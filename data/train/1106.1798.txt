    "the insight provided by the application of the ads / cft correspondence to finite density fermi systems has given brand new perspectives on the theoretical robustness of non - fermi liquids @xcite ; on an understanding of the non - perturbative stability of the regular fermi liquid equivalent to order parameter universality for bosons @xcite , and most importantly on the notion of fermionic criticality : fermi systems with no scale .",
    "in essence strongly coupled conformally invariant fermi systems are one answer to the grand theoretical question of fermionic condensed matter : _ are there finite density fermi systems that do not refer at any stage to an underlying perturbative fermi gas ? _    it is natural to ask to what extent ads / cft can provide a more complete answer to this question .",
    "assuming , almost tautologically , that the underlying system is strongly coupled and there is in addition some notion of a large @xmath0 limit , the fermi system is dual to classical general relativity with a negative cosmological constant coupled to charged fermions and electromagnetism . as ads / cft maps quantum numbers to quantum numbers , finite density configurations of the strongly coupled large @xmath0 system",
    "correspond to solutions of this einstein - maxwell - dirac theory with finite charge density .",
    "since the ads fermions are the only object carrying charge , and the gravity system is weakly coupled , one is immediately inclined to infer that the generic solution is a weakly coupled charged fermi gas coupled to ads gravity : in other words an ads electron star @xcite , the charged equivalent of a neutron star in asymptotically anti - de sitter space @xcite .",
    "nothing can seem more straightforward . given the total charge density @xmath1 of interest ,",
    "one constructs the free fermionic wavefunctions in this system , and fills them one by one in increasing energy until the total charge equals @xmath1 . for macroscopic values of @xmath1",
    "these fermions themselves will backreact on the geometry .",
    "one can compute this backreaction ; it changes the potential for the free fermions at subleading order . correcting the wavefunctions at this subleading order , one converges on the true solution order by order in the gravitational strength @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath3 is the energy carried by the fermi system and @xmath4 is the gravitational coupling constant @xmath5 in the ads gravity system .",
    "perturbation theory in @xmath6 is dual to the @xmath7 expansion in the associated condensed matter system .",
    "the starting point of the backreaction computation is to follow tolman - oppenheimer - volkov ( tov ) and use a thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation for the lowest order one - loop contribution @xcite .",
    "the thomas - fermi approximation applies when the number of constituent fermions making up the fermi gas is infinite . for neutral fermions",
    "this equates to the statement that the energy - spacing between the levels is neglible compared to the chemical potential associated with @xmath1 , @xmath8 . for charged fermions",
    "the thomas - fermi limit is more direct : it is the limit @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the charge of each constituent fermion . :",
    "thus @xmath11    this has been the guiding principle behind the approaches @xcite and the recent papers @xcite , with the natural assumption that all corrections beyond thomas - fermi are small quantitative changes rather than qualitative ones . on closer inspection",
    ", however , this completely natural tf - electron star poses a number of puzzles .",
    "the most prominent perhaps arises from the ads / cft correspondence finding that every normalizable fermionic wavefunction in the gravitational bulk corresponds to a fermionic quasiparticle excitation in the dual condensed matter system .",
    "in particular occupying a particular wavefunction is dual to having a particular fermi - liquid state @xcite . in the thomas fermi",
    "limit the gravity dual thus describes an infinity of fermi liquids , whereas the generic condensed matter expectation would have been that a been that a single(/few ) liquid(s ) would be the generic groundstate away from the strongly coupled fermionic quantum critical point at zero charge density .",
    "this zoo of fermi surfaces is already present in the grand canonical approaches at fixed @xmath12 ( extremal ads - reissner - nordstrm ( ads - rn ) black holes ) @xcite and a natural explanation would be that this is a large @xmath0 effect .",
    "this idea , that the gravity theory is dual to a condensed matter system with @xmath0 species of fermions , and increasing the charge density `` populates '' more and more of the distinct species of fermi liquids , is very surprising from the condensed matter perspective",
    ". away from criticality one would expect the generic groundstate to be a single fermi - liquid or some broken state due to pairing . to pose the puzzle sharply ,",
    "once one has a fermionic quasiparticle one should be able to adiabatically continue it to a free fermi gas , which would imply that the free limit of the strongly coupled fermionic cft is not a single but a system of order @xmath0 fermions with an ordered distribution of fermi - momenta .",
    "a possible explanation of the multitude of fermi surfaces that is consistent with a single fermi surface at weak coupling is that ads / cft describes so - called `` deconfined and/or fractionalized fermi - liquids '' where the number of fermi surfaces is directly tied to the coupling strength @xcite .",
    "it would argue that fermionic quantum criticality goes hand in hand with fractionalization for which there is currently scant experimental evidence .",
    "the second puzzle is more technical . since quantum numbers in the gravity system equal the quantum numbers in the dual condensed matter system ,",
    "one is inclined to infer that each subsequent ads fermion wavefunction has incrementally higher energy than the previous one .",
    "yet analyticity of the dirac equation implies that all normalizable wavefunctions must have strictly vanishing energy @xcite .",
    "it poses the question how the order in which the fermions populate the fermi gas is determined .",
    "the third puzzle is that in the thomas fermi limit the fermi gas is gravitationally strictly confined to a bounded region : famously , the tov - neutron star has an edge . in ads",
    "/ cft , however , all information about the dual condensed matter system is read off at asymptotic ads infinity .",
    "qualitatively , one can think of ads / cft as an `` experiment '' analogous to probing a spatially confined fermi gas with a tunneling microscope held to the exterior of the trap . extracting the information of the dual condensed matter system is probing the ads dirac system confined by a gravitoelectric trap instead of a magneto - optical trap for cold atoms . although the thomas - fermi limit should reliably capture the charge and energy densities in the system , its abrupt non - analytic change at the edge ( in a trapped system ) and effective absence of a density far away from the center are well known to cause qualitative deficiencies in the description of the system .",
    "specifically friedel oscillations  quantum interference in the outside tails of the charged fermion density , controlled by the ratio @xmath13 and measured by a tunneling microscope  are absent .",
    "analogously , there could be qualitative features in the ads asymptotics of both the gravito - electric background and the dirac wavefunctions in that adjusted background that are missed by the tf - approximation .",
    "the ads asymptotics in turn _ specify _ the physics of the dual condensed matter system and since our main interest is to use ads / cft to understand quantum critical fermion systems where @xmath13 is finite , the possibility of a qualitative change inherent in the thomas fermi limit should be considered .",
    "there is another candidate ads description of the dual of a strongly coupled finite density fermi system : the ads black hole with dirac hair @xcite .",
    "one arrives at this solution when one starts one s reasoning from the dual condensed matter system , rather than the dirac fields in ads gravity .",
    "insisting that the system collapses to a generic single species fermi - liquid ground state , the dual gravity description is that of an ads einstein - dirac - maxwell system with a single nonzero normalizable dirac wavefunction . to have a macroscopic backreaction",
    "the charge of this single dirac field must be macroscopic . the intuitive way to view this solution is as the other simplest approximation to free fermi gas coupled to gravity .",
    "what we mean is that the full gravito - electric response is in all cases controlled by the total charge @xmath1 of the solution : as charge is conserved it is proportional to the constituent charge @xmath10 times the number of fermions @xmath14 and the two simple limits correspond to @xmath15 with @xmath16 fixed or @xmath17 .",
    "the former is the thomas - fermi electron star , the latter is the ads dirac hair solution . in the context of ads / cft",
    "there is a significant difference between the two solutions in that the dirac hair solution clearly does not give rise to the puzzles 1 , 2 and 3 : there is by construction no zoo of fermi - surfaces and therefore no ordering .",
    "moreover since the wavefunction is demanded to be normalizable , it manifestly encodes the properties of the system at the ads boundary . on the other hand the ads dirac",
    "hair solution does pose the puzzle that under normal conditions the total charge @xmath1 is much larger than the constituent charge @xmath10 both from the gravity / string theory point of view and the condensed matter perspective .",
    "generically one would expect a fermi gas electron star rather than dirac hair .    in this article we shall provide evidence for this point of view that the ads electron star and the ads dirac hair solution are two limits of the same underlying system .",
    "specifically we shall show that ( 1 ) the electron star solution indeed has the constituent charge as a free parameter which is formally sent to zero to obtain the thomas - fermi approximation . ( 2 ) the number of normalizable wavefunctions in the electron star depend on the value of the constituent charge @xmath10 .",
    "we show this by computing the electron star spectral functions .",
    "they depend in similar way on @xmath10 as the first ads / cft fermi system studies in an ads - rn background . in the formal limit where @xmath18",
    ", only one normalizable mode remains and the spectral function wavefunction resembles the dirac hair solution , underlining their underlying equivalence . since both approximations have qualitative differences as a description of the ads dual to strongly coupled fermionic systems , it argues that an improved approximation which has characteristics of both is called for .",
    "the results here are complimentary to and share an analysis of electron star spectral functions with the two recent articles @xcite and @xcite that appeared in the course of this work ( see also @xcite for fermion spectral functions in general lifshitz backgrounds ) .",
    "our motivation to probe the system away from the direct electron star limit differs : we have therefore been more precise in defining this limit and in the analysis of the dirac equation in the electron star background .",

    "similarly @xmath50    the adiabatic approximation is valid for highly localized wavefunctions , i.e. the expression must be dominated by high momenta ( especially in the radial direction ) .",
    "the exact expression on the other hand will not have a continuum of solutions to the harmonic condition @xmath51 .",
    "normalizable solutions to the ads dirac equations only occur at discrete momenta  one can think of the gravitational background as a potential well .",
    "the adiabatic approximation is therefore equivalent to the thomas - fermi approximation for a fermi - gas in a box .    to get an estimate for the parameter range where the adiabatic approximation holds , consider the adiabatic bound @xmath52 . using the field equation for @xmath53 : @xmath54 this bound is equivalent to requiring @xmath55 where in the last line we used the original bound again .",
    "if the chemical potential scale is considerably higher than the mass of the fermion , we may use to approximate @xmath56 .",
    "thus the adiabatic bound is equivalent to , @xmath57 the statement that the constituent charge of the fermions is infinitesimal .",
    "note that in the rescaled action ( [ eq:1 ] , [ eq:16 ] ) , @xmath58 plays the role of @xmath59 , and eq .",
    "is thus equivalent to the semiclassical limit @xmath60 with @xmath61 fixed .",
    "since ads / cft relates @xmath62 this acquires the meaning in the context of holography that there is a large @xmath63 scaling limit @xcite of the cft with fermionic operators where the rg - flow is `` adiabatic '' .",
    "returning to the gravitational description the additional assumption that the chemical potential is much larger than the mass is equivalent to @xmath64 this implies that the total charge density in ads is much larger than that of a single charged particle ( as long as @xmath65 ) .",
    "the adiabatic limit is therefore equivalent to a thermodynamic limit where the fermi gas consists of an infinite number of constituents , @xmath66 , @xmath67 such that the total charge @xmath68 remains finite .",
    "the adiabatic limit of a many - body fermion system coupled to gravity are the tolman - oppenheimer - volkov equations .",
    "solving this in asymptotically ads gives us the charged neutron or electron star constructed in @xcite .",
    "knowing the quantitative form of the adiabatic limit , it is now easy to distinguish the electron star solution from the `` single wavefunction '' dirac hair solution .",
    "the latter is trivially the single particle limit @xmath69 , @xmath70 with the total charge @xmath1 finite .",
    "the electron star and dirac hair black hole are opposing limit - solutions of the same system .",
    "we shall now make this connection more visible by identifying a formal dialing parameter that interpolates between the two solutions .",
    "to do so we shall need the full adiabatic tolman - oppenheimer - volkov equations for the ads electron star @xcite . since the fluid is homogeneous and isotropic , the background metric and electrostatic potential will respect these symmetries and will be of the form ( recall that we are already using `` dimensionless '' lengths , eq . ) ds^2=-f(r)dt^2+g(r)dr^2+r^2(dx^2+dy^2 ) ,  a = h(r)dt , where @xmath71 are functions of @xmath72 ; the horizon is located at @xmath73 and the boundary is at @xmath74 . combining this ansatz with a rescaling @xmath75 the bosonic background equations of motion become @xcite @xmath76 where we have used that @xmath77 and @xmath78 is the rescaled local charge density .",
    "what one immediately notes is that the tolman - oppenheimer - volkov equations of motion for the background only depend on the parameters @xmath79 and @xmath80 , whereas the original lagrangian and the fermion equation of motion also depend on @xmath81 .",
    "it is therefore natural to guess that the parameter @xmath82 will be the interpolating parameter away from the adiabatic electron star limit towards the dirac hair bh .",
    "indeed in these natural electron star variables the adiabatic bound translates into @xmath83 thus we see that for a given electron star background with @xmath84 fixed decreasing @xmath85 improves the adiabatic fluid approximation whereas increasing @xmath85 makes the adiabatic approximation poorer and poorer .",
    "`` dialing @xmath85 up / down '' therefore _ interpolates _ between the electron star and the dirac hair bh .",
    "counterintuively improving adiabaticity by decreasing @xmath85 corresponds to increasing @xmath61 for fixed @xmath10 , but this is just a consequence of recasting the system in natural electron star variables . a better way to view improving adiabaticity is to decrease the microscopic charge @xmath10 but while keeping @xmath86 fixed ; this shows that a better way to think of @xmath61 is as the total charge rather than the efffective constituent charge .",
    "the parameter @xmath87 parametrizes the gravitational coupling strength in units of the ads curvature , and one might worry that `` dialing @xmath85 up '' pushes one outside the regime of classical gravity .",
    "this is not the case .",
    "one can easily have @xmath88 and tune @xmath85 towards or away from the adiabatic limit within the regime of classical gravity . from eq .",
    "we see that the edge of validity of the adiabatic regime @xmath89 is simply equivalent to a microscopic charge @xmath90 which clearly has a classical gravity description .",
    "it is not hard to see that the statement above is the equivalent of changing the level splitting in the fermi gas , while keeping the overall energy / charge fixed . in a fermi gas",
    "microscopically both the overall energy and the level splitting depends on @xmath91 . naively increasing @xmath91 increases both , but one can move away from the adiabatic limit either by decreasing the overall charge density , keeping @xmath91 fixed or by keeping the charge density fixed and raising @xmath91 .",
    "using again the analogy between @xmath85 and @xmath91 , the electron star situation is qualitatively the same where one should think of @xmath92 parametrizing the microscopic charge .",
    "one can either insist on keeping @xmath85 fixed and _ increase _ the microscopic charge @xmath84 to increase the level splitting or one can keep @xmath84 fixed and increase @xmath85 . in the electron star , however , the background geometry changes with @xmath84 in addition to the level splitting , and it is therefore more straightforward to keep @xmath84 and the geometry fixed , while dialing @xmath85",
    ".    we will now give evidence for our claim that the electron star and dirac hair solution are two opposing limits .",
    "to do so , we need to identify an observable that goes either beyond the adiabatic background approximation or beyond the single particle approximation .",
    "since the generic intermediate state is still a many - body fermion system , the more natural starting point is the electron star background and perturb away from there .",
    "realizing then that the fermion equation of motion already depends directly on the dialing parameter @xmath61 the obvious observables are the single fermion spectral functions in the electron star background .",
    "since one must specify a value for @xmath61 to compute these , they directly probe the microscopic charge of the fermion and are thus always beyond the strict electron star limit @xmath93 . in the next two sections we will compute these and show that they indeed reflect the interpretation of @xmath61 as the interpolating parameter between the electron star and dirac hair bh .",
    "to compute the fermion spectral functions in the electron star background we shall choose a specific representative of the family of electron stars parametrized by @xmath84 and @xmath80 .",
    "rather than using @xmath84 and @xmath80 the metric of an electron star is more conveniently characterized by its lifshitz - scaling behavior near the interior horizon @xmath94 . from the field equations the limiting interior behavior of @xmath95 is @xmath96 the scaling behavior",
    "is determined by the dynamical critical exponent @xmath97 , which is a function of @xmath98 @xcite and it is conventionally used to classify the metric instead of @xmath84 .",
    "the full electron star metric is then generated from this horizon scaling behavior by integrating up an irrelevant rg - flow @xcite @xmath99 with @xmath100 scaling @xmath101 is equal to a coordinate transformation @xmath102 and @xmath103 , and the sign of @xmath104 is fixed to be negative in order to be able to match onto an asymptotically ads@xmath105 solution .",
