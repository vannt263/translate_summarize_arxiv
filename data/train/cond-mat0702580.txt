    "<S> controllable adiabatic evolution of a multi - qubit system can be used for adiabatic quantum computation ( aqc ) . </S>",
    "<S> this evolution ends at a configuration where the hamiltonian of the system encodes the solution of the problem to be solved . as a first steps towards realization of aqc we have investigated two , three and four flux qubit systems . </S>",
    "<S> these systems were characterized by making use of a radio - frequency method . </S>",
    "<S> we designed two - qubit systems with coupling energies up to several kelvins . </S>",
    "<S> for the three - flux - qubit systems we determined the complete ground - state flux diagram in the three dimensional flux space around the qubits common degeneracy point . we show that the systems hamiltonian can be completely reconstructed from our measurements . </S>",
    "<S> our concept for the implementation of aqc , by making use of flux qubits , is discussed . </S>"
