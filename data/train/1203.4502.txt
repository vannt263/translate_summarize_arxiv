    "this article is about the mathematical analysis of new fiber lay - down equations developed recently in @xcite . herein fiber lay - down processes arise in the production process of nonwovens and the expression is used for the description of the forms generated by the stochastic lay - down of flexible fibers .",
    "the understanding , optimization and mathematical simulation of such fiber webs is of great industrial interest , we refer to @xcite and references therein .",
    "areas of application where these stochastic lay - down processes can be observed include e.g.  composite materials ( filters ) , textiles , as well as the hygiene industry . in @xcite a general mathematical model describing the full fiber spinning process is introduced and is nowadays implemented in the software tool fydist developed at the fraunhofer itwm , kaiserslautern .",
    "nevertheless , the numerical simulation leads to excessively large computation times .",
    "hence it would be desirable to have simplified stochastic models at hand simulating a virtual fiber web in a fast and efficient way .",
    "the first of such surrogate models , the basic two - dimensional model , is developed in @xcite and reads as some it stochastic differential equation ( sde ) in @xmath2 of the form @xmath3 here @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 is a nonnegative constant and @xmath7 is a standard one - dimensional brownian motion .",
    "@xmath8 is a suitable function called the potential .",
    "this basic model has been extended in @xcite to the more realistic three - dimensional case which serves as starting point for all our mathematical studies in the underlying article . and exactly this extension to the three - dimensional case requires the usage of a differentialgeometric language .",
    "at first we discuss the geometry underlying the previously mentioned equation introduced in @xcite . starting with the two - dimensional model we present a new differential geometric derivation and formulation of the model from @xcite in each dimension @xmath9 ,",
    "therefore we formulate equation first in its most natural way on @xmath10 .",
    "the latter space is diffeomorphic to @xmath11 where @xmath12 stands as usual for the unit sphere .",
    "consequently , we get the analogue equation of living on @xmath11 . the resulting equation can then directly be translated to higher dimensions and yields the final @xmath13-dimensional fiber lay - down model given as some manifold - valued stratonovich sde with state space @xmath0 by @xmath14 here @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath7 is a standard @xmath13-dimensional brownian motion , see section [ differentialgeometric_modeling ] for details .",
    "this precise fomulation is also necessary for all the forthcoming analysis and we strongly believe that the geometric derivation can be helpful for every applied mathematician who aims to derive similiar manifold - valued stochastic equations . furthermore , we provide concret numerical simulation formulas of in specific local coordinate systems , so called local sdes . as consequence , for @xmath17",
    "we obtain back and for @xmath18 the local sde reduces to the three - dimensional model derived in @xcite .",
    "we finish the geometric discussion in section [ solutions_sdes ] .",
    "therein we further discuss basic existence statements of all occuring stochastic equations by constructing global solutions to the basic two - dimensional model with state space @xmath2 and the general geometric fiber lay - down model living on @xmath0 .    of course , the cases @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the physical relevant ones .",
    "nevertheless , for all the forthcoming analysis , it is elegant to study equation in its general mathematical form .",
    "we emphasize that our upcoming stochastic and functionalanalytic considerations of the @xmath13-dimensional fiber lay - down model are done in a coordinate free way .    the density of the stochastic process solving satisfes the associated fokker - planck evolution equation .",
    "an important criterion for the quality of the fiber web and the resulting nonwoven material is how fast the process converges towards its stationary state . of essential interest",
    "is therefore the speed of convergence .",
    "moreover , from a practical point of view , process parameters should be adjusted in order to obtain optimal convergence to equilbrium .",
    "this motivates that we devote the main interest in the underlying paper to the study of the long - time behaviour of the @xmath13-dimensional fiber lay - down equation . demanding mathematical difficulties",
    "are then occuring due to the degeneracity of .",
    "the convergence to equilibrium of the flat  two - dimensional fiber lay - down model is already analyzed in several articles . basing upon the theory of dirichlet forms and operator semigroups , the approach of @xcite gives an ergodic theorem and establishes explicit rates of convergence .",
    "the underlying object of study therein is the two - dimensional fiber lay - down kolmogorov pde and its corresponding kolmogorov operator .",
    "another approach is presented in @xcite .",
    "there the authors analyze the two - dimensional fiber lay - down fokker - planck pde together with its associated generator and prove convergence to equilibrium with an exponential , explicitly computable rate of convergence .",
    "this approach uses modern methods from @xcite in which a new hypocoercivity theory in a hilbert space setting is developed . for a general study of the theory of hypocoercivity",
    ", the reader may consult @xcite .",
    "finally , the quite recently published article @xcite uses a probabilistic approach .",
    "the authors are able to derive strong mixing properties under weak assumptions on the potential and , assuming some stronger conditions , they can prove geometric ergodicity of the two - dimensional fiber lay - down process .    in section [ section_mixing_properties ]",
    "we start studying the long time behaviour of our general , geometric @xmath13-dimensional fiber lay - down process by proving strong mixing properties , see theorem [ thm_strong_mixing ] .",
    "the approach is disjoint and different to the one given in the two - dimensional setting in @xcite , and moreover , it has even been developed at the same time independently .",
    "our approach works for smooth potentials @xmath19 .",
    "this is a slightly stronger assumption as made in @xcite in the two - dimensional case .",
    "nevertheless , our strategy applies to the full manifold - valued @xmath13-dimensional fiber lay - down sde containing especially the two - dimensional situation .",
    "we make use of a new version of doob s theorem , see @xcite , which perfectly fits into the fiber lay - down setting .",
    "afterwards , we switch to functional analysis and apply the fascinating and powerful hypocoercivity theory from @xcite once more , see section [ section_hypocoercivity ] .",
    "we generalize the strategy in @xcite to the @xmath13-dimensional setting requiring some differential geometric tools .",
    "the object of interest in this section is the hypoelliptic kolmogorov operator associated to given by @xmath20 which is analyzed in an appropriately chosen @xmath21-space . in particular , we make use of modern entropy methods . we obtain convergence to equilibrium exponentially fast with explicitly computable rate of convergence , see theorem [ thm_hypocoercivity ] .",
    "moreover , in section [ setup_and_notations ] we introduce some basic geometric language and give a short introduction to the concept of manifold - valued stratonovich sdes .",
    "further useful statements needed for our analysis are proven in the appendix .",
    "finally , the progress achieved in this paper may be summarized by the following list of main results :    * differential geometric derivation and formulation of the fiber lay - down model in each dimension as some manifold - valued stratonovich sde . * construction of strong solutions to all occuring fiber lay - down equations .",

    "we use modern hilbert space methods from the theory of hypocoercivity developed in @xcite .",
    "before starting we introduce some notations , fix the language concerning the @xmath13-sphere and give a short introduction to the concept of stratonovich stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) on manifolds .",
