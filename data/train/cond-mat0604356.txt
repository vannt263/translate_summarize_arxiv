    "the effects of disorder on the phase behavior has been investigated in a multitude of statistical mechanics models and there is by now a good understanding of the ensuing equilibrium phenomena @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics , the effect of disorder on dynamics and non - equilibrium steady state is far from being well understood @xcite .",
    "one of the best studied cases is the _ totally asymmetric simple exclusion process _ ( tasep ) @xcite .",
    "it is defined as a one - dimensional lattice gas where particles are hopping stochastically in one direction subject to hard - core repulsion ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "two types of disorder have been studied : hopping rates may either depend on the particle attempting to jump ( _ particle - wise disorder _ @xcite or each lattice site may be associated may be associated with a random quenched hopping rate ( _ site - wise disorder _ ) @xcite .",
    "as intuitively expected , such defects generically induce phase separations if the particle traffic exceeds a certain threshold @xcite .",
    "our studies are motivated by an important class of intracellular transport processes mediated by molecular motors like kinesin , dyneins or myosins moving along cytoskeletal filaments like microtubules or f - actin @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of each of these molecular engines is a complicated stochastic process which we idealize by a poisson process with a single rate limiting step only .",
    "there is now convincing evidence that transport along the cytoskeletal filaments is one - dimensional and binding sites are periodically spaced @xcite .",
    "since each of the binding sites can be occupied by at most one of the molecular motors , particle exclusion can play a crucial role . though there is no clear evidence _ in vivo",
    "_ , at the moment , that motor densities are large enough for particle exclusion to dominate the transport properties , there are _ in vitro _ investigations underway studying the transport of kinesin along microtubules at high volume concentrations @xcite .",
    "each molecular track has a finite length , and in general one would like to allow for the enzyme reservoirs at both ends to have different densities and/or attachment rate at the left and right end to be different from each other and different from the hopping rate in the bulk .",
    "all this taken together defines the tasep , introduced originally as model for the kinetics of biopolymerisation on nucleic acid template @xcite . for it to be a proper minimal model for molecular intracellular transport",
    "it also has to account for the fact that microtubules are embedded in the cytosol with a reservoir of motors in solution .",
    "this allows for motors to attach from the solution to the molecular track or detach from it and become part of the reservoir again @xcite .",
    "then one arrives at the tasep with langmuir kinetics ( tasep / lk ) introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , which exhibits phase separation even in the absence of any defects .    in this paper",
    "we would like to study the effect of an isolated defect on the non - equilibrium steady state of this minimal model for intracellular transport .",
    "we focus on a site - wise disorder which may be mediated by structural imperfections of the microtubular structure or proteins associated to the microtubules that change the affinity of the motors with the track .",
    "there has been evidence that these microtubule associated proteins might even be responsible for some diseases connected to motor proteins @xcite .",
    "let us now introduce the model under investigation .",
    "we consider a simple exclusion process on a finite lattice with @xmath0 sites ( labeled @xmath1 ) , where the occupation number @xmath2 of each site can be either @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "the dynamics of the system is described by a fully unidirectional continuum stochastic process in which each particle jumps randomly with rate @xmath5 to its right - neighboring vacant site . at the left boundary particles",
    "are introduced in the lattice with rate @xmath6 , while at the right boundary they are extracted with rate @xmath7 .",
    "this defines what is known as totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) for @xmath8 ( we define the time scale by setting @xmath9 ) .",
    "we supplement this process in two ways , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pffdef ] : ( a ) the system is coupled to a bulk reservoir via langmuir kinetics ; namely particles can attach to a site in the bulk with rate @xmath10 and can detach with rate @xmath11 @xcite ; ( b ) a special site @xmath12 of the system represents a bottleneck and has a slower hopping rate @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "both cases have been _ separately _ studied previously and show non - trivial features . in this work",
    "we investigate the combined effect of these two perturbations to the usual tasep : our study concerns a detailed analysis of the non - equilibrium steady state properties , with emphasis on the resulting phase - diagrams",
    ". two essential ingredients to carry on such an analysis are the local density of particles @xmath14 and current profile @xmath15 ; where the brackets stand for the average over the histories .",
    "following the same steps as in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite for a recent review ) , the stationary density is shown to obey an hierarchy of equations involving nearest - neighbor correlation functions : @xmath16 where , to account for the defect at site @xmath17 , we have : @xmath18 to be sure to capture an interesting interplay between boundary induced phenomena and bulk dynamics ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) we shall consider a _",
    "mesoscopic limit _ where local adsorption - desorption rates are rescaled such that the gross rates @xmath19 are comparable to the injection - extraction rates at the boundaries : @xmath20 keeping fixed the gross rates , in the limit @xmath21 , introduces interesting competition between boundaries and bulk .",
    "schematic representation of the tasep with on - off kinetics in the presence of a bottleneck at the site @xmath17 .",
    "the allowed moves are : forward jump ( with rate @xmath22 in @xmath17 and @xmath9 elsewhere ) , entrance at the left boundary ( with rate @xmath6 ) and exit at the right boundary ( with rate @xmath7 ) , attachment ( with rate @xmath10 ) , and detachment ( with rate @xmath11 ) in the bulk . ]    this work is organized as follows : the next section summarizes the main properties of the tasep , tasep coupled to the langmuir kinetics and tasep with a single inhomogeneity . in section [ sec : setup ] , we outline the effective theory on which we build our analysis . section [ sec : result ]",
    "is devoted to the discussion of our results ( phase - diagrams and density profiles ) .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "the effective theory presented hereafter is built on the properties of models akin to the one under consideration here , namely the tasep and tasep coupled to langmuir kinetics .",
    "it is thus appropriate to briefly review the main features of the latter and to summarize the result for the simple tasep in the presence of a single inhomogeneity .      in the absence of attachment and detachment and with uniform hopping rate , the model defined above reduces to the tasep .",
    "much is known about the non - equilibrium steady state of this paradigmatic model .",
    "both exact methods @xcite and approximated mean - field solutions @xcite show that as a function of the entrance and exit rates there are three distinct non - equilibrium steady states .",
    "for @xmath23 and @xmath24 there is a _ high density _ phase ( hd ) , where both the density and the current are determined by the exit rate @xmath7 .",
    "mean - field theory gives a spatially constant density @xmath25 larger than @xmath26 and a constant current @xmath27 .",
    "thus the current is dominated by the low exit rate which acts as a bottleneck for the transport .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath28 and @xmath29 the low entrance rate is the limiting factor for the particle current which is now given by @xmath30 . since @xmath31 is always smaller than @xmath26 in this parameter range , the phase is also termed the _ low density _ ( ld ) phase .",
    "if both @xmath6 and @xmath7 become larger than the critical value @xmath26 the density becomes constant @xmath32 independently of the parameters at the boundaries .",
    "the current is limited by the particle exclusion in the bulk and its maximal value is @xmath33 ; therefore , this phase was termed _",
    "maximal current _",
    "( mc ) phase .      supplementing the tasep , a genuine driven ( non - equilibrium ) process , with on - off ( or langmuir , equilibrium ) kinetics results in a system termed tasep / lk . if the rates of the langmuir kinetics are faster than , or comparable to , the hopping rates , the on - off kinetics always dominates the driven process . to guarantee the particles to cover a relevant portion of the lattice before detaching , the _ mesoscopic limit _ mentioned in eq .",
    "( [ eq : meso ] ) has been introduced @xcite .",
    "this imposes a time scale where competition between the boundary , driven processes and the on - off kinetics , is effective and results in rich collective phenomena .",
    "considering eqs .",

    "this equation obviously has two solutions : a linear one with slope @xmath40 and a constant one coinciding with the critical density of the tasep : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a constant to be determined by the boundary conditions .",

    "( [ eq : sol ] ) can not be matched continuously with the left and right boundaries ( [ eq : tasep_lk_bc ] ) , the density profile displays a localized discontinuity ( or shock ) in the bulk .",
    "this translates into the emergence of mixed phases .",
    "the latter are discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite and are summarized in the tasep / lk phase - diagram of fig .",

    "currents a domain wall develops and connects the left ( @xmath62 ) and right ( @xmath63 ) density profile.,title=\"fig : \" ]      before presenting the details of our theoretical treatment of the tasep / lk system in the presence of a bottleneck , and to gain some intuitive understanding of the underlying physics , it is convenient to outline the properties of the simple tasep perturbed by a localized inhomogeneity @xcite .",
    "here we consider the tasep with a defect at site @xmath12 where the hopping rate is @xmath64 .",
    "consider the ld phase , where the system is ` diluted ' and the particles are well separated .",
    "in such a `` low traffic '' situation , one does not expect any macroscopic effects arising from the presence of the bottleneck .",
    "one rather expects a local peak in the density profile ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : spike1]a ) : @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( ld phase ) , where @xmath67 is the height of the local jump imposed by the defect .",
    "since an exclusion process without coupling to a bulk reservoir has a spatially constant current @xmath30 , one finds @xmath68 .",
    "thus the height of the density peak increases with @xmath6 and @xmath69 .",
    "this can certainly not happen without bound .",
    "in fact , @xmath67 can not exceed @xmath70 .",
    "this may be seen as follows .",
    "if @xmath71 , there would be a site @xmath72 such that @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "this case has to be discarded as it contradicts current conservation : @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , for given @xmath6 and @xmath7 , there is a critical value of @xmath76 below which the local peak is no longer a possible solution .",
    "the critical @xmath76 follows from the requirement that the height of the peak can not exceed @xmath77 , i.e.  @xmath78 .",
    "one thus finds @xmath79 equivalently , if one keeps @xmath80 fixed , a local peak is obtained for @xmath81    it directly follows from the underlying particle - hole symmetry that the same reasoning holds in the hd phase ( @xmath82 and @xmath23 ) .",
    "there the system is so ` packed ' that the bottleneck is only responsible for a local dip in the density profile : @xmath83 and @xmath84 , with @xmath85 .",
    "thus , in the hd phase , a local dip is only possible for @xmath86 or , keeping @xmath80 fixed , for @xmath87    [ ] [ ] [ 1][-90]@xmath55    [ cols= \" < , > \" , ]     on the other hand , when @xmath88 it follows from the analytical solution of the above - mentioned mf equation that there is only one screening length on the subsystem .",
    "in fact , it turns out that the left branch of @xmath89 can never reach the maximal current @xmath90 on the subsystem (so , for @xmath88 , there is no finite screening length on the subsystem  ) : the screening length may only be shorter than the length of the subsystem , with the point @xmath91 .",
    "it follows that carrying capacities of types @xmath92 and @xmath93 are topologically prohibited ( even in the asymmetric case @xmath94 ) when @xmath88 .",
    "in contrast to the case @xmath59 , as in general the current @xmath95 can not reach the value @xmath90 , the carrying capacity of type @xmath96 gives rise to four bottleneck phases ( instead of six as for the case @xmath59 ) , namely the ld - bp - hd , ld - bp - mc , bp - hd and bp - mc .",
    "an example of bp - mc current and density profiles is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eg3 ] ( right ) .",
    "this work has been devoted to the study of the influence of a bottleneck ( point - wise disorder ) on the stationary properties of a biologically inspired stochastic transport model obtained by coupling two paradigmatic equilibrium and non - equilibrium processes .",
    "namely , we have considered the competition between the _ totally asymmetric exclusion process _ ( tasep ) and langmuir kinetics ( lk ) in the presence of open boundaries and a bottleneck , which locally slows down any incoming particles .",
    "the current and density profiles in the non - equilibrium steady state have been investigated analytically via an effective mean - field theory built on splitting the lattice into two subsystems .",
    "our analytical results were checked against numerical ( monte - carlo ) simulations .    as a consequence of the competition between the tasep and lk dynamics , the effects of a single bottleneck in the tasep / lk model are much more dramatic than in the simple tasep @xcite , or the so - called @xmath97tasep ( tasep for extended objects ) @xcite , where a localized defect was shown to merely shift some transitions line in the phase - diagram , but do not affect its topology . here , new and mixed phases induced by the bottleneck have been obtained .    as a key concept of our analysis",
    ", we have introduced the _ carrying capacity _ , which is defined as the maximal current that can flow through the bulk of the system .",
    "in contrast to the simple tasep the spatial dependence of the current , caused by the langmuir kinetics , makes the carrying capacity non - trivial : the defect depletes the current profile within a distance that we called _",
    "screening length_. this quantity increases with the strength of the defect and decreases with the attachment - detachment rates . the competition between the current imposed at the boundaries and the one limited by the defect determines the density profiles and the ensuing phase diagram . when the boundary currents dominant , the phase behavior of the defect - free system is recovered .",
    "also , above some critical entrance and exit rates , the system transports the maximal current , independently of the boundaries . between these two extreme situations ,",
    "we have found several coexistence phases , where the density profile exhibits stable shocks and kinks . indeed , above some specific parameter values the phase - diagram is characterized by _",
    "bottleneck phases_. depending on the screening length imposed by the defect , which can cover the entire system or part of it , different phases - diagrams arise .",
    "the latter are characterized by four , six or nine bottleneck phases , which have been quantitatively studied within our mean - field theory .",
    "the analysis carried out in this work can be straightforwardly extended to many variants of the tasep / lk model . as an example , let us mention the case of a lattice gas where dimers ( modelling the usual two heads of molecular motors ) would move as bound entities according to the @xmath97tasep ( with @xmath98 ) @xcite and could experience an langmuir - like on - off kinetics .",
    "recently , such a system has been studied ( without disorder ) within an appropriate mean - field - like scheme @xcite .",
    "the point - wise version of this system could be investigated along the same lines described in the present work .",
    "in addition to direct extensions , we think that the method outlined in this paper could pave the way to study the tasep / lk models in more ` realistic ' and biophysically relevant situations , as in the presence of clusters of competing defects or quenched site - wise randomness .",
