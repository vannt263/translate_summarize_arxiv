    "one of the possibly best known problems in combinatorial geometry asks how often the same distance can occur among @xmath7 points in the plane . via scaling we",

    "it is announced at several places that no finite @xmath6-regular matchstick graph does exist , see e.  g. ivars peterson s mathtrek `` match sticks in the summer '' @xcite most likely referring to personal communication with heiko harborth , the discoverer of the @xmath4-regular matchstick graph .",
    "indeed heiko harborth posed the question whether there exists a @xmath6-regular matchstick graph , or not at an oberwolfach meeting and was aware of a preprint claiming the non - existence proof ( personal communication ) .",
    "after a while he found out that there were some mistakes in the proof , so that to his knowledge there is no correct proof of the non - existence . asking the author of this preprint about the state of this problem he replied too , that the problem is still open ( at this point in time the concerning was untraceable ) .",

    "asking erich friedman for a proof of this claim he responded that unfortunately he lost his reference but also thinks that such a graph can not exist .",
    "in @xcite the authors list five publications where they have mentioned an unpublished proof for the non - existence of a @xmath6-regular matchstick graph and state that up to their knowledge the problem is open .    after the submission of this paper one of the referees came up with a very short proof for the non - existence @xcite . in this paper",
    "we would like to give a different , admittedly more complicated , proof using a topological equation that needs some explanation .",
    "so in some parts this ( unpublished ) paper coincides with @xcite .",
    "in the meantime heiko harborth could recover the lost preprint and send it to the original author and myself .",
    "curiously enough , after rectifying some annoying minor mistakes , the preprint turns out to be basically correct .",
    "so the author of this article took the opportunity to retype and slightly modify the original manuscript , see @xcite .",
    "it even turned out that the underlying method can be easily adopted to prove the following stronger result : no finite matchstick graph with minimum degree @xmath6 does exist .",
