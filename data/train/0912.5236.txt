    "i will discuss some recent results on observational tests @xcite of a model cosmology , which represents a new approach to understanding the phenomenology of dark energy as a consequence of the effect of the growth of inhomogeneous structures .",
    "the basic idea , outlined in a nontechnical manner in ref .",
    "@xcite , is that as inhomogeneities grow one must consider not only their backreaction on average cosmic evolution  as discussed by other contributors to this volume  but also the variance in the geometry as it affects the calibration of clocks and rods of ideal observers .",
    "dark energy is then effectively realised as a misidentification of gravitational energy gradients .",
    "although the standard lambda cold dark matter ( ) model provides a good fit to many tests , there are tensions between some tests , and also a number of puzzles and anomalies .",
    "furthermore , at the present epoch the observed universe is only statistically homogeneous once one samples on scales of 150300 mpc .",
    "below such scales it displays a web  like structure , dominated in volume by voids .",
    "some 40%50% of the volume of the present epoch universe is in voids with @xmath0 on scales of 30@xmath1 mpc @xcite , where @xmath2 is the dimensionless parameter related to the hubble constant by @xmath3 .",
    "once one also accounts for numerous minivoids , and perhaps also a few larger voids , then it appears that the present epoch universe is void - dominated .",
    "clusters of galaxies are spread in sheets that surround these voids , and in thin filaments that thread them .",
    "one particular consequence of a matter distribution that is only statistically homogeneous , rather than exactly homogeneous , is that when the einstein equations are averaged they do not evolve as a smooth friedmann ",
    "lematre  robertson  walker ( flrw ) geometry .",
    "instead the friedmann equations are supplemented by additional backreaction terms @xcite .",
    "whether or not one can fully explain the expansion history of the universe as a consequence of the growth of inhomogeneities and backreaction , without a fluid  like dark energy , is the subject of ongoing debate @xcite .",
    "elsewhere in this volume , peebles @xcite provides some of the arguments that have been presented against backreaction .",
    "his line of reasoning is that of a plausibility argument : if we _ assume _ a flrw geometry with small perturbations , and estimate the magnitude of the perturbations from the typical rotational and peculiar velocities of galaxies , then the corrections of inhomogeneities are consistently small .",
    "this would be a powerful argument , were it not for the fact that at the present epoch galaxies are not homogeneously distributed .",
    "the hubble deep field reveals that galaxies were close to being homogeneous distributed at early epochs , but following the growth voids at redshifts @xmath4 that is no longer the case today .",
    "therefore galaxies can not be consistently treated as randomly distributed gas particles on the 30@xmath1 mpc scales @xcite that dominate present cosmic structure below the scale of statistical homogeneity .    over the past few years",
    "i have developed a new physical interpretation of cosmological solutions within the buchert averaging scheme @xcite .",
    "i start by noting that in the presence of strong spatial curvature gradients , not only should the average evolution equations be replaced by equations with terms involving backreaction , but the physical interpretation of average quantities must also account for the differences between the local geometry and the average geometry . in other words , geometric variance can be just as important as geometric averaging when it comes to the physical interpretation of the expansion history of the universe .",
    "i proceed from the fact that structure formation provides a natural division of scales in the observed universe . as observers in galaxies , we and the objects we observe in other galaxies are necessarily in bound structures , which formed from density perturbations that were greater than critical density .",
    "if we consider the evidence of the large scale structure surveys on the other hand , then the average location by volume in the present epoch universe is in a void , which is negatively curved .",
    "we can expect systematic differences in spatial curvature between the average mass environment , in bound structures , and the volume - average environment , in voids .",
    "spatial curvature gradients will in general give rise to gravitational energy gradients . physically this can be understood in terms of a relative deceleration of expanding regions of different densities .",
    "those in the denser region decelerate more and age less . since we are dealing with weak fields the relative deceleration of",
    "the background is small . nonetheless even if the relative deceleration is typically of order @xmath5ms@xmath6 , cumulatively over the age of the universe it leads to significant clock rate variances @xcite .",
    "i proceed from an ansatz that the variance in gravitational energy is correlated with the average spatial curvature in such a way as to implicitly solve the sandage  de vaucouleurs paradox that a statistically quiet , broadly isotropic , hubble flow is observed deep below the scale of statistical homogeneity .",
    "in particular , galaxy peculiar velocities have a small magnitude with respect to a local regional volume expansion .",
    "expanding regions of different densities are patched together so that the regionally measured expansion remains uniform .",
    "such regional expansion refers to the variation of the regional proper length , @xmath7 , with respect to proper time of isotropic observers ( those who see an isotropic mean cmb ) .",
    "although voids open up faster , so that their proper volume increases more quickly , on account of gravitational energy gradients the local clocks will also tick faster in a compensating manner .",
    "details of the fitting of local observables to average quantities for solutions to the buchert formalism are described in detail in refs.@xcite .",
    "negatively curved voids , and spatially flat expanding wall regions within which galaxy clusters are located , are combined in a buchert average ( t)+(t)=1,where @xmath8 is the _ wall volume fraction _ and @xmath9 is the _ void volume fraction _ , @xmath10 being the present horizon volume , and @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 initial values at last scattering .",
    "the time parameter , @xmath14 , is the volume ",
    "average time parameter of the buchert formalism , but does not coincide with that of local measurements in galaxies . in trying to fit a flrw solution to the universe we attempt to match our local spatially flat wall geometry ^2=-^2+^2 ( ) .",
    "[ wgeom]to the whole universe , when in reality the rods and clocks of ideal isotropic observers vary with gradients in spatial curvature and gravitational energy . by conformally matching radial null geodesics with those of the buchert average solutions",
    ", the geometry ( [ wgeom ] ) may be extended to cosmological scales as the dressed geometry ^2=-^2+^2()[dgeom]where @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the relative lapse function between wall clocks and volume  average ones , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is given by integrating @xmath20 $ ] along null geodesics .",
    "in addition to the bare cosmological parameters which describe the buchert equations , one obtains dressed parameters relative to the geometry ( [ dgeom ] ) .",
    "for example , the dressed matter density parameter is @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the bare matter density parameter .",
    "the dressed parameters take numerical values close to the ones inferred in standard flrw models .",
    "the gradient in gravitational energy and cumulative differences of clock rates between wall observers and volume average ones has important physical consequences . using the exact solution obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , one finds that a volume average observer would infer an effective deceleration parameter @xmath23 , which is always positive since there is no global acceleration .",
    "however , a wall observer infers a dressed deceleration parameter q=-1h^2 a^2",
    "a^2= -(8 ^ 3 + 39 ^ 2 - 12 - 8)(4++4 ^ 2)^2 , [ qtrack]where the dressed hubble parameter is given by = ^-1=-=-^-1 .",
    "[ 42]at early times when @xmath24 the dressed and bare deceleration parameter both take the einstein  de sitter value @xmath25 .",
    "however , unlike the bare parameter which monotonically decreases to zero , the dressed parameter becomes negative when @xmath26 and @xmath27 at late times .",
    "for the best - fit parameters @xcite the apparent acceleration begins at a redshift @xmath28 .",
    "cosmic acceleration is thus revealed as an apparent effect which arises due to the cumulative clock rate variance of wall observers relative to volume  average observers .",
    "it becomes significant only when the voids begin to dominate the universe by volume .",
    "since the epoch of onset of apparent acceleration is directly related to the void fraction , @xmath29 , this solves one cosmic coincidence problem .",
    "in addition to apparent cosmic acceleration , a second important apparent effect will arise if one considers scales below that of statistical homogeneity . by any one set of clocks it will appear that voids expand faster than wall regions .",
    "thus a wall observer will see galaxies on the far side of a dominant void of diameter @xmath30 mpc recede at a rate greater than the dressed global average @xmath31 , while galaxies within an ideal wall will recede at a rate less than @xmath31 . since the uniform bare rate @xmath32 would also be the local value within an ideal wall , eq.([42 ] ) gives a measure of the variance in the apparent hubble flow .",
    "the best - fit parameters @xcite give a dressed hubble constant @xmath33 , and a bare hubble constant @xmath34 . the present epoch variance is 1722% .",
    "since voids dominate the universe by volume at the present epoch , any observer in a galaxy in a typical wall region will measure locally higher values of the hubble constant , with peak values of order @xmath35 at the @xmath30 mpc scale of the dominant voids . over larger distances , as the line of sight intersects more walls as well as voids , a radial spherically symmetric average will give an average hubble constant whose value decreases from the maximum at the @xmath30 mpc scale to the dressed global average value , as the scale of homogeneity is approached at roughly the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) scale of @xmath36mpc .",
    "this predicted effect could account for the hubble bubble @xcite and more detailed studies of the scale dependence of the local hubble flow @xcite .",
    "in fact , the variance of the local hubble flow below the scale of homogeneity should correlate strongly to observed structures in a manner which has no equivalent prediction in flrw models .",
    "there are two types of potential cosmological tests that can be developed ; those relating to scales below that of statistical homogeneity as discussed above , and those that relate to averages on our past light cone on scales much greater than the scale of statistical homogeneity .",
    "the second class of tests includes equivalents to all the standard cosmological tests of the standard flrw model with newtonian perturbations .",
    "this second class of tests can be further divided into tests which just deal with the bulk cosmological averages ( luminosity and angular diameter distances etc ) , and those that deal with the variance from the growth of structures ( late epoch integrated sachs ",
    "wolfe effect , cosmic shear , redshift space distortions etc ) . here",
    "i will concentrate solely on the simplest tests which are directly related to luminosity and angular diameter distance measures .    in the  cosmology we have an effective dressed luminosity distance = a0(1+z),where @xmath37 , and = ^1/3 _ ^0()(1-())^1/3 ( ) .",
    "[ eq : dl]we can also define an _ effective angular diameter distance _ , @xmath38 , and an _ effective comoving distance _ , @xmath39 ,",
    "to a redshift @xmath40 in the standard fashion = d1+z=(1+z)^2.[dist ]    a direct method of comparing the distance measures with those of homogeneous models with dark energy , is to observe that for a standard spatially flat cosmology with dark energy obeying an equation of state @xmath41 , the quantity d=_0^zz , [ rflrw]does not depend on the value of the hubble constant , @xmath31 , but only directly on @xmath42 . since the best - fit values of @xmath31 are potentially different for the different scenarios , a comparison of @xmath43 curves as a function of redshift for the  model versus the  model gives a good indication of where the largest differences can be expected , independently of the value of @xmath31 .",

    "[ fig_zdot ] for the best - fit  model with @xmath44 , where it is compared to the equivalent function for three different spatially flat  models .",
    "what is notable is that the curve for the  model is considerably flatter than those of the  models .",
    "this may be understood to arise from the fact that the magnitude of the apparent acceleration is considerably smaller in the  model , as compared to the magnitude of the acceleration in  models . for models",
    "in which there is no apparent acceleration whatsoever , one finds that @xmath132 is always negative .",
    "if there is cosmic acceleration , real or apparent , at late epochs then @xmath132 will become positive at low redshifts , though at a somewhat larger redshift than that at which acceleration is deemed to have begun .     for the  model with @xmath44 ( solid line )",
    "is compared to @xmath132 for three spatially flat  models with the same values of @xmath59 as in fig .",
    "[ fig_cod ] ( dashed lines).,width=211 ]    fig .",
    "[ fig_zdot ] demonstrates that a very clear signal of differences in the redshift time drift between the  model and  models might be determined at low redshifts when @xmath132 should be positive . in particular",
    ", the magnitude of @xmath132 is considerably smaller for the  model as compared to  models .",
    "observationally , however , it is expected that measurements will be best determined for sources in the lyman @xmath130 forest in the range , @xmath131 . at such redshifts",
    "the magnitude of the drift is somewhat more pronounced in the case of the  models . for a source at @xmath133 , over a period of @xmath134 years",
    "we would have @xmath135 for the  model with @xmath44 and @xmath136 . by comparison , for a spatially flat  model with @xmath137 a source at @xmath133",
    "would over ten years give @xmath138 for @xmath139 , and @xmath140 for @xmath141 .",
    "the tests outlined here demonstrate several lines of investigation to distinguish the  model from models of homogeneous dark energy .",
    "the ( in)homogeneity test of bassett , clarkson and lu is definitive , since it tests the validity of the friedmann equation directly .    in performing these tests , however",
    ", one must be very careful to ensure that data has not been reduced with built  in assumptions that use the friedmann equation .",
    "for example , current estimates of the bao scale such as that of percival  @xcite do not determine @xmath108 directly from redshift and angular diameter measures , but first perform a fourier space transformation to a power spectrum , assuming a flrw cosmology .",
    "redoing such analyses for the  model may involve a recalibration of relevant transfer functions .    in the case of supernovae , one must also take care as compilations such as the union @xcite and constitution @xcite datasets use the salt method to calibrate light curves . in this approach empirical light curve parameters and cosmological parameters  _ assuming the friedmann equation _",
    " are simultaneously fit by analytic marginalisation before the raw apparent magnitudes are recalibrated . as hicken",
    "discuss @xcite , a number of systematic discrepancies exist between data reduced by the salt , salt2 , mlcs31 and mlcs17 techniques even within the  model . in the case of the  model",
    ", we find considerable differences between the different approaches @xcite . in principle",
    ", at present there appear to be enough supernovae to decide between the and  models on bayesian evidence , but one is led to different conclusions depending on how the data is reduced .",
    "it is therefore important that the systematic issues are unravelled .",
    "the value of the dressed hubble constant is also an observable quantity of considerable interest .",
    "a recent determination of @xmath31 by riess @xcite poses a challenge for the  model .",
    "however , it is a feature of the  model that a 1722% variance in the apparent hubble flow will exist on local scales below the scale of statistical homogeneity , and this may potentially complicate calibration of the cosmic distance ladder .",
    "further quantification of the variance in the apparent hubble flow in relationship to local cosmic structures would provide an interesting possibility for tests of the  cosmology for which there are no counterparts in the standard cosmology .",
