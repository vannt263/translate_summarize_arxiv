    "in 10  20% of optically - selected quasars , broad absorption lines ( bals ) are seen in the blue wings of the uv resonance emission lines ( e.g. civ ) , due to gas with outflow velocities up to @xmath19 0.2 c ( hewett & foltz 2003 ) .",
    "the absorption troughs can be highly structured , but are smooth compared with thermal line widths .",
    "@xmath19 20% of bals are detached from the corresponding emission line by several thousand kms@xmath1 ( see korista et al 1993 for examples ) .",
    "the blue and red edges of the bal absorption trough are often relatively abrupt , spanning @xmath19 100s kms@xmath1 .",
    "these distinctive features would be hard to reconcile with absorption by individual clouds , but are consistent with the line of sight to a bal quasar intersecting an outflow which is not entirely radial , e.g. an outflow which initially emerges perpendicular to the accretion disk , and is then accelerated radially ( murray et al 1995 , elvis 2000 ) .",
    "nv bals often absorb part of the ly@xmath20 emission line , so the bal region must typically lie outside at least some of the broad emission - line region ( blr ) , i.e. @xmath21 0.1 pc from the quasar nucleus .",
    "bals are generally saturated ( optical depth @xmath19 few ) but non - black , implying partial covering of the nuclear regions ( or infilling of the absorption troughs by scattered light ) .",
    "this means that column densities can not be measured directly from apparent absorption depths ( in the past this has led to incorrect inference of super - solar metallicities ) .",
    "formally , a bal quasar is one with balnicity index ( @xmath22 , weymann et al 1991 ) greater than zero .",
    "@xmath22 is defined as the equivalent width of the civ absorption , integrated over any contiguous region of the spectrum 3000 - 25000 kms@xmath1 blueward of the quasar velocity , spanning at least 2000 kms@xmath1 , with continuum intensity @xmath23 0.9 that of the assumed unabsorbed continuum .",
    "shallower bal - like features are seen in a larger fraction of quasars ( reichard et al 2004 ) , suggesting that many quasars have similar outflows .",
    "absorbers similar to quasar bals are seen in seyfert 1 galaxies , albeit with lower outflow velocities , typically @xmath23 few hundred kms@xmath1 ( see contributions in crenshaw , kraemer & george 2002 ) .",
    "the most prominent bals are due to high - ionisation species , particularly li - like ions with one electron in the outer orbit : civ 1549  , siiv 1400  , nv 1240  .",
    "quasars whose absorption is dominated by these are known as high - ionisation bals ( hibals ) .",
    "@xmath19 15% of bal quasars also show absorption by lower - ionisation species , such as mgii 2798   and aliii 1858  , and are known as lobals .",
    "felobals are a small subset of the lobals showing absorption by feii and feiii .    with few exceptions , no changes have been observed in the velocity structure of bals on timescales @xmath19 10 years .",
    "the intensity of the absorption does vary , probably due to changes in covering factor , which suggests that the absorbers are intrinsic to the quasar .",
    "bal quasars are typically weak in soft x - rays , probably because the x - ray emission is absorbed .",
    "the relationship between uv and x - ray absorbers was discussed by blustin et al ( 2004 ) .",
    "several useful catalogues of bal quasars exist .",
    "korista et al ( 1993 ) presented a sample of 72 civ bals .",
    "becker et al ( 2000 , 2001 ) found 43 bals in 3300 deg@xmath24 of the first bright quasar survey ( @xmath25 1 mjy ) .",
    "large samples of quasars are now becoming available from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , york et al 2000 ) .",
    "reichard et al ( 2003a ) found 224 bal quasars in the sdss early data release quasar catalogue .",
    "this sample includes the 116 bals found by tolea , krolik & tsvetanov ( 2002 ) , and it overlaps with that of menou et al ( 2001 ) , who sought identifications of sdss quasars with first sources in 290 deg@xmath24 ( 14 radio bals ) .",
    "a catalogue of 23 unusual bals found in sdss ( mainly lobals ) was presented by hall et al ( 2002 ) .",
    "hypotheses about the nature of bal quasars differ mainly in the emphasis placed on the role of orientation . on the one hand",
    ", bals may be present in all quasars but are intercepted by only @xmath19 10  20% of the lines of sight to the quasar , e.g. lines of sight skimming the edge of the accretion disk or torus ( weymann et al 1991 , elvis 2000 ) .",
    "alternatively , bals may arise in a physically distinct population of quasars , e.g. newborn quasars shedding their cocoons of gas and dust , or quasars with unusually massive black holes , or with unusually high accretion rates ( briggs , turnshek & wolfe 1984 , boroson & meyers 1992 ) . amongst optically - selected quasars ,",
    "evidence has accumulated to favour the orientation hypothesis .",
    "e.g. in most respects , apart from the bal itself , bal quasars appear similar to normal quasars ( weymann et al 1991 ) .",
    "the small differences from non - bal quasars , e.g. slightly redder continua ( reichard et al 2003b ) , and higher polarisation , could also be a consequence of a preferred viewing angle .",
    "the sub - mm properties of bals are similar to those of non - bals ( willott , rawlings & grimes 2003 , lewis , chapman & kuncic 2003 ) , implying similar dust properties .",
    "this is consistent with the orientation hypothesis , but difficult to reconcile with bal quasars being an evolutionary stage associated with a large dust mass .    until recently",
    ", very few radio - loud bal quasars were known .",
    "this changed with the advent of the first bright quasar survey ( fbqs , becker et al 2001 ) , but few bals are known with log @xmath26 2 ( radio - loudness @xmath9 = @xmath27 , stocke et al 1992 ) .",
    "becker et al ( 2001 ) estimated that bals are four times less common amongst quasars with log @xmath26 2 than amongst quasars with log @xmath28 1 .",
    "hewett & foltz ( 2003 ) note that optically - bright bal quasars are half as likely as non - bals to have @xmath25 1 mjy .",
    "the dependence of bal fraction on @xmath9 may reflect the higher ratio of x - ray to uv luminosity in radio - louder objects , which could over - ionise the gas , reducing the velocity to which line - driven winds can be accelerated ( murray et al 1995 ) .",
    "becker et al ( 2000 ) found that radio - selected bal quasars have a range of spectral indices , which suggests a wide range of orientations , contrary to the favoured interpretation for optically - selected quasars .",
    "radio - loud bals tend to be compact in the radio , similar to gps ( ghz - peaked spectrum ) or css ( compact steep - spectrum ) sources , and gps / css sources are thought to be the young counterparts of powerful large - scale radio sources ( odea 1998 ) .",
    "this supports the alternative hypothesis that bals represent an early phase in the life of quasars ( gregg et al 2000 ) .    in boroson s ( 2002 )",
    "scheme for the classification of agn , based on a principal - component analysis of agn properties , the different observed types correspond to different combinations of @xmath29 ( luminosity as a fraction of eddington luminosity ) and @xmath30 ( the accretion rate ) .",
    "bal quasars occupy one corner of this space , with @xmath31 1 , similar to narrow - line sy1 galaxies , but with a much higher accretion rate .",
    "the bal quasar accretion rates are similar to those of radio - loud quasars , but with larger @xmath29 ( and lower - mass black holes ) . in boroson",
    "s scheme , the rare radio - loud bal quasars may be objects with extremely high accretion rates .",
    "lamy & hutsemekers ( 2004 ) carried out a principal - component analysis of 139 bal quasars with good - quality spectra and/or polarisation measurements .",
    "they found that most of the variation is contained in two principal components .",
    "the first is dominated by a correlation between @xmath22 and the strength of the feii emission , and may be driven by the accretion rate .",
    "the second is due to the fact that bals with pcyg profiles ( i.e. absorption just blueward of the emission line ) , are more polarised than those with detached bals .",
    "detachment is thought to correlate with orientation , with the more detached bals being seen if the angle of the line of sight to the disk is larger .",
    "hewett & foltz ( 2003 ) found no evidence that the fraction of quasars with bals varies with redshift for @xmath32 3 .",
    "however , at higher redshift , the fraction may rise .",
    "maiolino et al ( 2004 ) recently found that of 8 @xmath33 4.9 quasars observed , 4 showed strong bals , with 2 of these having unusually high balnicity index , and two being lobals ( which are rare at low redshift ) .",
    "these results suggest that bals are more common at high redshift , perhaps because of a higher accretion rate , which might affect the solid angle subtended at the quasar by the bal flow , and thus the fraction of quasars observed to have bals .    in short ,",
    "the role of orientation in bals is still not clear , and it s likely that detailed measurements of physical conditions within the outflows are required to make further progress .",
    "studies of bal outflows are also important : ( 1 ) for understanding accretion in agn , where the inflow ( fuelling ) and outflow rates may be related through the need to shed angular momentum ; ( 2 ) as probes of chemical enrichment in the central regions of agn ; ( 3 ) because the outflowing gas may contribute significantly to the metallicity of the igm ; ( 4 ) because the outflows may affect the subsequent evolution of the host galaxy ( silk & rees 1998 , fabian 1999 ) ; and ( 5 ) because the physics of the outflowing gas is not understood .",
    "no self - consistent physical model yet exists for the acceleration of the gas , or , if the filling factor is small ( many small clouds ) , for its confinement .",
    "possible mechanisms for the acceleration include radiation pressure , pressure from cosmic rays or centrifugally - driven magnetic disk winds ( de kool 1997 ) .",
    "one possible signature of radiation pressure is absorption - absorption line - locking , and this has been observed in a few quasars ( see section 3.2.2 ) .",
    "the blending of saturated features in bals precludes measurement of the column densities , which are required to constrain the ionisation balance , the distance of the absorber from the quasar and the physics involved in accelerating the outflows .",
    "however , some quasars show additional narrow absorption lines ( nals ) with velocity widths small enough ( fwhm @xmath10 300 km / s ) that multiplets of individual ions can be resolved , allowing the covering factor and true optical depth to be determined independently ( arav et al 1999 ) .",
    "some nals are intrinsic to the quasar ( aals , associated absorption lines , see e.g. wise at al 2004 ) and may be related to the bal phenomenon .",
    "intermediate in fwhm are the rarer ( @xmath19 1% of quasars , hamann & sabra 2004 ) mini - bals , fwhm @xmath10 2000 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the partial covering , variability and smooth absorption troughs indicate that mini - bals are intrinsic outflows like those seen in bals , but with the advantage that in some cases the covering factor and optical depth can be measured as a function of velocity .",
    "mini - bals are thus particularly useful for constraining physical conditions in the outflow .    using mostly the hst ,",
    "keck and vlt , high - resolution spectra of several intrinsic nal and mini - bal absorbers have been obtained , including those in quasars ( full names abbreviated ) 0011 + 0055 ( hutsemkers , hall & brinkmann 2004 ) , 0300 + 0048 ( hall et al 2003 ) , 0449 - 13 ( barlow et al 1997 ) , 08279 + 5255 ( srianand et al 2000 ) , 0946 + 301 ( arav et al 2001 ) , 1037 - 2703 ( srianand et al 2001 ) , 1044 + 3656 ( dekool et al 2001 ) , 1230 + 0115 ( ganguly et al 2003 ) , 1303 + 308 ( foltz et al 1987 , vilkoviskij & irwin 2001 ) , 1415 + 3408 ( churchill et al 1999 ) , 1511 + 091 ( srianand et al 2002 ) , 1603 + 3002 ( arav et al 1999 ) , 1605 - 0112 ( gupta et al 2003 ) , 2233 - 606 ( petitjean et al 1999 ) , 2302 + 029 ( jannuzi et al 1996 ) , um675 ( hamann et al 1997 ) , in 6 quasars studied by dodorico et al ( 2004 ) , and in the sy1 galaxy ngc 5548 ( arav et al 2002 ) .",
    "the earlier of these papers established the intrinsic nature of the absorbers , and showed the importance , when measuring column densities , of taking into account saturation and the limited covering factor .",
    "these analyses also implied that the absorbers lie close to the quasar nucleus ( although there are few actual measurements of distance ) , and might in some cases be identified with the x - ray warm absorbers .",
    "some of the quasars ( 0449 - 13 , 0946 + 301 , 1037 - 2703 , 1303 + 308 ) show changes with time of covering factor . only 1303 + 308 has shown any change in _ velocity _ ( 55 kms@xmath1 increase in velocity over 5 rest - frame years ) . in some ( 0011 + 0055 , 08279 + 5255 , 2233 - 606 )",

    "the frequency of lobals amongst radio bal quasars appears to be higher @xmath19 30% ( becker et al 2000 , 2001 , menou et al 2001 ) , than amongst non - radio bal quasars , @xmath19 15% .",
    "regardless of whether the quasar is a hibal or a lobal , the feii uv191 triplet emission line at 1787 (and feiii at 1896/1914  ) is unusually strong ( section 3.1 ) .",
    "the association of unusually high radio luminosity ( section 1.2 ) and unusually strong feii emission suggests a connection between the two .",
    "such a connection is also suggested by the fact that the 1787-  line is detectable in only 1 out of 40 sdss bal quasars with no first counterparts , but in 4 out of 14 of the sdss bal quasars with @xmath25 1 mjy ( section 3.1 ) .",
    "boroson ( 2002 ) and lamy & hutsemekers ( 2004 ) note that strong feii emission might be a signature of the thickening of the accretion disk at accretion rates close to the eddington limit , @xmath78 1 .",
    "although the intensity of this ` small blue bump ' feii emission might not always be proportional to that of the feii 1787   line ( vestergaard & wilkes 2001 ) , it s plausible that the unusually strong feii 1787-  emission in 1624 + 3758 is related to the very high accretion rates posited for radio bal quasars ( boroson 2002 ) .",
    "the detachment of the bal by 21000 kms@xmath1 from the civ emission line is moderately unusual , being observed in @xmath19 10% of bal quasars with either @xmath32 3 or @xmath33 3 .",
    "it suggests an angle of view well away from the plane of the accretion disk , so that the line of sight to the quasar nucleus exits the curving streamlines far above the disk ( see fig .",
    "8 of lamy & hutsemekers 2004 )",
    ".    the radio rotation measure of 1624 + 3758 is the second - largest known .",
    "it is due to the properties of gas lying between us and the radio - emitting region ( size @xmath79 1 kpc ) , and is unlikely to depend strongly on orientation .",
    "it implies a high value of at least one of the magnetic field , electron density or path length through the region responsible .    in summary ,",
    "the observed properties of the quasar are more consistent with it being intrinsically unusual than with it being viewed at an unusual orientation .",
    "1624 + 3758 is highly radio - luminous , and it may be a good example of an object which is accreting both at a very high rate ( high @xmath30 ) and near the eddington limit .",
    "we report high - resolution spectroscopy and radio observations of the bal quasar 1624 + 3758 , @xmath0 = 3.377 .",
    "1624 + 3758 is the most radio - luminous bal quasar known , @xmath4 = 4.3@xmath510@xmath6 whz@xmath1 .",
    "it is also highly luminous in the optical , @xmath43(1450- ) @xmath44 -27.6 , luminosity @xmath80 @xmath19 5@xmath510@xmath46 whz@xmath1 .",
    "\\(2 ) the bal has balnicity index @xmath22 = 2990 kms@xmath1 , outflow velocity -21000  -29000 kms@xmath1 .",
    "the large detachment velocity suggests an angle of view well away from the plane of the accretion disk .",
    "\\(3 ) a complex mini - bal is detected in civ , nv and ovi , with velocity -2200 ",
    "-3400 kms@xmath1 . for civ",
    ", we have measured the covering factor and optical depth as a function of velocity -2300 ",
    "-2700 kms@xmath1 .",
    "the shape of the absorption is dominated by the variation with velocity of covering factor .",
    "this variation implies that the mini - bal is intrinsic to the quasar .",
    "\\(4 ) there is statistical evidence of line - locking between 2 ( and perhaps 3 ) of the mini - bal absorption components , supporting the hypothesis that the outflows are accelerated by radiation pressure .",
    "( 5 ) a possible non - black hi absorber is observed with velocity -1870 kms@xmath1 , @xmath15(hi ) = 4 @xmath5 10@xmath16 cm@xmath3 ( lls ) .",
    "there are no associated metal lines .",
    "the covering factor is only 0.7 , suggesting that the absorber is intrinsic to the quasar , perhaps covering the continuum source , but not the broad - line region .",
    "\\(6 ) the velocities relative to the quasar of two of the civ nals are small ( -824 , 206 kms@xmath1 ) .",
    "they are likely to be intrinsic .",
    "the other 7 nals ( @xmath73 -5000 kms@xmath1 ) are probably intervening systems .",
    "the number density of civ absorbers with @xmath73 -5000 kms@xmath1 , and rest - frame equivalent width @xmath77 0.15  , is @xmath74 = 4.3 @xmath75 2 , consistent with that measured for other quasars .",
    "\\(7 ) the wings of the civ and nv emission lines are markedly asymmetric , consistent with the red wings being suppressed , perhaps due to dust extinction of light emitted by gas outflows on the far side of the nucleus .",
    "\\(11 ) the conjunction of several unusual features , particularly the strong feii 1787-  emission , and the high radio rotation measure , favour the quasar being intrinsically unusual rather than being viewed at an unusual orientation . given the high radio luminosity , the unusual features may be due to a combination of a very high accretion rate and high @xmath29 , i.e. this quasar may occupy an extreme position in boroson s ( 2002 ) classification scheme for agn .",
