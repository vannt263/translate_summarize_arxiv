    "the recent discovery of the higgs boson at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) was a major milestone not just in particle physics but in the history of science .",
    "it bears the knowledge how the mass comes about at quantum level by the higgs mechanism . with the higgs boson discovery ,",
    "particle physics entered a new era of tremendous intensity of detailed and careful study of its properties .",
    "hopefully , accurate understanding of the higgs phenomenology together with new information from experiments at the lhc will provide us a tool for exploring new physics .",
    "+ great interest is currently devoted to the study of the higgs boson couplings to the electroweak gauge bosons @xmath0 and @xmath1 and to the top- and bottom - quarks or tau - leptons .",
    "deviations in these couplings could possibly be observed once the currently large uncertainties will be improved as part of the lhc program and at a future higgs factory .",
    "it has been shown that the higgs couplings will be sensitive to new physics at the multi - tev scale once percent level precision on coupling measurements will be achieved ( for a recent review see @xcite ) .    the aim of this paper is to propose a method for the computation of the top - yukawa coupling within the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) taking into account radiative corrections at @xmath2 accuracy . in general , the relationships between the running couplings and the physical observables like particle masses are affected by large radiative corrections  @xcite . within the sm ,",
    "the relationship between the running top - yukawa coupling and the physical top - quark pole mass receives three type of radiative corrections : i ) higher order corrections to the running yukawa coupling , ii ) contribution to the fermion pole mass , and iii ) corrections to the relation between the fermi constant and the sm parameters .",
    "the first contribution is known at three - loop accuracy  @xcite taking into account corrections from all sectors of the sm .",
    "the radiative corrections to the top - quark pole mass are known in qcd up to three - loop order  @xcite and in the electroweak sector up to two loops  @xcite .",
    "the third contribution is known in the sm with two- and three - loop accuracy for the genuine electroweak  @xcite and mixed qcd - electroweak  @xcite sectors , respectively .",
    "as was explicitly shown there are two sources for the large radiative corrections : the pure qcd contributions to the top - quark pole mass of about @xmath3  gev , @xmath4  gev and @xmath5  gev  @xcite at one- , two- and three - loop order , respectively ; and the tadpole diagrams when they are taken into account for a gauge - independent definition of the running - mass  @xcite .",
    "their magnitude is comparable with that from qcd sector at the one - loop order and amounts to about @xmath5  gev at two loops .",
    "as can be concluded from the numerical values cited above the radiative corrections are very important for the qcd sector , and even the third - order terms in the perturbative series are necessary in order to cope with the current experimental accuracy on the top - quark mass  @xcite .",
    "however , the situation is going to change if the international linear collider ( ilc ) is built , where a precision of @xmath6  mev is expected .",
    "+ when physics beyond the sm is considered , the radiative corrections to the top - quark pole mass might receive much larger contributions than in the sm and even diagrams beyond the three - loop order have to be taken into account to reach the current experimental accuracy . by now ,",
    "the radiative corrections to the fermion pole mass are known at two - loop order for a general theory with massless gauge bosons  @xcite .",
    "the numerical evaluation of the two - loop self - energy diagrams has been implemented in the code tsil  @xcite . for supersymmetric models with masses at the few tev scale   the radiative corrections to the top - quark pole mass increase by about a factor of four as compared to the sm results as we show in section  [ sec : numerics ] .",
    "thus , the two - loop contributions might become one order of magnitude larger than the experimental uncertainties and the effects of higher order corrections have to be considered .",
    "the computation of on - shell self - energy diagrams with several mass scales at the three - loop order is , for the time being , feasible only using asymptotic expansion techniques and is computationally very involved . in this paper",
    ", we propose an alternative method that can be applied as long as the top - quark mass is much smaller than the masses of supersymmetric particles . in the present paper , we focus on the dominant susy - qcd corrections to the running yukawa coupling in the mssm and postpone the study of the contributions originating from yukawa and electroweak interactions for a later publication .",
    "the susy - qcd corrections to the relation between the running yukawa coupling and the top - quark pole mass reduce to the corrections to the ratio between the pole and the running masses .",
    "explicitly , the running top - quark mass is determined in the sm with the highest available precision from the experimentally measured pole mass  .",
    "then , the running mass is evolved up to the susy scale using the renormalization group equations ( rges ) of the sm .",
    "afterwards , the running top - quark mass in the sm is converted to its value in the mssm . in this step ,",
    "threshold corrections at the susy - scale are required . in the last step ,",
    "the running top - quark mass in the mssm is evolved at the desired energy scale with the help of mssm rges .",
    "as the rges in the sm  @xcite and the mssm  @xcite are known to three - loop order , the threshold corrections are required at the two - loop order .",
    "they are known for light quark masses ( e.g. bottom quark ) in the sm to three - loop accuracy  @xcite and in the mssm to two loops  @xcite .",
    "great interest was devoted to the determination of the effective bottom - yukawa coupling in susy - models with a large @xmath7 parameter  @xcite .",
    "for these models the resummation of @xmath7 enhanced contributions is considered on top of the two - loop order calculation .",
    "one goal of this paper is to present the computation of the two - loop susy - qcd threshold corrections to the running top - quark mass .",
    "the calculation is similar with the ones performed in  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the method presented here as compared to the direct calculation of on - shell self - energy diagrams in the mssm is that the occurring large logarithms of the form @xmath8 are automatically resummed by the use of rges .",
    "the result is a much better convergence of the perturbative series as will be explicitly shown in the next sections .",
    "+ the second aim is to study the phenomenological effects of the above calculation .",
    "obviously , the top - yukawa coupling is an essential ingredient in all processes involving interactions between the higgs boson and top - quark and top - squarks .",
    "however , the most prominent example is probably the effects on the lightest higgs boson mass , that receives radiative corrections enhanced by the fourth power in top - yukawa coupling .",
    "a detailed numerical analysis of the effects of the proposed method for the determination of the running yukawa coupling on the susy - qcd corrections to the lightest higgs boson mass will be discussed in section  [ sect : mhphen ] .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section  [ sec : frm ] we present our computational framework ; explicit analytical results are discussed in section  [ sec : res ] together with their numerical implementation ; in section  [ sect : mhphen ] we perform a phenomenological analysis of the effects of the two - loop susy - qcd corrections determined in the previous section on the susy - qcd prediction of the lightest higgs boson mass with three - loop accuracy ; in section  [ sec : concl ] we summarise our conclusions .",
    "an elegant approach to get rid of unwanted large logarithms occurring in the predictions for observables in multi - scale processes is to formulate an effective theory ( et ) ( for a review see ref .",
    "the parameters of the et must be modified in order to take into account the effects of the heavy fields .",
    "the et parameters are related to the parameters of the full theory by the so - called matching or decoupling relations .",
    "these take into account threshold corrections generated by the heavy degrees of freedom that are integrated out when the et is constructed . in the following ,",
    "we concentrate on the calculation of the decoupling coefficients for the strong coupling and the top - quark mass within susy - qcd .",
    "they are defined through the following relations between the bare quantities + @xmath9 where the primes label the quantities in the effective theory .",
    "the decoupling coefficients have been computed in qcd including corrections up to the four - loop order for the strong coupling  @xcite and three - loop order for quark masses  @xcite . in the mssm the two - loop susy - qcd  @xcite and susy - ew  @xcite",
