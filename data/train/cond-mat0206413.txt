    "it has become clear @xcite that neutral ( @xmath11 ) and charged ( @xmath8 ) excitons both play an important role in the photoluminescence ( pl ) spectrum of realistic quantum hall systems at high magnetic field and low electron density ( i.e. for filling factor @xmath12 ) .",
    "this is true despite the `` hidden symmetry '' of the ideal theoretical model ( `` itm '' implies zero well width , @xmath13 , and very high magnetic field , @xmath14 ; impurity scattering will be ignored in all our calculations ) which suggests that pl occurs only from neutral exciton recombination @xcite . at values of @xmath1 close to unity a considerable body of experimental data exists @xcite , but no simple picture of the pl process has emerged . in this note",
    "we suggest that positively charged excitonic complexes ( @xmath5 ) consisting of @xmath2 spin waves ( sw ) , each with angular momentum @xmath15 , bound to a valence hole ( @xmath16 ) must occur for @xmath17 , and that in real experimental systems at low temperature these @xmath5 complexes could dominate the pl spectrum .",
    "a sw consists of a reversed - spin - electron  spin - hole pair ( @xmath18 ) in the lowest landau level ( ll ) of the conduction band .    throughout this paper",
    "we contrast the predictions of the itm with those of realistic systems .",
    "the latter requires the admixture of a number of ll s by the coulomb interaction and taking into account the finite well width @xmath13 .",
    "finite separation @xmath19 between the electron layer and the valence hole layer can also be included .",
    "these effects destroy the `` hidden symmetry '' which occurs when the magnitude @xmath20 of the coulomb interaction is the same for any pair ( @xmath21 ) selected from ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath16 ) .",
    "the paper is organized in three main sections .",
    "section 2 contains a summary of the results predicted @xcite for pl in dilute systems ( @xmath24 . section 3 section contains a discussion of the elementary spin excitations @xcite of a system of @xmath25 electrons with @xmath1 close to unity in the absence of any valence band holes . in section 4 a valence hole",

    "the appropriate electron zeeman splitting has been included , and only the lowest state of each triplet is shown . to achieve even qualitative agreement with experimental data",
    ", it has also been necessary to include a number of higher ll s , particularly at the lower magnetic fields .",
    "five ll s were needed to obtain convergence in our calculations . in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a , at the high magnetic field of 68  t , the @xmath41 at @xmath42 is still the ground state , but singlet and another triplet bound states occur at other values of @xmath31 ( the singlet @xmath45 at @xmath46 and the bright triplet @xmath41 at @xmath40 have roughly half the binding energy of the @xmath41 ) . at @xmath47  t , as shown in fig .",

    "@xcite and @xcite , respectively . for the values of the parameters used in our calculations , the singlet and triplet ground states cross at a value of @xmath14 of the order of 30  t. this is in agreement with the calculations of whittaker and shields @xcite who used a different numerical approach .",
    "because exact diagonalization gives the eigenfunctions as well as the eigenvalues , it is straightforward to evaluate matrix elements of the luminescence operator @xmath53 between an initial state @xmath54 of @xmath25 electrons and one valence hole , and final states @xmath55 containing @xmath56 electrons . @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the annihilation operators for an electron and valence hole respectively .",

    "the @xmath45 and @xmath63 have finite oscillator strengths which are of the same order of magnitude .    when additional electrons are present ( @xmath64 ) radiative decay of the @xmath41 is not strictly forbidden , since in the recombination process an unbound electron can scatter , changing the momentum of the final state .",
    "however , it was found that for @xmath12 such decays are weak because laughlin correlations of the @xmath8 with unbound electrons inhibit close collisions .",
    "the amplitude for radiative decay of the @xmath41 is estimated @xcite to be smaller by one or more orders of magnitude than those of the @xmath45 and @xmath63 .",

    "is increased , the number of spin flips , @xmath2 , in the lowest energy state decreases until at @xmath96 only the spin hole in the @xmath0 state remains .",
    "the state with the integral value of @xmath2 ( closest to @xmath93 ) which gives the lowest energy is a measure of the size of the antiskyrmion , the state consisting of @xmath2 swss bound to a spin hole in the @xmath0 state @xcite . by electron ",
    "hole symmetry the state containing one reversed spin electron , @xmath22 , in addition to the filled @xmath0 level will form an analogous skyrmion state consisting of @xmath2 swss bound to the original @xmath22 .",

    "@xcite , the inclusion of the admixture of higher ll s caused by the coulomb interaction weakly affects the skyrmion energy spectrum , particularly when the finite wel width @xmath13 is also taken into account .",
    "the skyrmion and antiskyrmion states @xmath98 are quite analogous to the excitonic @xmath99 states of valence band holes interacting with conduction band electrons .",
    "in the itm , a valence hole has exactly the same interactions as a spin hole in the @xmath0 state of the conduction band .",
    "in fact these two types of holes can probably be distinguished by an isospin as is done for electrons on different layers of a bilayer system @xcite . the spectrum and possible condensed states of a multicomponent fermion liquid containing electrons , @xmath100 , @xmath101 ,  , etc .",
    ", has been considered by wjs _",
    "exactly the same ideas are applicable to a liquid of electrons and skyrmions or antiskyrmions of different sizes .",
    "the only difference is that the skyrmion @xmath102 is stable while the @xmath103 has a finite lifetime for radiative recombination of an electron  valence - hole pair .",
    "when there are @xmath104 spin holes in the @xmath0 level ( or @xmath105 reversed spin electrons in addition to the filled @xmath0 level ) and when @xmath104 ( or @xmath105 ) is much smaller than @xmath106 , the degeneracy of the filled lowest ll , then the most stable configuration will consist of @xmath104 antiskyrmions ( or @xmath105 skyrmions ) of the most stable size .",
    "these antiskyrmions ( or skyrmions ) repel one another .",
    "they are positively ( or negatively ) charged fermions with standard ll structure , so it is not surprising that they would form either a wigner lattice or a laughlin condensed state with @xmath1 for the antiskyrmion ( or skyrmion ) equal to an odd denominator fraction as discussed in refs .",
    "in the itm , a valence hole acts exactly like a spin hole in the @xmath0 level of the conduction band .",
    "therefore we would expect an excitonic complex consisting of @xmath2 sw s bound to the valence hole to be the lowest energy state , in the same way that the antiskyrmion consisting of @xmath2 sw s bound to a spin hole in the @xmath0 level gives the lowest energy state when @xmath67 is less than @xmath107 .",
    "for a small number of valence holes , the @xmath108 excitonic complexes formed by each valence hole will repel one another . if a small number of antiskyrmions are already present ( for @xmath109 ) , the positively charged antiskyrmion  charged - exciton repulsion will lead to laughlin correlations or wigner crystallization of the multicomponent fermion liquid .",
    "just as for the @xmath8 excitons in the dilute regime , the pl at low temperature will be dominated by the @xmath110 process , with @xmath111 or @xmath112 depending on spin of the annihilated valence hole ( i.e. on the circular polarization of the emitted photon @xmath113 ) .",
    "this corresponds to the most stable @xmath5 undergoing radiative @xmath114 or @xmath115 recombination and leaving behind an antiskyrmion consisting of @xmath2 or @xmath112 sw s bound to a spin hole of the @xmath0 state . because the valence hole and the spin hole in the @xmath0 conduction level are distinguishable ( or have different isospin ) even in the itm",
    "this pl is not forbidden .",
    "it will be very interesting to see how realistic sample effects ( finite well width , ll admixture , finite separation between the electron and valence hole layers ) alter the conclusions of the itm .    for @xmath27 , negatively charged skyrmions",
    "are present before the introduction of the valence holes .",
    "the skyrmions are attracted by the @xmath5 charge exciton , but how this interaction affects the pl can only be guessed .",
    "we are currently investigating real sample effects in systems containing a small number of skyrmions ( or antiskyrmions ) and valence band excitonic complexes .",
    "as one preliminary example we show in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the binding energy of the @xmath116 and @xmath117 complexes for different values of the total angular momentum @xmath31 as a function of the separation between the electron and valence hole layers .     at @xmath118 and @xmath82 , and of @xmath117 at @xmath119 as a function of @xmath19 , the @xmath7@xmath16 layer separation .",
    "the calculations are for a gaas quantum well of width 10  nm at a magnetic field @xmath120  t. different curves include one , two , and three ll s for the valence hole . ]",
    "the calculation was done for parameters corresponding to a gaas quantum well of width @xmath121  nm , at a magnetic field of 20  t. different symbols ( open circles , open diamonds , and solid circles ) are for calculations in which one , two , or three ll s for the valence hole have been included ( inter - ll excitations of conduction electrons are less important due to their smaller effective mass",
    ". clearly , binding energies decrease with increasing layer separation as expected .",
    "we believe that numerical diagonalization for realistic models including ll admixture and finite well width should explain the behavior of pl for electron filling factors close to unity . the qualitative behavior expected has been discussed in this note .",
