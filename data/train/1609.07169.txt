    "the materials consisting of gaas / alas have been widely used in investigation of the above heterostructures . however ,",
    "new types of the materials have been also taken into account , for example , silicon carbide ( sic ) [ 7 ] .    to study the semiconductor heterostructures within the theoretical and practical frameworks",
    "could give some clues that may be helpful to advance the semiconductor technology such as development of some optoelectronic and communication devices based on the quantum mechanical tunnelling , some visible lasers based on the electronic spectrum of double quantum well [ 8 ] and quantum cascade lasers based on the electronic transition between levels of the conduction band [ 9 ] . among the other quantum heterostructures , the triangular quantum well(s )",
    "is also important systems since the absorption coefficient value is reduced in the experimental measurement of the electroabsorption when triangular quantum wells used [ 10 ] .",
    "moreover , the current absorption spectra of the triangular quantum profile could operate with lower driving voltages [ 11 ] .",
    "the quantum mechanical tunnelling is a fundamental subject within the studying of the semiconductor quantum systems .",

    "we point out that the energy levels of the triangular quantum well is finite and the potential parameter @xmath3 controls the bound state numbers . in computation , we take the values of the mass parameters as @xmath4 for gaas where @xmath5 is the free electron mass .    in the present work , we study the transmission probability of the @xmath0 schrdinger equation for the triangular potential barrier by writing the related wave functions in terms of the airy s functions and in terms of the solutions of the kummer s differential equation , namely , the confluent hypergeometric functions of the first kind . among the approaches and methods used to study the quantum heterostructures [ 12 ] , our formalism is based on solving the schrdinger equation coming from the hamiltonian written for the case of position dependent mass [ 14 ] . in this case , the generalization of the standard hamiltonian is not trivial because the linear momentum and mass operator no longer commute .",
    "we propose a mass function depending on spatially coordinate to solve 1d effective schrdinger equation .",
    "our formalism includes also an approach meaning that we ignore the terms including the derivatives of mass in 1d effective schrdinger equation by assuming one of the mass parameters goes to zero .",
