    "globular and open clusters provide useful probes of the longterm chemical and dynamical evolution of the milky way .",
    "the globular clusters probe the formation and early evolution of the spheroidal components of the milky way while the open clusters provide a useful tool to study the evolution of the galactic disk .",
    "however , the paucity of very old ( old is here taken to mean @xmath1 years , the time scale on which an open cluster will be dissolved , spitzer 1958 ) open clusters in the disk forces us to consider the considerably more loosely arranged moving groups to probe the earlier evolution of the disk .",
    "it was olin eggen who first introduced the concept of moving or stellar kinematic groups , of which the hyades is a well known example .",
    "the basic idea behind the moving groups is that stars form in clusters and thus with similar space motion , on top of which the random motions of single stars are added , resulting in a modest velocity dispersion within the group . through the orbital motion within the galactic potential the group will be stretched out into a tube - like structure and finally , after several galactic orbits , dissolve .",
    "the result of the stretching is that the stars will appear , if the sun happens to be inside the tube , all over the sky but may be identified as a group through their common space velocity .",
    "thus the moving groups may provide the essential , and so far largely un - utilized , link between cluster and field stars .",
    "these are the assumptions , but are moving groups observable realities ?",
    "a large stumbling block for assessing the reality of moving groups has been the lack of large numbers of reliable parallaxes .",
    "this has now been largely overcome by the observations from the hipparcos satellite ( esa 1997 ) .",
    "this has , in fact , resulted in a small burst of recent papers studying , mainly young , moving groups , e.g. asiain et al .",

    "eggen defined moving groups as stars that all share the same velocity in the direction of galactic rotation , i.e. v - velocity .",
    "specifically the velocities required to be constant were corrected for the stars differing radial distance from the sun in order to make the circular orbits iso - periodic ( eggen 1998b ) . however , using the hipparcos parallaxes it is noted that firstly the groups get more compact and secondly that stars identified as group members do not form flat bars or ellipses with small @xmath2 but are in fact structures tilted in the @xmath3-plane ( skuljan et al .",
    "1 ) . part of this shape can be attributed to the errors in the parallaxes themselves and their transformation into errors in the @xmath3-plane . however , through dynamical simulations skuljan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) show that all of the tilt can not be attributed to the errors in parallaxes but also has a physical basis .    in view of these new possibilities",
    "it is now appropriate to re - asses the reality and membership criteria for the hr 1614 moving group .",
    "eggen ( 1998b ) has compared hipparcos and cluster parallaxes for stars in his sample ( eggen 1992 ) of hr 1614 moving group member stars .",

    "the three boxes 2 , 5 , and 7 all show well populated hr - diagrams . as we move from box 2 to 7 over box 5 the turn - off age of stars with solar - like metallicities increases .",
    "the canonical view of the stellar populations in the solar neighbourhood implies that we would expect subsequently more and more metal - poor stars as we move further away from the sun in velocity space .",
    "especially we would expect box 5 to be older and more metal - poor than box 2 and box 7 even older and more metal - poor as we sample more and more halo and thick disk stars and less of the disk stars .",
    "the visual impression from fig .",
    "[ hrboxes.fig ] is the presence of a a richly populated metal - rich isochrone present in box 2 and 5 but not in any other box .",
    "however the relative number of metal - rich stars appears much larger in box 5 than in box 2 .",
    "is this significant ? to find out we combine our hipparcos catalogue with strmgren photometry ( hauk & mermilliod 1998 ) and calculate [ me / h ] using the calibration in schuster & nissen ( 1989 ) .",
    "all stars flagged as possible binaries in the hipparcos catalogue were excluded .",
    "this includes both systems detected by hipparcos itself and system previously known ( e.g. from radial velocity variation ) and included in the ccdm catalogue of multiple stars ( esa 1997 ) .",

    "the resulting normalized metallicity - distributions for box 2 , 5 , and 7 are shown in fig .",

    "clearly box 7 has a large , metal - poor tail , as expected since this box should contain many halo stars as well as thick disk stars .",
    "box 2 on the other hand , which should be the most solar - like box , has almost no metal - poor tail and a distinct peak at @xmath8 dex , just what is expected for the solar neighbourhood , wyse & gilmore ( 1995 ) .",
    "box 5 on the other hand is more metal - rich than the solar neighbourhood .",
    "this does not fit into the canonical picture of the general stellar populations in the galaxy .",
    "it should be more metal - poor ( on average ) than box 2 and more metal - rich than box 7 .    the background distribution of stars in fig .",
    "[ uv.hip.fig ] shows that the maximum density occurs in several clumps rather close to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) but also that a secondary maximum exists centered on @xmath9 km  s@xmath10 , @xmath11 km  s@xmath10 ( see also dehnen 1999 , fig . 1 for a similar smoothed density distribution plot ) .",
    "this stellar population with a mostly negative u - velocity , was already tentatively identified in pre - hipparcos data and named the u - anomaly . in the hipparcos data it is much more",
    "well defined .",
    "raboud et al .",
    "( 1998 ) who obtained geneva photometry for stars in this area of the @xmath3-space , found a metallicity distribution similar to that of the bulge .",
    "supported by dynamical simulations they concluded that the stars formed in the inner disk were scattered by the bar into the solar neighborhood .",
    "these stars make up a large part of the old stars found in box 2 .",
    "figure [ uvbox25.fig ] shows the velocity distribution of stars with strmgren metallicities in box 2 and 5 .",
    "the u - anomaly is clearly seen in box 2 and found to be dominated by stars of solar metallicity and below .    from this and our previous considerations it is clear that the super - solar metallicity stars are predominantly found in box 5 , the area of the @xmath3-plane in which the hr 1614 moving group is supposed to be found .",
    "we thus conclude that there exists a distinct stellar population more metal - rich than the average background centered at @xmath12 and @xmath13 km  s@xmath10 and tilted in the @xmath3-plane .",
    "this population is not found in the adjacent areas in the @xmath3-plane .",
    "can this stellar population be identified with the moving group hr 1614 found by eggen ?",
    "to answer this question we now turn to a dynamical simulation of the evolution of old moving groups to find out whether or not the structure we observe in box 5 can indeed be identified with an old moving group .",
    "a galactic potential model consisting of a stellar and gaseous disk , thick disk , bulge and dark halo ( dehnen & binney 1998 ) is used to integrate the orbits of the individual stars in a dissolving moving group . in the model",
    "the solar distance from the galactic centre is r@xmath14 kpc , the height above the plane is z@xmath15 pc , the solar peculiar velocity components are @xmath16 km  s@xmath10 , @xmath17 km  s@xmath10 , @xmath18 km  s@xmath10 and the circular velocity @xmath19 km  s@xmath10 .",
    "the starting point for the simulation is attained by taking a velocity vector and position from a star assumed to belong to the moving group e.g. hr 1614 itself and integrate the orbit backwards for the assumed age of the moving group . at this position",
    "an ensemble of stars is placed and followed forward into the present time .",
    "the stars are treated as test particles in the static potential and the dispersion processes is modeled in two different ways .",
    "either the moving group is born unbound like an ob association with a certain velocity dispersion and no further dispersion processes are active or the group is born as a bound system like an open cluster with identical velocities and the dispersion is gradually built up by stars becoming unbound to the cluster and starting to experience orbital diffusion ( wielen 1977 ) .",
    "both methods are rather crude approximations to the real processes that affect the evolution of a dissolving moving group , but they can be seen as limiting cases to the real processes at work .",
    "our main use of the simulations is also to test the assumption that the sample of stars identified as probable members due to metallicity and kinematics have a common origin in time and space .",
    "the two examples in fig .",
    "[ sim.fig ] shows that the structure in the @xmath3-plane outlined by the metal - rich stars in fig .",
    "[ uvbox25.fig ] with a width in u - velocity of 60 km  s@xmath10 and in @xmath20 of 20 km  s@xmath10 and not confined to a single v - velocity is a natural result of the dynamically simulated dispersion processes .",
    "the classical configuration , used by eggen , with all stars belonging to the group lined up along a single v - velocity only appears when the sun is located very close to the centre of the group , which is not likely . otherwise , either if the sun is located to the outside or the inside of the tube - orbit defined by the moving group , we get the tilted structure in the @xmath3-plane shown in fig .",
    "[ sim.fig ] . in the simulation in fig .",
    "[ sim.fig]a with an original velocity dispersion of 6 km  s@xmath10 , the center of the group had a velocity of @xmath21 km  s@xmath10 , @xmath22 km  s@xmath10 and @xmath23 km  s@xmath10 when it passed the present solar position 40 myrs ago . in the simulation with wielen diffusion",
    ", we used a time and velocity independent diffusion coefficient @xmath24 km  s@xmath10 yr@xmath10 and the center of the group had a velocity of @xmath25 km  s@xmath10 , @xmath22 km  s@xmath10 and @xmath23 km  s@xmath10 when it passed the present solar position only 5 myrs ago .",
    "these two examples have their peak density in the @xmath3-plane at approximately the same position as the observed distribution found in sect . [ search.sect ] .",
    "we close the first part of our paper with a few remarks on the reality of old moving groups . before the hipparcos mission",
    "the numbers of reliable parallaxes were too small to address the reality of most proposed old moving groups successfully .",
    "recent studies ( e.g. barrado y navascus 1998 , and skuljan et al . 1997 ) have shown that well known moving groups such as the pleiades and the hyades but also several other young moving groups , e.g. castor ( @xmath26 myr , barrado y navascus 1998 ) , are well identified as physical entities using the new data from the hipparcos mission .",
    "are the proposed old moving groups a reality ?",
    "we conclude that at least one old moving group exists and that it s possible to find other ones using velocity information in combination with metallicities based on strmgren photometry .",
    "the study by dehnen ( 1998 ) further supports our findings .",
    "he recovered many maxima , using a maximum likelihood solution , in the velocity distribution of nearby stars using the hipparcos catalogue .",
    "several of these are identifiable with known moving groups .",
    "in particular he found several maxima that exclusively contained red stars , indicating an old age .",
    "he identifies one of these maxima with the hr 1614 moving group .",
    "however , hr 1614 might be a rather special case .",
    "it is particularly metal - rich compared to the majority of stars in the part of the @xmath3-plane it resides in . in other parts of the @xmath3-plane ( e.g. close to the local standard of rest ) the group would have been completely obscured by other metal - rich stars .    in summary",
    ", we conclude that at least one old moving group exists and it s possible to find others using our simple method if they stand out in terms of metallicity and/or age from the ambient background of stars in their space of the @xmath3-plane .",
    "the hr 1614 moving group stands out among stellar moving groups in terms of age and metallicity .",
    "the age and metallicity have been estimated to be roughly similar to that of the old open cluster ngc 6791 , hufnagel & smith ( 1994 ) and eggen ( 1998a ) . however ,",
    "this is challenged by the recent determination by chaboyer at al .",
    "( 1999 ) who found ngc 6791 to have a metallicity of @xmath27 dex and an age of 8 gyr .",
    "it was eggen ( 1978 ) who , following leads in earlier studies by eggen ( 1971 ) and hearnshaw ( 1974 ) , first identified the presence of a moving group associated with the k dwarf star hr 1614 ( hd 32147 ) by studying a sample of stars which were selected as being within @xmath28 km  s@xmath10 of the v - velocity of the star hr 1614 ( then estimated to @xmath29 km  s@xmath10 ) .",
    "he found that in a sample of 44 stars with @xmath30 and @xmath20 velocities in a right handed system .",
    "eggen use a left handed system , however , we conform with the now common practice and use a right handed system where u points in the direction towards the galactic centre and @xmath20 in the direction of galactic rotation . ]",
    "@xmath31 km  s@xmath10 60 % were over abundant with respect to the sun ( based on a few spectroscopic studies , mainly oinas ( 1974 ) and the @xmath32 index ) .",
    "the stars appear as metal - rich as the hyades in the @xmath33 diagram .",
    "they also showed strong blanketing effects in @xmath34 ( an excess of @xmath35 compared to the hyades group , which was utilized as a selection criterion ) and made up a colour magnitude diagram resembling that of an old stellar cluster ( eggen 1978 fig .",
    "smith ( 1983 ) subsequently obtained ddo photometry of 19 suggested member stars and found many of them to have enhanced cyanogen bands similar to those found in so called super - metal - rich stars ( smr , see taylor 1996 for a discussion of smr stars ) .",
    "the group also showed anomalously many cn - rich stars when compared with a random sample of stars .",
    "derived [ fe / h ] generally confirmed the high metallicity of the member stars , however , two giant stars were found to be significantly lower in metallicity casting some doubt on eggen s ( 1978 ) @xmath34 criterion for membership .",
    "a stricter application of membership criteria , i.e. that the stars should show the same behaviour in both ubv , ddo and @xmath34 , showed that many of eggen s original candidates did not belong to the group .",
    "smith ( 1983 ) further suggests that the abundances and kinematics of the hr 1614 moving group stars are consistent with the abundance gradient observed in old open clusters ( if it formed at perigalacticon ) and thus the lack of observations of similar clusters would be due to that either they no longer exist or that observations up to 1983 had not sampled the inner regions of the galaxy well enough . utilizing the cn - enhancement eggen ( 1992 )",
    "found a total of 39 main - sequence members of the hr 1614 moving group by isolating them through their v - velocity .",
    "all these dwarfs are within 40 pc of the sun .",
    "a further 19 red giants within 200 pc of the sun were also identified .",
    "no high resolution spectroscopic study has targeted the probable member stars of the hr 1614 moving group .",
    "we now proceed with the second part of this paper and provide a new sample of stars with high probability of being member stars . from this new sample",
    "we are able to derive an age as well as a metallicity for the moving group .",
    "is it possible to define a selection criterion in the @xmath3-plane for the moving group hr 1614 that is stricter than the boundaries of box 5 ? from fig .",
    "[ uvbox25.fig ] we find that metal - rich stars in box 5 predominantly fall along a diagonal band going from the lower left to the upper right - hand corner . in order to find out if this tilted structure is significant we select only stars with small relative errors in the parallaxes , @xmath36 , and with [ me / h]@xmath37 dex .",
    "the latter selection is based on the assumption that , if existing ( as we assume in this section ) , the hr 1614 group should have a metallicity around @xmath38 dex .",
    "for example the star hr 1614 itself has [ fe / h ] @xmath39 dex from high resolution spectroscopy ( feltzing & gustafsson 1998 ) .",
    "[ uvstr.fig]a show the @xmath3-plane for these stars with error - bars on the @xmath40 and @xmath20 velocities arising from errors in the parallaxes and radial velocities .",
    "apart from one star ( hip 87116 , which we consider as belonging to the general background and is excluded from the following discussion ) the stars tend to fall along a diagonal line .",
    "the star at the top ( @xmath41 km  s@xmath10 ) could be contamination from the u - anomaly ( see text above ) , but we leave it in the sample .",
    "a simple least square fit to these data give @xmath42 , fig .",
    "[ uvstr.fig ] a. we also show lines representing @xmath43 one rms . in fig .",
    "[ uvstr.fig ] b we show all stars in box 5 with [ fe / h ] @xmath44 dex and @xmath36 as well as all stars with @xmath45 [ fe / h ] @xmath46 dex .",
    "as can be seen all of the stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath44 dex could be regarded as falling inside this tilted band if the errors on the velocities are taken into account .",
    "this finding combined with our simulations suggests that we have identified a metal - rich co - moving stellar sample with a common origin in space and time .",
    "the simulations indicate that the structures may not only be tilted but also curved in the @xmath3-plane , however , our data set is too small to address that question and we have to be satisfied with a `` straight line '' .",
    "this selection procedure now helps us to define a new sample of probable hr 1614 moving group member stars from our strmgren catalogue , table [ newsample.tab ] .",
    "our new sample is limited by the fact that the calibration from schuster & nissen ( 1989 ) used to calculate [ me / h ] is only valid for dwarf stars with @xmath47 . because of these limitations k dwarf stars are excluded and for example hr 1614 itself is not included although it perfectly obeys our selection criteria in all other respects .",
    "however , see discussions in sect . [ sect.met ] and [ eggen.sect ] .",
    "we thus propose that future searches for member stars of the hr 1614 moving groups should be directed to the area in the @xmath3-plane defined by our tilted band .",
    "we are now in a position to determine a new age estimate of the hr 1614 moving group from the hr - diagram of stars with strmgren metallicities and based on the selection described in the previous section .",
    "thus from fig . [ hrbox5age.fig ] we derive an age estimate of 2 gyr using the bertelli et al .",

    "this discrepancy could be due to an error in the colour transformation from the @xmath49 to the @xmath50 plane where a metal - rich model atmosphere is used compared to the solar metallicity case which is much better constrained .",
    "other possible error sources are the assumed @xmath51 , where a lower value would give a lower metallicity for the isochrone and the assumed scaled solar abundances . if other elements than iron is over - abundant this would lower the iron content for the same assumed metallicity .    in an attempt to estimate an error on this age estimate",
    "we have compared the the bertelli et al .",
    "( 1994 ) isochrones with those from chaboyer et al .",
    "their metal - rich isochrones present excellent fits to observations from solar metallicity ( m67 ) to the very high metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath52 for ngc 6791 , both of which are older than the hr 1614 moving group . for solar metallicity the bertelli et al .",

    "dehnen ( 1999 ) shows that there exists an over - density of stars in the @xmath3-plane centered on @xmath82 and @xmath83 km  s@xmath10 .",

    "however , since the wolf 630 moving group has a mean [ fe / h ] of @xmath86 dex ( boesgaard & friel 1990 ) almost none of the stars would remain in our strmgren sample .",
    "schuster & nissen ( 1989 ) estimated the scatter of their calibration to 0.16 dex .",
    "when we compare the estimated metallicities with spectroscopic abundances the differences are much smaller , around 0.06 dex .",
    "thus we may expect these stars to be removed also in the strmgren sample . in the spectroscopic sample all would be removed .",
    "we conclude that the contamination of our sample by stars from the wolf 630 moving group is negligible .",
    "eggen ( 1998a ) suggested that the open cluster ngc 6791 might be part of the hr 1614 moving group .",

    "( 1995 ) and chaboyer et al .",
    "( 1999 ) which both agree that the open cluster has an age around @xmath87 gyr .",
    "this means that even if we allow for the uncertainties in our age determination due to uncertainties in the modeling of stellar evolutionary tracks the age of the hr 1614 moving group is @xmath68 5 gyr younger than the old open cluster ngc 6791 .",
    "also , the metallicity of ngc 6791 is almost 0.2 dex higher than that of the hr 1614 moving group . combining these facts the association of the hr 1614 moving group with ngc 6791 must be incorrect .",
    "our sample provides a sample for future studies of the abundance profiles in old moving groups to address the question whether or not todays field stars originate in stellar clusters subsequently dissolved .",
    "it is at the higher metallicities , i.e. @xmath65 } \\geq 0.1 $ ] dex , that differences in star formation histories will manifest themselves in the abundance ratios ( e.g. pagel 1997 , fig 8.6 , and matteucci 1991 ) .",
    "if metal - rich stars in the field originate in clusters then abundance ratios for stars in a metal - rich moving group should be identical to those of the field stars in the solar neighbourhood . on the other hand",
    "if the moving groups are not the source of the field stars then it is most likely that their star formation rate was different and thus the resulting elemental abundances will be different . if the star formation rate was more rapid in the cluster than what is typical for the places where the metal - rich stars , now in the solar neighborhood , were born then the [ @xmath88/fe ] will be larger at say [ fe / h]@xmath89 dex for the group stars than for the field stars . if on the other hand the star formation rate was lower [ @xmath88/fe ] will be smaller , pagel ( 1997 fig . 8.6 ) .",
    "utilizing the new possibilities given by the hipparcos mission we perform , for the first time , an unbiased search in the @xmath3-plane of all stars with measured radial velocities and find an over - density of stars more metal - rich than the sun close to the @xmath40 and @xmath20 values associated with the moving group hr 1614 ( eggen 1998b ) .",
