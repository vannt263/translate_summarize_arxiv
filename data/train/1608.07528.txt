    "finite optical beams do not always follow the laws of geometrical optics . a beam of light , after reflecting from a planar interface , will shift from the path predicted by ray optics .",
    "the shift may occur in a direction that is either parallel or perpendicular to the plane of incidence , corresponding to the goos - hnchen ( gh ) and imbert - fedorov ( if ) shifts , respectively  @xcite . for incidence angles below the critical angle @xmath0 for total internal reflection ( tir ) , under partial reflection",
    ", the shift corresponds to an angular deflection of the beam , and it exhibits an axial dependance consisting of a linear function of beam propagation distance . above @xmath0 , under tir , the beam shift is lateral in nature , and it shows no axial dependence for a well collimated beam .",
    "but for a focused incident beam , the gh and if shifts may become linearly dependent on the beam propagation distance , leading to a propagation enhancement of both shifts  @xcite .",
    "this linear enhancement due to propagation was experimentally observed in  @xcite .",
    "the lateral gh shift has its physical origin in the angular dispersion of the complex fresnel reflection coefficients .",
    "its angular counterpart results from fresnel filtering  @xcite , which leads to a spatial asymmetry , or deformation , of the optical beam . from a theoretical point of view , the study of laser propagation in dielectric blocks plays an important role in understanding under which conditions it is possible to observe the development of an asymmetry in optical beams  @xcite .",
    "optical beam shifts are interesting not only because of their fundamental nature , but also because of their applications in areas such as optical microscopy  @xcite , high - sensitivity temperature sensors  @xcite and high - sensitivity chemical vapor detection  @xcite .    for a finite beam with waist radius @xmath1",
    ", the transition from an angular to a lateral gh shift occurs in the critical region  @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the angle of incidence , and @xmath4 is the wavelength . for a very large beam , there is no critical region , and the transition from angular to lateral shift occurs at @xmath0 .",
    "however , for a small @xmath1 , there exists a range of incidence angles for which the beam experiences a composite gh ( cgh ) shift , consisting of both an angular and a lateral shift  @xcite .",
    "the gh shift has been studied theoretically near @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the shift depends on @xmath1 and @xmath3 , and it peaks at an angle @xmath3 slightly larger than @xmath0 .",
    "but to this date , there is limited experimental data available in the critical region , taken in the microwave  @xcite and mid - infrared  @xcite regimes .",
    "furthermore , theoretical and experimental results for near - critical incidence are not in good agreement  @xcite",
    ". therefore , new experimental and theoretical work in the critical region are necessary to better elucidate the physics of the gh effect near critical incidence .",
    "theoretical studies  @xcite have shown that the interplay between the angular and lateral gh shifts in the critical region will greatly affect the cgh shift of a propagated beam . in ref .",
    "@xcite , an approximate analytical expression for the cgh is derived , showing that this interplay results in a _ nonlinear _ dependence of the cgh shift on the beam propagation distance @xmath5 . a recent work by one of the authors  @xcite showed that the nonlinear axial @xmath5 dependance leads to an enhancement of the cgh shift for a propagated beam with respect to the shift evaluated at the near field ( @xmath6 , where @xmath7 ) .",
    "lateral beam shifts are very small ( typically on the order of @xmath4 ) compared to the physical size of the beam . and angular shifts are usually smaller than the beam divergence . therefore , beam shifts are difficult to measure for optical wavelengths . to overcome this difficulty , an optical analog of the weak measurement technique @xcite has been successfully used to investigate the lateral  @xcite and angular  @xcite gh shifts , as well as the if shift  @xcite . in a weak measurement ,",
    "the measured system is projected onto a certain post - selected final state , nearly orthogonal to the initial state , giving rise to a measured weak value that may take on very large ( amplified ) values .",
    "the measurement is weak in the sense that the magnitude of the beam shift is much smaller than the beam diameter . in @xcite , using weak measurements , merano and colleagues experimentally verified , in the near infrared , the classical artmann result @xcite for incidence angles far above @xmath0 .",
    "an interesting feature of their result is that the amplification of the gh shift was a constant factor of 100 for any angle of incidence .",
    "in this letter , we use a weak measurement scheme to experimentally observe the cgh shift , and we test the theoretical predictions given in  @xcite regarding the effect of beam propagation on the cgh shift .",
    "ours is also the first experimental investigation of the cgh shift with visible light .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig1 ] illustrates our experimental setup .",
    "the output of a he - ne laser ( at @xmath8  nm ) is coupled into a single mode fiber for spatial filtering purposes as well as for improving the beam - pointing stability .",
    "the output beam of the fiber is expanded and collimated with lenses @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the collimated beam passes through lens @xmath11 ( with an effective focal length of 1  m ) producing a focused beam with beam waist radius @xmath12 m .",
    "the focused beam can be considered to be gaussian to a very good approximation given its measured @xmath13 .",

    "it is made of bk7 glass with a refractive index of @xmath22 at 632.8  nm , so the corresponding critical angle for tir is @xmath23 .",
    "the prism legs are anti - reflection coated to reduce unwanted internal reflections , but its hypotenuse is uncoated .",
    "the prism is mounted on a high - precision rotation mount equipped with a micrometer and vernier scale that together provide a 5 arcmin resolution when rotating the prism to adjust the beam s angle of incidence .",
    "the high resolution of the rotation mount is an important aspect of the experimental setup since the critical region is very narrow : @xmath24 .",

    "the laser beam is incident on the front leg of the prism , reflects at its hypotenuse ( which is positioned at the beam waist of the focused laser beam ) , and exits via the prism s back leg .",

    "rotatable zero - order half ( hwp ) and quarter ( qwp ) wave plates are used to cancel the relative phase difference between the orthogonal @xmath19 and @xmath20 polarization components acquired by the beam upon reflection  @xcite .",
    "analyzer @xmath15 is mounted on a high - precision rotational mount that allows us to set its orientation with a resolution of 5 arcmin .",
    "after emerging from @xmath15 , the diverging laser beam is detected by a ccd camera .",
    "the camera monitors the beam spatial profile , which is analyzed by a beam - pointing stability software to measure the beam centroid position with a typical @xmath26 m precision .",
    "the wave plates , analyzer and ccd camera are mounted on a platform that is repositioned whenever the prism is rotated so that the laser beam always impinges perpendicularly onto the camera .    to measure the cgh shift , associated with the @xmath27 coordinate , we follow a similar procedure to that prescribed in  @xcite for a weak measurement : for any particular angle of incidence , with polarizer @xmath15 set to orthogonal position relative to @xmath14 ( @xmath28 ) , we adjust the qwp and hwp in order to minimize the transmitted power . figure  2a shows a typical resulting transmitted beam profile .",
    "it consists of two peaks separated by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the beam @xmath31 radius expected for the input gaussian beam at the ccd plane .",
    "next , we turn @xmath15 to @xmath32 , where @xmath33 .",
    "figure  2b shows the observed beam profile . far above @xmath0",
    ", one would observe a single gaussian peak , as reported in  @xcite .",
    "but near @xmath0 we see that the beam profile consists of two peaks , one being much larger in intensity than the other . in our beam pointing stability software we select a region of interest containing the larger peak and measure its centroid position .",
    "the software acquires data at a fast rate , quickly gathering 1000 data values for the centroid position .",
    "we then set @xmath15 to @xmath34 and again measure the centroid position of only the larger peak .",
    "having measured the two centroids positions , we determine their separation @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , with the weak measurement technique we measure the amplified difference between the cgh shift for the @xmath19 and @xmath20 polarizations , and not the individual cgh shifts for these two waves .",
    "we repeated this procedure for various angles of incidence around @xmath0 ( @xmath36 ) , always keeping the prism - camera distance constant , within experimental error .",
    "we investigated two different axial distances : @xmath37  cm and @xmath38 cm . very near",
