    "about ten fr ii radio galaxies @xcite are very peculiar and consist of a pair of symmetric double - lobed radio structures with one common center and two extended and edge - brightened inner radio lobes @xcite .",
    "the inner structure has a well aligned axis with the outer lobes and a relatively lower luminosity .",
    "these radio sources are called double - double radio galaxies ( ddrgs ) and their structures are most likely due to the interruption and restarting of jet formation at the central engine with an interruption time of the order of myr @xcite .",
    "interruption- and recurrent - jet phenomenon is also detected in some non - ddrg radio sources , e.g. 3c288 @xcite , 3c219 @xcite , b1144 + 352 @xcite , and the compact symmetric object ( cso ) b0108 + 388 @xcite .",
    "while the evolution of re - current jets in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) has been investigated in some detail @xcite , the mechanism to interrupt and restart the jet formation in the center of agns is unclear .",
    "the proposed scenarios in literature include a passive magnetic field model @xcite , internal instability in the accretion disk due to the radiation pressure induced warping @xcite , a large fraction of the gas left by the secondary galaxy in a merging or colliding galaxy system @xcite .",

    "the the internal warping instability is likely to change the direction of the jet considerably @xcite .",
    "the falling or colliding gas model has difficulty to explain the abrupt interruption and restarting of jet formation and is not consistent with the observations of no evidence for galaxy interaction in ddrgs .",
    "it was found recently that the central black hole masses in active and inactive galaxies have tight correlations with the central velocity dispersions ( e.g. @xcite ) and the bulge luminosities ( e.g. @xcite ) of the host galaxies .",
    "these relations imply that the activity of agns may be triggered by galaxy merging and present - day galaxies are probably the product of successive minor mergers @xcite .",

    "the secondary interacts radially with the accretion disk and opens a gap in it . when the gravitation radiation dominates the loss of the orbital angular momentum at a smaller semimajor axis @xmath14 , the secondary rapidly pushes inwards the gas trapped inside the orbit and the gap gets wider with the decreasing of the binary separation .",
    "when two super - massive black holes merge , the gap becomes a big hole in the vicinity of the primary and and the inner accretion disk disappears .",
    "the jet formation interrupts .",
    "when the inner edge of the outer accretion disk slowly involves inwards and reaches the last stable orbit , the big hole is refilled with the disk materials and jet formation restarts . we show that the observed interruption time of jet formation in ddrgs is the viscous time for the accreted plasma to refill the inner disk .",
