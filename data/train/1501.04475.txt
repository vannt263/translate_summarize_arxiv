    "it is well known that the eigenvalues of a random matrix drawn from the ensemble ( [ pue ] ) form a determinantal point process .",
    "the joint probability distribution of the eigenvalues is given by [ jpdf ] ( x)^2_j=1^n x_j^e^-nv_k(x_j)dx_j,(x)=_1i < jn ( x_j - x_i ) , with the partition function @xmath10 given by [ partition function ] z_n , k=_[0,+)^n(x)^2 _ j=1^n x_j^e^-nv_k(x_j)dx_j .",
    "for @xmath11 small , the model ( [ pue ] ) can be seen as a singular perturbation of the unitary invariant ensemble corresponding to @xmath6 . for @xmath11 ,",
    "the eigenvalues are pushed away from @xmath12 because of the pole in the potential , and for large @xmath13 , the probability of finding eigenvalues close to @xmath12 is small if @xmath11 is independent of @xmath13 . however",
    ", if @xmath14 together with @xmath7 , this repulsion becomes weaker and one expects a transition between a regime where eigenvalues are likely to be found in the vicinity of the origin , and one where eigenvalues are unlikely to be found near the origin .",
    "the effect of singular perturbations of unitary invariant ensembles has been of recent interest @xcite . in @xcite , the singularly perturbed laguerre unitary ensemble ( plue )",
    "was studied , given by the measure [ plue ] ( m)^dm , on the space @xmath1 , where @xmath15 is a normalisation constant . a relation between this model and the painlev iii ( henceforth piii ) equation",
    "was established for fixed @xmath13 in @xcite . in subsequent work",
    "@xcite , a singular perturbation of the gaussian unitary ensemble , which we will refer to as pgue , was studied , defined by the measure dm , on the set of @xmath2 hermitian matrices @xmath16 .    in @xcite the double scaling limit where @xmath17 as @xmath18 of the partition function was analysed using riemann - hilbert ( rh ) techniques .",
    "a connection to piii was also found by relating the orthogonal polynomials associated to the pgue measure to those of the plue measure . in @xcite ,",
    "the double scaling limit for the eigenvalue correlation kernel in the plue was studied .",
    "a limiting kernel was found , defined in terms of a model rh problem associated to a special solution of the piii equation .",
    "this limiting kernel degenerates to the airy kernel if @xmath19 approaches @xmath12 at a slow rate , and to the bessel hard edge kernel if @xmath14 at a fast rate . in @xcite",
    ", asymptotics for the partition function in the plue , again in terms of a piii transcendent , were obtained .    in the present work ,",
    "we will obtain asymptotics for the eigenvalue correlation kernel for a fairly general class of potentials @xmath4 , perturbed with a pole of order @xmath20 , in a double scaling limit where the strength of the perturbation , @xmath19 , goes to zero at an appropriate speed as the size of the matrix , @xmath13 , is taken to infinity .",
    "the double scaling limit will be tuned in such a way that the macroscopic behaviour of the eigenvalues in the large @xmath13 limit is the same as in the non - singular case where @xmath6 , but such that the microscopic behaviour of the eigenvalues near @xmath12 is affected by the singularity of the potential .",
    "in addition , we will obtain double scaling asymptotics for the partition functions associated to the lue perturbed with a pole of order @xmath0 , and to the gue perturbed with a pole of order @xmath21 .",
    "our results will be described in terms of special solutions to a family of systems of odes , indexed by @xmath20 , which can be seen as a hierarchy of painlev iii equations .",
    "there are a number of motivations for considering the model ( [ pue ] ) .",
    "firstly , it was observed that critical one - matrix models in which the limiting mean density of eigenvalues vanishes in the bulk of the spectrum or at a higher than generic order at the edge of the spectrum , are in one - to - one correspondence with ( super-)liouville field theories . in this context , it is natural to look for models with higher order critical points in which multiple zeros appear in the bulk or at the edge of the spectral density , as it is known that such higher order critical models correspond to coupling a minimal conformal field theory to ( super)-liouville theory .",
    "a review of these facts in the non - supersymmetric case can be found in @xcite .",
    "supersymmetric versions followed later in @xcite and are nicely reviewed in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "one - matrix models in which the potential has poles exhibit a new type of critical behaviour .",
    "although at present no conformal field theory analogue of such models is known , it is again natural to study higher order critical points in this context",
    ".    a second physical motivation arises in the field of quantum transport and electrical characteristics of chaotic cavities . here",
    "the quantity of interest is the wigner - smith time - delay matrix @xmath22 , the eigenvalues of which , @xmath23 , are known as the `` partial delay times '' . in systems in which the dynamics is chaotic , a rmt approach has been quite successful and one of the central results of this approach is the joint probability density for the inverse delay times , @xmath24 , first obtained in @xcite .",
    "it takes the form p(_1 ,  , _ n ) = |()|^_j=1^n _ j^n/2 e^- _ j , where @xmath25 depends on the symmetries of the system , with @xmath26 a common case . since",
    "many observables may be expressed in terms of @xmath22 , the problem of computing expectation values with respect to the above measure is relevant .",
    "in particular the observable _ w = q = ^n_i = 1 _ i , known as the wigner time - delay has been considered in the recent work @xcite .",
    "the partition function for our model coincides with the moment generating function for the probability density of @xmath27 in the case @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "although we will not scale @xmath30 with @xmath13 in the present paper , the moment generating function in this model is the partition function for a matrix model which shares the feature of a singular potential with our model ( [ pue ] ) .",
    "furthermore , in a very recent paper @xcite , an observable @xmath31 known as the `` charge relaxation resistance '' defined as r_q = was considered . to compute @xmath31 ,",
    "the approach taken in @xcite was to compute the distributions of @xmath32 and @xmath33 separately .",
    "the associated moment generating function is the partition function for a perturbed plue model with a singularity in the potential of order @xmath34 , thereby demonstrating the physical relevance of the model studied here for @xmath35 .",
    "a third motivating model appears in the field of spin - glasses @xcite . here",
    "a model corresponding to the goe perturbed by a pole of order @xmath0 was analysed for its relation to the distribution of the spin glass susceptibility in the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) mean - field model .",
    "the gue version of the partition function in such a model relates directly to the partition function in the plue , as we will see later on in this paper .",
    "one - matrix models in which the potential has poles have also appeared in the context of replica field theories  @xcite .",
    "finally , our last motivation for this work is to seek a natural candidate for a piii hierarchy .",
    "the notion of a piii hierarchy has appeared little in the literature ; one of the few mentions being @xcite .",
    "this work was partly motivated by the desire to understand whether the hierarchy proposed in @xcite would appear when the order of the pole was increased and if not , what form the alternative hierarchy takes .",
    "it appears that the hierarchy of equations which we will obtain is different from the one in @xcite .",
    "our main results are the following .    1 .",
    "we define a hierarchy of higher order piii equations and prove the existence of special pole - free solutions to it .",
    "2 .   we obtain double scaling asymptotics for the partition function in the lue perturbed with a pole of order @xmath36 , in terms of a higher order piii transcendent .",
    "this generalizes the result from @xcite for @xmath28 .",
    "we obtain double scaling asymptotics for the partition function in the gue perturbed with a pole of order @xmath21 , @xmath36 .",
    "they are again given in terms of higher order piii transcendents .",
    "in the case @xmath28 , such asymptotics were already obtained in @xcite , but written in a different form .",
    "4 .   in the double scaling limit , we prove , for @xmath36 and for general @xmath4 , that the eigenvalue correlation kernel near @xmath12 of the model ( [ pue ] ) tends to a limiting kernel built out of a model rh problem associated to the piii hierarchy .",
    "this extends the result from @xcite for @xmath37 and @xmath28 .",
    "we now state our results in more detail .      given @xmath38 , consider the system of @xmath39 odes indexed by @xmath40 , [ p3def ] _",

    "the @xmath43 s are real constants that play the role of times .",
