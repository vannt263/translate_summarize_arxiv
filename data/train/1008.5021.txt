    "hr 8799 is a late a / early f star located at 39.4 pc , with t@xmath1 @xmath0 7350k , m@xmath2 = 1.5 m@xmath3 and a @xmath4 bootis - like pattern of surface metallicity .",
    "the star has received a very high level of attention since the imaging of three massive substellar objects in large radius orbits around it ( marois et al .",
    "hr 8799 and fomalhaut ( kalas et al .",
    "2008 ) are the only two firm examples of systems with separations @xmath5 50 au between the star and planetary - mass companions .",
    "both stars also have luminous planetary debris disks that can provide further insight to the outer structures of their planetary systems ( e.g. , stapelfeldt et al .",
    "2004 ; su et al .",
    "given the bias in current planet - discovery techniques toward close companions , the existence and properties of these widely separated examples open a new perspective on the diversity of planetary systems .",
    "the nature of the companions of hr 8799 depends critically on the age of the system , since their cooling rates ( baraffe et al .",
    "2003 ) enter strongly into the relation of their luminosities to their masses .",
    "the star is near the zero - age main sequence , where traditional methods for estimating its age are not accurate .",
    "marois et al . (",
    "2008 ) used a variety of argumentsm from its debris disk also suggests a young system . ] to estimate an age of a @xmath6 myr and on this basis assign masses of @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath8 m@xmath9 respectively to hr 8799 b , c , and d. janson et al .",
    "( 2010 ) used vlt / naco to obtain spatially resolved spectroscopy of hr 8799 c from 3.88 to 4.10 @xmath10 m .",
    "although there are some discrepancies in the slope of the spectrum beyond 4 @xmath10 m , it can generally be fitted by a cond model from baraffe et al .",
    "( 2003 ) with t@xmath11 = 1100 k , log g = 4.0 and r@xmath12 = 1.3 r@xmath9 .",
    "these characteristics are consistent with the mass estimate for planet c of 10 m@xmath9 at 60 myr by marois et al .",
    "the minimum mass for deuterium burning , @xmath0 13 m@xmath9 , is often taken as the dividing line between planets and brown dwarfs , in which case these mass estimates indicate that hr 8799 hosts a fascinating planetary system .    however , moya et al . ( 2010a ) argue that the stellar age is still unconstrained , pointing out that some of the age estimators are compromised by the @xmath4 bootis character of the star or are statistical in nature .",
    "they used astroseismology to show that an older age of @xmath0 1 gyr is possible , if the inclination of the equatorial plane of the star is @xmath13 . because the masses of the companions are derived from the comparison of the observed luminosity to theoretical evolutionary tracks of giant planets and brown dwarfs , the age of the star is critical in determining these masses . at this older age ,",
    "the companion luminosities would have faded significantly and their assigned masses would be well into the brown dwarf range .",
    "thus , the nature of the hr 8799 system would change significantly .",
    "this would affect the formation scenarios under discussion , and the ability to use these three planets ( of similar age and metallicity ) to calibrate evolutionary and atmospheric models of giant planets .    in this letter",
    ", we assess the possibility of more massive companions by considering the limiting case in which the masses of the planets are set to the largest values that dynamical stability can allow ( section [ planet_conf ] ) . given the observed planetary luminosities and using evolutionary models , we estimate the age corresponding to these limiting masses .",
    "we then evaluate the stability of the planets and the dust - producing planetesimals during that timescale to assess whether an older age could still lead to a planetary system ( planets + planetesimals ) consistent with the observations ( section [ stability ] ) .",
    "we discuss the results in section [ discussion ] .",
    "[ intro_planets ]",
    "we now consider whether the configuration of the companions can help resolve the uncertainty over the age of hr 8799 .",
    "the companions have been detected in hst / nicmos archival data taken 10 years prior to the discovery image ( lafreniere et al .",
    "2009 ) , however , their long orbital periods make the determination of the orbital parameters still uncertain . while there are several configurations that would fit ( 1 ) the astrometry , ( 2 ) the observed luminosities , and ( 3 ) the requirement that the system is stable for at least 30 - 160 myr , dynamical analysis by various authors converge on a solution in which the companions are on nearly circular orbits , locked into a double 4:2:1 mean motion resonance ( 1d:2c:4b ) . this possibility was first suggested by fabryck & murray - clay ( 2010 ) , and latter confirmed by godziewski & migaszewski ( 2009 ) and reidemeister et al .",
    "( for a summary of the possible orbital solutions see section 2.4.2 in moro - martn et al .",
    "the companions avoid close encounters in the resonant configuration , ensuring dynamical stability .    in this paper , we focus on this configuration because it may be the only solution that can guarantee the dynamical stability of the system on a timescale comparable to the stellar age , and in the case of massive planets .",
    "the analysis in fabrycky & murray - clay ( 2010 ) concluded that , under this configuration , the planetary masses can be increased up to 1.9 times their nominal values ( see their figure 11 ) .",
    "therefore , we consider the following planetary masses with orbital elements listed in table [ planetparam ] : 1.27@xmath1410@xmath15 m@xmath16 (= 13.30 m@xmath9 ) for planet b , and 1.80@xmath1410@xmath15 m@xmath16 (= 18.85 m@xmath9 ) for planets c and d ; this would put planets c and d well into the brown dwarf regime , while planet b would be near the transition .",

    "configurations with planetary masses more massive than these can not have a stable corotation orbit in the 2:1 resonance .",

    "we therefore conclude that the large companion masses considered in this paper are unlikely and that the dynamical state of the system favors ages of @xmath0 100 myr and companion masses slightly below the brown dwarf regime .",
