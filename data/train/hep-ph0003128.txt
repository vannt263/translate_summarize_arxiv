    "muon colliders have negligible bremstrahlung and the beam energy can be measured very accurately by muon precession in the collider ring .",
    "momentum spreads as low as @xmath0 are thought to be achievable for a low - energy collider@xcite .",
    "the beam energy could be determined with a precision of @xmath1 by measuring the time - dependent decay asymmetry resulting from the naturally polarized muons@xcite .",
    "in addition , initial state radiation is smaller than at a electron - positron machine .",
    "these features make muon colliders especially useful for studying narrow resonances@xcite , and for measuring production cross sections near threshold where they change very rapidly@xcite .",
    "however the cross sections are smaller near threshold , so high luminosity is required .",
    "an important feature of cross sections near threshold is that they isolate the effects of the width and spin of the produced particle .",
    "the threshold cross section is a function of the particle s mass , decay width , spin , and coupling strength(s ) , and it ( largely ) factorizes near the threshold into an overall normalization and an energy - dependent part ( profile ) .",
    "the energy profile depends on the particle mass which dictates where in energy the cross section begins to rise ; we say the cross section `` turns on '' near @xmath2 .",
    "the particle width and spin govern how fast the cross section rises with energy .",
    "the width is important because , on the one hand , we can think of the particle being produced and then subsequently decaying ( the narrow width approximation ) ; but on the other hand , one can more accurately view the process as one in which the decay products are the final state and the decaying particle is a virtual particle .",
    "the rate the cross section rises depends then on the required `` off - shellness '' of this virtual particle .",
    "as an example consider the cross section for @xmath3 followed by the decay @xmath4 is given by@xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the cross section for producing two virtural @xmath7 bosons with invariant masses - squared of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the branching ratio for the decay @xmath11 .",
    "the weighting factor @xmath12 arises from the @xmath7 boson propagator and controls the rise of the cross section , @xmath13    the cross section @xmath6 is controlled by kinematics and angular momentum conservation for the region that @xmath14 and @xmath15 have significant support near @xmath16 .",
    "the couplings and radiative corrections are approximately energy - independent over this narrow range , and do not impact on the energy profile , but do affect the overall number of events expected .",
    "supersymmetric charginos can be pair produced at a muon collider .",
    "the two contributing feynman diagrams for @xmath17 is shown in fig .",
    "[ feynman ] .",
    "these two diagrams interfere desctructively over most of parameter space .",
    "the threshold measurement of the process @xmath18 yields the following : a measurement of the @xmath19 mass , an indirect measurement of the @xmath20 mass , and a measurement of the overall normalization of the cross section .",
    "= 3.5 in    the supersymmetric masses are known functions of the undetermined fundamental parameters of a given supersymmetric model , and are a window on the details of the supersymmetry breaking .",
    "for example the chargino mass matrix is @xmath21    the fundamental parameters of the supersymmetric model are the @xmath22 gaugino mass @xmath23 , the supersymmetric higgs mass @xmath24 , and the ratio of the vevs of the two higgs doublets vacuum expectation values , @xmath25 .",
    "the physically measured chargino masses @xmath26 and @xmath26 are obtained by diagonalizing this matrix .",
    "the masses and widths are complicated functions of fundamental parameters , but accurate measurements of the chargino masses constrain one to be on a slice through the parameter space of fundamental parameters .",
    "the impact of different amounts of beam smearing is shown in fig .",
    "[ beamsm ] .",
    "the narrow beam spread ( @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the rms spread of the energy of a muon beam ) of a muon collider can prove especially advantageous when the widths of the produced particles is substantially less than a gev .",
    "= 3.25 in    = 3.25 in    the chargino production cross section decreases with increasing chargino mass . therefore the precision with which the mass can be measured is better at smaller values of the mass .",
    "figure  [ prec ] shows the expect precision with 100  fb@xmath29 integrated luminosity for sneutrino masses of 300 and 500  gev . for a lighter sneutrino ,",
    "for which the destructive interference between the @xmath30-channel and @xmath31-channel graphs is more severe , the precision obtained is reduced .",
    "the sneutrino mass can be measured to about 6  gev accuracy for @xmath32  gev and to about 20  gev accuracy for @xmath33  gev@xcite .",
    "scalar production is @xmath34-wave suppressed , so the threshold production cross section looks very different than for fermion pair production .",
    "for example one can compare top quark production to top squark production near threshold@xcite .",
    "the top squark cross section shows a slow @xmath35 rise with little resonance structure@xcite .",
    "the top squark threshold profile is very different that of the top quark . by measuring energy profile",
    ", one can determine the produced particle s spin .",
    "if the squarks are for some reason especially long - lived , then bounds states might be formed that would appear in the threshold cross section@xcite .",
    "an accurate determination of the supersymmetric higgs boson mass @xmath36 can be obtained by measuring the threshold cross section for the bjorken higgs - strahlung process@xcite @xmath37 .",
    "the higgs boson could be discovered in the @xmath38 production mode by running the collider well above threshold . for @xmath39 , as one expects in supersymmetric models , the primary decay channel is @xmath40 , and most backgrounds can be eliminated by @xmath41-tagging .",
    "the higgs cross section near threshold is sensitive to the higgs mass and width . in fig .",
    "[ zhsin2 ] the results@xcite for a higgs mass around 100  gev are displayed .",
    "the solid curves show the @xmath42 contours for determining the higgs mass versus @xmath43 , or versus @xmath44 , by devoting @xmath45 to each of the c.m .",
    "energies @xmath46  gev , @xmath47  gev and @xmath48  gev at a muon collider . included .",
    "the dashed curve shows the @xmath49 contour that results when @xmath50 is negligibly small and 50  fb@xmath29 is devoted to each of the c.m .",
    "energies @xmath51  gev and @xmath52  gev .",
    "muon colliders offer advantages for performing threshold cross section measurements : no beamstrahlung , small beam energy spread , reduced initial state radiation .    precise measurements of particle masses and widths are possible , and the shape of the threshold cross section can be measured to determined the produced particle s spin .",
