    "nonlinear open systems often produce bistabilities or dynamical phase transitions .",
    "a nice example is the behavior of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in a pumped high - finesse optical cavity , where the nonlinearity is produced by the dispersive atom - light interaction @xcite .",
    "the weak cavity pumping causes a classical electromagnetic field to build up between the mirrors .",
    "the atoms coupled dispersively to the radiation field detune the cavity according to the overlap of their spatial distribution with the mode function of the electric field .",
    "consequently , the cavity resonance frequency can be shifted away from or towards the frequency of the pumping laser ; thereby a big variation in intensity can be induced merely by the spatial redistribution of the atoms . in turn",
    ", the intensity change translates into the variation of the depth of the optical dipole potential , and so it acts back upon the atomic distribution itself . in a tiny region of the parameter settings close to the cavity resonance",
    "two stable or metastable configurations can exist , giving rise to a dynamical phase transition .",
    "atom - light interaction itself is a major issue in the studies of ultracold quantum gases , being the most universal tool in accessing the properties of the system either by slowing the cloud of atoms , trapping them in classical potentials , putting obstacles in their path , or finally detecting and imaging them .",
    "moreover , recent proposals have raised the possibility of quantum state preparation of the atomic ensemble with the help of measuring the output photon signal of a pumped optical resonator @xcite .",
    "the cornerstone of such a quantum state preparation with the help of a quantum nondemolition measurement is also the mutual backaction between the atomic and photonic degrees of freedom .",
    "the study of correlations between atomic motion and light generated by atom - light interaction in an optical cavity is therefore of fundamental importance .",
    "an important research area on the manifestation of light - matter interaction is optomechanics , where the radiation pressure force of a single mode fabry - prot resonator is used to manipulate the center of mass motion of a mechanical oscillator . for a short review on optomechanical systems and on their experimental realizations",
    "@xcite , and also references therein .",
    "the reason of popularity of optomechanical studies , besides experimental realizability , is that the theoretical description can be performed relatively simply , involving only the few modes of the cavity field and one mode for the motion of the mirror @xcite .",
    "such a paradigmatic system is an ideal playground to test correlations between light and mesoscopic objects , to understand the underlying physics and to speculate on possible applications in quantum information processing .    in recent experiments done with ultracold bosons in optical resonators",
    "the above concepts unify nicely @xcite .",
    "the cavity radiation field couples to a single collective motional excitation of the bose condensed atomic sample . starting the experiment with a pure bose - einstein condensate ,",
    "other motional excitations can be safely disregarded and so a situation analogous to optomechanics can be realized without a movable mirror , but rather with the collective motion of an ensemble of atoms .",
    "the difference between the experimental tools ( manipulation and detection methods ) of traditional optomechanical systems and those with ultracold gases nicely complement each other , while the theoretical description is very similar .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to discuss correlations generated in a hybrid system of ultracold bosons and the radiation field , especially close to the region of parameter settings where the system shows bistability and where the optomechanical simplification can be harvested .",
    "photons leaking out of the resonator make the cavity field noisy , which infiltrates the dynamics of atomic motion @xcite . in turn ,",
    "quantum fluctuations of the atom field have a back - action on the photon statistics .",
    "correlated fluctuations of the light and matter wave fields appear then , which are strongly enhanced close to the critical regime of bistability .",
    "the study of correlations is further motivated by the need for justifying the basic assumption of the generally used mean - field theories @xcite , namely , that the atom - photon cross correlations are negligible and mean values of the light and atomic operators can be decoupled .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the backbone of the paper is sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , where the model and the theoretical description of the system in mean - field level is presented in great detail .",
    "many of the elements of other theoretical models , e.g. , the cavity cooling of bec excitations @xcite , spatial self - organization of a bec in the cavity @xcite , and the transient collective atomic recoil lasing @xcite will be recapitulated here to give a full account of the mean field dynamics of a bec in a cavity .",
    "the aim , partially , is to reach the optomechanical model and discuss the assumptions and approximations to arrive there .",
    "special attention is paid to the effect of nonlinearities : ( i ) the nonlinearity caused by atom - light interaction , responsible for the creation of a periodic optical potential and also for an effective atom - atom collective interaction , and ( ii ) the nonlinearity caused by atomic s - wave collisions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : res ] we present first mean - field results and compare them to experimental observations , wherever applicable .",
    "furthermore , the auto- and cross - correlations of the quantum fluctuations of the fields will be calculated in the stationary state formed by the balance of cavity loss and vacuum noise driving .",
    "finally , a summary is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : disc ] .",
    "the system consists of a single mode , high - finesse optical fabry - prot resonator with a waist much smaller than the cavity length and a sample of dilute , ultracold bosonic atoms prepared to be bose - einstein condensed .",
    "the condensate is supposed to be cigar shaped along the cavity axis , with a strong transverse confinement .",
    "the radiation field inside the cavity is pumped through one of its mirrors by a laser with frequency @xmath0 and wavenumber @xmath1 , with @xmath2 being the speed of light . the laser frequency is far detuned from the atomic transitions , so the populations of the electronic excited states are negligible . in this limit",
    "the atomic internal degrees of freedom are frozen ; and the atom - light interaction is purely dispersive . on the other hand ,",
    "the cavity frequency @xmath3 lies close to the pump frequency @xmath0 : the detuning @xmath4 is comparable to @xmath5 , this latter being half of the inverse lifetime of a photon inside the cavity .      in the frame co - rotating with the pumping laser field the hamiltonian of the system can be approximated as    @xmath6    @xmath7 is the hamilton operator of the ground state atoms inside the cavity , given by @xmath8\\psi(x ) dx,\\ ] ] with @xmath9 being the mass of the atoms , @xmath10 is the external confining potential along the cavity axis and @xmath11 being the s - wave scattering constant in 1-dimension .",
    "the term @xmath12 of the hamiltonian describes the radiation field of the empty , single - mode cavity , @xmath13 the dispersive interaction between the cavity radiation field and the atoms in this low excitation limit is given by the ac - stark shift , or light shift : @xmath14 with @xmath15 being the single atom light - shift , @xmath16 ; the unique longitudinal mode function of the single mode cavity is @xmath17 with wavenumber @xmath18 .",
    "the part describing the coupling of the cavity field to that of the pump laser is given by @xmath19    with @xmath20 being the strength of the driving field ; and the asterisk stands for complex conjugation .",
    "the last part of the hamiltonian , @xmath21 describes the interaction of the cavity field with the broadband reservoir of external radiation field modes via the partially transmissive mirrors",
    ". we will give account for this interaction within the markov approximation , by means of introducing a loss rate @xmath22 and a gaussian white noise operator @xmath23 in the heisenberg equation of motion for the field operators @xcite .",
    "the equation of motion of the photonic annihilation operator is given by    [ eqs : eqmo ] @xmath24a(t)\\\\   + i",
    "\\eta + i\\xi(t),\\label{eq : eqmores}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] with @xmath25 the local single atom light - shift , which is a periodic function .",
    "its period is noticeably @xmath26 , since it contains the mode function squared .",
    "the operator @xmath23 describes gaussian white noise with zero mean and with the only non - vanishing correlation @xmath27 it is nicely exhibited in eq .",
    ", that the dispersive interaction between the atoms and the radiation field causes a shift in the resonator frequency proportional to the atomic density @xmath28 .",
    "however , this frequency shift is an operator and couples the equations of motion of the radiation field to those of the atomic field operators in a nonlinear way .",
    "the equation of motion of the atomic field operator reads @xmath29\\psi(x , t).\\label{eq : eqmoat}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    in the atomic part of the equation of motion , in addition to the inert trap potential @xmath30 , the atom - light interaction creates a @xmath31 periodic optical potential for the atoms , proportional to the dynamical photon number operator @xmath32 .      to solve the coupled nonlinear operator equations",
    "simultaneously is a hard task .",
    "the most convenient approximation is the mean - field approximation , when one separates first the operators into a mean value and to fluctuations around it :    [ eqs : sepmf ] @xmath33    the mean values are c - numbers , defined as @xmath34 the so - called condensate wavefunction , which is normalized to unity ; and @xmath35 the coherent part of the cavity field .",
    "consequently , the fluctuations have zero mean .",
    "the time evolution of the mean values is obtained by substituting into the equations of motion and neglecting all terms containing fluctuations . by this way one arrives at a gross - pitaevskii like set of equations of the coupled dynamics    [ eqs : gpe ] @xmath36\\alpha(t)+i\\eta,\\label{eq : gperad}\\\\ i\\hslash\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\varphi(x , t)&=\\bigg[-\\frac{\\hslash^2\\delta}{2m}+v_{\\text{ext}}(x)+\\hslash|\\alpha(t)|^2u(x)\\nonumber\\\\ & + g\\,n\\,|\\varphi(x , t)|^2\\bigg]\\varphi(x , t),\\label{eq : gpeat}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with the notation @xmath37 .",
    "there is a simplification of the numerical problem due to the possible separation of time scales .",
    "the time evolution of eq .",
    "is governed by two characteristic frequencies , namely the detuning @xmath38 and the photon loss rate @xmath5 . in eq .",
    "the characteristic frequency is set by the recoil frequency @xmath39 . in experiments",
    "the latter one is usually several orders of magnitude smaller than the former ones .",
    "for example in the esslinger group experiments @xcite , the parameters @xmath40 , while the recoil frequency is about @xmath41 .",
    "in this situation the dynamics of the resonator field relaxes very fast compared to the dynamics of the atomic motion and therefore can be considered instantaneous with respect to the relaxation of the condensate .",
    "one can assume for any given atomic configuration that the resonator field has already reached its steady state value , which , by eq .",
    ", is @xmath42",
    "this steady - state mean field provides the optical potential in eq .  .",
    "so in the end one only integrates solely eq .  ,",
    "with @xmath43 adiabatically eliminated and inserted from eq .",
    ", instead of the coupled eqs .   and",
    ". it is worth noting that if the time scales of the resonator field and bec dynamics do not differ that much , some complex coupled solutions can exist @xcite , which need the simultaneous integration of eqs .   and .",
    "after the adiabatic elimination of the photon field @xmath44 , the most direct method to numerically calculate the steady state of the bec wavefunction @xmath45 is the one based on the imaginary - time propagation of eq .  .",
    "in real - time the steady - state solution has the time dependence : @xmath46 with @xmath47 the lowest frequency eigenvalue of the nonlinear problem . in imaginary time all fluctuations around the steady - state die out , since they propagate with higher frequencies in real time and consequently vanish faster in imaginary time than the steady - state solution .",
    "one just has to renormalize the solution @xmath48 after some finite propagation time .",
    "note that , since all quantities on the left hand side of eq .",
    "are real , the condensate wavefunction @xmath45 can also be chosen real .",
    "we also note at this point that , as we will see later , in the case of an effective blue detuning @xmath49 , the resonator field heats the atomic motion ( some excitations have positive imaginary parts ) and there is no steady - state condensate wavefunction at all .",
    "however , due to the method of imaginary time propagation , one can find a bec wavefunction even in this case , corresponding to a dynamically unstable equilibrium situation .",
    "having obtained the steady - state values of the bec wavefunction and the resonator field amplitude , one can look for the fluctuations of the annihilation ( and creation ) operators @xmath50 , @xmath51 ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) in linear order .",
    "this linear stability analysis corresponds to the bogoliubov theory of the bec system @xcite , and also have an analogy in optomechanics , and also in other nonlinear systems , especially in hydrodynamics . inserting the separation of the field operators into eqs .   and , and neglecting fluctuations higher than first order , one arrives to    [ eqs : fluct ]    @xmath54\\delta a(t ) + n\\alpha_{\\text{ss}}\\int \\varphi(x ) u(x)\\big[\\delta \\tilde\\psi(x , t)+\\delta\\tilde\\psi^\\dagger(x , t)\\big]\\,dx+i\\xi(t),\\label{eq : fluctrad}\\\\ i\\hslash\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\delta\\tilde\\psi(x , t)&=\\bigg[\\frac{\\hslash^2\\delta}{2 m } + v_{\\text{ext}}(x)+\\hslash|\\alpha_{\\text{ss}}|^2 u(x)-\\mu+gn\\varphi^2(x)\\bigg]\\delta\\tilde\\psi(x , t)+\\hslash u(x)\\varphi(x)\\big[\\alpha^*_{\\text{ss}}\\delta a(t)+\\alpha_{\\text{ss}}\\delta a^\\dagger(t)\\big]\\nonumber\\\\ & + gn\\varphi^2(x)\\big[\\delta\\tilde\\psi^\\dagger(x , t)+\\delta\\tilde\\psi(x , t)\\big].\\label{eq : fluctat}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the zeroth order terms cancel , since they fulfill eq .   and with @xmath55 .",
    "we have introduced @xmath56",
    ".    a closer look on eqs .",
    "reveals that the time evolution of the annihilation operators couple to those of the creation operators .",
    "it is a consequence of the complex nature of the photonic and particle fields . in order to diagonalize eqs .",
    "one can choose two equivalent ways .",
    "either one can separate the complex quantities into real and imaginary parts and study their time evolution ; this is the approach mainly used in optomechanical studies .",
    "the other way is to diagonalize the set of equations not just containing @xmath57 and @xmath58 , but also their hermitian adjoints @xmath59 and @xmath60 ; this approach is familiar from the bogoliubov - de gennes theory of superfluidity .    adopting",

    "it is a consequence that the effect of hermitian conjugation of @xmath67 can be obtained with a linear transformation @xmath68 that swaps the first row with the second one and simultaneously the third one with the fourth , so @xmath69 .",
    "it directly follows from eq .   and from this symmetry property that @xmath70    in order to study the correlations of the fluctuations one has to determine the time evolution of the fluctuation operators first .",
    "one has to introduce quasi - normal modes that diagonalize eq .   and therefore have a simple time evolution .",
    "let us denote by @xmath71 the right eigenvectors of @xmath66 , i.e. , @xmath72 with @xmath73 being the corresponding eigenvalue of @xmath66 .",
    "the fluctuation operator @xmath67 can be expanded with the help of the eigenvectors ( if they form a complete set ) @xmath74 with @xmath75 being the operator , or expansion coefficient , of the quasi - normal mode @xmath76 .",

    ".   and , the normal modes obey the following uncoupled equation of motion : @xmath82 with the transformed noise operator @xmath83 . on integrating eq .",
    ", the time dependence of the normal mode operators can be obtained : @xmath84 for a dynamically stable sytem , one needs to have eigenvalues with negative imaginary parts . in this case",
    "fluctuations ( the normal modes ) decay to a steady - state .",
    "the symmetry property has an important consequence on the spectrum of @xmath66 .",
    "namely , if @xmath85 is an eigenvalue of @xmath66 , than @xmath86 is also an eigenvalue of @xmath66 .",
    "the modes corresponding to these eigenvalues form a pair with positive and negative energies .",
    "there is an important issue concerning the stability of the normal modes : not all of them include the radiation components .",
    "for simplicity , assume that the external potential is even with respect to the center of the cavity .",
    "in this case the combined external and optical potentials is also even , and parity is a symmetry of the full system . in this case",
    "the condensate wavefunction is also even ; and the matrix @xmath66 commutes with the parity operator .",
    "the eigenfunctions of @xmath66 can therefore be classified by their symmetry ( being odd or even ) .",
    "if the condensate fluctuation parts ( third and fourth components ) of an eigenvector @xmath71 are odd , than the result of the operator @xmath87 acting on these components of @xmath71 is zero , since @xmath87 contains an integration on the whole cavity axis and its kernel is even . for these modes",
    "there is no coupling term between the cavity field and the condensate part [ see the first two rows of the matrix @xmath66 in ] , and , since damping of the modes comes from the cavity decay , these modes remain undamped and just marginally stable .",
    "consequently , if we want to describe the steady - state values of the correlations of fluctuations we have to omit those normal modes which do not couple to the radiation field ( assuming that they are initially not populated ) .      for further analysis we suppose that @xmath88 , i.e. the only potential in eq",

    "the nonclassical contribution of the photon number is plotted only for the cavity cooling regime , where a steady state solution exists .",

    "the lack of entanglement can be attributed to the big difference of the occupation of these modes . while the atom number was assumed to be in the order of @xmath258 , the photon number ranged in the order of unity .",
