    "the problem of phase transitions and ordering phenomena in adsorbed films on crystal surfaces has attracted considerable interest for many years ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "formation of ordered structures of particles adsorbed on surfaces due to mutual ( lateral ) interactions has been observed in many experiments , originating different types of adsorption isotherm @xcite .",
    "strong attractive ( lateral ) interactions lead to phase separation with different coverages , characteristic of first order phase transitions @xcite .",
    "it is well known experimentally that adsorption on surfaces is not only restricted to the formation of monolayers , but rather a second layer can condensate on the first one , a third on the second , and so on @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations also show similar results @xcite .",
    "the old bet theory @xcite considered the possibility of multilayer adsorption but , as it does not include interactions among particles in the same layer , does not yield either a phase transition or ordered structures .",
    "so far we are not aware of theoretical models to describe this situation . other theoretical forms for isotherm intended to describe such a multilayer adsorption phenomenon have been discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "however , such models do not seem to be able to describe phase transitions or pattern formation .",
    "the aim of the present work is to introduce a simple model that can describe multilayer adsorption qualitatively and the formation of ordered structures . to reach this goal",
    "we exploit a model introduced in ref.@xcite to describe a system of a monolayer of adsorbed particles with lateral attractive interactions leading to the formation of interfaces separating phases with different local coverage .",
    "the new aspect is that we extend such a model and go beyond the one layer system considering a multilayer system ( however , focusing on the case of only two layers ) including also an exchange interaction between different layers .",
    "it is worth remarking here that such a  macroscopic \" model can be derived from a microscopic one following a procedure similar to that used in @xcite .    in what follows",
    "we present the model , show the form of the isotherm , and discuss briefly some aspects of the critical point and the form of the density profiles of the possible fronts .",
    "finally we draw some conclusions .",
    "we adopt here a phenomenological point of view .",
    "however , a formal derivation of the macroscopic master equation leading us to the phenomenological equations we present here , is included in the appendix , where we start from a microscopic description closely following the procedure of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "we adopt a continuous description for the surface , and characterize the adsorptive species through evolution equations for @xmath0 , the local coverage in the @xmath1-th layer ( see the appendix for the precise definition of these local coverage ) .",
    "the adsorptive contribution is characterized by @xmath2 ( a constant ) , and the adsorption is only possible in the @xmath3 free sites of the corresponding layer .",
    "hence , the adsorption rate is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the partial pressure of the gaseous phase .",
    "additionally , for adsorption on the @xmath1-th layer , it is required to have free sites on the @xmath6-th layer .",
    "the desorption process has a rate @xmath7 , that includes @xmath8 , the desorption for noninteracting particles , and a correction due to the lateral interactions .",
    "the strong local bond induced by the interaction @xmath9 ( @xmath10 for the second layer , etc ) , corrects the desorption rate as : @xmath11 $ ] , where @xmath12 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath13 the temperature .",
    "according to the form we use to introduce such an interaction , we are assuming that it is a _ substratum mediated _ interaction .",
    "a desorption process in the first layer can happen only if the corresponding site on the second layer is free .",
    "the potential @xmath14 produces a force @xmath15 , that affects the adsorbed particles inducing a velocity @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the mobility ( given by einstein s relation @xmath18 , with @xmath19 the diffusion coefficient in the @xmath1-th layer ) .",
    "the associated particle flux is @xmath20 . because the flux is only possible at the @xmath21 free sites , its final form is @xmath22 while the diffusion flux is given by @xmath23 for the first and the second layer respectively .",
    "the possible transference interaction between different layers is characterized by a coupling parameter @xmath24 .",
    "it involves free sites in the final layer and occupied ones in the original layer .",
    "hence , the form of this contribution is @xmath25 for transfer from a given layer to the upper one , and similarly in other cases . in fig .",
    "1 we sketch the different processes entering into our model .    considering all the above , the evolution equations for the different coverage can be written as @xmath26 + c_1(1-c_2)k_t   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{\\partial } { \\partial x}[\\frac{d}{kt}\\frac{\\partial u_1(x)}{\\partial x } c_1(1-c_1)+d\\frac{\\partial c_1}{\\partial x } ] \\\\ \\frac{\\partial } { \\partial t}c_2(x , t)=k'_ap\\,c_1(1-c_2 ) & - & k'_{d,0}c_2 \\exp[u_2(x)/kt ] + k'_t c_2 ( 1-c_1 ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{\\partial } { \\partial x } [ \\frac{d}{kt}\\frac{\\partial u_2(x)}{\\partial x } c_2(1-c_2)+d\\frac{\\partial c_2}{\\partial x}].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    according to @xcite , we can employ the following simple approach . in thermal equilibrium",

    "two of them correspond to real solutions , with homogeneous coverage , while the intermediate region is bistable and presents a coexistence phase with intermediate coverages .",

    "this indicates that @xmath33 becomes relevant only after some threshold value of the coverage has been reached in the first layer .",
