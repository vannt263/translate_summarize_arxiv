    "suggest that el gordo is a high redhsift close analogue to the bullet cluster . in this scenario , as a consequence of the high infall velocity , the gas ( marked by the x - ray peak ) trails the dark matter associated with the infalling cluster ( marked by the peak of the galaxy number distribution ) due to ram pressure .",
    "however , this close analogy with the bullet cluster is questionable , because another mass proxy , the peak of the @xmath20-band luminosity and the mass peak of the infalling cluster from weak lensing @xcite are , in fact , trailing the x - ray peak .",

    "@xcite estimated the probability to find a cluster with the mass and the redshift of el gordo based on cosmological numerical simulations using the exclusion curve method of @xcite , and concluded that , although a cluster such as el gordo is a rare massive cluster , it is within the allowed mass range predicted by the @xmath5cdm  models .",
    "however , @xcite noted that a more accurate mass measurement may put el gordo into the excluded region .",
    "the discovery of the bullet cluster with its high inferred infall velocity provided the first challenge to the concordance @xmath5cdm  model @xcite .",
    "estimates based on cosmological simulations found that the probability of finding a cluster with the infall velocity implied by the bullet cluster is very unlikely @xcite .",
    "@xcite used cosmological simulations with different box sizes ( 0.252 h@xmath12 gpc ) to improve the accuracy of the probability distribution at the high end of the velocity tail taking into account the effect of the box size .",

    "the most probable infall velocity was found to be about 550 @xmath2 , ( see figure 15 of @xcite ) .",
    "most recently @xcite carried out a simulation using large box size ( 6 h@xmath12 gpc ) to improve on the statistics of large clusters and rare cosmological events .",
    "they found no merging system with the same large relative velocity , spatial separation , and redshift as the bullet cluster ( see their figure 7 ) .",
    "they conclude , however , that this might be due to their low statistics of these rare major mergers at a fixed redshift .",
    "clearly , more numerical work is necessary to quantify the probability distribution of relative velocities of mergers as a function of redshift , masses , and distances between the components .    since the discovery of the bullet cluster several other merging clusters have been found with large offsets between the x - ray peak and the sz and dark matter surface density peaks ( macs j0025.4 - 1222 : @xcite ; cl j0152 - 1347 : @xcite ; a2163 : @xcite ; macs j0744.8 + 3927  and cl j1226.9 + 3332 : @xcite ; macs j0717.5 + 3745 : @xcite ; dlscl j0916.2 + 2951 : @xcite ; sl2s j08544 - 0121 : @xcite ) .",
    "these offsets are generated by the different behavior of the collisionless component , the dark matter , and the gas during the merging process : the dark matter responds only to gravity , but the gas is subject to hydrodynamical effects , and that the x - ray emission and the sz effect depend differently on the gas density and temperature .",
    "the size of the offsets between the dark matter and the gas peaks is determined by the relative strength of the gravitational force which is trying to keep the gas locked into the potential well of the dark matter , and the ram pressure which is removing gas from the infalling subcluster . using n / body  hydrodynamical simulations of merging galaxy clusters , @xcite showed that a large impact velocity is necessary to explain hundreds of kpc scale offsets .",
    "the relative velocity of el gordo was estimated by @xcite from the measured line - of - sight peculiar velocity difference between the se and nw galaxy concentrations , as 586@xmath2996 @xmath2 . however , for the bcg , they found a higher velocity difference : 731@xmath2966 @xmath2 . assuming a projection angle relative to the plane of the sky of @xmath30 , the relative velocity can be expressed as 586/@xmath31 .",
    "based on the x - ray morphology , menanteau et al .",
    "argue that @xmath30 should be small , and they obtain a relative velocity of 2300 @xmath2  and 1200 @xmath2  assuming 15@xmath16  and 30@xmath16  for @xmath30 , and use this to estimate the infall velocity .",
    "the location of radio relics ahead and behind the two mass centers enclosed by the detected x - ray emission support this interpretation @xcite .",
    "these estimated infall velocity values fall on the less likely to the unlikely region of the velocity probability distribution derived by @xcite .",
    "menanteau et al .",
    "conclude that a more accurate determination of the infall velocity is necessary for el gordo using numerical simulations to find out wether it is allowed by the concordance @xmath5cdm  model .    binary merger simulations to reproduce the observed properties of el gordo using a publicly available smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code gadget-3 ( springel 2005 ; dolag & stasyszyn 2009 ) was carried out by @xcite .",

    "@xcite reproduced the x - ray luminosity of el gordo and the observed distances between the peaks of the dark matter surface density distribution and x - ray emission and sz effect .",
    "however , the x - ray morphology has not been reproduced well : the leading x - ray peak followed only by one tail close to the collision axis ( the line connecting the two dark matter centers ) .",
    "donnert is suggesting that the reason why the two - tailed x - ray morphology was not reproduced was the lack of substructure in the simulation .",

    "we find that the phases of the collision for these massive clusters with large infall velocities ( @xmath62000 @xmath2 ) and small mass ratios are the following : first a large scale contact discontinuity forms when the gas of the infalling cluster presses against that of the main cluster .",
    "as the infalling cluster plunges into the main cluster , adiabatically compressed layers of gas develop in both components around the contact discontinuity , and form a wedge - shaped region , and a shock develops on the two sides of the contact discontinuity .",
    "this wedge - shaped contact discontinuity passes through the main cluster and visible after the first core passage as well ( upper row , first panel in figure  [ f : xrimages ] ) .",
    "however , in the case of el gordo , due to an impact parameter in the order of a few hundred kpc , and a high infall velocity , only one side of the wedge - shaped region is visible in the x - ray image , because there is not enough gas on the side of the collision to produce a visible signal ( e.g. , first row 3rd , 4th panel in figure  [ f : xrimages ] ) .",
    "after the first core passage , a bow shock forms in the main cluster gas ahead of the contact discontinuity as the infalling cluster makes its way outward from the main cluster ( clearly visible in all panels of figure  [ f : xrimages ] ) .",
    "this is the same phase as that of the bullet cluster . at this stage of the collision ,",
    "tidally stretched gas produces the x - ray emission that connects the two mass centers , seen as the northern x - ray tail in the wake of el gordo .",
    "this kind of tail can always be seen in simulations with smaller infall velocities , because in this case the gravitational force of the main cluster can retain enough gas to produce visible x - ray emission . in our simulated x - ray images",
    "there is a hint of a third tail , above the tidally stretched gas , which is due to the compressed gas on that side of the collision axis .",
    "the x - ray emission observed in el gordo suggests the presence of a possible third tail , indicated by enhanced emission to the north - west of the x - ray peak .",
    "however , the photon counts are quite low in this direction .",
    "our simulations suggest that a third x - ray tail above the two observed tails would be visible in an x - ray image of el gordo with a longer exposure time .",
    "we have demonstrated that the observed cometary x - ray morphology and system size of el gordo can be reproduced by our simulations using several infall velocities and impact parameters values ( figure  [ f : xrimages ] ) . as a next step ,",
    "we use the observed projected distance between the two dark matter centers and the observed relative radial velocity of the infalling cluster to constrain the initial parameters of the system .",
    "the mass center of the main ( nw ) component marked by the rest frame @xmath20-band and 3.6  @xmath21 m luminosity density , stellar mass density @xcite , and mass surface density derived from gravitational lensing @xcite are all very close to each other , so they seem to be reliable . on the other hand ,",
    "the position of the mass peak of the infalling cluster , the se component , derived using different methods show about a 170 kpc scatter around the x - ray peak .",
    "since our simulations suggest that the x - ray peak and the mass peak of the infalling cluster should be close , we adopt the position of the x - ray peak as the center of the infalling cluster .",
    "thus we demand that the projected distance between the centers of the two components in our merging simulations to be @xmath103860 kpc .",
    "based on galaxy redshift measurements , the observed relative radial ( los ) velocity between the infalling cluster center and the main component was found to be 586@xmath2996 @xmath2   @xcite .",
    "however , the observed radial velocity of the bcg was 731@xmath2966 @xmath2 , so we may assume that the radial relative velocity in el gordo falls in the interval of 500800 @xmath2 .",
    "the projected distances between the mass centers and the relative radial velocities for our simulations are listed in table  [ t : table1 ] ( columns 6 and 7 ) . based on this table ,",
    "we conclude , that simulations with an infall velocity of @xmath110 @xmath2  and impact parameters @xmath111 , 300 , and 350 kpc ( runs r2p20v22 , r3p30v22 , and r4p35v22 ) , and @xmath112 @xmath2  and @xmath113 kpc ( run r5p25v20 ) provide a good match with the x - ray morphology , the positions of the x - ray peak and mass peaks , and the constraints from the observed radial relative velocity .",
    "we can exclude run r1p05v22 , because it has three tails due to the small impact parameter of @xmath114 kpc ( we included only for comparison with the simulation carried out by @xcite for el gordo ) . in general we can exclude simulations with small impact parameters because they produce either one or three tails depending on the infall velocities .",
    "runs r6p25v25 , r7p25v30 , and r9p20v25 can be excluded as well , because these simulations with larger infall velocities produce either too large projected distances between the two mass centers , or too large radial velocities . in figure",
    "[ f : xrayszdmcont ] we show the x - ray surface brightness , sz and mass surface density contours for these simulations ( runs r2p20v22 , r3p30v22 , r4p35v22 , and r5p25v20 ) in the same projection as in figure  [ f : xrimages ] ( see table  [ t : table1 ] for the parameters ) .",
    "all four contour images show similar morphology .",
    "the x - ray and mass contours show that the mass centers of the `` bullet '' coincide with the x - ray peak . at these assumed infall velocities , unlike in the case of the bullet cluster , the ram pressure is not sufficient to drag the gas behind the dark matter component as it passes through the main cluster gas cloud .",
    "thus our simulations predict that we will not find an offset between the x - ray peak and the mass center of the `` bullet '' using more precise observations . on each image , the mass center of the main cluster",
    "is located at the north - western end of the northern tail , as predicted by observations .",
    "we further constrain the infall velocity and the impact parameter of the collision for el gordo comparing the shapes of our x - ray surface brightness profiles across the wake with that from chandra  observations ( figure 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "the observed profile is nearly symmetric with two maxima separated by about 35@xmath104 , and a local minimum between them .",
    "first , we went through different snapshots for each run after the first core passage with a separation between the two dark matter centers of 6001200 kpc , and generated x - ray images by projecting them out with a set of different polar and roll angles on a grid , and kept those snapshots and projections which resembled el gordo ( showed a cometary morphology with one peak x - ray emission and two tails in the wake of the infalling cluster ) . as a next step , we extracted x - ray surface brightness profiles along cuts through the wake with different positions and rotation angles , and found the best fits to the chandra  data .",

    "our best result with an infall velocity of 2250 @xmath2  ( run r4p35v22 ) is in a good agreement with their prediction , however this is a coincidence .",
    "the relative velocity of this run at the phase of best fit with observations is 1009 @xmath2 .",
    "this shows that the instantaneous velocity at a phase after the first core passage could be 50% of the infall velocity ( or it could even be zero at the phase of the turnaround ) .",

    "[ f : xraycomp ] ]    @xcite carried out simulations to reproduce the observed properties of el gordo .",
    "most of the important initial conditions adopted were similar to ours ( we also based our simulations on the results of @xcite ) : large masses and the core radius for the main component : m@xmath123 @xmath4 , m@xmath124 @xmath4 , @xmath47 = 300 kpc , infall velocity : 2600 @xmath2 . however , the impact parameter , the concentration parameters , @xmath38 , and the core radius of the infalling cluster were significantly smaller than ours : 20 kpc , @xmath125  =  2.9 , @xmath126  =  3.2 , @xmath38 = 2/3 , @xmath48 = 25 kpc , as well as @xmath38  =  2/3 , and the initial distance , which does not affect the results , larger : 5231  kpc .",
    "donnert used a hernquist profile @xcite for the distribution of dark matter without a cut off at the virial radius , but since the density profile of this model falls off as @xmath127 , the density is quite low at large radii , whereas we used a truncated nfw profile with zero density at large radii .",
    "this difference should not have any significant effect on neither the dynamics of the collision nor the observable x - ray emission around the first core passage .",
    "donnert s simulations reproduced the x - ray luminosity of el gordo , the distances between peaks of the x - ray emission , sz signal and the mass surface density well .",
    "however , the x - ray morphology was not reproduced correctly : the cometary structure showed only one tail pointing to the center of the mass distribution of the main cluster .",
    "our simulations were able to reproduce the two x - ray tails with a range of infall velocities ( 20003000 @xmath2 ) and impact parameters ( 200350 kpc ) .",
    "turbulence plays an important role in structure formation , it facilitates the mixing of the intracluster gas during cluster merging .",
    "comparisons between sph and eulerian amr codes suggest that artificial viscosity , necessary in sph codes to handle shocks , suppress dynamical instabilities , and thus turbulent mixing of the gas ( mitchell et al . 2009 ; agertz et al .",
    "2007 ) . therefore ,",
    "as opposed to donnert , we chose to use an amr code for our merging cluster simulations .",
    "however , the main physical process which produces ordered large scale shock - heated and compressed gas is more likely linked to formation of contact discontinuities and not to turbulence .    in figure  [",

    "these images show a similar symmetric morphology to that of donnert , who used @xmath130 @xmath2  and @xmath131 kpc .",
    "we may conclude that even an impact parameter of 50 or 100 kpc would not break the symmetry of the x - ray images significantly , and can not produce the asymmetric two - tail morphology of el gordo . in both of these panels of figure",
    "[ f : xraycomp ] , three tails can be seen , a larger tail in the middle and two fainter tails in a wedge shape pointing towards the bullet .",
    "our simulations suggest that the one tail seen in the wake of donnert s simulation is due to the tidally stretched gas between the two mass centers .",
    "a similar wedge - shaped structure is generated in donnert s simulation , but it disappears after the first core passage ( figure 5 of @xcite ) .",
    "we speculate that donnert s simulation with a small impact parameter produced only one x - ray tail and not three since they assumed the infalling cluster is in a bubble inside the main cluster atmosphere .",
    "this causes their contact discontinuity to form only between the two cores and not on a large scale of the entire cluster , as in our simulations @xcite . in our simulations , we needed impact parameters of a few 100 kpc to produce two asymmetric x - ray tails .",
    "we note that our simulation , r8p10v25 , with the same infall velocity , 2500 @xmath2 , used by donnert and with a small impact parameter , predicts a relative radial velocity of 1000 @xmath2 , much larger than observed ( table  [ t : table1 ] ) .",
    "using self - consistent n - body / hydrodynamical simulations we confirm the previous interpretation of el gordo , as a massive galaxy cluster in an early stage of merging , about 480 million years after a first core passage , well before the first turn around .",
    "we have used the x - ray morphology , sz , gravitational lensing and radio observations of el gordo to constrain the initial conditions of this merging system .",
    "we have found that our simulations within a relatively narrow range of infall velocities and impact parameters can reproduce the data well . in particular",
    ", we can reproduce the distinctive `` twin - tailed '' cometary x - ray morphology of el gordo with a simple clear physical explanation .",
    "we match the observations with an initial infall velocity of @xmath1 2250 @xmath2 , when the clusters are separated by the sum of their virial radii .",
    "the impact parameter of the collision is well constrained at @xmath1300 kpc to provide the asymmetric second tail which is a projection of the compressed and shock heated gas front .",
    "we quantify this using the profile of the x - ray surface brightness across the wake @xcite , by the relative radial velocity from spectroscopy of member galaxies , and from the relative positions of the x - ray , sz and mass peaks .",
    "note that our best simulation does reconstruct all the observed morphological features of el gordo , as well as the x - ray surface brightness across the wake quantitatively , but the position of the extraction region through the wake is not an exact match with that of the chandra  observations .",
    "therefore , for a more accurate determination of the infall velocity , we need to perform a search in a larger parameter space including the masses of the components , their concentration parameters , core radii for the intracluster gas .",
    "this task necessitates many more simulations , which we defer to a future study .",
    "this massive merging cluster with an infall velocity of 2250  @xmath2  at the the time the universe was half of its age ( at the redshift of @xmath8 ) is apparently very unusual in the standard @xmath5cdm  models , for which extensive simulations have been performed to determine the expected probability distribution of relative velocities @xcite . at face value , such extreme cases present a challenge to our understanding of structure formation and may lead to a better understanding of dark matter and/or alternative theories of gravity .",
    "we aim to expand our grid of input parameters for a fuller investigation of the uniqueness of our solution and the uncertainties on the derived physical parameters using more powerful gpu accelerated architectures .",
    "we will also benefit from deeper x - ray observations and higher resolution sz imaging to more accurately constrain our models .",
    "this work will become increasingly more important for cosmology as new discoveries of extreme cluster collisions are uncovered in the new wide area sz surveys sensitive to high pressure shocked gas and also from future radio surveys sensitive to `` relic '' radio emission from merger shocks .",
