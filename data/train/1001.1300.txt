    "the investigation of antikaon ( strangeness @xmath1 ) interactions with nucleons and nuclei has a long and interesting history based on early observations that the isospin @xmath2 s - wave @xmath3 is quite strongly attractive around and below @xmath3 threshold , unlike the weakly repulsive kaon - nucleon ( @xmath4 ) interaction .",
    "the frame for this is chiral su(3 ) effective field theory , the low - energy realization of qcd with strange quarks .",
    "this theory uniquely identifies the tomozawa - weinberg ( tw ) terms as the driving sources of the low - energy @xmath3 interaction .",
    "for example , the tw interaction hamiltonian in the @xmath5 elasic channel at zero three - momentum is    @xmath6    where @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the kaon and proton fields .",
    "the @xmath9 interaction is half as strong . the coupling strength to this order",
    "is solely determined by the pseudoscalar decay constant , @xmath10 gev .",
    "note that this interaction is proportional to the kaon energy .",
    "it vanishes in the chiral limit ( i.e. for vanishing quark masses ) and at zero kaon energy @xmath11 , as it should for a goldstone boson . explicit chiral symmetry breaking by the strange quark mass gives the charged kaon its observed mass , @xmath12 mev , the energy scale around which threshold @xmath3 physics takes place . at this energy scale",
    "the resulting isospin - zero s - wave @xmath3 force is indeed quite strongly attractive , resulting in a @xmath13-nuclear potential of order -100 mev at the center of heavy nuclei .",
    "while higher order terms in the low - energy expansion of the chiral effective lagrangian are not negligible , the tw term nonetheless dominates the @xmath3 s - wave .",
    "historically , ideas concerning @xmath13 condensation in neutron star matter @xcite started from this observation .",
    "calculations of the antikaon spectrum in dense nuclear matter @xcite display the expected attractive shift of the antikaon mass .",
    "such early calculations suggested that the in - medium @xmath0 mass shift , or binding energy , might reach 20 % of the vacuum kaon mass at normal nuclear matter density , while at the same time the @xmath14 decay width drops once the phase space for this process closes .",
    "exploratory studies for neutron star matter were performed in the same framework @xcite .",
    "such calculations suggested typical densities for ( anti)kaon condensation , at which the in - medium effective @xmath13 mass meets the electron chemical potential , around four times the density of normal nuclear matter .",
    "of course , the model dependence of such extrapolations to dense matter remained an issue ever since .",
    "the role of the @xmath15 absorption channels , producing hyperons rather than antikaonic modes in the ground state of the dense medium , needs still to be clarified quantitatively .",
    "refined calculations were performed , e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite , implementing partial self - consistency for the in - medium @xmath0 propagator .",
    "the data base and phenomenology of kaonic atoms was systematically investigated to set empirical constraints on the attractive @xmath13-nuclear forces @xcite . while the qualitative consensus about the attractive nature of antikaon - nuclear forces is without doubt",
    ", quantitative predictions about the far - subthreshold properties of this interaction are still unavoidably vague and will presumably remain so until fully conclusive experimental data can be used to set more stringent constraints .",
    "the present report attempts to give a state - of - the - art picture of recent theoretical developments .",
    "reports on the experimental status are found elsewhere in these proceedings @xcite .",
    "the chiral su(3 ) meson - baryon effective lagrangian is the appropriate starting point for a systematic construction of leading low - energy @xmath3 interaction terms .",
    "however , chiral perturbation theory is not applicable in the sector with baryon number @xmath16 and strangeness @xmath1 .",
    "the reason is the formation of the @xmath17 at less than 30 mev below @xmath18 threshold .",
    "the strong decay of the @xmath17 into @xmath19 immediately implies a coupled - channels problem that must be solved to all orders .",
    "this was recognized already long ago by r. dalitz and collaborators @xcite .",
    "they were the first to suggest that the @xmath17 is not a simple three - quark baryon but rather a @xmath3 quasibound state embedded in the @xmath19 continuum .",
    "the contemporary framework to approach this physics is chiral su(3 ) dynamics @xcite .",
    "it combines the non - perturbative coupled - channels method with input from the chiral su(3 ) lagrangian ,    @xmath20 ,    that involves the pseudoscalar meson octet fields @xmath21 interacting with the baryon octet @xmath22 .",
    "leading derivative couplings proportional to @xmath23 are completely determined by chiral symmetry .",
    "next - to - leading order terms come with additional low - energy constants that need to be fixed by comparison with experiment .",
    "explicit chiral symmetry breaking is incorporated through meson ( or quark ) mass terms .",
    "the chiral su(3 ) coupled - channels approach has been applied successfully to describe threshold @xmath3 physics including the @xmath18 scattering length and branching ratios .",
    "it explains the @xmath17 is an i = 0 quasibound state emerging from the coupling between the @xmath3 and @xmath19 channels .",
    "the chiral interactions that enter the coupled channel matrix are quite strongly attractive in both the diagonal @xmath3 and @xmath19 channels .",
    "the non - diagonal @xmath24 couplings are also strong and must be treated accordingly .",
    "_ the two - poles scenario_. in the absence of channel couplings , the attraction from the tw matrix elements acting separately in the @xmath3 channels is sufficient to produce a @xmath3 bound state with isospin @xmath2 in a narrow window just below @xmath18 threshold ( @xmath25 mev ) and above @xmath26 mev .",
    "at the same time , the attraction in the i = 0 @xmath19 channel is sufficient to produce an s - wave resonance around @xmath27 mev , i.e. about 60 mev above the @xmath19 threshold , with a large width of about 200 mev .",

    "the @xmath19 resonance itself moves slightly upward in energy and reduces its width to 100 - 150 mev .",
    "this two - poles scenario @xcite implies that the @xmath17 is not a simple bound state but must be seen as emerging from the complex interplay of these strongly coupled channels .",
    "while the maximum of the @xmath19 invariant mass spectrum , commonly identified with the @xmath17 , is indeed located around 1405 mev , this does not mean that the same maximum is to be found in the imaginary part of the ( not directly observable ) @xmath3 subthreshold amplitude .",

    "although the amplitudes derived from both interactions roughly agree , by construction , in the vicinity of the @xmath3 threshold , the effective interaction deduced from chiral su(3 ) dynamics turns out to be far less attractive than the ay potential in the deep subthreshold region .",

    "it has been pointed out @xcite that , enforcing agreement with the dear threshold data , these resulting mass distributions would differ from those constrained only by scattering data and threshold branching ratios .",

    "cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the wide range of theoretical binding energies reflects on one hand the uncertainties encountered in the subthreshold extrapolations of the @xmath3 interaction . on the other hand , both types of calculations , variational or faddeev , have their intrinsic limitations .",
    "variational calculations use effective @xmath3 interactions in which the @xmath19 channels are eliminated and their effects are relegated to the non - locality and energy dependence of the off - shell @xmath3 two - body amplitude . but",
    "this procedure does not account for specific features of the full three - body @xmath60 coupled - channels problem .",
    "this is handled correctly in the faddeev approach . as pointed out in ref.@xcite , proper treatment of the @xmath54 intermediate state , including the recoiling spectator nucleon as it accompanies the @xmath19 subsystem , enhances the binding in the three - body system .",
    "this may explain the difference between the variational results of ref.@xcite ( the ones constrained by chiral su(3 ) dynamics ) and the faddeev calculations ( of which @xcite also use chiral su(3 ) input ) . in principle",
    "the faddeev method is indeed superior to the variational approach in dealing with the full three - body @xmath51 dynamics . on the other hand , solving the three - body equations in practice involves a separable approximation for the basic two - body interactions .",
    "while sufficiently many terms are used in the separable expansion of the @xmath61 interaction , the driving @xmath3 interaction is commonly approximated just by a one - term separable form .",
    "this may be a source of uncertainty in off - shell extensions of the relevant amplitudes .",
    "as mentioned , additional broadening of the @xmath50 quasibound state is expected to come from @xmath0 absorption procsses on two nucleons leading to hyperon - nucleon pairs .",

    "for the @xmath50 quasibound state with its lower density , a simpler estimate @xcite points to a corresponding added width of @xmath64 mev . in any case , the lifetime of the @xmath50 state , if existent , is expected to be very short .",
    "several exploratory studies have been performed investigating antikaon - nuclear binding in heavier nuclei .",
    "one such approach solves the klein - gordan equation with a @xmath0-nuclear complex potential based on chiral su(3 ) dynamics and including pauli plus short - range nn correlations @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach uses relativistic mean field theory with nucleons , scalar - vector mean fields and kaons as a framework for self - consistent calculations of antikaonic nuclei with one or more @xmath13 bound to the nuclear core @xcite .",
    "binding energies in such systems can reach 100 mev and beyond , but always accompanied by large widths , larger than 50 mev , once @xmath13 absorption on two nucleons is taken into account @xcite .",
    "an interesting question concerns possible enhancements of binding effects for multi - antikaonic nuclei .",
    "the investigations of ref.@xcite with inclusion of hyperons show however that there is saturation with increasing kaon number , making kaon condensation in dense matter unlikely .",
    "high - precision @xmath3 threshold data and accurate @xmath19 mass spectra are crucial in order to constrain subthreshold extrapolations of the antikaon - nucleon interaction into domains relevant for possible @xmath0-nuclear quasibound states . establishing improved @xmath2 and @xmath43 @xmath3 scattering lengths is a step of prime importance in this context .",
    "a necessary ( though not sufficient ) condition for reliable subthreshold extrapolations is a controlled theoretical framework .",
    "chiral su(3 ) effective field theory combined with coupled - channel methods provides such a framework , but it requires a sufficiently large and accurate empirical data base in order to proceed .",
    "while unambiguous conclusions about quasibound antikaon - nuclear systems can at present not yet be drawn , further progress is expected to come from detailed investigations of exclusive final states following @xmath13 absorption and photon- or hadron - induced @xmath65 production on nuclei , in order to constrain the underlying coupled - channel dynamics .",
