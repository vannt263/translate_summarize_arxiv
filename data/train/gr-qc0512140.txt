    "this description of the universe may contain finite - time future singularity , accompanied with divergence of dark energy density , called big rip @xcite . depending on the phantom potential , this model may also lead to universes expanding for ever , e.g. , universe tending to a de sitter space time @xcite . the effects of gravitational back - reactions can also counteract that of phantom energy and can become large enough to terminate the phantom dominated phase before the big rip @xcite .",

    "gsl asserts that the sum of the horizon entropy , and the normal entropy of the fluid is an increasing function of time . in @xcite",
    "the change in event - horizon area in cosmological models that depart slightly from de sitter space was investigated , and it was shown that the area and consequently the ( de sitter ) horizon entropy are non decreasing functions of time . in the presence of a viscous fluid , there was found that gsl was satisfied provided that the temperature of the fluid was equal to or lower than de sitter horizon temperature , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the hubble parameter . in @xcite the gsl for two specific examples of phantom dominated universe was discussed . in the first example",
    "it was shown that for a time independent parameter of state , the total entropy is a constant . in the second example using a power law potential and the slow climb approximation , it was shown that gsl was satisfied . in the absence of",
    "a well defined hawking temperature for cosmological horizon , the temperature of the phantom fluid in @xcite was assumed to be the same as the de sitter temperature .",
    "the phantom universe , has a future event horizon ( cosmological horizon ) , @xmath7 . in this model",
    "the hubble parameter is an increasing function of time so we expect that the horizon entropy , in contrast to the model discussed in @xcite , decreases with time .    in this paper",
    "we consider the phantom dominated era , and prove that the future event horizon area is a non - increasing function of time .",
    "it is shown that one necessary condition for satisfying gsl is the positivity of the temperature .",
    "if the temperature is assumed to be proportional to the de sitter temperature @xcite @xmath8 an inequality in terms of hubble parameter , @xmath6 , the future event horizon , @xmath7 , and the parameter @xmath9 , will be obtained .",

    "we also study the condition of validity of gsl in the transition from quintessence regime to the phantom dominated era . at the end",

    "the corresponding cosmological fluid is then consisted of some sort of energy density which has a negative pressure known as dark energy .",
    "matter with @xmath2 is dubbed phantom energy . by considering ( [ 5 ] )",
    ", one can see that for phantom fluid : @xmath24 , which using ( [ 3 ] ) results @xmath25 .",
    "there are various approaches to study the dark energy .",
    "one approach is introducing scalar fields .",
    "the behavior of @xmath0 in the phantom regime , @xmath2 , can be related to the presence of a phantom scalar field , @xmath26 , with a wrong sign kinetic term @xcite . depending on the form of the phantom scalar field potential , different solutions such as asymptotic de sitter , big rip , and so on",
    "may be obtained @xcite . to describe @xmath27 , or quintessence regime , a normal scalar field , @xmath28 , known as quintessence scalar field ,",
    "can be used @xcite .",
    "the phase transitions in inflationary models can be investigated using hybrid models .",
    "these models , at least , are composed of two scalar fields @xcite , e.g. , one of these models is the quintom model which in order to describe the transition from @xmath27 to @xmath2 regime , assumes that the cosmological fluid , besides the ordinary matter and radiation , is consisted of a quintessence and a phantom scalar field @xcite .",
    "another method to study the acceleration of the universe is to use a running cosmological constant based on the principles of quantum field theory ( specially on the renormalization group ) which can mimic the behavior expected for quintessence and phantom -like representations of the dark energy . in this method despite of the absence of scalar fields , an effective equation state like ( [ 5 ] ) can be obtained @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will use the equations ( [ 3 ] ) , ( [ 5 ] ) , and assume that the universe is filled with a perfect fluid in phantom phase in the sense that @xmath2 , but our results will be independent of the scalar fields or other origins of the phantom energy .    consider the era when phantom phase is dominated i.e , @xmath29 .",

    "this is in contrast to the assumption of @xcite , upon which it was argued that the holographic dark energy has no phantom - like behavior .",
    "the entropy of the phantom fluid inside the cosmological horizon of a comoving observer is related to the energy and the pressure via the first law of thermodynamics @xmath53 in terms of @xmath6 this law can be written as @xmath54 using @xmath55 and @xmath56 , we obtain @xmath57 then using ( [ 7 ] ) , we arrive at @xmath58 for phantom fluid @xmath29 , @xmath59 , provided we take @xmath60 . gsl states that the sum of the ordinary entropy and the horizon entropy can not decrease with time @xmath61 in our model this law yields @xmath62    note that in phantom regime , @xmath29 and @xmath63 , so , a necessary condition that the gsl to be satisfied is positivity of the phantom fluid temperature @xmath60 .",
    "therefore the gsl is violated in phantom models with positive entropy and negative temperature @xcite . for a discussion about this subject see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the gsl asserts that the entropy of an isolated system can not decrease , but does not determine the sign of the entropy .",

    "when @xmath65 ) we have @xmath66 @xcite , and the gsl is assumed to be satisfied in an era before @xmath32 , then the entropy will be negative in this epoch , which agrees to @xcite and @xcite in which a negative entropy for a specific model of phantom thermodynamics with positive temperature has been derived .",
    "however in the above mentioned papers i.e. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , the role of the future event horizon has been ignored .",
    "if the temperature is taken to be @xmath67 , gsl results @xmath68 for a de sitter space - time @xmath69 , which results @xmath70 , so we expect that in a phantom model which is small perturbed around de sitter space the fluid temperature is equal to or less than the de sitter temperature .",
    "if the total entropy is increasing in the universe expansion , @xmath71 equation ( [ 19 ] ) results @xmath72 for @xmath73 , we must have @xmath74 , or using ( [ 7 ] ) @xmath75 here @xmath76 is an increasing negative function of time .",

    "now let us assume that the expansion of the universe is a reversible adiabatic process such that @xmath79 from ( [ 19 ] ) we obtain @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a constant . for @xmath73 , using ( [ 7 ] ) , this results @xmath82 and using the fact that @xmath83 , for @xmath84 , we obtain @xmath85 note that @xmath63 , therefore @xmath86 .",

    ", one can consider the possibility of the transition from @xmath27 to @xmath2 .",
    "so it may be interesting to see how our results may be restricted , if the gsl still hold in the transition epoch . by transition epoch",
    "we mean a little neighborhood around the transition time : @xmath99 . like the phantom universe , for a quintessence universe we can consider the cosmological event horizon via ( [ 6 ] ) .",

    ", we deduce that a necessary condition for satisfying gsl in such universe is @xmath101 .",
    "but in the phantom universe , @xmath7 is non - increasing .",

    "if the entropy is taken to be negative in the beginning of phantom dominated era ( which is not a consequence of gsl which considers only the time derivative of the entropy ) and the gsl is assumed to be valid in the transition epoch , then we must have a negative entropy in the quintessence era too .",
    "to illustrate our general results , let us consider two examples . as a first example consider the phantom universe of pole - like type @xmath107 @xmath108 and @xmath109 is a positive real number .",

    "we can only claim that in the period @xmath173 , ( in an interval before the big rip)the gsl holds .",

    "expanding of digamma functions , the above equation , ( [ 42 ] ) , becomes @xmath183 which is valid for large @xmath117 .",
    "therefore for large @xmath117 , the gsl may be true in the transition epoch .",
    "the condition ( [ 38 ] ) , in a short time before the transition : @xmath184 , becomes @xmath185 which based on our previous discussion about the enough condition for validity of gsl , is correct for large @xmath117 .",

    "in this paper we discussed the constraints and conditions imposed on cosmological future horizon @xmath7 , hubble parameter @xmath6 , and the temperature @xmath186 , in a phantom dominated universe in order to satisfy the gsl .",
    "we proved that the future event horizon is a non - increasing function(see the theorem after eq.([7 ] ) ) and thereby the corresponding horizon entropy is also a non - increasing function of comoving time . to obtain this result we assumed that one can relate an entropy to the future cosmological horizon , in the same way as black - hole event horizons , despite their different structures @xcite .",
    "using the assumption that the ( super)accelerated universe is filled with a perfect fluid satisfying the first law of thermodynamics ( eq .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) ) , we obtained the total entropy and found that the positivity of the temperature is a necessary condition for gsl ( see eq.([18 ] ) ) .",
    "we obtained also an inequality in terms of @xmath7 , @xmath6 , and @xmath186 ( see eqs.([19 ] ) , ( [ 21 ] ) and ( [ 22 ] ) ) .",
    "this inequality becomes an equation for the adiabatic reversible expansion of the ( super ) accelerated universe .",
    "we solved this equation for @xmath7 , for de sitter and non - de sitter temperatures ( see eqs.([24 ] ) and ( [ 27 ] ) ) .",
    "we showed that in various cases @xmath186 must be less than or equal to de sitter temperature . by studying the influence of the transition from the quintessence to phantom dominated universe on the gsl",
    ", we deduced that the time derivative of the future event horizon and the entropy must be zero at the transition time . however if we adopt that the gsl is valid in the transition epoch and also assume that the entropy is negative in the beginning of the phantom era ( which is not a consequence of gsl ) , a negative entropy in the quintessence regime will be deduced , which is not expected .",
