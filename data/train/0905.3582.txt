    "when the epidemiologists at a public health agency detect a signal of an infectious disease outbreak , they rely heavily on mathematical models of disease transmission in estimating the rate of transmission , predicting the direction and speed of the spread , and figuring out an effective measure to contain the outbreak .",
    "many of the models formulate stochasticity and spatial heterogeneity , which are of great interest recently .",
    "the spatial heterogeneity ranges from the uneven probabilities of contacts between the individuals in communities @xcite , @xcite , dependence of the strength of the demographical interactions between cities on the distance @xcite , to nation - wide or world - wide inhomogeneous geographical structures @xcite , @xcite .    a monte - carlo stochastic simulation is widely used to understand the influence of the spatial heterogeneity on stochastic spreading .",
    "in such a simulation , accuracy and reproducibility of the input demographical knowledge such as the amount of traffic between cities have great impacts on the reliability of the output pattern of the movement of pathogens and their hosts . _ but , in studying world - wide epidemics , just a collection of regular airline routes and aircraft capacities does not always present the transportation network which results in the real chain of transmission .",
    "some routes are influential decisively , but the others are not .",
    "examples are found in the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) from asia to the world in 2003 .",
    "there were not any cases in japan in spite of the heavy traffic there from asian countries .",
    "many patients appeared in canada earlier than the united states to which airlines connect asian countries much more densely .",
    "here arises an interesting question .",
    "inversely , is it possible to learn the effectively decisive transportation network by observing how the disease spreads , reinforce the demographical knowledge on the network , and import the acquired knowledge into the mathematical model ?",
    "_ this is an inverse problem similar to the network tomography @xcite , @xcite .    in this study",
    ", a statistical method is presented to discover the effectively decisive topology of a heterogeneous network and reveal the parameters which govern stochastic transmission from a dataset on the early growth phase of the outbreak .",
    "the dataset consists of either the number of infectious persons or the number of new cases per an observation interval .",
    "the method is founded on a mathematical model for a stochastic reaction - diffusion process @xcite .",
    "the population in the model is described by a set of langevin equations .",
    "the equations are stochastic differential equations which include rapidly fluctuating and highly irregular functions of time .",
    "probability density functions and likelihood functions are derived from the equations analytically , and used for the maximal likelihood estimation of the topology and parameters .",
    "the method is tested with a number of computationally synthesized datasets and the world health organization ( who ) dataset on the sars outbreak in march through april in 2003 .",
    "the model in this study is a special case of a stochastic reaction - diffusion process .",
    "the model is a combination of standard epidemiological sir or sis compartment models and a meta - population network model . the meta - population network model @xcite sub - divides the entire population into distinct sub - populations in @xmath0 geographical regions .",
