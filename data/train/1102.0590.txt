    "the 6668.519  mhz @xmath3  a@xmath4 transition is the strongest and most widespread class ii methanol maser line @xcite .",
    "there is strong evidence that 6.7  ghz methanol masers trace very early evolutionary phases of high - mass star formation .",
    "for example , multi - wavelength studies of 6.7  ghz methanol masers have found their environment to be characteristic of massive protoclusters @xcite .",
    "moreover , recent work modeling the spectral energy distributions of the masers host sources have found them to be consistent with that of massive young stellar objects ( mysos ) undergoing rapid accretion @xcite .    however , the question where the maser emission originates relative to the myso is still the subject of considerable debate .",
    "early studies ( e.g. @xcite ) found a number of methanol masers to have linear or arched morphologies with monotonic velocity gradients across the spatial features .",
    "these were interpreted to be indicative of the masers originating in an edge - on circumstellar disk .",
    "however , the minimum mass for the central object derived from the disk hypothesis was found to be unrealistically high in some sources @xcite .",
    "in contrast , assuming that the linear maser distributions trace the full extent of such a disk , the enclosed mass was found to be much less than 1 m@xmath5 in a number of sources @xcite .",
    "this led to suggestions that the masers only trace partial disks around massive stars , or are associated with outflows or shock fronts .",
    "@xcite suggested that methanol masers originated behind a planar shock propagating through a star forming core in order to explain the observation of velocity gradients within individual spot clusters that were perpendicular to the main large scale velocity gradient across the linear morphology .",
    "high spatial resolution mid - infrared studies suggest that many methanol masers , including some with linear morphologies , are associated with outflows rather than being located in disks .",
    "while g35.200.74 is the best example of masers occurring along the walls of an outflow cavity @xcite , several other masers were found to have their linear morphologies aligned parallel to outflows @xcite . however , there are also sources such as ngc 7538 irs1 @xcite where there is strong evidence that masers originate in a disk .",
    "furthermore , in the recent study of the proper motions of 12.2  ghz methanol masers ( which are the second strongest class ii methanol masers ) in w3(oh ) , @xcite find that the linear distribution of the masers can be well fit with a flat rotating disk that is seen almost edge - on .",
    "since there is very good spatial correlation between the locations of 6.7 and 12.2  ghz methanol masers , this can be taken as evidence for a disk origin of some 6.7  ghz methanol masers .",
    "recent high resolution imaging of 6.7  ghz methanol masers with the european vlbi network ( evn ) revealed a number of masers to have ring shaped morphologies @xcite .",
    "the ring morphologies were modeled as an inclined disk or torus around a myso having expanding or infalling kinematics .",
    "in addition , a number of masers were found to be associated with sources that had excess emission measured in the 4.5 @xmath2 m irac band with the spitzer space telescope ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion of these sources called extended green objects or egos ) . taken together , this was interpreted as evidence for the origin of methanol maser emission in the interface region between a disk / torus and an outflow .",
    "one of the potential problems in very high angular resolution studies is that a significant fraction of the maser flux is resolved out .",
    "for example , @xcite found that a number of maser spots had a compact core and a more diffuse halo , while some spectral features had no detectable compact core .",
    "hence , lower angular resolution observations are required to determine the full extent and morphology of maser emission .",
    "it is also of interest to carry out this work towards a large and homogeneous sample from a blind survey .",
    "the most sensitive blind survey to date for 6.7  ghz methanol masers is the arecibo methanol maser galactic plane survey ( amgps ; @xcite , hereafter paper i ) .",
    "amgps detected 86 6.7  ghz methanol masers , of which 48 were new detections . taking into account the pointing accuracy of the arecibo telescope ,",
    "the uncertainty in the position of the amgps masers is @xmath6 at the 95% confidence level ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper ii hereafter ) .",
    "paper ii also presented an analysis of the properties of the masers including association with mid - infrared sources , a number of methanol masers were found to not have mid - infrared counterparts in the galactic plane survey using the midcourse source experiment ( msx ; @xcite ) .",
    "* paper iii hereafter ) presented the systemic velocities and distances to the sources ( all the distances used in this paper are taken from paper iii ) leading to the determination of the luminosity function of 6.7  ghz methanol masers . in this paper , we present accurate astrometry for the amgps sources using merlin and the expanded very large array ( evla ) .",
    "we also derive morphologies of the maser emission for the strong sources ( peak flux densities @xmath7  jy ) , and examine the association of methanol masers with mid - infrared sources found in recent sensitive surveys using the spitzer space telescope .",
    "the merlin observations of the amgps masers ( w51 main and g41.870.10 excluded ) were carried out between 2007 february and june using six antennas except for observations between march 5 and march 11 which employed only five antennas .",
    "two correlator configurations were used for the observations . in the wide - band mode ,",
    "two polarizations were observed with a total bandwidth of 16 mhz split into 32 channels with a channel width of 0.5 mhz . in the narrow - band mode ,",
    "two polarizations were observed with a bandwidth of 1 mhz split into 256 channels yielding a channel spacing of 3.9  khz .",
    "the primary and bandpass calibrator , 3c84 was observed in both wide and narrow - band modes .",
    "the phase calibrators ( see table  [ merlincalib ] ) were only observed in wide - band mode to achieve adequate signal to noise ratio , while the target sources were only observed in narrow - band mode .",
    "phase referencing was used with each scan on a target source being preceded and followed by a scan on a phase calibrator . to achieve good uv - coverage ,",
    "the target observing sequence was cycled through a group of sources with similar systemic velocities .",
    "no doppler tracking was used , and each group of targets was observed at a fixed frequency .",
    "this observing sequence was repeated several times over the course of each observing run which typically lasted for @xmath8 hours .",
    "the final integration time was roughly 45 minutes per source , with the resulting @xmath9 channel noise being @xmath10 mjy beam@xmath11 . at the adopted rest frequency of 6668.519 mhz for the maser transition ,",
    "the velocity resolution in the narrow - band mode is 0.18  km  s@xmath11 .",
    "the data were initially reduced using local merlin software @xcite . after initial editing and flux calibration on 3c84 , the data were converted into fits format with subsequent processing being carried out using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) package of nrao .",
    "the flux calibration was carried out assuming the flux density of 3c84 to be 14.5  jy in 2007 february , 15.0  jy in 2007 march , 15.5  jy in 2007 april , 16.0  jy in 2007 may , and 16.5  jy in 2007 june .",
    "the phases of 3c84 were calibrated in both the wide - band and narrow - band data , with the derived phase offset between the two data sets being used to transfer the calibration from the phase reference source ( which is only observed in the wide - band mode ) to the target sources ( which are only observed in the narrow - band mode ) .",
    "after calibration , the task `` cvel '' was used to shift the spectra to the systemic velocity with respect to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) and correct for the effects of earth s motion .",
    "the target spectra were then inspected followed by imaging the brightest channel to obtain the target astrometry .",
    "the typical beamsize was @xmath12 mas with a position angle of 20 .    as indicated in sect .",
    "2.3.1 of @xcite , the astrometric accuracy is limited by four factors  the accuracy of the phase calibrator position , accuracy in the positions of the individual antennas , accuracy in the transfer of phase solutions from the phase calibrator and targets ( on account of the atmosphere ) , and the precision with which the emission location can be determined given the beamsize . the phase calibrator positions indicated in table  [ merlincalib ] have position uncertainties between 0.4 and 4.4 milliarcseconds ( mas ) .",
    "the antenna positions have uncertainties of 12 cm , which results in a position uncertainty of @xmath8 mas .",
    "to determine the uncertainties from the phase transfer from the phase calibrator to the targets , we inspected the phase change over a timescale corresponding to the separation between the calibrator and target ( e.g. an angular separation of 3  corresponds to a 12 min timescale ) .",
    "we estimate positional uncertainties to be less than 10 mas , with median values of 6 mas .",
    "the last uncertainty from formal fitting errors is usually @xmath13 mas , and can usually be ignored . combining the various uncertainties",
    ", we estimate the absolute astrometric accuracy to be better than 15 mas .      among the 81 amgps masers targeted in the merlin observations ,",
    "30 sources were either not detected , or had bad data .",
    "after verification of the peak flux densities of these sources with the 100 m effelsberg telescope to check for variability , we observed 27 sources in 24 fields using the evla .",
    "the observations were carried out on 2008 october 16 and 18 in the a configuration . a single polarization ( rr )",
    "was recorded using the old vla correlator with a bandwidth of 1.56  mhz and 512 spectral channels .",
    "since the lower 0.5  mhz of the bandpass was unusable due to aliasing , this setup was required to achieve the highest possible spectral resolution along with the required velocity coverage .",
    "the resulting channel spacing was 3  khz giving a velocity resolution of 0.14  km  s@xmath11 at the rest frequency of the maser transition .",
    "each target source was observed in a single 10 minute or two 15 minute scans depending on its single dish flux density , with the resulting @xmath9 channel noise ranging from 20 to 35 mjy beam@xmath11 .",
    "the sky frequencies were computed for each individual scan and placed within the upper two - thirds of the 1.56 mhz bandwidth to ensure that no maser component would fall in the lower 0.5 mhz of the bandpass .",
    "the source j1331 + 305 ( 3c286 ) was used to set the absolute flux density scale , and the sources j1751 + 096 and j1925 + 211 as bandpass calibrators .",
    "the phase calibrators , used to calibrate the complex gains were j1851 + 005 , j1856 + 061 and j1922 + 155 ( table  [ evlacalib ] ) , with each calibrator being used for a subset of the target sources closest in angular distance .",
    "the editing , calibration , and processing of the data were carried out using aips . after the transfer of the complex gain calibration solutions to the target sources , the strongest emission channel in each source was imaged and its position measured followed by self - calibration ( when sufficient signal to noise was available ) in both phase and amplitude in an iterative cycle . in several cases ,",
    "multi - field imaging was necessary to account for strong 6.7  ghz methanol maser emission from other sources that fell within the primary beam of the 25 m evla antennas . in some weak sources ,",
    "multiple channels were smoothed in order to detect the source .",
    "the phase calibrators used in the evla observations have a position accuracy better than 3 mas ( table  [ evlacalib ] ) .",
    "the evla antenna positions are known to an accuracy of @xmath0 cm implying a position uncertainty of 55 mas . the uncertainty in the astrometry resulting from the transfer of phase solutions from the phase calibrator to the target ( obtained from examining the raw phases of the phase calibrator )",
    "is estimated to be less than 30 mas .",
    "in addition , some sources are only detected with moderate to poor signal to noise ratio , and consequently the formal fitting errors in determining the position of peak emission are as high as @xmath10 mas for these sources .",
    "thus , we estimate the absolute astrometry to be accurate to between 65 and 80 mas .",
    "to examine the relation between 6.7  ghz methanol masers and mid - infrared emission , we looked for 24  @xmath2 m counterparts in the spitzer mipsgal survey @xcite .",
    "since the 24  @xmath2 m point source catalog has not been released , we used the mosaiced images corrected for artifacts for this purpose .",
    "the strong interstellar dust emission in the galactic plane leads to complex backgrounds in the images , which can significantly affect the measurement of the positions of point sources .",
    "hence , we used a @xmath14 pixel median filter to subtract the background , as suggested in the mipsgal data reduction cookbook . the use of such aggressive filtering reduces the source flux to some extent . while this can be accounted for , we are primarily interested in the positions of the point sources in this work . hence , we do not derive flux densities of the 24  @xmath2 m counterparts .",
    "an additional complication arises from many regions being extremely bright and saturated in the mipsgal data . while some regions are completely blanked and other sources have the entire core of the point spread function ( psf ) blanked , there are some sources for which only the central few pixels are blanked .",
    "although the latter are rejected in the point source detection algorithm of mopex , there is sufficient information to measure the positions of these sources .",
    "hence , we measured the positions of all 24  @xmath2 m counterparts by gaussian fitting of the psf cores using the routine `` jmfit '' in aips . although the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the mips psf at 24  @xmath2 m is 5.9 , the high signal to noise ratio of the counterparts implies that the formal uncertainties in the gaussian fits are small , and that systematic errors dominate the uncertainties in the positions derived for the mipsgal counterparts .",
    "we were able to measure the absolute positions of 57 sources using merlin ( table  [ merlinpos ] ; positions of masers in w51 main were obtained using the data of @xcite ) and an additional 25 sources using the evla ( table  [ evlapos ] ) .",
    "we also identified two masers in the merlin data that were not in the original amgps catalog ( one of these sources was detected by @xcite ) .",
    "both sources are located close to other sources , leading them to be either missed or unresolved in the original survey .",
    "thus , this work has determined the absolute positions to 82 out of 88 amgps sources .",
    "point source counterparts at 24  @xmath2 m were found for 60 out of 82 sources .",
    "18 sources were either fully saturated or in the middle of a blanked region .",
    "another two sources was found to be in the middle of extended emission , while no counterparts were found for two sources .",
    "the positions of the 24  @xmath2 m point source counterparts are tabulated in table  [ mipspos ] , and comments about selected sources are included in sect . [ indisources ] .      although the absolute astrometric accuracy is limited by the factors described in sect .",
    "[ merlinobs ] and [ evlaobs ] , the relative astrometry between the emission distributions in different velocity channels can be determined to much higher precision . to this end",
    ", we imaged each source over the full velocity range of its emission , and measured the positions of the maser spots relative to the channel with peak emission .",
    "to improve the dynamic range in the data cubes , we self - calibrated data of targets that were sufficiently strong ( peak flux density @xmath7  jy ) .",
    "the measurement of spot positions in the data cube was automated using the aips task `` sad '' .",
    "to obtain reliable fits , we imposed a 6@xmath15 threshold on both the peak and integrated flux density to qualify as a maser spot .",
    "[ merlinspotmaps ] and [ evlaspotmaps ] show the results of this work for the merlin and evla data respectively . for each source ,",
    "the top panel shows the integrated spectrum , while the bottom panel shows the morphology of the maser spot emission as a function of both angular and physical distance .",
    "the coordinates listed in tables [ merlinpos ] and [ evlapos ] serve as reference coordinates for the spot maps",
    ". the lsr velocities of the maser spots are indicated next to the spots themselves .",
    "when a group of spots form a morphology with a monotonic velocity gradient , only the initial and final velocities are indicated at the ends of the feature . in cases where there is a compact cluster of spots , or where the spots form a morphology without a monotonic velocity gradient ,",
    "the velocity range of the cluster is indicated next to the feature .",
    "some sources observed with merlin are detected in three spots or fewer , from which no morphological information can be deduced .",
    "for these cases , only the integrated spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ merlinspectra ] .",
    "the evla data have much poorer resolution compared to the merlin data , and thus spot morphologies can be deduced only for the strong sources , or for sources that show a significant spatial extent of spot emission .",

    "the absolute position is consistent with that derived by @xcite although their poorer resolution fails to resolve individual spots in channels with multiple spots .",
    "the 24  @xmath2 m mipsgal image is saturated in the central pixels , and the overall morphology gives the appearance of two sources that are blended together . while table  [ mipspos ] gives the results of a single gaussian fit , higher resolution data is required to determine the presence or absence of multiplicity .",

    "moreover , the peak flux density detected in merlin is over 20  jy , while @xcite detect a peak flux density of only 9.7  jy .",

    "[ mipssephist ] shows the histogram of the angular physical separation between 6.7  ghz methanol masers and their 24  @xmath2 m counterparts for the 60 sources in table  [ mipspos ] .",
    "the median angular separation between a methanol maser and its 24  @xmath2 m counterpart is 0.9  and the corresponding physical separation is 7100 au .",
    "we also note that 18 sources had no counterpart identified due to detector saturation , and only four sources had no counterpart identified in the mipsgal data . of the four ,",
    "two were in regions of extended emission , and an additional source has a potential counterpart on the airy ring of a stronger source .",
    "hence , almost all 6.7  ghz methanol masers have associated mid - infrared emission .",
    "these results also show that the lack of counterparts in the msx galactic plane survey is primarily a result of poorer sensitivity and to a lesser extent the poorer resolution of the msx satellite .",
    "the 24  @xmath2 m point source fluxes of the methanol maser counterparts are frequently less than 1  jy ( see table  3 of @xcite ) which would be undetected by msx at 21 @xmath2 m , while the poorer resolution of msx would lead to significant confusion in some crowded fields .",
    "this close association of mid - infrared point sources associated with 6.7 ghz methanol masers is important in the context of theoretical models for the maser emission . for a wavelength of 24  @xmath2 m",
    ", the planck function has its maximum at 120 k , which is very close to the temperature of the molecular hot cores that the high mass protostellar objects exciting class ii methanol masers reside in .",
    "this wavelength is also close to that of one the main bands invoked in radiative class ii methanol maser pumping schemes ( excitation from the torsional ground state , @xmath38 to @xmath39 ; see @xcite ) .",
    "these two facts together , combined with the ubiquitous presence of 24  @xmath2 m sources apparently ensure extremely effective excitation of the masers .",
    "the work of @xcite found that masers with ring shaped and regular morphologies had strong 8  @xmath2 m emission .",
    "particularly , they found that no source that was saturated at 8  @xmath2 m had a complex morphology .",
    "while we have not inspected the 8  @xmath2 m images of the amgps sources , we do not see a similar clear correlation with the 24  @xmath2 m data .",
    "considering the 16 sources that were saturated at 24  @xmath2 m ( even if only in the central pixels ) and had morphologies determined , there were 5 linear / arched , 3 multiple , one compact and 7 complex sources . there is no statistically significant difference between the morphologies of masers associated with sources that are saturated at 24  @xmath2 m and that of the overall sample .",
    "however , further work is required to verify whether a similar trend is seen with the glimpse 8  @xmath2 m data .",
    "it is interesting to note that from fig .",
    "[ mipssephist ] , the separation between the maser and mid - infrared source does not peak at zero .",
    "this could arise either from the uncertainty in the absolute astrometry of mipsgal , or from astrophysical reasons underlying the location of the maser emission relative to the source of mid - infrared emission .",
    "@xcite analyze the relative positions of 24  @xmath2 m mipsgal point sources with those of 8  @xmath2 m counterparts in the glimpse point source catalog , and find the median astrometric offset between the mipsgal and glimpse to be 0.85 .",
    "this is very close to the median separation between methanol masers and mipsgal counterparts , and may be the likely explanation for this phenomenon .",
    "we have not undertaken the exercise of cross - correlating the maser positions with the glimpse catalog due to the presence of emission and absorption features from dust grains in some irac bands , which often leads to extended emission .",
    "moreover , it is clear from the work of @xcite that many infrared counterparts of methanol masers are also extended at 4.5 @xmath2 m .",
    "we thus reserve addressing the relation between glimpse point sources and the amgps masers for a future paper .",
    "however , the issue of whether or not there is a systematic offset between mid - infrared sources and methanol masers for astrophysical reasons can be resolved by high spatial resolution imaging from ground based facilities .",
    "an interesting consequence of the close correspondence between mipsgal 24  @xmath2 m point sources and methanol masers is that one can use the former to estimate positions for masers that have not been detected with an interferometer . in the amgps catalog ,",
    "there are six sources which are not detected , or havent been observed due to constraints of telescope time .",
    "since the 1@xmath15 uncertainty in the amgps position is 7 , we looked for 24  @xmath2 m point sources within 18  of each of the six sources . for five sources",
    ", there is a clear 24  @xmath2 m counterpart , while for g36.900.41 , there are two mipsgal point sources within 18  of the arecibo position .",
    "the coordinates of the 24  @xmath2 m sources are listed in table  [ otherpos ] .",
    "considering the statistics of the offset between mipsgal point sources and methanol masers , we suggest that these positions can be used to refine the single dish positions to an accuracy of @xmath40 .",
    "we have determined the absolute positions of 82 methanol masers in the region surveyed by the amgps including two sources that were not present in the original catalog .",
    "the median spatial extent along the major axis of maser emission is @xmath1  au .",
    "the spatial extent is correlated to both the velocity width of the maser and the maser luminosity though there is significant scatter in both relationships . among the 50 sources for which the morphologies of maser emission could be determined , 9 sources have a linear / arched morphology , 5 have compact / simple structures , 12 have multiple compact groups of emission and 24 have complex morphology . in sources where there is a large discrepancy between the flux recovered in vlbi experiments and that measured with a single dish , we often find the missing flux to be distributed over complex structures .",
    "hence , some relatively simple morphological structures seen in vlbi are likely to be part of a more complex emission structure in at least some sources .",
    "this makes interpretation of the origin of maser emission difficult , and multi - epoch proper motion studies or complementary high resolution mid - infrared or submillimeter observations are required to resolve this problem .",
    "we also find very close correspondence between mid - infrared emission and 6.7  ghz methanol masers as would be expected from theoretical models of the maser emission .",
    "we are extremely grateful to anita richards for invaluable help in merlin data processing and other useful discussions .",
    "we also thank rob beswick and peter thomasson for their assistance in merlin data reduction , anna bartkiewicz for useful discussion , and jim caswell whose comments helped improve the paper .",

    "<S> we present accurate absolute astrometry of 6.7  ghz methanol masers detected in the arecibo methanol maser galactic plane survey using merlin and the expanded very large array ( evla ) . </S>",

    "<S> we also derive the morphologies of the maser emission distributions for sources stronger than @xmath0  jy . the median spatial extent along the major axis of the regions showing maser emission is @xmath1  au . </S>",
    "<S> we find a majority of methanol maser morphologies to be complex with some sources previously determined to have regular morphologies in fact being embedded within larger structures . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that some maser spots do not have a compact core , which leads them being resolved in high angular resolution observations . </S>",
    "<S> this also casts doubt on interpretations of the origin of methanol maser emission solely based on source morphologies . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the association of methanol masers with mid - infrared emission and find very close correspondence between methanol masers and 24  @xmath2 m point sources . </S>",
    "<S> this adds further credence to theoretical models that predict methanol masers to be pumped by warm dust emission and firmly reinforces the finding that class  ii methanol masers are unambiguous tracers of embedded high - mass protostars . </S>"
