    "when an intense electric field is applied to a suspension containing highly polarized particled embedded in a host fluid , the particles will form chains due to the induced dipole moments inside the particles , and hence complex anisotropic structures occur .",
    "also , the apparent viscosity of the suspension will be enhanced greatly .",
    "these structures can have anisotropic physical properties , such as the effective conductivity and permittivity @xcite . in this case ,",
    "optical nonlinearity enhancement was found as well @xcite .",
    "a convenient method of probing the nonlinear characteristics of the field - induced structures is to measure the harmonics of the nonlinear polarization under the application of a sinusoidal ( ac ) electric field @xcite .",
    "therefore it is possible to perform a real - time monitoring of the field - induced aggregation process in such a suspension by measuring the optical nonlinear ac responses both parallel and perpendicular to the uniaxial anisotropic axis .",
    "recently , an anisotropic maxwell - garnett theory @xcite was applied to study the nonlinear polarization of these anisotropic structures @xcite .",
    "anisotropic optical nonlinear ac response was indeed found .    when a nonlinear composite with nonlinear dielectric particles embedded in a host medium , or with a nonlinear host medium is subjected to a sinusoidal field",
    ", the electrical response in the composite will in general be a superposition of many sinusoidal functions @xcite .",
    "it is natural to investigate the effects of a nonlinear characteristics on the optical nonlinear ac response in a colloidal suspension which can be regarded as a nonlinear composite medium @xcite .",
    "the strength of the nonlinear polarization should be reflected in the magnitude of the harmonics . for these field - induced anisotropic structures",
    ", we found that as more and more chains are formed the harmonics of local field and induced dipole moment increase ( decrease ) for longitudinal ( transverse ) field case @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", the effect of nonlinear characteristics on the inter - particle force has been analyzed in a colloidal suspension of nonlinear particles @xcite and further extended to a nonlinear host medium @xcite .",
    "actually , the intrinsic dielectric dispersion often occurs due to the surface conductivity or the inhomogeneous structure ( e.g. , coating effect @xcite ) which often exist in colloidal suspensions .",
    "hence it is of particular importance to discuss the effect of an intrinsic dielectric dispersion on the nonlinear polarization . in this regard , we will use a perturbation expansion method to calculate the nonlinear ac response of a nonlinear composite , i.e. , harmonics of local field as well as induced dipole moment .",
    "let us consider the system in which the suspended particles of radius @xmath0 with a nonlinear dielectric constant are suspended in a host medium of linear dielectric constant @xmath1 .",
    "the nonlinear characteristic gives rise to a field - dependent dielectric coefficient @xcite . in this case ,",
    "the electric displacement - electric field relation inside the spheres is given by : @xmath2with @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the linear coefficient and the weak nonlinear coefficient of the suspended particles , respectively . here",
    "@xmath6 is expressed as a debye expression , @xmath7 is the dielectric constant at high frequency , @xmath8 is the intrinsic dispersion of the particle , @xmath9 is the intrinsic characteristic frequency , with @xmath10 being the intrinsic relaxation time , and @xmath11 is the angular frequency of the external field . in eq.([nl - coefficient ] ) , we have adopted an approximation : the local field inside the particles is assumed to be uniform .",
    "this assumption is called the decoupling approximation @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that such an approximation yields a lower bound for the accurate result for the local field @xcite .",
    "we further assumed that @xmath5 is independent of frequency , which is a valid assumption for low - frequency processes in colloidal suspensions .",
    "as a result , the induced dipole moment under an applied field @xmath12 along @xmath13axis , with @xmath14 being time , is given by @xcite : @xmath15where @xmath16 is the effective dielectric constant of the suspension , and @xmath17 is the field - dependent dipole factor : @xmath18 in order to obtain the effective dielectric constant @xmath16 , we invoke the maxwell - garnett approximation ( mga ) for anisotropic composites @xcite . for the longitudinal field case when the ac field is applied along the uniaxial anisotropic axis , the mga has the form = f .",
    "[ mga ] with @xmath19 being the volume fraction of particles , whereas for an transverse field case when the ac field is applied perpendicular to the uniaxial anisotropic axis , the mga expression is obtained by replacing @xmath20 with @xmath21 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath23 denote the local field factors parallel and perpendicular to the uniaxial anisotropic axis .",
    "these local field factors are defined as the ratio of the local field in the particles to the lorentz cavity field @xcite . for isotropic composites , @xmath24 , while both @xmath20 and @xmath25 will deviate from unity for an anisotropic distribution of particles in composites .",
    "these @xmath26 factors have been evaluated in a tetragonal lattice of dipole moments @xcite and in various field - structured composites @xcite .",
    "we resort to the spectral representation approach @xcite to represent the local field inside the particle @xcite : |*e*_1|^2 = _ 0 ^ 1x , [ ee-1 ] with the material parameter @xmath27 as well as the spectral density function @xmath28 $ ] , which satisfies the sum rule @xmath29 . hence eq.([ee-1 ] ) has the form |*e*_1|^2 = ^2(t ) .",
    "[ average1 ] actually , this is a self - consistent equation for @xmath30 , which can be solved at least numerically @xcite . in",
    "what follows , we will use a perturbation method instead to obtain analytic expressions for harmonics of the local electric field and the induced dipole moment .    on the other hand , due to the uniform local field in each particle , eq.([average1 ] ) can also be directly derived from @xcite :     if we apply a sinusoidal electric field , i.e. @xmath31 , the induced dipole moment @xmath32 will depend on time sinusoidally , too . by virtue of the inversion symmetry",
    ", @xmath32 is a superposition of odd - order harmonics such that = p_t+p_33t+ .",
    "also , the local electric field contains similar harmonics = e_t+e_33t+ .",
    "these harmonic coefficients can be extracted from the time dependence of the solution of @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "in this section , we will apply the perturbation expansion @xcite to extract the harmonics of the local electric field and the induced dipole moment .",
    "it is known that the perturbation expansion method is applicable to weak nonlinearity only , limited by the convergence of the series expansion .",
    "we expand @xmath32 and @xmath34 into a taylor expansion , taking @xmath35 as a perturbative quantity : = _ n=0^ _ _ 1=_1(_1|*e*_1|^2)^n , = _",
    "m=0^ _ _ 1=_1(_1|*e*_1|^2)^m . in view of weak nonlinearity",
    ", we can rewrite eqs.(10 ) and ( 11 ) , keeping the lowest orders of @xmath35 and @xmath36 : @xmath37 where @xmath38,\\nonumber\\\\ j_1&=&\\frac{3|\\ep_2|}{\\rho},\\ \\   j_3=\\frac{27}{2}|\\ep_2|^3\\frac{f\\beta-1}{\\rho|\\rho|}(\\frac{1}{|\\rho|^2}+\\frac{1}{(\\rho^{2})^*}),\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath39 .    in the case of a sinusoidal field",
    ", we can expand @xmath40 in terms of the first and the third harmonics .",
    "the comparison with eq.(8 ) yields the harmonics of the induced dipole moment : p _",
    "e+h_3_1 e^3 ,  p_3 = -h_3 _ 1 e^3 .",
    "[ p3w ] similarly , we find the harmonics of the local electric field _ 1 ^ 1/2e _",
    "= j_1_1 ^ 1/2e+j_3(_1 ^ 1/2e)^3 ,  _ 1 ^ 1/2e_3 = -j_3(_1 ^ 1/2e)^3 .",
    "[ e3w ]    in the above analysis , we have used the identity @xmath41 to obtain the first and the third harmonics .",
    "similar analysis can be used to extract the higher - order harmonics , by retaining more terms in the series expansion .",
    "for instance , to obtain fifth harmonics , we may take into account the identity @xmath42 , and then obtain the harmonics of induced dipole moment and local electric field , respectively : @xmath43 where @xmath44 + \\frac{3\\ep_2 ^ 2}{\\rho(\\ep_1 + 2\\ep_2)^2}\\nonumber\\\\ & & [ \\frac{(1 + 3f - f\\beta)\\rho-(1-f\\beta)(\\rho+3f\\ep_1 - 3f\\ep_2)}{\\rho}- \\frac{2\\rho+6f(\\ep_1-\\ep_2)}{\\ep_1 + 2\\ep_2 } ] \\},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath45 where @xmath46 because of the weak nonlinearity under consideration , the effect of high order harmonics is quite small .",
    "thus , without loss of generality , we only consider the taylor expansion up to second term . in this regard , we will use eqs.([p3w ] ) and ( [ e3w ] ) to investigate the nonlinear ac response in the numerical calculations in next section .",
    "we are now in a position to perform numerical calculations to investigate the dispersion effect on the harmonics of local electric field as well as induced dipole moment .",
    "we let @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the dielectric constant of free space . additionally , set @xmath51 to normalize the induced dipole moment , where @xmath52 is given by the anisotropic mga ( eq.([mga ] ) ) without nonlinear characteristic .",
    "obviously , the expressions for the normalized local electric field and the normalized induced dipole moment are functions of a single variable @xmath53 @xcite . in view of the weak nonlinearity , we set @xmath54 for our calculation .    in fig.1(a)@xmath55(c )",
    ", we investigate the harmonics of local field and induced dipole moment versus frequency for different intrinsic dispersion strengths @xmath8 .",
    "it is obvious that increasing the dispersion strength reduces the harmonics of both the local field and the induced dipole moment .",
    "we find that , for increasing frequency , the harmonics of local field always increases .",
    "however , the harmonics of induced dipole moment exhibits a more complicated behavior . for small @xmath8 ,",
    "the ratio of the third to first harmonics of induced dipole moment decreases as the frequency increases , which is qualitatively in good agreement with the experimental data @xcite . however , for large @xmath8 , its harmonic ratio also increases as the frequency increases .",
    "we expect this behavior can be demonstrated by experiment in the future .    in fig.2 , we investigate the harmonics of local field and induced dipole moment versus frequency for different intrinsic relaxation times @xmath10 . a longitudinal field case ( @xmath56 ) is discussed in fig.2(a ) , while a transverse field case ( @xmath57 ) in fig.2(b ) .",
    "it is shown that , in either case , increasing relaxation time @xmath10 may enhance the harmonics of both local field and induced dipole moment .",
    "in addition , the transverse field case may predict stronger harmonics than the longitudinal field case within high - frequency region , which is actually valid for different dispersion strengths as well ( no figures shown herein ) .    on the other hand , klingenberg claimed that increasing external electric field leads to increasing harmonics of electric current @xcite . in this sense , we have also calculated the effect of external electric field on the nonlinear ac response of the induced dipole moment ( no figures shown herein ) .",
    "obviously , our calculations qualitatively demonstrate the experimental results @xcite as well .",
    "here a few comments on our results are in order . in the present study",
    ", we have examined the case of nonlinear particles suspending in a linear host .",
    "our considerations may be extended to a nonlinear host medium @xcite .",
    "we have studied the effect of an intrinsic dispersion on the nonlinear ac response of a colloidal suspension .",
    "actually , our formalism can be readily generalized to discuss two or more intrinsic dielectric dispersions of particles ( or host fluid ) . in view of the fact that the intrinsic dielectric dispersion often occurs due to the surface conductivity or the inhomogeneous structure ( e.g. , coating effect @xcite )",
    ", we believe such effect also plays an important role in the dielectric behavior of biological cells , such as the electrorotation , dielectrophoresis and electro - orientation .",
    "the perturbation method is used in the present work , but we believe similar results may also be predicted by a self - consistent theory @xcite .    in summary , a perturbation method has been employed to compute the local electric field and the induced dipole moment for suspensions in which the suspended particles have a nonlinear characteristic and an intrinsic dispersion , in an attempt to investigate the frequency effect on the nonlinear ac response .",
    "the results showed , for weak intrinsic dispersion strength , the ratio of the third to first harmonics of the induced dipole moment decreases as the frequency increases , which is qualitatively in agreement with experimental result .",
    "however , for a strong dispersion strength , the harmonics ratio increases as the frequency increases .",
    "moreover , an increase in the intrinsic relaxation time may increase the strength of harmonics .",
