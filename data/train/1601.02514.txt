    "on angular scales @xmath3 arcsec ( corresponding to multipole number @xmath4 ) the power spectrum of the source - subtracted near infrared background ( nirb ) fluctuations has an amplitude that exceeds by @xmath3 times the signal expected from all galaxies below the detection limit and first stars . the origin of such  clustering excess \" ( i.e. due to correlations in the sources spatial distribution )",
    "has now represented a puzzle since its discovery ( @xcite ) .",
    "two scenarios have been proposed to interpret the clustering excess .",
    "the first advocates the contribution from intrahalo light ( ihl ) , i.e. relatively old stars stripped from their parent galaxies following merging events .",
    "these stars therefore reside in between dark matter halos and constitute a low - surface brightness haze around galaxies .",
    "the ihl is expected to come mostly from low redshifts ( @xmath5 ) systems @xcite .",
    "the second scenario is instead based on the presence of a class of early , highly obscured accreting black holes of intermediate mass ( @xmath6 ) at @xmath7 @xcite . as a suitable mechanism to produce such objects",
    "does exist  the so called direct collapse black holes ( dcbh , for a concise overview of the problem see @xcite ) , and the interpretation of the supermassive black holes observed at @xmath8 seemingly requires massive seeds @xcite , such hypothesis seems particularly worth exploring .",
    "both scenarios successfully explain the observed clustering excess , albeit with apparently demanding requirements .",
    "in fact , if the excess is to be explained by intrahalo light , then a large fraction of the stars at low-@xmath2 must reside outside systems that we would normally classify as `` galaxies '' @xcite . on the other hand , in the dcbh scenario the abundance of seed black holes produced until @xmath9 must represent a sizeable fraction of the estimated present - day black hole abundance , as deduced from local scaling relations and recently revised by . however , it is important to outline that both scenarios are not in conflict with any known observational evidence .",
    "the two scenarios , however , differ strongly for what concerns the interpretation of the observed cross - correlation between 3.6 @xmath0 m nirb fluctuations and those measured at ( 0.5 - 2 ) kev in the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) by @xcite .",
    "while accreting black holes naturally produce x - ray emission , no obvious similar mechanism can be identified for intrahalo stars , thus making difficult to explain the observed cross - correlation .",
    "the dcbh scenario might have its own problems .",
    "they could possibly arise from the recent measurement of nirb fluctuations at 1.1 and 1.6 @xmath0 m obtained by ciber .",
    "@xcite showed that these fluctuations do correlate with those observed at 3.6 @xmath0 m by spitzer , thus suggesting a common source .",
    "if confirmed , this could possibly represent a problem for dcbhs as their formation must stop , based on a number of physical arguments discussed in @xcite , after @xmath10 .",
    "intergalactic absorption at wavelengths shorter than the ly@xmath11 line would then prevent dcbh to contribute at 1.1 and 1.6 @xmath0 m .    here",
    ", we show that the cross - correlation between ciber and spitzer bands does not represent a problem for the dcbh hypothesis , as very likely it arises from a well - known contaminant : diffuse galactic light ( dgl ) , i.e. dust scattered or thermally emitted light in the milky waym ) thermal emission from grains is referred to as the  galactic cirrus \" . ] .",
    "@xcite pointed out that dgl strongly contributes to the ciber 1.1 and 1.6 @xmath0 m auto - correlation power spectra on large scales .",
    "motivated by this evidence , we show that the 1.1@xmath123.6 @xmath0 m and 1.6@xmath123.6 @xmath0 m cross - correlations at the largest scales ( @xmath13 ) can be purely ascribed to the dgl and that there is no tension between the high redshift dcbh scenario and ciber observations .",
    "actually , the sub - dominant contribution of dgl in the 3.6@xmath0 m band helps _ decreasing _ the dcbh abundance required to explain the clustering excess .",
    "in order to estimate the dgl component in the 3.6 @xmath0 m auto - correlation power spectrum we proceed in the following way .",
    "first , we use the fact that on small scales ( and in all bands ) shot noise completely dominates the 1-halo and 2-halo clustering terms both in the auto- and cross - correlation power spectra . therefore we can safely assume that at these scales @xmath14 and derive the value of @xmath15 by fitting the five ciber data points at the smallest scales in the 1.1 @xmath0 m and 1.6 @xmath0 m auto - correlation power spectra , and in the 1.1(1.6)@xmath123.6 @xmath0 m cross - correlation ones .",
    "results of the fit are reported in table  [ fittings ] .",
    "similarly , on the largest scales the signal is dominated by the dgl component , so that @xmath16 here we assume , following @xcite , that the dgl power spectrum has a power - law form with a fixed slope @xmath17 for both the dgl auto - correlation and cross - correlation power spectra as derived by the combined fit of ciber and hst data @xcite .",
    "results of the fit of the six ciber data points on the largest scales are also given in table  [ fittings ] .",
    "we checked that our results do not change significantly when we let the value of @xmath11 vary within its 1@xmath18 errors ( @xmath19 ) .",
    ".best fitting parameters for 1.1 and 1.6 @xmath0 m auto- , and 1.1@xmath123.6 , 1.6@xmath123.6 @xmath0 m cross - correlation power spectra .",
    "we use the 5 ( 6 ) data points at the smallest ( largest ) angular scales for shot noise ( dgl ) component fitting . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + [ fittings ]    we further implicitly assume here that the dgl fluctuations at two wavelengths are perfectly correlated ( i.e. unity correlation coefficient )",
    ". this seems a reasonable assumption given that the three bands very closely spaced in wavelength . at this point",
    "we can derive the contribution of dgl to the 3.6 @xmath0 m auto - correlation power spectrum as @xmath20 which gives @xmath21 in the previous expressions , @xmath22 corresponds to the 3.6 @xmath0 m band ; @xmath23 corresponds either to the 1.1 or 1.6 @xmath0 m band .",
    "note that the dgl is derived from the ( 1.1)1.6@xmath123.6 @xmath0 m cross - correlation power spectra in @xcite . in this work spitzer observations were analyzed using a shallower source subtraction depth ( mag @xmath24 ) than in the original work by @xcite , who instead used a deeper threshold ( mag @xmath25 ) . as a result",
    ", the 3.6 @xmath0 m auto - power spectrum in @xcite is largely dominated by shot noise and no interesting signal is seen .",
    "for this reason we have decided to compare the derived auto - power spectrum with the 3.6 @xmath0 m auto - power in @xcite .",
    "this should not introduce any artifacts , as the dgl component must be independent of the point source subtraction depth .",
    "also , note that the dgl fitting has been derived for the same fields , thus eliminating possible effects introduced by the dependence of the dgl signal from galactic coordinates .",
    "we compare the curve @xmath26l^2/(2\\pi)$ ] and its 1@xmath18 variance with observations in fig .",
    "[ auto ] . we find that both the ciber measured auto - correlation power spectra and the cross - correlation power spectra could be nicely matched by the sum of shot noise and dgl without the need for additional components . indeed , while some extra - power can be seen in ciber data at @xmath27 , such an bump is not seen in @xcite where resolved sources are subtracted down to a much deeper limiting magnitude .",
    "thus it is likely that this bump in ciber data can be due to foreground sources not resolved in @xcite analysis .",
    "as described in the previous section , we estimate the contribution of the dgl to the 3.6 @xmath0 m auto - correlation power spectrum from both 1.1 @xmath0 m and 1.6 @xmath0 m data .",
    "we obtain a value for the dgl amplitude log(@xmath28 and log(@xmath29 from the 1.1 @xmath0 m and 1.6 @xmath0 m data , respectively . in the top panels of fig .",
    "[ auto36 ] we show the 3.6 @xmath0 m fluctuation spectrum measured by spitzer ( @xcite for the same field , and @xcite in a different field as comparison ) , along with the contribution from dgl and @xmath30 galaxies ( clustering and shot noise ) as computed by following the methods in @xcite .",
    "the solid line shows the sum of these two components while the light shaded area indicates the 1@xmath18 uncertainty .    shot noise and dgl account quite well for the observed power on both large and small scales .",
    "however , the clustering excess is still clearly visible at intermediate scales , i.e. at @xmath31 . in principle",
    ", such extra power might be partially accounted by the large errors associated to the estimated dgl component .",
    "however , the maximally allowed dgl power spectrum largely overestimates the observed signal at @xmath32 . moreover , we recall that if the 3.6 @xmath0 m fluctuations were purely due to the combination of low-@xmath2 galaxies and dgl signals , the observed 3.6 @xmath0 m - cxb cross - correlation would remain unexplained .",
    "given the results on the dgl obtained so far , it is important to re - examine the dcbh scenario in @xcite to assess whether dcbhs can simultaneously provide the extra power at intermediate scales _ and _ the observed 3.6 @xmath0m - cxb cross - correlation .",
    "dcbh forms out of pristine gas within atomic - cooling halos ( @xmath33  k ) that are irradiated by a strong external flux in the lyman - werner or near - infrared bands ( @xmath34 erg s@xmath35@xmath36hz@xmath35sr@xmath35 , see e.g. @xcite ) . in such halos",
    "the ly@xmath11 transition is the only efficient cooling mechanism , since h@xmath37 formation is suppressed . as a result",
    "the gas contracts almost isothermally and eventually directly collapses into a central black hole seed of mass @xmath38 .",
    "the seed continues to accrete the surrounding gas , and radiates energy from radio to x - ray with a spectrum derived by , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "we will consider two cases : ( i ) the fiducial model described in @xcite , with a mass density in active dcbhs @xmath39mpc@xmath40 at peak , and ( ii ) a reduced model in which the abundance is about 2/3 of the fiducial one , @xmath41mpc@xmath40 .",
    "note that the dcbh mass density @xmath42 , so there are degeneracies between the @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "here , we actually only vary the @xmath43 , while keeping other parameters as in the fiducial model . results are shown in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ auto36 ] .",
    "it is clear that the dcbh fiducial model can provide the required power at intermediate scales to and , when added to the dgl and low-@xmath2 galaxy contributions ( solid line ) , it gives a good fit to spitzer data at all scales .",
    "moreover , given the uncertainties in the dgl signal determination , even the reduced dcbh model can be accommodated .",
    "we then turn to the cxb .",
    "[ irx ] reports the cross - correlation spectrum between cxb in @xmath45 kev @xcite and 3.6 @xmath0 m ir fluctuations .",
    "we also plot the expected dcbh contribution for the fiducial ( reduced ) model assuming a typical x - ray equivalent hi column density of @xmath46  @xmath36 , and the sum of the dcbh + low-@xmath2 sources ( agns , galaxies and hot gas , modeled by @xcite ) .",
    "clearly , dcbhs can provide the extra power at large scales required by the data ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "we also find that the predicted cxb auto - correlation power spectrum of dcbhs for both the fiducial and reduced model is still well below the measured level @xcite , and does not exceed the unresolved fraction of the cxb intensity at 1.5 kev measured by .",
    "the dcbh scenario accounting for the observed `` clustering excess '' over known galaxies signal in the nirb power spectrum has been questioned by the recent detection of a correlation between the two ciber 1.1/1.6 @xmath0 m bands with the 3.6 @xmath0 m spitzer one .",
    "this correlation is hardly explained by early dcbhs that , due to intergalactic absorption , can not contribute to the shortest wavelength bands .",
    "we have shown that the new correlation is caused instead by a diffuse galactic light ( dgl ) component arising from galactic stellar light scattered by dust . in particular , we have found that :    * the ( 1.1)1.6@xmath123.6 @xmath0 m cross - correlation power spectra can be fitted nicely by a dgl component that dominates the large scale nirb fluctuations , and a shot noise component from the remaining low-@xmath2 galaxies accounting for the small scale power . * by assuming perfect correlations ( unity correlation coefficient ) at different wavelengths , the derived best - fitting dgl fluctuations dominate the 3.6 @xmath0 m auto - correlation power spectra on scales @xmath47 . between @xmath48 extra sources in addition to the dgl and",
    "the remaining low-@xmath2 galaxies are required to interpret the  clustering excess \" . *",
    "if the 3.6 @xmath0 m nirb fluctuations are only from dgl + remaining low-@xmath2 galaxies , the observed 3.6-cxb cross - correlation is hard to explain . introducing the dcbh gives a much better fit of 3.6 @xmath0 m auto - correlation power spectra , and naturally explains the 3.6-cxb cross - correlation .",
    "it also predicts the much decreased clustering term in nirb - cxb correlations at @xmath49  @xmath0 m . *",
    "finally , we point out that the dgl inclusion allows to decrease by up to about 30% the required dcbh abundance / mass .",
    "we conclude that the dcbh scenario remains a viable interpretation of the puzzling nirb clustering excess , making the nirb a superb tool to investigate the pristine cosmic epochs in which the supermassive black hole seeds formed .",
    "we thank the euclid - librae team for insightful discussions .",
    "we are also indebted to m. zemcov and a. cooray for help with the interpretation of the ciber data , to a. cooray and k. mitchell - wynne for useful comments ."
