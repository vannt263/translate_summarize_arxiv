    "# 1#2#3_#3 # 1#2#3_#3 # 1 # 1    recently , a bethe ansatz study @xcite of the dilute a@xmath0 lattice model @xcite has revealed a hidden e@xmath1 structure .",

    "e@xmath1 @xmath7-matrix of the critical ising model in a field @xcite . one of the drawbacks , however , of this bethe ansatz approach is that it relies heavily on the acceptance of a conjectured string structure of the bethe ansatz equations . in this letter",
    "we demonstrate the e@xmath1 structure of the dilute a@xmath0 model directly , without the use of a string hypothesis .    in recent papers",
    "melzer  @xcite and berkovich @xcite have shown that the 1-dimensional configuration sums of the abf model admit a so - called fermionic representation in addition to the well - known bosonic forms of andrews _",
    "et al . _",
    "their motivation was in fact to prove rogers  ramanujan ( rr ) type identities for the @xmath8 virasoro characters associated with the minimal unitary models of central charge @xmath9 as conjectured by the stony brook group  @xcite . in this letter",
    "we adopt a similar approach . specifically , we rewrite the known bosonic expressions for the 1-dimensional configuration sums of the dilute a@xmath0 model in regime 2@xmath10 @xcite in terms of fermionic sums . these fermionic sums explicitly involve the e@xmath1 root system . in particular , in the thermodynamic limit ,",

    "thermodynamic bethe ansatz computations were also carried out  @xcite in regime 3@xmath10 of the dilute a@xmath0 model . in this case",
    "the model is known  @xcite to decouple in the scaling limit into an ising model and a @xmath12 perturbed minimal model .",
    "accordingly , the bethe ansatz computations  @xcite on the dilute a@xmath0 model in regime 3@xmath10 gives an a@xmath3 structure leading to the correct central charge @xmath13 .",
    "these findings for regime 3@xmath14 are supported in this letter . by considering the thermodynamic limit of our `` fermionic sum = bosonic sum '' expressions , after carrying out the transformation @xmath15 , which maps regime 2@xmath10 onto regime 3@xmath10 @xcite",
    ", we find an a@xmath3 rogers  ramanujan identity similar to the e@xmath6 identity for the @xmath16 character conjectured by kedem _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .    to conclude this letter",
    ", we point out some intriguing expressions for the number of walks on the adjacency graph of the dilute a@xmath0 model in terms of the e@xmath1 cartan matrix .    before we present the main results of this letter we need to introduce some notation .",
    "we define the gaussian multinomials or @xmath17-multinomials by @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 for @xmath20 and @xmath21 . also , if @xmath22 denotes the incidence matrix of e@xmath1 with the nodes labelled as in figure  1a , we define the following thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) type systems : @xmath23 here @xmath24 and @xmath25 are 8-dimensional column vectors with _ integer _",
    "entries @xmath26 , @xmath27 , respectively , and @xmath28 is a unit vector with components @xmath29 .",
    "the parameter @xmath5 will be referred to as the system size .",
    "a pair of vectors @xmath30 and @xmath31 solving the @xmath32-th tba type equation with system size @xmath5 will be denoted by @xmath33 .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we now define the fermionic functions @xmath34 by @xmath35 with @xmath36 the cartan matrix of e@xmath1 which is related to the incidence matrix by @xmath37 .",
    "finally , we define the bosonic functions @xmath38 by @xcite @xmath39 with these definitions our main assertion can be written as @xmath40 explicitly , this polynomial identity takes the form @xmath41 which can be viewed as a finitization of the e@xmath1 rogers  ramanujan identity of kedem _ et al . _",
    "indeed , taking the limit @xmath42 , using the result @xcite @xmath43 together with the simple formula @xmath44 , gives @xmath45 the rhs of this e@xmath1 rogers  ramanujan identity is the usual ( bosonic ) rocha - caridi form for the @xmath11 virasoro character  @xcite .",
    "the lhs is the fermionic counterpart conjectured by kedem _",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "before we proceed to sketch a proof of identity ( [ e8id ] ) , let us first explain how the above results relate to the e@xmath1 structure of the dilute a@xmath0 model . to this end",
    "we note that the bosonic side of equation ( [ e8id ] ) is precisely the expression for the 1-dimensional configuration sum @xmath46 of the dilute a@xmath0 model in regime 2@xmath10 as computed in @xcite .",
    "more generally , the configuration sums @xmath47 with @xmath48 and @xmath49 are defined via @xmath50 the function @xmath51 herein follows directly from the boltzmann weights of the dilute a@xmath0 model by computing the ordered infinite field limit @xmath52 , @xmath53 fixed ) @xmath54 here @xmath55 is the spectral parameter , @xmath56 is the crossing parameter and @xmath57 is the nome of the elliptic function parametrization of the face weights  @xcite .",
    "a complete listing of the values of @xmath58 is given in ( a.5 ) of ref .",
    "the occurrence of the particular configuration sum @xmath46 in ( [ e8id ] ) can be understood from the fact that the configuration with all spins on the lattice taking the value 1 corresponds to the ground state of the model .",
    "the proof of identity ( [ e8id ] ) is long and tedious so we will present it in full elsewhere . here",
    "we only indicate the main ingredients of the proof and omit the detailed calculations .",
    "let us recall that the configuration sums @xmath47 satisfy the recurrences @xcite @xmath59 subject to the initial condition @xmath60 moreover , the recurrence relations together with the initial conditions uniquely determine the configuration sums @xmath47 . in view of ( [ e8id ] )",
    "we will only consider the case @xmath61 .",
    "apart from @xmath46 we now also express the other @xmath62 firstly in terms of fermionic sums and secondly in terms of bosonic sums .",
    "if we can then show that both the fermionic and bosonic expressions satisfy the recurrences ( [ recur ] ) together with ( [ init ] ) , the fermionic sums must equal the bosonic ones due to the uniqueness of solution to ( [ recur ] ) and ( [ init ] ) .",
    "first , we list the bosonic expressions for @xmath62 : @xmath63 the proof that this solves ( [ recur ] ) and ( [ init ] ) has been given in @xcite .",
    "second , we list fermionic expressions for @xmath62 :    y^111_l(q ) & = & f_1(l ) + y^112_l(q ) & = & q^l f_1(l ) + y^121_l(q ) & = & ( f_7(l)-(1-q^l)f_1(l ) -q^l(1-q^l)f_1(l-1 ) . + & &",
    ". + q^2l-1(1-q^l-1)f_1(l-2 ) ) /q^l+1 + y^122_l(q ) & = & ( f_7(l)-(1-q^l)f_1(l ) + q^2l-1(1-q^l-1)f_1(l-2 ) ) /q + y^123_l(q ) & = & q^2l-1 ( f_7(l ) + q^l-1(1-q^l-1 ) f_1(l-2 ) ) [ ferm1pf ] + y^132_l(q ) & = & ( f_7(l)-f_1(l)+q^l f_7(l-1 ) + q^l-1(1-q^l-1)f_7(l-2 ) .",
    "+ q^2l-2(1-q^l-2)f_1(l-3 ) + q^2l-4(1-q^l-1)(1-q^l-3)f_1(l-4 ) ) /q^l+3 + y^133_l(q ) & = & q^l-3 ( f_7(l)-f_1(l)+f_7(l-1 ) + q^l-1(1-q^l-1)f_7(l-2 ) .",
    "+ q^l-2(1-q^l-2)f_1(l-3 ) + q^2l-4(1-q^l-1)(1-q^l-3)f_1(l-4 ) ) .",
    "these expressions are admittedly quite complicated and might very well be simplified .",
    "for example , we have chosen to express all configuration sums in terms of @xmath64 and @xmath65 only .",
    "using easily verifiable recurrences of the type @xmath66 , @xmath67 , etc . , one could conceivably find simpler forms for the above .    to prove the correctness of the fermionic solution to the recurrence relations we substitute ( [ ferm1pf ] ) into ( [ recur ] ) .",
    "this gives seven identities which can be combined to yield the following two equations     +   + & & + q^l-1f_1(l-2 ) -q^l ( 1-q^l-2)f_1(l-3 ) + q^l ( 1-q^l-2)(1-q^l-3)f_7(l-3 ) = 0 .",
    "the actual proof of these final two equations will be omitted here , but we remark that they follow from elementary but tedious computations very similar to those carried out in @xcite .",
    "the proof that ( [ ferm1pf ] ) satisfies the initial conditions is a matter of straightforward case checking .    in this section",
    "we consider the @xmath42 limit of identity ( [ e8id ] ) after first replacing @xmath17 by @xmath68 .",
    "the effect of this transformation on @xmath17 is to map from regime 2@xmath14 to regime 3@xmath14 of the dilute a@xmath0 model .",
    "the critical behaviour of the model in this latter regime is described by @xcite a @xmath69 conformal field theory given as a direct product of an ising model ( @xmath70 ) and an e@xmath6 theory with @xmath71 .",
    "hence it is to be expected that the above steps will result in an a@xmath3 rogers  ramanujan identity .    to establish this we use two simple inversion formulas : @xmath72 applying ( [ inv3 ] ) to transform the bosonic rhs of ( [ e8id ] ) we obtain , after performing a shift on the summation variable @xmath73 ,",
    "@xmath74 here the variable @xmath75 is given by the parity of @xmath5 via @xmath76 .",
    "multiplying by the factor @xmath77 and taking the thermodynamic limit using the result @xmath78 yields @xmath79 this final expression indeed has the expected factorized form as alluded to before , with the second term being the @xmath16 character corresponding to a @xmath80 conformal field theory .",
    "we now turn to the fermionic lhs of ( [ e8id ] ) . after replacing @xmath17 with @xmath68 , applying ( [ inv2 ] ) and multiplying by the factor @xmath77",
    ", the fermionic sum takes the form @xmath81 where the sum is an unrestricted sum over the components of @xmath24 and we regard the components @xmath27 as given in terms of @xmath26 by the tba system ( [ tba ] ) .",
    "we split the sum into two parts with the restrictions @xmath82 where @xmath75 gives the parity of @xmath5 . after making the shifts @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively , where @xmath85 the fermionic sum can be written as    & & _",
    "n_2+n_4+n_8= q^(2n_1)^2/2+^t c__7 ^ -1 _ i=2 ^ 8 + & + & _",
    "n_2+n_4+n_8=1- q^(2n_1 + 1)^2/2+^t c__7 ^ -1 _",
    "i=2 ^ 8 .",
    "here @xmath86 , @xmath87 satisfy the tba system @xmath88 where @xmath89 is even or odd , respectively .",
    "combining the two sums into one sum and replacing @xmath90 with @xmath91 now gives @xmath92 taking the limit @xmath42 and equating this to the bosonic rhs gives the identity @xmath93 this identity clearly has an a@xmath3 structure and is very similar to the e@xmath6 identity of kedem _ et al . _",
    "@xcite . indeed , these results suggest that the @xmath70 character should explicitly factor out of the lhs of this identity , but we have been unable to do this .    in this last section",
    "we list some fermionic expressions for the number of @xmath5-step paths on the dilute a@xmath0 adjacency graph @xmath94 , shown in figure  1c .",
    "these results come about by realizing that in the critical @xmath4 limit , the function @xmath38 counts the number of paths from @xmath95 to @xmath96 of length @xmath5 on @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "in other words , in this limit , the function @xmath97 , with @xmath98 the incidence matrix corresponding to @xmath94 .",
    "( we remind the reader that @xmath99_q = \\left({\\textstyle{n \\atop m_1,m_2,\\ldots , m_n } } \\right)$ ] , the rhs being an ordinary multinomial . )    setting @xmath4 in some of our `` fermionic sum = bosonic sum '' identities ( not all of which are listed in this paper ) we find @xmath100 as @xmath98 has only four distinct entries these results are complete .",
    "in this letter we have shown directly that the dilute a@xmath0 model in regime 2@xmath14 exhibits a hidden e@xmath1 structure .",
    "this was achieved by rewriting the known bosonic expressions for the 1-dimensional configuration sums in terms of fermionic sums involving the e@xmath1 root system .",
    "our results confirm recent work of ref .",
    "@xcite where an e@xmath1 structure was found using the bethe ansatz approach together with an appropriate string hypothesis . as a byproduct of our work ,",
    "we prove e@xmath1  @xcite and a@xmath3 type rogers - ramanujan identities .    to conclude , we point out that a similar program can be carried out for the dilute a@xmath101 and a@xmath102 models  @xcite . in doing",
    "so we find that these models in regime 2 exhibit e@xmath6 and e@xmath102 structures , respectively .",
    "this again confirms the earlier findings of ref .",
    "@xcite that these two models correspond to the exceptional @xmath7-matrices of zamolodchikov and fateev  @xcite .",
