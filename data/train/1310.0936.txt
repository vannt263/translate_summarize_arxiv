    "fenn , rolfsen and zhu @xcite determined the centralizer of the standard parabolic subgroup @xmath0 in the braid group @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) @xcite .",
    "this result was generalized by paris @xcite who computed generating sets for the centralizer of parabolic subgroups having connected associated coxeter graphs for artin groups of type @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .    in this paper , we characterize the _",

    "furthermore , we apply this result to the subgroup conjugacy problem for parabolic subgroups of @xmath1 .",
    "the conjugacy problem in the braid group @xmath1 was solved in the seminal paper of garside @xcite .",
    "a more general problem is the _ subgroup conjugacy problem for @xmath9 _ : given two elements @xmath10 , and a subgroup @xmath9 , decide whether @xmath11 and @xmath12 are conjugated by an element in @xmath6 . in general , this problem is presumably undecidable , because @xmath13 can be embedded in @xmath1 for @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 is the free group on two generators ) , and for @xmath13 , according to a result of mihailova @xcite , even the subgroup membership ( or generalized word ) problem is unsolvable .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting to consider the subgroup conjugacy problem for particular natural subgroups of @xmath1 . indeed ,",
    "even the subgroup conjugacy problem for the natural embedded subgroups @xmath16 , for @xmath17 , has been open for @xmath18 until @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath19 was resolved in @xcite , which was of particular interest , since the so - called _ shifted conjugacy problem _ @xcite , which was also unknown to be solvable @xcite , is equivalent to some subgroup conjugacy problem for @xmath20 in @xmath1 @xcite . in @xcite , the subgroup conjugacy problem for @xmath21",
    "was transformed to an equivalent bi - simultaneous conjugacy problem .",
    "then , in @xcite , the subgroup conjugacy problem for all parabolic subgroups of braid groups , even for all so - called garside subgroups @xcite of garside groups , was solved completely , and deterministic algorithms were provided .",
    "the solution in @xcite does not resort to a detour via a simultaneous conjugacy problem , but there we can not apply any cycling and decycling operations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the invariant subsets of the conjugacy class are quite large .    in this paper , we provide a second solution of the subgroup conjugacy problem for all parabolic subgroups of @xmath1 .",
    "this solution is a generalization of the approach developed in @xcite , namely we reduce the problem to an instance of a simultaneous conjugacy problem .",
    "also the invariant subsets of the simultaneous conjugacy class involved in lee and lee s solution @xcite are relatively big . in @xcite , we introduce new much smaller invariant subsets of the simultaneous conjugacy class , namely the so - called _ lexicographic super summit sets_. using these new improved invariant subsets , our new approach to the subgroup conjugacy problem for parabolic subgroups of @xmath1 , given in corollary [ subcphred ] , is expected to be more efficient than the direct solution ( using fractional normal forms ) from @xcite .",
    "though the subgroup conjugacy problem for standard parabolic subgroups of the braid groups deserves interest on its own , a particular motivation comes from applications in cryptography .",
    "indeed , dehornoy @xcite proposed an authentication scheme based on the shifted conjugacy problem .",
    "we remark that , by using generalized shifted conjugacy operations , it is straightforward to construct shifted conjugacy problems which can be reduced to some subgroup conjugacy problem for @xmath16 . furthermore , the diffie - hellman public key exchange based on the braid group , introduced by ko et al .",
    "@xcite , relies on the subgroup conjugacy problem for @xmath16 .",

    "we provide two proofs for our main result on double centralizers . the first proof , given in section [ elementary approach ] , is elementary and the result",
    "is shown only for parabolic subgroups with connected associated coxeter graph ( as in @xcite ) . despite its limitation",
    "we expose this elementary proof here in detail , because one may succeed in future to `` algebraize '' its techniques completely . then it may also apply to other artin groups , e.g. of type b or d. + more precisely , section [ elementary approach ] contains the following subsections .",
    "section [ prem ] deals with generating sets of the centralizer of @xmath23 in @xmath1 .",
    "we simplify gurzo s generating sets in order to determine the algebraic structure of these centralizers .",
    "for the convenience of the reader , we include in section [ nmin2 ] a solution to the subgroup conjugacy problem for @xmath24 in @xmath1 , where we introduce the basic ideas which will be used in greater generality in the subsequent two subsections",
    ". then , section [ ccparah ] describes the main result concerning double centralizers for parabolic subgroups ( with connected associated coxeter graph ) .",
