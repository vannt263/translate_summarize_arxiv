    "channeling of the charged projectiles in crystals establishes a field of research important both with respect to the fundamental theoretical studies as well as to the ongoing experiments ( see , e.g. , the monograph  @xcite and the references therein ) . starting from the first theoretical predictions by lindhard  @xcite",
    ", the channeling is known to occur when the projectiles move in the crystals preferably along the crystalline planes or axes .",
    "this phenomenon opens a possibility to manipulate the beams of projectiles , in particular by deflecting them in bent crystals .",
    "of particular interest for the theory and applications is the radiation produced by the channeling projectiles .",
    "the radiation spectra display distinct lines related to the inter - planar oscillations or axial rotations of the particles involved into the planar or axial channeling , respectively , in contrast to the bremsstrahlung - type spectra produced by the non - channeling projectiles . in periodically bent crystals , the channeling radiation exhibit additional _ undulator lines _ as a result of modulation of the transverse velocity of the moving particles by the bent crystalline structure .",
    "the positions of the undulator lines depend on the bending period and the projectile energies and thereby can be tuned in an experiment .",
    "theoretically , a crystalline undulator has been suggested  @xcite as a source of the monochromatic radiation of sub - mev to mev energies , and different experiments have been being performed to produce and detect the undulator radiation .",
    "the original concept of the crystalline undulator assumes the projectiles to move through the crystal following the periodically bent crystalline planes or axes . for such motions ,",
    "the undulator modulation frequencies are smaller than the frequencies of the channeling oscillations or rotations providing the undulator spectral lines to arise at the energies below the energies of the channeling lines .",
    "recently , channeling has been studied for periodically bent crystals with the bending period shorter than the period of channeling oscillations in the straight crystal  @xcite .",
    "the emergent radiation was shown to display spectral lines at the energies exceeding the energies of the channeling peaks .",
    "the corresponding theoretical simulations have been performed for the electron and positron channeling in the silicon crystals with the ( 110)-planes bent according to the shapes @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a coordinate along the planes in the straight crystal , whereas @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the bending amplitude and period , respectively .",
    "the simulations have also assumed the amplitude @xmath2 to be substantially smaller than the inter - planner distance @xmath4 in the straight crystal .",
    "in contrast to the channeling in conventional crystalline undulator , for the newly proposed crystalline structures the channeling projectiles do not follow the short - period bent planes .",
    "the positrons move bouncing between the bent planes , whereas the electrons move preferable through the small - amplitude `` waves '' of the bent structures . yet",
    "the motion of the projectiles acquires a short - period modulation resulting from the bending and explicitly seen in the theoretically simulated trajectories  @xcite .",
    "these modulations are of a regular jitter - type and responsible for producing the high - energy monochromatic radiation .",
    "interestingly , a similar radiative mechanism has recently been studied with respect to the radiation produced by relativistic particles in interstellar environments with turbulent small - scale fluctuations of the magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "it requires , in our view , some future clarifications on whether the jitter - type channeling motions in crystals provide observable properties ( in particular for the radiation detected ) inherent to the conventional undulator . within the current studies ,",
    "we adopt the term _ small - amplitude short - period _ ( sasp ) to designate the bent crystalline structures suggested in ref .",
    "important is that , the sasp bent crystals can be regarded as possible efficient sources of tunable monochromatic hard - energy radiation and therefore are of immediate interest for applications and further theoretical studies .",
    "since introducing the sasp bent crystals  @xcite , several theoretical and experimental studies have already been performed on the new regime of channeling and the radiation produced  @xcite .",
    "however , further efforts are certainly required for more detailed investigations on statistical properties of channeling as well as on computing the radiation spectra for a variety of conditions including different bending parameters , lengths of the crystalline samples , beam energies and angular apertures for detecting the radiation .",
    "the focus of the present paper is on the theoretical simulations for the electrons and positrons with the energies of @xmath5  mev that are the beam energies achievable in experiments at mainz microtron facility  @xcite .    as in a number of our recent studies ,",
    "three - dimensional simulations of the propagation of ultra - relativistic projectiles through the crystal are performed by using the mbn explorer package  @xcite .",
    "this package was originally developed as a universal numerical tool to study structure and dynamics on the spatial scales from nanometers and above for a wide range of complex atomic and molecular systems . in order to address the channeling phenomena ,",
    "an additional module has been incorporated into the mbn explorer to compute the motion for relativistic projectiles along with dynamical simulations of the propagation environments , including the crystalline structures , in the course of projectile s motion  @xcite .",
    "these computations advance to account for the interaction of the projectiles with the separate atoms of the environments , whereas a variety of interatomic potentials implemented in  mbn explorer support rigorous simulations of various media .",
    "the developed software package can be regarded as a powerful numerical tool to uncover the dynamics of relativistic projectiles in crystals , amorphous bodies , as well as in biological environments .",
    "its efficiency and reliability has already been benchmarked for the channeling in crystals  @xcite .",
    "the calculated with the mbn explorer relativistic motion , represented by the projectile s coordinates and velocities at the instances of the propagation time , is used as the input data to compute the spectral and/or the spectral - angular distributions of the emitted radiation .",
    "a module for calculating the radiation emergent from the channeling is included into the latest version of mbn explorer  @xcite .",
    "we consider the motion of the projectiles through the crystal as being governed by the laws of classical relativistic dynamics : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the coordinate , @xmath8 is the velocity and @xmath9 is the momentum of the particle at the propagation time @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the relativistic lorentz - factor , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the energy and the rest mass of the particle , respectively , and @xmath14 is the speed of light .",
    "the driving force , sensitive to the charge @xmath15 of the projectile , stems from an electrostatic potential @xmath16 for the particle - crystal interaction .",
    "mbn explorer allows for computing the latter potential from the interactions of the projectile with the individual atoms , @xmath17 the spacial locations @xmath18 of the atoms are selected according to the crystalline structures of the interest ( including the effect of thermal fluctuations ) .",
    "the atomic potentials @xmath19 in our simulations are evaluated within the moliere approximation @xcite . a rapid decrease of these potentials with increasing the distances from the atoms allows to truncate the sum ( [ mc_simulations.02 ] ) in practical calculations .",
    "mbn explorer provides an option to restrict the atoms contributing to the interaction @xmath20 to these located inside a cut - off sphere around the coordinate @xmath21 , as well as invokes an efficient linked - cell algorithm to search for the atoms inside this sphere .    a particular feature of mbn explorer is simulating the environment `` on the fly '' i.e. in the course of computing the motion of the projectiles . for channeling , the crystalline lattice is simulated inside a box surrounding the position of the projectile and the simulation box shifts accordingly to the motion of the projectile .",
    "the coordinate frame for the simulations has the @xmath1-axis along the incoming beam and parallel to the crystalline planes responsible for the channeling , whereas the @xmath22 axis is set perpendicular to these planes . in order to exclude an accidental axial channeling",
    ", the @xmath1-axis should avoid major crystallographic directions . for channeling along the ( 110 ) planes",
    ", we opted to define the @xmath1-axis by a direction @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "the simulation box is filled by the crystalline lattice with the nodes @xmath25 , selected with account for the thermal displacements @xmath26 of the atomic nuclei with respect to the equilibrium positions @xmath27 .",
    "the equilibrium nodes correspond to the bravais cells for the crystal , whereas the cartesian components @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) of the thermal displacements are selected randomly according to the normal distribution @xmath30 the values of the amplitude @xmath31 of the thermal vibrations are well - known for various crystals and can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the silicon crystals at room temperature we use the value @xmath32  .    the equations ( [ mc_simulations.01 ] ) are numerically integrated forth from @xmath33 when the particle enters the crystal at @xmath34 .",
    "the initial values @xmath35 and @xmath36 for the transverse coordinates are selected randomly from an entrance domain where the beam can be guided by the crystalline planes to get into the inside of the crystal .",
    "the size of this domain is taken between @xmath37 and @xmath38 in the @xmath39-direction and between @xmath4 and @xmath40 in the @xmath22-direction , where @xmath4 is the inter - planner separation for the crystal .",
    "the initial velocity @xmath41 has the value determined by the beam energy and is predominantly oriented in the @xmath1-direction , i.e. the values @xmath42 and @xmath43 are small compared to the value @xmath44 . the non - vanishing @xmath42 and @xmath43 can be adjusted to account for the beam emittance .",
    "the data presented below in sects .",
    "[ lengths ] and [ spectra ] are obtained for the zero emittance , @xmath45 .    when computing the motion of the projectile through the crystal with mbn explorer , an efficient algorithm of `` dynamic simulation box '' @xcite is used as follows . inside a simulation box ,",
    "the particle interacts with the atoms of the cutoff sphere . as the particle moves",
    ", the sphere shifts and at some point meets an edge of the box .",
    "once this happens , a new simulation box is introduced being centered at the current position of the projectile .",
    "the new box is then filled with the crystalline lattice such that the nodes inside the intersection of the old and the new simulation boxes remain unchanged i.e. not being simulated anew with including the effect of the thermal vibrations .",
    "this allows to avoid a spurious change in the driving force as well as reduces numerical efforts in simulating the crystalline environment in the course of the projectile s motion .",
    "the above described numerical propagation procedure terminates when the @xmath1-coordinate of the projectile approaches the thickness @xmath46 of the crystal under study . to simulate a periodically bent crystal , the @xmath22-coordinates for each lattice node @xmath47",
    "are obtained from these for the straight crystal by the transformation @xmath48 with @xmath49 being determined by the bending profile  ( [ pb_profile : eq ] ) .    employing the monte - carlo technique for sampling the incoming projectiles as well as for accounting for the thermal fluctuations of the crystalline lattice",
    "yields a statistical ensemble of trajectories simulated with mbn explorer .",
    "the trajectories then can be used for computing the radiation from the projectiles passing through the crystal . the energy emitted per unit frequency @xmath50 within the cone @xmath51 along the @xmath1 axis",
    "is computed as follows @xmath52 where the sum is carried over the simulated trajectories of the total number @xmath53 , @xmath54 is the solid angle corresponding to the emission angles @xmath55 and @xmath56 , and @xmath57 is the energy per unit frequency and unit solid angle emitted by the projectile moving along the @xmath58th trajectory .",
    "the general equation ( [ mc_simulations.06 ] ) accounts for contributions of _ all the segments _ of simulated trajectories i.e. the segments of the channeling motion as well as the segments of motion out of the channeling regime .",
    "the radiation emitted by the individual projectiles is computed within the quasi - classical approach developed by baier and katkov . for the details of the formalism as well as various applications to radiative processes we refer to the monograph  @xcite ( we also mention appendix a in ref .",
    "@xcite where a number of intermediate steps of the formalism are evaluated explicitly ) .",
    "it is to be pointed out that , along with the classical description of the motion of projectiles , the formalism includes the effect of quantum radiative recoil i.e. it accounts for the change of the projectile energy due to the photon emission .",
    "the impact of the recoil on the radiation is governed by the ratio @xmath59 , and the limit @xmath60 corresponds to purely classical description of the radiative process . for channeling ,",
    "the classical framework is found to be adequate for calculations of the radiation produced in straight , bent and periodically bent crystals by the electrons and positrons with the sub - gev beam energies ( see , e.g , the monograph  @xcite and the references therein ) . for higher beam energies , the quantum recoil can become important , and",
    "has recently be shown  @xcite to significantly influence the radiation produced in sasp bent crystals by the multi - gev electrons and positrons .    to compute the spectral intensity of the radiation produced by the particle moving along the trajectory @xmath61 in the crystal of the thickness @xmath46",
    ", we use the equation  @xcite : @xmath62 , \\label{wkb : eq.04}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 is the fine structure constant , @xmath15 is the charge of the projectile in units of the elementary charge , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the quantities @xmath66 involve the integrals with the phase functions , @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the time of flight through the crystal , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 is the unit vector in the emission direction , and @xmath72 .",
    "the quantum radiative recoil is accounted for by the parameter @xmath73 which vanishes in the classical limit .",
    "within the above described theoretical framework and by exploiting the mbn explorer package , the trajectories and radiation spectra have been simulated for the @xmath74 mev electrons and positrons .",
    "the projectiles were selected as incoming along the ( 110 ) crystallographic planes in a straight silicon crystal , and the sasp bent crystalline profiles were introduced according to eq .",
    "( [ pb_profile : eq ] ) .",
    "the amplitude and period of bending were varied within the intervals @xmath75  ( providing @xmath2 to be smaller than the distance @xmath76  between the ( 110 ) planes in the straight si crystal ) and @xmath77 nm . these ranges include the values used in the recent theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite studies on the channeling and radiation for sasp bending .",
    "the results we have obtained reveal a variety of peculiar features of the channeling in sasp bent si(110 ) .",
    "a qualitative analysis of these results is presented in section [ lengths ] .",
    "the calculated emission spectra cover a wide range of the photon energies , from @xmath78  mev up to @xmath79  mev .",
    "the calculations were performed for the crystal thicknesses @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 micron measured along the beam direction .",
    "the integration over the emission angle @xmath55 was carried out for two particular detector apertures determined by the values @xmath84 and @xmath85  mrad .",
    "the first value is close to one used in the experiments with the @xmath5 mev electron beam at mainz microtron facility @xcite , and is much smaller than the natural emission angle for the beam energy , @xmath86 mrad .",
    "therefore , the corresponding spectra refer to a nearly forward emission . the second angle value , in contrast , significantly exceeds the value @xmath87 providing the emission cone with @xmath88 to collect almost all the radiation from the relativistic projectiles .",
    "the latter situation corresponds to the conditions at the experimental setup at slac  @xcite .",
    "the discussion of the calculated emission spectra is given in section [ spectra ] .",
    "for each type of the projectiles and different sets of the bending amplitudes and periods ( including the case of the straight crystal with @xmath89 ) , the numbers @xmath53 of the simulated trajectories were sufficiently large ( between @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) thus enabling a reliable statistical quantification of the channeling process .",
    "below we define and describe the quantities obtained .    a randomization of the `` entrance conditions '' for the projectiles ( in particular sampling the entrance locations as explained in sect .",
    "[ approach ] ) makes the different projectiles to encounter differently scattering with the crystalline atoms upon entering the crystal . as a result ,",
    "not all the simulated projectiles start moving through the crystal in a channeling mode .",
    "a commonly used parameter to quantify the latter property is _ acceptance _ defined as the ratio @xmath92 of the number @xmath93 of particles captured into the channeling mode once entering the crystal ( the accepted particles ) to the number @xmath53 of the incident particles .",
    "the non - accepted particles experience over - barrier motion unrestricted in the inter - planar directions .",
    "it is order to notice that different theoretical approaches to the interaction of the projectiles with the crystalline environments are also different in criteria distinguishing between the channeling and the over - barrier motions .",
    "for example , the continuous potential approximation @xcite decouples the transverse ( inter - planar ) and longitudinal motions of the projectiles . as a result , it is straightforward to distinguish the channeling projectiles as those with transverse energies not exceeding the height of the inter - planar potential barrier . in our simulations , the projectiles interact , as in reality , with the individual atoms of the crystal .",
    "the inter - planar potential experienced by the projectiles vary rapidly in the course of their motion and couples the transverse and longitudinal degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore , another criteria are required to select the channeling episodes in the projectile s motion .",
    "we assume the channeling to occur when a projectile , while moving in the same channel , changes the sign of the transverse velocity @xmath94 at least two times @xcite .",
    "the latter criteria have also to be supplemented by geometrical definitions of the crystalline channels . here",
    ", we refer to the straight crystals where the positron channels are the volume areas restricted by the neighboring ( 110 ) planes , whereas the electron channels are the areas between the corresponding neighboring mid - planes . for sasp bent crystals ,",
    "the simulations show that , at small values of the bending amplitude , the channeling occur in the above defined channels for the straight crystal .",
    "we will refer to such situation as to the `` conventional '' channeling .",
    "with the amplitudes increasing above some values , the positrons tend to channel in the electron channels for the straight crystal , and vice versa , the electrons become channeling in the positron channels .",
    "the latter situation will be regarded as the `` complementary '' channeling .",
    "we will provide below a quantification for both channeling regimes .",
    "for an accepted projectile , the channeling episode lasts until an event of de - channeling when the projectile leaves the channel .",
    "the de - channeling events occur mostly as cumulative outcomes of multiple collisions of the projectiles with the crystalline constituents .",
    "also , a rare large - angle scattering collision can lead to de - channeling .",
    "de - channeling of the accepted particles is conveniently quantified by the _ penetration depth _",
    "@xmath95 evaluated as the mean longitudinal extension of the primary channeling segments of the trajectories .",
    "the latter segments are those that start at the crystalline entrance and end at the first de - channeling event experienced by the particle inside the crystal @xcite .",
    "the penetration depth can be related to a commonly used de - channeling length @xmath96 . within the framework of the diffusion theory of de - channeling ( see ,",
    "e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the fraction of the channeling particles at large distances @xmath1 from the entrance decays exponentially , @xmath97 , with increasing @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "assuming the decay law to be applicable for all @xmath1 , the penetration depth can be evaluated as the integral @xmath98 and appears to be smaller than @xmath96 for the finite lengths @xmath46 of the crystalline samples . for sufficiently long crystals , @xmath99 ,",
    "the penetration depth approaches the de - channeling length , @xmath100 .",
    "random scattering of the projectiles on the crystalline constituents can also result in a _ re - channeling _ process of capturing the over - barrier particles into the channeling mode of motion .",
    "this process is quantified by the _ re - channeling length _ ,",
    "@xmath101 , defined as an average distance along the crystal between the trajectory points corresponding to the successive events of de - channeling and re - channeling .",
    "we notice that , the re - channeling events are more frequent ( and , correspondingly , the re - channeling lengths are shorter ) for the negatively charged projectiles than these for the positively charged ones . for a qualitative explanation of this feature",
    "we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite .    in a sufficiently long crystal",
    ", the projectiles can experience de - channeling and re - channeling several times in the course of propagation .",
    "these multiple events are accounted for by an additional pair of lengths , the penetration length @xmath102 and the total channeling length @xmath103 that characterize the channeling process in the whole crystal .",
    "the depth @xmath102 is the average extension calculated with respect to _ all _ channeling segments in the trajectories , i.e. not only with respect to the segments that start from the crystalline entrance and are used to evaluate @xmath104 but also including the segments that appear inside the crystal due to the re - channeling events followed by de - channeling .",
    "the total channeling length @xmath103 is computed as the average length with respect to all channeling segments per trajectory .    as a result of re - channeling ,",
    "the projectiles become captured into the channels when possess , statistically , the incident angles of the values smaller than the lindhard s critical angle values @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "therefore , for sufficiently thick crystals , the lengths @xmath102 provide the estimates of the de - channeling lengths @xmath96 for the beams with the emittance values @xmath106 .",
    "the above described statistical quantities have been calculated from the simulations on the channeling for the 855 mev electrons and positrons in the straight and sasp bent si(110 ) crystals of the thickness @xmath107  micron .",
    "the value of the bending period has been fixed at @xmath108  nm , and different values of the bending amplitude @xmath2 have been selected .",

    "the latter is not surprising given that fact that the channels optimally guiding the particles through the crystal are different for the positrons and electrons due to the different character of the the particle - crystal interactions . as the interactions with the crystalline atoms are repulsive for the positrons and attractive for the electrons , the channels guide these particles to move in the domains with low and high content of the crystalline atoms , respectively .",
    "in course of the projectile s motion , the electrons experience scattering on the atoms more frequent as the positrons . as a result , for the electrons the de - channeling process develops faster and results in shorter penetration and channeling lengths than for the positrons .",

    "this effect , together with lowering potential well , leads to a monotonous decrease of the channeling lengths .",

    "for the amplitudes larger than @xmath133   , the densities become comparable with those in the amorphous medium .",
    "together with gradually decreasing potential barrier this yields decreasing channeling lengths .",
