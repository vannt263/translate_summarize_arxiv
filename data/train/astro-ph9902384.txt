    "the development of structure in the universe was well advanced at early times .",
    "quasars have been detected nearly to a redshift of @xmath0 , and the most distant galaxies to even greater redshifts ( dey 1998 ) .",
    "the spectra of high redshift qsos have additionally shown that the intergalactic medium ( igm ) itself had undergone an extensive development of nonlinear structures at early times as well , as revealed by the forest . still unknown , however , is the nature of energetic processes at these early times .",
    "while numerical simulations have shown that the igm is expected to fragment into structures at early times in cold dark matter ( cdm ) dominated cosmologies ( zhang 1998 ) , and even into early galaxies ( governato 1997 ) , the simulations are much less able to predict the efficiency with which gravitationally collapsed objects will emit radiation . although qso sources may account for the photoionizing uv background at high redshifts ( meiksin & madau 1993 ; haardt & madau 1997 ) , it is less clear that they were responsible for the original reionization of the igm .",
    "similarly , although @xmath1 galaxies have been detected , the epoch during which the first generation of stars formed is still poorly constrained ( madau 1998 ; hughes 1998 ) .",
    "although ir observations will permit even higher redshift galaxies and qsos to be observed , detections become increasingly difficult because of the diminution in surface brightness due to cosmological expansion .",
    "this difficulty calls for alternative means to be found for discovering the nature and period of the first major generation of energy - producing sources , the epoch of first light .",
    "i discuss here possible ways in which a square kilometre array ( ska ) radio telescope could reveal the first epochs of energy generation .",
    "because so little is known about the distribution and nature of such sources , the emphasis will be on the physical mechanisms related to their detection .",
    "the means by which the sources are revealed is through their impact on the surrounding neutral igm and the resulting emission or absorption of 21-cm radiation . in the next section ,",
    "i review the wouthuysen - field mechanism for the excitation of 21-cm emission through the scattering of photons , and the heating of the neutral igm by resonant scattering of the photons and soft x - ray heating from early collapsed objects . in  iii , a few scenarios are presented for the possible effects of early generations of radiation sources on the igm and their detection .",
    "the emission or absorption of 21-cm radiation from a neutral igm is governed by the spin temperature @xmath2 of the hydrogen , defined by @xmath3,\\ ] ] where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the singlet and triplet @xmath6 hyperfine levels , @xmath7k , where @xmath8 is the frequency of the 21-cm transition , @xmath9 is planck s constant , and @xmath10 is boltzmann s constant . in the presence of only the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation",
    ", the spin temperature will be the same as the temperature of the cmb , and no emission or absorption relative to the cmb will be detectable .",
    "a mechanism is required that decouples the two temperatures .",
    "this may be achieved by coupling the spin temperature to the kinetic temperature of the gas itself .",
    "two mechanisms are available , collisions between hydrogen atoms ( purcell & field 1956 ) and scattering by photons ( wouthuysen 1952 ; field 1958 ) . the collision - induced coupling between the spin and kinetic temperatures is dominated by the spin - exchange process between the colliding hydrogen atoms . the rate , however , is too small for realistic igm densities at the redshifts of interest , although collisions may be important in dense regions , @xmath11^{-2}$ ] ( madau , meiksin , & rees 1997 ) .",
    "instead the dominant mechanism is likely to be scattering through the wouthuysen - field effect .",
    "this process mixes the hyperfine levels of neutral hydrogen in its ground state via an intermediate transition to the @xmath12 state .",
    "an atom initially in the @xmath6 singlet state may absorb a photon that puts it in an @xmath13 state , allowing it to return to the triplet @xmath6 state by a spontaneous decay . at this point",
    ", the astute student of quantum mechanics will ask how is it possible for electric dipole radiation ( photons ) to induce a spin transition ? the key is spin - orbit coupling : it s the total angular momentum @xmath14 that counts .",
    "( here @xmath15 is the proton spin and @xmath16 is the total electron angular momentum , @xmath17 . )",
    "there are four hyperfine states involved , the @xmath6 singlet @xmath18 and triplet @xmath19 states ( the notation is @xmath20 ) , and the two triplet @xmath13 states @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the selection rule @xmath23 permits the transitions @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and so effectively @xmath26 occurs via one of the @xmath13 states .",
    "when the igm is highly opaque to the scattering of photons , as it is when still neutral , the large number of scatterings of photons in an ambient radiation field will ensure a boltzmann distribution for the photon energies near the frequency , with a temperature given by the kinetic temperature @xmath27 of the igm ( field 1959 ) . in this case",
    ", the spin temperature of the neutral hydrogen becomes in equation  [ eq : tspin ] .",
    "the radio emission may make an important contribution in the vicinity of a radio - loud quasar ( bahcall & ekers 1969 ) , and would itself permit the igm to be detected in 21-cm radiation . ]",
    "@xmath28 where @xmath29  k is the temperature of the cmb ( mather 1994 ) , and @xmath30 is the pumping efficiency . here , @xmath31s@xmath32 is the spontaneous decay rate of the hyperfine transition of atomic hydrogen , @xmath33 is the indirect de - excitation rate of the triplet via absorption of a photon to the @xmath13 level , and @xmath34 was assumed . in the absence of pumping the spin temperature",
    "goes to equilibrium with the 21-cm background radiation field on a timescale @xmath35yr , and neutral intergalactic hydrogen will produce neither an absorption nor emission signature . if @xmath36 is large , @xmath37 , signifying equilibrium with the matter .",
    "a consideration of the net transition rates between the various hyperfine @xmath6 and @xmath13 levels above shows that the @xmath38 transition rate via scattering is related to the total rate @xmath39 by @xmath40 ( field 1958 ) .",
    "this relation and equation  ( [ eq : tspin ] ) are derived in the appendix . in the limit @xmath41 , the fractional deviation in a steady state of the spin temperature from the temperature of",
    "the cmb is @xmath42^{-1}. \\label{eq : ftspin}\\ ] ] there exists then a critical value of @xmath39 which , if greatly exceeded , would drive @xmath43 .",
    "this thermalization rate is ( madau 1997 ) @xmath44      to illustrate the basic principle of the proposed observations , consider a region of neutral material with spin temperature @xmath45 , having angular size on the sky which is large compared to a beamwidth , and radial velocity extent due to the hubble expansion which is larger than the bandwidth .",
    "its intergalactic optical depth at @xmath46 cm along the line of sight , @xmath47 will typically be much less than unity .",
    "the experiment envisaged consists of two measurements , separated in either angle or frequency , such that one measurement , the fiducial , detects no line feature , either because there is no or because @xmath48 , and the second at @xmath49 .",
    "since the brightness temperature through the igm is @xmath50 , the differential antenna temperature observed at the earth between this region and the cmb will be @xmath51 where the 21-cm radiation efficiency is defined as @xmath52 here @xmath53 refers to the neutral fraction of the hydrogen in the region for which @xmath45 .",
    "as long as @xmath2 is much larger than @xmath54 ( hence if there has been significant preheating of the intergalactic gas ) , @xmath55 , and the igm can be observed in emission at a level which is independent of the exact value of @xmath2 . by contrast ,",
    "when @xmath56 ( negligible preheating ) , the differential antenna temperature appears , in absorption , a factor @xmath57 larger than in emission , and it becomes relatively easier to detect intergalactic neutral hydrogen ( scott & rees 1990 ) .",
    "the role of the spin temperature is manifest in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eff ] ) :  when @xmath58 the igm absorbs 21-cm radiation from the cmb , while for @xmath59 the igm emits 21-cm radiation in excess of the cmb . in the absence of decoupling mechanisms , @xmath60",
    ". the presence of photons with sufficient intensity will thus enable the igm to be `` seen . ''",
    "the adiabatic expansion of the universe will generally bring the kinetic temperature of the igm well below the temperature of the cmb .",
    "coupling @xmath2 to @xmath27 will permit the igm to be detectable in absorption .",
    "if there are sources of radiation that heat the igm , however , it may be possible instead to detect the igm in emission .",
    "possible heating sources are soft x - rays from an early generation of qsos or thermal bremsstrahlung emission produced by the ionized gas in the collapsed halos of young galaxies . in cdm - dominated cosmologies",
    ", the latter may be in sufficient number to heat the igm above the cmb temperature by @xmath61 ( madau 1997 ) .",
    "while photons just shortward of the photoelectric edge are absorbed at the ionization front generated by a qso source , photons of much shorter wavelength will be able to propagate to much greater distances .",
    "most of the photoelectric heating of the igm by a qso is accomplished by soft x - rays .",
    "the time required for the radiation at the light front to heat the intergalactic gas to a temperature above that of the cmb is typically 10% of the hubble time .",
    "the region produced by a qso will therefore be preceded by a warming front .",
    "note that , as the x - ray - heated bubbles around qsos will survive as fossils even after the quasar has died , several generations @xmath62 of quasars may actually be responsible for preheating the entire igm . for a typical qso age of @xmath63 yr ,",
    "the required qso comoving space density to heat the entire igm to a temperature above that of the cmb by @xmath64 is @xmath65 . by comparison ,",
    "the comoving space density of bright qsos at @xmath66 is @xmath67 times larger ( warren , hewett , & osmer 1994 ) .",
    "if all bright galaxies undergo a quasar phase , qsos must have a very short lifetime , and @xmath68 .",
    "soft x - rays from a few bright qso sources could then prevent collapsing structures , such as protoclusters while still in the linear regime , from being detected in 21-cm absorption against the cmb .",
    "an additional heating source is the photon scattering itself . the average relative change in a photon s energy @xmath69 after having been scattered by a hydrogen atom at rest is @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the mass of the hydrogen atom .",
    "( it should be noted that this is an approximation valid only for @xmath72 . in the opposite limit",
    ", energy will flow from the atoms to the photons . ) through recoil , energy is transferred from photons to atoms at a rate @xmath73 where @xmath39 is the scattering rate per h atom . in the case of excitation at the thermalization rate",
    "@xmath74 , equation  ( [ eq : edot ] ) becomes @xmath75 ( madau 1997 ) .",
    "the characteristic timescale for heating the medium above the cmb temperature via resonant scattering at this rate is @xmath76 about 20% of the hubble time at @xmath77 .",
    "the result is a finite interval of time during which photons couple the spin temperature to the kinetic temperature of the igm before heating the igm above the cmb temperature .",
    "if sources turned on at redshifts @xmath78 , this interval would present a window in redshift space near @xmath77 that would enable a large fraction of intergalactic gas to be observable at @xmath79mhz in _ absorption _ against the cmb , and so isolate the epoch of first light .",
    "the calculations in this section were done in collaboration with paolo tozzi and piero madau .",
    "two cosmological models are considered , a tilted cold dark matter model ( tcdm ) with @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 , designed to match both cmb measurements on large scales and the constraint on amplitude imposed by galaxy cluster abundances on small , and a flat open cdm model ( ocdm ) with @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 , which similarly matches both constraints . the baryon density in both models",
    "is assumed to be @xmath87 , where @xmath88 .",
    "we consider a scenario in which sources of photons are in sufficient abundance throughout the universe to couple the spin temperature to the kinetic temperature of the igm everywhere .",
    "we further suppose the igm has been preheated to a temperature well above that of the cmb , either by the same photons responsible for the coupling or by soft x - ray sources . in this case , the igm will emit at a rate independent of @xmath2 ( the hyperfine levels will be occupied according to their statistical weights , @xmath89 ) .",
    "because of structure in the igm , the emission will not be uniform .    in figure 1",
    ", we show the range of density fluctuations that would be detectable in a single beam by a square kilometre array interferometer ( skai ) at 160 mhz ( @xmath90 ) , as a function of beam size and frequency band width , and for several assumed integration times .",
    "the detection thresholds are scaled according to a continuum _ rms _ in a 80  mhz band at 160  mhz of 64  njy over an 8 hour integration time ( braun 1998 ; also see www.nfra.nl/skai/science/index.htm ) .",
    "the experiment is based on taking differences between beams .",
    "the dashed lines show curves of constant _ rms _ antenna temperature fluctuation within the igm , @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the _ rms _ relative density fluctuation of the igm for a volume corresponding to a given bandwidth ( @xmath93 $ ] ) and angular size @xmath94 .",
    "here , @xmath95 is the mean antenna temperature from the igm at redshifted 21-cm . at a fixed bandwidth",
    ", the antenna temperature fluctuation increases with decreasing angular scale because @xmath92 increases with decreasing linear scale . because the detected flux is proportional to the solid angle of the beam , the detected signal decreases with decreasing angular scale until it falls below the detection threshold , indicated by the solid lines .",
    "the size of the detectable igm fluctuations differs greatly for the two models .",
    "this is because the growth of density fluctuations ceases early on in an open universe , so that the fluctuations on a given angular scale are much larger in the ocdm model than in tcdm at high redshift .    in a second scenario ,",
    "the spin temperature is again coupled to the igm kinetic temperature everywhere , but the igm has not had time to heat above the cmb temperature .",
    "we then consider the emission signature resulting from a qso soon after it turns on as the medium surrounding it is heated by soft x - rays from the qso .",
    "the experiment in this case is done by differencing beams pointed in regions around the qso with one pointed through the qso region , where both emission and absorption are absent .",
    "an image of the resulting emission for the tcdm model is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the model was computed using hydra ( couchman , thomas , & pearce 1995 ) .",
    "as the warming front produced by the qso expands , a growing amount of the surrounding igm is revealed .",
    "note that , although the qso was placed in the corner of the simulation volume , the figure can equally be viewed as the emission due to heating by a beam of soft x - rays from the qso with an opening angle of @xmath96 .",
    "thus imaging the gas surrounding a qso in 21-cm emission would provide a direct means of measuring the opening angle of qso emission .",
    "it should also be noted that a region of a given fixed density fluctuation will not always yield the same fluctuation in 21-cm emission .",
    "this is because of the dependence of the spin temperature on the temperature of the igm .",
    "only when the igm temperature much exceeds that of the cmb will the 21-cm emission be independent of the igm temperature , according to equation  ( [ eq : eff ] ) . in general , the fluctuations in brightness temperature will depend on both the density fluctuations of the igm and the temperature fluctuations , which in turn depend on the ages and distribution of the sources .",
    "a knowledge of the cosmological density fluctuation spectrum , as may be measured by future cmb missions like map and planck , will then enable the statistical distribution of the sources that heat the igm , whether qsos as here or photons from early stars , to be established using measurements of the fluctuations in the 21-cm sky at high redshift .",
