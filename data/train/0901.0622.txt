    "in particular , we find x=0.820 to be the most stable phase and cooling rate independent , while x=0.833 shows a strong cooling rate dependent nature with transitions found near 8k ( through slow cooling ) and 16k ( through fast cooling ) .",
    "these distinctively different a - af phases found in 0.820 , 0.833 and 0.859 can be reasonably constructed by adding different levels of additional na vacancy to the ideal di - vcancy formed x=11/13=0.846 superstructure of @xmath11a@xmath13@xmath11a@xmath133c.@xcite applying a layered staging model similar to that used in graphite intercalated compounds ( gic),@xcite for example , t@xmath6 phase ( x=0.820 ) can be described as a stage-2 compound , i.e. , where correct stoichiometry is obtained by introducing two more na vacancies into the original ideal @xmath11a@xmath13@xmath11a@xmath133c super unit cell , and these defects create tri - vacancy layers that are sandwiched between every two di - vacancy layers . on the other hand ,",
    "t@xmath7 phase ( x=0.833 ) corresponds to stage-5 , i.e. , tri - vacancy layers are sandwiched between every five di - vacancy layers .",
    "most interestingly , the staging model suggests that the trivacancy layers serve as nucleation centers for the interlayer af ordering .",
    "this picture naturally explains why x=0.820 has a higher t@xmath14 than that of x=0.833 because of its shortest inter - trivacancy layer distance .",

    "16k phase occurs in x=0.832(2 ) when a fast cooling is applied , while it decreases at the expense of 8k phase generation under decreasing cooling rate , although the existence of minor 22k is difficult to avoid completely for samples near the phase separated boundary .",
    "the ratio of the minor 22 k phase to the major 8 k phase in the present x=0.833 sample can be estimated to be 3.6@xmath22 from the entropy change of the small anomaly at 22 k for na@xmath23coo@xmath1 . sodium ion diffusion is active at room temperature for high x samples,@xcite but it freezes below @xmath4200k as indicated by the sharp increase of 1/t@xmath24 for @xmath25na due to na motion.@xcite sample of x=0.832(2 ) must be cooled through the temperature range of 300 - 200k with a rate slower than 10 k / min in order to reach the magnetic ground state that corresponds to 8k magnetic ordering .",

    "the relatively poor ordering of stage-2 for x=0.820 ( t@xmath6=22k ) than that of stage-5 x=0.833 ( t@xmath7=8k ) is interestingly in agreement with the alternating t - q stacking requirement as described by the x=0.71 superstructure model before,@xcite i.e. , tri - vacancy is not favorable in the even - layer within p6@xmath10/mmc symmetry and there must exist mixing stages of 1 and 3 for x=0.820 .",

    "when one and two more na defects per 3c unit ( i.e. , six layers of na ) are introduced into the perfectly ordered original 0.846 = 11/13 superstructure,@xcite two additional stoichiometries of 0.833 = 0.846@xmath32 and 0.820 = 0.846@xmath33 can be introduced , as verified by our x - ray and magnetic measurement results shown above .",
    "when magnetic ordering occurs , spins from itinerant electron or localized electrons near co ions are certain to be affected by the rearrangement of na multi - vacancy clusters in the nearby layers .",
    "in fact the in - plane inter - vacancy cluster distance @xmath11a is nearly twice the inter coo@xmath1 distance .",
    "since every one extra na vacancy introduced into the ideal 3c unit would convert the original layer of di - vacancy formed 2d superstructure into tri - vacancy , we can thus simplify the stacking problem into stack ordering between the di - vacancy ( d ) and tri - vacancy ( t ) layers along the c - direction .",
    "we propose a new staging model as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] to explain such stack ordering , which shows strong resemblance to the staging phenomenon often observed in the 2d intercalated graphite compounds.@xcite the x=0.833 phase which has only one na defect introduced could have a stage-5 construction , while x=0.820 phase of two na defects per 3c unit must have a stage-2 construction , i.e. , there are five and two d - layers sandwiched in between t - layers",
    ".    we can now use the staging picture to interpret the variety of magnetic ordering temperatures observed in the range 0.82 @xmath3 x @xmath3 0.86 .",
    "as discussed previously,@xcite the di - vacancy may localize a carrier on the adjacent co layer , leaving a low density hole gas of density @xmath34 , which is unstable to stoner ferromagnetism",
    ". this may be the origin of the ferromagnetic layers which then order antiferromagnetically between layers to form the a type af ordering .",
    "here we suggest that the driving force for interlayer coupling may lie in the t - layer .",
    "the tri - vacancy has one extra negative charge which lowers the tunneling barrier between the localized holes on the adjacent layers and enhances the antiferromagnetic spin correlation between them .",
    "thus the t - layer may form the nucleation layers to drive the three dimensional af order .",
    "this picture explains why t@xmath6 is 22k for x=0.820 vs. t@xmath7 is 8k for x=0.833 where the spacing between t - layers is much larger .",
    "upon rapid cooling , some stage 4 and stage 6 states may form .",
    "the stage 4 meta - stable phase may be responsible for the intermediate t@xmath14 of 16k .",
    "the hysteretic behavior observed below t@xmath14 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ) could also be explained by either the in - plane fm domain effect or by uncanceled a - type af moments along the c - axis as a result of mixed staging .",
    "the phase separation observed near 0.83 - 0.86 can also be explained using the same stage model . since 0.859=0.846+@xmath35 , i.e.",
    ", one more na ion ( not vacancy ) is introduced into the original ideal x=0.846 phase of @xmath11a@xmath13@xmath11a@xmath133c superstructure , the di - vacancy is converted to a mono - vacancy ( m ) forming a stage 5 stacking .",
    "the hole density on either side of the m - layer is now reduced by @xmath36 and we may expect an even strong tendency toward stoner ferromagnetism .",
    "the higher transition temperature of the co layers adjacent to the m - layer may explain the higher t@xmath8 = 29k for x=0.859 .",
    "in conclusion , we have revised na@xmath0coo@xmath1 phase diagram in the range of 0.71 - 0.86 using electrochemically fine tuned single crystal samples . the puzzling and inconsistent measurement results in this range before have been clarified and interpreted as a result of phase separation and staging phenomena . a direct link between the high temperature na ion ( vacancy ) ordering and the low temperature magnetic properties have been established .",
