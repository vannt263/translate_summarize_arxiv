    "recent observational data indicate that our universe is undergoing accelerated expansion .",
    "the standard modern cosmological models consider the total energy density of the universe to be dominated today by the densities of two components : dark matter ( which has an attractive gravitational effect like usual matter ) , and dark energy ( a kind of vacuum energy with a negative pressure ) , which drives the accelerated expansion  @xcite .",
    "even more , observational data seem to indicate that the universe today may be dominated by an exotic kind of dark energy which has a very strong negative pressure , denominated phantom fluid since it violates all energy conditions  @xcite .",
    "the real nature of the dark sector remains unknown .",
    "most considered dark energy models present an accelerated expansion due to the presence of a quintessence ( described by a canonical scalar field ) , or a phantom field ( described by a scalar field with a negative kinetic term ) , among others .",
    "it appears in this kind of models that the energy density of dark energy is almost equivalent to that of the matter in the current or in recent times although they scale independently during all the cosmic evolution .",
    "this situation is referred to as the  coincidence problem \" . to solve the coincidence problem",
    "many attempts have been done .",
    "of special interest are interacting cosmological models since they may alleviate or even solve the coincidence problem  @xcite .",
    "we shall refer to this type of cosmological models below in this section .    in the framework of general relativity , for modeling the present state of the universe ,",
    "usually the cosmological models consider two cosmic fluids as sources for the einstein field equations : one fluid for the dark matter sector , where is included the standard visible matter , and another cosmic fluid for the dark energy sector .",
    "usually the dark matter is described as a pressureless ideal fluid , while the dark energy may be described by a cosmological constant , or perfect fluid or scalar fields  @xcite .",
    "the consideration of two fluids in einstein field equations leads to @xmath19 where @xmath20 , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the energy ",
    "momentum tensors of the two fluids . in a homogeneous and isotropic frw universe @xmath23 filled with two fluids @xmath24 and @xmath25 ,",
    "the friedmann equation is given by @xmath26 from eq .",
    "( [ eeq ] ) it follows that both fluids together form a system that has a conserved four  momentum , implying that the two components @xmath24 and @xmath25 satisfy the following conservation equation : @xmath27 it is clear that the single two - fluid conservation equation  ( [ coneq ] ) implies that the sum of the two fluids is conserved . in order to find solutions one may separate this single two - fluid conservation equation into two conservation equations for a system of two single fluids : @xmath28 the physical interpretation is that each of two fluid components is conserved , evolving separately according to standard conservation laws",
    "however , this splitting into two conservation equations is a condition imposed on the conservation equation  ( [ coneq ] ) and thus leads to a particular set of solutions to einstein field equations .",
    "if we apply this picture to the dark sector we conclude that dark matter and dark energy are conserved separately , and if the pressures are given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are constant parameters , then the solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ coneq0 ] ) are given by @xmath32 implying that energy density of dark matter has the form @xmath33 .",
    "however , since the real natures of dark matter and dark energy remain unknown , one can consider more general scenarios where dark matter and dark energy should not conserve separately and are coupled to each other .",
    "one coupling mechanism can be formally introduced into the friedmann equations by defining an interacting term @xmath34 in the following form : @xmath35 note that the case @xmath36 is interpreted as a transfer of energy from fluid @xmath37 to fluid @xmath38 . then , for the case @xmath39 , we should have an energy transfer from fluid @xmath38 to fluid @xmath37 . in order to find solutions the form of this phenomenological interacting term @xmath9 must be postulated .",
    "usually one of the following types is considered : @xmath40 , @xmath13 , @xmath41 , @xmath14 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the energy densities of dark matter and dark energy respectively .",
    "as we stated above , the introduction of this type of coupling between components of the dark sector offers to the standard cosmology a potential solution to the cosmic coincidence problem by requiring the ratio of matter and dark energy densities to be stable against perturbations at late times  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it also must be noticed that this type of coupling is motivated by considerations of high energy particle physics  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the assumption of a gravitational coupling between these two fluids in the form of eqs .",
    "( [ q ] ) is too close to the physical character of the two - fluid conservation equation since the total energy is conserved always satisfying the conservation equation  ( [ coneq ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , one can look for a general solution to einstein equations by using the general properties encoded into the two - fluid conservation equation by choosing another more natural way to solve the friedmann equations  ( [ friedmann equation ] ) and  ( [ coneq ] ) , namely by postulating the form of one of the energy densities based on physical considerations and then find the whole solution by means of the conservation equation  ( [ coneq ] ) . in this paper",
    "this method will be applied .",
    "we shall consider friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmologies filled with two ideal barotropic fluids with constant state parameters , where one of the energy densities is given by a sum of two powers of the scale factor .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , we shall define a scaling cosmology as one in which the energy densities @xmath0 and @xmath1 scale exactly as powers of the scale factor in the form @xmath42 and @xmath43 with @xmath44 constant , leading to the ratio of energy densities of the form @xmath45 .",
    "on the other hand , we shall use the term quintessence not only for a matter content in the form of a scalar field as is generally used , but also for any kind of substance having the equation of state @xmath46 .",
    "the outline of the present paper is as follows : in section ii we obtain the general solution for the chosen form of one of energy densities . in section iii",
    "we study some specific two - fluid interacting cosmologies , considered before in the literature , that are included in the obtained cosmological models as particular cases . in section iv some features of the studied cosmological models are discussed and a three - fluid interpretation is given .",
    "finally , section v presents some concluding remarks .",
    "as we stated in the previous section we shall postulate the form of one of the energy densities to build a viable cosmological model which is able to lead to an accelerated expansion and solves or alleviates the coincidence problem . in order to do this",
    "the model must successfully reproduce some important cosmological scenarios considered before in standard cosmology .",
    "for example , frw cosmologies filled with a single fluid @xmath47 with equation of state @xmath48 have an energy density of the form @xmath49 , and those with two non - interacting fluids , as we have seen above , have the energy densities given by  ( [ nif ] ) .",
    "another type of frw cosmologies , which provides us with a way to approach the coincidence problem , has energy densities which scale exactly as powers of the scale factor , so they are considered to be given by @xmath50 and @xmath51 in order to have @xmath52 .",
    "just these types of cosmological scenarios we want to generalize .",
    "the starting point is the assumption that one of energy densities , say @xmath0 , depends on the scale factor as @xmath53 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are constants . then substituting the expression  ( [ rho1 ] ) into the conservation equation  ( [ coneq ] ) we obtain for the other energy density    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is a constant of integration .",
    "it is clear that expressions  ( [ rho1 ] ) and  ( [ rho2 ] ) may lead to an asymptotically scaling behavior of energy densities at early and late times , depending on which term in @xmath56 and @xmath57 is dominating at each epoch .    normalizing expressions  ( [ rho1 ] ) and  ( [ rho2 ] ) to the present values @xmath58 and",
    "@xmath59 ( the present value of the scale factor is normalized as @xmath60 ) we can express the constants @xmath5 and @xmath6 through the model parameters as    @xmath61,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath62,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    respectively .",
    "now , by taking into account eqs .",
    "( [ rho1 ] ) and  ( [ rho2 ] ) , we can find the scale factor by solving the friedmann equation  ( [ friedmann equation ] ) which takes the form @xmath63 where @xmath64 note that for @xmath65 the energy density  ( [ rho2 ] ) takes the following form : @xmath66",
    "as we stated above , in recent years the interacting interpretation of the conservation equation  ( [ coneq ] ) has received increasing attention , which is mainly preferred by cosmologists because it helps to study the coincidence problem by generating two - fluid cosmological solutions .",
    "clearly , for the solution found in the previous section , we can introduce into consideration an interacting term by computing @xmath34 with the help of eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) .",
    "thus , by substituting eq .",
    "( [ rho1 ] ) into the first expression of eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) ( or eq .  ( [ rho2 ] ) into the second expression of eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) ) , we obtain that the interacting term associated with our solution  ( [ rho1 ] ) and  ( [ rho2 ] ) is given by @xmath67 note that we obtain the case of two non - interacting fluids  ( [ nif ] ) by taking @xmath68 and @xmath69 , which implies that the interaction term @xmath70 .",
    "notice that from the general solution  ( [ rho1 ] ) and  ( [ rho2 ] ) we have that for @xmath71 and @xmath72 the energy densities take the form @xmath73 where the interaction term is given by @xmath74 clearly , if @xmath75 we obtain the standard case of a frw cosmology filled with a single fluid .",
    "the interaction in this case exists only due to the presence of different pressures @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "let us now impose on the general expressions for energy densities  ( [ rho1 ] ) , ( [ rho2 ] ) and the interacting term  ( [ qsolucion ] ) some types of specific interactions considered in the literature . in general the considered interacting terms are functions of the energy densities multiplied by a function with units of inverse of time ( generally @xmath78 . as we quoted in the introduction",

    "note that if @xmath117 and @xmath118 we have that @xmath121 and then in this case the consideration of dark energy is excluded",

    "one finds that the equilibrium between dark matter and dark energy , i.e. @xmath128 , corresponds to @xmath129 while the accelerated expansion begins at @xmath130 clearly these two expressions do not coincide .",

    "for @xmath133 we have that @xmath134 and then the acceleration begins when the dark energy component already dominates in the universe .",
    "it is interesting to remark that this kind of behavior also is observed in power law cosmologies studied in ref .",
