    "contact structures for odd - dimensional manifolds arise naturally on boundaries of symplectic manifolds via the notion of _ convexity_. a symplectic manifold @xmath6 is said to have * convex boundary * if , on a neighborhood of  @xmath7 , there exists a vector field  @xmath8 that points transversely outward at  @xmath7 and whose flow is a symplectic dilation , i.e.  @xmath9 . writing @xmath10 , the co - oriented hyperplane field @xmath11",
    "then satisfies a certain `` maximal integrability '' condition which makes it a _ contact structure _ , and up to isotopy , it depends only on the symplectic structure of @xmath6 near  @xmath12 , not on the choice of vector field  @xmath8 .",
    "given the above relationship , it is interesting to ask which isomorphism classes of contact manifolds @xmath13 do _ not _ arise as boundaries of compact symplectic manifolds , i.e.  which ones are not _ symplectically fillable_. a variety of obstructions to symplectic filling are known , and the following two examples give some hint as to the diversity of such results :    * lisca @xcite used the seiberg - witten monopole invariants of kronheimer and mrowka @xcite together with donaldson s theorem on the intersection forms of smooth @xmath2-manifolds @xcite to find examples of oriented @xmath0-manifolds that admit no symplectically fillable contact structures . * the author @xcite used punctured holomorphic curve techniques to show that a contact @xmath0-manifold has no symplectic filling if it is supported by a planar open book whose monodromy is not a product of right - handed dehn twists .",
    "( see @xcite for some applications of this result . )",
    "one common feature of the above examples is that they depend fundamentally on the _ global _ properties of the manifolds involved .",
    "in contrast , one can also consider filling obstructions which are _ local _ , in the sense that they answer the following question :    _ what kinds of contact subdomains can never exist in the convex boundary of a compact symplectic manifold ? _    the first known example of a symplectic filling obstruction was essentially local in this sense : gromov @xcite and eliashberg @xcite established that contact type boundaries of symplectic @xmath2-manifolds can never contain an _ overtwisted disk _ , and significantly , the resulting distinction between so - called `` overtwisted '' and `` tight '' contact structures has played a pivotal role in classification questions for contact structures in dimension three .",
    "this non - fillability result can be rephrased in terms of a certain @xmath0-dimensional contact domain with boundary that we call a _ lutz tube _ :",
    "this is a solid torus @xmath14 with a radially symmetric contact structure that makes a half - twist along radii from the center to the boundary ( see figure  [ fig : lutztube ] and definition  [ defn : lutztube ] ) .",
    "one convenient consequence of eliashberg s classification result @xcite is that a closed contact @xmath0-manifold contains an overtwisted disk if and only if it contains a lutz tube , thus the latter may be regarded as the prototypical example of a local filling obstruction .",
    "a more general local filling obstruction is furnished by the so - called _ giroux torsion domain _ , a thickened torus @xmath15 \\times t^2 $ ] with a @xmath16-invariant contact structure that makes one full twist from one end of the interval to the other ( see figure  [ fig : girouxtorsiondomain ] and definition  [ defn : girouxtorsion ] ) .",
    "contact manifolds containing such an object are said to have _ giroux torsion _ , and",
    "the fact that they are not fillable in general is a comparatively recent result , due to gay @xcite .",
    "giroux torsion domains have also played an important role in the classification of contact structures , most notably through the work of colin , giroux and honda @xcite .",
    "contact planes twist around the radii emerging from the central axis of a lutz tube .",
    "the picture also shows an embedded @xmath5-holomorphic plane asymptotic to a reeb orbit of small period in a morse - bott family ( arrows indicate the reeb vector field ) ; every lutz tube contains such planes , which are the reason why the contact homology of an overtwisted contact manifold vanishes . ]     in a giroux torsion domain @xmath15 \\times t^2 $ ] , contact planes twist around segments in the @xmath15$]-direction .",
    "such domains are foliated by @xmath5-holomorphic cylinders asymptotic to morse - bott reeb orbits . ]",
    "these two examples of local filling obstructions create the intuitive impression that contact manifolds tend to become non - fillable whenever they contain regions where the contact planes exhibit some threshold amount of _",
    "twisting_. in this paper we shall introduce a geometric formalism that makes this notion precise , and in so doing , greatly expands the known repertoire of local filling obstructions .",
    "we will demonstrate in particular that the examples above occupy the first two levels in an infinite _ hierarchy _",
    ": for each integer @xmath1 , we shall define a special class of compact contact @xmath0-manifolds , possibly with boundary , which we call _ planar @xmath3-torsion domains _ , such that the lutz tube and giroux torsion domain are special cases with @xmath17 and  @xmath18 respectively .",
    "our use of the word `` hierarchy '' is not incidental , as it turns out that a planar torsion domain yields quantifiably stricter or less strict filling obstructions depending on its _ order _ , i.e.  the integer  @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , the overtwisted contact manifolds are precisely those which have planar @xmath19-torsion , and these can be thought of as the `` most non - fillable '' among all contact @xmath0-manifolds , while the fillable contact manifolds are the `` tightest , '' and those which have only higher orders of planar torsion are non - fillable but are in some sense `` tighter '' than their lower order counterparts .",
    "the definition of planar torsion , which will be given in a precise form in  [ sec : definitions ] , combines two simple notions that are fundamental in contact topology : open book decompositions supporting contact structures , as introduced by giroux @xcite , and the contact fiber sum along codimension  2 contact submanifolds , originally due to gromov @xcite and geiges @xcite . roughly speaking",
    ", a planar @xmath3-torsion domain is a compact contact @xmath0-manifold @xmath13 , possibly with boundary , that contains a non - empty set of disjoint pre - lagrangian tori dividing it into two pieces :    * a _ planar piece _ @xmath20 , which is disjoint from @xmath21 and looks like a connected open book with some binding components blown up and/or attached to each other by contact fiber sums .",
    "the pages must have genus zero and @xmath22 boundary components .",
    "* the _ padding _",
    "@xmath23 , which contains @xmath21 and consists of one or more arbitrary open books , again with some binding components blown up or fiber summed together .",
    "planar torsion domains are thus examples of what are called _ partially planar domains _ , a notion that was first hinted at in @xcite .",
    "the interior of such a domain  @xmath12 always contains a special set @xmath24 of pre - lagrangian tori which arise by blowing up binding components of open books : we refer to these tori all together as the _ interface _ of  @xmath13 . postponing the exact definitions until  [ sec : definitions ] , let us for now merely point out that in a lutz tube @xmath25 ( figure  [ fig : lutztube ] ) , the planar piece is some smaller solid torus @xmath26 for @xmath27 , and the pages of the blown up open book in  @xmath20 are the disks @xmath28 . likewise , the planar piece in a giroux torsion domain @xmath29 \\times t^2 $ ] ( figure  [ fig : girouxtorsiondomain ] ) is a smaller thickened torus @xmath30 \\times t^2 $ ] for @xmath31 , foliated by cylindrical pages of the form @xmath32",

    "we will see that in the more general definition , the topology of the planar piece and the whole domain may differ from each other considerably , and interface tori may also be found in the interior of the planar piece or the padding .",
    "some simple examples of the form @xmath34 are shown in figure  [ fig : torsiondomains ] .",
    "we should also mention that the idea of decomposing contact manifolds in this way via fiber sums of open books has further applications beyond filling obstructions , e.g.  it is used in @xcite to define a `` blown up '' version of eliashberg s capping construction @xcite , producing a wide range of existence results for non - exact symplectic cobordisms .",

    "if the image is  @xmath7 and @xmath53 maps the orientation of  @xmath12 to the natural boundary orientation , then we say @xmath6 is a ( weak or strong ) * symplectic filling * of  @xmath13 .",

    "though our proof of non - fillability will not depend on it , the implication that @xmath13 is not strongly fillable follows from the above statement due to a result of etnyre and honda @xcite , that every contact @xmath0-manifold is _ concave _ fillable : this means that strong fillings can always be capped off to produce closed symplectic @xmath2-manifolds containing contact type hypersurfaces .",
    "we will also prove an algebraic counterpart to the above result in terms of embedded contact homology , or `` ech '' for short ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",

    "the result implies another proof that planar torsion is a filling obstruction , albeit a very indirect one : under the isomorphism of taubes @xcite , the ech contact invariant corresponds to a similar invariant in seiberg - witten theory , whose vanishing gives a filling obstruction due to results of kronheimer and mrowka @xcite",
