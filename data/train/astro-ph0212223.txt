    "future cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) experiments such as the map  @xcite and later the planck satellites  @xcite will provide full sky maps of cmb anisotropies ( up to the galactic cut ) .",

    "a series of tests to detect the topology , including the use of the angular power spectrum  @xcite , the distribution of matched patterns such as circles  @xcite , correlation of antipodal points  @xcite and non gaussianity  @xcite have been proposed ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews of cmb methods to search for the topology ) .",
    "the study of the detectability of the topology by any of these methods first requires simulating maps with the topological signature for a large set of topologies .",
    "these maps will allow one to test the detection methods , estimate their run time , and , once all sources of noise are added , determine to what extent a given method detects the topological signal ( in the same spirit as the investigation of the `` crystallographic '' methods based on galaxy catalogs  @xcite ) .    in a simply connected , namely the one in which the only open sets are the empty set and the entire set @xmath0 .",
    "] , spatially homogeneous and isotropic universe , the angular correlation function depends only on the angle between the two directions and the coefficients @xmath1 of the decomposition of the temperature fluctuation in spherical harmonics , which are uncorrelated for different sets of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "multi - connectedness breaks the global isotropy and sometimes the global homogeneity of the universe , except in projective space ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "consequently , the cmb temperature angular correlation function will depend on the two directions of observation , not only on their relative angle , and possibly on the position of the observer .",
    "this induces correlations between the @xmath1 of different @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "such correlations are hidden when one considers only the angular correlation function and its coefficients , the so - called @xmath4 , in a legendre polynomial decomposition , because they pick up only the isotropic part of the information and are therefore a poor indicator of the topology .",
    "this work aims to detail the whole computation of the correlation matrix @xmath5 which encodes all the topological properties of the cmb , and from which one can compute the usual @xmath4 , simulate maps , and so on .",
    "the study of the detectability of a topological signal ( if it exists ) in forthcoming cmb datasets requires simulating high quality maps containing the topological signature for a wide class of topologies . up to now , most cmb studies considered only compact euclidean spaces  @xcite and some compact hyperbolic spaces  @xcite , and focused mainly on the @xmath4 .",
    "the approach developed in this article , and first introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , is well suited to simulate the required cmb maps in any topology once the eigenmodes of the laplacian have been determined .",
    "it paves the way to the simulation of maps for a wide range of topologies , particularly spherical ones .",
    "recent measurements of the density parameter @xmath6 imply that the observable universe is `` approximately flat '' , perhaps with a slight curvature .",
    "the exact constraint on the total density parameter obtained from cmb experiments depends on the priors used during the data analysis .",
    "for example with a prior on the nature of the initial conditions , the hubble parameter and the age of the universe , recent analysis of the dasi , boomerang , maxima and dmr data  @xcite lead to @xmath7 at @xmath8 level , and to @xmath9 at @xmath8 level if one takes into account only the dasi , boomerang and cbi data . including stronger priors can indeed sharpen the bound . for instance , including information respectively on large scale structure and on supernovae data leads to @xmath10 and @xmath11 at @xmath8 level while including both finally leads to @xmath12 .",
    "this has been recently improved by the archeops balloon experiments  @xcite which get , with a prior on the hubble constant , @xmath13 . in conclusion , it is fair to assert that current cosmological observations set a reliable bound @xmath14 .",
    "these results are consistent with friedmann - lematre universe models with spherical , flat or hyperbolic spatial sections . in the spherical and hyperbolic cases",
    ", @xmath15 implies that the curvature radius must be larger than the horizon radius . in all three cases",
    " spherical , flat , and hyperbolic  the universe may be simply connected or multiply connected .",
    "+ the possibility of detecting the topology of a nearly flat universe was discussed in ref .",
    "it was noted that the chances of detecting a multiply connected topology are worst in a large hyperbolic universe .",
    "the reason is that the typical translation distance between a cosmic source and its nearest topological image seems to be on the order of the curvature radius , and that when @xmath15 the distance to the last scattering surface is less than the half of that distance .",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite for some studies on detectability of nearly flat hyperbolic universes . in a multiply",
    "connected flat universe the topology scale is completely independent of the horizon radius , because euclidean geometry  unlike spherical and hyperbolic geometry  has no preferred scale and admits similarities .",
    "note that in the euclidean case , there are only ten compact topologies , which reduces and simplifies the analysis ( in particular regarding the computation of the eigenmodes of the laplacian ) . in a spherical universe",
    "the topology scale depends on the curvature radius , but , in contrast to the hyperbolic case , as the topology of a spherical manifold gets more complicated , the typical distance between two images of a single cosmic source decreases .",
    "no matter how close @xmath6 is to @xmath16 , only a finite number of spherical topologies are excluded from detection .",
    "the particular case of the detectability of lens spaces was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , which also considers the detectability of hyperbolic topologies .",
    "+ at present , the status of the constraints on the topology of the universe is still very preliminary .",
    "regarding locally euclidean spaces , it was shown on the basis of the cobe data that in the case of a vanishing cosmological constant the size of the fundamental domain of a 3-torus has to be larger than @xmath17  @xcite , where the length @xmath18 is related to the smallest wavenumber @xmath19 of the fundamental domain , which induces a suppression of fluctuations on scales beyond the size @xmath18 of the fundamental domain .",
    "this constraint does not exclude a toroidal universe since there can be up to eight copies of the fundamental cell within our horizon .",
    "this constraint relies mainly on the fact that the smallest wavenumber is @xmath19 , which induces a suppression of fluctuations on scales beyond the size of the fundamental domain .",
    "this result was generalized to all euclidean manifolds in ref .",
    "a non - vanishing cosmological constant induces more power on large scales , via the integrated sachs - wolfe effect .",
    "for instance if @xmath20 and @xmath21 , the constraint is relaxed to allow for 49 copies of the fundamental cell within our horizon .",
    "the constraint is also milder in the case of compact hyperbolic manifolds and it was shown  @xcite that the angular power spectrum was consistent with the cobe data on multipoles ranging from 2 to 20 for the weeks and thurston manifolds .",
    "another approach , based on the method of images , was developed in  @xcite .",
    "only one spherical space using this method of images was considered in the literature , namely projective space  @xcite .",
    "the tools developed in this article , as well as in our preceding works  @xcite , will let us fill the gap regarding the simulation of cmb maps in spherical universes .",
    "technically , in standard relativistic cosmology , the universe is described by a friedmann - lematre spacetime with locally isotropic and homogeneous spatial sections .",
    "these spatial sections can be defined as constant density or time hypersurfaces .",
    "with such a splitting , the equations of evolution of the cosmological perturbations , which give birth to the large scale structures of the universe , reduce to a set of coupled differential equations involving the laplacian .",
    "this system is conveniently solved in fourier space . in the case of a multiply connected universe ,",
    "we visualize space as the quotient @xmath22 of a simply connected space @xmath0 ( which is just a @xmath23-sphere @xmath24 , a euclidean space @xmath25 , or a hyperbolic space @xmath26 , depending on the curvature ) by a group @xmath27 of symmetries of @xmath0 that is discrete and fixed point free . the group @xmath27 is called the holonomy group . to solve the evolution equations we must first determine the eigenmodes @xmath28}_{{k}\\,{}}}$ ] and eigenvalues @xmath29 of the laplacian on @xmath22 through the generalized helmholtz equation @xmath30}_{{k}\\ , { } } } = -\\kappa_k^2 { \\upsilon^{[{\\gamma}]}_{{k}\\ , { } } } , \\ ] ] with @xmath31 where @xmath32 indexes the set of eigenmodes , the constant @xmath33 is positive , zero or negative according to whether the space is spherical , flat or hyperbolic , respectively , in the spherical case nor is it assumed to be @xmath34 in the hyperbolic case .",
    "thus our eigenvalues may differ numerically from those found in the mathematical literature , although of course they agree up to a fixed constant multiple @xmath35 . ] and the boundary conditions are compatible with the given topology .",
    "the laplacian in eq .",
    "( [ helmotz1 ] ) is defined as @xmath36 , @xmath37 being the covariant derivative associated with the metric @xmath38 of the spatial sections ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath23 ) .",
    "the eigenmodes of @xmath22 , on which any function on @xmath22 can be developed , respect the boundary conditions imposed by the topology .",
    "that is , the eigenmodes of @xmath22 correspond precisely to those eigenmodes of @xmath0 that are invariant under the action of the holonomy group @xmath27 .",
    "thus any linear combination of such eigenmodes will satisfy , by construction , the required boundary conditions . in this way we visualize the space of eigenmodes of @xmath42 as a subspace of the space of eigenmodes of @xmath0 , namely the subspace that is invariant under the action of @xmath27 .",
    "the computational challenge is to find this @xmath27-invariant subspace and construct an orthonormal basis for it . in the case of flat manifolds",
    "the eigenmodes of @xmath43 can be found analytically . in the case of hyperbolic manifolds , many numerical investigations of the eigenmodes of @xmath44",
    "have been performed  @xcite . in the case of spherical manifolds , the eigenmodes of @xmath45",

    "the sum over @xmath2 runs from @xmath51 to infinity if the universal covering space is non - compact ( i.e. , hyperbolic or euclidean ) .",
    "the @xmath48\\,{s}}_{{k}\\,{\\ell}\\,{m}}}$ ] coefficients can be determined analytically for euclidean manifolds . in the case of a spherical manifold ,",
    "the modes are discrete , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a nonnegative integer ( the cases @xmath54 and @xmath55 correspond to pure gauge modes  @xcite ) , so that @xmath56 , and the sum over @xmath2 is finite and runs from 0 to @xmath53 since the multiplicity of a mode @xmath32 is at most its multiplicity in the universal cover , which is @xmath57 . among spherical spaces , the case of prism and lens spaces are the simplest since one can determine these coefficients analytically  @xcite .",
    "the worst situation is that of compact hyperbolic manifolds , which is analogous to the euclidean case since the universal covering @xmath25 is not compact but for which no analytical forms are known for the eigenmodes .",
    "one then needs to rely on numerical computations ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "our preceding works provided a full classification of spherical manifolds  @xcite and developed methods to compute the eigenmodes of the laplacian in them  @xcite . among all",

    "third , several events can alter the photons energy and trajectory while travelling toward us . in particular , they can be slightly disturbed from their trajectory ( lensing ) and , more importantly , they can exchange energy when they cross time - varying potential wells .",

    "by contrast , the doppler effect will explicitly depend on the direction of observation .",
    "if one observes two directions which correspond to the same point of the last scattering surface and which form a small angle , then one expects that the doppler contribution will be almost the same .",
    "if the matching points are @xmath286 degrees from each other , then one expects on average no correlation at all , whereas the doppler effect between two antipodal points will become anti - correlated . finally ,",
    "since photons originating from the same emission region but observed from different directions will travel through different regions of space , they will undergo different integrated sachs - wolfe effects , so that no significant correlations are expected from this effect , which is therefore considered a noise term for our purposes .",
    "actually , one aim of this work is precisely to compute the typical amount of correlation one can expect on pairs of circles .",
    "note that this correlation is likely to depend on scale : on large scales , one should be annoyed by the late integrated sachs - wolfe effect ; between the sachs - wolfe plateau and the first doppler peak ( and , at a lesser extent , at every dip between two doppler peaks ) , the doppler effect dominates ; at the first peak , there is usually ( especially when the matter content is low ) a significant contribution of the early integrated sachs - wolfe effect ( see fig .",
    "[ figdec ] ) ; at very small scales , one feels the finite width of the last scattering surface ( see below ) , etc .",
    "also , as explained above , the relative position of the circles will play a role because of the doppler contribution .",
    "it is therefore interesting to look at the best way to find matching circles on a realistic cmb map .",
    "we leave this important point to future work  @xcite .",
    "the second ( and probably less important ) effect that reduces the correlation between the circles is the finite width of the last scattering surface . as far as we know",
    ", this effect has not yet been carefully analyzed .",
    "it plays a role when one looks at fluctuations on scales smaller than the projected width of the last scattering surface . in this case",
    "when looking in a given direction , one picks up fluctuations which are situated `` on one side '' of the last scattering surface , but for pairs of circles , one sees opposite sides of the last scattering surface . on larger scales , the effect is negligible as one averages temperature fluctuations on regions much larger than the thickness of the last scattering surface .",
    "we now outline some of the results we have already obtained from our simulations .",
    "the main aim of this section is to provide a series of tests to check our simulations .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the structure of the correlation matrix @xmath287 as well as a search for accurate tests to detect the topology are left for future work  @xcite .      in all the simulations we performed ,",
    "we have considered a flat @xmath288cdm model with @xmath289 , a hubble parameter of @xmath290 with @xmath291 , a baryon density @xmath292 and a spectral index @xmath293 . with this choice of cosmological parameters ,",
    "the hubble radius is @xmath294 , the `` horizon '' radius ( under the hypothesis of a radiation dominated universe at early times ) is @xmath295 , and the radius of the last scattering surface is @xmath296 .",
    "the volume of the observable universe is therefore @xmath297 .",
    "let us first compare the @xmath4 in the simply connected topology to the @xmath4 in a torus ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "as expected , we see a cutoff at some angular size which corresponds to the angular size of the torus on the last scattering surface .",
    "this corresponds to the multipole @xmath298 where @xmath18 is the length of the cubic torus fundamental domain  @xcite . note that even when the torus is larger than the size of the observable universe , the spectrum exhibits a loss of power on large scales",
    "this is because the harrison - zeldovich spectrum exhibits a significant amount of power at large scales ( by definition , it is scale invariant ) , and in practice , the modes that contribute to the quadrupole of the cmb anisotropies can be as large as ten times the size of the observable universe ( the exact number depends mostly on the spectral index and on the amplitude of the integrated sachs - wolfe term ) .",
    "therefore , this leaves hope to detect the topology `` beyond the horizon '' where the circles method would fail .",
    "it is not easy to predict the amplitude of the power at scales larger than the cutoff because it depends mostly on the amplitude of the integrated sachs - wolfe effect , which is difficult to estimate even when the topology is multiconnected .",
    "another consequence of a multiconnected topology are oscillations in the spectrum .",
    "these come both from the fact that there is a sharp cutoff in the spectrum ( which causes oscillations in fourier / legendre space ) and that the spectrum is `` spiky '' on large scales .",
    "should we consider a simply connected universe with a cutoff at some scales , then the corresponding @xmath4 would be less irregular . finally , note that on small angular scales , the spectrum tends to behave as in the simply connected case , but computing this scale remains an open problem at the moment .",
    "so far , we have considered only the @xmath4 , which represent only some average of the diagonal part of the correlation matrix .",
    "the true diagonal part of the correlation matrix is given by the @xmath299 which represent the variance of the @xmath1 .",
    "an example of their behavior is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for the same topologies as in fig .",
    "several features appear on this figure .",
    "first and most importantly , the dispersion in the variance of the @xmath1 at fixed @xmath2 is very large .",
    "it appears that it is maximal at the cutoff scale @xmath300 , where the dispersion in the variance of the @xmath1 can be as large as two orders of magnitude .",
    "this dispersion slowly decays at larger multipoles , where one `` tends '' ( in the sense of observable quantities ) towards the simply connected case , and surprisingly also decays at scales larger than the cutoff . with the hypothesis of a multi - connected universe ,",
    "this dispersion would be ( incorrectly ) interpreted as non gaussianity . since at present",
    "no non gaussianity or anisotropy was observed in the data , this allows new constraints of the size of the fundamental domain .",
    "we did not find any convenient way to represent the off - diagonal terms of the correlation matrix .",
    "we therefore switch to showing and analyzing some realizations corresponding to the numerically computed correlation matrix . in what follows ,",
    "we have fixed the size of the torus to @xmath265 .",
    "we therefore have @xmath301 copies of the torus in the observable universe , and from eq .",
    "( [ cutoffl ] ) this corresponds to @xmath302 , as can be checked in fig .",
    "although such a model is now excluded by the data  @xcite , we analyze it in detail mostly for pedagogical purposes ( and also because the computing time scales as @xmath303 ) . in the case where the torus , or more generally the fundamental domain , is smaller than the last scattering surface",
    ", one expects to see pairs of circles where the temperature is correlated  @xcite .",
    "seeing these circles at their expected position is therefore the most crucial test of the procedure outlined in secs .",
    "[ sec_cmb],[sec_modes],[sec_simulation ] .",
    "as already announced , the aim here is not to derive a detailed procedure to detect these circles , but to check our algorithm and to explore some of the properties of these matching circles . here , we have @xmath304 .",
    "one therefore expects to have @xmath305 pairs of circles and @xmath283 pairs of points having correlated temperature , where @xmath306 , @xmath307 , @xmath308 , @xmath309 , @xmath310 , @xmath311 , @xmath312 , @xmath313 , and @xmath314 plus all permutations and sign changes among each triplet @xmath315 .",
    "the pairs of points correspond to the case where the intersection between the last scattering surface and its translate reduces to almost a single point , as is the case for @xmath316 and its permutations and sign changes . ] . in order to see the circles , it is convenient to show the last scattering surface as a sphere seen from the outside and to look at its intersection with itself after a translation of the form @xmath317 , as shown in figs .",
    "[ map2a][map2d ] .    in the last section",
    ", we pointed out that the correlation would depend on the amount of sachs - wolfe , doppler and integrated sachs - wolfe effects .",
    "the decomposition of the temperature anisotropies both in the simply connected topology and in the toroidal cases are shown in fig .",
    "[ figdec ] . note that we show only the relative amplitude of these effects and not their cross correlation .",
    "we now turn to the correlation between pairs of circles , as introduced in  @xcite .",
    "if the topology is not known in advance , the relative position between matching circles can be arbitrary , so that in general the search for circles is a six parameter problem : two parameters for the center of the first circle , two more for the center of the second circle , one for their common radius , and one for their relative phase ( i.e. the twist with which they are identified ) . in the case of a torus ,",
    "the circles sit directly opposite each other on the sky ( eliminating two parameters ) and there is no twist ( eliminating another parameter ) , so the problem reduces to a three parameters search .",
    "each choice of @xmath318 uniquely determines a circle of intersection ( assuming @xmath319 ) , and conversely each pair of circles arises from exactly two points @xmath318 and @xmath320 and no others . thus the point @xmath318 serves to parameterize the circle search . ] .",
    "we are not going to perform such a study , but rather focus on some features of matching circles in a toroidal universe .",
    "a simple estimator for the correlation between pairs of circles that are horizontal with respect to the coordinate system is obviously @xmath321 where we have set @xmath322 .",
    "if the temperature fluctuations on a pair of circles are completely uncorrelated , then on average @xmath323 .",
    "if they are completely correlated , then @xmath324 , and if they are anti correlated , then @xmath325 .",
    "each @xmath1 can be seen either as the theoretical expectation for a given model , or an observed quantity that can be measured from the cmb sky . in the first case , it represents a feature that one can expect from a given model , and in the second case it represents an estimator of some features predicted by the topology .",
    "here , we shall concentrate on the _ observed _ @xmath326 that we compute from simulated maps , first to check the validity of our procedure to compute the correlation matrix @xmath287 , and second to convince us that it is possible to see the presence of matching circles using simple techniques ( although we do not pretend that this method is optimal ) .    in principle , two matching circles have the same angular diameter , so that only the case @xmath327 is relevant , but we have chosen to leave @xmath328 as a free parameter to see to what extent uncorrelated circles might happen to seem correlated by chance .",
    "we first show in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] a few examples of the observed function @xmath326 for a simply connected universe .",
    "as expected , the correlation is quite large when @xmath329 because the circles are near each other and the real space correlation function @xmath330 ( the legendre transform of the @xmath4 ) is not 0 when @xmath331 . with our normalization of @xmath332 , one has @xmath333 which will of course remain valid when the topology is multi - connected .",
    "when the separation between @xmath334 and @xmath328 is large , one can neglect the correlation between the two circles , and the main contribution to @xmath335 comes from statistical fluctuations : it is always possible that two circles exhibit similar temperature patterns by chance .",
    "the variance of these statistical fluctuations is probably given by the number of independent pixels on the map and therefore by a combination of the scale at which the power spectrum is large and of the resolution of the map ( here , @xmath336 ) . in any case , the amplitude of the largest statistical fluctuations of @xmath337 gives an idea of the amplitude of the signal needed to detect a multiconnected topology . for the maps we have generated , the correlation reaches @xmath338 for a few pairs of falsely matched circles .",
    "[ fig5 ] , [ fig7 ] , [ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] show contour plots for several realizations of the correlation matrix in a torus universe .",
    "the torus aligns naturally with the coordinate system , so one expects correlated pairs of circles at @xmath339 for each positive integer @xmath176 such that the arcsine exists .",
    "for our choice of cosmological parameters we have @xmath340 and @xmath341 ( in units of the hubble radius ) , giving @xmath342 for these values of @xmath334 and @xmath328 , one expects a perfect correlation for the sachs - wolfe contribution : @xmath343 this formula holds both when one considers @xmath344 as an ensemble average and when one considers a given realization of the density field since in both cases it follows from the fact that one sees the same region from different directions .",
    "these correlations appear clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] which considers only the sachs - wolfe contribution . in this case one",
    "would have even expected perfect correlations for the values of @xmath334 and @xmath328 given in ( [ valtheta12 ] ) .",
    "this is not what we have , but the reason for this is easy to understand : imposing @xmath345 in real space induces in legendre space correlations at arbitrary large multipoles @xmath2 . here , for computational reasons , we were forced to truncate the correlation matrix at a rather low value of @xmath2 , so the matching is significant but not perfect .",
    "it would presumably increase in higher resolution maps .",
    "if one considers the doppler contribution to the cmb anisotropies , the situation is somewhat different .",
    "as announced above , the correlation between two circles depends on their relative angle .",
    "more precisely , it is given by @xmath346 where @xmath347 and @xmath348 are two constant unit vectors spanning an angle @xmath349 , and where the brackets denote an average over all the directions of the unit vector @xmath136 .",
    "after some manipulations , one obtains @xmath350 again , for the same reason as for the sachs - wolfe contribution , this formula holds both if one considers @xmath351 as an ensemble average or if we consider a given realization of the density field .",
    "one recovers as expected that the correlation is @xmath16 , @xmath51 , @xmath352 for @xmath353 , @xmath354 , @xmath355 , respectively . for the values of the angle given in eq .",
    "( [ valtheta12 ] ) , one obtains @xmath356 , @xmath357 , @xmath358 , respectively .",
    "these are the results that we obtain qualitatively in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , where no correlation at all is seen for the circles at @xmath359 , and positive ( resp.negative ) correlation is seen for the circles at @xmath360 ( resp .",
    "@xmath361 ) .    finally , the correlations due to the integrated sachs - wolfe effect are shown in fig .",
    "as expected , no particular correlation is seen for the values of @xmath334 and @xmath328 of eq .",
    "( [ valtheta12 ] ) .",
    "the contour plots are however quite different from those of the sachs - wolfe and doppler contributions .",
    "the reason is twofold .",
    "first , most of the power lies at the smallest multipoles .",
    "this translates into the fact that the contours are broad in the sense that they do not vary a lot on small intervals of @xmath334 and @xmath328 .",
    "second , the fact that most of the power is at large scales implies that a very small number of modes contributes to it ( since we see a finite region of the universe ) , so there is a large cosmic variance that makes the statistical uncertainty very large ( thus serendipitously similar temperature patterns on two unrelated circles are easily achieved here ) .",
    "combining all the contributions to the cmb anisotropies allows one to simulate realizations of the exact @xmath326 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] . since the sachs - wolfe contribution is dominant , the spikes are still clearly visible at their expected positions , but appear less prominent than in fig .",
    "as expected , it seems that the circles at @xmath362 are slightly less correlated than the other two pairs because their doppler contribution is not correlated , but this deserves a more careful analysis .      among the spherical spaces , the procedure presented above",
    "can be applied most easily to lens and prism spaces , because their eigenmodes are known explicitly .",
    "the eigenmodes are known analytically in toroidal coordinates ( see section  [ subsec_spherical ] ) , and appendix  [ app_b ] shows how to convert them to spherical coordinates . in this section ,",
    "we present some sample maps exhibiting the matching circles to demonstrate that the whole computational chain ( computation of the modes and implementation in a cmb code ) is working .",
    "a complete and detailed study , along the same lines as the study done for the cubic torus in the previous section , will be presented in a follow - up article .    as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , because our universe is almost flat , observational methods such as the circles method will typically detect only a cyclic subgroup of the holonomy group , so the universe `` looks like a lens space '' no matter what its true topology is .",
    "it follows that lens spaces are particularly interesting to capture the observational properties of multi - connected spherical spaces .",
    "in particular , we showed  @xcite that a cyclic factor @xmath228 creates matching circles in the cmb only when @xmath363 and that the second factor , if it exists , is in general undetectable .",
    "let us emphasize some differences with the torus case .",
    "first , concerning the eigenmodes , let us take the example of a lens space @xmath364 of order @xmath200 . for @xmath365 it reduces to @xmath24 and for @xmath366 it reduces to projective space ; more generally the index plays a role analogous to the size , @xmath18 , of the torus in euclidean space .",
    "the first non - zero eigenvalue is always @xmath367 and has a multiplicity @xmath23 for @xmath368 and @xmath369 otherwise .",
    "this constancy of the first eigenvalue contrasts sharply with the case of a cubic torus , for which the smallest eigenvalue scales as @xmath370 .",
    "it can be understood by realizing that when @xmath200 increases the space is becoming smaller only in one direction and remains large in perpendicular directions .",
    "the lens spaces @xmath364 are globally homogeneous ( like the torus ) so that the coefficients @xmath48\\,{s}}_{{k}\\,{\\ell}\\,{m}}}$ ] do not depend on the observer s position ( i.e. , they are the same no matter where in the space you choose the basepoint ) . thus neither the correlation matrix @xmath287 nor the positions of the matching circles depend on the basepoint .",
    "unfortunately , this is not the case for a general lens space @xmath371 . for a general lens space , the coefficients @xmath48\\,{s}}_{{k}\\,{\\ell}\\,{m}}}$ ] , the correlation matrix @xmath287 and the positions of the matching circles all depend on the observer s position .",
    "for instance , the `` canonical '' choice of coordinates used in sec .",
    "[ subsubsec_lens ] for the toroidal coordinate system puts the preferred symmetry axes in the @xmath372 and @xmath373 directions ( i.e. , the axis are the intersection of @xmath24 with the @xmath374-plane and the @xmath375-plane , respectively , in four - dimensional euclidean space ) . from a cosmological point of view , this is a poor choice , because the observer s translated images are `` atypically close '' .",
    "for example in @xmath376 , which has cyclic factors @xmath377 and @xmath378 , a generic observer will see three lines of four images each , but a nongeneric observer sitting on a symmetry axis will see a single line of @xmath283 images .    for a globally homogeneous space @xmath364 , the closest topological image is located at a distance @xmath379 , so the topology is detectable just so @xmath200 is nt too small . more precisely , the topology is potentially detectable if and only if @xmath380 .",
    "for example , this implies that the topology is detectable for all @xmath381 if @xmath382 .",
    "circles match differently in a homogeneous lens space than in a tours . in a torus",
    "the circles match straight across because the holonomies are all pure translations . in a homogeneous lens space , by contrast , the holonomies are clifford translations , and so the matching circles are still diametrically opposite but match with a twist that s a multiple of @xmath383 , because clifford translations twist and translate of the same amount .",
