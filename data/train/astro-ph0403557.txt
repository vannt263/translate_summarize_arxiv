    "anomalies in the relative intensities of cno lines in ob spectra have been described for some time ( walborn 1976 , 1988 , 2003 ; and references therein ) .",
    "anticorrelations of n vs.  c , o and correlations with he / h in the expected sense have encouraged interpretations in terms of mixing of cno - cycled material into the atmospheres and winds of massive stars .",
    "an important point has been the recognition that the morphologically normal majority of ob supergiants actually have some degree of n and he enhancements already , while the obc minority have normal ( i.e. , main - sequence ) abundances and the obn group have more extreme mixing ( maeder & conti 1994 ; smith & howarth 1994 ) .",
    "the recent development of models for massive stellar evolution with rotation ( maeder & meynet 2000 ) is an advance toward realism since massive stars often rotate rapidly , but another dimension is added to the phase space that must be explored in order to compare observations with theory .",
    "fortunately , a new observational diagnostic is added concurrently , namely the cno abundances , since the degree of mixing also depends on the initial rotation .",

    "the far - violet observations of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) stars were carried out with the cassegrain spectrograph at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) 1.5  m telescope during 2002 february  2227 .",

    "( in preparation ) . surprisingly , however , the four lmc o2  iii(f * ) spectra in the sample separate into two groups , with o  iv substantially stronger than n  iv in one pair and the opposite in the other , while the smc object is similar to the latter lmc pair , as shown in figure  1",
    ". this unexpected result prompted us to re - examine in a new light the blue - violet spectra of the same five stars shown by walborn et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) and reproduced in figure  2 .",
    "it was immediately clear that the systematic differences between hde  269810 and sk  @xmath468@xmath10  137 on the one hand , and lh64@xmath416 , lh10@xmath43061 , and ngc  346 - 3 on the other , can be described consistently in terms of different relative line strengths of n vs.  c. in particular , the first pair have weaker n  iii and n  iv emission lines as well as n  v absorption lines , along with the presence of c  iv @xmath11 , while all of the n  lines are stronger in the latter group ( except for the n  v in ngc  346@xmath43 ) .",
    "moreover , the he / h line ratios are seen to be larger in the latter group as well ( although unclear in the smc object due to nebular hydrogen emission and the lower resolution in the far violet ) .",
    "presumably the o  iv @xmath12 , which is also prominent in the first pair , is blended with n  iii @xmath13 in the other stars .",
    "the morphology strongly excludes ionization effects as an explanation and equally strongly suggests n/(c , o ) and he / h abundance differences as the cause .",

    "hence , the first three spectra are hereby reclassified as on2  iii(f * ) . this class has been interpreted in terms of mixing of cno - cycled material into the atmospheres and winds of the stars ( e.g. , maeder & conti 1994 ) .",
    "the presence of these effects at the earliest spectral types is a new development that may further challenge the models , however , as discussed below .",
    "walborn et al .",
    "( 2000 ) had already classified ngc  346 - 3 as on3  iii(f * ) , purely on the basis of the very large n  v / c  iv wind - profile ratio in its uv spectrum .",
    "the on designation was not retained when this star was moved into the o2 class by walborn et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) , partly because of concerns about a pure uv classification criterion and about the possibility that all such spectra might have similarly large n / c , but obvious only in the smc object because the lower systemic metallicity allowed the very sensitive c  iv feature to desaturate .",
    "however , lh64@xmath416 demonstrates that the latter concern is not valid , since the c  iv can be weaker than n  v at lmc metallicity .",
    "thus , the proper classification of ngc  346@xmath43 is also on2  iii(f * ) , as confirmed here by the 3400    observations .",
    "haser et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) derived a very large n / c abundance ratio in ngc  346 - 3 , but normal in sk  @xmath468@xmath10  137 , while puls et  al .",

    "example fits to the spectra of two stars are shown in figure  4 .",
    "recent developments in model - atmosphere studies of hot stars routinely permit sophisticated metal - line blanketing in non - lte to be considered , under either plane - parallel geometry ( e.g. , tlusty : lanz & hubeny 2003 ) or spherical geometry ( e.g. , cmfgen : hillier & miller 1998 ) .",

    "the temperature structure is determined by radiative equilibrium .",
    "cmfgen does not solve the momentum equation , so that a density or velocity structure is required .",
    "for the supersonic part , the velocity is parameterized with a classical @xmath16-type law ( with @xmath17 ) , which is connected to a hydrostatic density structure at depth , such that the velocity and velocity gradient match at the interface .",
    "the subsonic velocity structure is set by the corresponding fully line - blanketed tlusty ( v.200 ) model with @xmath18 ( cgs ) .",
    "we have assumed a depth - independent doppler profile for all lines when solving for the atmospheric structure in the co - moving frame , while in the final calculation of the emergent spectrum in the observer s frame , we have adopted a radially - dependent turbulence , which reflects the effect of shocks due to wind instabilities .",

    "in order to estimate the uncertainties of our abundance results , we have undertaken additional modeling of two kinds .",
    "first , the fits to the data discussed above have been re - examined , to determine the range of parameters , if any , that might yield comparable or perhaps even improved fits . for example , in the models upon which the results of table  1 are based , the n  iv @xmath32 emission line was well matched while the n  v absorption lines were somewhat underpredicted .",
    "it was found that increasing the @xmath33 of the two on2 stars , lh64@xmath416 and lh10@xmath43061 , to 56  kk improves the fits to the n  v lines but somewhat overpredicts the n  iv emission , as shown in figure  4 .",
    "simultaneously , the fits to the very weak c  iv @xmath11 emission line , the sole diagnostic of the carbon abundances in these data , were re - examined , with the result that c / c@xmath30 in the on2 stars could be reduced to as low as 0.02 .",
    "the only other possible changes indicated by this further modeling are small increases in o / o@xmath30 for the two lmc o2 stars , hde  269810 and sk  @xmath468@xmath10  137 , to 0.6 and 0.7 , respectively .",
    "in particular , no changes to the derived n  abundances are indicated . to summarize , as best",
    "we can determine from the intermediate - dispersion data alone , the uncertainties in @xmath33 are @xmath34  kk , in the carbon abundances a factor of 2.5 , and in the oxygen abundances a factor of 1.5 .",
    "one could infer that the uncertainty in the nitrogen abundances is less than a factor of 1.5 .    a second",
    ", more powerful comparison is provided by the available vlt / uves high - resolution spectrogram of hde  269810 , with wavelength coverage extending into the yellow - red . not only are the multiple , weak o  iv lines well resolved and defined in these data , additionally including @xmath223560@xmath463 and 4632 , but the strong c  iv @xmath35 , 5812 emission lines are available to better constrain the carbon abundance , and n  iv @xmath36 is also available .",
    "the good fit obtained with the same models used to analyze the intermediate - dispersion data is shown in figure  5 .",
    "the only significant discrepancies are in the o  iv @xmath223404@xmath412@xmath414 triplet , which is predicted in emission by models this hot but observed in absorption , and in higher members of the he  ii pickering series , which remain overpredicted .",
    "the improved fit to hydrogen and other helium lines is noteworthy ; the discrepancies at the lower dispersions are believed to be caused primarily by line - broadening and resolution matching between the models and data .",
    "it is reassuring that the mass - loss rate based also on the h@xmath9 profile here agrees well with that determined previously from he  ii @xmath37 alone .",
    "the stellar parameters that differ in the high - resolution analysis are @xmath33 , 55  kk ; @xmath38 , 6.38 ; @xmath39 yr@xmath1 ) , @xmath45.5 ; and he / h , 0.07 ; comparison with the respective values in table  1 indicates the reliability of that analysis .",
    "the derived c , n , o abundances relative to solar are 0.05 , 0.6 , and 0.8 , respectively ; i.e. , the c abundance is smaller by a factor of 4 , while the n , o abundances are larger by respective factors of 1.5 and 2 .",
    "it follows from these results that hde  269810 already has a an appreciable n / c enhancement over the lmc ism , by a factor of 23 .",
    "the uncertainties in the solar cno abundances given by grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ) are @xmath40  dex , or a factor of 1.15 .",
    "the corresponding magellanic cloud ism abundance uncertainties from russell & dopita ( 1992 ) are 0.130.18  dex for c , 0.150.20  dex for n , and 0.06 - 0.10  dex for o , or average factors of 1.4 , 1.5 , and 1.2 , respectively .",
    "thus , the uncertainties in the ratios are dominated by the stellar abundances , which we have estimated above to be factors of 2.54 for c , and 1.52 for n and o. the worst case is the n / c ratio , which in principle could be uncertain by a factor of  6 .",
    "however , such a factor can not apply randomly to the results , since it could invert the differential spectral morphology , which is not reasonable ; on the other hand , a systematic effect of that magnitude can not be ruled out with the present data .",
    "it is interesting that all of the c  redeterminations are lower , while the n and o are somewhat higher .",
    "thus , the n / c ratios may be even larger than given in table  1 .",
    "clearly it is highly desirable to reanalyze all of these stars with high - resolution data , at the same time determining their mass - loss rates from h@xmath9 and uv data , to refine the quantitative results .",
    "curiously , the luminosities , and hence the masses , estimated by walborn et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) for the o2  iii(f * ) stars hde  269810 ( 150  @xmath41 , average of two methods ) and sk  @xmath468@xmath10  137 ( 100  @xmath41 ) are considerably higher than those for the on2  iii(f * ) stars lh64@xmath416 ( 62  @xmath41 ) , lh10@xmath43061 ( 81  @xmath41 ) , and ngc  346@xmath43 ( 82  @xmath41 ) .",
    "the opposite relationship might have been expected , since both mass - loss rates and mixing increase with mass ( meynet & maeder 2000 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "perhaps the longer evolutionary timescales at the lower masses favor the observability of mixing effects .    until recently ,",
    "these abundance results would have been interpreted simply in terms of more advanced evolutionary ages for the on2 than the o2 objects , which remains a possibility .",
    "( of course , mass transfer in a binary system is an alternative mechanism likely responsible for at least some members of the on class  see bolton & rogers 1978 ; levato et  al .  1988 ; walborn & howarth 2000 ; lennon 2003 ) . in the context of evolutionary models with rotation for massive stars",
    "( maeder & meynet 2000 ; meynet & maeder 2000 ) , however , the degree of mixing of processed material to the surface at a given evolutionary age is a function of the initial rotational velocity .",
    "indeed , cno abundances in massive stars now become critical diagnostics of their initial parameters and evolutionary histories . for a given metallicity , the observed @xmath33 , @xmath42 , and cno abundances in principle enable derivation of the corresponding initial mass , current age , and initial rotational velocity .",
    "complete grids of evolutionary tracks for the most massive stars , at magellanic cloud metallicities and with a range of rotational velocities , are currently under development in geneva .",
    "meanwhile , we display illustrative comparisons in figures  68 , courtesy of g.  meynet and a.  maeder .",
    "figure  6 is a theoretical hr diagram in which the locations of the stars discussed here are compared with geneva evolutionary tracks for initial masses of 60 and 120  @xmath41 , at both lmc and smc metallicities ( mass fractions z  =  0.008 and 0.004 , respectively ) , and with an initial equatorial rotational velocity of 300  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "all of the stars lie near the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) , which is consistent with an early evolutionary stage for the two objects with normal spectra ; the present spectroscopic analysis again indicates higher masses for them than for the on2 objects .",
    "however , such a location is surprising for the latter , highly mixed stars .",
    "their initial masses still place them above the humphreys - davidson limit , so they can not be interpreted as post - red supergiants evolving blueward .",
    "a more relevant possibility may be that of `` homogeneous '' evolution , along tracks that rise and curve blueward from the zams in the hrd , which is predicted in the cases of strong mixing and/or very high initial rotational velocities ( langer & el  eid 1986 ; maeder 1987 ; langer 1992 ; meynet & maeder 2000 ) .",

    "the n / c ratios in the on2  iii(f * ) stars are the largest reported to date for near - main - sequence objects and are substantially larger than the standard model predictions , suggesting even more rapid mixing and perhaps providing additional support for homogeneous evolution .",
    "in contrast , the n / o ratios are compatible with the standard model predictions and indicate early operation of the on cycle , as expected in only the most massive stars .    on the other hand , the even larger n enhancements derived for later - type o supergiants in the magellanic clouds by crowther et  al .",
