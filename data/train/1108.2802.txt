    "this paper is , in a sense , a sequel to the paper @xcite , where we studied higher genus curves in a toric variety . in this paper",
    ", we develop a technique which enable us to use ideas from tropical geometry to study curves in a variety which is not necessarily toric .",
    "thus , combining with @xcite , we can theoretically study higher genus curves in such a variety by combinatorial way .    in @xcite",
    ", we already used the theory of tropical curves to study curves in varieties which degenerate to irreducible toric varieties .",
    "examples included flag varieties and some moduli space of bundles on a riemann surface .",
    "but in this paper , it suffices that the variety has a degeneration to a union of varieties .",
    "the class of such varieties is very broad , but we mainly concentrate on the case when the variety has a degeneration to a union of toric varieties ( toric degeneration in the language of @xcite ) , where the theory becomes particularly efficient .",
    "our principal examples are k3 and calabi - yau hypersurfaces . in the next section ,",
    "we study the k3 case , where the essential calculation of this paper is done .",
    "the core of our calculation consists of two points :    * calculate the normal sheaf . *",
    "geometrically understand the tangent and obstruction classes .",
    "the first point is a rather simple calculation , and the result is easily applicable to very broad situations .",
    "the second point is a more complicated but interesting calculation .",
    "a remarkable point is that the calculation simplifies in ( some of ) higher dimensional situations .",
    "namely , in section [ sec : cyline ] , we study lines in a quintic calabi - yau hypersurface .",
    "there we borrow an idea sheldon katz @xcite , which we learned from mark gross , giving a way to combinatorially count 2875 lines in it .",
    "we reprove katz s counting using our method . in section [ sec : disks ] , we give another example of our calculation , applied to holomorphic disks .",
    "other applications will be given in subsequent papers ( see @xcite ) .",
    "+ * acknowledgment . *",
    "the starting point of this paper was the combinatorial idea of counting lines in a quintic calabi - yau 3-fold .",
    "bernd siebert kindly showed me an email from mark gross , in which gross explained this idea . on the other hand , gross told me that it was an idea going back to sheldon katz @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank all of them , without any of these coincidences this paper might not have been written .",
    "we would also like to thank ionut ciocan - fontanine for pointing out to us the possible relationship of our calculation to clemens conjecture .",

    "consider a degeneration of a quartic k3 surface given by the equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 are homogeneous coordinates of @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the parameter of the degeneration and @xmath4 is a generic homogeneous quartic polynomial of @xmath1 .",

    "these singular points have the same local structure :    [ lem : coord ] for each of these singular points , there is an analytic neighborhood isomorphic to a neighborhood of the origin of the set @xmath17    in fact , in affine coordinates , the equation defining the degeneration becomes @xmath18 we assume that the line @xmath12 is defined by @xmath19 , and one of the singular point on it is given by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 .",
    "let us write @xmath22 .",
    "then @xmath4 can be written in the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 are polynomials and @xmath25 has non - zero constant term . write @xmath26 .",
    "the equation becomes @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",

    "+ we consider the following situation .",
    "let @xmath33 be an embedding of a projective line , whose image is contained in an irreducible component of @xmath6 .",
    "the problem is the following : @xmath34 as is pointed out several times ( @xcite , see also @xcite in the context of tropical curves ) , for an immersed stable curve @xmath35 , if the image is away from the singularities of @xmath14 , it is necessary for @xmath36 to satisfy the _ pre - log _ condition ( definition 4.3 , @xcite ) to solve the above problem . in our situation ,",
    "the line is embedded in a component of @xmath6 , so we have the following necessary condition .",
    "[ lem : log ] let @xmath37 be as above .",
    "let @xmath38 be the component of @xmath6 to which the line is mapped . then , to solve the problem above , it is necessary to satisfy the condition : @xmath39 +    since the set @xmath40 is contained in @xmath41 , one sees that @xmath37 is torically transverse as a map to @xmath38 , in the sense of definition 4.1 of @xcite .",
    "[ rem : genericity ] for the condition @xmath42 to be satisfied , a condition must be imposed to @xmath4 , the defining polynomial of the quartic surface .",
    "namely , the set @xmath43 should contain three points which are collinear .",
    "this imposes one dimensional condition to @xmath4 , and corresponds to the fact that generic k3 surface does not contain an embedded @xmath44-curve . in the rest of this section ,",
    "we take generic @xmath4 among those which satisfy this condition . in particular",
    ", we still assume that the singular locus @xmath40 does not intersect the torus fixed point set of @xmath9 .",
    "the condition @xmath45 is necessary , but not sufficient .",
    "for example , consider the family defined by the equation @xmath46 using homogeneous coordinates .",
    "the set @xmath40 contains the points @xmath47 so the line @xmath48 satisfies the condition @xmath45 .",
    "however , by direct calculation , one sees that there is no first order lift of this line .",
    "the rest of this section is devoted to the study of the obstruction to the existence of lifts of lines satisfying @xmath45 .      as usual in deformation theory ,",
    "the possible obstructions are represented by some cohomology classes . however , whether these obstructions really matter or not can not be seen just by looking at the cohomology classes .",
    "this is a non - linear problem , and solved by calculating _",
    "kuranishi maps_. we calculate the cohomology classes in this subsection , and calculate kuranishi maps in the next subsection .",
    "first we study the local nature around the singular points .",
    "as noted above , the space @xmath14 has an neighborhood @xmath49 which is analytically isomorphic to the variety defined by the equation @xmath50 at each singular point .",
    "we consider an embedded line in @xmath51 which    * is torically transverse as a map to @xmath38 and * intersects the toric boundary at the singular points ,    as above .    from the proof of lemma",
    "[ lem : coord ] , we see that locally the line is given by the equations @xmath52 where @xmath53 are generic complex numbers . in particular , neither of @xmath53 is zero .",
    "@xmath54 is a convergent series around @xmath55 whose constant term is zero .",
    "we take an affine coordinate @xmath40 on @xmath56 so that @xmath57 here we write the composition @xmath58 by the letter @xmath37 , for brevity .",
    "now we study how the local lifts of @xmath37 are described using these coordinates .",
    "note that the variety @xmath50 has a natural structure of a toric variety over @xmath59 $ ] .",
    "so it has a standard log structure which is log smooth over @xmath60 $ ] ( @xmath60 $ ] is also equipped with the standard log structure as a toric variety ) . also , we put a log structure on @xmath56 associated to the divisor @xmath61 .",
    "the logarithmic tangent sheaf @xmath62 of @xmath49 is locally free and generated by the sections @xmath63 there is a following relation between the logarithmic cotangent vectors : @xmath64 which becomes @xmath65 when restricted to @xmath6 . since the map @xmath37 factors through @xmath6 , the natural map from @xmath66 to @xmath67 is locally given by @xmath68 around @xmath69 . here",
    "@xmath70 is a convergent series around @xmath71 whose constant term is zero .    since @xmath72 is log smooth , there is always a local lift of @xmath37 .",
    "the obstruction to the existence of a lift of @xmath37 is given by the first cohomology of the pull - back @xmath67 ( @xcite ) .",
    "if a lift exists , the space of such lifts is a torsor of the zeroth cohomology of the same sheaf . however",
    ", since the domain @xmath56 ( with three special points ) has no moduli , it suffices to replace @xmath67 by the logarithmic normal sheaf for the calculation of the obstruction .",
    "around @xmath69 , the logarithmic normal sheaf @xmath73 of @xmath74 is the quotient of @xmath67 by the subsheaf generated by the section @xmath75 above , so it is also locally free and generated by @xmath76 .",
    "since we consider a lift of @xmath37 over @xmath59 $ ] , the normal vector which gives a local lift must be evaluated to one by the covector @xmath77 .",
    "so the local lifts are given by the local sections @xmath78 of @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is a holomorphic function on a neighborhood of @xmath81 .",
    "let @xmath82 be the inclusion .",
    "around @xmath83 , we induce a log structure on @xmath38 from that of @xmath49 .",
    "there is a natural inclusion from @xmath84 ( which is spanned by @xmath85 and @xmath86 around @xmath83 ) to @xmath87 , and this again factors through @xmath6 .",
    "but we remark that the coordinates @xmath88 are not the standard coordinates of an affine part of @xmath9 , which we wrote by @xmath89 .",
    "using @xmath22 instead of @xmath90 as in the proof of lemma [ lem : coord ] , the relation between logarithmic tangent vectors of the two coordinate systems are given by @xmath91    the map from @xmath66 to @xmath67 factors through this . in the coordinate @xmath92 , the line is given by the equation @xmath93 as a subvariety of @xmath9 .",
    "the map from @xmath66 to @xmath94 is given by @xmath95 ( here again we abused the notation by representing the map @xmath96 by the same letter @xmath37 ) .    so around @xmath69 ,",
    "the subsheaf of @xmath79 generated by @xmath85 is naturally isomorphic to the quotient @xmath97 of @xmath98 by the subsheaf generated by @xmath99 : @xmath100    on the other hand , the usual ( non - logarithmic ) normal bundle of the line @xmath101 in @xmath102 is , locally around @xmath69 , given by the quotient @xmath103 there is a natural map from @xmath104 to @xmath105 ( note that since @xmath106 , @xmath107 ) .",
    "this is isomorphic except @xmath108 , and at @xmath108 , the quotient is the skyscraper sheaf @xmath109 .",
    "it is clear that away from the singularity , the logarithmic normal bundle @xmath104 is naturally isomorphic to the usual normal bundle .",
    "since there are three singular points which are locally analytically isomorphic , we have the exact sequence of sheaves @xmath110 here @xmath111 are the points on @xmath56 mapped to @xmath40 by @xmath37 .",
    "the usual normal bundle @xmath105 is isomorphic to @xmath112 , so the sheaf @xmath104 is isomorphic to @xmath113 .",
    "as seen from @xmath114 , this sheaf @xmath97 plays the role of the normal sheaf for @xmath74 ( over @xmath59 $ ] ) .",
    "the cohomology groups of @xmath97 are @xmath115 that is , there is an obstruction class for @xmath37 . for the calculation of the kuranishi map , we need to represent this class in an effective way .    by construction",
    ", @xmath97 is the sheaf of sections of the usual normal sheaf @xmath105 which have single zeroes at three points . by serre duality , @xmath116 by the above description",
    ", @xmath117 is the sheaf of sections of the usual conormal bundle @xmath118 , where single poles are allowed at three points .    from the point of view of tropical geometry",
    ", the line is presented by the 1-skeleton of the standard fan on @xmath119 defining @xmath102 up to translation .",
    "the directions of the three edges from the unique vertex are @xmath120 in particular , the sum of these vectors is zero , by the balancing condition ( see @xcite for the basic notions of tropical curves ) .",
    "these edges correspond to the intersection of the line with the toric divisors .",
    "so these edges also corresponds to the intersection of the line with the singular locus @xmath40 , where the sections of @xmath117 can have poles .",
    "then it is easy to see that the sections of @xmath117 is represented by the triplet of vectors in the dual space @xmath121 of @xmath122 , which annihilate the vectors in the directions of the three edges , respectively .",
    "that is , taking @xmath123 and @xmath124 as a basis of @xmath122 and writing by @xmath125 the dual basis of @xmath121 , we have @xmath126    the sections of the normal sheaf @xmath105 of the line is identified with the vectors of @xmath122 .",
    "so they make natural parings with the vectors @xmath125 and @xmath127 .",
    "the paring between a section of @xmath128 and a section of @xmath105 gives a rational section of the canonical bundle @xmath129 , and its residues at the poles is given by the value of the paring between an element of @xmath130 and the vector of @xmath131 corresponding to the section of @xmath105 .    by residue theorem",
    ", the sum of the residues must be zero . in terms of the vectors",
    ", this means that the sections of @xmath128 is represented by the subspace of @xmath130 as follows : @xmath132 summarizing , we have the following .    [ thm : k3 ]",
    "let @xmath133 be a line satisfying the condition ( @xmath134 ) of lemma [ lem : log ] .",
    "the cohomology group representing the obstruction to the existence of a lift of @xmath37 is isomorphic to @xmath135 , and its dual space is naturally presented by the triplet of vectors @xmath136 in @xmath121 satisfying the condition @xmath137      the next task is to see whether this class really obstructs the existence of a lift of @xmath37 or not .",
    "we begin with studying the local model around the singularity .",
    "namely , consider @xmath138 and a curve @xmath139 given by a parametrization : @xmath140 here @xmath141 is an analytic function and @xmath142 is a coordinate on the curve @xmath139 .",
    "note that this curve intersects the singular point @xmath143    we study a general form of lifts of @xmath139 ( over @xmath144 $ ] ) .",
    "they should have the form @xmath145",
    "@xmath146 @xmath147 where @xmath148 are analytic functions .",
    "taking @xmath149 as a new coordinate on @xmath139 , the above parametrization for @xmath150 becomes @xmath151 @xmath152 @xmath153 where @xmath154 are analytic functions .",
    "by @xmath155 , @xmath156 thus , using appropriate coordinate on @xmath139 , we have the expression of a general lift as @xmath151 @xmath157 @xmath158 in particular , for any order of @xmath159 , the lift intersects @xmath71 at the parameter @xmath160 .",
    "this can also be seen from the discussion in the previous subsection , since the section of the normal sheaf must have a single zero at each singular point , compared to the usual normal sheaf of a line in @xmath102 .",
    "now we return to the realistic situation , where we consider a degeneration of k3 surfaces .",
    "recall that in the proof of lemma [ lem : coord ] , we introduced a change of coordinates @xmath161 to locally bring the equation into the model case @xmath50 .    in terms of the coordinates @xmath162",
    ", the line in @xmath6 is represented as @xmath163 where @xmath164 is a nonzero complex number .",
    "lifts of this must have the form ( after appropriate affine change of the coordinates on the domain curve ) @xmath165",
    "@xmath166 @xmath167    the relation between the parameters @xmath142 and @xmath40 of the line ( near a singular point ) is given by @xmath168 substituting this to @xmath169 , we have @xmath170 note that @xmath171 and @xmath172 contains the variable @xmath159 because these are functions of @xmath173 , and @xmath174 and @xmath175 have the above form .    comparing the coefficients of @xmath176 , @xmath177 , we see @xmath178",
    "so we have @xmath179 this determines @xmath180 .",
    "now let us compare the coefficients of @xmath159 .",
    "we have @xmath181 since we know @xmath180 , we can calculate @xmath182 from this ( recall @xmath183 ) .",
    "note that although the choices of @xmath184 and @xmath185 are not unique , but one sees that @xmath182 does not depend on this choice .",
    "observe that in the model case @xmath50 , all lifts of a curve have the form @xmath186 that is , @xmath187 for all @xmath15 .",
    "in particular , the nonzero @xmath188 is caused by global reason , and they are the obstruction to the lift .",
    "the kuranishi map is calculated as follows .",
    "recall that the dual of the obstruction class was described by conormal sheaf valued 1-forms where a logarithmic pole is allowed at each singular point , satisfying some condition . in turn , these sections are described by a tripled of vectors in @xmath121 , the dual space of @xmath122 where the fan defining @xmath9 lies .",
    "the term @xmath182 corresponds to a normal vector @xmath189 at the singular point ( recall @xmath190 is the value of @xmath90 at the singular point ) , and this gives a vector in @xmath122 ( more precisely , a vector in the quotient space of it by the subspace which the kernel of a vector in @xmath121 describing the dual obstruction ) . at each of the three singular points ,",
    "we have similarly such a vector , and making pairings between these vectors and the above three vectors in @xmath121 and taking the sum , we get a scalar .",
    "this is just the kuranishi map .",
    "since the zeroth cohomology of the normal sheaf @xmath97 is zero and the first cohomology is one dimensional , the kuranishi map can be represented as a map from a point to @xmath135 , that is , it is given by a scalar .",
    "this is the first order kuranishi map . when this is zero",
    ", then we can solve the equations for @xmath191 and @xmath192 and determine the first order lift .",
    "then doing the same procedure for @xmath193 , we can define the second order kuranishi map , and when this is zero , we can find the second order lift , and so on .      as an example of our calculation , we consider a degeneration given by an equation of the following form : @xmath194 here @xmath195 are unfixed scalars .",
    "this equation is chosen in the following way : consider a simpler equation @xmath196 this is the equation we gave after remark [ rem : genericity ] the singular locus of this degeneration contains three points @xmath197 which lie on the line @xmath198 however , it is easy to see ( by calculating th kuranishi map , or by calculating directly ) that this line does not have the first order lift .",
    "so we add terms @xmath199 , and study when the above line has the first order lift .",
    "first of all , the singular locus of the total space @xmath14 must contain the above three points .",
    "this implies the condition @xmath200 so the equation becomes @xmath201 now we assume @xmath202 and inhomogenize the equation : @xmath203 consider the singular point @xmath204 .",
    "the parametrization is @xmath205 the functions @xmath24 are given as follows : @xmath206 @xmath207 @xmath208 then @xmath209 since @xmath210 we have @xmath211 similarly , at @xmath212 , one calculates @xmath213 at the remaining singularity which lies at @xmath214 , one sees @xmath215 .",
    "thus , the kuranishi map is given by @xmath216 the condition for the vanishing of the kuranishi map is @xmath217    on the other hand , we can directly calculate the liftability condition by substituting @xmath165 @xmath166 @xmath167 into the equation . then from the coefficients of @xmath218",
    ", we have @xmath219 using this , we see from the coefficients of @xmath220 , @xmath221 solving this , we again have @xmath217 in general , one easily sees that the kuranishi map drastically reduces the amount of calculation .",
    "each component of @xmath6 is @xmath102 with four distinguished points ( singular locus of @xmath14 ) on each component of the toric divisors .",
    "we considered a line through three of these points , then there is a unique cubic curve through the remaining nine points .",
    "if the line is liftable , then the intersection of the hyperplane containing the lifted line with the k3 surface contains another cubic curve , so the above calculation of the kuranishi map also calculates the kuranishi map for the cubic curve .      as an easy application of the calculation of the proof of theorem [ thm : k3 ]",
    ", we consider the case of a cubic surface .",
    "we consider a degeneration similar to the k3 case : @xmath222 where @xmath223 are three of the standard homogeneous coordinates of @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the parameter for the degeneration , and @xmath4 is a generic homogeneous cubic polynomial .",
    "let @xmath224 be the total space of the degeneration , and @xmath225 be the central fiber as before . in this case",
    ", @xmath6 is a union of three projective planes glued along three projective lines : @xmath226 @xmath227 on each of these lines , there are three singular points of @xmath14 .",
    "see the figure below .",
    "note that the bottom is open .",
    "each singular point has the same local structure as in the k3 case .",
    "we consider the problem of which line in @xmath6 lifts to a general fiber of @xmath14 .",
    "so let @xmath228 be a line .",
    "as in the k3 case , if @xmath37 is liftable , then it is necessary that the intersection with @xmath12 must be at the singular points .",
    "however , in this case , there is no restriction to the intersection with the bottom lines ( @xmath229 in the figure ) .    the relevant normal bundle @xmath104 is @xmath230 by the calculation in the previous proof .",
    "in this case , the cohomology groups are @xmath231 in particular , the line is unobstructed .",
    "thus , any line which intersects @xmath12 at singular points lifts , and on each @xmath9 , there are @xmath232 such lines .",
    "so there are @xmath233 liftable lines in total , which proves the well - known result for the cubic surface .",
    "here we review an idea to combinatorially count @xmath234-curves in quintic calabi - yau hypersurfaces via degeneration , due to sheldon katz @xcite .    consider a degeneration of a generic quintic calabi - yau hypersurface defined by the equation @xmath235 where @xmath236 are homogeneous coordinates of @xmath237",
    ", @xmath3 is the parameter of degeneration and @xmath4 is a generic homogeneous quintic polynomial of @xmath236 .",
    "let @xmath14 be the total space and @xmath238 be the central fiber .",
    "each @xmath239 has a natural structure of a toric variety .",
    "let us consider @xmath240 . in this case",
    ", the intersection of @xmath240 with the singular locus @xmath40 of @xmath14 is given by the union of four quintic curves , one for each toric divisor : @xmath241 moreover , for @xmath242 , @xmath243 is the set of five points .",
    "since @xmath4 is generic , we can assume that @xmath244 does not intersect the torus fixed points of @xmath56 .",
    "we consider the lifting problem ( @xmath245 ) for lines in @xmath240 . as in the k3 case , a liftable line should intersect the toric divisor of @xmath240 only at @xmath246 . since a line intersects each toric divisor",
    "only once and @xmath244s lie on the toric boundary , this condition is the same as the condition that the line intersects each @xmath244 .",
    "since the degree of @xmath247 is two , there are at least @xmath248 lines satisfying this condition , for generic @xmath4 .    even if @xmath4 is generic , the configuration of the four quintic curves in @xmath249 ( that is , @xmath250 ) is not generic in the space of the configurations of such curves .",
    "so the number of lines might not be @xmath251 , but there are at least @xmath251 lines , when counted with multiplicity .",
    "these lines can be classified into two classes .",
    "let @xmath252 be the toric subvariety of codimension two in @xmath240 .    1",
    ".   the line does not intersect @xmath253 for any @xmath254 .",
    "the line intersects some @xmath253 .",
    "now we count the number of lines in class ( 2 ) .",
    "the lines in class ( 2 ) can be further divided into two classes :    1 .",
    "the line intersects two different @xmath253s .",
    "the line intersects only one @xmath253 .",
    "let @xmath255 be a point in @xmath256 .",
    "then the number of lines containing @xmath255 in the above @xmath251 lines is 25 , which is the number of intersection points of the quintic curves @xmath257 , projected to @xmath102 from @xmath255 .",
    "there are 30 points like @xmath255 , so this counts @xmath258 lines of class ( 2 ) .",
    "however , this doubly counts the lines of class ( 2)-i .",
    "it is easy to see that the lines in class ( 2)-i is @xmath259 where 3 is the number of pairs of @xmath253 which does not intersect .",
    "thus , there are @xmath260 lines of class ( 2 ) .",
    "we see that the number of the lines of class ( 1 ) is at least , @xmath261 this is the number we want , since @xmath262 is the number of curves in a generic quintic calabi - yau hypersurface .",
    "we prove the following , which justifies katz s count .",
    "originally katz justified it based on different method @xcite .",
    "[ thm : cy3 ] for generic @xmath4 , there are exactly 2875 distinct lines of type ( 1 ) and each of them lifts in a unique way .",

    "this is immediate when the incidence conditions ( four quintic curves ) are generic and the corresponding schubert calculus gives the expected answer .",
    "however , our incidence conditions are in very special position , we prove the finiteness by low - tech argument .",
    "first , we note that the moduli of plane quintic curve is 20 dimensional , so even after fixing 15 points ( the position of the intersections with the toric divisors of @xmath102 ) , we still have freedom to perturb .",
    "it is clear that for general @xmath4 , the number of lines of class ( 2 ) is finite .",
    "a line of class ( 1 ) can be described as follows .",
    "recall we write the intersection of @xmath240 and the singular locus @xmath40 of @xmath14 by @xmath263 fix a point @xmath255 in @xmath264 consider the projection @xmath265 from @xmath255 .",
    "the image of @xmath266 gives three quintic curves in @xmath102 .",
    "a line through @xmath255 satisfying the incidence conditions corresponds to the points in the intersection @xmath267 so clearly the number of lines satisfying the incidence conditions is finite .",
    "moreover , after suitable perturbation , we can assume that for any @xmath268 , the triple intersections of the image of quintics by @xmath269 are all transversal in the sense that any two branches out of three intersects transversally .    in this case , the four hypersurfaces in @xmath270 , the moduli space of lines in @xmath240 , given by the incidence conditions intersects transversally , and gives expected @xmath251 intersections .",
    "so the number of lines of class ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in @xmath240 are also as expected , namely , 575 and 675 .      in this section",

    "let us assume that the curve intersects the line @xmath271 ( see subsection [ subsec : combi ] for the notations ) .    as before ,",
    "we consider the local model of the degeneration . in this case , locally around the intersection of the curve and @xmath271 ( which should be a singular point in the total space of the degeneration ) , the total space @xmath14 can be written by the equation @xmath272 where @xmath159 is the parameter of the degeneration .",
