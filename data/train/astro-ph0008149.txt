    "a significant fraction of the ultraviolet radiation emitted by massive stars impinges on the molecular gas associated with star formation .",
    "the resulting photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) therefore play an important role in reprocessing the energy flow in star - forming galaxies . modelling these",
    "pdrs is therefore an important theoretical challenge , both to test our understanding of the physical processes in interstellar gas , and to interpret observations of star - forming galaxies .",
    "it is frequently the case that the illuminating star is hot enough to produce an h  ii region , in which case the photodissociation region is bounded on one side by an ionization front , and on the other by cold molecular gas which has not yet been appreciably affected by ultraviolet radiation .",
    "the @xmath4ev photons propagating beyond the ionization front raise the fractional ionization , photoexcite and photodissociate the @xmath0 , and heat the gas via photoemission from dust and collisional deexcitation of vibrationally - excited h@xmath3 .",
    "figure [ fig : pdr_cartoon ] shows the different layers within a pdr .",
    "the lower rotational levels of @xmath0 tend to be in lte ( except perhaps for the ortho / para ratio , which adjusts relatively slowly ) , so we can use the relative level populations of @xmath0 as a pdr thermometer .",
    "we can also use the absolute column densities @xmath5 to tell us how much molecular gas is at different temperatures . because the @xmath0 quadrupole vibration - rotation lines are generally optically thin",
    ", only dust extinction affects the radiative transfer .",
    "the level populations @xmath5 can be studied using vibrational transitions ( ground - based k , h , j , i , r band spectroscopy ) or @xmath6=00 pure rotation lines ( some from the ground , but mainly from space , with iso or sirtf , or from the stratosphere , with sofia ) .",
    "the central physical process in a pdr is the photoexcitation and photodissociation of @xmath0 through the lyman and werner band lines of @xmath0 , and it is therefore important to model this process accurately . in our models",
    "( draine & bertoldi 1996 ) we explicitly include radiative transfer in the 28765 permitted lyman and werner band lines between @xmath0 levels with @xmath7 , using wavelengths and oscillator strengths from abgrall & roueff ( 1989 ) and abgrall et al .",
    "( 1993a , b ) .",
    "the lines are treated independently assuming voigt line profiles and attenuation by dust , but we include a a statistical correction for the effects of line overlap of the @xmath0 lines ( draine & bertoldi 1996 ) .",
    "lyman and werner band photons are absorbed by @xmath0 in the ground electronic state x@xmath8 , resulting in excitation to vibration - rotation levels of either the b@xmath9 or c@xmath10 electronic states .",
    "the electronically - excited state will decay by spontaneous emission of an ultraviolet photon .",
    "about 85% of the downward transitions will be to a bound @xmath11 level of the ground electronic state , but about 15% of the transitions will be to the vibrational continuum of the ground electronic state , producing two h atoms , typically moving apart with a kinetic energy of a fraction of @xmath121  ev ( stephens & dalgarno 1973 ) .",
    "bertoldi & draine ( 1996 ) discussed the propagation of coupled ionization - dissociation fronts , and showed that except when the pdr is driven by radiation from a very hot star , it is usually the case that the pdr moves into the molecular cloud slowly enough that thermal and chemical conditions are close to being in steady - state balance : most importantly , @xmath0 destruction is nearly balanced by @xmath0 formation , and heating is nearly balanced by cooling .",
    "it is then convenient to approximate the structure of the pdr by requiring precise thermochemical steady state at each point .",
    "the @xmath0 abundance is therefore determined by a balance between destruction by photodissociation and formation on grains , r_grn ( ) = _ pd n ( ) where @xmath13 is the local rate for photodissociation of @xmath0 , and @xmath14 is the rate coefficient for @xmath0 formation on grains , with the grain abundance assumed proportional to @xmath15 .",
    "we solve for the steady - state populations of the 299 bound @xmath11 levels with @xmath7 , including uv pumping , spontaneous decay , and collisional transitions .",
    "the distribution over @xmath11 of newly - formed @xmath0 produced on grain surfaces is uncertain ; our models allow us to consider various possibilities .",
    "the gas is heated primarily by photoelectrons ejected from dust grains , and ( for densities @xmath16 ) collisional deexcitation of vibrationally - excited @xmath0 resulting from uv pumping . in our models we use photoelectric heating rates estimated by weingartner & draine ( 2000a ) ; we assume dust with @xmath17 with 5% of the solar carbon in ultrasmall carbonaceous grains .",
    "the cooling of the gas is dominated by [ cii]158@xmath2 , [ siii]35@xmath2 , [ oi]63@xmath2 , and [ feii]26@xmath2 .",
    "the [ oi]63@xmath2 line is often optically thick ; we use an escape probability treatment .",
    "the b1.5v star hd  37903 is situated just outside the surface of the l1630 molecular cloud , resulting in the famous reflection nebula ngc 2023 .",
    "many emission lines of @xmath0 have now been measured for ngc 2023 , making it an ideal test for pdr models .",
    "high resolution images of ngc 2023 in the 1 - 0s(1 ) line have recently been published ( rouan et al .",
    "1997 ; field et al .",
    "1998 ; mccartney et al .  1999 ) , showing pronounced filamentary structure , notably strong emission along the `` southern bar '' 78@xmath18 south of hd  37903 .",
    "black & van dishoeck ( 1987 ) produced the first models to explain the @xmath0 fluorescence from ngc 2023 .",
    "their favored model assumed cold @xmath0 with a density @xmath19 and an ultraviolet radiation field enhanced by a factor @xmath20 relative to the habing ( 1968 ) intensity .",
    "draine & bertoldi ( 1996 ) argued that some warm gas with @xmath21k with density @xmath22 was required to explain the observed line ratios .",
    "new observations have become available both from the ground ( burton et al .  1998 ; mccartney et al .",
    "1999 ) and from iso ( bertoldi et al .",
    "2000a ) . from ground - based spectrophotometry of the bright `` southern emission bar '' it is now clear that the foreground extinction at k is @xmath23mag , implying a far - red extinction @xmath24mag . for each observed @xmath0 emission line",
    "we compute the column density @xmath5 in the excited state required to reproduce the observed surface brightness , for an assumed foreground extinction @xmath25mag .",
    "a detailed discussion of our modelling of ngc 2023 will be reported elsewhere , but here we show one example of a model developed to reproduce the observations of the southern emission bar .",
    "we assume the incident radiation field to be enhanced by a factor @xmath26 relative to the habing ( 1968 ) flux , and a gas density @xmath27 .",
    "the pdr is assumed to be plane - parallel , inclined relative to the line of sight with @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the angle between the normal to the pdr (= the direction from the pdr to the illuminating star ) and the direction to the earth .    in figures [ fig : v=12345][fig : v=89101112 ] we show @xmath30 for the model together with the observed level populations , versus the energy @xmath31 of the excited state .",
    "open symbols are model results ; filled symbols are observations .",
    "the model is seen to be in quite good agreement with the populations of the vibrationally - excited levels all the way up to @xmath32 ! the generally excellent agreement between model and observations indicates that the description of the ultraviolet pumping process is basically sound .",
    "the fact that for a given vibrational level the rotational level populations appear to be in good agreement with observations indicates that the model has approximately the correct temperature and density . only for a few weak lines are the reported fluxes very different from the model predictions : 12 - 6  q(5)@xmath33 , where the reported flux is a factor of 20 stronger than expected , and 9 - 4  s(11)@xmath34 , where the observed flux is a factor @xmath127 stronger than expected . with so many other lines in good agreement ,",
    "perhaps these lines have been misidentified .",
    "note , however , that these are the only two lines from levels with @xmath35k , so perhaps there are processes populating these very high energy levels which have not been included in the model ( see bertoldi et al .",
    "2000b ) .",
    "figure [ fig : v=0 ] shows the @xmath36 level populations for our model , together with the level populations inferred from the iso observations toward ngc 2023 ( bertoldi et al .",
    "2000a ) , except that the surface brightnesses measured by the relatively large iso beam have been arbitrarily increased by a factor 1.8  the reasoning here is that the bright southern bar represents a region with unusually high limb - brightening , probably about a factor of 2 higher than the average over the iso beam . with this adjustment",
    ", we obtain quite good agreement for most of the rotational levels ; the largest discrepancy is for @xmath37 , where the model surface brightness is about twice the observed value .",
    "note that the observed emission from the @xmath38 level is in excellent agreement with the model !",
    "the level populations obviously depart strongly from a single - temperature fit ; this is mainly due to the range of gas temperatures present ( see figure [ fig:2023model ] ) and the excitation of newly - formed @xmath0 leaving grain surfaces .",
    "the model is shown in figure [ fig:2023model ] .",
    "photoelectric emission from dust grains dominates the heating over much of the pdr , but for @xmath39 the dominant heat source is collisional deexcitation of @xmath0 which has been vibrationally excited by uv pumping . the combination of photoelectric heating and heating by deexcitation of @xmath0 manages to maintain a gas temperature of @xmath40k over a substantial zone , with the gas temperature still as high as @xmath41k when the @xmath0 fraction has risen to 10% .",
    "the model assumes gas phase abundances c / h=@xmath42 ( 1/3 solar ) , o / h= @xmath43 ( 1/2 solar ) , si / h=@xmath44 ( 1/40 solar ) , fe / h=@xmath45 ( 1/250 solar ) . predicted fine structure line intensities for the bright southern bar ( for limb - brightening @xmath46 )",
    "are given in table [ tab : fs ] .",
    "most of the lines are not yet observed , but the intensity measured by iso for [ siii]34.8@xmath2 is only 1/25 of the model prediction !",
    "part of the discrepancy can be attributed to beam dilution : the iso beam is 660@xmath47 , whereas the bright bar is only @xmath1250@xmath47 .",
    "however , there presumably is [ si  ii ] emission away from the bar , so it appears likely that the si is depleted by @xmath12400 relative to solar .",
    "it is interesting to compare this with the s140 pdr , where the inferred si abundance was 1/40 solar ( timmermann et al .",
    "walmsley et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have recently discussed the puzzling variations in si abundance observed in pdrs .",
    "there are a number of areas for improvement in our modelling of pdrs :    * we need accurate cross sections for collisional excitation and dexcitation of @xmath0 . *",
    "we need to understand the details of the @xmath0 formation process in pdrs  the overall rate and the @xmath11 distribution of newly - formed @xmath0 . *",
    "the rate of photoelectric heating by dust is critical , particularly since drift of the dust grains can alter the dust / gas ratio in the pdr ( weingartner & draine 1999 , 2000b ) . * finally , we need more accurate spectroscophotometry , with refined angular resolution , to allow us to understand the geometry of the filaments and sheets which are apparent in high - resolution images of ngc 2023 and other pdrs .         1989 , _",
