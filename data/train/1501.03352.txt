    "large - scale optical surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have provided numerous and homogeneous data for studying the properties of quasars and other subjects including connections to their host galaxies , igm , ly@xmath5 forests , quasar clustering , central supermassive black holes , and baryon acoustic oscillations @xcite , etc .",
    "quasar targets for spectroscopic observations in the sdss are mainly selected by optical colors @xcite .",
    "outliers away from the star sequence in color space are considered as spectroscopic follow - up candidates . due to strong ultraviolet excess and emission lines , quasars with redshift",
    "lower than 2.2 or higher than 3.0 are obviously far from the star locus in color - color diagrams . a lack of or not so deep @xmath0 band would significantly impact the ability to select the low - redshift quasars .",
    "optical colors of quasars in the redshift range of @xmath6 are similar to those of a - colored stars ( blue horizontal branch stars and blue stragglers ) so that it is very difficult and inefficient to select quasars only by simple color cuts @xcite .",
    "there are two alternatives that can help to pick out those quasar targets more efficiently .",
    "one is combining optical and near - infrared ( nir ) photometry , e.g. the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ; * ? ? ?",
    ". the decreasing rate of a stellar continuum from optical to nir wavelength is larger than that of a quasar .",
    "optical colors together with infrared colors are utilized to distinguish quasars at @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the optical variability is the other way to select quasar candidates .",
    "its role will become more and more prominent with the ongoing or up - coming time - domain surveys such as the palomar transient factory ( ptf ; * ? ? ? * ) , panoramic survey telescope & rapid response system ( pan - starrs ; * ? ? ? * ) , and large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "light curves have been parameterized by a structure function or a damped random walk model @xcite .",
    "quasars , variables and non - variable stars can be successfully separated with a great completeness and purity in the parameter space .",
    "however , quasar targeting by light curves needs tens of time sampling points , and only limited sky areas have deep time - series photometric observations .",
    "the @xmath0-band variability is the largest among the five sdss bands and it becomes larger as the time lag is longer . the magnitude change in @xmath0 band might be helpful for quasar targeting selection .",
    "the scuss is an imaging survey in the south galactic cap ( sgp ) with an sdss - like @xmath0 filter@xcite .",
    "the survey is about 1.5 mag deeper than the sdss @xmath0 band .",
    "it is expected that , comparing with target selections only by sdss photometry , one can select more quasars with less star contamination by using both deep scuss @xmath0 band and sdss other bands if objects present no variability .",
    "the scuss observations started in 2010 and ended in 2013 .",
    "the average time lag between scuss and sdss observations is about 23 years .",
    "we can obtain the two - epoch @xmath0-band variability between these two surveys . the variability difference between quasars and stars",
    "is useful for quasar selection . in this paper",
    ", we compare the quasar selection by combining the scuss and sdss data with that only by the sdss data and try to understand the quasar targeting potential and capability when the scuss @xmath0 band is involved . in section [ sec2 ] ,",
    "we give brief descriptions of the scuss and our quasar and star samples .",
    "section [ sec3 ] presents some advantages of the scuss @xmath0-band photometric data , which are favourable for the quasar selection .",
    "quasar selections by combining scuss and sdss data are analyzed and discussed in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "section [ sec5 ] is the conclusion .",
    "the scuss is undertaken by the national astronomical observatories of china .",
    "the adopted telescope is the 2.3 m bok telescope located on kitt peak , arizona .",
    "the camera deployed at the prime focus provides a field of view of about 1 square degree .",
    "the photometric system is the sdss - like @xmath0 filter , whose effective wavelength is about 3538  and fwhm is about 520  @xcite .",
    "the filter is a little bluer than the sdss @xmath0 band .",
    "the scuss covers an area of about 5000 square degrees in the sgp .",
    "the exposure time is 5 minutes and the 5-@xmath8 magnitude limit is deeper than 23.0 mag .",
    "the detailed image processing and photometry for the scuss can be referred to the paper of @xcite . in general , the global astrometric accuracy is about 0.13 .",
    "the catalogs include both photometry for stacked images and co - added photometry for single - epoch images .",
    "the co - added psf magnitudes and co - added aperture magnitudes , if a proper aperture radius is chosen , are the best brightness measurements of point sources . in this paper , we use the co - added psf magnitude .",
    "the scuss magnitude is converted to the sdss photometric system using the transformation equation of @xmath9 where @xmath10 .",
    "the corresponding error of the transformed scuss @xmath0-band magnitude is estimated by error transfer .",
    "this transformation is derived by point sources with scuss and sdss photometric errors less than 0.05 mag .",
    "it is applied to point sources here and the maximum systematic difference between scuss and sdss is about 0.036 mag .",
    "the sdss magnitudes are psf magnitudes . in the rest of this paper ,",
    "all magnitudes are corrected by the galactic extinction map of @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopically confirmed quasars and stars are obtained by matching objects from the sdss dr10 with scuss catalogs .",
    "we require that scuss objects are not saturated and not polluted by other sources and the sdss classifications are point - like .",
    "the @xmath11-band magnitude is limited to the range between 18 and 22.5 mag .",
    "there are 42418 quasars and 56518 stars in total .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows some properties of these two samples including the distributions of the @xmath12 magnitude , @xmath13 color , and redshift ( only for quasars ) .",
    "there are two peaks in the redshift distribution of quasars , locating in the ultraviolet - excess region and at intermediate redshift , respectively .",
    "most mid - redshift quasars are obtained by the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which plans to map the large - scale structure traced by the ly-@xmath5 forest .",
    "the scuss @xmath0 band is reported to be 1.5 mag deeper than the sdss @xmath0 band .",
    "we plot the magnitude error as a function of magnitude in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the 5-@xmath8 magnitude limits at @xmath14 for the scuss and sdss @xmath0 bands are 23.45 and 22.03 mag , respectively .",
    "the magnitude error of the sdss @xmath0-band at 22.0 mag , officially defined as the limiting magnitude of 95% detection repeatability for point sources , is about 0.2 mag , while that of the scuss @xmath0-band is about 0.05 mag .",
    "another intuitive comparison of the data quality between these two surveys is to plot color - color diagrams and see the color dispersion of faint main - sequence stars .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the distributions of both quasar and star samples in the color - color plane of @xmath13 or @xmath15 vs. @xmath16 .",
    "the color dispersion of stars with scuss @xmath0 is obviously smaller than that with sdss @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath15 dispersion at @xmath17 ( mostly faint m stars ) is about 0.55 , while the @xmath13 dispersion is about 0.76 .",
    "in addition , in the region occupied by quasars with @xmath18 , there are many stars initially selected as quasar candidates by the sdss as shown in the left of figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "they are mostly faint stars with large sdss @xmath0-band photometric errors",
    ". however , most of these stars are still in the main sequence due to deeper scuss @xmath0-band as seen in the right panel of this figure .",
    "the deeper scuss @xmath0 band with sdss other bands will evidently improve the quasar selection if quasars present no variability .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig3 ] , many quasars with @xmath19 are mixed with a - colored stars .",
    "the target selections only based on optical colors are inefficient for these quasars .",
    "however , quasars usually present light variabilities . in principle",
    ", the variability would be larger as the wavelength is shorter and the observation lag is longer .",
    "the @xmath0-band variability is largest among all sdss bands .",
    "there is a typical observation time lag of 23 years between the scuss and sdss .",
    "thus , the two - epoch @xmath0-band variability between these two surveys should be large enough as a useful tool to select quasar targets .",
    "the quasar selection by variability should also be complementary to other selection methods based on colors , especially for quasars with @xmath19 .",
    "we compare the two - epoch magnitude differences of both stars and quasars in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "only objects with photometric errors less than 0.05 mag are considered .",
    "the standard deviations of the distributions for stars and quasars are about 0.06 mag and 0.3 mag , respectively .",
    "the scatter of stars mainly comes from the photometric error , while the scatter for quasars might come from the photometric error , intrinsic variability , and photometric system difference between the scuss and sdss .",
    "anyhow , the difference of the distributions between quasars and stars are distinct .",
    "it can be used to separate these two kinds of objects .",
    "the large two - epoch magnitude differences of quasars are also implied in the broader @xmath15 color distributions in the right of figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "the scuss @xmath0 filter is very similar to the sdss @xmath0 filter , but it is a little bluer . the central wavelength of the scuss @xmath0 band is about 3538  , while that of the sdss @xmath0 is about 3562  @xcite .",
    "stellar spectra are dominated by the continuum , so their photometric differences between the scuss and sdss as shown in equation ( [ equ1 ] ) is small .",
    "the photometric effect due to different photometric systems is less than 0.036 mag for main - sequence stars .",
    "however , quasar spectra present strong ultraviolet excess and emission lines .",
    "their photometric differences should be much bigger .",
    "we get 4000 quasar spectra with different redshifts from the sdss dr10 .",
    "the wavelength of sdss spectra ranges from 3800 to 9200  , which is out of the @xmath0-band wavelength coverage .",
    "these quasar spectra are blue - shifted by @xmath20 so that they can be convolved with two @xmath0 filter responses to generate synthetic magnitudes . here , both scuss and sdss filter responses are the ones with atmospheric extinction at the typical airmass of 1.3 @xcite . the resulting magnitude difference between these two filters is plotted as a function of redshift in figure [ fig5 ] . in another way , we redshift the quasar composite spectrum by different redshift values and check the systematic variation with redshift as also shown in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "these two data sets present a coincident variation .",
    "most quasars lie in a narrow band along the redshift .",
    "the wave - shape variation along the redshift is because of different emission lines entering and departing from the @xmath0 band .",
    "the magnitude difference is less than 0.03 when @xmath21 .",
    "it goes up to about 0.1 mag when @xmath22 , which is caused by the strongest ly@xmath5 line in quasar spectra .",
    "in contrast with stars , it is evident that quasars present much more difference induced by different photometric filters .",
    "this kind of difference is helpful for discriminating quasars from stars .",
    "thus , we do not need to correct it and assume the magnitude difference mainly come from intrinsic variability if the photometric error is ignorable .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows photometric magnitude differences of quasars between the scuss and sdss @xmath0 bands as a function of redshift .",
    "the photometric errors are limited to 0.1 mag , which approximately corresponds to the quasar redshift up to about 3 .",
    "we find that the average quasar variability varies at a level of 0.04 mag in the redshift range of 03 .",
    "thus , the two - epoch variability is almost independent on the redshift , which can help to discover more quasars with @xmath23 where variability is still available .",
    "the independence of variability on redshift in @xmath24 bands was also confirmed by @xcite who divided the quasars into different subsamples with different physical parameters .",
    "quasar target selections in this section are investigated based on the consideration of whether objects presenting variability . those objects with two - epoch variability less than three times",
    "the photometric errors are regarded as sources with ignorable or small variabilities , which can be expressed as @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the scuss and sdss @xmath0-band magnitude errors , respectively .",
    "there are 68.4% quasars and 96.9% stars of their total samples with @xmath29 .",
    "these objects have deeper scuss @xmath0 band and hence deeper intrinsic colors .",
    "it is imaginable that the scuss @xmath0 band instead of the sdss @xmath0 band would undoubtedly improve the efficiency of the quasar selection when combined with sdss other bands .    in order to show the advantage of the quasar selection based on scuss data , we introduce a flux - based quasar target selection algorithm , xdqso , which applies the extreme - deconvolution method to evaluate the probability that an object is a quasar @xcite . by applying the xdqso method to the above non - variable samples",
    ", we can know how many more quasars can be selected with scuss @xmath0 and sdss @xmath2 data than with sdss - only data .",
    "the probability of an object that selected as a quasar in xdqso is set to be larger than 0.9 .    after the xdqso method is applied to the non - variable samples with scuss @xmath0 and sdss @xmath2",
    "photometric data , about 46.6% quasars and 2.9% stars are selected .",
    "when it is applied to sdss @xmath3 data , about 41.4% quasars and 2.4% stars are selected .",
    "there are about 24.0% quasars that are exclusively selected by xdqso with scuss @xmath0 and sdss @xmath2 data .",
    "these numbers are summarized in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] shows the magnitude and redshift distributions of quasars selected by these two methods .",
    "the distributions of total samples with ignorable variability and quasars exclusively selected by the xdqso with scuss data are also overlaid in this figure .",
    "the target selection with scuss data can select more faint quasars with magnitude peak at 21.5 mag and more quasars with redshift between 2 and 3 ( peak at @xmath30 ) .",
    "we also check the quasar selection efficiencies within two different redshift ranges : @xmath31 and @xmath32 , which are also presented in table [ tab1 ] . as a result , there are respectively 15.6% and 31.2% more quasars that are selected by the xdqso with scuss data than that with sdss - only data . the selection here is based on known quasar samples , most of which are selected through sdss optical colors .",
    "the scuss @xmath0 band is deeper than that of the sdss , which implies that a part of potential quasars close to the sdss @xmath0-band magnitude limit are missing .",
    "the scuss data can help us find more faint quasars than the above experiment only based on the known samples .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the sdss @xmath0-band photometric error is larger than the scuss @xmath0 band , which is more prominent close to the sdss magnitude limit .",
    "so the selection by variability is limited to a brighter magnitude range than the xdqso selection with scuss @xmath0 plus sdss @xmath2 data .",
    "the xdqso selection with the scuss plus sdss data can select more fainter quasars and quasars with redshift peaked at 2.2 , while the selection by variability can select more low - redshift and mid - redshift quasars .",
    "these two selections are complementary and make the most of the scuss @xmath0-band advantages .",
    "we randomly select a region of about 10 deg@xmath1 with consistent scuss imaging quality to demonstrate the capability of our quasar selection with full point sources from the sdss . the quasar probability in xdqso",
    "is still set to be larger than 0.9 .",
    "the scuss u - band apparent magnitude is limitted to 23.5 mag .",
    "the @xmath11-band magnitude is between 18 and 22.5 mag .",
    "isolated sources classified as point - like by the sdss are considered . when objects present ignorable variability , the selection with scuss and sdss data can find 29% more quasar targets than the one only with the sdss data . on the other hand , the selection by variability can find 168.7% additional targets , although star comtamination would be more serious . in total , we find that our selection can select 87.7% additional quasar targets .",
    "however , its actual application with alterable parameters , such as the quasar probability in the xdqso and the variability amplitude ( several times larger than the photometric error ) , should be dependent on the requirements of the density and homogeneity of quasar targets , the selection efficiency , and magnitude range , etc .",
    "the scuss provides a deep and wide imaging survey in an about 5000 deg@xmath1 area of the south galactic cap with @xmath0 band .",
    "the scuss @xmath0-band is deeper than the sdss @xmath0 band and the observation time lag between the scuss and sdss provides an opportunity to investigate the two - epoch variability . through combining the scuss and sdss data",
    ", we evaluate the capability of the quasar selection in consideration of the advantages of the scuss @xmath0 band data",
    ".    the deeper scuss @xmath0-band photometry makes stars and quasars more tightly distributed in the color - color diagrams if sdss other bands are included and objects present no variability .",
    "it helps to select more fainter quasars .",
    "quasars have power - law continua and many strong emission lines .",
    "the photometric difference for quasars due to different photometric systems is larger than that of stars , which is helpful for the separation of these two objects .",
    "the average variability of quasars is about 0.3 mag .",
    "the distribution of the two - epoch variability between the scuss and sdss for quasars is quite different from that of stars . besides , the quasar two - epoch variability is independent on redshift at a level of 0.04 mag ( @xmath33 )",
    ".    based on the above advantages , we analyze the quasar selection in two ways : one is combining the scuss deeper @xmath0-band data and sdss @xmath2 data when objects present ignorable variability ; the other is utilizing the two - epoch variability .",
    "the xdqso method , which gives the quasar probability , is introduced for comparisons .",
    "we find that the xdqso method with scuss @xmath0 and sdss @xmath2 data can select more faint quasars and quasars with redshift around 2.2 than the xdqso with sdss @xmath3 data .",
    "there are about 24.0% quasars exclusively selected by the former .",
    "the scuss data can also help us find the missing quasars close to the sdss @xmath0-band magnitude limit .",
    "we regard objects with @xmath34 as quasar candidates with obvious variability , because there are relatively small fraction of stars with such large variability .",
    "the quasar selection by variability can select both low - redshift quasars and mid - redshift quasars with @xmath35 .",
    "there are 25.7% quasars exclusively selected by variability .",
    "the above two quasar selections are complementary , which make full use of the scuss advantages .",
    "when applying to the full sdss point sources , our method can also select about 87.7% additional quasar targets .",
