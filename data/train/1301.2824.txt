    "<S> a hole - like fs is predicted around the m points as indicated by the orange dashed lines in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fsmap](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is due to the fermi level crossing of o  @xmath25 derived states from the valence band maximum of the topmost monolayer of the lao film . since the photoelectron current emitted from the surface is hardly damped by scattering events and since the band is almost completely filled , these hole pockets , if existing , should be observable even without resonance enhancement . in the standard electronic reconstruction scenario [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : banddiagrams](a ) ] the polarity - induced potential build - up across the overlayer gradually shifts the valence band of lao towards the fermi level . at the critical thickness , the valence band maximum crosses the fermi level which gives rise to the hole pockets predicted by the dft calculations , while the released electrons populate the lowest lying ti  @xmath1 states at the sto side of the interface @xcite .    from the obvious absence of metallic surface bands </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the potential difference is ( almost completely ) screened out in the lao film @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a possible explanation could be that under illumination electron - hole pairs are created which get separated by the initial polarization field in the lao [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : banddiagrams](b ) ] . eventually , depending on the rates for electron - hole pair creation and recombination a dynamic equilibrium will be established where the opposing electric field due to the separated electron - hole pairs just cancels the initial field , thus prohibiting the observation of the surface related hole pocket . on the other hand , in another polar / non - polar heterostructure ( lacro@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 ) a built - in potential has readily been identified by x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) with a similar potential drop per uc as predicted for lao / sto in the standard electronic reconstruction scenario @xcite .    looking for alternative explanations , our sx - arpes results </S>",
    "<S> could also be fully reconciled within recent proposals , also based on dft calculations , that oxygen vacancies at the lao surface can serve as charge reservoir for the electronic reconstruction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in such a scenario the o vacancies induce unoccupied in - gap states , which due to possible disorder of the vacancies in the real system might easily become localized . the released two electrons per o vacancy are transferred to the interface by the lao polar field . </S>",
    "<S> this field is thereby efficiently reduced [ see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : banddiagrams](c ) ] , in line with xps measurements which show no core - level broadening or shift with film thickness @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> viewing the lao film as a parallel plate capacitor the energy gain per charge transferred from the surface to the interface increases linearly with film thickness . while the energy costs for the creation of oxygen vacancies can depend also on thickness ( and in addition on vertical position ) , the calculations show that at a certain thickness it becomes on balance favorable to create an oxygen vacancy at the surface and transfer the released electrons to the interface @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that o vacancies in the sto can be excluded with fair certainty as source of electrons for the 2des . </S>",
    "<S> first , their density essentially does not depend on film thickness but on the growth conditions and so the critical thickness behavior as observed in our samples could hardly be explained @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second , in our data the electrons associated with o vacancies in the sto ( feature @xmath11 ) are well separated and far below the 2des related states at the chemical potential ( feature @xmath12 ) and thus can not populate the 2des related states .    </S>",
    "<S> summarizing our results we arrive at the picture that at the conducting interface besides heavy ti  @xmath26 and light ti  @xmath22 bands there also exist _ localized _ </S>",
    "<S> charge carriers of ti  @xmath1 character . </S>",
    "<S> these are probably trapped by adjacent o vacancies , i.e. o vacancies in the sto at the interface . </S>",
    "<S> it is hence tempting to associate the trapped and mobile interface charge with ferromagnetism and superconductivity , respectively @xcite , which both have recently been reported to coexist at the interface . as a matter of fact , the hallmarks of the microscopic view of the standard electronic reconstruction scenario  a metallic surface and a potential drop across the lao overlayer of the order of the sto band gap </S>",
    "<S>  experimentally remained elusive so far . </S>",
    "<S> our data clearly indicate that they are absent in our spectroscopic experiments . </S>",
    "<S> modified electronic reconstruction scenarios involving surface o vacancies as charge reservoir could explain these findings . </S>",
    "<S> since we can not rule out the possibility that the lao polar field is screened out by a photoinduced reverse voltage our results call for both a systematic investigation of scenarios taking o vacancies into account and combined _ in situ _ transport and spectroscopy experiments . in any case , these results demonstrate for the first time that sx - arpes can provide valuable @xmath2-space information on the electronic structure of _ buried _ interfaces .    </S>",
