    "graphene has been a topic of intensive investigation since the pioneering work on synthesis of this unique two - dimensional material by geim , novoselov and co - workers @xcite .",
    "recently , various attempts have been made to fabricate graphene devices by engineering their band gaps by doping @xcite .",
    "investigations on doped graphene nano - ribbons @xcite indicate that upon doping by n or b n - type or p - type semiconducting graphene can possibly be obtained .",
    "it has been experimentally established that upon n doping of graphene @xcite , the dirac point in the band structure of graphene tends to move below the @xmath0 and an energy gap appears at high - symmetric k - point .",
    "very recently , ci et al .",
    "@xcite have been able to synthesize a novel two - dimensional nanomaterial where a few carbon atoms on a graphene sheet is replaced by equal number of b and n atoms .",
    "the concentration of the dopant atoms can be controlled by keeping b / n ratio same .",
    "this novel bnc nanomaterial was found be semiconducting with a very small gap between the valence and conduction bands .",
    "synthesis of similar bnc materials have also been reported by panchakarla et al . @xcite .",
    "the electronic properties of n and b doped graphene nanoribbons with armchair edges also has been reported @xcite .",
    "n introduces an impurity level above the donor level , while an impurity level introduced by b is below that of the acceptor level .",
    "in contrast to single wall carbon nanotubes , the impurity level is neither donor nor acceptor in their systems .",
    "the donor and acceptor levels are derived mainly from the lowest unoccupied orbital and the highest occupied orbital .    theoretically , there are various possibilities to introduce gap in graphene , i.e. by oxidation of monovacancies in graphene @xcite , graphene / boron nitride heterobilayers @xcite , f - intercalated graphene on sic substrate @xcite , and bilayer graphene - bn heterostructures . experimentally , substitutional carbon doping of boron nitride nanosheets , nanoribbons , and nanotubes has been reported @xcite .",
    "experimentally , it has been observed that the @xmath1 hybridized bnc nano - structure , with equal number of b and n atoms , can open finite band gap @xcite .    motivated by these current experimental and theoretical reports , we investigated in this paper the effect of doping of boron and nitrogen and also of their co - doping on the electronic properties of the graphene systems using first - principles electronic structure calculations based on density functional theory .",
    "our results indicate that due to the presence of b or n atoms graphene is more stable as compared to pristine @xmath2-bn .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath2-bnc domains are more likely to form in @xmath2-cbn nanomaterial .",
    "the electronic properties of graphene with single substitutional b or n atoms , indicative of a @xmath3 ( @xmath4)-doping , can be tuned easily as reported recently @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have carried out extensive band structure calculations @xcite in the framework of the local spin - density formalism ( lsda ) using first - principles pseudopotentials @xcite and examined the effect of b and n doped multilayers graphene .",
    "to best of our knowledge , the stability and electronic properties of such a system has not been well understood .",
    "we believe our results explain the formation of @xmath2-bnc nano - materials as it has been proven experimentally @xcite .",
    "these new form of hybridized @xmath2-bnc nanomaterial enables for the development of band gap engineering applications , in particular , in nano - electronics and nano - optics that are distinct from those of pristine graphene and pristine @xmath2-bn .",
    "unit cell of graphene codoped with equal number of b and n atoms with carbon concentrations of 75%   ( left ) , 50%   ( middle ) and 25%   ( right ) used in the calculation.,scaledwidth=120.0% ]    the calculations were performed using quantum espresso code @xcite .",
    "the code has already been used successfully for graphene and @xmath2-bn systyems @xcite .",
    "the atomic positions and cell parameters are fully relaxed in all cases , until an energy convergence of 10@xmath5 ev and a force convergence of 0.04 ev /   is reached .",
    "first , we obtained the total energy of pristine graphene using self - consistent calculation and then the band structure , densities of states ( dos ) , partial density of states ( pdos ) and charge densities @xcite .",
    "we have checked different sets of pseudopotentials and find von barth @xcite pseudopotentials is reasonable good for our present calculations .",
    "hence , we used von barth with wave function and charge - density cut - offs of 60  ryd and 600  ryd , respectively and obtained quite accurate vales of in - plane and out - of - plane lattice constant @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively by the process of the total energy minimization .",
    "after getting the relaxed structures , we performed self consistent calculations with a monkhorst - pack @xcite @xmath8 k - mesh followed by the non - self consistent calculations for band structures , dos / pdos and charge density separately .",
    "we have used @xmath9 k - points mesh along the path @xmath10 in the irreducible brillouin zone to obtain the band structure with very fine mesh points .",
    "next , the doping of graphene was carried out using a @xmath11 supercell of graphene with one atom replaced by b or n and the band structure was obtained without changing the lattice constant .",
    "however , ionic relaxation has been taken into account and finally , we performed band structures and dos / pdos calculations . turning in to the multilayered structure , we first considered b or n doped two - layer ( abab stacked ) graphene with different concentrations of b and n atoms . thereafter , we performed band structures and dos / pdos calculations as similar as discussed above .",
    "finally , we have performed the relaxation , band structures and density of states calculations for three - layers of b or n doped graphene with similar stacking as above by keeping the interlayer spacing same as in graphite calculated earlier @xcite .",
    "based on lwdin population analysis , it is confirmed that in b - doped case the charge is concentrated on the c sites whereas , in n - doped case the charge is concentrated in n site .",
    "thereafter , we carried out calculations for co - doping of b and n using a @xmath11 supercell of graphene by replacing c atoms by one , two or three b and same number of n atoms , yielding a concentration of 75% , 50% or 25% of c atoms and corresponding concentration of 25% , 50% and 75% of bn atoms , respectively .",
    "the lattice was allowed to relax and the in - plane lattice constant was obtained self - consistently by minimizing the total energy for each of these configurations .",
    "the cut - off energies in this case for wave function and charge - density were 100  ryd and 1000  ryd respectively .",
    "the band structure was obtained for ( @xmath9 ) @xmath12-points along the path @xmath10 exactly similar process as mentioned above .",
    "similar kinds of study was also performed for multilayers ( abab - stacked ) of such bnc sheet with interlayer separation 3.29   , which is average of the interlayer separations of pristine graphite and pristine @xmath2-bn calculated using same pseudopotentials as discussed above @xcite .",
    "in the fig .",
    "2 , we show the calculated band structure of undoped , b - doped and n - doped graphene for a single - layer , two - layers and three - layers , respectively .",
    "we clearly observe that the dirac point for undoped graphene moves above ( below ) the @xmath0 upon doping by b ( n ) .",
    "b ( @xmath13 ) has one valence electron less whereas n ( @xmath14 ) has one more than carbon ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "therefore , doping by b ( n ) results as hole ( electron ) doping of graphene resulting into shifting of the bands to accommodate extra hole ( electron ) . for b doped graphene",
    ", we show the band structure together with the dos(pdos ) in left panel of the fig .",
    "3 . the dirac cone shifts above at @xmath0 by 2 ev with finite splitting and the linear dispersion of pristine graphene disappears . above the @xmath0 the @xmath16 band contributed from the @xmath17 orbital of the b and @xmath18 band contributed from the @xmath17 orbital of c. however , for n",
    "doped graphene we obtain the band structure together with the dos(pdos ) as shown in right panel of the fig .  3 .",
    "the dirac cone shifts below the @xmath0 by 1.5 ev with finite splitting . below the e@xmath19 the @xmath16 band contributed from the @xmath17 orbital of the c and @xmath18 band contributed from the @xmath17 orbital of n. in the electron doping more states are pulled below the @xmath0 whereas for hole doping the reverse is the case .        in the fig .  4",
    ", we show the band structure of graphene co - doped with both b and n. the number of b and n atoms were kept same and calculations were performed for three configurations with concentration of c atoms to be 75% , 50% and 25% , respectively .",
    "we clearly observe the appearance of a band gap ( summarized in table i ) at the high - symmetric k - point in the brillouin zone , which depends sensitively on the doping - concentration and also on the thickness of the layers .",
    "we find for each c concentration , the band gap decreases with increasing number of layers . also , with increasing b and n atom concentration the band gap increases .",
    "the calculated band gaps for 75% c concentration are 1.06 ev , 0.6 ev and 0.46 ev ; for 50% c concentration are 1.8 ev , 1.36 ev and 0.45 ev ; and for 25% c concentration are 3.05 ev , 2.49 ev and 0.44 ev ; for one - layer , two - layers and three - layers samples respectively .",
    "the gap occurs due to mixed hybridization of valence states of b and n with that of c atoms .",
    "these results are found to be in qualitative agreement with experimental measurement .",
    "the calculated value of band gap presented in table i shows that such nano - materials may have potential application in nano - scale semiconducting and nano - scale optoelectronic devices .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have examined the origin of the gap in the band structure due to b or n doping by calculating the pdos on different atomic sites , which is not shown here .",
    "we have found that the dos near the gap is essentially of @xmath17 character occurring from the anti - bonding ( bonding ) @xmath17 b ( n ) states hybridizing with those of bonding ( anti - bonding ) @xmath17 states of carbon .",
    "the position of the energy gap due to such hybridization is very crucial such that upon co - doping of graphene by equal number of b and n the energy gap occurs at the @xmath0 . thus a band gap may be engineered in graphene by doping in equal amount of electron and hole .",
    "in summary , we used @xmath20-initio density functional theory to investigate the effect of the b and n doped graphene . shifting and splitting of the dirac cone below and above the e@xmath19 by n and b doping",
    "is observed .",
    "the band structures , dos / pdos and charge density for @xmath2-bcn hybrid structures are explicitly studied .",
    "we found that the band gap energy increases quadratically with respect to the bn concentrations in the range 25% to 75% keeping b to n ratio same .",
    "these results may provide guidance in practical engineering applications , specially to tune the band gap in graphene .",
    "finally , our results are useful to provide an explain of the formation of @xmath2-bnc nano - materials @xcite .",
    "these new form of hybridized @xmath2-bnc material enables for the development of band gap engineering and applications , in particular , in nano - electronics and nano - optics .",
    "a further study should be performed in order to shed light on this issue , in particular energy path and activation barrier .",
