    "in spite of the long history of theoretical investigations of the pion , its properties are still not fully understood .",
    "for instance , no consensus on the behaviour of the pion elastic form factor in the region @xmath13 gev@xmath5 has been reached up to now ( see fig .  [ plot:1 ] ) ; the recent babar results on the @xmath14 transition form factor @xcite imply a strong violation of pqcd factorization in the region of @xmath6 up to 40 gev@xmath5 .    [",
    "cols=\"^ \" , ]     moreover  in evident conflict with the @xmath15 and @xmath16 results and the experience from quantum mechanics ",
    "the data implies that the violations of ld increase with @xmath6 even in the region @xmath11",
    "! the effective threshold extracted from the babar data is compatible with a linear growing function of @xmath6 with no sign of approaching the ld limit .",
    "it is hard to find a convincing answer to the question why nonstrange components in @xmath15 , @xmath16 , on the one hand , and in @xmath17 , on the other hand , should behave so much differently ?",
    "we presented the analysis of the pion elastic and the @xmath17 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 transition form factors from the ld version of qcd sum rules .",
    "the main emphasis was laid on the attempt to probe the accuracy of this approximate method and the reliability of its predictions .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows :    * * the elastic form factor * : our quantum - mechanical analysis suggests that the ld model should work increasingly well in the region @xmath18 gev@xmath5 , independently of the details of the confining interaction . for arbitrary confining interaction ,",
    "the ld model gives very accurate results for @xmath19 gev@xmath5 .",
    "the accurate data on the pion form factor at small momentum transfers indicate that the ld limit for the effective threshold , @xmath20 , may be reached already at relatively low values @xmath21 gev@xmath5 ; thus , large deviations from the ld limit at @xmath8  gev@xmath5 reported in some recent publications @xcite appear to us rather unlikely . *",
    "* the @xmath22 transition form factor * : we conclude from the quantum - mechanical analysis that the ld model should work well in the region @xmath23 a few gev@xmath5 . indeed , for the @xmath24 and @xmath25 form factors , the predictions from ld model in qcd work reasonably well .",
    "surprisingly , for the @xmath26 form factor the present babar data indicate an increasing violation of local duality , corresponding to a linearly rising effective threshold , even at @xmath6 as large as 40 gev@xmath5 .",
    "this puzzle has so far no compelling theoretical explanation .",
    "our conclusion agrees with the findings of @xcite obtained from other theoretical approaches .",
