    "a number of lengthy observing campaigns covering individual @xmath11  scuti variables have shown that the majority of these pulsating variables on and near the main sequence pulsate with a large number of simultaneously excited nonradial p modes .",
    "furthermore , long - term variability of the pulsation amplitudes of these nonradial modes with a time scale of years has been discovered for many , but not all of these nonradial pulsators .",
    "the delta scuti network , hereafter called dsn , specializes in multisite observations of these stars .",
    "the network is a collaboration of astronomers located at observatories spaced around the globe in order to avoid regular , daily observing gaps .",
    "so far , 21 campaigns have been carried out . the most recent campaign covered bi  cmi , for which 29 frequencies of pulsation derived from 1024 hours ( 177 nights ) of photometry were discovered ( breger et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the variability of the star @xmath0  tau was discovered by horan ( 1977 , 1979 ) and confirmed by duerbeck ( 1978 ) . in order to study the multiple frequencies , the delta scuti network undertook two campaigns ( breger et al .",
    "1987 , 1989 : the latter is referred to as paper i ) .",
    "the data could be supplemented by additional measurements by kovacs & paparo ( 1989 ) .",
    "five frequencies of pulsation were detected and interpreted to be due to nonradial pulsation .",
    "the size and distribution of the frequencies suggested p modes with values of @xmath12 = 0 to 2 .",
    "a mode with a higher @xmath12 value was also detected spectroscopically by kennelly & walker ( 1996 ) . since the original analysis of the photometric data , new theoretical as well as experimentally determined ( breger et al .",
    "1993 ) statistical criteria for the acceptance or rejection of additional modes extracted from multisite photometric data have become available .",
    "a re - examination of the previous data obtained in the years 1982 to 1986 ( breger 2002 , hereafter referred to as paper ii ) led to the discovery of ten frequencies in the 1986 dsn data .",
    "nine of these frequencies are also present in the list of twelve frequencies determined during a remarkable study of @xmath0 tau from space ( poretti et al .",
    "2002 , hereafter referred to as paper iii ) : during 2000 august , @xmath0 tau was monitored extensively with the star tracker camera on the wide - field infrared explorer satellite ( wire ) .",
    "@xmath0  tau is a 140.728d binary system with known orbital elements ( ebbighausen 1959 , torres , stefanik & latham 1997 ) .",
    "the two components have similar temperatures .",
    "the primary component is evolved ( a7iii ) , while the secondary is fainter by 1.10 mag ( peterson , stefanik & latham 1993 ) and still on the main sequence .",
    "both stars are situated inside the instability strip .",
    "it was shown in paper i that the dominant pulsation modes originate in the primary component because the predicted orbital light - time effects for the primary match the observed shifts in the light curves of up to several minutes .",
    "this confirms an expectation from the values of the frequencies ( 10  15  cd@xmath1 ) , which are incompatible with those of main - sequence @xmath11  scuti stars .",

    "november and december , @xmath0 tau was measured photometrically with the three - star - technique ( breger 1993 ) at a number of observatories spaced around the globe .",
    "weather conditions , unfortunately , were unfavorable so that data from a number of asian observatories were not accurate enough to be included in the present analysis .",
    "152 hours of photometry at four other observatories could be used .",
    "these observatories were :    \\(i ) lowell : the photoelectric photometer attached to the 0.8 m reflector at lowell observatory , flagstaff , usa , was used with the strmgren @xmath13 and @xmath14 filters together with a neutral density filter .",
    "the observer was w. zima .",
    "\\(ii ) mcdonald observatory : the 0.9 m telescope was used with the @xmath14 filter .",
    "the observer was g. handler .",
    "\\(iii ) sierra nevada observatory : the 0.9 m telescope was used together with @xmath13 and @xmath14 filters .",
    "the observers were r. garrido and f. beichbuchner .",
    "\\(iv ) the 0.6 m reflector at the xinglong station of beijing astronomical observatory , china , was used for 9 nights with the @xmath15 filter .",
    "the observers were li zhiping , zhou aiying , and yang dawei .",
    "more details can be found in li et al .",
    "( 1997a ) , where the chinese data have already been published , and li et al .",
    "( 1997b ) .",
    "we have adopted the chinese data as published except for the slight editing of a few ( obviously ) deviant points .",
    "a journal of the photoelectric measurements used is given in table 1 .",
    "the curves drawn represent the 13-frequency fit found in a later section.,width=325 ]     tau.,width=325 ]    all observatories used the same two comparison stars as during the previous dsn campaigns of @xmath0 tau , viz . ,",
    "hr  1422 and hr  1428 .",
    "no evidence for any variability of these comparison stars was found .",
    "we could combine the @xmath15 and @xmath14 data , because the @xmath14 magnitudes are defined to be equal to the @xmath15 magnitudes .",
    "after the standard photometric reductions relative to the two comparison stars , the data from the different observatories needed to be combined . for the initial multifrequency analyses ,",
    "this was done by subtracting the average relative magnitude of @xmath0 tau at each observatory and then combining the data . since the multifrequency analyses utilized the fitting of sine curves to the data , the zero - points",
    "could then be further adjusted from the values of zero - point of these fits .",
    "the times of observation were converted to heliocentric julian date ( hjd ) .",
    "we also calculated the light time corrections for the orbital motion of the primary stellar component ( see fig .",
    "6 of paper i ) . during this short campaign of 25d",
    ", the light time correction is very small and practically constant .",
    "therefore , we have not applied such a correction to the present data .",
    "the extinction coefficients were derived separately for each night by using the two comparison stars .",
    "for a few short data sets , average extinction coefficients had to be applied .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show the observed light variations of @xmath0 tau together with the 13-frequency fit derived in later sections .",
    "the new data will be made available in the communications in asteroseismology .",
    "the pulsation frequency analyses were performed with a package of computer programs with single - frequency and multiple - frequency techniques ( period98 , sperl 1998 ) .",
    "these programs utilize fourier as well as multiple - least - squares algorithms .",
    "the latter technique fits a number of simultaneous sinusoidal variations to the observed light variability and does not rely on prewhitening . for the purposes of presentation and initial searches , however , prewhitening is required if the low - amplitude modes are to be seen .",
    "therefore , in the presentation of the results ( see below ) , the various power spectra are presented as a series of panels , each with additional frequencies removed relative to the panel above .",
    "two observatories also provided measurements in a second filter , viz . , the strmgren @xmath13 filter . in this filter ,",
    "the amplitudes of @xmath0  tau are higher by about 30% relative those in the @xmath14 filter . in power spectra ,",
    "the location of the peaks in frequency are not affected by mixing data with different amplitudes .",
    "consequently , for the power spectra we have used the data from all filters .",
    "the slight phase shift up to 10@xmath16 in the light curves of @xmath11  scuti stars between the different filters was ignored , since numerical simulations show that for @xmath11  scuti stars the power spectra are not affected by such small shifts .",
    "however , for prewhitening , the data from the two filters had to be treated separately .",
    "the multiperiodic fitting of sinusoids to the data relies on the minimization of the residuals between the fit and the observations and requires correct amplitudes .",
    "this problem was solved by computing separate solutions for the two colors , which could then be prewhitened .",
    "one of the most important questions in the examination of multiperiodicity concerns the decision as to which of the detected peaks in the power spectrum can be regarded as variability intrinsic to the star . due to the presence of nonrandom errors in photometric observations and because of observing gaps",
    ", the predictions of standard statistical false - alarm tests give answers which are considered by us to be overly optimistic . in a previous paper ( breger et al .",
    "1993 ) we have argued that a ratio of amplitude signal / noise = 4.0 provides a useful criterion for judging the reality of a peak .",
    "this corresponds to a power signal / noise ratio of 12.6 .",
    "subsequent analyses comparing independent data sets have confirmed that this criterion is an excellent predictor of intrinsic vs. possible noise peaks , as long as it is not applied to very small data sets or at low frequencies , where the errors of measurement are far from random . in the present study ,",
    "the noise was calculated by averaging the amplitudes ( oversampled by a factor of 20 ) over 5  cd@xmath1 regions centered around the frequency under consideration .",
    "the top panel shows the spectral window , while the other panels present the power spectra before and after prewhitening a given number of frequencies .",
    "see text for a discussion of significance levels.,width=325 ]    the spectral window of the 1994 data ( fig .  3 ) is quite clean because the data were collected on three continents , thereby avoiding serious regular day - time observing gaps .",
    "nevertheless , the 1  cd@xmath1 aliasing should still be kept in mind , since modes with very small amplitudes might hide in the alias peaks .",
    "the power spectrum of @xmath0 tau was computed from frequency values of zero to the nyquist frequency .",
    "the highest power levels were found in the 10 to 16  cd@xmath1 region .",
    "an additional band of power was found in the 26 to 30  cd@xmath1 region and will be examined in a later section .",
    "the power spectra in the 8 to 16  cd@xmath1 region are presented in fig .",
    "the second panel from the top shows the dominant three frequencies , which have been found in all other photometric campaigns as well .",
    "the next panel shows the power spectrum after prewhitening of the main three frequencies .",
    "three additional peaks are detected without any problems .",
    "the power spectrum of the data after prewhitening six frequencies ( data - 6f ) presents a small problem : the dominant peak may be double .",
    "the peak at 11.770  cd@xmath1 , called f@xmath17 , is strong and its frequency easily determined .",
    "removal of this mode leaves another peak at 11.730  cd@xmath1 at a lower amplitude .",
    "the frequency separation of 0.04  cd@xmath1 is at the limit of frequency resolution of the present data set .",
    "this prevents us from applying the powerful phasing ",
    "amplitude test to distinguish between two independent close frequencies and the artifacts caused by a single frequency with variable amplitudes ( see breger & bischof 2002 ) .",
    "fortunately , it is not necessary here to prove the existence of a frequency doublet : both frequencies have been seen before in the wire data ( paper iii ) , while the weaker component in the 1994 data was already detected in the 1986 data ( paper ii ) .",
    "we therefore accept the reality of the two close frequencies , f@xmath17 and f@xmath18 .",
    "three additional frequencies are found in the 1994 data .",
    "further peaks are below the statistical threshold ( bottom panel of fig .  3 ) .    the adopted frequencies and amplitudes are shown in table  2 .",
    "the uncertainties in amplitude were calculated from the standard formulae given in breger et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , based on the assumption of random observational errors and no aliasing .",
    "the uncertainties of the amplitudes of f@xmath17 and f@xmath18 are larger because these two modes are very close in frequency . because the separation of two frequencies is at the resolution limit of the present data set , the computed size of the amplitude of one mode is somewhat affected by the presence of the other mode ( the so - called pumping effect ) .",
    "these amplitudes are therefore marked with a colon .",

    "the mode may be present in the 1986 data , because in the power spectrum a small peak at an amplitude level of @xmath26 0.5 mmag is seen at that frequency value , but below the level of significance .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that the slight 1  cd@xmath1 aliasing still present in the multisite ground - based campaign data is not responsible for the computed small ( or zero ) amplitudes in 1986 and 1994 .",

    "the influence of rotation on the evolutionary tracks of @xmath11  scuti models was demonstrated by breger & pamyatnykh ( 1998 ) and pamyatnykh ( 2000 ) . in most cases the initial equatorial rotational velocity on the zams",
    "was chosen to be 100 km / s .",

    "1998 ) .    the main aim of the present theoretical study was to check the instability of models of both stellar components of @xmath0 tau for the whole range of allowed values of mass or gravity , effective temperature and luminosity and to outline possible asteroseismological constraints to the models .",
    "we did not attempt to construct any model which fits quantitatively the observed and the theoretical frequency spectra of excited multiperiodic oscillations .    as a first step",
    ", we tried to fit the observed and theoretical frequency ranges of the unstable modes .",
    "the main uncertainty of such a study is the unsatisfactory description of convection in the stellar envelope and its interaction with pulsations .",
    "the fact that convection may influence the instability of stars not only near the red edge but almost in the whole classical instability strip was discussed by stellingwerf ( 1984 ) in connection with the problem of the determination of helium abundance in globular clusters from the temperature at the blue edge of the rr lyrae instability domain .",
    "@xmath11 scuti stars are generally hotter than rr lyrae stars , but even in this part of the instability strip convection influences the onset of the instability for low overtones of radial and nonradial oscillations .",
    "9 of pamyatnykh ( 2000 ) demonstrates that convection significantly displaces the radial fundamental blue edge to hotter temperatures due to increased driving in the hydrogen ionization zone which is more extended than in the radiative models .",
    "a part of this contribution to the driving may also be caused by the generally - used assumption that the convective flux does not vary during an oscillation cycle .",
    "this simple assumption is probably incorrect in the hydrogen convection zone .",
    "therefore , the reality of the additional convective destabilization in the outer hydrogen zone must be examined by using a nonlocal time - dependent treatment of convection .",
    "first promising results in this direction ( see michel et al . 1999 , houdek 2000 ) exist .",
    "note that the total driving in a @xmath11  scuti star ( with main contribution due to the @xmath60 mechanism operating in the second helium ionization zone ) only slightly exceeds the total damping .",
    "therefore even small contributions to the driving are important .    due to these uncertainties",
    "we consider our results as preliminary and our models as test models .",

    "the luminosities of the higher and the lower - mass models approximately correspond to the luminosity of the primary and secondary stellar components , respectively .    for the primary component",
    ", we have chosen models at the beginning of the post - main - sequence ( hereafter called post - ms ) expansion stage , which burn hydrogen in a thick shell just after full hydrogen exhaustion in the stellar core .",
    "this evolutionary stage of the primary was proposed earlier by krlikowska ( 1992 ) for a significantly hotter model of about 8200 k without overshooting .",
    "moreover , we studied slightly more massive models of similar effective temperature and luminosity in the ms stage as well as post - ms models without overshooting .",

    "( rotation does not affect our theoretical results significantly , but it may influence the photometric calibrations . ) the total number of unstable modes of @xmath85 is equal to 37 in the ms model p1 , 77 and 56 in the post - ms models p2 and p3 , respectively .",
    "note that the post - ms evolution of models for the primary is much faster than the ms evolution of the less massive secondary .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "5 all models of 2.45 @xmath70 with @xmath86k , 7900k and 7800k ( the last model is just model p3 ) have the same age 695 myr .",
    "these models correspond to stars which are slightly older than the hyades ( 650 myr , lebreton et al .",
    "on the other hand , the models without overshooting may correspond to stars younger than the hyades : the age of 2.50 @xmath70 models is 595 myr . the best model for the primary may therefore be one with slightly weaker overshooting than that of model p3 .    the inferred age of the secondary star",
    "can be adjusted to the age of the primary as well as to that of the hyades cluster .",
    "this is possible because of the slower main - sequence evolution of the secondary and due to the fact that corresponding models of different effective temperatures fit the observed frequencies quite well . as an example ,",
    "models of 2.10 @xmath70 with @xmath86k , 7900k and 7800k have the ages 625 , 667 and 704 myr .    moreover , we tested some models of different chemical composition . if we choose the estimated values for the helium content ( lebreton et al .",
    "2001 ) and metallicity ( lastennet et al . 1999 ) , the chemical compositions become @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",

    "models with @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath50 are somewhat more luminous for a given mass , e.  g. , the track of 2.45  @xmath70 almost coincides with the track of 2.55 @xmath70 computed with @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 . the models are also pulsationally more unstable and the range of unstable modes is somewhat wider due to higher helium abundance . as a consequence",
    ", the ms model of 2.45 @xmath70 with @xmath87k can be unstable in the observed frequency range and also at slightly higher frequencies .",
    "the luminosity of this model , @xmath88 , agrees with the estimates from the orbital and dynamical parallaxes .",
    "the dsn campaign  12 , carried out during 1994 at four observatories , resulted in 152 hours of high - precision photometry . 13 frequencies of pulsation",
    "were derived from the data .",
    "these frequencies confirm the results from previous earth - based ( 19821986 ) as well as satellite ( 2000 ) photometry , although amplitude variability on a time scale of several years is present .",
    "while the detected modes in the 1015 cd@xmath1 range probably all originate in the primary , the higher frequencies with small amplitudes probably originate in the @xmath11  scuti - type of variability of the main - sequence companion .",
    "we constructed evolutionary models both for the primary and the secondary components and tested them for the instability against radial and nonradial oscillations .",
    "the best fit of the theoretical and observed frequency ranges is achieved for models with @xmath5k or slightly higher , in agreement with photometric calibrations .",
    "the instability spans two or three radial orders from @xmath6 to @xmath7 for radial modes . post - ms models with or without overshooting are preferable for the primary , but ms models with overshooting are also possible .",
    "for the less luminous secondary component the instability range is wider and spans 5 to 7 radial orders from @xmath8 to @xmath9 .",
    "models of different effective temperature are unstable at observed frequencies 26.184 and 26.732  cd@xmath1 which lie around radial modes @xmath10 to @xmath7 .",
    "the main uncertainties of the results are caused by our crude treatment of the convective flux .",
    "we neglected the lagrangian variation of the convective flux during an oscillation cycle .",
    "this assumption is not fulfilled in the hydrogen convective zone , which may lead to an incorrect estimate of the small contribution of this zone to the driving .",
    "to prove the results quantitatively , it is necessary to use a reliable theory of non - local time - dependent convection .",
    "we note also the nonlocal results by kupka & montgomery ( 2002 ) , who point out the necessity to use very different values of the mixing - length parameter in the hydrogen and helium convection zones , if we still use local mixing - length theory . according to nonlocal studies of a - star envelopes , it is necessary to use a small value of this parameter in the hydrogen zone and a significantly higher value in the deeper helium zone .",
    "we plan to perform corresponding tests for the @xmath0 tau models .",
    "however , even with the present calculations and results we probably can exclude modes involving the second radial overtone ( mode @xmath89 ) and lower - order modes , as well as all hot models of the primary with @xmath4k .",
    "the reason is that all these models are stable in the observed frequency range of 10.8 to 14.6  cd@xmath1 .",
