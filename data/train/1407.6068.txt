    "spectroscopic surveys of galaxies  e.g.  the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; @xcite ) , 6-degree field galaxy survey ( 6dfgs ; @xcite ) , sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) and galaxy and mass assembly ( gama ;",
    "@xcite ) survey  are immensely powerful tools for investigating galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "optical spectroscopy provides measurements of properties such as the star formation rate ( sfr ) , stellar ages , metallicity of gas and stars , and dust extinction .",
    "emission from other processes such as active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and shock - heated gas is also measured .",
    "multi - object spectrographs have allowed us to collate these properties for large samples of galaxies and search for correlations that illuminate the underlying physics of galaxy evolution , as well as find outliers that can be used to test models under the most extreme conditions .",
    "surveys of this type have shed new light on the role of environment in star formation ( e.g.  @xcite ) , the relationship between supermassive black holes and their host galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite ) , the mass  metallicity  sfr relation ( e.g.  @xcite ) and many other aspects of extragalactic astrophysics .",
    "notwithstanding the great achievements of traditional spectroscopic surveys , the use of a single fibre or slit to observe each galaxy limits the available information .",
    "a clear example of this limitation is that an sfr measured from a single spectrum must be aperture corrected to recover the global sfr , introducing an extra uncertainty @xcite . in many cases ,",
    "the exact location of the fibre or slit within the galaxy is not known , increasing the uncertainty from aperture effects .",
    "more critically , single - fibre observations can only provide a single measurement of any property for the entire galaxy , and so are inherently unable to probe spatial variations in sfr , ionisation state , stellar populations or any other parameter .",
    "similarly , they can not provide any information about the internal kinematics of the galaxy other than an integrated velocity dispersion .",
    "these limitations are addressed by the use of spatially - resolved spectroscopy , based on integral field units ( ifus ) .",
    "measuring the spatially resolved properties of galaxies has opened up a new direction in the study of galaxy evolution : studies of turbulent star - forming discs @xcite , galactic winds from agn and star formation @xcite , the environmental dependence of stellar kinematics @xcite and star formation distributions @xcite , and age and metallicity gradients in stellar populations @xcite provide only a small sample of the contributions of integral field spectroscopy .    until now",
    ", technical limitations have meant that almost all ifu instruments have been monolithic , viewing a single galaxy at a time . as a result ,",
    "observing large numbers of galaxies has been difficult and time - consuming .",
    "the largest samples of ifu observations available to date have been the atlas-3d survey , with 260 galaxies @xcite , and the ongoing calar alto legacy integral field area ( califa ) survey , with a target of 600 galaxies @xcite .",
    "surveys of this size are already breaking new ground in our understanding of galaxy evolution , but with monolithic ifus they can not be scaled up much further .",
    "the next step forward for integral field spectroscopic surveys is to use multiplexed ifus capable of observing multiple galaxies simultaneously .",
    "the first such instrument , the fibre large array multi element spectrograph ( flames ; @xcite ) on the 8-m very large telescope ( vlt ) has 15 deployable ifus with 20 spaxels ( spatial elements ) each and @xmath2 fields of view . despite the small number of spaxels in each ifu , flames",
    "has demonstrated the power of multiplexed ifu systems , for example showing the increased kinematic complexity of galaxies at medium redshift ( @xmath3 ; @xcite ) .",
    "for studies at low redshift ( @xmath4 ) , ifus with larger fields of view are required to probe the full extent of each galaxy .",
    "the sydney ",
    "aao multi - object integral field spectrograph ( sami ; @xcite ) on the 3.9-m anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) is the first instrument with this capability , having 13 ifus each with a field of view of @xmath515 .",
    "sami makes use of hexabundles , bundles of 61 fibres that are fused together and have a high optical performance and @xmath075 per cent filling factor @xcite .",
    "the fibres feed into the existing aaomega spectrograph @xcite , a double - beamed spectrograph that offers a range of configurations suitable for galaxy spectroscopy .",
    "since its commissioning in 2012 , sami observations have been used for studies of galactic winds @xcite , the kinematic morphology  density relation @xcite and star formation in dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "the sami galaxy survey is an ongoing survey to observe @xmath03400 galaxies covering a wide range of stellar masses , redshifts , and environmental densities .",
    "the science goals of the survey are broad , with key themes being the dependence of galaxy evolution on environment , and the build - up of galaxy mass and angular momentum .",
    "observations began in march 2013 and are scheduled to continue until mid-2016 .",
    "we present here the early data release ( edr ) of the sami galaxy survey , containing fully calibrated datacubes and associated catalogue information for 107 galaxies selected from the full sample . the edr sample is described in , and a brief overview of the sami data reduction process is given in .",
    "we provide instructions for accessing and using the edr data in .",
    "presents a thorough analysis of the results from the sami data reduction pipeline , including key metrics that quantify its current performance .",
    "finally , we summarise our findings in .",
    "the targets for the sami galaxy survey are drawn from the gama survey g09 , g12 and g15 fields , as well as a set of eight galaxy clusters that extend the survey to higher environmental densities .",
    "all candidates have known redshifts from gama , sdss or dedicated 2df observations , allowing us to create a tiered set of volume - limited samples .",
    "full details of the target selection are presented in @xcite .",
    "the 107 galaxies that form the sami galaxy survey edr are those contained in nine fields in the gama regions that were observed in march and april 2013 .",
    "each field contains 12 galaxies .",
    "one galaxy  gama i d",
    "373248  was observed in two separate fields . for this galaxy",
    "the edr contains only the data from the field in which the atmospheric seeing at the time of observation was better ( 12 rather than 22 ) .",
    "the full list of galaxies included in the edr is given in in the appendix , which contains detailed information about each galaxy .",
    "we manually selected the fields in the edr to provide a representative subsample of the gama regions of the full sami galaxy survey , covering the range of redshifts , stellar masses and galaxy morphologies as completely as possible .",
    "the stellar masses @xcite and redshifts @xcite of the edr sample are shown in the context of the full survey in , which also illustrates the survey s selection criteria . the edr sample does not contain any galaxies from the high - redshift filler targets , or from the targets with the lowest mass and redshift , resulting in slightly reduced ranges relative to the full sample : @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "although no cut was made on the apparent size of the sami galaxy survey targets , the mass and redshift criteria were chosen with the field of view and fibre size of the sami instrument in mind .",
    "most of the galaxies in both the edr and the full survey are small enough that the field of view reaches at least one effective radius ( @xmath8 ) , and large enough that sami can resolve their light across a number of fibres .",
    "shows the distribution of @xmath9-band major - axis @xmath8 , drawn from the gama analysis of sdss imaging @xcite , for the galaxies in the edr .",
    "the median @xmath8 is 439 , with 17 of the 107 having @xmath8 greater than the radius of the sami hexabundles ( 75 ) .",
