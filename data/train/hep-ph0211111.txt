    "despite the accumulating knowledges of neutrino masses and the lepton flavor mixing by the atmospheric @xcite , the solar @xcite , and the accelerator @xcite neutrino experiments , the ( 1 - 3 ) sector of the maki - nakagawa - sakata ( mns ) matrix @xcite is still in the dark . at the moment , we only know that @xmath4 is small , @xmath5 , by the bound imposed by the chooz reactor experiment @xcite . in this paper",
    "we assume that the light neutrino sector consists of three active neutrinos only .",
    "one of the challenging goals in an attempt to explore the full structure of lepton flavor mixing would be measuring the leptonic cp or t violating phase @xmath6 in the mns matrix .",
    "if kamland @xcite confirms the large - mixing - angle ( lma ) mikheev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) @xcite solution of the solar neutrino problem , the most favored one by the recent analyses of solar neutrino data @xcite , we will have an open route toward the goal .",
    "yet , there might still exist the last impasse , namely the possibility of too small value of @xmath7 .",
    "thus , it is recently emphasized more and more strongly that the crucial next step toward the goal would be the determination of @xmath7 .    in this paper",
    ", we raise the possibility that @xmath8 disappearance experiment using reactor neutrinos could be potentially the fastest ( and the cheapest ) way to detect the effects of nonzero @xmath7 .",
    "in fact , such an experiment using the krasnoyarsk reactor complex has been described earlier @xcite , in which the sensitivity to @xmath9 can be as low as @xmath10 , an order of magnitude lower than the chooz experiment .",
    "we will also briefly outline basic features of our proposal , and reexamine the sensitivity to @xmath9 in this paper .",
    "it appears that the most popular way of measuring @xmath7 is the next generation long baseline ( lbl ) neutrino oscillation experiments , minos @xcite , opera @xcite , and the jhf phase i @xcite .",
    "it may be followed either by conventional superbeam @xcite experiments , the jhf phase ii @xcite and possibly others @xcite , or by neutrino factories @xcite .",
    "it is pointed out , however , that the measurement of @xmath7 in lbl experiments with only neutrino channel ( as planned in the jhf phase i ) would suffer from large intrinsic uncertainties , on top of the experimental errors , due to the dependence on an unknown cp phase and the sign of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is noticed that the ambiguity remains in determination of @xmath7 and other parameters even if precise measurements of appearance probabilities in neutrino as well as antineutrino channels are carried out , the problem of the parameter degeneracy @xcite .",
    "( for a global overview of the parameter degeneracy , see @xcite . )",
    "while some ideas toward a solution are proposed the problem is hard to solve experimentally and it is not likely to be resolved in the near future .",
    "we emphasize in this paper that reactor @xmath8 disappearance experiment provide particularly clean environment for the measurement of @xmath7 .",
    "namely , it can be regarded as a dedicated experiment for determination of @xmath7 ; it is insensitive to the ambiguity due to all the remaining oscillation parameters as well as to the matter effect .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the features of lbl experiments described above .",
    "thus , the reactor measurement of @xmath7 will provide us valuable information complementary to the one from lbl experiments and will play an important role in resolving the problem of the parameter degeneracy .",
    "it will be shown that reducing the systematic errors is crucial for the reactor measurement of @xmath7 to be competitive in accuracy with lbl experiments .",
    "we will present a preliminary analysis of its possible roles in this context .",
    "it is then natural to think about the possibility that one has better control by combining the two complementary way of measuring @xmath7 , the reactor and the accelerator methods .",
    "in fact , we will show in this paper that nontrivial relations exist between the @xmath7 measurements by both methods thanks to the complementary nature of these two methods , so that in the luckiest case one may be able to derive constraints on the value of the cp violating phase @xmath6 , or to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "let us examine in this section how clean the measurement of @xmath7 by the reactor experiments is . to define our notations",
    ", we note that the standard notation @xcite , @xmath12 , \\label{mnsmatrix}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is used for the mns matrix throughout this paper where @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) imply @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "the mass squared difference of neutrinos is defined as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the mass of the @xmath20th eigenstate .",
    "we examine possible `` contamination '' by @xmath6 , the matter effect , the sign of @xmath11 , and the solar parameters one by one .",
    "we first note that , due to its low neutrino energy of a few mev , the reactor experiments are inherently disappearance experiments , which can measure only the survival probability @xmath21 .",
    "it is well known that the survival probability does not depend on the cp phase @xmath6 in arbitrary matter densities @xcite .    in any reactor experiment on the earth ,",
    "short or long baseline , the matter effect is very small because the energy is quite low and can be ignored to a good approximation .",
    "it can be seen by comparing the matter and the vacuum effects ( as the matter correction comes in only through this combination in the approximate formula in @xcite ) @xmath22 where @xmath23 with @xmath24 being the neutrino energy and @xmath25 baseline length .",
    "the best fit value of @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 from the super - kamiokande atmospheric neutrino data @xcite , and we use this as the reference value for @xmath26 throughout this paper .",
    "@xmath28 denotes the index of refraction in matter with @xmath29 being the fermi constant and @xmath30 the electron number density in the earth which is related to the earth matter density @xmath31 as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is proton fraction .",
    "once we know that the matter effect is negligible we immediately recognize that the survival probability is independent of the sign of @xmath11",
    ".    therefore , the vacuum probability formula applies . the general probability formula in vacuum is analytically written as @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 , and the minus and signs in front of the @xmath36 term in ( [ pgeneral ] ) correspond to neutrino and antineutrino channels , respectively . from ( [ pgeneral ] ) the exact expression for @xmath21 is given by @xmath37 where the parametrization ( [ mnsmatrix ] ) has been used in the second line .",
    "the three terms in the second line of ( [ pvac ] ) are suppressed relative to the main depletion term , the first term of the right - hand - side of ( [ pvac ] ) , by @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , respectively , where @xmath41 . assuming that @xmath42 @xcite , @xmath43 for the lma msw solar neutrino solution @xcite .",
    "then , the first and the third terms in the second line can be ignored , although the second term can be of order unity compared with the main depletion term provided that @xmath44 .",
    "( notice that we are considering the measurement of @xmath45 in the range of 0.1 - 0.01 . ) therefore , assuming that @xmath26 is determined by lbl experiments with good accuracy , the reactor @xmath46 disappearance experiment gives us a clean measurement of @xmath7 which is independent of any solar parameters except for the case of high @xmath47 lma solutions .",
    "if the high @xmath47 lma solution with @xmath48 turns out to be the right one , we need a special care for the second term of the second line of ( [ pvac ] ) . in this case , the determination of @xmath7 and the solar angle @xmath49 is inherently coupled , for measurement of @xmath49 at kamland is discussed in @xcite . ] and we would need joint analysis of near - far detector complex ( see the next section ) and kamland .",
    "in order to obtain good sensitivity to @xmath45 , selection of an optimized baseline and having the small statistical and systematic errors are crucial .",
    "for instance , the baseline length that gives the oscillation maximum for reactor @xmath46 s which have typical energy is for @xmath50 .",
    "along with this baseline selection , if systematic and statistical errors can be reduced to level , which is 2.8 times better than the chooz experiment @xcite , an order of magnitude improvement for the @xmath45 sensitivity is possible at @xmath50 . in this section",
    "we demonstrate that such kind of experiment is potentially possible if we place a chooz - like detector at a baseline in underground near a reactor of @xmath51 thermal power .",
    "the reactor can be regarded as a simplified one of the kashiwazaki - kariwa nuclear power plant which consists of seven reactors and whose maximum energy generation is @xmath51 .",
    "major part of systematic errors is caused by uncertainties of the neutrino flux calculation , number of protons , and the detection efficiency .",
    "for instance , in the chooz experiment , the uncertainty of the neutrino flux is , that of number of protons is , and that of detection efficiency as is shown in the table [ table ] .",
    "the uncertainty of the neutrino flux includes ambiguities of the reactor thermal power generation , the reactor fuel component , the neutrino spectra from fissions , and so on .",
    "the uncertainty of the detection efficiency includes systematic shift of defining the fiducial volume .",
    "these systematic uncertainties , however , cancel out if identical detectors are placed near and far from the reactors and data taken at the detectors are compared .    to estimate how good the cancellation will be , we study the case of the bugey experiment , which uses three identical detectors to detect reactor neutrinos at . for the bugey case ,",
    "the uncertainty of the neutrino flux improved from to and the error on the solid angle remained the same ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "if each ratio of the improvement for the bugey case is directly applicable to our case , the systematic uncertainty will improve from to as shown in the table [ table ] .",
    "the ambiguity of the solid angle will be negligibly small because the absolute baseline is much longer than the bugey case .",
    "we are thinking of a case that a front detector is located at away from the reactor we consider . in the actual",
    "setting with the kashiwazaki - kariwa power plant two near detectors may be necessary due to extended array of seven reactors .",
    "hereafter , we take and as the reference values of the relative systematic error @xmath53 for the total number of @xmath46 events in our analysis .",
    "let us examine the physics potential of such a reactor experiment assuming these reference values for the systematic error .",
    "we take , for concreteness , the kashiwazaki - kariwa reactor of @xmath51 thermal power and assume its operation with efficiency .",
    "two identical liquid scintillation detectors are located at and away from the reactor and assumed to detect @xmath46 by delayed coincidence with detection efficiency .",
    "the @xmath46 s of visible energy , @xmath54 , are used and the number of events are counted in 14 bins of . without oscillation , a measurement at the far detector yields 20,000 ( 80,000 ) @xmath46 events which is naively comparable to a statistical error .",
    "first , let us calculate how much we could constrain @xmath9 . unlike the analysis in @xcite which uses the ratio of the numbers of events at the near and the far detectors , we use the difference of the numbers of events @xmath55 , because the statistical analysis with ratios is complicated .",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite . )",
    "the definition of @xmath56 , which stands for the deviation from the best fit point ( non - oscillation point ) is given by @xmath57 -\\left[n_i(l_2 ) -",

    "both the systematic errors @xmath61 ( absolute normalization ) and @xmath59 ( relative normalization ) appear in the denominator of ( [ chi2 ] ) , but by taking the difference , we have @xmath62 -[n_i(l_2)-(l_1/l_2)^2n_i(l_1)]=\\sigma_{\\text{sys}}^{\\text{bin } } n_i(l_2 ) + \\sigma_{\\text{abs.sys}}^{\\text{bin } } [ n_i(l_2)-(l_1/l_2)^2n_i(l_1)]$ ] which indicates that the systematic error is dominated by the relative error @xmath59 , as the second term @xmath63 $ ] is supposed to be small .",
    "in fact we have explicitly verified numerically that the presence of @xmath64 ^ 2 $ ] in the denominator of ( [ chi2 ] ) does not affect any result . from the assumption that the relative systematic error for each bin is distributed equally into bins , @xmath59 is estimated from the relative systematic error @xmath53 for the total number of events by @xmath65 since the uncertainty squared of the total number of events is obtained by adding up the bin - by - bin systematic errors @xmath66 ; the ratio @xmath67 is about 3 in our analysis . in fig .",

    "we show that the reactor measurement of @xmath7 can resolve the degeneracy at least partly if the measurement is sufficiently accurate . toward the goal we first explain what is the problem of the parameter degeneracy in long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "it is a notorious problem ; a set of measurements of the @xmath87 disappearance probability and the appearance oscillation probabilities of @xmath88 and @xmath89 , no matter how accurate they may be , does not allow unique determination of @xmath7 , @xmath6 , and @xmath2 .",

    "it was noticed that the degeneracy is further duplicated provided that the two neutrino mass patterns , the normal ( @xmath93 ) and the inverted ( @xmath94 ) hierarchies , are allowed @xcite .",
    "finally , it was pointed out that the degeneracy can be maximally eight - fold @xcite .",
    "analytic structure of the degenerate solutions was worked out in a general setting in @xcite .    to illuminate the point ,",
    "let us first restrict our treatment to a relatively short baseline experiment such as the cern - frejus project @xcite . in this case , one can use the vacuum oscillation approximation for the disappearance and the appearance probabilities . from the general formula ( [ pgeneral ] ) we have @xmath95 @xmath96 where @xmath41 , @xmath97 , and the parametrization ( [ mnsmatrix ] ) has been used in the second line in each formula .",
    "the minus and plus signs in front of @xmath98 term in ( [ p_mue ] ) correspond to neutrino and antineutrino channels , respectively .",

    "maximal mixing , it still leaves a rather wide range of @xmath2 , despite such fantastic accuracy of the measurement .",
    "accuracy in @xmath106 implies about uncertainty in @xmath105 .",
    "thus , whenever we try to determine @xmath45 from the appearance measurement , we have to face the ambiguity due to the two - fold nature of the solution for @xmath105 .",
    "let us discuss the simplest possible case , the low or the vacuum ( vac ) oscillation solution of the solar neutrino problem .",
    "( see e.g. , @xcite for a recent discussion . ) in this case , one can safely ignore terms of order @xmath38 in ( [ p_mumu ] ) and ( [ p_mue ] )",
    ". then we are left with only the first terms in the right - hand - side of these equations , the one - mass scale dominant vacuum oscillation probabilities .",
    "now let us define the symbols @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "then , ( [ p_mumu ] ) and ( [ p_mue ] ) take the forms @xmath109 or @xmath110 ( corresponding to two solutions of @xmath105 ) and @xmath111 , respectively , for given values of the probabilities .",
    "it is then obvious that there are two crossing points of these curves .",
    "this is the simplest version of the ( @xmath112 ) degeneracy problem .",
    "we next discuss what happens if @xmath38 is not negligible though small : the case of lma solar neutrino solution . in this case , the appearance curve , @xmath111 , split into two curves ( though they are in fact connected at their maximum value of @xmath105 ) because of the two degenerate solution of the set ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) that is allowed for a given set of values of @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "then , we have , in general , four crossing points on the plane for a given value of @xmath100 , the four - fold degeneracy .",
    "simultaneously , the two @xmath116 lines are slightly tilted and the splitting between two curves becomes larger at larger @xmath45 , though the effect is too tiny to be clearly seen .",
    "if the baseline distance is longer , the earth matter effect comes in and further splits each appearance contour into two , depending upon the sign of @xmath11 .",
    "then , we have four curves ( or , two continuous contours each of which intersects with @xmath117 line twice ) and hence there are eight solutions as displayed in fig .",
    "[ degen1 ] .",

    "the qualitative features of the figure remain unchanged even if we employ values of the parameters obtained by other analyses .",
    "now we discuss how reactor experiments can contribute to resolve the parameter degeneracy . to make our discussion as concrete as possible we use the particular long - baseline experiment , the jhf experiment @xcite , to illuminate the complementary role played by reactor and long - baseline experiments .",
    "it is likely that the experiment will be carried out at around the first oscillation maximum ( @xmath123 ) for a number of reasons : the dip in energy spectrum in disappearance channel is the deepest , the number of appearance events are nearly maximal @xcite , and the two - fold degeneracy in @xmath6 becomes simple ( @xmath124 ) for each mass hierarchy @xcite .",

    "section lbl experiments at the oscillation maximum and @xmath159 are assumed .",
    "if a reactor experiment sees an affirmative evidence for the disappearance in @xmath160 ( the case of reactor affirmative ) , it would be possible to determine @xmath7 up to certain experimental errors . in this case , the appearance probability in lbl experiment must fall into the region @xmath161 if the mass hierarchy is known , where the @xmath162 sign refers to @xmath163 ( @xmath164 ) and max ( min ) refers to the maximum ( minimum ) value of the allowed region for @xmath165 , respectively .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ envelope ] . ) without the knowledge of the mass hierarchy the probability is within the region @xmath166 .",
    "the similar inequalities are present also for antineutrino appearance channel . in fig .",
    "[ envelope ] we present allowed regions in the cases of @xmath163 and @xmath164 on a plane spanned by @xmath114 and @xmath115 by taking two best fit values @xmath167 ( labeled as a , b ) as reactor affirmative cases .",
    "they are inside the sensitivity region of the reactor experiment discussed in section iii .",
    "we have used the one dimensional @xmath168 analysis ( i.e. , the only parameter is @xmath0 ) to obtain the allowed regions in fig .",
    "[ envelope ] . in doing this",
    "we have used the same systematic error of @xmath70 and the statistical errors corresponding to measurement by the detector considered in section iii . for @xmath169 ,",
    "the particular reactor experiment would fail ( the case of reactor negative ) but the allowed region can be obtained by the same procedure , and presented in fig .",
    "[ envelope ] , the region labeled as c. we use the same lma parameters as used earlier for fig .",

    "we discuss four cases depending upon the two possibilities of affirmative and negative evidences ( denoted as affirmative , and negative ) in each disappearance and appearance search in reactor and long - baseline accelerator experiments , respectively .",
    "however , it is convenient to organize our discussion by classifying them into two categories , ( reactor affirmative ) , and ( reactor negative ) .",
    "we have two alternative cases , the lbl appearance search affirmative , or negative .",
    "* lbl affirmative * :    implications of affirmative evidence in the appearance search in lbl experiments differ depending upon which region the observed appearance probability @xmath170 falls in :    \\(1 ) @xmath171 , or ( 2 ) @xmath172 :    these cases correspond to the two intervals which are given by the projection on the @xmath128 axis of all the shadowed regions ( a or b ) minus the projection on the @xmath128 axis of the darker shadowed region ( a or b ) in fig .",
    "[ envelope ] .",
    "it is remarkable that in these cases not only the sign of @xmath11 is determined , but also the cp phase @xmath6 is known to be nonvanishing .",
    "if @xmath170 is in the former region then @xmath11 is negative and @xmath173 is positive , whereas if @xmath170 is in the latter then @xmath11 is positive and @xmath173 is negative .",
    "\\(3 ) @xmath174 :    this case corresponds to the interval which is given by the projection on the @xmath128 axis of the darker shadowed region ( a or b ) in fig .  [ envelope ] . in this case , neither the sign of @xmath11 nor the sign of @xmath173 can be determined .",
    "it may be worth noting that if the reactor determination of @xmath7 is accurate enough , it could be advantageous for lbl appearance experiments to run only in the neutrino mode ( where the cross section is larger than that for antineutrinos by a factor of 2 - 3 ) to possibly determine the sign of @xmath11 depending upon which region @xmath170 falls in .",
    "* lbl negative * :    in principle , it is possible to have no appearance event even though the reactor sees evidence for disappearance .",
    "this case corresponds to the left edge of the analogous shadowed region in the case of @xmath175 in fig .",
    "[ envelope ] , i.e. , the allowed region with @xmath175 for which @xmath176 on the @xmath128 axis falls below @xmath177 . in order for this case to occur",
    "the sensitivity limits @xmath178 of the lbl experiment must satisfy @xmath179 assuming our ignorance to the sign of @xmath11 .",
    "if it occurs that @xmath180 , then the sign of @xmath11 is determined to be minus .",
    "@xmath178 of the jhf experiment in its phase i is estimated to be @xmath181 @xcite . quoted in @xcite , @xmath182 ,",

    "we have again two alternative cases , the lbl appearance search affirmative , or negative .",
    "* lbl affirmative * :    if a lbl experiment measures the oscillation probability @xmath170 .",
    "then , for a given value of @xmath170 the allowed region of @xmath186 is given by @xmath187 if the sign of @xmath11 is known , and by @xmath188 otherwise .",
    "we denote below the maximum and the minimum values of @xmath7 collectively as @xmath189 and @xmath190 , respectively . in fig .",

    "\\(ii ) @xmath196 : in this case we have a nontrivial constraint @xmath197 .",
    "* lbl negative * :    in this case , we obtain the upper bound on @xmath7 , which however depends on the assumed values of @xmath6 and the sign of @xmath11 .",
    "a @xmath6-independent bound can also be derived : @xmath198 min[@xmath199 .",
    "in this paper , we have explored in detail the possibility of measuring @xmath0 using reactor neutrinos . we stressed that this measurement is free from the problem of parameter degeneracies from which accelerator appearance experiments suffer , and that the reactor measurement is complementary to accelerator experiments .",
    "we have shown that the sensitivity to @xmath200 ( 0.05 ) is obtained with a @xmath51 reactor with identical detectors at near and far distances and with data size of assuming that the relative systematic error is ( ) for the total number of events .",
    "in particular , if the relative systematic error is , the error in @xmath0 is 0.018 which is smaller than the uncertainty due to the combined ( intrinsic and hierarchical ) parameter degeneracies expected in accelerator experiments .",
    "we also have shown that the reactor measurement can resolve the degeneracy in @xmath201 and determine whether @xmath2 is smaller or larger than @xmath202 if @xmath0 and @xmath3 are relatively large .",
    "we have taken and as the reference values for the relative systematic error for the total number of events .",
    "is exactly the same figure as the bugey experiment while is what we naively expect in the case we have two identical detectors , near and far , which are similar to that of the chooz experiment .",
    "it is also technically possible to dig a depth shaft hole with diameter wide enough to place a chooz - like detector in .",
