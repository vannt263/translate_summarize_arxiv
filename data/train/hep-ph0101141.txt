    "the investigation of inclusive semileptonic @xmath8 decays can provide relevant information on the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( @xmath9 ) parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 as well as on the internal non - perturbative structure of the @xmath8 baryon .",
    "the first evidence of semileptonic @xmath8 decays had been reported by aleph and opal collaborations who had seen an excess of correlated @xmath12 pairs over @xmath13 pairs from @xmath14 decays @xcite , @xcite .",
    "more recently , the cdf collaboration @xcite measured the @xmath8 lifetime using its semileptonic decay mode .",
    "it is therefore important to study theoretical models for the semileptonic @xmath8 decays .",
    "as far as the theoretical point of view is concerned , the @xmath15 -based operator product expansion ( @xmath16 ) combined with the heavy quark expansion is widely recognized as a consistent dynamical approach for investigating inclusive heavy - flavour decays @xcite .",
    "existing theoretical predictions for inclusive weak decays are in reasonable agreement , within the expected range of uncertainty , with the data on decays of charmed and beauty particles .",
    "however , the result of the ope approach for the @xmath8 lifetime is puzzling because it predicts that @xmath17 , whereas the experimental finding suggest a very much reduced fraction @xmath18 .",
    "it is not clear whether the present contradiction between the theory and the data on @xmath19 is a temporary difficulty , or evidence for the fundamental flaws in the ope approach . in spite of great efforts of theoretical activity",
    "the @xmath8 lifetime remains significantly low which continues to spur theoretical activity . in this respect ,",
    "the use of phenomenological models , like the constituent quark model , could be of great interest as a complementary approach to the @xmath16 method .",
    "what criteria should be used in determining an appropriate constituent quark model for the baryons ?",
    "there is now a vast amount of data on the spectrum of baryons .",
    "many quark model calculations of the spectrum attempt to account for the masses , spin etc . , without studying the decays . a serious drawback to this approach",
    "is that it is difficult to assign predicted baryons to experimentally known particles on the basis of spectrum alone . in this sense",
    "this paper is a continuation of the work of kalman and tran @xcite to produce a complete picture of the spectrum and decays of the baryons .",
    "this model is based upon the following principles : i ) consistency with the model of the mass calculation - a change of some feature of the mass calculation in the decay model may compromise the purpose ; ii ) the decay calculation should be mainly determined by the mass calculation . for instance , if there are too many parameters in the decay model it is difficult to relate the results obtained to the particles considered in the model , used in the mass calculation .",
    "the decay calculations were based upon the quark pair creation model of le yaouanc et .",
    "@xcite they studied the decay processes @xmath20 and @xmath21 the pair creation strength @xmath22 is replaced by k@xmath23 . besides the meson radius , these are the only parameters of the model .",
    "the results are in good agreement with the data . to calculate decay widths in their model , kalman and tran had to re - correct the originally calculated parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 by approximately 0.05 gev from the values determined from their spectrum calculation , in order to make the decay widths match experimental data .",
    "the resulting change in @xmath24 and @xmath25 causes a shift in the originally calculated mass spectrum .",
    "it is these values that must be used if the decay widths are to be correct .    at the time that the kalman - tran model was introduced , there was little data available for the b and c sectors .",
    "the model can not fit these sectors properly without the modifications performed in the kalman and dsouza model @xcite .",
    "the essential modification is that the coupling constant of the interaction is made to be scale dependent in a manner that does not require knowledge of the behaviour at low energy scales and does not introduce any new parameter .",
    "the calculations of the inclusive semileptonic widths and the corresponding branching ratios found here introduce no new parameters .",
    "it is based solely upon the eigenfunctions for baryon states found by kalman and dsouza @xcite    in what follows we assume that , instead of qcd with its complicated dynamics of infinite number of degrees of freedom in the light cloud , we consider a constituent bound",
    " state problem of a heavy quark interacting with a lighter ones _ via _ a potential . then",
    ", using the formalism of the light - front ( lf ) relativistic quantum mechanics it is possible to encode all the nonperturbative qcd effects in a lf quark model wave function @xmath26 of a heavy hadron .",
    "the internal motion of a heavy @xmath4quark inside the heavy flavor meson is described by the distribution function @xmath27 , which represents the probability to find a heavy quark carrying a lf fraction x = p@xmath28/p@xmath29 of the meson momentum and a transverse relative momentum squared p@xmath30=*p*@xmath30 . in ref .",
    "@xcite this formalism has been used to establish a simple quantum mechanical relation between the inclusive semileptonic decay rate of the heavy hadron and that of a free heavy quark . in this paper",
    "we shall compute the preasymptotic effects for the inclusive semileptonic decays of the heavy baryons h@xmath31 in the framework of the lf quark model , which is a relativistic constituent quark model based on the lf formalism .",
    "the approach of @xcite relies on the idea of duality in summing over the final hadronic states .",
    "it has been assumed that the sum over all possible charm final states @xmath32 can be modelled by the decay width of an on  shell @xmath4 quark into an on  shell @xmath33 quark folded with the @xmath4quark distribution function @xmath34 the latter represents the probability to find a @xmath4 quark carrying a lf fraction @xmath35 of the hadron momentum and a transverse relative momentum squared @xmath36 .",
    "for the semileptonic rates the above mentioned relation takes the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the free quark differential decay rate , @xmath39 , @xmath40 being the 4momentum of the @xmath41 boson , and @xmath42 incorporates the nonperturbative effects related to the fermi motion of the heavy quark inside the hadron . the expression for @xmath43 for the case of non  vanishing lepton masses",
    "e.g. _ in @xcite .",
    "@xmath42 in ( [ 1 ] ) is obtained by integrating the bound ",
    "state factor @xmath44 over the allowed region of the invariant hadronic mass @xmath45 ( @xmath33 @xmath46 c or s ) for the underlying transitions",

    "see @xcite .    the structure of eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) suggests that in the limit of heavy quarks with infinite mass ( i.e. , @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) one has @xmath61 which means that the total inclusive width of the hadron is the same as the total inclusive width at the free quark level .",
    "the corrections to the free - quark decay picture are mainly due to the difference between the quark mass @xmath62 and the hadron mass @xmath63 as well as to the _ primordial _ motion of the @xmath4-quark inside @xmath3 .",
    "these non - perturbative corrections vanish in the heavy - quark limit @xmath59 , but at finite values of the @xmath5-quark mass a new parton description of inclusive semileptonic decays , based on the constituent quark model , has been derived .",
    "note that the quark mass @xmath62 appearing in[3 ] is the _  constituent _ quark mass that differs from the _ pole _ quark mass @xmath64 that enters the ope result for the inclusive widths . as a consequence , eq.[1 ] generally contains the correction to first order in 1/@xmath62 expansion to the free quark decay width . in principle , it is always possible to redefine the constituent quark mass @xmath62 in such a way that the 1/@xmath62 correction is eliminated from the total semileptonic width in accordance with the general statement of the ope method .",
    "this is completely analogous to the way used to eliminate 1/@xmath62 corrections from the accmm model @xcite and has been discussed within the considered approach in @xcite for a particular case of the @xmath65 decay width .",
    "a priory , there is no connection between the equal  time ( et ) wave function @xmath66 of a constituent quark model and lf wave function @xmath67 .",
    "the former depends on the center  of  mass momenta @xmath68 , while the latter depends on the lf variables @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "however , there is a simple operational connection between et and lf wave functions @xcite .",
    "the idea is to find a mapping between the variables of the wave functions that will turn a normalized solution of the et equation of motion into a normalized solution of the different looking lf equation of motion . that will allows us to convert the et wave function , and all the labor behind it , into a usable lf wave function .",
    "this procedure amounts to a series of reasonable ( but naive ) guesses about what the solution of a relativistic theory involving confining interactions might look like .",
    "we convert from et to lf momenta by leaving the transverse momenta unchanged , @xmath71 , and letting @xmath72 , where @xmath73 . in the center  of  mass frame",
    "@xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the free mass operator , @xmath76 with @xmath77 and @xmath78 the momentum fractions and the transverse momenta obey the conservation law    @xmath79    now we obtain the lf wave function from @xmath80 the straightforward calculation yields @xcite @xmath81 with    @xmath82    it can be easily verified that @xmath83 \\int \\left [ dp_{it}\\right ] |\\psi ( x_{i},{\\bf p}_{it})|^{2 }   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\bullet \\delta ( \\sum_{i}x_{i}-1)\\delta ( \\sum_{i}{\\bf p}_{i})=1\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where    @xmath84 & = & dx_{1}dx_{2}dx_{3}\\delta ( \\sum_{i}x_{i}-1 ) , \\nonumber \\\\ \\left [ dp_{it}\\right ] & = & d^{2}p_{1t}d^{2}p_{2t}td^{2}p_{3t}t\\delta ( \\sum_{i}{\\bf p}_{it})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    provided @xmath85 wave functions made kinematically relativistic in this fashion are used to calculate the form factors of heavy  to  heavy and heavy  to  light exclusive transitions @xcite .",
    "as was mentioned above , we consider the problem of a constituent bound state formed by a heavy quark interacting with the lighter ones .",
    "specifically , we consider the kalman ",
    "dsouza model for heavy baryons @xcite .",
    "the constituent quark masses are @xmath86 we denote the light quarks ( u , d , or s ) by the labels 1,2 and the heavy quark ( c or b ) by the label 3 .",
    "for the cases of @xmath87 and @xmath88 baryons where two of three quarks have equal masses we introduce the jacobi relative coordinates @xmath89 for the @xmath90 and @xmath8 baryons in the ground state , the predominant configurations ( @xmath91 ) of the heavy baryon wave functions contain no excitations in @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "hence @xmath94 where the factors @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) are given by @xmath97 with @xmath98 and @xmath99    in table 1 , we compare the theoretical predictions of the kalman - dsouza model with the experimental data .",

    "this is the most consistent quark model to - date describing baryons in the sense that a single set of parameters is used for the whole spectra and then subjecting all of their properties namely the masses , radii and their wavefunction structures to a strict test by a decay model . the spectroscopy is successfully calculated using far less parameters than any other model @xcite .",
