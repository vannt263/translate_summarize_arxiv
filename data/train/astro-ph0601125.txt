    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are identified as a brief flash of gamma - rays seen at a random location on the sky . for that instant",
    "the grb becomes the intrinsically brightest single object in the universe .",
    "the duration of a grb in terms of its prompt emission ( i.e. , the `` burst '' ) is usually defined in terms of the timescale over which 90% of the gamma - rays were detected  the t@xmath0 parameter .",
    "it is conventional to describe those grbs for which t@xmath0 @xmath1s as `` long / soft bursts '' and those with shorter duration as `` short / hard bursts '' ( e.g. kouveliotou et al . 1993 ) .",
    "it is now generally accepted that long - duration grbs result from the death of a rapidly - rotating massive star ( paczyski , 1998 ; macfadyen & woosley , 1999 ) . the stellar core collapses inwards to form a black hole surrounded by an accreting disk or torus .",
    "the accreting material liberates gravitational potential energy either in the form of neutrinos or via magneto - hydrodynamic processes .",
    "these generate a relativistic jet , oriented along the rotation axis of the stellar core , which eventually escapes the star .",
    "the jet contains a relatively modest amount of baryonic material moving at high lorentz factor .",
    "prior to the  era , almost all of our knowledge about the emission from grbs beyond a few seconds came from the study of long bursts .",
    "short bursts were , quite literally , too short to be localized by observatories prior to . the  satellite ( gehrels et al .",
    "2004 ) has changed that situation .",
    "the data for the first short bursts detected by  ( gehrels et al .",
    "2005 ; barthelmy et al .",
    "2005b ; hjorth et al .",
    "2005 ; bloom et al . 2006 ) strongly support the idea that the gamma - ray emission seen from short grbs arises from a jet powered by a merger of two compact objects , most likely two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole .",
    "the  data also show that the x - ray emission from some short bursts can be detected long after t@xmath0 , allowing for a direct comparison of the early x - ray emission between short and long grbs .",
    "some short bursts may have collimated flow ( e.g. grb051221a , burrows et al .",
    "2006 ) although this is less clear in others ( e.g. grb050724 , barthelmy et al .",
    "2005b ) .    for both types of grb",
    ", it is thought that the jet flow is inhomogeneous , leading to internal shocks caused by a variable lorentz factor ( rees & mszros 1994 ; sari & piran 1997 ) .",
    "these produce the variable gamma - ray emission seen , when viewing within the jet beam , as a grb .",
    "the gamma - ray emission typically lasts a few tens of seconds before fading below detectability with the current generation of gamma - ray instruments , including the  burst alert telescope ( bat ; barthelmy et al .",
    "the sensitivity of bat is a complicated function of burst duration and spectral shape ( see band et al .",
    "2006 ) . in practice",
    "the bat detects bursts with 15150 kev fluences as low as @xmath2 erg @xmath3 .",
    "the satellite , however , has the capability to rapidly slew and point its x - ray telescope ( xrt ; burrows et al .",
    "2005b ) and ultraviolet optical telescope ( uvot ; roming et al .",
    "2005 ) at the burst location .",
    "the xrt can detect a source at fainter flux levels in the ( observed ) 0.310 kev band than are possible using extrapolated bat data . for a crab - like spectrum and a galactic column of @xmath4 @xmath3",
    "the xrt detects @xmath5 count per 100s for a source with a 0.310 kev flux of @xmath6 erg @xmath3 s@xmath7 .",
    "thus , can routinely follow the evolution of the earliest x - ray emission from grbs with only modest gaps in the observed light curve .",
    "the grb flux can be represented as a function of time and frequency using a function @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the spectral index and @xmath10 is the temporal index is related to @xmath9 by @xmath11 . ] .",
    "analysis of some of the first bursts observed with  shows that the early x - ray light curves are complex . in some cases ( e.g. tagliaferri et al . 2005 ; hill et al .",
    "2006 ; cusumano et al . 2006 ; vaughan et al .",
    "2006a ) the early x - ray emission ( observed with the xrt within a few hundred seconds of the burst ) can decline rapidly in the first few minutes , with @xmath12 or greater .",
    "the light curve can then show a break to a shallower decay component , which we will henceforth refer to as the late emission `` hump '' .",
    "analysis of grb samples from the early phase of the mission ( nousek et al .",
    "2006 ) confirm that this pattern of a rapidly decaying light curve followed by a late emission hump is common .",
    "however , in some bursts the earliest observed x - ray flux appears to decline relatively slowly ( @xmath13 ) ( e.g. campana et al . 2005 ; blustin et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the fading x - ray emission could be due to a number of components , including high - latitude emission from the fading burst ( kumar & panaitescu 2000 ) , the interaction of the jet with the surroundings  the afterglow emission produced by an external shock ( e.g. mszros & rees 1997 ) , and thermal emission from a photosphere around the outflow ( e.g. mszros & rees 2000 ) or from a hot cocoon associated with the jet ( e.g. mszros & rees 2001 ) .",
    "a significant fraction of grbs also show x - ray flares ( e.g. burrows et al .",
    "2005a ) superimposed on the declining light curves .",
    "if the bat and the xrt are initially detecting the prompt emission from the jet , the most rapidly - decaying x - ray light curves could be due to viewing photons at high - latitudes ( i.e. large angles to the line - of - sight ) as the prompt emission fades ( kumar & panaitescu 2000 ; tagliaferri et al .",
    "2005 ; nousek et al . 2006 ; zhang et al . , 2006 ; panaitescu et al .",
    "in at least one case ( grb050219a , tagliaferri et al .",
    "2005 ) , the bat and xrt light curves do not appear to join and in other cases the observed x - ray rapid decay rate is higher than expected from the high - latitude model ( e.g. vaughan et al .",
    "alternatives such as structured jets ( e.g. zhang & mszros 2002 ) , multiple jets or patchy jets ( e.g. burrows et al .",
    "2005c ) in which we see varying emission as our light cone expands are also possibilities .",
    "these models have difficulties , however , explaining those bursts that decline relatively slowly for which other emission components , such as the afterglow , may contribute at the earliest times .",
    "both the rapid - decay and afterglow models have difficulties explaining the late emission hump .",
    "this component may be due to forward shock emission , which is refreshed with energy either due to continued emission from the central engine or because the ejecta have a range in initial lorentz factor ( rees & mszros 1998 ; sari & mszros 2000 ; zhang & mszros 2001 ; nousek et al .",
    "2006 ; zhang et al . 2006 ; granot & kumar 2006 ) .    to disentangle the relative contribution of emission from the central engine and",
    "that due to afterglow , and hence understand the origin of the early gamma - ray and x - ray emission , requires a systematic analysis of the temporal and spectral properties of a large grb sample combining data from the bat and xrt .",
    "the previous studies of grb samples from  ( e.g. nousek et al . 2006 ) include a relatively small number of grbs with early ( few minutes from trigger ) xrt observations and do not include a combined temporal and spectral analysis of data from the bat and xrt .",
    "the aim of this paper is to determine the shape of the early x - ray light curve and spectrum for a large sample of grbs for which observations were obtained early with the  narrow field telescopes .",
    "we use the combined bat and xrt data to determine whether an extrapolation of the early gamma - ray emission detected by the bat joins smoothly to that seen by the xrt , whether or not there is always a rapid decline phase seen by either instrument and to investigate the relative importance of emission from the central engine and the afterglow .",
    "our grb sample is summarized in section 2 .",
    "the analyses of the bat and xrt data are presented in sections 3 and 4 and we explain how the data from the two instruments were combined in section 5 .",
    "the observed temporal and spectral shapes are presented in section 6 . in section 7",
    "we describe a light curve fitting technique which we use to study the various components contributing to the early x - ray emission .",
    "the discussion and conclusions are given in sections 8 and 9 respectively .",
    "our initial grb list of potential bursts comprised those detected by  prior to 2005 october 1 for which  slewed to point its narrow - field instruments within 10 minutes of the burst trigger time . in the majority of cases the xrt observations started within 2 minutes . of the 45 such grbs , we excluded 5 from our detailed analysis : grb050117a ( t@xmath14s ; hill et al .",
    "2006 ) , grb050509b ( t@xmath15s ; gehrels et al . 2005 ) , grb050815 ( t@xmath16s ) , grb050906 ( t@xmath17s ) and grb050925 ( t@xmath18s ) .",
    "four of these are short and faint , and as a result insufficient x - ray photons were obtained in the first hour with which to accurately constrain the early x - ray spectral and temporal indices .",
    "only one of the excluded grbs is a long burst ( grb050117a ) .",
    "is this case the xrt obtained few data due to it being observed initially whilst  was in the south atlantic anomaly . allowing for these problems ,",
    "these bursts are consistent with the sample studied here .",
    "the 40 remaining grbs form our sample and are listed in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "following convention , the bursts are named as grb - year - month - day with a following letter ( a , b , c ... ) if multiple bursts were detected on that day .",
    "we adopt the usual t@xmath0 convention for long and short bursts , but note that the assignment does depend on the detector sensitivity and bandpass .",
    "we use the 15150 kev band .",
    "we include 2 bursts  grb050724 and grb050813  which we classify as short bursts to see how they compare .",
    "grb050724 formally has a t@xmath0 @xmath19s in the bat , but this is due to a long , fairly soft x - ray tail of emission ( barthelmy et al .",
    "it would have appeared to be a short burst with t@xmath20s in the batse / cgro instrument ( fishman et al .",
    "all of the grbs discussed in this paper were detected by the burst alert telescope .",
    "once triggered , the bat determines if there is a new point source , and the  figure - of - merit processor then computes whether this source can be observed immediately ( i.e. , is unconstrained by the earth , moon or sun ) .",
    "if so , the satellite is commanded to slew to put the target in the field of view of the narrow - field instruments .",
    "the bat continues to observe during the slew , providing an uninterrupted light curve .",
    "the bat data for the grb sample were processed using the standard bat analysis software (  software v. 2.0 ) as described in the bat ground analysis software manual ( krimm , parsons & markwardt 2004 ) and then light curves and spectra were extracted over 15150 kev , correcting the response matrix during slewsswift.gsfc.nasa.gov@xmath21docs@xmath21swift@xmath21analysis@xmath21 ] .",
    "the derived values of t@xmath0 and t@xmath23 are given in table  [ table1 ] , along with the mean fluxes and spectral indices derived from fitting single power laws ( @xmath24 ) over the period corresponding to t@xmath0 .",
    "thus , the spectral properties are averages over t@xmath0 . throughout this paper",
    "all quoted errors on fit parameters correspond to 90% confidence for a single parameter ( i.e. @xmath25 ) .",
    "xspec v11.3 ( arnaud 1996 ) was used to fit the bat and xrt spectra .",
    "a single power law provides a statistically acceptable fit to the bat data in most cases .",
    "the four grbs for which a cut - off power law model ( @xmath26 ) provides a significantly better fit ( at @xmath27% confidence ) with a well determined @xmath28 are noted in table  [ table2 ] , which gives the low energy spectral indices ( @xmath29 ) and the e - folding energies of the exponential cut off ( @xmath30 . the t@xmath0 and @xmath31 distributions are not significantly different from those found for previous grb samples .",
    "the xrt observations used here began at the times given in column 2 of table  [ table3 ] .",
    "these times are relative to the grb trigger time determined by the bat .",
    "the xrt observations incorporate data taken using the various operating modes of the instrument ( see hill et al .",
    "2004 ) and were corrected for pile - up where appropriate using the method described in nousek et al .",
    "the bulk of the xrt data presented here were obtained using windowed timing ( wt ) or photon counting ( pc ) modes ( event grades 02 and 012 respectively ) .",
    "the xrt data were processed using xrtpipeline v0.8.8 into filtered event lists which were then used to extract spectra and light curves for the 0.310 kev energy range .",
    "the x - ray light curves are generally complex , often with `` flares '' and frequent changes in temporal slope which can occur over short time intervals , particularly at early times . as an initial simple parameterisation ,",
    "we have fitted the xrt light curves obtained over the first few orbits with a broken power law model with flux @xmath32 before some break time , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 after the break .",
    "this function quantifies the early decay rate and any late emission hump .",
    "the temporal decay slopes and the break times are given in table  [ table3 ] and were determined using the bat trigger time as @xmath35 .",
    "this time corresponds to the start of the first foreground interval for which the bat was able to locate a point source .",
    "this may not coincide with the initial rise in count rate .    for grb50319 automatic",
    "triggering was disabled during the start of the burst as  was slewing , and the grb actually started some 135s before the bat trigger ( cusumano et al .",
    "2006 ) . for that grb",
    "we include all data following the onset of the burst determined from the pre- and post - bat - trigger light curve using the @xmath35 from cusumano et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "we have visually judged when to exclude flares and short - duration changes of slope to provide the early xrt decay index ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "we stress , however , that such a representation is indicative of , rather than completely representative of , the complex x - ray light curves .",
    "we return to this issue in section 7 where we adopt a more automatic approach to parameterise the light curve and to select @xmath35 . unlike nousek",
    "et al . ( 2006 ) , we do not distinguish in table  [ table3 ] between those bursts that decay rapidly or slowly in the earliest xrt observations .",
    "that is , we do not group bursts into decay phases based on assuming an early steep decay phase is always visible  we show later that this is not always the case .",
    "rather the values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 given in table  [ table3 ] correspond to the decay rates either side of the first clearly observed temporal break in the xrt light curve . in some bursts",
    "no break in x - ray temporal slope is clearly detected using the xrt data alone , in which case only @xmath36 is tabulated .",
    "the mean value of @xmath36 is 2.45 with a standard deviation of 1.55 .",
    "x - ray spectra were obtained from the early data and fitted with a single power law model , allowing for both galactic ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) and intrinsic absorption using the wabs model in xspec .",
    "the default cross sections and abundances were used ( morrison & mccammon 1983 ; andres & ebihara 1982 ) .",
    "the derived early xrt spectral indices ( @xmath38 ) and absorbing columns are given in table  [ table3 ] .",
    "in general little evidence is found for spectral evolution across early temporal breaks ( see also nousek et al .",
    "2006 ) but where evolution is seen the xrt spectrum tends to get harder . aside from grb 050525a where photo - diode mode data were used , the data used for the xrt spectra were obtained from the first orbit of wt data ( pre - break for grb 050219a and pre - flare for grb 050502b ) or the first orbit of pc mode data ( grbs 050126 , 050128 , 050315 , 050319 ( pre - break ) , 050401 , 050406 ( pre - flare ) , 050412 , 050416a ( pre - break ) , 050607 , 050813 , 050826 , 050908 and 050916 ) .",
    "a majority of the grbs show evidence for excess absorption above the galactic column at the @xmath27% confidence level .",
    "the excesses given in table  [ table3 ] have been converted to rest - frame absorbing columns for those grbs for which a redshift is known . for the bursts with redshifts , the intrinsic column ranges from @xmath39 @xmath3 up to @xmath40 @xmath3 consistent with the idea that these grbs occur in a molecular cloud environment ( reichart & price 2002 ; campana et al .",
    "as the bat and xrt data cover different energy bands and seldom overlap in time , to compare them the data for one instrument must be extrapolated into the bandpass of the other .",
    "we have chosen to use the 0.310 kev bandpass to determine fluxes as the bulk of the temporal data , particularly during the decline , were obtained using the xrt .    in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] we plot of the distribution of @xmath31 and @xmath38 .",
    "the solid line shows equality of spectral index . there is a trend such that the early xrt data are fitted by a systematically softer power law than the bat data ( i.e. @xmath41 ) .",
    "the mean values of @xmath31 ( using single power law fits ) and @xmath38 are 0.74 and 1.16 with standard deviations of 0.50 and 0.76 respectively .",
    "the spectral trend is in the same sense as the known tendency for grb prompt gamma - ray emission to become softer at later times ( ford et al .",
    "we have used this tendency when combining the bat and xrt data to form the unabsorbed , 0.310 kev flux light curves shown in fig .  [ figure2 ] .",
    "these light curves were constructed by : ( a ) converting the xrt count rates into unabsorbed fluxes using the power law model parameters as given in table  [ table3 ] ; and ( b ) converting the bat 15150 kev count rates into unabsorbed 0.310 kev fluxes by extrapolating the bat data to the xrt band using a power law model with a spectral index which is the mean of the xrt and best - fit bat spectral indices .",
    "this method was used for all bursts except grb050714b for which the early xrt spectral index is exceptionally soft and appears to evolve rapidly ( levan et al .",
    "2006 ) . for grb050714b",
    "we have used the @xmath31 from table  [ table1 ] to convert bat counts to flux .",
    "it should be noted that in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] the time axis is limited at @xmath42s to emphasise the early part of the light curve .",
    "for some bursts observations continued beyond that time and all data were included when performing the temporal fits given in table  [ table3 ] and when analysing the data further in section 6 .",
    "the observed spectra for the bat and xrt and the ratio of the spectra to a power law are also shown in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] . in these plots",
    "the relative normalisations of the xrt and bat data were allowed to be free parameters while the spectral index was frozen at the single power law value obtained for the bat .",
    "the residuals illustrate the generally softer x - ray spectrum seen by the xrt compared to the bat .",
    "the observed grb properties for the  sample in terms of spectral hardness and duration indicate that it is broadly representative of the grb population observed by batse ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "1993 ; berger et al .",
    "the difference is that provides x - ray data over a much longer time interval than previous missions and can detect grbs with lower mean fluxes . combining the bat and xrt data",
    "also allows for a view of the prompt phase of grb emission with little or no temporal gap .",
    "although grb light curves can have considerable structure superimposed on the overall decline ( see below ) following the initial burst , the data shown in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] strongly suggest that there is no discontinuity between the emission seen by the bat and the later emission seen by the xrt . in every case where the burst was long enough for the xrt to start observing before the end of t@xmath0 the bat and xrt light curves join smoothly . for those grbs where there is a temporal gap of only a few tens of seconds",
    "the light curves can be smoothly extrapolated to join .",
    "for those grbs with a short t@xmath0 the extrapolation is naturally over a longer time , but even for these cases the bat and xrt data appear to join up .    the only cases for which there is a temporal gap and where the extrapolated bat light curve may not agree with the xrt are grb050219a and possibly grb050525a . for grb050219a , allowing for",
    "the spectral evolution observed by the bat does not resolve this problem ( tagliaferri et al .",
    "2005 ; goad et al .",
    "the apparent discontinuity could , however , be due to an x - ray flare in this burst around 90s after the trigger .",
    "as noted above , the presence of late x - ray flares in grbs is now known to be common . for grb050525a ,",
    "which like grb050219a is best - fitted by a cut - off power law in the bat , some spectral evolution or an early break in the light curve similar to that in grb050713a could be responsible .",
    "for the 5 bursts excluded from detailed analysis , no counts were detected with the xrt for grb050906 and grb050925 . the combined bat+xrt x - ray light curve for grb050815 suggests it declined rapidly before 100s and then decayed more slowly until a few thousand seconds , similar to the x - ray decay seen in grb050509b ( gehrels et al . 2005 ) .",
    "grb050117a , which was observed while  was in the south atlantic anomaly , appears to display a rapid decline after the prompt phase followed by a shallow decline until 10ks ( hill et al .",
    "2006 ) , and hence is consistent with the behaviour of the rest of the long bursts in the sample .",
    "as grbs are , by their very nature , transient , all bursts show a decline following the prompt phase .",
    "the rate of decline , and how long it lasts , varies .",
    "this is indicated by the large standard deviation in @xmath36 noted above .",
    "visual inspection of the light curves show that some two - thirds of the grbs have x - ray light curves that show an early more rapid phase of decline which then breaks to a late emission hump .",
    "this temporal break is observed to occur over a wide range of times but is usually within the first hour , and is clearly not a jet break .",
    "the remaining grbs seem to have a continuous decline .",
    "those which do not seem to flatten have only a single ( @xmath36 ) decay index given in table  [ table3 ] .",
    "the mean value of the x - ray spectral index is not different between those grbs with or without a rapid decay phase .",
    "around half of the grbs appear to show late ( @xmath43 t@xmath0 ) x - ray flares .",
    "these include grb050406 , 050502b , 050607 , 050713a , 050714b , 050716 , 050724 , 050801 , 050813 , 050820a , 050822 , 050904 , 050908 , 050916 and 050922b . a few others ( e.g. grb050219a , 050319 , 050802 , 050915a )",
    "may have flares at the start of the xrt observation .",
    "most of these flares contain the equivalent of 10% or less of the prompt fluence , but in a few cases have @xmath44% ( e.g. grb050502b ( burrows et al .",
    "2005b ) and grb050820a ( osborne et al . 2006 ) ) .",
    "there is no significant difference between the rate of flares for those grbs with or without a very steep decline x - ray phase .",
    "neither @xmath36 nor @xmath38 are significantly correlated with t@xmath0 .",
    "there is a weak correlation between @xmath36 and @xmath38 ( fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] ; spearman s rank correlation coefficient @xmath45 , significant at 95% ) , although this depends on including grb050714b .",
    "in contrast , over a wide range in @xmath36 , there is a very strong correlation between ( @xmath46 ) and @xmath36 ( fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] , @xmath47 , significant at @xmath48% ) .",
    "the sense of the correlation is such that those grbs with shallower temporal decays have a smaller difference between their temporal and spectral indices .",
    "this correlation is consistent with no strong dependence of @xmath38 on @xmath36 .",
    "it has been suggested ( e.g. nousek et al .",
    "2006 ; zhang et al .",
    "2006 ) that the steeply declining early x - ray emission seen in early xrt observations can be interpreted in terms of `` high latitude '' emission ( kumar & panaitescu 2000 ) . in this model",
    "if the physical process producing the x - ray emission ( such as internal shock activity ) stops , the observed emission will continue for a short time as the observer will continue to see emission from those parts of the jet which are off the immediate line of sight .",
    "thus emission at angles @xmath49 from the line of sight which are in excess of @xmath50 will start to dominate the observed emission , where @xmath51 is the jet lorentz factor . for a uniform surface brightness jet ,",
    "the energy in some bandpass will fall as @xmath52 where the spectrum is @xmath53 ( kumar & panaitescu 2000 ) . in terms of spectral index , this model predicts a relation such that @xmath54 for the early , rapidly declining part of the temporal decay .",
    "it is possible to get a shallower decay if viewing a structured - jet off - axis ( dyks , zhang & fan 2006 ) although the general trend is similar to the standard high - latitude model .    from fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] , for the entire sample @xmath36 appears to be largely independent of @xmath38 or at least is not simply related .",
    "this is inconsistent with the concept that the early x - ray emission is usually dominated by high latitude emission in a uniform jet .",
    "an alternative explanation for the early x - ray emission grbs is afterglow emission , but this also predicts a specific relation between the spectral and temporal indices , as discussed below .",
    "overall , the data shown in fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] suggest that no single model will explain all of the bursts .    to try and force a fit with a particular model we could adjust the start time of the time series , @xmath35 , to some point in the prompt light curve such that the relation between @xmath10 and @xmath9 fits a particular model and is not simply defined by the bat trigger time .. for example , moving forwards to a late flare , if one is observed , or earlier to a visually estimated start time . rather than",
    "adopt such a subjective and model dependent approach , we have developed a method to automatically align the light curves . in sections 7 and 8",
    "we use this technique to investigate the early x - ray light curve in grbs and hence determine the contribution of likely emission components .",
    "in order to compare light curves for different grbs and to study the different phases of the x - ray emission , we have developed a procedure to fit light curves .",
    "this procedure , described below , attempts to provide a best fit to the `` global light curve '' for all our grbs , assuming there is a generic pattern to their behaviour .",

    "an average x - ray decay curve expressed by log(time ) as a function of log(flux ) , @xmath55 , and log(flux ) as a function of log(time ) , @xmath56 , was derived by taking the sum of scaled versions of each of the individual light curves , @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is approximately the time since the largest / latest peak in the bat light curve .",
    "the data points were transformed to normalised log(flux ) , @xmath59 , and log(time ) delay values , @xmath60 .",
