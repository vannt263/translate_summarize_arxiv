    "dzyaloshinskii@xcite was the first to point out that weak ferromagnetism in antiferromagnetic compounds can be explained by an antisymmetric spin - spin interaction .",
    "the microscopic basis for this theory was later given by moriya,@xcite who extended anderson s superexchange theory@xcite to include the spin - orbit interactions .",
    "he considered that only the antisymmetric part of the anisotropic spin - spin interactions he derived was relevant because it is linear in the spin - orbit coupling , while the symmetric anisotropies are of second order .",
    "however , in a recent work shekhtman _",
    "et al._@xcite showed that the symmetric anisotropic term can not be neglected , and that the whole two - spin anisotropic interaction can be mapped onto the isotropic heisenberg interaction by a bond - depending rotation of the original spins .",
    "this surprising result means that the anisotropy coming from the spin - orbit coupling does not lift by itself the ground - state degeneracy , unless the required local transformations to map the entire hamiltonian to the isotropic one are not all consistent . using the mapping to the isotropic model these authors showed that infinitely many states with different ferromagnetic moments are degenerate with the purely antiferromagnetic one .",
    "then , they concluded that some kind of frustration of the required local transformations is a necessary ingredient to have a definite ferromagnetic moment in the ground - state , a condition that had been previously overlooked .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite are relevant to explain the small ferromagnetic moment observed in the cuo@xmath2 planes of undoped la@xmath2cuo@xmath3.@xcite this compound undergoes a structural phase transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic symmetry at @xmath7 k.@xcite in the orthorhombic phase the cuo@xmath8 octahedra forming each cuo layer tilt in a staggered pattern about the @xmath9 axis , and this distortion combined with the dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interactions induces a weak ferromagnetic moment in each layer .",
    "et al._@xcite determined the dm vectors in both phases from symmetry analysis and detailed microscopic calculations .",
    "they emphasized that the existence of a net ferromagnetic moment requires an alternating pattern of moriya vectors that change in sign from one bond to the next .",
    "however , only the consideration of the hidden symmetry discussed in @xcite allows one to show that only for the orthorhombic symmetries the corresponding pattern leads to the observed small ferromagnetic moment , while those of the tetragonal phase do not allow it .",
    "these results where later generalized by bonesteel@xcite to describe the intermediate phase observed in la@xmath4nd@xmath5cuo@xmath3 , where the oxygen octahedra rotate around a general axis in the cuo@xmath2 plane.@xcite    in this work we focus on the study of the heisenberg hamiltonian with dm interaction in the strong quantum limit @xmath1 . the same hamiltonian was previously studied by semiclassical linear spin - wave theory in refs .",
    "@xcite , with the emphasis put on magnon dispersion relations",
    ". however , since the classical ground state is not collinear , relevant three - boson terms coming from the holstein - primakoff representation of spins have been ignored . in this case",
    "we extend the schwinger - boson theory discussed in @xcite to consider the anisotropic dm terms , and include magnon - magnon interactions in a saddle - point evaluation of the resulting bosonic hamiltonian .",
    "we give a fairly detailed account of the energy , ferromagnetic moment , and gap behaviors as a function of the size and relative orientation of moriya vectors , and compare these results with similar predictions from linear spin - wave theory .",
    "we will first specialize the calculations for the pattern of microscopic moriya vectors corresponding to the orthorhombic phase in la@xmath10cuo@xmath3 .",
    "then , in the last part of this work , we will generalize our approach to describe the intermediate phase in la@xmath4nd@xmath5cuo@xmath3 .",
    "the layout of this work is as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we discuss the representation by schwinger bosons of the anisotropic terms coming from the dm interaction . in sec .",
    "3 we describe the classical ground state of the model , and interpret its structure as a spiral order in a topologically - equivalent decorated lattice .",
    "this allows us to make contact with the theory developed in @xcite . in sec .",
    "4 we sketch the calculation of quantum fluctuations above this classical ground state .",
    "we give here explicit expressions in terms of the order parameters for the quasiparticle dispersion relation , ground - state energy , etc . in sec .",
    "5 we solve numerically the consistency equations and present the results for relevant quantities .",
    "in addition , in sec .",
    "6 we generalize the calculations to describe the intermediate phase in la@xmath4nd@xmath5cuo@xmath3 and discuss the effects of including the oxygen @xmath6 orbitals.@xcite finally , we end up with some conclusions .",
    "in its simplest derivation,@xcite the heisenberg hamiltonian including the dm interaction can be obtained starting from the one - electron hamiltonian    @xmath11    where @xmath12 are nearest neighbor sites , and the term nondiagonal in spin space takes into account the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "we assume nondegenerate ground - state orbitals , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are taken independent of the bond @xmath15 for simplicity .",
    "the unit vector @xmath16 .",
    "then , by using second - order perturbation theory in the presence of an on - site repulsion @xmath17@xcite one obtains the interaction between spins at sites @xmath12 as    @xmath18    in this expression the superexchange interaction @xmath19 .",
    "the last two terms of ( [ e ] ) are the contributions coming from the spin - orbit interaction of the original electrons .",
    "they contain the antisymmetric moriya vector @xmath20 , and the symmetric anisotropy tensor @xmath21 .",
    "in fact , ( [ e ] ) can be most simply written as@xcite @xmath22 \\right)\\ ] ] @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "the spins @xmath25 are obtained by rotating the original ones around the @xmath26 axis : @xmath27 with the rotation angles given by @xmath28 .    at this point",
    "we introduce the schwinger representation @xmath29 , where the bosonic spinor @xmath30 .",
    "then , the rotational invariant structure in ( [ ss ] ) can be written in the usual way@xcite as @xmath31 in terms of the @xmath32 singlets @xmath33 in ( [ ab ] ) the colons denote a normal - ordered product of bose operators .    from standard rotation properties we have : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the three - dimensional matrix that rotates an angle @xmath14 around the @xmath26 axis , and @xmath36 $ ] is the corresponding @xmath32 matrix . in this way we have @xmath37 , and this relation can be replaced in the definitions of the @xmath38 singlets in order to express them in terms of the unrotated spinors : @xmath39 here , in addition to the singlets @xmath40 we have defined @xmath41 by replacing ( [ ab]),([abcd ] ) in ( [ ss ] ) we can identify the correct expressions in terms of schwinger bosons of the spin interactions : @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 in this way the dm terms are given as products of bilinear boson operators that have the same rotational properties of the original spin interactions .",
    "this allows us to perform a conserving mean - field approximation by breaking these products .",
    "however , before undertaking the study of the resulting mean - field hamiltonian , in the next section we specialize the above results for the cuo@xmath2 planes in the low - temperature orthorhombic ( lto ) phase of la@xmath2cuo@xmath3 , and discuss how to describe the structure of the corresponding classical ground states as commensurate spiral orders .",
    "if the rotations required at every site to bring the spin - spin interactions for _ all _ bonds in the lattice to the form ( [ ss ] ) are compatible , then the hamiltonian @xmath45 is isomorphic to the isotropic heisenberg model .",
    "this happens when the product of the four rotations around each basic plaquette in the lattice equals unity , which corresponds to the _ unfrustrated _ case . in this case , in correspondence with the ground - state degeneracy of ( [ ss ] ) there is also a large degeneracy in the ground state of @xmath46 .",
    "> from the relations ( [ rot ] ) between original and rotated spins we see that by judiciously chosing the direction of the nel we can find ground states of @xmath46 with no net ferromagnetic moment ( @xmath47 parallel to @xmath26 ) up to a maximum ferromagnetic moment of @xmath48  ( @xmath47 perpendicular to @xmath26 ) .",
    "even though @xmath49 in ( [ e ] ) points in a special direction in spin space , because of the presence of the symmetric tensor @xmath21 this anisotropy does not lift the degeneracy of the ground state.@xcite    according to the above discussion , in order to have a net ferromagnetic moment there should be some degree of _ frustration _ in the system.@xcite that is , there should exist no spin rotations that map the entire hamiltonian onto an isotropic one .",
    "in particular , in the lto phase of la@xmath2cuo@xmath3 the crystal structure leads to the pattern of moriya vectors shown in fig .",
    "1 . in this figure @xmath50 and @xmath51 ,",
    "where @xmath52 ,   @xmath53 , and @xmath54 as in the previous section@xcite .",
    "then , the magnetic structure can be described in terms of two interpenetrating sublattices .",
    "defining @xmath55 , it has been shown@xcite that the system develops a net ferromagnetic moment only when both @xmath56 and @xmath57 are different from zero @xmath58 .",
    "in such a case the staggered magnetization of the ground state is directed along @xmath56 , and the ferromagnetic moment is proportional to @xmath59 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) .    in the two - sublattice picture",
    "the classical ground state has magnetizations @xmath60 and @xmath61 , with @xmath62 ( we are using the @xmath63-axis in spin space directed along @xmath64 and the @xmath65-axis perpendicular to the cuo@xmath2 plane ) . in order to make contact with the theory developed in @xcite",
    "it is convenient to describe this state as a commensurate spiral order in a distorted lattice . to this end",
    "we move the sites belonging to sublattices @xmath40 by vectors @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , so that the basis vectors of the new decorated square lattice are @xmath68 and @xmath69   ( we took the original lattice constant @xmath70 and used arrows instead of boldface to indicate vectors in real space ) .",
    "the magnetic order is then given by @xmath71 , where the magnetic wavevector @xmath72 and the @xmath73 s indicate the sites of the distorted lattice .",
    "this classical ground state can be described by condensing the schwinger bosons according to @xmath74 . in the next section",
    "we will incorporate the quantum fluctuations on this description by considering the schwinger - boson dynamics to mean - field order .",
    "once @xmath46 is expressed in terms of schwinger bosons as indicated in sec .",
    "2 ( see ( [ rep ] ) ) , all the four - boson products are decoupled using as order parameters the mean values of the correlations @xmath75  between sites in different sublattices .",
    "then , the mean - field hamiltonian becomes : @xmath76 - n\\sum_{\\vec \\delta } ( |{\\cal b}({\\vec    \\delta})|^2 - |{\\cal a}({\\vec \\delta})|^2 ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath77  , and @xmath78 are their corresponding mean - field values . here",
    "@xmath79 is the number of decorated unit cells and @xmath80 runs on the @xmath81 sublattice . in particular , because of the geometry of moriya vectors in fig .",
    "1 , the @xmath82 operators take the simple form @xmath83 with @xmath84  ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "we perform now a transformation to reciprocal space according to @xmath86 where @xmath87 and the @xmath88 s are the normal modes of the decorated lattice .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian has to be supplemented by adding , through lagrange multipliers @xmath89 , the restrictions on the number of bosons on each sublattice : @xmath90 notice , however , that these restrictions are only the average of the exact constraints _ per site _ required to have a faithful representation of the spin algebra . with this simplication",
    "we obtain a @xmath91 dynamical matrix which has to be diagonalized numerically .",
    "however , the solution of the mean - field equations for the @xmath92 order parameters shows that , for the symmetry of the spiral order , the parameters @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "then , the original dynamical matrix decouples in two @xmath95 blocks given by : @xmath96 and the corresponding one with @xmath97 replaced by @xmath98  .",
    "we have defined : @xmath99 paraunitary diagonalization of ( [ delta ] ) produces the quasiparticle dispersion relations @xmath100 numerical evaluation ( see next section ) shows that the in - plane and out - of - plane gaps are degenerate . for the unfrustrated case @xmath101 , so that @xmath102 , and this equation reduces to @xmath103 .",
    "as expected , these degenerate quasiparticle bands correspond to an antiferromagnet with renormalized interaction @xmath104  ( see ( [ ss ] ) ) .",
    "the ground - state energy is given by @xmath105  .",
    "the mean - field equations that determine the parameters @xmath106 and @xmath107 are obtained by minimization of @xmath108 . in the next section",
    "we discuss the results obtained by solving numerically these equations .",
    "we have solved numerically the consistency equations by iteration , starting from the classical values of the order parameters and lagrange multiplier ( the classical values of the order parameters can be obtained by using the structure of the boson condensate given at the end of sec . 3 , and @xmath109 ) .",
    "for the unfrustrated case @xmath101   we obtain , as expected , two doubly - degenerate quasiparticles branches corresponding to an isotropic antiferromagnet with the effective coupling @xmath110 . for @xmath111",
    "infinitesimally smaller than @xmath112 one of these branches develops gaps at @xmath113 , which correspond to the degenerate in- and out - of - plane gaps associated to the anisotropy .",
    "the other branch remains very much unaffected , i.e. , almost identical to the isotropic renormalized antiferromagnetic dispersion . for large @xmath0",
    "the gapped branch becomes the linear spin - wave dispersion relation.@xcite in fig .",
    "4 we plot both branches for @xmath114 and @xmath115   along the typical @xmath116 path there indicated .",
    "the dashed line gives the results of linear spin - wave theory for comparison .",
    "the fact that one of the branches remain gapless can be understood by noticing that in the schwinger - boson approach the existence of a local magnetization is intimately linked to the boson condensation .",
    "then , in order for the system to have a magnetized ground state , the chemical potential ( lagrange multiplier ) must be pinned to the bottom of one of the original boson bands , giving a gapless quasiparticle branch .",
    "this can be confirmed by simply studying the isotropic antiferromagnet with a staggered magnetic field . on the other hand , from a physical point of view",
    "this is not a problem since the exact form of the constraint requires creation and destruction of both kind of quasiparticles to describe a magnon . in fig .",
    "5 we plot the gap as a function of @xmath117 for @xmath114@xcite .",
    "notice that for the physical value @xmath118 the result is indistinguishable from the spin wave prediction .",
    "the classical energy is given by @xmath119 , and is independent of the frustration . in fig .",
    "6 we plot the ratio between the quantum and classical ground - state energies as a function of @xmath111 for several values of @xmath117 .",
    "as can be seen , quantum fluctuations are sensitive to the degree of frustration , although the changes in energy are not important even for unphysically large values of @xmath117 . in fig .",
    "7 we plot the behavior of the net ferromagnetic moment for the same values of @xmath117 . as expected,@xcite",
    "it goes to zero for @xmath120 , where the dzyaloshinskii vector @xmath121 vanishes and the ground - state configuration is completely antiferromagnetic ( see sec . 3 ) .",
    "the values at @xmath101 correspond to the ferromagnetic moments in the unfrustrated case ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "however , these moments are unobservable since , as pointed out above , in this case the hamiltonian becomes isomorphic to the isotropic heisenberg model.@xcite notice that this happens only exactly at @xmath101 ; for slightly different values the system develops a relatively large net ferromagnetic moment .",
    "notably , as shown in fig . 7 in the quantum case the maximum ferromagnetic moment is obtained for some intermediate value of @xmath111 which depends weakly on @xmath117 .",
    "in the lto phase the cuo@xmath8 octahedra forming each cuo layer tilt in a staggered pattern about the @xmath9 axis . in this section",
    "we consider the effects of dm interactions which occur in the presence of tilting distorsions about an arbitrary axis .",
    "such general tilting distorsions may have physical relevance for la@xmath4nd@xmath5cuo@xmath3.@xcite    in order to generalize the above calculations for an arbitrary direction of the octahedra tilting axis we have to perform the following changes : i ) in sec .",
    "2 , the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 of ( [ 1e ] ) must be bond dependent , which implies that @xmath123 is also bond dependent ; ii ) in sec .",
    "3 , the new pattern of moriya vectors is given by @xmath124 and @xmath125 , with @xmath126 the angle between the octahedra rotation axis and the @xmath127 $ ] direction in the cuo plane , and @xmath128@xcite ( the angle @xmath126 equals zero in the tetragonal phase and @xmath129 in the orthorhombic phase ) .",
    "furthermore , the angle @xmath130 which characterizes the classical ground - state spin configuration satisfies @xmath131 , where @xmath132@xcite ; iv ) in sec .",
    "4 , the parameter @xmath133 is now bond dependent .",
    "this leads to different @xmath107 for each bond direction , but @xmath134 remains zero and the dispersion relations have the same formal expression . with these changes we obtained the following results : the ground - state energy and gap depend slightly on the tilting axis angle @xmath126 . on the contrary",
    ", the net ferromagnetic moment is strongly dependent on @xmath126 ( see fig .",
    "it vanishes in the tetragonal phase ( @xmath135 ) and reaches its maximum value in the lto phase ( @xmath136 ) .",
    "in @xcite it has been suggested that the inclusion of the oxygen @xmath6 orbitals would account for the weak ferromagnetism in the lto phase of la@xmath2cuo@xmath3 , with the frustration origin advocated in @xcite being irrelevant .",
    "however , entin - wohlman _",
    "et al._@xcite showed that the effects of introducing these orbitals is too small to be responsible for the observed weak ferromagnetism . on the other hand",
    ", the multilevel mechanism does break the degeneracy of the in- and out - of - plane gaps , although the relative magnitude of this breaking is again too small when compared to experiments .",
    "we have also considered including the @xmath6 orbitals in our calculations . in this case",
    "the required changes are the following : i ) in sec .",
    "( [ ss ] ) has to be replaced by @xmath137 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath138 is proportional to the energy difference between the @xmath6 and @xmath139 orbitals of the oxygen@xcite ; ii ) in sec .",
    "3 , the angle @xmath130 that describes the classical ground state has a complex expression in terms of the parameters of the model .",
    "we have obtained it by numerical minimization of the classical energy ; iii ) in sec .",
    "4 , the mean - field hamiltonian ( [ mfh ] ) has to be written as a function of the four order parameters @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "the @xmath142 dynamical matrix no longer decouples in two blocks , so that its paraunitary diagonalization has to be performed numerically . in fig .",
    "9 we present the new dispersion relations obtained in this case , for @xmath143  , and @xmath144 . as can be seen ,",
    "the degenerate gapped branch splits into two branches that differ mostly near the gap wavevector .",
    "however , even for this large @xmath138 the ratio between the in- and out - of - plane gaps is still much smaller than the experimental value . finally , in fig .",
    "10 we plot the ferromagnetic moment for different values of @xmath138 .",
    "remarkably , for some special value of @xmath126 this moment becomes independent of @xmath138 .",
    "we presented a schwinger - boson approach to the heisenberg model with dm interaction .",
    "we showed how to represent the anisotropic dm interactions in terms of schwinger bosons keeping the correct symmetries present in the spin representation , which allowed us to perform a conserving mean - field approximation .",
    "unlike previous studies of this model by linear spin - wave theory , our approach takes into account magnon - magnon interactions already at mean - field order and includes the effects of three - boson terms , characteristic of noncollinear phases , which are ignored in standard studies .",
    "our results recover the linear spin - wave predictions in the semiclassical large-@xmath0 limit , and show a small renormalization in the strong quantum limit @xmath1 .    although the emphasis was put on the basic properties of the model hamiltonian studied , for definiteness we considered a pattern of moriya vectors corresponding to the lto phase in la@xmath2cuo@xmath3 . in the last section we generalized the calculations to discuss the behavior of relevant quantities for arbitrary directions of the octahedra tilting axis , which might be relevant to describe the intermediate phase in la@xmath4nd@xmath5cuo@xmath3 .",
    "finally , we have also considered the inclusion of nondegenerate @xmath6 oxygen orbitals , and showed that they can not account for the experimentally observed difference between in- and out - of - plane gaps .",
