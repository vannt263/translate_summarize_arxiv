    "star formation is among the most important physical processes affecting the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , fundamental questions about the efficiency of the conversion of gas into stars and what triggers the process of star formation remain open .    observations of galaxies have shown a close correlation , known as the schmidt - kennicutt relation , between the surface density of star formation rate ( @xmath0 ) and the surface density of gas ( @xmath1 ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the details of this scaling relation are found to vary with the environment .",
    "spiral galaxies convert their gas into stars with longer depletion times than galaxies in a merger phase @xcite , but more rapidly than dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "in addition , the observed relation varies for different tracers .",
    "it is shallower for molecular gas than for total ( molecular and atomic ) gas @xcite , but steeper when the atomic gas is considered solely @xcite .",
    "several other observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have suggested the existence of a critical surface density , the so - called break , below which @xmath0 in spiral galaxies drops : star formation is inefficient compared to the regime at high surface densities , well described by a power - law .",
    "consequently , a composite relation of star formation seems to be a better description for the @xmath1@xmath0 relation , rather than a single power - law .",
    "however , the origin of the break , and the transition to a different regime of star formation at high surface densities , remain a matter of debate .",
    "some models evoke the toomre criterion for gravitational instability ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or rotational shear @xcite to interpret the existence of the break .",
    "@xcite emphasize the need for the coexistence of two thermal phases in pressure equilibrium and @xcite argues that it is the transition from the warm to the cold gas phase , enhanced by the ability of the gas to shield itself from external photo - dissociation , that triggers gravitational instabilities over a wide range of scales .",
    "self - shielding plays an important role also in the model of @xcite , where it sets the transition from atomic to molecular phase at a metallicity - dependent @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite shows that feedback from massive stars is an important regulator of the star formation efficiency in protocluster forming clouds .",
    "based on this , @xcite proposes that the break in the @xmath1@xmath0 relation can be related to a feedback - dependent transition of the star formation efficiency per unit time , as a function of the gas surface density ( but see @xcite reporting a possibly low impact of the stellar feedback on the star formation rate and efficiency ) . @xcite",
    "have recently proposed an analytic model in which the origin of the star formation break is related to the turbulent structure of the interstellar medium ( ism ) . in this model ,",
    "a threshold in the local volume density , resulting in the observed surface density break corresponds to the onset of supersonic turbulence that generates shocks which in turn trigger the gravitational instabilities and thus star formation .",
    "different mechanisms are invoked in theoretical works to explain the scaling relations , such as gravity @xcite , turbulence of the interstellar medium ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "in addition to these theoretical studies , several galaxy simulations modeling the ism found a reasonable agreement with observations , using various recipes for star formation and stellar feedback @xcite . among them",
    "@xcite resolved the small scale physics of star formation in the context of galactic scale dynamics .",
    "the observed correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath0 , together with the break of @xmath0 are often reproduced in simulations , but it remains unclear to what extent the star formation rate estimates depend on the parameters of individual models and underlying assumptions , and what are the fundamental drivers for the observed relations .",
    "in this paper we aim at providing a better understanding of the star formation relations and threshold by studying the local properties of simulated galaxies .",
    "our work is in great part motivated by the analytic model of @xcite , based on the supersonic nature of the turbulence in the ism .",
    "their formalism leads to an analytic expression relating @xmath1 and @xmath0 that depends on three parameters : the mach number , the star formation density threshold and the thickness of the star - forming regions .",
    "one assumption of this model is the characterization of an entire star - forming region by a single set of these three parameters , while wide ranges of them are more appropriate for describing the real ism .",
    "another assumption is the description of the gas volume density by a log - normal distribution , which was primarily found for isothermal supersonic turbulence ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "such irregular pdf reveals the density contrast between diffuse gas and several high density clumps .",
    "the shape of the density pdf is determined by global properties of galaxies and physical processes of their ism . as suggested by @xcite",

    "note that smc@xmath23 , which has a lower metallicity than lmc@xmath22 , is able to reach the highest densities .",
    "metallicity is important for cooling : the more metallic gas is more efficient at cooling the gas down and should allow reaching higher densities .",
    "however , we do not observe such trend .",
    "this could indicate that factors other than thermal may be key in setting the gas distribution .",
    "another possible explanation could be a mismatch between the choices of threshold density @xmath4 for star formation and the metallicity in the lmc@xmath22 .",
    "if @xmath4 is chosen to be low , stars will form in an intermediate density medium , i.e. without the need of gravitational collapse of a cloud into a dense region .",
    "furthermore , stellar feedback helps the destruction of the densest clumps which produces more intermediate - density gas and further prevents the gravitational contraction leading to high densities .",
    "the maximum density of the ism is thus lower than with a high @xmath4 and the resulting pdf does not yield the classical high density power - law tail .",
    "however , in the case of lmc@xmath22 , the transition of the gas from high ( @xmath3110@xmath32  10@xmath29 @xmath13 ) to intermediate densities ( 10  10@xmath27 @xmath13 , just below the actual @xmath4 ) due to the feedback would lead to a substantial reduction in the sfr ( because of the @xmath33 used in our model , the sfr is dominated by high - density gas ) .",
    "consequently , feedback itself would be substantially reduced .",
    "another , more likely explanation is that smc@xmath23 contains a much higher gas fraction compared to lmc@xmath22 ( see table [ tab : simulations ] ) leading to a much lower value of toomre parameter ( @xmath34 ) which allows smc@xmath23 to reach higher densities than in lmc@xmath22 .",

    "to study the 100 pc scale properties of individual galaxies , analyzed regions are selected by examining the face - on projections of the gas distribution .",
    "we then consider sub - regions ( referred to as beams throughout the paper ) of 100@xmath17100 pc@xmath27 in the galactic plane and with galaxy scale - height along the line of sight .",
    "a study of the impact of the beam size is presented in section [ subsec : beamsize ] .      in a given beam",
    ", the effective mach number @xmath35 is defined as : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the mass - weighted velocity dispersion and the mass - weighted sound speed with respect to the beam , respectively , calculated as follows @xmath39 and @xmath40    summations are done over all amr cells in the analyzed beam and the index @xmath41 refers to cell related quantities : @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the cell temperature , gas mass and speed , respectively .",
    "@xmath45 is the adiabatic index for monoatomic gas , @xmath46 is the mass of the hydrogen atom and @xmath47 the boltzmann constant .",
    "an alternative to the above `` beam - based '' average could be to compute the mass - weighted @xmath35 with a cell velocity dispersion itself calculated with respect to its closest cells , but we find that this does not lead to a significant difference in the results .",
    "temperature in the beam is computed as mass - weighted average : @xmath48    to estimate the actual thickness of the star - forming regions within each beam , we apply gaussian fit to 1d projection of the gas density along one of the mid - plane axes .",
    "the thickness is then defined as the full width at half maximum of the resulting fit . although the estimation method of the thickness parameter is simplistic , the obtained values are in good agreement with visual inspection of density maps of individual star - forming regions .",
    "note that in our analysis we do nt use the sfr computed directly in the simulation .",
    "the main reason is that the conversion of gas into stars is modeled as a stochastic process leading to the discretization of the @xmath0 values which make the analysis difficult by introducing more noise .",
    "the sfr of a beam is estimated from the gas content of each cell by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the local star formation rate density , @xmath51 is the density of gas in the cell , @xmath3 is the star formation efficiency per free - fall time @xmath52 and @xmath4 is the star formation threshold .",
    "@xmath0 is then given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the cell sfr density and volume , respectively and @xmath56 is the surface of the beam .",
    "similarly , @xmath1 is @xmath57 with @xmath58 representing the cell gas density .",
    "our choice of the beam size is related to the adopted analytical formalism which is tightly linked to the turbulence - driven structure of the ism .",
    "supersonically turbulent isothermal gas is found to be well described by a log - normal probability distribution function .",
    "however , once these hypotheses about the state of gas are relaxed , strictly log - normal pdf is not recovered .",
    "the pdfs of the density field in our sample of galaxies are close to , but not exactly log - normal functional forms when all scales are considered ( see section [ subsec : pdf ] ) .",
    "individual beams should be large enough to be representative samples of star - forming regions at different evolutionary stages .",
    "in addition , the choice of the beam size is somehow linked to the turbulence and its cascade from large scales where the turbulence is injected , down to the small scales , where the energy dissipation overcomes its transfer . in order to capture the turbulent cascade",
    ", the size of the beam should not be too large compared to the injection scale , nor too small compared to the dissipation scale . in the former case , the simulation would capture other processes than turbulence and in the latter case , turbulence would be already dissipated .",
    "to estimate the impact of the size of the beam , we compare the results in the @xmath1@xmath0 plane obtained by varying the beam width by a factor of 2.5 with respect to the one used in analysis .",
    "figure [ fig : mw_beam_compare_all ] shows the comparison for the mw@xmath24 simulation .",
    "increased beam size leads to an overall reduction of @xmath1 for the beam , which can be understood as a consequence of decreased volume fraction occupied by the dense gas . on the contrary",
    ", smaller beam size allows reaching higher values of @xmath0 .",
    "this comparison suggests that the position of points in the @xmath1@xmath0 plane depends on the considered spatial scale . @xcite",
    "found such dependence in the study of the local group spiral galaxy m33 .",
    "similarly , @xcite found a more efficient sf at scales of molecular clouds , indicating that caution should be used when comparing sf relations involving different spatial scales .",
    "however , the global behavior of the @xmath1@xmath0 does not seem to be strongly affected by the size of the beam , at least for the range of sizes that we explored .",

    "another alternative explanation for the existence of the break is that it corresponds to the transition from atomic to molecular hydrogen @xcite .",
    "according to this scenario , the transition from atomic to molecular hydrogen and the subsequent star formation depend on local conditions that vary with galactic radius , e.g. metallicity , gas pressure and shear . @xcite",
    "found such radial dependence in the sample of nearby galaxies in agreement with the findings of @xcite and the threshold interpretations of e.g. @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "similar results are reproduced in some simulations , e.g. @xcite , who find that molecular gas is a better tracer of star formation than atomic gas and plays an important role in the low surface density regions of galaxies by allowing for more efficient star formation . however , our models that do not include chemodynamics , are able to reproduce the observed break at low @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , this seems to indicate that the presence of molecules is not a necessary condition to _ trigger _ the process of star formation .",
    "however , we acknowledge numerous observational evidences showing that molecules are involved at a later stage of the sf process .    to summarize , we consider two representative beams having the same @xmath1 , but different @xmath0 ( figure [ fig : lmc_rho_rho0_mach ] ) .",
    "these beams have similar average volume densities @xmath64 which can be several orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath4 . however , the beam that happens to have the highest @xmath0 has always the highest mach number , as previously suggested by figure [ fig : mw_smc_lmc_mach ] .",
    "we have argued above that the density threshold @xmath4 , the thickness of the star - forming regions and the molecules do not have impact on the transition from the regime of inefficient star formation to the efficient power - law regime .",
    "the role of the artificial threshold @xmath4 imposed in the simulations is to set a frontier between the diffuse non - star - forming gas and the star - forming component , but not to tune the efficiency of star formation per se .",
    "therefore at a given @xmath1 , this efficiency depends mostly on the level of turbulence ( @xmath35 ) , i.e. the compression of the ism .",
    "@xcite proposed that the break indeed corresponds to the onset of supersonic turbulence which , by generating shocks , triggers gravitational instabilities leading to star formation . in figures [ fig : smc_model ] and [ fig : mw_model ] , we compare simulations of mw@xmath24 and smc@xmath23 with the analytical model of @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the relation between @xmath1 and @xmath0 depends on three parameters : the mach number @xmath35 , the scale - height @xmath68 and the star formation volume density threshold @xmath4 .",
    "we do not compare each star - forming region in the simulation with the model , but we are rather interested in what values these parameters should take to obtain upper and lower limits for simulated data .",
    "the break is in the subsonic regime ( measured values of @xmath35 are below unity ) which corresponds to the regime where the analytical model deviates from its asymptotic behavior ( at high @xmath1 ) . in this regime",
    "the scale - heights of the beams set the efficiency of star formation spanning the range given by the model and quantitatively in accordance with the values measured in the simulations ( figure [ fig : smc_h ] ) . in the analytical model",
    ", the power - law regime can be reached even with the mach number below unity ( red curve ) .",
    "however , our simulations do not probe this area of the @xmath1@xmath0 plane : the data points in the power - law regime are exclusively supersonic and can only be described by a model with the mach number above unity ( black curve ) .",
    "smc@xmath23 : comparison with the @xcite model with three sets of parameters ( indicated in the legend ) .",
    "the black curve matches the supersonic regime of efficient star formation , while the green and the red curves represent upper and lower limits for the regime of the break , where the star formation is inefficient .",
    "the @xmath68 parameter is in agreement with values measured in the simulation ( see figure [ fig : smc_h ] ) . ]",
    "mw@xmath24 : comparison with the @xcite model . as in figure",
    "[ fig : smc_model ] , the supersonic regime is compared to the model prediction and similarly , the subsonic regime at low @xmath1 is situated between the curves characterized by the mach number lower than unity for the measured thickness . ]      in figure [ fig : smc_metallicity ] , we have shown that the exact position of the break in the @xmath1@xmath0 plane depends on metallicity .",
    "a comparison of different metallicities in otherwise identical systems shows that the slope at low @xmath1 has a greater value in metal - poor galaxies .",
    "figure [ fig:3pdf ] suggests that metallicity is not the only factor determining the gas density distribution in our simulations .",
    "similar lack of direct dependence of the fraction of dense gas on metallicity is found when simulations of the smc with different metallicities are compared ( not shown here ) .",
    "thus the slope at low @xmath1 can not be explained by the presence of a higher fraction of dense gas in systems with higher metallicity compared to systems with lower metallicity .",
    "however , metallicity has an impact on star formation , even though indirect .",
    "metallicity directly influences the temperature of the gas : higher the metallicity , more efficient the cooling therefore the temperature and , in turn , impacts the mach number . in figure",
    "[ fig : smc_metallicity2 ] , we show mach numbers for smc@xmath22 and smc@xmath23 .",
    "higher values of mach number are reached in galaxy with higher metallicity .",
    "this work does not include metallicity - dependent self - shielding and feedback .",
    "accounting for them , @xcite showed that both the fraction of gas in molecular form and the efficiency of star formation per unit time depend on metallicity .",
    "this leads to the metallicity dependent @xmath1@xmath0 relation at any @xmath1 .",
    "in this paper , we study the star formation relations and thresholds at 100 pc scale in a sample of low - redshift simulated galaxies . these include simulations representative of milky way - like spiral galaxy , the large and the small magellanic clouds .",
    "we analyze the role of interstellar turbulence , gas cooling , and geometry in drawing these relations , by investigating the dependence of the star formation on three parameters : the mach number , the thickness of the star - forming region and the star formation volume density threshold .",
    "we compare the simulated data with the idealized model for star formation of @xcite .      1 .",
    "our simulations support an interpretation of the surface density threshold for efficient star formation as the typical density for the onset of supersonic turbulence in dense gas , as proposed theoretically by @xcite . for all analyzed systems ,",
    "we obtain qualitatively the same result : regions located below the break are dominated by subsonic turbulence , while turbulence tends to be supersonic in those located in the power - law regime , .",
    "the distribution of the ism of a galaxy in the @xmath1@xmath0 plane ( mainly the position of the break ) is sensitive to metallicity , but always correlated with the mach number as detailed above .",
    "when different metallicities are considered for otherwise identical systems , @xmath0 increases with the metallicity .",
    "when different systems with same metallicities are considered ( compare figure [ fig : contour_all ] for lmc@xmath22 and figure [ fig : smc_metallicity ] for smc@xmath22 ) , roughly the same position in the @xmath1@xmath0 plot is obtained .",
    "this can explain observations of low - efficiency star formation in relatively dense gas in smc - like dwarf galaxies .",
    "the driving physical parameter is still the onset of supersonic turbulence , but this onset is harder to reach at moderate gas densities in lower - metallicity systems that can preserve warmer gas .",
    "the vertical spread in the @xmath1@xmath0 plot is given by the interplay between different parameters of star - forming regions .",
    "figures [ fig : smc_model ] and [ fig : mw_model ] show a reasonable agreement between simulations and the analytic model of @xcite , confirming that this idealized model provides a viable description of star formation in a turbulent ism compared to more realistic simulations of self - gravitating systems with star formation and feedback .",
    "the values of the model parameters ( mach number , thickness and density threshold ) characterizing the points in @xmath1@xmath0 plane are close to the values measured in simulations .",
    "several other models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have proposed that self - shielding alone is efficient at producing giant molecular clouds and triggering sf .",
    "indeed , this effect cools the gas down at high density , thus enhancing the fragmentation of the ism , but also lowering the sound speed , i.e. increasing the level of turbulence . both the compression of the ism by supersonic turbulence and the fragmenting effect from self - shielding increase with metallicity .",
    "having neglected the dependence of self - shielding on metallicity , our results emphasize only the role of supersonic turbulence in our most metal rich examples .",
    "combining the two effects would lead to a higher efficiency of star formation than either effect alone .    at the scale of clouds ,",
    "the gravitational collapse is known to trigger sf . however , at larger scales , in galactic structures like spiral arms , we found that the injection of turbulence by self - gravity ( and possibly by other processes like shear and feedback ) can drive the compression of the gas , leading to sf .",
    "in this view , an external trigger like supersonic turbulence could be a sufficient condition to from stars , without necessarily invoking the collapse of large galactic regions ( @xmath28 100 pc ) prior to turbulent compression  only compressed regions need to eventually collapse into stars .",
