    "the importance of galaxy collisions and mergers to the formation and evolution of galaxies has been clearly demonstrated by a variety of cosmological simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is believed that a galaxy experiences a close encounter with another several times during its lifetime , from a merger involving two comparable mass galaxies ( major merger ) to less catastrophic events involving a smaller companion or a satellite ( minor merger ) ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "cosmological simulations also show that hierarchical galaxy formation is an ongoing process even in the present epoch as evidenced by the ubiquitous presence of systems in the local universe that show signatures of major and minor mergers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "observations of the early universe conducted using sensitive sub - mm detectors suggest that collisions and mergers played important roles to the formation of stars and galaxies in the early epochs @xcite . studying the colliding galaxy population in the local universe ,",
    "therefore , is an important first step toward better understanding the process of galaxy formation and evolution and the star formation history in the universe .",
    "star formation requires an abundant supply of molecular gas .",
    "studies of molecular gas ( traced in co ) in the milky way has been done efficiently and extensively using single dish radio telescopes and interferometers . in extragalactic studies , extensive large scale surveys of molecular gas",
    "have been largely limited to single dish observations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a beam that subtends a large area of the sky allows an efficient determination of the total amount of the emission , and hence the total molecular gas mass , in a relatively short amount of time .",
    "the resultant large database of hundreds of galaxies yields a statistically significant comparison of the physical properties in different hubble types .",
    "a main shortcoming of these observations is the lack of spatial information resulting from the large beam sizes .",
    "interferometric observations can significantly improve the resolution problem , but sparse sampling of the uv - space by the existing array telescopes operating at millimeter wavelengths generally suffer from poor surface brightness sensitivity and limited dynamic ranges ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "in addition , an extensive survey to develop a sample size comparable to those achieved by single dish experiments would take a prohibitively long time .",
    "@xcite were the first to conduct an extensive interferometric survey of co  ( 10 ) emission in 20 nearby galaxies using the 6-element nobeyama array and the owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) millimeter array . in a more recent survey using the berkeley - illinois - maryland association ( bima ) array @xcite",
    ", 44 nearby late type galaxies were imaged at @xmath4 resolution .",
    "thus a growing database of high resolution co  ( 10 ) observations of nearby spiral galaxies is now available .",
    "single dish telescope surveys dedicated exclusively to measuring co  ( 10 ) emission in colliding disk systems have been carried out previously @xcite , but interferometric surveys of co emission with good spatial information are limited in number and in size .",
    "the emission in colliding galaxies has been studied both using single dish and interferometers , and the characteristics of the tidal tails has been used as an important diagnostics to trace the history of the interaction and star formation activity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the important next step , therefore , is to study the spatial distribution and the kinematics of dense and diffuse molecular ism in colliding systems with the high resolution afforded by interferometers .",
    "the response of the gas in a simulated disk - disk collision was investigated in detail by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper  i hereafter ) .",
    "it was found that stars respond to the tidal interaction by forming both transient arms and long lived @xmath5 bars , but the gas response is more transient , flowing directly toward the central regions within about @xmath6 years after the initial collision . comparing the predicted inflow timescale ( @xmath6 years ) with the total merger timescale ( @xmath7 years )",
    "suggests that 10 - 20% of randomly selected interacting / merging systems in the local universe have a possibility to exhibit observable signature of radial inflow .",
    "the evolution of the structural parameters such as the asymmetry ( @xmath8 ) , the concentration ( @xmath9 ) and the compactness ( @xmath10 ) parameters were investigated , and the possible use of the @xmath10 parameter and the molecular fraction ( @xmath11 ) to infer the merger chronology was suggested .",
    "it was shown that distinct emission features in the forbidden velocity quadrants of the position velocity diagram ( pvd ) identifies non - circular gas kinematics driven by the perturbation of the non - axisymmetric structure .",
    "these diagnostics tools developed using numerical simulation can be applied directly to observational data , and whether the same behavior is seen in observations is an important test concerning the validity of the physics implemented in the numerical simulations . to this end",
    ", this paper describes the observational data of 10 colliding systems in and co  ( 10 ) emission obtained using the very large array ( vla ) and owens valley radio observatory millimeter array .",
    "detailed statistical and comparative analysis of this data with a sample of nearby isolated systems can be found in our forthcoming paper ( paper  iii ) .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "first , the sample selection is described in  2 , followed by a description of the data reduction and calibration techniques in  3 .",
    "main results are presented and discussed in  4 ,  5 ,  6 and  7 .",
    "qualitative and quantitative descriptions of the individual sources are presented in  8 .",
    "a short summary is given in  9 .",
    "a significant amount of information pertaining to the interaction history can be obtained by examining the optical morphology alone .",
    "@xcite compiled a set of @xmath12 strongly interacting systems that involve two or more progenitor galaxies by visually inspecting the uppsala general catalogue ( ugc ) .",
    "he concluded that these systems show a systematically higher level of h@xmath13 luminosity and equivalent width than those found in isolated systems , but also found that about 30% of the interacting galaxies show weak or no optical emission lines much like the spectra of elliptical galaxies .",
    "a sub - set of 80 systems were further investigated by @xcite in co  ( 1 - 0 ) using both the nrao 12  m and the iram 30  m single dish radio telescopes .",
    "the interacting systems investigated in this study have been selected from the sample of @xcite according to the following criteria :    1 .",
    "* major mergers : * systems must include two nearly equal mass large spirals with @xmath14 , 2 .   * projected separation : * interacting pairs covering a wide range of separation , from 5 to 40 kpc , are chosen , 3 .",
    "* proximity : * sufficiently close ( @xmath15 mpc ) to be resolved with the ovro resolution ( @xmath16  kpc at d=100  mpc ) , 4 .",
    "* co emission : * required @xmath1 jy km s@xmath2 to ensure clear detection by the interferometer .",
    "out of the 80 pairs in @xcite , eight pairs meet this selection criteria .",
    "five sources ( vv  48 , vv  247 , vv  769 , vv  242 , vv  244 ) were observed in co  ( 10 ) using the ovro in spring 2002 , two sources ( vv  246 , vv  254 ) were observed during the 19971998 season , and the final source ( vv  253 ) was observed in spring 1995 and the data were retrieved from the ovro archive . in addition to the eight sources selected from the @xcite sample , three pairs that satisfy the same selection criteria ( vv  219 , vv  55 , vv  254 ) were observed at the ovro array .",
    "vv  219 was observed in spring 2002 , while both vv  55 and vv  254 were observed during the 19971998 season .",
    "observation of vv  246 ( ngc  3395/6 ) resulted in a non - detection by the interferometer , despite the reported flux of 58  jy  km  s@xmath2 ( ngc  3395 ) and 39  jy  km  s@xmath2 ( ngc  3396 ) obtained using the nrao  12  m telescope @xcite .",
    "the non - detection result of vv  246 is not presented here .",
    "this will comprise an interferometric co  ( 10 ) sample of a total of 10 pairs ( or 20 galaxies)(see table  [ galaxy_sample ] )  a large enough of a sample to allow the full examination of the large parameter space involved .",
    "five of these sources ( vv  55 , vv  253 , vv  242 , vv  219 , vv  244 ) were also observed in emission using the vla in winter 2002 .",
    "the data for three sources ( vv  48 , vv  247 , vv  731 ) were obtained from the vla archive , while the maps of vv  254 and vv  769 were kindly supplied by j. condon .    to place the characteristics of the sample sources in a broader context , a first order assessment of the merger chronology",
    "is performed by sorting the sample systems according to their projected nuclear separation ( table  [ galaxy_sample ] and figure  [ dss_all ] ) .",
    "this classification scheme is similar to the method adopted by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* i.e. the toomre sequence ) where eleven colliding / merging galaxy pairs from various stages of the interaction were selected from the ngc catalog , and the optical morphology of the pairs were used to roughly define the interaction sequence . classifying the interacting galaxies in this way can introduce significant uncertainties because the sample sources are predominantly early to intermediate stage systems , whereas the toomre sequence covers a much broader range of interacting systems from the early stage ( `` the antennae ( ngc  4038/9 ) '' ) to the late stage merger ( `` atoms for peace ( ngc  7252 ) '' ) .",
    "this ordering will be revised in paper  iii from a different perspective using a more comprehensive and quantitative set of analysis tools derived from the global properties in optical , co  ( 10 ) and emission .    in order to investigate the environment in which each galaxy pair resides , the projected 2  mpc radius of each pair was searched for the presence of neighboring galaxies using the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "constraining the velocity range according to the hubble law will only include sources in a narrow velocity space ( i.e. @xmath17 km s@xmath2 for 2  mpc using @xmath18 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 ) , and it will likely preclude galaxies with high peculiar velocities with respect to the hubble flow . to be conservative ,",
    "therefore , the adopted velocity range includes galaxies within @xmath19 km s@xmath2 of the systemic velocity .",
    "the results are presented in table  [ environment ] .",
    "the ned only includes galaxies that exist in previous survey catalogs and may not have the faint dwarf companions that past instruments were not capable of detecting due to sensitivity or coverage limitations .",
    "for example , the all sky 2mass catalog @xcite and the sdss @xcite has a sensitivity limit of @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "excluding such faint undetected dwarf galaxies which are predicted to be abundant , half of the program sources ( vv  55 , vv  48 , vv  253 , vv  219 , vv  244 ) appear to reside in a high density environment as the large number of neighboring sources indicates . vv  219 is an interacting system in the virgo cluster and therefore has an exceptionally large number of neighbors . the rest of the systems ( vv  254 , vv  247 , vv  769 , vv  242 , vv  731 ) have about a factor of ten smaller number ( @xmath22 ) of neighboring sources , which suggests that the evolution is determined mostly from the companion galaxy in the respective galaxy systems .",

    "the origin of the apparent discrepancy between the single dish and the interferometer is unclear .",
    "it may be attributed to the uncertainties in the amplitude calibration , or to spurious features in the interferometer map due to the uncertainties in gain calibration or potential erroneous data that were undetected during data editing .",
    "regardless of the underlying cause for the discrepancy , it is imperative to bear in mind that spatial filtering always exists in interferometric data , and interpretation of the qualitative and quantitative analysis should be treated with caution .",
    "another possible source of uncertainty is the use of the galactic co - h@xmath120 conversion to estimate the molecular gas mass .",
    "it has been suggested that the galactic co - h@xmath120 conversion can overestimate the molecular gas mass by as large as factor 4 - 5 @xcite in the nuclear starburst regions in lirgs / ulirgs .",
    "many of our sample systems are undergoing moderate star formation activity ( 2 - 30  m@xmath129 @xmath130 ) .",

    "the observed brightness temperature for the emission is related to the spin temperature by the optical depth and filling factor as @xmath131 \\approx f t_s \\tau$ ] for @xmath132 .",
    "it is possible that an edge - on galaxy could appear to have a larger optical depth than a face - on galaxy due to a longer line of sight .",
    "however , since the above measurement relies on the peak flux obtained in a narrow velocity channel , the optically thin approximation should hold true and will not introduce significant uncertainties in the derived temperature .",
    "the emission emerging from a narrow velocity channel can be comprised of blended emission from several overlapping cloud components with different temperature .",
    "the estimated spin temperature of t@xmath133  @xmath12  k in a simple 3-cloud model is relatively insensitive to the adopted cloud densities in the optically thin limit ( see appendix ) .",

    "the atomic gas mass ranges from @xmath140 to @xmath141 - a range of over one order of magnitude between the collision of two low mass galaxies ( vv  244 ) and the massive major merger of vv  55 ( figure  [ mh2_mhi ]  ( @xmath142 ) ) .",

    "on the other hand , the mass correlates poorly with @xmath148 , possibly because a variety of morphological types are included in the sample .",

    "they further note that their mean @xmath153 ratios are about a factor of 2 smaller than those calculated from the @xmath152 listed in @xcite , citing differences in the methods to determine the single dish co luminosities as the primary reason for the observed discrepancies .",
    "the @xmath152 in our sample are not particularly high ( @xmath154  @xmath151 or @xmath155  @xmath151 ; see table  6 ) , and they are generally similar to those derived for the isolated and weakly interacting galaxies in ( * ? ? ?",

    "a short discussion of each feature and the galaxies identified are presented in what follows .",
    "n - body simulations of galaxy interactions suggest that ejection of cold disk gas at large radii , primarily neutral hydrogen , into tidal tails is a ubiquitous phenomenon .",
    "the degree of ejection depends crucially on the encounter geometry ( see * ? ? ?",
    "tidal ejection is expected to occur to some degree even in an orbital geometry that is the least favorable to transfer energy and angular momentum ( i.e. a retrograde encounter ) .",
    "long and well defined tidal tails are unlikely to form in such an event . inspecting the size and the amplitude of the tidal tails , therefore , offers a unique way to infer the orbital geometry @xcite . out of the nine systems with high quality maps , five ( vv  55 , vv  253 , vv  247 , vv  731 , vv  244 ) display long tidal tails ( i.e. @xmath182 ) suggesting that at least one of the disks involved is in a prograde orbit ( table  [ morph_prop ] ) .",
    "the highly inclined geometry complicates the analysis in vv  242 despite hints of tails seen at the edges of both disks .",
    "it is not surprising to find that about 50% of the sources are in a prograde orbit since there are two equally possible disk orientations , unless the encounter geometry is such that it is a head - on collision similar to the `` cartwheel galaxy ( vv  784 ) '' .",
    "the occurrence of a long  tail appears to coincide with the elevated level of infrared emission  out of the five systems with long  tails , four ( 80% ) are classified as lirgs .",
    "correlation between other morphological properties with infrared activity appears to be relatively insignificant ( see table  [ morph_prop ] ) .",
    "a strong perturbation from a prograde orbit can lead to efficient ejection of the outer disk gas into tidal tails , while the inward propagating waves can compress and heat the inner disk gas , simultaneously inducing intense star formation activity there . while the presence of a long  tail may infer the interaction history and the increased bursts of star formation in a collision of gas - rich progenitor galaxies",
    ", it is possible that the strength of the interaction and the associated infrared activity are correlated with other important physical parameters .",
    "these include , for example , the temperature of the dust @xcite and/or the presence of the nuclear agn .",
    "it is , however , suggested that agn dominated galaxies constitute only of order ( 12)% of the infrared luminous galaxy population @xcite .",
    "further discussion on this apparent correlation will be conducted in paper  iii .    a recent , strong head - on collision can lead to a substantial amount of radio continuum emission in the medium between the two galaxies as seen in the two taffy systems ( see  7 ,  8.3 , ",
    "a long stretched morphology is also seen in the  emission in these galaxies .",
    "therefore , substantial  emission in the medium between the two galaxies may signify a strong and recent encounter . by searching for systems in which the @xmath183  @xmath184 contours are connected between the two galaxies , nearly 80% ( 7/9 ) of the systems",
    "show visual evidence of such feature .",
    "this may be a slight overestimate as the line of sight projection can significantly impact the apparent  morphology in some cases ( i.e. vv  242 , vv  244 ) . in paper",
    "iii , this feature will be used as one of the important criteria to define the merger chronology of the sample .",
    "a transient and inelastic response of the gas is particularly noticeable during the initial stages of a disk - disk collision in numerical simulations , sometimes resulting in a strong asymmetry in the gas distribution ( see paper  i ) .",
    "in addition to the displacement of the co peaks from the stellar light ( see below ) , a significant displacement of  peaks from the stellar disks is also seen among six ( vv  244 , vv  247 , vv  253 , vv  254 , vv  731 and vv  769 ) of the systems .",
    "such displacements are generally not expected since gas and stellar structures inside the tidal radius should remain unaffected by a tidal disruption . a pre - existing asymmetry or a central hole in the gas distribution prior the recent collision may account for the observed displacement in some cases .",
    "an inelastic gaseous collision is primarily responsible for the gas morphology in the two `` taffy '' systems ( vv  254 and vv  769 ) , and it may play an important role in shaping the gas distribution in many of the other systems as well .    in general , a smooth and continuous distribution of co  ( 10 ) in the disk is seen , but clumpy distributions are evident in a few sources that are gas poor ( ugc  12914 , ugc  816 , ngc  4567 , ngc  5395 ) .",
    "co  ( 10 ) emission is fully resolved spatially with at least 3 synthesized beams across the stellar disks in all cases , widely extended with respect to the r - band emission at the column density of @xmath163 @xmath184 .",
    "this is in a stark contrast to the observations of ir luminous , more advanced interaction / merger systems whose co emission is typically characterized by a compact ( @xmath185 kpc ) nuclear concentration centered on the local minima in gravitational potential @xcite .",
    "the peak of the co  ( 10 ) emission does not coincide with the dynamical center of the galaxy determined from k - band emission in ngc  5395 , ngc  5258 , ugc  12914 , or ngc  5331n .",
    "there are five co emitting complexes with no optical counterpart ( ugc  12914 , ugc  816 , ngc  5331s , ngc  5954 and ngc  6621 ) .",
    "the true nature of these complexes is yet to be determined , but one possible explanation is the ejection of molecular gas from strong gas - gas collisions during the first pericentric passage .",
    "finally , the galaxy environment seems to play a relatively minor role in the formation and the shaping of the long tails . while previous  observations with much lower surface brightness sensitivity have shown that galaxies in a dense cluster environment harbor less extended atomic gas than galaxies in isolation @xcite , such pattern is not obvious in the current data ( i.e. long tidal tails are seen independent of the environment , with a possible exception of vv  219 in virgo ) .",

    "the northern and western side of the galaxy are almost devoid of molecular gas .",
    "the velocity field in ngc  5953 appears to follow a normal circular rotation where the velocity increases from the northeast to the southwest .",

    "the pvd in ngc  5953 ( figure  [ pvd3 ] ) is significantly lopsided toward the upper left quadrant , with low velocity features covering a larger extent ( @xmath303  kpc ) .",

    "the pvd in ngc  5954 is similarly lopsided toward the lower right quadrant , but the co pvd appears to trace a circular rotation .",
    "similar to ngc  5953 , the and co rotation curves do not agree exactly and are offset by @xmath306  km s@xmath2(figure  [ rot3 ] ) , possibly due to tidal stripping of the disk  gas .",
    "atomic and molecular gases are the dominant constituents of the ism in galaxies , and tidal perturbations from a companion of comparable mass can significantly alter the distribution and kinematics , leading to compression , inflow , and enhanced star formation activities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as an observational test of such a theoretical scenario , we have identified a sample of 10 pairs of nearly equal mass large disk galaxies in their early stages of interaction or merger and obtained new or archival and co  ( 10 ) data using the vla and the ovro millimeter array for the entire sample .",

    "more than half of the sources have higher molecular gas mass than atomic gas , and this may suggest the dominance of molecular gas in these colliding galaxies . 2 .   *",
    "distribution of the emission : * emission in 50% of the sample sources display long tails , indicative of at least one of the galaxies in the pair following a prograde orbit .",
    "four out of five ( 80% ) systems with long  tails are classified as lirgs , suggesting a correlation between tidal disruption of outer gas and disk star formation activity .",
    "the @xmath311  @xmath184 column density contours in nearly 80% of the sources are connected between the two galaxies involved in the collision ( i.e. taffy like sources ) .",
    "the environment does not appear to have a significant impact on the development of these large tidal features .",
    "the peaks are offset from the stellar light distribution in six of the groups ( vv  244 vv  247 , vv  253 , vv  254 , vv  731 , and vv  769 ; 60% ) .",
    "* distribution of the co  ( 10 ) emission : * the co  ( 10 ) emission peak in four galaxies ( ngc  5258 , ngc  5331n , ngc  5395 , and ugc  12914 ; i.e. @xmath268% ) is offset from the dynamical center of the galaxy determined from the 2mass k - band images .",
    "there are five co  ( 10 ) emission complexes with no optical counterpart ( ugc  12914 , ugc  816 , ngc  5331s , ngc  5954 and ngc  6621 ; i.e. @xmath312% of the galaxies ) .",
    "* position velocity diagrams : * more than 50% of the sources in co  ( 10 ) shows a central hole at the pvd centroid , and this is indicative of an existence of a central gas ring .",
    "at least 10% of the sources show substantial co  ( 10 ) emission in the forbidden velocity quadrant which is a possible evidence of radial inflow ( paper  i ) .",
    "* rotation curves : * out of the 15 galaxies with robust derivation of the and co  ( 10 ) rotation curves , five galaxies ( @xmath313% ; ngc  5395 , ugc  813 , ugc  816 , ngc  5953 , ngc  5954 ) shows significant departure ( @xmath314  km  s@xmath2 ) between the and co rotation curves .",
    "this may be explained by the fact that molecular gas in general has a clumpy distribution with a lower filling factor than , and that the loosely bound disk  gas is tidally ejected .",
    "the derived physical properties , distribution , and kinematics of the gas were presented in this paper in order to build a statistically significant sample of gas in colliding systems .",

    "this models a simple cloud structure in a disk , and it is motivated by the observed evidence that the scale height of the wnm is about twice as large as that of the cm in the galaxy . therefore , assuming a face on galaxy , the emission from the far side of the galaxy ( cloud 3 ) goes through the cm ( cloud 2 ) , then through the wnm ( cloud 1 ) and arrives at the observer . the emerging brightness temperature at the observer can be expressed as , @xmath315 e^{-\\tau_1}.\\ ] ] the blended brightness temperature can then be converted to spin temperature assuming @xmath316",

    "<S> we present and co  ( 10 ) interferometric observations of 10 comparable - mass interacting systems obtained at the very large array ( vla ) and the owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) millimeter array . </S>",
    "<S> the primary intent of this study is to investigate the response of cold gas during the early stages of collision of massive disk galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the sample sources are selected based on their luminosity ( m@xmath0 ) , projected separation ( 5 - 40 kpc ) , and single dish co  ( 10 ) content ( @xmath1 jy km s@xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these selection criteria result in a sample that primarily consists of systems in the early stages of an interaction or a merger . despite this sample selection , </S>",
    "<S> 50% of the systems show long tidal tails indicative of a tidal disruption in a prograde orbit . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , all ( 4/4 ) of the infrared luminous pairs ( lirgs ) in the sample show long  tails , suggesting that the presence of a long  tail can be a possible signature of enhanced star formation activity in a collision of gas - rich galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> more than half of the groups show a displacement of  peaks from the stellar disks . </S>",
    "<S> the co  ( 10 ) distribution is generally clumpy and widely distributed , unlike in most ir - selected late stage mergers  in fact , co peaks are displaced from the stellar nucleus in 20% ( 4/18 ) of the galaxies with robust co detection .  and co  ( 10 ) position velocity diagrams ( pvds ) and rotation curves are also presented , and their comparison with the numerical simulation analyzed in paper  i show evidence for radial inflow and wide occurrences of nuclear molecular rings . </S>",
    "<S> these results are further quantified by examining physical and structural parameters derived in comparison with isolated systems in the bima song sample in our forthcoming paper . </S>"
