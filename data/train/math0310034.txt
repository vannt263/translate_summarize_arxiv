    "we stabilize this legendrian circle once .",
    "this gives a thickened torus @xmath410 $ ] with convex boundary such that @xmath411 , which has two dividing curves of slope @xmath19 , and @xmath412 has two dividing curves of slope @xmath413 . since we can choose the sign of the stabilization , we can make the sign of this basic slice @xmath315 .",
    "since @xmath414 , we can find tori @xmath415 and @xmath416 in @xmath410 $ ] parallel to the boundary such that @xmath415 has two dividing curves of slope @xmath379 , and @xmath416 has two dividing curves of slope @xmath59 .",
    "note that @xmath417 $ ] is now a continued fraction block consisting of @xmath380 basic slices of the sign @xmath315 .",
    "now use @xmath416 to thicken @xmath418 $ ] to @xmath371 $ ] such that @xmath419=t_2 \\times [ \\frac{1}{2},\\frac{3}{4}]$ ] , and @xmath372 has two vertical dividing curves . note that @xmath420 $ ] is a continued fraction block that contains at least @xmath142 basic slices of the sign @xmath315 .",
    "now , similar to case 1 , we can find a contradiction .",
    "thus , @xmath335 $ ] can not contain @xmath402 basic slices of the sign @xmath315 either .",
    "but @xmath335 $ ] contains @xmath380 basic slices .",
    "so either @xmath142 of these are of the sign @xmath317 , or @xmath402 of these are of the sign @xmath315 .",
    "this is a contradiction .",
    "thus , no such @xmath1 exists on @xmath3 , and , hence , we proved part ( 3 ) of theorem [ -1 ] .",
    "when a seifert space @xmath3 has more than @xmath2 singular fibers , or the base surface has genus @xmath421 , there exists a vertical incompressible torus @xmath126 embedded in @xmath3 . using this vertical incompressible torus @xmath126 , we can construct infinitely many pairwise non - isomorphic universally tight contact structure on @xmath3 .",
    "( see @xcite for more details . ) for infinitely many universally tight contact structures constructed this way , there is a tubular neighborhood @xmath422 of @xmath126 in @xmath3 that has @xmath133-twisting equal to @xmath134 .",
    "in such a neighborhood , we can always find a convex torus @xmath423 isotopic to @xmath126 whose dividing set consists of vertical circles . by the legendrian realization principle",
    ", we can realize a vertical circle on @xmath423 disjoint from the dividing set as a legendrian curve .",
    "this legendrian curve is a vertical legendrian circle with twisting number @xmath19 .",
    "so any such `` larger '' seifert space admit tight contact structures for which there exists a legendrian vertical circle with twisting number @xmath19 .    using theorem [ -2 ] and ghiggini and schnenberger s result that , when @xmath33 , no tight contact structures on the small seifert space @xmath34 admit legendrian vertical circles with twisting number @xmath19 , one can easily prove that the brieskorn homology spheres @xmath424 do not admit tight contact structures for which there exists legendrian vertical circles with twisting number @xmath19 .",
    "it s certainly very interesting to see if this is true for all small brieskorn homology spheres .",
    "unfortunately , theorem [ -1 ] is not strong enough to apply to this case .",
    "we will have to develop new techniques before we can tackles this problem .",
