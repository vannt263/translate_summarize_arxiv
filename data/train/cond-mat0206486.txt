    "let us consider an electron in a periodic one dimensional chain of atoms modelled by the potential constituted by an array of @xmath0 delta functions each one with its own coupling @xmath3 , ( @xmath4 ) .",

    "the number of _ species _ @xmath0 , can be arbitrarily large but finite .",
    "the case @xmath0=1 is an old textbook exercise but may be convenient to be revisited @xcite for taking a full profit of our general results .",
    "the generalization can thus be followed in a more straightforward manner .",

    "one can equally write the correspondent matrix in the form : @xmath9 where in all of the above cases , we have used the notation : @xmath10 and we shall also be using the _ length _ of each species , defined as : @xmath11 one can now proceed to the generalization of the matrix form for general number @xmath0 of species just by defining the following @xmath12 matrices : @xmath13 0.3 cm the matrices for @xmath5 and @xmath8 species given by and can now be put in a more compact form with the help of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 as : @xmath16    it is now relatively simple to guess that the general form of a matrix for @xmath0 species must be written as : @xmath17    so far nothing very exciting has happened except that one can write the matrices in a compact , logic and generalizable way . and",
    "in fact without further steps the progress would have not been certainly remarkable .",
    "the real breakthrough arises when one realizes that one has to deal with the * determinants equated to zero of these matrices * in order to learn something about the * band condition of this one dimensional n - species quantum periodic structure*. let us define the following function @xmath18 : takes pure imaginary values that we represent in the figures in the negative part of the spectrum ] @xmath19 a quite simple computer algebra calculation shows that the determinant equated to zero of , which belongs to the @xmath5 case , can be written in terms of these functions as @xmath20 and the determinant of the @xmath8 matrix given by can also be calculated to yield : @xmath21 below , the cases @xmath22 and 7 are explicitely listed , using the generalized matrix for each case and calculating the determinant equated to zero with the help of the @xmath23 functions .",
    "the result is : @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27    we have been able to proof by induction that the general form of the @xmath0 species case can be given as : @xmath28    * @xmath0 * even * + * @xmath0 * odd * +    all what remains is to define the symbol @xmath29 which means the _ sum of all possible products of m different @xmath30 s with the following rule for each product : the indices must follow an increasing order and to an odd index must always follow an even index and reciprocally . _",
    "the band structure provided by and is not just * exact * but also extremely useful from the point of view of computer algebra calculations .",
    "in fact we have carried out various profiles for the curves provided for these conditions until @xmath0=30 or more using just few seconds of a lap - top regular computer .",
    "the reason for that lies mainly in the systematic use of the form , products and combinations of the @xmath23-function defined by . as examples of what has just been said we list in fig .",
    "[ fig : six ] and [ fig : ten ] a series of band curves for large number of species and various values of the parameter @xmath31 , defining the characteristic value of the @xmath23-function .",
    "one can observe also the unpredictable set of allowed bands which appear at low energies .",
    "this pattern increases its unpredictibility with the number of species .",
    "once the band condition is known , one can write the distribution of electronic states in a very simple form . in one dimension the density of states per unit length of the chain for the n@xmath32 band comes from , @xmath33 where the sum is over all the first brillouin zone ( 1bz ) points @xmath34 with the same energy @xmath35 . due to the parity of @xmath36",
    "the number of points with the same value of @xmath35 in the 1bz is always 2 , and provided that overlapping of neighbouring bands is not possible in this system , we can write the density of states as @xmath37 inside the permitted bands . from a trivial calculation",
    "leads to , @xmath38^{-\\frac{1}{2}}}{n\\pi}\\bigg|\\frac{d\\mathcal{b}(\\epsilon)}{d\\epsilon}\\bigg|\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the density of electronic states per atom .",
    "[ fig : den ] shows some examples of the characteristic form of the distribution of states for different configurations of the primitive cell .",
    "the structures one can observe in nature hardly show a perfect periodicity . even in the laboratory",
    "it is a difficult task to grow a crystal free of impurities , vacancies or dislocations .",
    "we shall now treat the presence of substitutional disorder in one dimensional delta - potential chains , that is we consider a chain of equally spaced deltas in which the sequence of different species does not obey a periodic pattern .",
    "this model has been mainly studied regarding the vibrational spectrum @xcite , paying less attention to its electronic density of states @xcite . for the purpose of studying quantum wires the relevant behaviour",
    "we want to analyze lies more in the latter than in the former physical property .      the saxon and hutner conjecture @xcite was proved by luttinger for the case of binary chains @xcite .",
    "we have been able to extend it to the general case .",
    "a detailed calculation following the line of schmidt @xcite can be found in appendix [ ap : gaps ] .",
    "the result can be easily summarized as follows : * the forbidden bands that coincide in different one species delta chains with couplings @xmath40 are also forbidden levels in any infinite chain made up of deltas of the @xmath0 types . *",
    "this conclusion can be applied to both disordered and periodic chains . as can be seen in the calculations",
    "the result requires the interatomic distances of the chains involved to be constant and the same for all of them .",
    "let us calculate the allowed energy levels of a finite non - periodic chain of deltas with fixed end - points boundary conditions .",
    "the procedure to follow is the same as for the periodic case but imposing the vanishing of the wave function at the end - points of the chain which we locate at one atomic distance to the left of the first delta and to the right of the last one .",
    "the connection of the wave function throughout the different sectors leads us to a condition for the permitted energy levels in the form of the determinant of a matrix equated to zero .",
    "again these matrices can be written in a generalizable way .",
    "thus for @xmath0 deltas we have @xmath41 whith @xmath14 and @xmath15 defined in and @xmath42 we found the condition to be factorizable in terms of the functions @xmath43 in a similar manner to that of the periodic chain .",
    "the eigenenergies of the system are the roots of : @xmath44 where    * @xmath0 * even * + * @xmath0 * odd * +    and here the symbol @xmath45 means the _ sum of all possible products of m different @xmath30 s with the following rule for each product : the first index has to be odd , the indices must follow an increasing order and to an odd index must always follow an even index and reciprocally . _    from we see that @xmath46 , are always eigenvalues of any finite length disordered chain wathever the species in it .",
    "the basic assumption concerning the electronic energies of a random chain is that the distribution of levels converges to a limiting distribution as the number of atoms goes to infinity , which is the same for almost all atomic sequences ( except for a fraction that goes to zero as @xmath47 ) as long as the concentrations of the different species remain fixed .",
    "the existence of this property is needed by the thermodynamic limit : all quantities charaterizing macroscopically a random infinite chain with fixed species and concentrations can not depend on the order of any finite - length piece of it .",
    "the method used to obtain the density of states in random chains is essentially due to james and ginzbarg @xcite and schmidt @xcite , who derived a functional equation which supplies the limiting distribution for the positive part of the spectrum .",
    "we have reconstructed and extended the method to provide the density of states for all energies ( appendix [ ap : functional ] ) .",
    "the functional equation is ,    [ ec : w ] @xmath48    where @xmath49 $ ] and @xmath50 is the number of species composing the chain , @xmath51 the @xmath52th species concentration and @xmath53 are the functions , @xmath54 with @xmath55 defined in . solving for different values of the energy , the density of electronic states per atom",
    "can be obtained from , @xmath56 where @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "we solve this equation numerically .",
    "the range of @xmath58 is discretized in @xmath59 equally spaced points and @xmath60 is represented by its values at those points which using a selfconsistent algorithm we have been able to calculate up to an error of @xmath61 .",
    "some examples of distributions of random chains are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dens ] .",
    "the most interesting feature of the different spectra is the localized peak structure that appears for certain energy intervals .",
    "those irregularities had been reported several years ago @xcite@xcite and now the extremely accurate numerical algorithms dramatically confirm .",
    "although the general interpretation of the behaviour of the distributions for these systems is non trivial one can say as a general rule ( and following the suggestion of agacy and borland @xcite ) that the peaked regions are remarkable in ranges of the spectrum which are forbidden for some of the species involved but not for all of them since in this latter case the range is also not allowed for the random system .",
    "a clear view of this explanation can be obtained by looking at a random chain of two species a and b. in a region forbidden for the a - type chain the allowed energies appearing in the spectrum are due to atomic clusters involving b atoms . as a result the a atoms surrounding these groups isolate those energies causing the density of states to decrease when we move in a tiny region around each of the levels and therefore giving rise to a fluctuating distribution .",
    "thus one could reproduce the energies where the density of states would be more prominent , from the eigenvalues of certain atomic clusters in which the b species have a substantial contribution as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : clusters ] . in the ( a ) example it is clear how the eigenstates clusterize around the more peaked regions of the distribution .",
    "however one needs to consider a huge number of clusters in order to reproduce all the maxima due to the equal concentrations of the species . decreasing the b concentration we see in ( b )",
    "how the sharp points can be quite easily predicted .",
    "another feature that can be seen in the different representations in fig .",
    "[ fig : dens ] , is how the distribution approaches a smoother curve that resembles the one corresponding to a periodic chain as the energy grows : the greater the electron s energy the less it feels the presence of disorder .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:3d ] , the evolution of the density of states can be observed for a pure one species chain as we dope substitutionally with atoms of a different kind .      since anderson @xcite the disorder in the structures has been accepted as the main effect responsible of the spatial localization of the eigenstates of the systems .",
    "just few years ago it was shown how if the disorder is correlated the localization can be suppressed for certain energies @xcite@xcite . in 1999 the first experimental evidence that correlations inhibit localization of states in disordered low - dimensional systems was reported @xcite .",
    "let us check the degree of localization for the electronic states in random chains with positive energy .",
    "what we specifically calculate is the average logarithmic decay per atom of the square of the envelope of the real wave function which seems an adequate quantity for such a characterization @xcite .    in the @xmath62th sector",
    "we write : @xmath63 and we look for : @xmath64 the connection equations of the wave function at the borders of the different sectors imply : @xmath65 again , we will be using the functional equation to carry out the calculation so using the phase @xmath66 as in the appendix [ ap : functional ] , it is just a matter of algebra to obtain : @xmath67 and the same arguments apearing on the appendix lead us to write as @xmath68 integrating by parts and using the equations for @xmath69 , we finally obtain : @xmath70 in the fig .  [",
    "fig : loca ] some examples of the degree of localization as a function of the energy are shown .    as can be seen the degree of localization",
    "has a tendency to decrease in the peaks of the spectrum and increase in the troughs , and for @xmath71 the states are always extended for any chain .",
    "this last result had been already obtained using the trasfer matrix technique @xcite for finite chains .",
    "so the system with completely uncorrelated disorder can support extented states .",
    "in fact an infinite number of isolated resonances is present altough mobility edge for the electrons does not exist and therefore one can not speak of an anderson transition in a strict sense for this particularly simple model .",
    "let us observe the peaked regions of the distributions . at first sight",
    "the irregularities make the density of states appear hardly differentiable within those intervals .",
    "would this pattern still hold as we look deeper into the distribution ?",
    "is the distribution non differentiable ? in order to answer these questions one has to improve the numerical calculation to be able to see the real density of states in smaller energy ranges . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fractal ] the spectrum of a certain random chain is shown for shorter and shorter energy intervals .    as can be seen as the energy domain is made smaller and",
    "thus increasing the accuracy of the numerical algorithm the distribution reveals a finer structure : new sharp points appear and the density does not evolve smoothly .",
    "we have been extremely careful with the numerical algorithms and we are pretty sure that the observed irregularities are not due to numerical errors . for the representations in fig .",
    "[ fig : fractal ] we have proceeded doubling the number of points taken for @xmath58 in order to represent the functional equation and checking the convergence of the density of states at each step until the desired accuracy ( in all cases the average variation of @xmath39 in the last step relative to its domain was less than 0.75% ) .",
    "the final parameters were :    c c c & points for @xmath58 & @xmath72 + fig .",
    "[ fig : fractal ] ( a ) & 5001 & @xmath73 + fig .",
    "[ fig : fractal ] ( b ) & 35001 & @xmath74 + fig .",
    "[ fig : fractal ] ( c ) & 150001 & @xmath75 +   +    as a final check we repeated the procedure for the same random chain , with the same paremeters but in an apparently smooth region of the density of states obtaining the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nofractal ] . from this",
    "we can see that the irregularities in certain intervals of the spectrum are not due to errors of the numerical computation .",
    "the numerical calculation of the density of states suggests the possibility for the distributions to show a quasi - fractal behaviour in some energy ranges : non differentiability for any point inside these regions and irregular aspect whatever the scale .",
    "the differentiability of the distribution is a consequence of a regular ( almost homogeneous ) distribution of the states inside a small energy interval .",
    "a clear view of the differences between the way in which states appear inside an irregular region and a smooth region of the density can be obtained representing the energy spaces for adjacent levels . in fig .",
    "[ fig : niveles ] these spacing distributions are shown for the first 100 levels that appear inside an irregular zone and a smooth one .",
    "increasing the length of the random chain we see how the spacing distribution for the levels in the smooth region becomes more and more homogeneous as the first 100 levels are included in a smaller energy interval while the spacings for the levels in the irregular zone does not show a defined tendency nor a homogeneus distribution . in fact these last spacing distributions exhibit the same aspect whatever the scale would be .",
    "the fractality of the density of states does not depend on any particular parameter of the random chain ; its presence is a consequence of the disorder and the dimensionality of the system and it is in this sense a universal effect .",
    "this fractal behaviour might be related to the fractal conductance fluctuations observed in gold nanowires @xcite in the mesoscopic regime suggesting a connection between disorder and coherent transport .",
    "to summarize we would like to point out the main results we have obtained in this paper .",
    "first , we emphasize that the band structure provided by - is not just * exact * but also extremely useful from the point of view of computer algebra calculations .",
    "in fact we have carried out various profiles for the curves provided for these conditions until @xmath0=30 or more using just few seconds of a lap - top regular computer .",
    "the reason for that lies mainly in the systematic use of the form , products and combinations of the @xmath23-function defined by .",
    "the luttinger theorem has been generalized to an arbitrary number of different delta potentials and the saxon - hutner conjecture has also been definitively established .",
    "similar expressions have been obtained for the case of a disordered finite chain and the extended functional equation method has been used to look specifically to the density of electronic states for a random infinite array . by obtaining the degree of localization of the electronic states in the random chains , we have a more complete picture of the role the levels play in the transport processes and the existence of extended states under uncorrelated disorder has been confirmed .",
    "the results are not only in agreement with what was expected in more sophisticated models but also go beyond them and we can account for universal properties of the transport effects by detecting fractality in the conductance .",
    "this work is far from being finished as we want to ascertain ourselves whether this effect can be measurable in terms of the fractal dimension and critical exponents . at the moment , however , we can already offer a large bundle of properties that arise from a model whose simplicity is not only a shortcoming but rather an advantange to study complex properties in a benchproof easily manageable .",
    "let us consider a finite chain of @xmath0 delta potentials of different species with fixed end - points boundary conditions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : box ] ) . inside the @xmath62th sector",
    "we write the wave function of the electron @xmath76 where @xmath77 .    imposing the conditions at the border",
    "@xmath78 one can obtain the relationship between the amplitudes of adjacent sectors : @xmath79 and @xmath80 is the transmission matrix of the sectors .",

    "now let us consider the values of @xmath91 satisfying @xmath92 for every @xmath93 in the chain ( i.e. the common forbidden bands for all the one species chains ) .",
    "as @xmath94 it is easy to proof by induction using that @xmath95 .",
    "so we have @xmath96 for arbitrary @xmath0 and the final boundary condition can not be satisfied whatever the length of the chain",
    ". therefore those @xmath91 values are not allowed in the mixed chain .",
    "notice that the order in which the different species appear is irrelevant .",
    "the same conclusion holds for both periodic and disordered chains .",
    "the result is also valid for complex values of @xmath97 ( i.e. negative energies ) .",
    "the limiting distribution of electronic states for a random chain composed of @xmath50 different species each one with concentration @xmath51 , will be given by the average of the spectra for all sequences which have the given concentrations in the limit as the number of atoms goes to infinity .",
    "let us consider the same chain as in the appendix [ ap : gaps ] and the quantities @xmath98 . since @xmath99 and the transmission is real every @xmath98 will also be real and we can define a phase in each sector @xmath66 so that @xmath100 , which yields the result : @xmath101 we need the transmission of the phase to be an increasing continuous function",

    ". then if @xmath106 the quantity @xmath107 is the number of times the final boundary condition has been satisfied from @xmath108 to @xmath109 with an error smaller than 1 and therefore it also represents the number of eigenstates in the interval @xmath110 .",

    "<S> as the main interest of almost all of these authors was band theory , the techniques used in all these papers were mainly addressed to semiconductor physics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> much more recently a revival of the same models and techniques @xcite has arisen as a consequence of the interest in truly theoretical and experimental one - dimensional physical systems from which quantum wires are just only one example @xcite . right now </S>",
    "<S> the research in molecular conductances , one - dimensional metallic rings and other devices of the same sort lends support to the idea of generalizing old methods yielding exact analitic solutions coupled to the use of desk - top computer algebra .    here </S>",
    "<S> firstly we shall solve analitically the band structure of * an infinite periodic chain of delta potentials each one with a different coupling inside the primitive cell * paying mostly attention to the mathematical aspects . </S>",
    "<S> after studing the band structure of the chain one can introduce randomness boosted by quantum fluctuations in order to account for localization . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately the model seems rich enough to yield more information such as the generalization of the saxon - hutner conjecture @xcite and even scaling exhibited as fractal behaviour of the conductance @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the paper will be organized as follows . in section </S>",
    "<S> i we shall present the analytic solution of * the periodic case * of infinite different delta potentials . </S>",
    "<S> the band structure of this one dimensional periodic potential will also be briefly discussed . in section </S>",
    "<S> ii we turn our attention to the case of * random arrays * of one dimensional delta potentials with different couplings . </S>",
    "<S> here we discuss the density of states using the functional equation method and classify the different types of localization appearing when disorder is present . </S>",
    "<S> as we have been able to increase our understanding of localization to the extent of detecting universality effects , we shall entirely devote the section iii to the discussion of fractality in the conductance and the different checkings we have managed to perform in order to ascertain ourselves and try to convince the reader that the effect is present even in this extremely simple model . </S>",
    "<S> we close with a section of conclusions . </S>"
