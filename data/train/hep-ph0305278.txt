    "recently , some efforts have been made to improve their theoretical application .",

    "@xmath14 describes the four - quark operator and the quark pair from the sea connected by a hard gluon whose scale is at the order of @xmath21 , so the @xmath14 can be perturbatively calculated .",

    "the final state mesons are moving very fast .",
    "the soft final states interaction may not be important in the two - body @xmath3 meson decays .",
    "the pqcd approach based on @xmath1 factorization theorem is applicable to the calculation of b meson decays .    in this work , we calculate the @xmath107 decay in the pqcd approach .",
    "since neither of quarks in @xmath30 appeared in the final state mesons , this process occurs only via annihilation type diagrams . from our pqcd work ,",
