    "in past years the special attention has been paid to fabrication of graphene quantum dots ( gqds ) @xcite susceptible to be used for magnetic field - controlled spin - electronic logic gates @xcite .",
    "however the origin of magnetism in such structures still remains unclear in spite of number of recent studies of orbital zhang , schnez , potasz , zarenia , grujic , lukbrat and spin ezawa , rossier , wang properties .",
    "this concerns , in particulary , the dependence of magnetic response on the size and on the shape of gqd .",
    "landau diamagnetism in perfect infinite graphene sheet was first studied by mcclure @xcite and more recently in refs .",
    "[ ] , were the singular behavior of susceptibility was found when the fermi energy approaches the dirac point at zero temperature .",
    "this peculiar behavior around zero energy also takes place in the cases when disorder - provided band is present for infinite graphene and ribbons.@xcite on the other hand , the presence of the edge states with energy around zero is a signature of the graphene nanoflakes with various terminations and most notably with the zig - zag edges.@xcite    the number and the properties of edge states are sensitive to the geometry of the gqd.@xcite since diamagnetism of graphene occurs due to the electronic states with the energy near the dirac point , it is natural to assume that the edge states should make a dominant contribution to magnetism of graphene nanoflakes and the geometry of gqd will play an important role in the diamagnetic response of the nanostructure .",
    "in this paper we study the hexagonal , circular , triangular and random gqds and identify two types of the edge states .",
    "first , there are the dispersed edge states ( des ) whose energies are distributed in the range of @xmath0 around the dirac point , with the value of @xmath1 being inversely proportional to the size of the gqd .",
    "secondly , there could be highly degenerate exactly - zero - energy states ( zes ) .",
    "the des are appropriate to the hexagonal , circular and random gqds .",
    "their energies are sensitive to the applied field that induces the edge currents .",
    "these states provides the orbital diamagnetic response of the nanoflakes .",
    "the number of zes , that are mostly present in triangular gqds , can be found exactly from the graph theory @xcite .",
    "their origin is purely geometric and their location does not change as function of the applied magnetic field . therefore zes do not contribute to the diamagnetism of gqds , but they can be occupied by the electrons with unpaired spins and provide the paramagnetism of the system @xcite . studying the edge - state - provided orbital - diamagnetic and spin - paramagnetic response of gqd we predict the possibility of crossover between paramagnetic and diamagnetic response of gqd as a function of their shape , size and temperature .",
    "after this work was completed , we became aware of the preprint ominato2 where the similar research was done .",
    "the main difference between our results is that , we consider the dots of smaller size and at low temperatures @xmath2 , where the edge - states - provided diamagnetic peak is broaden by the size effects and is temperature independent .",
    "[ ] mainly addresses the temperature effects relevant for the gqds with bigger sizes and small values of @xmath3 when diamagnetism is mainly of the bulk origin .",
    "we use the simplest nearest - neighbor tight - binding approximation where the properties of conducting @xmath4-electrons of graphene are described by the hamiltonian @xmath5where @xmath6 , @xmath7 are the creation and annihilation electron operators and @xmath8 is the on - site energy . in what follows we do not consider any on - site disorder and set @xmath9 .",
    "the hopping matrix elements @xmath10 between nearest - neighbor carbon atoms account for the magnetic field via the peierls substitution , @xmath11where @xmath12 is the vector potential of magnetic field and the zero - field hopping was taken as @xmath13 .",
    "the graphene flakes were selected of hexagonal , circular , triangular and random shapes with mostly zig - zag edges .",
    "the contour of the random shape nanostructures has been defined in polar coordinates by : @xmath14   \\label{rrand}\\]]where @xmath15 is the constant average radius that defines the typical size of the flakes , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the random numbers with amplitude not exceeding @xmath18 . in order to have realistic variation of the flake edge on the scale of the lattice constant , the maximum number of harmonics @xmath19 has been chosen to be of the order of @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the lattice constant . typically , this number was about 25 .",
    "direct numerical diagonalization of hamiltonian ( [ htb ] ) gives the field - dependent energy levels @xmath22 and corresponding on - site amplitudes @xmath23 of the wave function .",
    "the orbital energy of the @xmath24-electrons at zero temperature as a function of the chemical potential @xmath25 and magnetic field @xmath26 is given by @xmath27where the factor of 2 is the spin - degeneracy of the levels .",

    "in what follows it will be convenient to distinguish the bulk and the edge electronic states using the following geometrical criterium . for a given state with the energy @xmath31",
    "we ascribe the intensity @xmath32 of the electronic states located within the circle of radius @xmath33 to the _ bulk _ part of the total wave function intensity , whereas the outer part @xmath34 will be due to the _ edge _ contribution .",
    "the radius @xmath33 has been chosen to be about of one lattice constant smaller than the radius of the maximum circle that can be inscribed in a given gqd .",
    "then , the state will be referred to as the edge state if @xmath35 .",
    "otherwise , we refer to it as to the bulk state .",
    "wave functions of the typical edge and bulk states are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "the bulk and the edge states distinguished by the above criterium are also separated in energy .",
    "namely , the edge states normally possess the energy @xmath36 .",
    "we will refer the energy interval of @xmath37 around the dirac point as _ pseudogap_. it turns out that the value of pseudogap is approximately equal for all gqds , characterized by the same inner radius @xmath33 ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the pseudogap scales as @xmath38 .",
    "two types of the edge states can be discerned : ( i ) the zero - energy states ( zes ) that are degenerated and located exactly at @xmath39 , i.e. in the middle of the pseudogap , and ( ii ) the dispersed edge states ( des ) that have the non - zero energies , are symmetrically distributed with respect to @xmath39 , and fill the pseudogap .",
    "as it was shown by the graph - theory @xcite the total number of zes is related to the imbalance between the @xmath40 and @xmath26-type atoms in the graphene flake : @xmath41where the equality is taking place for the geometry of equilateral polygons . for hexagons @xmath42 , there are no zes and all edge states are of the des type .",
    "contrary , for the equilateral triangles all the edge states are of zes type and their degeneracy number is given by @xcite @xmath43usually there are only few zes for circular and randomly shaped gqds .",
    "the number of zes does not depend on magnetic field and therefore these levels do not contribute to the orbital part of susceptibility ( [ sus ] ) .",
    "in contrast , they are responsible for the spin - provided super - paramagnetic response of ensemble of clusters in case of the half - filled @xmath4-band when the fermi energy is pinned at @xmath44 . indeed , according the hund theorem ,",
    "the number of single occupied states of degenerate level should be maximal , providing the total uncompensated spin defined by the lieb s rule rossier , wang @xmath45 that brings the substantial contribution to the temperature - dependent spin - curie paramagnetism .",
    "on the other hand the location of des in hexagonal , circular and random gqddepends on the applied field and therefore these levels are responsible for diamagnetism of graphene clusters , as it is calculated below .",

    "the orbital susceptibility is a highly fluctuating function of the fermi energy that oscillates between paramagnetic and diamagnetic sign .",
    "these oscillations have been recently interpreted for graphene ribbons , as a result of the sub - band structure ominato .    as it was mentioned above , the number of zes for these geometries is vanishingly small that makes the diamagnetic contribution dominant for all sizes .",
    "all the edge states in triangular gqd with zig - zag edges are of zes - type that do not change their energy as function of the field and do not contribute to the diamagnetic susceptibility .",
    "the zes for gqd of different sizes are located in the middle of the gap @xmath37 as is shown in fig .",
    "we note that @xmath37 indicates the real gap in the spectrum for the triangular gqd , and the value of the this gap is inversely proportional to the number of zes @xmath53 : @xmath54where the numerical constant is @xmath55 .",

    "although zes give no contribution to the orbital susceptibility , they can be responsible for the huge paramagnetism provided by @xmath61 uncompensated electron spins located on the degenerate zes levels .",
    "this happens in the case of small positive chemical potentials if the energy of electron - electron repulsion in each zero - energy state @xmath62 , so that these levels remain half - filled .",
