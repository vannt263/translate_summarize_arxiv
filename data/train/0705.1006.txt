    "the current idea of a _ negative - pressure _ dominated universe seems to be inevitable in light of the impressive convergence of the recent observational results ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this in turn has led cosmologists to hypothesize on the possible existence of an exotic dark component that not only would explain these experimental data but also would reconcile them with the inflationary flatness prediction ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "this extra component , or rather , its gravitational effects is thought of as the first observational piece of evidence for new physics beyond the domain of the standard model of particle physics and constitutes a link between cosmological observations and a fundamental theory of nature ( for some dark energy models , see @xcite . for recent reviews ,",

    "@xcite proposed a relationship between the ultraviolet ( uv ) and the infrared ( ir ) cutoffs due to the limit set by the formation of a black hole ( bh ) .",
    "the uv - ir relationship in turn gives an upper bound on the zero point energy density @xmath1 , which means that the maximum entropy is of the order of @xmath2 .",
    "this zero point energy density has the same order of magnitude as the dark energy density @xcite , and is widely referred to as the holographic dark energy ( hde ) @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . however , the hde model based on the hubble scale as the ir cutoff seems not to be able of leading to an accelerating universe @xcite . a solution to this matter",
    "was subsequently given in ref .",
    "@xcite that discussed the possibilities of the particle and the event horizons as the ir cutoff , and found that only the event horizon identified as the ir cutoff gave a viable hde model @xcite . the hde model based on the event horizon as the ir cutoff was found to be consistent with the observational data @xcite .    a subsequent development concerning the idea of a holographic dark energy is the possibility of considering interaction between this latter component and the dark matter in the context of a holographic dark energy model with the event horizon as the ir cutoff . as an interesting result",
    ", it was shown that the interacting hde model realized the phantom crossing behavior @xcite , which is also obtained in the context of non - minimally coupled scalar fields ( see , e.g , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "other recent discussions on interacting hde models can be found in @xcite .    in this paper , we test the viability of the interacting hde model discussed in ref .  @xcite by using the new 182 _ gold _ supernovae ia ( sne ia ) data @xcite , the 192 essence sne ia data @xcite , the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) measurement from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite , and the shift parameter determined from the three - year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap3 ) data @xcite .",

    "we consider a spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker universe with dark matter , hde and radiation .",
    "due to the interaction between the two dark components , the balance equations between them can be written as @xmath3 @xmath4 where the hde density is @xmath5 in the above equations , @xmath6 is the ir cutoff , @xmath7 is the reduced planck mass , @xmath8 is the equation of state of the hde , @xmath9 is a particular interacting term with the coupling constant @xmath10 , and the subscript @xmath11 means the current value of the variable .",
    "the hde , dark matter and radiation density parameters are defined , respectively , as @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "note that , if we choose the hubble scale as the ir cutoff , i.e. , @xmath15 , then we find that @xmath16 , which means that the hde always follows the dark matter .",
    "even though the hde equation of state @xmath17 can be less than @xmath18 with the help of the interaction @xcite , this model can not explain the transition from deceleration to acceleration .    as suggested by li @xcite , one can choose the future event horizon or particle horizon as the ir cutoff .",

    ", it was argued that the effective equation of state of the hde in the interacting case should be @xmath27 based on this effective equation of state , it was concluded that there was no phantom crossover even for an interacting hde model .",
    "in fact , by combining the friedmann equation with eqs .",
    "( [ meq1 ] ) and ( [ deeq1 ] ) , we obtain the acceleration equation @xmath28 for a flat universe , the physical consequence of the phantom dark energy is a super - acceleration when the dark energy dominates .",

    "we have analyzed the observational viability of an interacting hde model characterized by the parameters @xmath42 and @xmath10 and shown that in order to make it compatible with current observational data only the future event horizon can be used as the ir cutoff . by assuming a particular interacting term and fitting the model to the observational data , we have found that an hde is capable of explaining the current observations of sne ia , bao and shift parameter from cmb data for the intervals of the parameters @xmath45 , @xmath42 and @xmath10 displayed in table i. from both analyses ( involving the 192 sne ia essence data and the new 182 _ gold _ sample ) we have also found that a very weak coupling or even a noninteracting hde model is favored ( @xmath85 ) . by using the fitting results for the parameters , we have shown",
    "that the expansion rate in the interacting hde model can be super - accelerated , i.e. @xmath86 , which is the key physical consequence of the so - called phantom behavior @xcite .",
