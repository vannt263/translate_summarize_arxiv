    "around 10% of white dwarfs ( wds ) in the solar neighborhood are low - mass ( @xmath1 0.45 ) helium - core objects @xcite .",
    "the oldest globular clusters in the galactic halo are currently producing @xmath20.53  wds @xcite .",
    "hence , the presence of low - mass helium - core wds in the galactic disk requires a formation mechanism other than the normal single star evolution .",
    "the most commonly accepted formation channel for low - mass wds is through enhanced mass loss from post - main - sequence stars in interacting binary systems .",
    "such stars can lose their outer envelopes without reaching the asymptotic giant branch and without ever igniting helium , thus ending up as helium - core wds .",
    "the large number of low - mass wds found in binary systems support this formation scenario @xcite .",
    "however , not all low - mass wds are found in binary systems @xcite .",
    "@xcite propose a scenario for the formation of single low - mass wds in which binary interactions of post - main - sequence stars with close - in massive planets can expel the stellar envelope .",
    "the planets may or may not survive the common envelope evolution . in the latter case , there is no way of knowing whether low - mass wds are produced through this formation channel .",
    "@xcite predict that the minimum companion mass required to expel the envelope of the progenitor 1  star is 21 @xmath3 .",
    "based on mid - infrared photometry , @xcite limit any undetected companions to @xmath4 around eight single low - mass wd systems . therefore , a well tuned common - envelope phase scenario involving 20 - 40 @xmath3 companions is required to explain the radial velocity and infrared observations of the apparently single low - mass wds .",
    "even though this scenario seems unlikely , it can not be ruled out due to the caveats in our understanding of the common - envelope phase evolution .    an alternative scenario for the formation of single low - mass wds",
    "was proposed by @xcite to explain the color - magnitude distribution of the wds in the metal - rich cluster ngc 6791 .",
    "metal - rich stars have increased opacities and thus increased mass loss winds ; extrapolating theoretical mass loss models to [ fe / h]=+0.4 suggests that mass loss can approach 0.40.5  on the red giant branch @xcite . thus a single low - mass wd may result from a single metal - rich star because of severe mass loss winds on the red giant branch .",
    "@xcite observe that most of the brightest wds in ngc 6791 are indeed low - mass wds , and they suggest that at least 40% of the stars in that cluster have lost enough mass on the red giant branch to end up as he - core wds .",
    "the relatively large fraction of low - mass wds in ngc 6791 compared to the 10% fraction in the field wd sample likely points to the dependency of stellar evolution on metallicity .",
    "thus a mechanism exists to produce single low - mass wds in metal - rich environments .    in the mass - loss wind scenario ,",
    "the formation rate of single @xmath50.4 helium wds is dominated by the old stellar population ; intermediate - mass metal - rich stars , even with enhanced mass loss winds , have enough mass to ignite helium in their cores and eventually form ordinary carbon - oxygen wds . according to the @xcite analysis of stars within 30 pc ,",
    "3% of solar neighborhood stars with @xmath68 gyr ages have [ fe / h]@xmath6 + 0.3 .",
    "this is comparable to the fraction of single low - mass wds in the pg survey wd population , which @xcite estimate is 4% .",
    "thus single metal - rich field stars provide another possible origin for single low - mass wds .",
    "all three scenarios mentioned above  mass - loss due to binary companions , planets , and winds  likely contribute to the population of low - mass wds , the question is by how much .",
    "the binary formation channel is generally considered to be the dominant mechanism , however the remaining two channels are also likely to contribute . understanding the frequency of binary / single low - mass wds is necessary to constrain the formation models .    in this paper , we measure the binary frequency of the 30 low - mass wds found in the palomar green ( pg ) survey @xcite .",
    "we provide 720 radial velocity observations for the 21 previously unstudied low - mass wds , and investigate the near - infrared color excess of the whole sample .",
    "we find that at least 70% of the pg wds with @xmath7 are binaries , and compare this observed binary fraction and orbital period distribution to other samples of wds and to low - mass wd formation models .",

    "similarly , @xcite find that 15 of 636 wds ( 2.4% ) observed in the spy survey are single low - mass wds .",
    "@xcite estimate that the fraction of metal - rich stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath6 + 0.3 has been more than 2 - 3% in the past 10 gyr .",
    "thus the observed frequency of single low - mass wds is consistent with the enhanced mass - loss scenario .",
    "while binary frequency provides a useful constraint on formation scenarios , the period distribution is fundamental to evolution of the low - mass wd binary systems .",
    "figure [ fig : pmhi ] compares the observed orbital period distribution of two complete , magnitude - limited samples : the 0.4  wds studied here , and the 0.2  wd systems studied by @xcite .",
    "interestingly , none of the 0.2  wd systems have orbital periods longer than a day , whereas at least 40% the 0.4  wd systems have orbital periods longer than a day .",
    "the tightest main - sequence binary systems will interact the earliest in their evolution ; they will go through common envelope phases , lose their envelopes before helium ignition in the core , and end up as he - core wds in even tighter binary systems .",
    "thus finding the lowest mass wd binaries in the most compact binary systems is consistent with our understanding of binary evolution .",
    ", width=336 ]      we close by noting that old , metal - rich stellar populations dominate in many astrophysical environments , namely , the bulges and spheroids of galaxies .",
    "the existence of single low - mass wds in the field , as well as the observed stellar population of ngc 6791 , demonstrate that old , metal - rich stars are evolving through at least one of the unique channels discussed here .",
    "these evolution channels will affect the red giant luminosity function , blue horizontal branch morphology , and the integrated light of the overall stellar population @xcite .",
    "@xcite , for example , argue that hot subdwarf stars formed from he - he wd mergers naturally explain the uv - upturn seen in the integrated light of elliptical galaxies .",
    "thus the existence of single low - mass wds in the field , and the evolutionary channels they are linked to , has important implications for interpreting the age , metallicity , and mass - to - light ratio of metal - rich stellar populations throughout the universe .",
    "we discuss radial velocity and photometric observations of 30 low - mass wds identified in the magnitude limited pg survey .",
    "we identify a total of 21 binary systems and provide orbital parameters and limits on companion masses .",
    "our sample includes two wd+wd merger systems and two pre - cataclysmic binaries , one of which is a new discovery .",
    "nine objects in our survey do not show significant radial velocity variations .",
    "six of these objects have mid - infrared photometry and none show mid - infrared excess from stellar or massive brown dwarf companions .",
    "thus the fraction of single , low - mass wds is 20%30% . we discuss the potential formation channels for these single low - mass wds : binary mergers of lower - mass objects , mass loss due to interactions with substellar companions , and mass loss due to super - solar metallicity winds .",
    "binary mergers of two lower - mass wds would most likely create he - burning sdb stars more massive than 0.4 .",
    "the birth rates of single subdwarf b and low - mass wd stars are comparable .",
    "therefore , the merger scenario is unlikely to explain all of the single low - mass wds . instead , a significant fraction of the single low - mass wds may form as a result of interactions on the red giant branch with substellar companions or because of enhanced mass loss from the most metal - rich stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "our understanding of the different formation channels for single low - mass wds will benefit from infrared observations that can put strong limits on potential substellar companions and from theoretical studies on common envelope evolution and the fate of short period ms + brown dwarf ( or massive planet ) systems .",
    "the observed mass and period distributions of our targets are useful for constraining binary evolution theory via population synthesis studies , which can probe different evolutionary channels for low - mass wd formation .",
