    "in recent years instabilities in rotating conducting fluids under the influence of magnetic fields became of high interest . especially in view of astrophysical applications",
    "the consideration of differential rotation is relevant .",
    "it has been known for a long time that differential rotation with negative shear ( ` sub - rotation ' ) becomes unstable under the influence of an axial field @xcite . when considered separately ,",
    "both ingredients of the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) , i.e. the axial field and also the kepler rotation , are stable .",
    "the full system proves to be unstable if and only if the fluid is sub - rotating .    for ideal fluids the criterion of stability against axisymmetric perturbations of differential rotation under the presence of _ toroidal _ fields reads @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the permeability and @xmath7 the density @xcite . in this relation",
    "the existence of axisymmetric kinetic and magnetic perturbations depends solely on the radial profile of the rotation law .",
    "the stability problem of toroidal fields plus differential rotation in cylindric geometry has been studied by several authors often considering the perturbations as axisymmetric , @xcite .",
    "after ( [ mich ] ) solid - body rotation and all kinds of super - rotation (  positive radial shear   ) are _ stabilized _ by the magnetic field unless the field strongly increases outwards .",
    "the profiles @xmath2 ( current - free between the cylinders ) and @xmath3 ( @xmath4-pinch , homogeneous axial electric - current , see @xcite ) can not destabilize any form of super - rotation if only axisymmetric perturbations are considered . it has been demonstrated that for fields with @xmath2 _ all _ taylor - couette flows are stable against axisymmetric perturbations . the azimuthal magnetorotational instability ( amri )",
    "is thus basically nonaxisymmetric @xcite .",
    "taylor - couette flows with positive shear are the prototype of hydrodynamic stability , @xcite .",
    "the more surprising is the finding that even weak magnetic toroidal fields can easily destabilize such flows if also nonaxisymmetric perturbations are taken into account , @xcite .",
    "we shall even demonstrate that the radial profile of the fields  if not too steep  does not play an important role to allow instability .",
    "on the other hand , the new instability is a double - diffusive phenomenon which does not appear if the molecular viscosity and the molecular magnetic resistivity are of the same order .",
    "the equations of the problem are @xmath8 with @xmath9 for an incompressible fluid .",
    "@xmath10 is the velocity , @xmath11 the magnetic field , @xmath12 the pressure , @xmath13 the kinematic viscosity and @xmath14 is the magnetic diffusivity .",
    "the basic state in the cylindric system with the coordinates @xmath15 is @xmath16 for the poloidal components and @xmath17 for the rotation law with the constants @xmath18 here @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 as the radii and @xmath22 as the angular velocity of the inner cylinder . with @xmath23 super - rotation",
    "is represented by @xmath24 .    for the magnetic field",
    "the stationary solution is @xmath25 the radial magnetic profile @xmath3 is due to an applied homogeneous axial electric current ( ` @xmath4-pinch ' ) while @xmath2 is current - free in the fluid .",
    "we define @xmath26 . almost always @xmath27 is chosen . the current - free field",
    "is then given by @xmath28 and the field in the @xmath4-pinch is @xmath29 .",
    "the dimensionless physical parameters of the system are the magnetic prandtl number @xmath0 , the hartmann number @xmath30 and the reynolds number @xmath31 , i.e. @xmath32 these three parameters combine to the magnetic mach number @xmath33 indicating whether the rotation energy dominates the magnetic energy or not .",
    "a linear code is used to solve the set of ordinary differential equations for the radial functions of flow , field and pressure which results after a fourier mode transformation @xmath34 of the fluctuations .",
    "the solutions are optimized with respect to the reynolds number for given hartmann number by varying the wave number .",
    "only solutions for @xmath35 are discussed in this letter .",
    "the hydrodynamic boundary conditions at the cylinder walls are assumed as @xmath36 .",
    "the cylinders are made from perfect - conducting or  in one case  from insulating material . for the conducting walls the fluctuations @xmath37 must fulfill @xmath38 at both @xmath20 and @xmath21 so that ten boundary conditions exist for the set of ten differential equations ( see @xcite ) . for @xmath39",
    "one can easily show that the system is degenerated under the transformation @xmath40 so that all eigenvalues ( for specific @xmath31 and @xmath30 ) are valid for each pair @xmath41 .",
    "we start with rotation laws where the outer cylinder rotates with higher frequency than the inner cylinder . for the small magnetic prandtl number of @xmath42 fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] presents the lines of marginal instability ( i.e. for vanishing growth rate ) for the two rotation profiles with @xmath43 and @xmath44 . the magnetic field between the cylinders",
    "is fixed to the vacuum - type , @xmath2 .",
    "the form of the resulting lines corresponds to the general form of the lines for the amri ( with sub - rotation ) where the line of marginal instability forms a tilted conus where both branches have a positive slope , @xcite .",
    "absolute minima of the hartmann number and the reynolds number exist , below which the rotation law is stable . above the minima",
    "the instability domain is always limited by two critical values of the hartmann number or the reynolds number . for a given ( supercritical ) reynolds number",
    "there is a minimum magnetic field for the instability and there is a maximum magnetic field suppressing the instability . above the weak - field branch",
    "the rotational shear is too strong to support nonaxisymmetric perturbations .",

    "requires much higher hartmann numbers and reynolds numbers than the steeper rotation law with @xmath44 .",
    "the rotation law with @xmath45 nowhere within the gap reaches the minimum rossby number @xmath46 which is found by local approximations of the solution of ( [ mhd2 ] ) as a lower limit which should be exceeded for instability @xcite .",
    "the reason might be that , as the plots also show , this rossby number is by far not uniform over the radius for taylor - couette flows . they also demonstrate that a lower limit does not exist for perfect - conducting boundaries at the mentioned value .",
    "it is clear , however , that for more and more flat rotation law the supercritical reynolds numbers and hartmann numbers are growing .",
    "the question is whether a minimum value @xmath47 indeed exists for which the critical reynolds number and hartmann number reach infinity .",
    "whether such a limit exists below @xmath43 is not yet finally clear for numerical reasons .",

    "[ fig1b ] gives the optimized wave numbers of the instability normalized with the gap width @xmath48 along the two branches of instability for small and large @xmath0 .",
    "the axial size of cell is @xmath49 .",
    "cells with @xmath50 are thus prolate while cells with @xmath51 are oblate with respect to the rotaion axis .",
    "the limit @xmath52 for nearly spherical cells is marked by a horizontal dotted line .",
    "the plot demonstrates that the cell geometry strongly depends on the magnetic prandtl number . for small @xmath0",
    "also the wave numbers are small hence the cells are prolate or spherical . along the strong - field",
    "( lower ) branch of the instability cone the wave numbers exceed those at the low - field ( upper ) branch where the cells are rather long in axial direction . for @xmath53 , however , the wave numbers at both branches of the conus are larger than @xmath54 so that the cells are always very flat .",
    "also the drift rates possess a strong @xmath0-dependence .",
    "the drift values as given in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1b ] are the real parts @xmath55 of the frequency @xmath56 of the fourier mode of the instability , normalized with the rotation rate of the _ outer _ cylinder .",
    "because of @xmath57 the azimuthal migration has the opposite sign of @xmath55 .",
    "for amri with negative shear we always found that the pattern migrates for all @xmath0 in positive @xmath58-direction ( @xcite ) .",
    "for tayler instability under the influence of super - rotation the situation is more complicated as the pattern counterrotates for small @xmath0 while it corotates for @xmath59 , @xcite .",
    "the plot in fig .",
    "[ fig1b ] shows similar results . for small @xmath0",
    "positive @xmath55 occur and the perturbation pattern indeed rotates _ backwards_. large @xmath0 provide negative drift values hence the pattern migrates with the rotation . for @xmath60",
    "the pattern rotates just as the outer cylinder ( only possible for large @xmath0 ) .",
    "figure [ fig1d ] gives the coordinates of the locations with minimum hartmann number shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] for @xmath44 but for various @xmath0 .",
    "one finds that for @xmath61 both the hartmann number and the reynolds number converge ( to @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) .",
    "the curves scale , therefore , with @xmath30 and @xmath31 for small @xmath0 , so that the numerical values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 given in fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] for @xmath42 ( sodium ) can also be used for the smaller value of gallium .    on the other hand , for increasing @xmath0",
    "the minimum hartmann number and the reynolds number are ( slightly ) reduced .",
    "more important is that the curves stop at @xmath64 indicating that for higher values of @xmath0 no solutions unstable against perturbations with @xmath65 exist . for @xmath66",
    ", however , the instability resurrects with strikingly low reynolds numbers ( fig .",
    "[ fig1e ] , right ) .",
    "the low reynolds numbers ensure that also for large magnetic prandtl numbers the magnetic mach number remains smaller than unity .",
    "instabilities which only exist for @xmath67 belong to the class of _ double - diffusive _ instabilities @xcite .",
    "they do not appear for @xmath68 .     and their corresponding reynolds numbers from the curves of marginal instability shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] for @xmath44 vs. @xmath0 . for @xmath69",
    "no solution exists . for @xmath1 the hartmann numbers ( crosses ) and reynolds numbers ( squares ) for @xmath70 ( up ) and @xmath71 ( down )",
    "are given but only for @xmath72 .",

    "[ fig1e ] ( left ) gives the instability map for @xmath73 for the two cases of perfect - conducting walls and insulating boundary conditions .",
    "the application of the rather steep rotation law with @xmath73 has only numerical reasons , the magnetic prandtl number of @xmath42 characterizes liquid sodium ( for laboratory experiments ) .",
    "note that for vacuum boundaries the super - rotation laws are much more stable than for perfect - conducting conditions .",
    "for amri with negative shear the critical hartmann numbers for both kinds of boundary conditions do only slightly differ ( but also with higher values for vacuum conditions ) .",
    "the influence of the boundary conditions is also large if the instability of the @xmath4-pinch under the presence of differential rotation is considered . often , however , vacuum boundary conditions lead to a much easier excitation of the instability than the conducting conditions do , see @xcite",
    ".    one finds from the figs .",
    "[ fig1a ]  [ fig1e ] the expected trend with @xmath74 for the minimum reynolds number . for",
    "perfect - conducting boundaries and @xmath42 it decreases from 3500 for the flat rotation law ( @xmath43 ) to 250 for the steeper rotation law ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "a taylor - couette flow with resting inner cylinder is clearly the most simple model for super - rotating fluids . as it also forms the steepest radial profile ( @xmath75 ) we expect the minimal hartmann numbers which are suitable for a laboratory experiment ( with cylinders from conducting material ) . the thin red line in fig .",
    "[ fig2a ] valid for the current - free field @xmath2 and for @xmath42 provides a minimum hartmann number of about 145 . in order to transform this value to the necessary electric - current along the axis ( i.e. within the inner cylinder )",
    "the well - known relation @xmath76 can be rewritten as @xmath77 with @xmath78 as the hartmann number after ( [ pm ] ) formed with @xmath20 instead with the gap width @xmath48 .",
    "we find @xmath79 or @xmath80 kamp for liquid sodium as the conducting fluid ( with @xmath81 in c.g.s . ) .",
    "this is the minimum current for instability with the gap width @xmath82 .",
    "another calculation for @xmath83 and @xmath71 presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1d ] leads to @xmath84 with only 33 kamp as the critical electric - current . though the size of the container does not influence the critical value of the electric - current but the gap width does .",
    "the wider the gap the weaker the necessary current which is necessary to excite the amri for super - rotation .",
    "sofar we did not vary the radial profile @xmath85 of the magnetic background field .",
    "one of the new questions is , however , how sensitive the described instability of super - rotating fluids reacts on the presence of axial electric - currents within the fluid .",
    "in addition to the current - free field , in fig . [ fig2a ] the lines of marginal instability for the field @xmath3 of the @xmath4-pinch with uniform axial current are given for two different magnetic prandtl numbers .",
    "as the new examples ( thick lines ) contain axial electric - current , the tayler instability for @xmath86 appears at certain values @xmath87 of the hartmann number @xcite , which themselves do not change for changing @xmath0 @xcite .      for larger reynolds numbers",
    " if the rotation becomes important ",
    "one finds only little differences of the lines of marginal instability for the two field profiles with or without axial electric background current in the fluid .",
    "the minimum hartmann number for instability are slightly reduced by the currents but the differences are small .",
    "the main result is that the magnetic - induced instability of super - rotation in mhd taylor - couette flows does not strongly depend on the radial profile of the field .",
    "it already works for current - free fields but axial electric - currents do not basically change the system , which is even true for the @xmath4-pinch with its uniform current density .",
