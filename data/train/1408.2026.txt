    "low mass and possibly high mass stars gain additional mass through a circumstellar disk at their late stage of formation .",
    "as the disk itself evolves planets are born in the dense dusty midplane , hence these systems are called protoplanetary disks .",
    "the physical and chemical environments of the disk is thus vital for determining the properties of these planets . among all the chemical species in a disk ,",
    "water is one of the most important , because : ( 1 ) it may carry most of the oxygen that is available , the only competitors being co and possibly @xcite ; ( 2 ) it may contribute significantly to the heating and cooling of the disk material , hence affecting the dynamics ; ( 3 ) it may shield the disk material from uv radiation @xcite ; ( 4 ) it may aid in the coalescence of dust particles to form planetesimals @xcite ; ( 5 ) its relation to the origin and sustaining of life .    water vapor has been detected in protoplanetary disks through infrared rovibrational and rotational lines @xcite . for the most part these observations are spatially and spectrally unresolved , leaving some uncertainty regarding the overall spatial distribution of water vapor within the disk .",
    "however , the combination of _ spitzer _ and _ herschel _ data provide access to transitions arising from a wide range of energy states ( ground , 0  k , to thousands of k ) ; in this case the abundance distribution of water vapor might be inferred using other information to constrain the physical structure ( e.g. density and temperature ) . in one intriguing study , @xcite infer a warm , narrow , and high column density ring of water at a distance of 4  au to the central star in tw  hya by fitting to the _ spitzer _ and _ herschel _ spectra .",
    "the water vapor temperatures assumed by these observers for fitting their data apparently show a dichotomy .",
    "the cold water vapor has temperatures @xmath4100  k , and the hot / warm water vapor has temperatures of 2001500  k. though never directly spatially resolved , model fittings in these works suggest that the hot water are concentrated in a small region close to the central star , and the cold water are distributed over an extended region in the outer disk",
    ".    a few questions naturally arise .",
    "( 1 ) how are the water molecules formed in these disks ?",
    "( 2 ) what is the interstellar heritage of water in the disk ? did all water form in the prestellar core prior to stellar birth ?",
    "( 3 ) what environmental factors determine the presence of water , and which region and which evolution stage of the disk does the observed water trace ? ( 4 ) where do these water molecules ultimately go ? ( 5 ) are they related to the water found on planets and comets , and if related , how ?",
    "the present work will not be able to answer all these questions , but will only contribute to the understanding of questions 1 and 3 .",
    "some recent studies related to question 2 and 5 can be found in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ; see also the review by @xcite .    among the many modeling efforts devoted to the chemistry of protoplanetary disks ( for recent reviews ,",
    "see @xcite and @xcite ) , a few have focused on gaseous water . in @xcite high water abundances",
    "is obtained in the molecular transition layer of the inner disk heated by x - rays .",
    "they emphasize the role of formation , since is a precursor of water .",
    "@xcite point out that when dust is settled , water becomes the dominant absorber of uv photons , shielding itself from uv dissociation .",
    "this self - shielding effect also limits the column density of warm water vapor to @xmath5  @xmath2 and that of oh to @xmath6  @xmath2 .",
    "the model of @xcite shows that in herbig ae protoplanetary disks water is distributed in three regions with distinct properties : a deep warm region , an irradiated hot region , and a photodesorbed cold region .",
    "@xcite caution that the interpretation of the observed water emission is affected by uncertainties in the chemical input data and radiative transfer .",
    "the recent work of @xcite focus on the role played by the photodissociation of water and oh . in their model warm water is limited to the inner 4  au of the disk .    in this work",
    "we follow a parameterization approach to study the chemistry of warm water vapor . our goal is to identify the main stellar and disk parameters that determine the water repository ,",
    "specifically we clarify the role of water self - shielding in maintaining its abundance , and in this paper we are _ not _ aiming to reproduce any specific observational results , which will be the content of a follow - up work .",
    "section  [ secmodel ] contains description of a new code we have created from scratch for this study . in section  [ secresults ] we present the results , and we conclude our paper in section  [ secconclusion ] .",
    "the layout of our code is similar to the prodimo code @xcite . given a distribution of gas and dust , we first solve the dust temperature distribution with a monte carlo method based on the strategy of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , in which the dust temperature of a spatial cell is updated each time a photon packet cross this cell ; this strategy is also adopted in the radmc code @xcite . although the geometry in our code is symmetric with respect to rotation around the central axis and reflection about the midplane , the photon propagation is done in full three dimensions .",
    "we have not yet implemented the diffusion approximation @xcite for the highly shadowed region where the photon statistics is low , and we mitigate this by allowing a large number ( @xmath7 ) of photon packets in the monte carlo . the whole spectrum ( from uv to sub - millimeter ) of the central star",
    "is used as input .",
    "observation and modeling of fluorescence have shown that ly  @xmath0 emission can dominate the uv spectrum @xcite . in this case",
    ", the resonant scattering by atomic hydrogen in the photodissociated regions is also important , and we treated this similar to @xcite . to increase the signal - to - noise ratio of line features like ly  @xmath0 , a smaller energy is used for photon packets when its frequency falls into the line profile .",
    "we also include the absorption of uv photons by water .",
    "since the abundance of atomic hydrogen and water is affected by chemistry , the whole process has to be iterated , which is slow but affordable .",
    "a byproduct of the radiative transfer is the distribution of radiation field over the whole disk , which will be used as input for chemistry and gas thermal balance .    after establishing the dust temperature distribution ,",
    "we evolve the disk chemistry for 1  myr .",
    "since the heating and cooling processes are coupled with chemistry , the gas temperature is evolved in tandem with chemistry based on the heating and cooling rates .",
    "namely , we solve the following set of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the abundance of species @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the production and destruction rates of this species , which are functions of the chemical abundances and temperature ( and other physical parameters ) , and @xmath13 is the total number of species .",
    "@xmath14 is the volume - specific heat capacity of an ideal gas , where @xmath15 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the exact value of @xmath16 is not important , because we are only concerned with the equilibrium temperature , rather than the rate of temperature change .",
    "the heating and cooling rates are contained in @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we do not need a separate set of equations to account for the elemental conservation , since elements are automatically conserved within numerical tolerance . for solving the above set of odes , we use the dlsodes solver of the odepack package @xcite , which makes use of the sparse structure of the chemical network .",
    "the initial chemical composition is listed in table  [ tabchemini ] .",
    "the gas temperature is set to the dust temperature at @xmath19 , and usually reaches steady state within a short period .",
    "we note that the chemistry can not always reach a steady state within 1  myr , and may still evolve at time scale @xmath20  yr .",
    "we could also solve the chemical equilibrium ( or rather quasi - equilibrium ) and thermal equilibrium independently .",
    "but in such an approach iteration for each single grid point will be needed to achieve a joint convergence , which may pose some numerical issues and takes more cpu time , while in our approach thermal equilibrium is guaranteed as far as the heating / cooling time scale is shorter that the time scale of interest ( @xmath31  myr ) .",
    "one note about the global iteration in our code . for the radiative transfer in the first iteration , only dust is assumed to be present .",
    "this gives a distribution of dust temperature and radiation intensity over the whole disk .",
    "based on this the chemistry and gas temperature is solved on the grid points in a downward ( i.e. from surface to midplane ) then outward ( from close to the central star to the disk outer edge ) order .",
    "this order has the advantage that the self - shielding of and co can be updated each time a grid point has been calculated during one iteration .",
    "the radiative transfer is redone before each chemical and thermal calculation of the whole disk , to take into account the effects ( h scattering , water absorption ) due to updated chemical composition .",
    "the changes in the radial water abundance profile at different vertical height as the iteration proceeds will be described later in section [ sechowimpwater ] . since the code has a monte carlo component ( for the radiative transfer ) built in , perfect convergence is not expected .",

    "in our test runs we did not see such an effect , and we interpret this as ( see also @xcite ) due to the fact that our parameterized model does not adjust the vertical structure accordingly when the heating rate is increased , which would otherwise decrease the opacity to the dissociating uv photons .",

    "the reason is that in our model a higher stellar luminosity increases the overall temperature of the entire disk .",
    "the higher dissociating photon flux associated with a higher @xmath193 does not necessarily reduce the water content , because uv photons are readily shielded by the dust , and get converted into photons with lower frequency and no dissociating capability and diffuse into the disk to warm up the dust and gas .",

    "our model does not yet contain a self - consistent prescription for dust growth and settling ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the first is to reduce the overall dust mass of the disk , while keeping the dust - to - gas mass ratio equal the fiducial value over the whole disk ; the second is to reduce the scale height of the larger grains , keeping a population of small grains well - mixed with gas , while the overall dust - to - gas mass ratio stays the same as in the fiducial model .",
    "the resulting warm water distribution as a function of dust - to - gas mass ratio and of the dust scale height can be seen in figure  [ figwatervsdust2gas ] and figure  [ figwatermassvshcdust ] .",
    "the general trend is that less dust present in the bulk of the disk means less warm water vapor .",
    "the zoom - in plots in figure  [ figwatervsdust2gas ] show that the size of the region containing high - abundance water vapor shrinks as the amount of dust is reduced .",
    "the main reason is that when dust is reduced , water is more susceptible to uv dissociation .",

    "the self - shielding of water only starts to work at a certain depth , depending on the density and uv intensity , but at such a depth the dust temperature may already drops to a level lower than the water condensation temperature .",
    "see the next section for further discussion on this .",

    "hence the absorption due to water can be dominant over dust if water is present in gas phase at its highest possible abundance , as shown by @xcite , which is also noted in @xcite .",
    "however , we have seen in the previous section that when the dust is settled or reduced , the amount of water that is present is also reduced .",

    "the dust - to - gas mass ratio is set to @xmath161 , and all the rest parameters are the same as the fiducial model . a close look at this figure shows that the curves for second and third iterations extend inward towards the central star relative to the curve of the first iteration , due to the self - shielding of water . for the midplane where the gas density is very high",

    "since the parameters @xmath245 , @xmath246 , and @xmath247 in the right hand side may change with depth , so will the variables in the left hand side , which is what we will solve in the following .    at the present",

    "we take into account the dust attenuation and the self - shielding . since the self - shielding of involves the column density of @xcite , we first treat equation  ( [ eqnh2 ] ) as a differential equation of @xmath271 since @xmath272 , and after @xmath271 at depth @xmath249 is solved",

    "we calculate this value based on equation  ( [ eqh2odens ] ) , but corrected for the competitive reactions involving o and c , though these reactions are not included in the integration . in the calculation the dust property is taken to be the same as in the fiducial model ( section [ secfiducial ] ) .",
    "we adopt the following rate parameters : @xmath274 where @xmath275 is the number flux of ly  @xmath0 photons .",
    "we assume @xmath276  k.    the importance of the shielding due to and oh can be tested by considering the changes in the depth ( we call it `` shielding depth '' ) at which water reaches a `` high '' abundance , which we arbitrarily take to be 10% of the total available oxygen abundance .",
    "the shielding depth as a function of the dust - to - gas mass ratio is plotted in figure  [ figshieldingdepth ] for different densities .",
    "the solid lines are for cases which include the shielding due to dust , , and oh , while the dashed lines are for cases in which the shielding due to and oh are turned off .",
    "different panels have a different uv continuum and ly  @xmath0 intensity .    as can be seen in figure  [ figshieldingdepth ] , for lower densities ( @xmath277  @xmath72 ) and strong uv fields , the shielding depth is rather large ( @xmath1541  au ) for normal or small dust - to - gas mass ratios , which indicates that in reality water can not form through the hot neutral chemistry at such densities ( if the uv radiation is as strong as we have assumed here ) , because at the calculated shielding depth the dust temperature might have decreased to the condensation temperature of water .",
    "also can be seen is that the effect of turning - off the shielding due to water and oh is not significant for low densities , high dust - to - gas mass ratio , or strong uv fields , but becomes significant otherwise .",
    "for example , for @xmath278  @xmath72 , in the strong uv field case , when the dust - to - gas mass ratio is reduced to @xmath279",
    " @xmath103 times the normal ism value , turning off and oh shielding increases the shielding depth by a factor of a few to ten , while in the weak uv field case the shielding depth can increase by more than two orders of magnitude . on the other hand ,",
    "the shielding depths at such high densities are small anyway , hence the changes may not have obvious practical effects .",
    "for example , figure  [ figdiffh2o ] shows the radial water abundance profile at the midplane ( @xmath280  @xmath72 ) for dust - to - gas mass ratio equal @xmath161 , with or without water shielding . without water shielding the profile recedes slightly further away from the inner edge . with even smaller",
    "dust - to - gas mass ratio the distinction will be larger",
    ". however , as described above for the low density case , since the shielding depth increases as dust - to - gas mass ratio decreases , at some point the shielding depth will be large enough that the dust temperature drops below the water condensation temperature , and it becomes impossible to keep abundant water in the gas phase . in the extreme case , when there is no dust , then the problem becomes that can not be maintained ( for @xmath281 the photodissociation time scale of is of the order of days ) for water to form in the first place .",
    "another issue is that , when the dust becomes optically thin , the dust temperature may also drop because less radiation can be trapped , which makes water more likely to condense out unless the total surface area of dust grains has been extremely reduced .    in the above discussions we did not include chemical reactions involving excited molecules .",
    "uv radiation can excite molecules to vibration levels with @xmath282 , which is capable of increasing the rate coefficients profoundly @xcite .",
    "however , the net effect depends on the abundance of excited , which depends on the uv intensity and collisional deexcitation rates . for density",
    "higher than @xmath283  @xmath2 and @xmath159 , we estimate that the abundance of excited will be too low to affect the discussion here .    as a side note regarding figure  [ figdiffh2o ] ,",
    "the fact that the depth at which the water abundance reaches higher than 10% of the total oxygen abundance is larger than what would be expected from the top panel of figure  [ figshieldingdepth ] ( 0.05  au versus 0.01  au ) is due to the activation of hot neutral chemistry that destroys water . since the dust - to - gas mass ratio is much reduced , the accommodation cooling is not effective and the gas temperature can be much higher than the dust temperature ( @xmath31500  k versus @xmath3200  k ) . at this temperature not only gets destroyed by reacting with h atoms , is also reduced to a low abundance ( @xmath30.01 ) due to reaction with oh . a simple analytical model can not easily capture all these features .     reaches @xmath284 ) as a function of dust - to - gas mass ratio for different gas densities .",
