    "studies of self - gravitating systems with spherical symmetry are one of the most important applications of gravity theories , above all because they are directly related to one of the most notable objects in nature : the stars .",
    "general relativity ( gr ) modifies the usual predictions of the newtonian theory for static , spherically symmetric systems in many different ways , and at the same time makes possible the emergence of a new class of structures , black holes ( bhs ) , collapsed objects that can represent the final fate of supermassive stars .",
    "the crucial concept characterizing bhs is the existence of an event horizon , a hypersurface isolating the internal region of a collapsed object from the external region with distant observers living in almost flat space - time .",
    "the vacuum static , spherically symmetric solution of gr , known as the schwarzschild solution , describes the simplest bh .",
    "its generalizations are the charged static black hole represented by the reissner - nordtstrm ( rn ) solution , rotating ( kerr ) and charged rotating ( kerr - newman ) black holes @xcite . in the non - vacuum case ,",
    "one important type of configurations are those of static charged dust , represented by the majumdar - papapetrou ( mp ) solution @xcite : it represents an equilibrium between gravitational attraction and electric repulsion .",
    "an important feature of the mp system is that it actually does not need spherical or any other spatial symmetry for its existence : the static equilibrium between gravity and electric forces allows for any spatial shape of a charged dust cloud provided the mass to charge density ratio takes everywhere the proper value : @xmath7 in natural units ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 being the speed of light and @xmath10 the newtonian gravitational constant ) .",
    "the mp systems have been revived in quite a new context connected with the so - called quasi - black holes ( qbhs ) [ 512 ] .",
    "these are systems on the threshold of forming a black hole horizon but the horizon does not form .",
    "this becomes possible since equilibrium between gravitational attraction and electrostatic repulsion exists for any size of the object close to the horizon radius . from the viewpoint of a distant observer",
    ", the system looks indistinguishable from a true bh , although in the vicinity of this would - be horizon their properties are very different .",
    "all these examples are implemented in the pure gr context , using at most the electromagnetic field as an external source .",
    "less known systems are those which include scalar fields .",
    "one initial reason for ignoring scalar fields were doubts on the existence of fundamental scalar particles in nature .",
    "the recently announced discovery of the higgs boson may invalidate these doubts .",
    "anyway , bhs with scalar fields have been considered many times in the literature since scalar fields are the simplest possible sources of the gravitational field .",
    "scalar fields minimally coupled to gravity were considered for the first time , to our knowledge , by fisher @xcite who found a solution to the einstein - massless scalar field equations .",
    "a counterpart of fisher s solution for massless scalar fields with a wrong sign of the kinetic energy ( the so - called phantom scalar ) was found by bergmann and leipnik @xcite , and both solutions were repeatedly re - discovered afterwards .",
    "later , a general study of spherically symmetric scalar + gravity systems , including a possible non - minimal coupling ( hence in the context of a general scalar - tensor theory of gravity rather than pure gr ) , was undertaken in @xcite , where some nontrivial new configurations corresponding to bh and wormhole structures were identified . among special cases thereof",
    "are neutral and charged bhs @xcite and  with a conformally coupled scalar field as well as the so - called ellis  ( described by the simplest case of the bergmann - leipnik solution @xcite ) and  in the brans - dicke scalar - tensor theory @xcite in the case where the coupling constant @xmath11 is smaller than @xmath12 .",
    "these results were somehow extended later by identifying the so - called cold bhs , i.e. , bhs containing scalar charges , exhibiting zero surface gravity and infinite horizon surface areas @xcite . in general , to obtain such cold bhs , the scalar field must have negative kinetic energy , that is , it must be phantom and violate the standard energy conditions .    the emergence of string theories as a possible candidate for a unified theory of all interactions has led to new ingredients with important consequences for the studies of structures like bhs .",
    "string theory in its effective low - energy formulation predicts the existence of scalar and gauge fields with a nontrivial coupling between them .",
    "more precisely , the string effective action contains a scalar field , the dilaton , nonmiminally coupled to gravity . if the electromagnetic field is kept in the neveu - schwarz sector of the tree - level string action , re - expressed in the einstein frame , the coupling between the dilatonic and electromagnetic fields appears in an exponential form , as @xmath13 , where @xmath2 is the dilaton .",
    "however , taking into account the loop expansion of string theory , one can obtain other ( and hard - to - identify ) coupling functions @xmath1 instead of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "this motivates studies of the einstein - maxwell - dilaton ( emd ) system with an arbitrary function @xmath1 .",
    "concerning exact static , spherically symmetric solutions for the emd system , to the best of our knowledge , the solutions for @xmath15 were obtained for the first time in @xcite , where also a family of what we now know as `` dilatonic '' @xcite was singled out .",
    "later on , the emd system with an arbitrary function @xmath1 was considered @xcite in attempts to obtain a nonsingular , classical , purely field particle model .",
    "the conditions were revealed under which a regular center in the emd system is possible , and an explicit example of such a regular model was built .",
    "more general studies , inspired by achievements in various field limits of supergravity and superstring theories , were undertaken in the 90s and involved extensions of the emd system to space - times of arbitrary dimensions with products of multiple factor spaces and , as material sources of gravity , a number of scalar dilatonic fields ( @xmath16 ) and a number of antisymmetric forms of different ranks ( @xmath17 ) , of which the electromagnetic field @xmath18 is the simplest representative , see @xcite for reviews .",
    "various classes of exact solutions were found , among them many  ones ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , of which the most well - known are the so - called `` black branes '' with different configurations of extra factor spaces . it should be noted that in all these studies the interaction between scalar and antisymmetric form fields was assumed in the exponential form , like @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a matrix with constant real elements .",
    "returning to four dimensions with a single scalar interacting exponentially with a single electromagnetic field , we can say that the most complete study of this  emd system was carried out in @xcite where the initial action was not restricted to only a string - inspired coupling and included the possibility of a phantom behavior of both scalar and maxwell fields .",
    "many new bh structures were revealed , asymptotically flat or not , but all of them required the existence of phantom fields , either in the scalar or in the electromagnetic sector ( or in both ) .",
    "all these new structures have properties similar to cold black holes in the sense that their surface gravity is zero .",
    "( for a study of a perfect - fluid source of vacuum emd fields see @xcite ) .",
    "such an extremal nature of these phantom emd bhs leads to a speculation that structures like qbhs , previously based on the majumdar - papapetrou solution of gr , could be implemented for such more general phantom bhs : since in all these cases the scalar field is phantom , it is possible to conjecture on a qbh configuration supported by an attractive or repulsive effect of a scalar field in addition to electric repulsion .",
    "this idea has been initially considered in a phd thesis of one of the co - authors of the present work , robson silveira , who died in 2009 before completing the proposed study . before his death , he was able to obtain some initial results indicating that such scalar qbhs are really possible and designing some of their main properties .",
    "in particular , he found qbhs supported by only a phantom scalar field .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to report on a more general analysis completing his findings .",
    "we include into consideration all ingredients which were earlier discussed separately : matter ( electrically and scalarly charged dust ) , an electromagnetic field and a scalar field interacting with it in a dilatonic manner .",
    "we make some general observations on possible equilibrium configurations ( to be called dilatonic mp , or dmp systems ) and pay special attention to bhs and qbhs supported by certain electric and scalar charge distributions . in particular",
    ", we try to find phantom - free configurations , i.e. , those able to exist with positive - definite energy densities of matter and both fields . some of the results have been already briefly presented in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii presents the general emd field equations , section iii specializes them for static systems to be considered , section iv describes their two simple special cases , one of them being that of mp systems , the other its purely scalar counterpart . in section v we make some observations about general emd systems without symmetry and determine , in particular , the necessity of a nonzero scalar charge density for their existence .",
    "section vi is devoted to general properties of  systems , including the conditions at a regular center , at a horizon , and at flat spatial infinity .",
    "we also obtain a balance condition between the mass and integral electric and scalar charges , applicable to any  systems , not necessarily spherical ones .",
    "the general properties of  bhs and qbhs are also described , including limiting transitions between them . in section",
    "vii we give some examples of bhs and qbhs , showing , in particular , that both are possible without invoking phantom matter or fields .",
    "section viii deals with the properties of cylindrically symmetric configurations .",
    "lastly , section ix summarizes and discusses the results .",
    "consider the lagrangian ( putting @xmath21 ) [ l ] l = + l_m + a_j^+ j , where @xmath22 ( @xmath23 for a normal scalar field @xmath2 ) , @xmath24 is the lagrangian of matter , @xmath25 is the scalar charge density , @xmath26 ( @xmath27 , the electromagnetic field ) , @xmath28 is the 4-current , @xmath29 is the 4-velocity . for generality , and also to provide correspondence with @xcite , we do not fix the sign of @xmath1 .",

    "let us now assume that the spatial metric @xmath35 is flat ( but not necessary written in cartesian coordinates in which @xmath47 ) .",
    "then @xmath48 , and the einstein equations @xmath49 and @xmath50 read ^2 [ er00 ] p",

    "i ^k ) = p _ i ^k which does not contain the densities , hence it holds both in vacuum and in matter .",
    "since in our static system @xmath52 reduces to @xmath53 ( with the index @xmath54 ) , the equation of motion ( [ motion ] ) now leads to the equilibrium condition [ equi ] _ m _ i - _ e _ i ^- = j_i ; the continuity equation takes the usual form @xmath55 and holds automatically .",
    "let us briefly recall the classical case @xmath56 , @xmath57 , that is , electrically charged dust , the majumdar - papapetrou ( mp ) system .",
    "the scalar equation ( [ eq - s1 ] ) is absent , while ( [ int ] ) gives [ int0 ] ^2 _ i ^k = _ i ^k .",

    "thus we have [ phi - mp ] = ^-1 . using ( [ eq - f1 ] ) and ( [ er00 ] ) as expressions for @xmath64 and @xmath51 , we then obtain @xmath65 and 4_m = 4_e [ rho - mp ] = -^3(^- ) .",
    "( [ int ] ) and ( [ equi ] ) hold automatically .",
    "the charge and mass densities , equal in absolute value , are thus ( up to the factor @xmath66 ) sources of the effective gravitational potential @xmath67 . on the contrary , for each smooth @xmath68 one finds the proper charge and mass distribution able to be its source .",
    "noteworthy , it is not necessary here to assume a relationship between the functions @xmath69 and @xmath70 , it has emerged automatically from the equilibrium conditions .",
    "a somewhat similar situation is observed if we put , on the contrary , @xmath71 . in this case ,",

    "one can consider a set of point sources instead of their continuous distribution .",
    "however , the nature of these point sources is quite different .",
    "thus , in the mp system the field of a point source satisfies @xmath74 , whence [ gam - rn ] ^",
    "= x/(m + x ) , x : = ( x_i x^i)^1/2 , under the boundary condition @xmath75 as @xmath76 , and @xmath77 has the meaning of the schwarzschild mass .",
    "as is well known , it is an extreme  with a horizon at @xmath78 , at which the spherical radius @xmath79 is equal to @xmath77 .    unlike that , in the einstein - scalar field system ( [ rho - smp ] ) implies @xmath80 outside a source , hence , under the same boundary condition , @xmath81 , and the source at @xmath82 is a naked singularity .",
    "in the general static case we have the following independent equations : ( [ eq - s1 ] ) , ( [ eq - f1 ] ) , ( [ er00 ] ) and ( [ int ] ) . the tensor equation ( [ int ] )",
    "implies that @xmath34 , @xmath2 and @xmath36 are functionally related , so that , if @xmath83 , we can put @xmath84 and @xmath85 .    indeed , if we assume the contrary , e.g. , that @xmath34 and @xmath2 are functionally independent , then they can be chosen as curvilinear coordinates in 3-space , say , @xmath86 and @xmath87 . then from the corresponding components of ( [ int ] ) we immediately obtain @xmath88 and @xmath89 , so that either @xmath90 or @xmath91",
    ". if we take @xmath84 , the @xmath92 component of ( [ int ] ) makes a contradiction ( the l.h.s .",
    "is nonzero while the r.h.s . is zero ) , while if @xmath91 , the same happens to the @xmath93 component .",
    "thus our assumption , that @xmath34 and @xmath2 are independent , is wrong .",
    "the same is concluded if we assume independence of @xmath94 or @xmath95 .",
    "now , assuming @xmath84 and @xmath85 , ( [ int ] ) takes the form [ int00 ] ^2 ( 1 + _",
    "^2 ) = p _ ^2 , where the index @xmath34 denotes @xmath96 .",
    "hence we have the following arbitrariness : for any @xmath1 and any 3d profile @xmath70 , even more than that , for an arbitrary scalar field distribution @xmath85 ( up to certain restrictions ) , we find @xmath97 from ( [ int00 ] ) , and the remaining field equations ( [ eq - s1 ] ) , ( [ eq - f1 ] ) and ( [ er00 ] ) give us the mass , electric and scalar charge distributions that support this field configuration .",
    "the condition ( [ equi ] ) holds due to the einstein equations .",
    "it is of interest whether or not it is possible to provide @xmath98 , that is , to find configurations without an independent scalar charge , where the @xmath2 field exists only due to its interaction with the electromagnetic field .",
    "assuming @xmath99 , the equilibrium condition ( [ equi ] ) gives ^_m = _ e d / d .",
    "substituting it into ( [ eq - s1 ] ) , we obtain the following relation : [ j=0 ] 2_+ ( 2 _ + p _ ) _ i ^i = 0 .",
    "if we wish to admit configurations with any @xmath70 , then the quantities @xmath100 and @xmath101 are actually independent , and we should require that the factors near them vanish . then we obtain @xmath6 ( the scalar field is trivial ) and @xmath102 ( no scalar - electromagnetic interaction ) , thus actually returning to the mp situation .",
    "we conclude that sufficiently general configurations with @xmath103 can not be obtained without a scalar charge density @xmath25 ; however , special solutions to ( [ j=0 ] ) with particular profiles of @xmath34 for specific @xmath1 must exist .",
    "meanwhile , static dust with non - interacting @xmath2 and @xmath18 , corresponding to the special case @xmath57 , can evidently form nontrivial configurations if we admit @xmath104 , and some examples will be given below .",
    "in what follows we will try to obtain examples of bh and quasi - bh ( qbh ) configurations in the simplest cases of spherical and  symmetries , and of special interest can be those of them where all kinds of matter are `` normal '' , in particular , @xmath105 and @xmath106",
    ". such an opportunity is not forbidden , but its realization causes some difficulty .",
    "the latter is illustrated by the expression for @xmath51 in terms of @xmath107 and @xmath108 , obtained by combining ( [ er00 ] ) and ( [ int ] ) : [ rho_m ] 4_m = ^2 ( - ^i_i -^i_i ) .",
    "we see that a normal scalar field ( @xmath109 ) makes a negative contribution to @xmath51 .",
    "if , for example , we choose @xmath70 satisfying the mp vacuum equation @xmath110 , we obtain simply @xmath111 .",
    "nevertheless , since a normal scalar field , like gravity , creates attractive forces between dust particles , it is natural to expect the existence of phantom - free dmp systems where this new attractive component is balanced by an electric charge density larger than in mp systems .",
    "in the case of spherical symmetry , the metric ( [ ds ] ) with the flat 3-metric @xmath35 takes the form [ ds1 ] ds^2 = ^2 dt^2 - ^-2(dx^2 + x^2 d^2 ) , where @xmath112 is the usual spherical coordinate in flat 3-space and @xmath113 is the line element on a unit sphere .",
    "our set of equations takes the form [ chi1 ] 2x^-2 ^ 2(x^2) + p_^2 - 8j(x ) , [ phi1 ] x^-2 ( p ^-2 x^2 )",

    "^- j , where the prime denotes @xmath114 .",
    "the above arbitrariness transforms here into the freedom of choosing the functions @xmath107 and @xmath108 even if the coupling function @xmath1 has been prescribed from the outset .",
    "all other quantities are then found from ( [ chi1])([equi1 ] ) , including the mass , electric and scalar charge distributions that support this field configuration .",
    "it is of interest how to choose the arbitrary functions in order to obtain a starlike configuration with a regular center or a bh . in all cases",
    "it is also of interest to see how to provide a phantom - free configuration with @xmath105 and @xmath106 . in doing so",
    ", we can use ( [ rho_m ] ) which now takes the form [ rho_m1 ] 4_m = ^2 (  + 2/x - ^2 -^2 ) .",

    "c = , and we can use the taylor expansion [ a - c ] ^2 a(x ) = a_0 + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 + ,  a_i = ,  a_0 = ^2_c . according to the field equations , we must also have , as @xmath115 , [ phi - c ] ( x ) = _ c + o(x^2 ) , ( x ) = _ c + o(x^2 ) , with some constants @xmath116 and @xmath117 , and this provides finite values of the densities @xmath51 , @xmath64 and @xmath25 at the center . the expression ( [ rho_m1 ] ) then leads to [ rho_mc ] 8_m = 3a_2 + 2 a_3 x + , while the @xmath2 field only contributes beginning with @xmath118 .",
    "thus a positive density near the center requires , as usual , that @xmath119 should have there a minimum .",
    "the question on possible killing horizons inside a charged dust distribution is somewhat more involved . to begin with , in ( [ ds1 ] ) the coordinate @xmath112 is quasiglobal , which means that it behaves near a horizon in the same way as null kruskal - like coordinates @xcite",
    ", whence follows the requirement that all functions characterizing the system should be analytical at the corresponding point @xmath120 , hence near the horizon @xmath121 , where @xmath122 and @xmath123 is the order of the horizon .    from ( [ ds1 ] )",
    "it is clear that a horizon of finite radius @xmath124 is only possible with @xmath125 and @xmath126 ( a _ double , or extremal horizon _ ) . assuming a simple horizon ( @xmath127 ) at @xmath128",
    ", we obtain @xmath129 , hence a singularity ; on the other hand , a higher - order horizon ( @xmath130 ) with any @xmath131 corresponds to an infinite radius @xmath132 .",
    "a continuation beyond such a horizon is possible under some special conditions , and then we are dealing with the so - called `` cold bhs '' , see @xcite .",

    "furthermore , the metric analyticity leads , via the einstein equations , to analytic behaviors of the set components , in particular , of the quantities @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "the latter means that we can in principle assume ^~x^s ,  s  as  x0 , so that @xmath135 , and only @xmath136 corresponds to @xmath137 as @xmath115 .",
    "it follows from ( [ int1 ] ) that p ^2",

    "evidently , the relation ( [ charges ] ) , having been derived from the asymptotic properties of  systems , is valid as well for any ( island - like ) emd system since all of them are approximately  in the asymptotic region .      in the present paper ,",
    "we mainly consider  systems with the metric ( 35 ) written using the coordinate @xmath112 which is , by the existing terminology , simultaneously isotropic ( since the spatial part is conformally flat ) and quasiglobal ( since @xmath189 @xcite ) .",
    "however , bearing in mind the popularity of the schwarzschild ( curvature ) coordinates , including their usage in previous papers on mp systems and qbhs , we here present some general relations in these coordinates , which can be helpful for comparison .",
    "the schwarzschild coordinate @xmath190 is the curvature radius of coordinate spheres , i.e. , [ r ] r = x ^-  ^ = x / r , so that in @xmath191 the factor @xmath112 responsible for the possible existence of a horizon ( at @xmath78 ) is singled out .",
    "the metric now reads ds^2=^2dt^2 - ^-2 ^ 2 dr^2 - r^2 d^2 , where = = . for extremal bhs considered here , @xmath192 near the horizon @xmath193 ,",

    "assuming that the functions @xmath243 and @xmath244 are finite and smooth at @xmath78 , a substitution of the ansatz ( [ gam - q ] ) and ( [ sub1 ] ) into the field equations shows that the matter density tends to a finite limit as @xmath210 , namely , 4_m ; the quantities @xmath161 , @xmath64 and @xmath25 also remain finite .",

    ", we obtain that the first three terms in ( [ rho_m2 ] ) contribute negatively to @xmath51 near @xmath322 , so that @xmath170 can be obtained only with @xmath141 .",
    "we conclude that neither  bhs nor stringlike dmp configurations with a regular axis ( in particular , stringlike qbhs ) can be phantom - free .",
    "therefore we abstain from giving particular examples here .",
    "the well - known static mp systems in gr include gravitational and electromagnetic fields and electrically charged dust with equal densities @xmath323 .",
    "we have considered a generalization of mp systems , including a dilatonic scalar field ( the dilatonic mp , or dmp systems ) with an arbitrary coupling function @xmath1 in the lagrangian ( [ l ] ) , where the scalar field @xmath2 may be normal or phantom . as in mp systems ,",
    "the metric has a conformally flat spatial part .",
    "a dmp system is characterized by the metric function @xmath70 , the electric potential @xmath324 , the dilaton field @xmath325 , and three densities , those of mass , @xmath326 , electric charge , @xmath327 , and scalar charge , @xmath328 .",
    "let us enumerate the main results obtained .    1 .",
    "it has been shown that static configurations are possible with arbitrary functions @xmath329 ( @xmath4 ) and @xmath85 , for any regular coupling function @xmath1 , without any assumption of spatial symmetry .",
    "2 .   for general static systems ,",
    "the field equations imply that the functions @xmath330 , @xmath325 and @xmath69 are related , so that if , say , @xmath331 , then @xmath5 and @xmath84 .",
    "it is thus unnecessary to postulate the existence of such functional relations , as is often done .",
    "3 .   there are purely scalar analogs of mp systems , but only with phantom scalar fields . however , the corresponding point sources are different : an extreme bh for mp , a singularity for scalar mp .",
    "it has been shown that sufficiently general configurations with nontrivial scalar fields can not be obtained without a nonzero scalar charge density @xmath25 ; this , however , does not forbid the existence of special solutions with @xmath99 for particular @xmath1 . 5 .",
    "there is a universal balance condition , ( [ charges ] ) , between the schwarzschild mass and the electric and scalar charges , valid for any  dmp systems , including those with horizons and/or singularities .",
    "it generalizes the results previously obtained for special cases ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "6 .   in the case of spherical symmetry ,",
    "the existence conditions have been formulated for bh and quasi - bh ( qbh ) configurations with smooth matter , electric charge and scalar charge density distributions .",
    "it turns out that horizons in dmp systems are second - order ( extremal ) , in agreement with the general properties of qbhs @xcite .",
    "7 .   for qbhs containing a small parameter @xmath9",
    "whose nonzero value distinguishes them from bhs , different limiting transitions @xmath208 are analyzed .",
    "they lead to universal solutions independent of the particular choice of a qbh configuration .",
    "the limiting metrics coincide with those obtained previously for mp systems .",
    "examples of  bh and qbh solutions have been obtained . among them",
    "are phantom - free ones , that is , the mass density and the energy densities of both scalar and electromagnetic fields are nonnegative .",
    "9 .   for cylindrically symmetric configurations ,",
    "the conditions at a regular center , a possible horizon and at flat infinity have been formulated .",
    "it has been shown that neither  bhs nor stringlike dmp configurations with a regular axis ( in particular , stringlike qbhs ) can be phantom - free .",
    "some of these results have been briefly presented in @xcite , viz . ,",
    "items 1 , 3 , 5 , and 8 ( partly ) . in addition , in @xcite , polycentric configurations , possible in the dmp framework , were discussed , with any number of mass concentrations .",
    "for instance , one can consider the metric ( [ ds ] ) in cartesian coordinates @xmath332 ( so that @xmath333 ) and choose [ f_n ] ^-(x^i)f(x^i ) = _",
    "a=1^n f_a ( x_a ) , where @xmath334 are functions of @xmath335 , @xmath336 being the ( fixed ) coordinates of the @xmath314-th center . as @xmath334",
    ", one can take any functions providing  solutions , e.g. , bhs or qbhs .",
    "a complete solution is obtained after choosing the function @xmath337 , or equivalently @xmath338 , which should be regular at all relevant values of @xmath213 and decay sufficiently rapidly at spatial infinity , as @xmath339 . in @xcite ,",
    "an example is given of such a system with two mass concentrations , where each `` center '' can be a bh or a qbh .",
    "we would like to stress that it is in general rather difficult to find sources that admit qbh configurations since matter begins to collapse long before approaching a would - be horizon .",
    "it is the freedom in choosing the metric function @xmath107 that enables us to keep dmp configurations static even extremely closely to emergence of a horizon .",
