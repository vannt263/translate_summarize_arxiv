    "the next @xmath1  linear collider ( nlc ) will be an excellent place where to study precision top quark physics . the  collision energy range at this machine is foreseen to be between 300 gev ( most probably in the first phase of operation ) and 500 gev , with a luminosity of the order of 10  cms @xcite .",
    "top production at nlc will be very interesting both at the threshold region , where one expects some enhancement in the cross section due to the toponium resonance remnants , and in the continuum region @xcite . at threshold",
    ", one can measure @xmath8 with an accuracy better than 500 mev .",
    "the shape of the excitation curve can be precisely predicted in perturbative qcd .",
    "also , it will be quite sensitive to the perturbative strong coupling constant , the top width and higgs boson mass and yukawa coupling to the top quark .",
    "on the other hand , in the continuum top production well above the @xmath12  threshold , one will be able to test the @xmath13 coupling through the study of angular correlations in the @xmath12  decay products , as well as the existence of anomalies in the top couplings and possible non - standard top decay modes .",
    "although as yet unobserved , the existence of the top quark is strongly required by the theoretical consistency of the standard model . direct search of top quark at tevatron has yielded a lower limit @xmath14 gev at 95% c.l .",
    ", for a top with standard - model decays @xcite .",
    "the upgraded phase of the machine should either discover the top or exclude the mass range up to 160 - 180 gev .    on the other hand , precision electroweak measurements from lep1 , @xmath15 determination at hadron colliders and neutrino scattering constrain the top mass through radiative corrections in the range m_t= ( 162^+16 + 18_-17 - 21 ) gev [ eq : topmass ] where the first error comes from experimental uncertainties and the second corresponds to varying the higgs mass between 60 gev and 1 tev , with a central value of 300 gev @xcite .",
    "according to present limits on @xmath8 , the top mass could well be in the range ( 150 - 200 ) gev .",
    "if this were the case , in the first phase of nlc corresponding to a  energy of about 300 gev , the collision energy could be not sufficient for top - pair production .",
    "in this situation , since the top is considerably heavier than the @xmath0 vector boson , top quarks are mainly produced in association with a @xmath0 and a @xmath16 quark through the processes [ eq : procwtb ] e^+ e^- & & t |b w^- + e^+ e^- & & |t b w^+ .    in fig.1",
    ", we show the feynman diagrams corresponding to @xmath3@xmath4@xmath5 ( charge conjugated graphs correspond to the reaction @xmath3@xmath4@xmath17 ) .",
    "aside the @xmath18 channel that is responsible for top pair production above threshold , in single top production also @xmath19 and @xmath20 channels , where a virtual @xmath16 quark and @xmath0 respectively are exchanged , contribute to the cross section .",
    "in particular , the @xmath20 turns out to be the dominant contribution in almost the whole interesting @xmath9 range , that is @xmath21 .",
    "of course , cross sections are @xmath22 and therefore quite smaller than those relative to top pair production ( reported in table 1 ) which are of the order of 1 pb at nlc (  ref.@xcite ) .    @xmath23 [ tab : tt ]    in the present work we make a detailed study of single top production in @xmath1  collisions below the @xmath12  threshold , namely when @xmath24 .",
    "we mainly refer to the practical case of nlc with @xmath2 gev and an integrated luminosity of 10 fb , but also other possibilities for the @xmath1  collision energy are considered . as far as the top mass is concerned",
    ", we focus on the range @xmath25 gev , with @xmath26 .",
    "we will neglect throughout our study toponium resonance effects near the @xmath12threshold .",
    "as anticipated , cross sections are found to be rather moderate ( of the order of a few fb s ) and marginal for the study of top properties at the foreseen nlc luminosity .",
    "nevertheless , single top production could be a relevant background for rare processes and possible new physics signal at future @xmath1  colliders .",
    "in fact , as a result of the fast top decay , one observes a @xmath27 final state , that is a possible background for any process involving multi - vector boson production .",
    "for instance , standard - model processes like @xcite and @xcite involve the same final state .",
    "also , analogous signals could correspond to new physics effects , chargino production in supersymmetric models @xcite .",
    "single top production in @xmath1  collisions through the process @xmath1",
    "@xmath28 was considered in ref.@xcite for @xmath29 - 60 ) gev at petra and tristan energies . with this kinematical configuration ,",
    "a real @xmath0 in the final state ( as in @xmath3@xmath4@xmath5 ) is not allowed and single top production occurs mainly through the higher - order reaction @xmath30@xmath3  @xmath31 , where an almost - real photon is radiated by the initial @xmath4  beam .",
    "therefore , the corresponding production rates are quite small ( and undetectable ) . for instance , at @xmath32 and 65 gev total cross sections of @xmath33 fb and @xmath34 fb , respectively , are found for @xmath35 gev .",
    "after completion of our work , we learnt of two recent studies concerning single top production at lep200 @xcite . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "analytical expressions for cross sections of the reaction @xmath1",
    "@xmath28 are given for the photon initiated process , as well as for the @xmath20 and @xmath18 contributions ( where @xmath36 ) .",
    "unfortunately , below the @xmath12  threshold , event rates are found to be too small for @xmath8 larger than the present tevatron limit , even for  energies of 220 - 250 gev ( that are , however , well above the foreseen @xmath9 at lep200 ) . in this work , as in ref.@xcite , the authors concentrate on @xmath37 final states , that replace the real @xmath0 in the reaction @xmath3@xmath4@xmath5 .",
    "this is because with the lep200  energy , for most of the interesting @xmath8 range , one can not afford to produce a top quark plus a _ real _ @xmath0 .",
    "hence , the higher - order @xmath30@xmath3  @xmath31 process becomes the dominant channel .",
    "instead , in the case of @xmath3@xmath4@xmath5  at higher  energies , that we consider here , the final @xmath37 state can be replaced by other leptonic and hadronic decays of the @xmath0 , that are equally interesting and increase the production rate . as far as @xmath18 and @xmath20 channels are concerned , we compared the output of our programs with the results of ref.@xcite and found complete agreement at lep200 energies .    in ref.@xcite ,",
    "a similar study for single top production at lep200 has been carried out with drastically different results with respect to ref.@xcite .",
    "we think that such disagreement is due to a mis - treatment of the photon collinear singularity in the process @xmath1",
    "@xmath28 that largely overestimates the contribution from diagrams with a photon exchange in the t - channel .",
    "we stress that the nlc regime , that we are considering here , will provide for the first time the environment to study single top production _ at the leading order _ and with observable rates .",
    "furthermore , contrary to the previous studies , we include the @xmath19 contribution and study in detail kinematical distributions .",
    "after a short description of our computation method , in section 2 , we will discuss the behaviour of total cross sections for the reaction @xmath3@xmath4@xmath5@xmath38 versus @xmath9 and @xmath8 , stressing the relative importance of various contributions to the matrix element squared . in section 3 , we will study the distribution in the @xmath39 invariant mass and the angular distribution of the top with respect to the beam .",
    "once more , contributions from different diagrams will be emphasized . in section 4",
    ", we will give our conclusions .",
    "in fig.1 , the seven feynman diagrams contributing to the process @xmath3@xmath4@xmath5at tree level are shown . as a result ,",
    "one has 28 terms , including interferences , in the expression for the matrix element squared .",

    "as @xmath9 approaches @xmath105 , @xmath106 is enhanced in the positive @xmath58 region , and top quarks that are collinear to the @xmath4  are dominant .",
    "fig.[fig : wtb8 ] shows that the virtual-@xmath0 contribution is responsible for the first effect while virtual-@xmath10 diagrams produce rather forward - peaked top quarks along the @xmath4  beam .",
    "( 12.0,18.0 ) ( 0.3,4.5 )    ( 0.3,-4.5 )    [ fig : wtb8 ]    in fact , what one observes in @xmath106 reflects the differences in the angular distributions for the `` parent '' processes @xmath3@xmath4@xmath107  and @xmath3@xmath4@xmath68  . in @xmath3@xmath4@xmath107 , the @xmath108",
    "is produced preferentially along the @xmath3  direction ( see , , ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the top quark produced through the virtual-@xmath0 diagrams in @xmath3@xmath4@xmath5  and coming from the @xmath109 decay , due to its heaviness , well reflects the would - be final @xmath108  direction in @xmath3@xmath4@xmath107 . hence",
    ", the top from @xmath20 will be preferentially along the @xmath3  direction too .",
    "on the contrary , the @xmath10 quark produced in the @xmath18 channel reflects the @xmath10 angular distribution in @xmath3@xmath4@xmath68 , that is always peaked toward the @xmath4  direction @xcite .    in fig.[fig",
    ": wtb8 ] , the case @xmath101 gev is considered in the region just below the threshold ( @xmath110 gev , fig.[fig : wtb8]a ) , where the @xmath20 and @xmath18 contributions are comparable , and at very high  energy ( @xmath111 tev , fig.[fig : wtb8]b ) . in the latter case , it is possible to distinguish a small peak at @xmath112 due to the relative enhancement at high @xmath9 of the virtual-@xmath0 contribution (  fig.[fig : wtb4 ] ) .",
    "in this paper , we have studied single top production in @xmath1  collisions through the processes @xmath3@xmath4@xmath5 , @xmath6 , considering aside the @xmath18 channel , that is relevant for top pair production , @xmath20 and @xmath19 channels , with @xmath113 and @xmath114 respectively . since present limits on @xmath8 imply that the top is considerably heavier than the @xmath0 vector boson , this process will be of relevance for top production at next linear @xmath1  colliders operating at a energy below the @xmath3@xmath4@xmath68  threshold .",
    "this , for instance , will be the case if the top is heavier than 150 gev for a nlc with @xmath2 gev or less .",
    "we found that , assuming an integrated luminosity of about 10 fb , production rates are sufficient to detect a top signal below the @xmath12  threshold for a large fraction of the kinematically allowed energy window @xmath115 .",
    "in particular , considering @xmath1  collisions at 240 @xmath116 gev , by varying @xmath8 from 150 gev up to 200 gev , we get cross sections from 4 to 9 fb for @xmath79 gev and from 0.9 to 4 fb for @xmath80 gev . for 180 @xmath81 200 gev ,",
    "one still obtains cross sections of the order of 1 fb or more for @xmath82 gev .",
    "the above rates include both the single @xmath10 and @xmath43 production .",
    "the relative importance of the @xmath18 , @xmath20 and @xmath19 contributions has been extensively studied both for cross sections and kinematical distributions .",
    "we found that the virtual-@xmath0 exchange is predominant in the total cross section for @xmath117 gev .",
    "for instance , if @xmath84 gev , @xmath20 contribution is more than one order of magnitude larger than the @xmath18 one for @xmath118 gev .",
    "consequently , also the kinematical features of the final states are governed by the @xmath20 channel well below the @xmath12  threshold .",
    "we have a rather broad @xmath53 distribution that reflects the non - resonant structure of the @xmath39 final state , as opposed to the @xmath18 case .",
    "furthermore , the top angular distribution recalls the @xmath108  one in the process @xmath3@xmath4@xmath107 that is quite opposite to the @xmath10 distribution coming from the @xmath18 contribution .",
    "we also found that , due basically to the different behaviour of the @xmath3@xmath4@xmath68  and @xmath3@xmath4@xmath107  cross sections versus @xmath9 , single top production mediated by a virtual @xmath0 can be non - negligible far above the @xmath12  threshold (  fig.[fig : wtb4 ] ) , although @xmath18 and @xmath20 interference effects tend to cancel the eventual increase in the total top production rate .",
    "however , for @xmath96 - 2 tev and sufficiently large luminosity , some @xmath20 effect could be detectable by studying distributions in particular ranges of kinematical variables (  fig.[fig : wtb8]b ) .",
    "as far as detection of a @xmath3@xmath4@xmath5  signal is concerned , as a result of the fast top decay , one observes a @xmath27 final state .",
    "hence , the study of single top production rates below the @xmath12  threshold are interesting not only by itself",
    ". a detailed knowledge of this process also leads to a better determination of the possible background for any process of moderate cross section involving multi - vector boson final states .",
