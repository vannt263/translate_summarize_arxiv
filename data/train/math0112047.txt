    "the sharpness means that if @xmath17 do not satisfy ( [ global stability condition with d ] ) , then the asymptotic stability of eq .",
    "( [ nonautonomouslinear ] ) can be destroyed by an appropriate choice of a periodic delay @xmath18 ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "let us explain briefly the nature of our further assumptions .",
    "in part , they are motivated by the sharp stability results for ( [ 1 ] ) obtained in @xcite ( @xmath6 ) and @xcite ( @xmath13 ) under the assumption that for some @xmath23 and for all @xmath24 , the following yorke condition holds : @xmath25 here @xmath26 is the monotone continuous functional ( sometimes called the yorke functional ) defined by @xmath27}\\phi(s)\\}$ ] . in general , @xmath1 satisfying ( [ ycond ] ) is nonlinear in @xmath28 . on the other hand ,",
    "in some sense it has a  quasi - linear \" form ( for example , @xmath29 } \\phi(s)$ ] can be written as @xmath30 ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath1 is sub - linear in @xmath28 , which makes impossible the application of the results from @xcite to the strongly nonlinear cases such as the celebrated wright equation @xmath31 which is also globally asymptotically stable if @xmath32 . roughly speaking",
    ", the yorke @xmath10-stability condition does not imply the wright @xmath10-stability result .",
    "our recent studies @xcite of ( [ we ] ) revealed the following interesting fact : the essential feature of the function @xmath33 in ( [ we ] ) allowing the extension of the wright @xmath10-stability result to some other nonlinearities is the position of the graph of @xmath1 with respect to the graph of the rational function @xmath34 which coincides with @xmath1 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 at @xmath37 .",
    "this suggests the idea to consider a  rational in @xmath38 \" version of the  linear in @xmath38 \" condition ( [ ycond ] ) to manage the strongly nonlinear cases of ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we will assume the following conditions * ( h ) * :    * ( h1 ) * : :    @xmath21 satisfies the    carathodory condition ( see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , for every    @xmath39 there exists    @xmath40 such that    @xmath41 almost everywhere on    @xmath42 for every @xmath43 satisfying the    inequality @xmath44 $ ] . *",

    "furthermore , * ( h ) * implies that @xmath47 is the unique steady state solution for eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) with @xmath48 . on the other hand , * ( h ) * does not imply that the initial value problems for ( [ 1 ] ) have a unique solution . in any case",

    "if , additionally , condition ( [ global stability condition with d ] ) holds , then @xmath55 .",
    "furthermore , condition ( [ global stability condition with d ] ) is sharp within the class of equations satisfying * ( h ) * : for every triple @xmath56 which do not meet ( [ global stability condition with d ] ) , there is a nonlinearity @xmath1 satisfying * ( h ) * and such that the equilibrium @xmath57 of the corresponding eq .",

    "[ rescaling ] the set of four parameters ( @xmath62 ) can be reduced",
    ". indeed , the change of time @xmath63 transforms ( [ 1 ] ) into the same form but with @xmath64 .",
    "finally , since @xmath38 is a positively homogeneous functional ( @xmath65 for every @xmath66 , @xmath24 ) , and since the global attractivity property of the trivial solution of ( [ 1 ] ) is preserved under the simple scaling @xmath67 , the exact value of @xmath68 is not important and we can assume that @xmath69 .",
    "also , the change of variables @xmath70 transforms ( [ 1 ] ) into @xmath71 $ ] so that it suffices that at least one of the two functionals @xmath72 satisfy ( [ y ] ) and ( [ y2 ] ) .    to prove theorem [ main ] , in sections [ schw ] and [ pofmr ] we will construct and study several one - dimensional maps which inherit the stability properties of eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "the form of these maps depends strongly on the parameters : in fact , we will split the domain of all admissible parameters given by ( [ global stability condition with d ] ) into several disjoint parts and each one - dimensional map will be associated to a part .",
    "some of the maps are rather simple and an elementary analysis is sufficient to study their stability properties .",
    "some  other maps are more complicated : for example , the proof of lemma [ gss ] involves the concept of schwarz derivative , whose definition and several of its properties are recalled below .",
