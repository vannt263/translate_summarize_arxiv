    "phase transitions are of great importance in almost all scientific fields . traditionally , a phase transition is said to be @xmath2th order if the @xmath2th derivative of the chemical potentials of the two phases involved is discontinuous at the transition point and all lower - order derivatives are continuous @xcite",
    ". transitions of orders higher than one often show , however , singularity in their transition points , and nowadays one usually distinguishes only first - order or discontinuous phase transitions ( fopts ) from continuous ones that include all the others @xcite .",
    "the first recorded continuous phase transition was the critical point of co@xmath3 discovered in 1869 by andrews @xcite .",
    "the renormalization - group ( rg ) theory for it and other continuous phase transitions in general @xcite was developed , however , more than one century later based on scaling and universality in the critical phenomena exhibit near such transitions @xcite .",
    "some of its results have now been predicted in high precisions and are consistent with high - quality microgravity experiments @xcite .",
    "fopts , on the other hand , have apparently a far longer history and appear far more frequently @xcite .",
    "take h@xmath3o as an example , its usual phase diagram contains three phases : ice , water , and vapor , which are common to daily life .",
    "all transitions between these phases are fopts except the isolated critical point at the end of the line of vaporization .",
    "the first well - known theory of phase transitions can be traced back to van der waals equation of state @xcite , which , besides the description of the critical point , when combined with maxwell s equal - area construction @xcite , predicts that there is a gas  liquid coexistence region , within which metastable states are separated from unstable states by a well - defined spinodal curve at which the isothermal compressibility diverges .",
    "gibbs theory of equilibrium @xcite further identifies two distinct mechanisms of equilibration for the two kinds of nonequilibrium states , viz . ,",
    "nucleation and growth @xcite versus unstable growth ( or spinodal decomposition @xcite that is often referred to binary systems ) , respectively .",
    "this picture of the fopts dominates their study for more than one century thereafter .",
    "nevertheless , a theory of nucleation is still considered to be quite good at present even if its predicted nucleation rate agrees with that measures only to within several orders of magnitude @xcite ; and the nonlinear theory of spinodal decomposition @xcite has yet to be substantially improved @xcite .",
    "the only modification to the picture is that the crossover of the two modes of transition is believed to be smooth rather than sharp and thus neither is the spinodal curve sharp if exists @xcite .",
    "in addition , metastable and unstable states are often accompanied with hysteresis , a non - equilibrium and nonlinear phenomenon that is difficult to control .",
    "accordingly , a general theory that is comparable to the well - developed framework of the rg theory for the continuous transitions has yet to be developed for the fopts .    a challenge question along",
    "this line is , instead of case study , whether there exist also scaling and universality in fopts that may be used as general characteristics to study them . in the case of equilibrium , within the framework of the rg theory ,",
    "the discontinuity of extensive variables across an fopt has been argued to correspond to the existence of a discontinuity fixed point with at least an eigenvalue equal to the dimensionality of the system @xcite .",
    "trivial scaling behavior then follows @xcite . in the dynamic perspective",
    ", there are two main occasions that scaling and universality emerge .",
    "one is usually referred to as phase - ordering kinetics in which a system evolves to an equilibrium thermodynamic state which consists of two coexisting phases from a non - equilibrium metastable or unstable one - phase state which originates usually from rapidly quenching of a one - phase , thermal equilibrium state @xcite . in such systems",
    ", one finds that in the late stages of growth , the structure function scales by a time - dependent characteristic length scale which characterizes the size of the growing domains @xcite .",
    "several universality classes have also been established in relation to model a , b , etc . that are originally defined in critical dynamics @xcite .",
    "naturally , the rg theory has been applied to such phase ordering kinetics to understand the origin of such dynamic scaling @xcite .",
    "however , lack of a small parameter analogous to the case in the critical phenomena renders such approaches essentially a scaling analysis @xcite .",
    "as many practical transitions are driven by an external field or the temperature in such a way that the systems change from one phase completely to the other , it has been found that energy dissipations and/or hysteresis exhibit scaling with respect to the sweep rate of field which serves as a characteristic of the irreversible processes involved @xcite .",
    "an rg theory has also been adapted successfully to the dynamic scaling of hysteresis in a toy vector model with infinite number of vector components and subjecting to a varying external field , arriving at scaling forms with respect to the field sweep rate that are determined by a zero - temperature fixed point and agree excellently with numerical results @xcite .",
    "a subsequent attempt to a more practical ising model using monte carlo rg method has not yet been able to determine the fixed point unambiguously @xcite .",
    "recently , focusing on the dynamics of a generic fopt driven by an external field in the @xmath4 model below its usual critical point , we have shown by a field - theoretic rg method that it is governed by an unexpected instability fixed point of a corresponding @xmath0 model . accordingly",
    ", it does exhibit a distinct scaling and universality behavior with corresponding instability exponents different from the critical ones @xcite . here",
    "we shall follow a more standard approach and study in detail a mean - field theory , a gaussian theory , a perturbation expansion about the mean - field theory , and a field - theoretic rg theory of the @xmath5 theory .",
    "we also employ the yang  lee edge singularity to improve the estimates of the instability exponents .",
    "the good agreement of these estimates with existent numerical results , together with the mean - field numerical and analytical outcomes , shows that , although in the mean - field theory , the fopt and the third - order transition described by the @xmath5 theory fall into opposite ground states and appear different , they are governed most likely by the same instability point and hence instability fixed points .",
    "we also discuss how the imaginary fixed points are reached , which is related to the relevancy of the fixed points .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "starting with a usual scalar @xmath1 model below its critical temperature in the presence of an external field , we derive an associated @xmath5 model that is relevant to the fopts involved in sec .",

    "analytical continuation of this free energy to the metastable region gives rise to a complex free energy , whose real part describes the equilibrium properties of the metastable states and imaginary part their lifetime @xcite .",
    "the free - energy functional or hamiltonian  ( [ h ] ) , on the other hand , is itself supposed to be a result of a constrained integration in ( [ f ] ) of those fields over a spatial region of size @xmath15 , or in terms of spatial fourier transform , @xmath16 those fields whose wave numbers are larger than a momentum cutoff @xmath17 , which is proportional to @xmath18 .",

    "nevertheless , we shall neglect this constraint in the following as we shall consider sufficiently long time universal behavior .",
    "the solution @xmath7 of the dynamic equations ( [ de ] ) and ( [ noise ] ) depends on @xmath29 and is thus stochastic and ought to be averaged over the distribution ( [ dxi ] ) .",

    "on the other hand , at least in simulations @xcite , scaling is easily found in all spatial dimensions without any detectable indication of difficulty for lower dimensions in which the fixed points are farther off .",
    "moreover , as has been pointed out , the hysteresis exponents found agree well with those of the @xmath5 theory . therefore , such a crossover is unlikely to be true if not exclusive at all .",
    "we also note that the crossover of the pseudo - critical phenomena @xcite can not either be a candidate as even in the mean - field level the theory is irrelevant as shown in sec .",
    "[ mfhys ] , although the hysteresis exponents that would be predicted by the theory , @xmath119 for @xmath120 from table  [ mfexp ] and @xmath121 in @xmath122 @xcite , are not far away from those listed in table  [ exp ] .    in order to see",
    "explicitly how the fixed points are reached , we now study the flow equations in detail by regarding them as rigorous equations .",
    "consider the flow of the coupling , eq .",
    "( [ kur ] ) , with @xmath123 given by eq .",
    "( [ betau1 ] ) . this equation is solved analytically by @xmath124 for the initial @xmath125 .",
    "one sees that @xmath126 converges to @xmath127 and 0 correctly for @xmath118 when @xmath117 is positive and negative corresponding to @xmath128 and @xmath129 , respectively .",
    "the denominator of the solution equals zero at a specific @xmath130 satisfying @xmath131 to @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is the sign function . because the running variable @xmath134 and the dimension @xmath117 are real , only real @xmath135 gives rise to a real @xmath130 . for @xmath136 , @xmath137 . as a result",
    ", it does not affect the flow from @xmath138 to @xmath139 and hence any initial @xmath135 will converge continuously to the gaussian fixed point as expected , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ flow](a ) .",
    "however , for @xmath140 , @xmath141 and the flow will blow out at @xmath130 for real @xmath135 .",
    "so , @xmath130 is the branch point of @xmath142 . yet , after approaching infinity , @xmath142 acquires an infinite imaginary part which then converges to the fixed point values as seen in fig .  [ flow](b ) and ( c ) .",
    "it seems that the divergence spontaneously triggers an imaginary part in @xmath142 so that the purely imaginary fixed point can still be reached as the solution  ( [ urk2 ] ) shows .",
    "conversely , one may imagine that in order to acquire an imaginary part to reach the imaginary fixed point , the initial real flow has to enter a divergent  no - man s \" region",
    ". nevertheless , the flow trajectory jumps abruptly from the real plane to the imaginary one as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ flow](a ) .",
    "however , it becomes continuous once @xmath135 possesses an imaginary part , no matter how small it is .",
    "the only difference for different values of the imaginary part is the magnitude of the convolutions shown in fig .",
    "[ flow](a ) .",
    "the smaller the former is , the larger the latter . also , no qualitative difference shows between different spatial dimensions below @xmath143 ; the difference is only the value of @xmath130 and again the magnitude of the convolution .",
    "we have checked that the divergence remains when considering the contribution from two - loop order , though in that case one has to resort to numerical solutions .",
    "as other variables depend on @xmath142 , they also exhibit a similar feature .",
    "one sees therefore that if the initial coupling possesses an imaginary value , the fixed points can be continuously reached irrespective of its magnitude , while for purely real initial values to converge to the imaginary fixed points the rg flows have to diverge at a finite scale in order to acquire an imaginary part . at present , we can speculate the reason for the imaginary nature of the fixed points .",
    "as noticed in @xcite , it has been shown that the free energy of metastable states is complex @xcite .",
    "in fact , since the @xmath5 theory is not bounded from below , an analytical continuation has to be performed in computing the free energy  ( [ f ] ) .",
    "in particular , as the free energy diverges for negative @xmath144 , the integration in this region has to be deformed to the imaginary axis .",
    "so , one should set @xmath145 in the integrand .",
    "this naturally leads to @xmath146 .",
    "consequently , an imaginary fixed point appears to be a natural and plausible choice for controlling the local unstable transition near the instability point of an fopt , just counter possibly to the intuition that only real values are physics .",
    "it can also be imagined that the divergence at a finite scale of a real initial coupling should also be pertinent to this .",
    "moreover , note that the negative @xmath144 is just the direction of the fopt instead of the third - order transition .",
    "however , before a solid solution to the divergence and imaginary problems , the present theory remains a hypothesis , though we have shown clearly its relevance to the fopts .",
    "we have basically repeated the whole theory of critical phenomena in the @xmath5 theory for fopts in an attempt to stress their similarity and differences . instead of lengthy proofs",
    "we have tried to illustrate known general rules with direct examples .",
    "we have studied in detail the mean - field theory , the gaussian theory , the perturbation expansion , and the rg theory . finite - time scaling and leading corrections to scaling have also been considered .",
    "we have also touched on the yang ",
    "lee edge singularity and employed its results to improve our estimates of the instability exponents .",
    "the main results are as follows .    in the mean - field approximation",
    ", we have shown that , for a scalar @xmath1 model below its @xmath11 , the fopt at the spinodal point driven by an external field is governed by the transition at the instability point of the corresponding @xmath5 model , although the fopt and the third - order transition between the two states described by the @xmath5 theory fall into opposite ground states and appear different . via finite - time scaling , numerical results and analytical solutions indeed confirm the relevance of the instability exponents instead of the critical exponents .",
    "the gaussian theory shows clearly that both the correlation length and the correlation time diverge at the instability point similar to the case of the critical phenomena .",
    "in addition , all the mean - field instability exponents have been derived conventionally .",
    "the perturbation expansion around the mean - field theory then demonstrates as expected that infrared divergences plague and thus necessitate an rg theory for @xmath147 , while the mean - field results survive for @xmath129 and only outside the unstable region for @xmath128 .",
    "the power counting analysis shows that in the unstable region and for @xmath128 , the effective local field @xmath5 theory does reproduce the sum of the most divergent contributions order by order in the mean - field expansion .",
    "detailed computations of the renormalization functions to one - loop order and derivations and solutions of the rg equations for a general vertex function and the magnetic field then show unambiguously that there is a pair of complex - conjugate imaginary fixed points that are infrared stable similar to the critical fixed point and thus control the large - scale universal behavior .",
    "exact scaling forms and scaling laws among the instability exponents have been derived and the latter have been computed to one - loop order . in six dimensions ,",
    "these instability exponents recover the mean - field ones , which shows again that the fixed points , albeit imaginary , indeed describes correctly the large - scale fluctuations at the instability point at which the real mean - field transition takes place .",
    "we have computed two particular explicit forms of the renormalized massless two - point response function to one - loop order .",
    "the finite - time scaling form and associated exponents have also been derived , which serve as an accessible method to probe the instability point .",
    "we have derived the leading corrections to scaling and confirmed that they are controlled by a universal exponent .",
    "we have also shown that the infrared behavior of the @xmath5 theory of the fopts falls in the same universality class to the yang ",
    "lee edge singularity though the former is for @xmath148 but the latter for @xmath149 .",
    "this implies that the @xmath117 expansions can be trusted and the @xmath1 interaction is irrelevant .",
    "moreover , the two- and three - loop - order exponents of the edge singularity have been employed to estimate the instability exponents .",
    "the outcomes agree well with previous numerical results , confirming again the relevance of the @xmath5 theory to fopts .",
    "it appears that this relevancy is unlikely just a crossover behavior . on the one hand , although the rg flow with a purely real initial coupling diverges at a finite scale , an imaginary part generates beyond that scale and the imaginary fixed point can then be reached . on the other hand ,",
    "if the initial coupling acquires a finite imaginary part of whatever magnitude , true asymptotic behavior can be surely established .",
    "we speculate that the imaginary nature of the fixed points may be a natural consequence of the instability of the @xmath5 theory .",
    "however , further studies are clearly needed .",
    "we conclude therefore that the instability fixed points with their instability exponents of the @xmath5 theory are clearly relevant to the scaling and universality behavior exhibited by fopts near their instability points .",
    "further studies are desirable to dispel possible concern with the instability point , to clarify the divergence of the rg flow and the imaginary nature of the fixed points , to search for new classes , as well as to find experimental evidences .",
