    "in recent years , quantum dot ( qd ) systems , as a potential artificial thermoelectric material , have attracted much attention and their thermoelectric properties have been widely studied both experimentally @xcite and theoretically@xcite . due to deviation from the wiedemann - franz law and suppression of the phonon contributions , thermoelectric efficiency in qd systems",
    "can be significantly enhanced@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , many interesting thermoelectric effects have been observed or predicted in single qd and double quantum dots ( dqds ) systems in the coulomb blockade ( cb ) regime@xcite and kondo regime@xcite .",
    "for example , the thermopower and the thermal conductance as a function of gate voltage present cb oscillations@xcite .",
    "the transient thermopower of a single qd system can be strongly enhanced and modified under a time - dependent gate voltage@xcite . in a single qd with multilevels@xcite or a serial - coupled dqds@xcite , the thermal conductance can be strongly enhanced at high temperature due to the bipolar effects , leading to strong suppression of thermoelectric efficiency .",
    "when interference effects are considered in parallel coupled dqds system , the thermoelectric efficiency can be significantly enhanced by fano effect and coulomb interaction@xcite . in particular , the strong dependence of thermopower on temperature and gate voltage provide a sensitive way to detect and understand the kondo correlations@xcite .",
    "the recent experimental observation of the spin seebeck effect@xcite inspires the research on spin effects in energy transport in qd systems@xcite and opens a new view of thermal manipulation of spintronic devices and the design of spin current generator .",
    "spin - dependent thermoelectric effects in the single qd and dqds system connected to two ferromagnetic leads with collinear or noncollinear magnetic configurations is widely studied in the linear and nonlinear response regime@xcite .",
    "the results indicate that the thermoelectric coefficients are strongly dependent on the spin polarization , the relative magnetic configurations of ferromagnetic leads and the asymmetry of dot - lead coupling .",
    "as mentioned by jzef barna@xcite , due to long spin - relaxation time , the spin accumulation in leads induces spin - dependent splitting of the chemical potential in the leads . as a result",
    ", the spin efficiency can be larger than the charge efficiency and a pure spin thermopower can be obtained@xcite . up to now ,",
    "most earlier theoretical works about spin effects in heat transport mainly focused on single qd or parallel coupled dqds system .",
    "more recently , people start to study thermoelectric effects in a serial - coupled dqds system coupled to ferromagnetic leads@xcite .",
    "even so , still much more work is needed to understand interplay between spin effect and heat transport in serial - coupled dqds system , particularly in the presence of the magnetic field or the spin accumulation in leads .    in the present work ,",
    "we consider a lateral dqds with spin - dependent interdot coupling connected to two ferromagnetic electrodes .",
    "spin - dependent interdot coupling can be achieved by applying a static magnetic field on the tunneling junction between two qds and induces the levels spin - dependent splitting .",
    "the tunable system properties further enrich the thermoelectronic and thermo - spin transport properties in dqds system . by using the nonequilibrium green s function technique ,",
    "thermoelectric and thermo - spin coefficients are obtained .",
    "it is found that in parallel configuration the thermoelectric efficiency can achieve considerable values around spin - down resonance levels when the effective interdot coupling and tunnel coupling between qds and the leads for spin - down electrons are small . on the other hand ,",
    "in the presence of the magnetic field , the spin accumulation in leads strongly suppresses the thermoelectric efficiency .",
    "in particular , the thermoelectric and thermo - spin efficiency are strongly enhanced by the intradot coulomb interactions and can reach very high value at an appropriate temperature . moreover , a pure spin thermopower can also be obtained .",
    "the rest of this work is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we introduce the model of lateral dqds system with spin - dependent interdot coupling and derive the basic analytical formulas . in sec.iii , we present the corresponding numerical results about the influence of the related parameters on the thermoelectric and thermospin properties in the present device .",
    "finally , in sec.iv we summarize the work .",
    "we consider a system of lateral dqds with spin - dependent interdot coupling and two ferromagnetic leads .",
    "the magnetizations of the leads are assumed to be collinear , and can be either in the parallel or antiparallel configuration .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the system can be decomposed into three parts , @xmath0 , @xmath1 .",
    "the first term describes the isolated dqds and is given by,@xmath2",
    "\\label{1}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the operator @xmath3 @xmath4 creates ( annihilates ) an electron with energy @xmath5 and spin @xmath6 in qd @xmath7 .",
    "we assume that the level spacing is very large so that we can only consider a single energy level in each qd .",
    "@xmath8 is intradot coulomb interaction constant and @xmath9 is the particle number operator .",
    "the last term sum in eq.(1 ) describes the spin - dependent tunneling between two qds , where @xmath10 is defined as : @xmath11 for @xmath12 or @xmath13 for @xmath14 .",
    "this spin - dependent tunneling strength can be induced by a static magnetic field applied to the barrier region between the two qds .",
    "when electron passes through the potential barrier region , the electron with spin parallel to the magnetic field have a larger tunneling probability than one with spin antiparallel to the magnetic field due to larmor precession of the electron spin inside the potential barrier@xcite .",
    "the second term @xmath15 of hamiltonian describes the noninteracting electrons in the leads and is written as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 creates ( annihilates ) an conduction electron with energy @xmath18 , momentum @xmath19 and spin @xmath6 in the @xmath20 electrode .",
    "the third term of hamiltonian describes the coupling between the dqds and the electrodes and reads @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the hopping matrix - element between the qd @xmath7 and the electrode @xmath20 , which is assumed to be independent of momentum @xmath19 . in the following calculation",
    ", we define the line - width matrix as @xmath23and @xmath24 and in a wide - band limit , @xmath25 is independent of the energy . using the matrix representation , we have@xmath26{cc}% \\gamma_{11l}^{\\sigma } & \\gamma_{12l}^{\\sigma}\\\\ \\gamma_{21l}^{\\sigma } & \\gamma_{22l}^{\\sigma}% \\end{array } \\right )   = \\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{cc}% \\gamma_{1l}^{\\sigma } & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{array } \\right ) \\nonumber\\\\ \\gamma_{r}^{\\sigma }   &   = \\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{cc}% \\gamma_{11r}^{\\sigma } & \\gamma_{12r}^{\\sigma}\\\\ \\gamma_{21r}^{\\sigma } & \\gamma_{22r}^{\\sigma}% \\end{array } \\right )   = \\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{cc}% 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & \\gamma_{2r}^{\\sigma}% \\end{array } \\right )   \\label{2}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "when  the spin polarization of the leads is considered , the matrix - element may be assumed in the form : @xmath29 and @xmath30 with the sign @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) for parallel ( antiparallel ) alignment of the magnetization in two electrodes .",

    "we assume @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .    by using nonequilibrium green s function technique ,",
    "the electronic and heat current from the @xmath20 ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) lead flowing into the qds can be written in the forms@xcite:@xmath40   t_{\\sigma}\\left (   \\omega\\right )   \\label{3}%\\]]@xmath41   t_{\\sigma}\\left (   \\omega\\right ) \\label{4}%\\ ] ] where @xmath42 , @xmath43^{-1}$ ] is the fermi distribution function for the @xmath20 electrode with chemical potential @xmath44 , temperature @xmath45 and boltzmann constant @xmath46 .",

    "it should be pointed that the hartree - fock decoupling approximation scheme is reasonable when the temperature during our calculation is higher than the kondo temperature .    in the linear response regime ,",
    "the spin accumulation in electrodes can be neglected when spin relaxation time is sufficiently short@xcite . in this case , the voltage induced by temperature gradient can be treated as independent of spin .",
    "the electric and heat currents through the system can be written in the form@xmath63@xmath64 with @xmath65 . in the following calculation",
    "we assume the chemical potential @xmath66 and temperature @xmath67 , thus the fermi distribution function @xmath68 .",
    "the electronic and thermal conductances can be calculated by the formula @xmath69 and @xmath70,$ ] respectively .",
    "the thermopower is defined as thermoelectric voltage @xmath71 induced by a temperature gradient @xmath72 under the condition of @xmath73 , _ _",
    "i.e.__@xmath74 @xmath75 .",
    "the efficiency of heat - electricity conversion of the system is described by the dimensionless figure of merit ( fom ) @xmath76 , where @xmath77 denotes the thermal conductance corresponding to the phonon contribution , which is suppressed in such dqd - electrodes structure , and is ignored in the present paper .",
    "if spin relaxation time of systems is sufficiently long , the spin accumulation in electrodes should be considered@xcite , which leads to that the chemical potential difference @xmath78 between the two leads is related to the spin channel .",
    "thus , in this system one can define a spin bias @xmath79 induced by temperature gradient via the formula @xmath80 .",
    "corresponding spin - resolved electric and heat currents can be expressed as @xmath81@xmath82   \\label{11}%\\ ] ] with @xmath83 @xmath84 .",
    "the charge and spin conductance are calculated as @xmath85 $ ] and @xmath86 $ ] , respectively , while thermal conductance is given by @xmath87 $ ] , which is identical to the value without spin accumulation in such a system .",
    "one may introduce from eq.(10 ) the spin - dependent thermopower @xmath88 in spin channel @xmath6 under the condition of current @xmath89 vanishing@xcite .",
    "then the charge and spin thermopower are defined as @xmath90   $ ] and @xmath91   , $ ] respectively",
    ". corresponding charge and spin figure of merit are defined as @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively , which describe heat - to - charge - voltage and heat - to - spin - voltage conversion efficiency of the present system when spin accumulation is considered .",
    "@xmath94 has the form of absolute value because the spin conductance may be negative in some regions .",
    "we now numerically study spin - dependent thermoelectric effects in a dqds system based on the above formula , which will be presented according to three premises : without spin accumulation in the leads and @xmath95 ; without spin accumulation in the leads and @xmath96 ; with spin accumulation in the leads . for the sake of simplicity , we assume two dots have same bare energy levels @xmath5 and are spin degenerate , i.e. @xmath5 @xmath97 , which can be tuned by gate voltage in experiment .",
    "the relevant parameters are chosen as : @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 mev , @xmath101 mev .",
    "consider the case that the magnetizations of the leads are in parallel configuration , there is no spin accumulation in the leads and the intradot coulomb interactions are ignored .",
    "the tunnel coupling between two qds is spin - dependent due to the external magnetic field , such a coupling dqds can be equivalent to a single qd with four spin - dependent levels , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 , which corresponds to poles of the green function @xmath106 given by eq.(7 ) .",
    "these levels are identified as @xmath107 ( u=1,2 ) occupied by spin - up electrons and @xmath108 ( d=3,4 ) occupied by spin - down electrons , and satisfy @xmath109 for chosen parameters .",
    "the influence of splitting @xmath110 of interdot coupling on the thermoelectric transport is shown in fig . 1 .",
    "four resonance peaks appear in the electrical conductance spectrum when the spin - dependent level crosses the fermi level ( @xmath111 ) , see fig .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the variety of @xmath110 only changes the electrical conductance s resonance positions and do not influence its magnitude .",
    "it is found that this hold true for the thermal conductance @xmath112 at low temperature . however , the behavior of @xmath112 is more complicated at relatively high temperature ( shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) ) , and the thermopower @xmath113 and the figure of merit @xmath114 are more sensitive to the variety of @xmath110 .",
    "the antisymmetry , oscillation and sign reversal of @xmath113 also are obtained from fig.1(c ) . as shown in fig .",
    "1(d ) , @xmath114 presents typical double - peak structure .",
    "when @xmath110 increases , for the two peaks of @xmath114 located around @xmath115 , not only their magnitudes augment but also their degree of asymmetry increases .",
    "in particular , @xmath114 exhibits a behavior similar to crossover and can reach very high value when @xmath116is close to @xmath117 ( see the inset of fig .",
    "1(d ) ) . this is because when @xmath116is close to @xmath117 , the levels @xmath118 and @xmath119 get much closer to each other and the spin - down resonance channels are significantly blockaded due to the strong reduce of the interdot tunneling for spin - down electrons . while with @xmath110 increasing the side peaks located at @xmath120 only shift their positions with unchanged the maximum .",
    "next , we study the influence of spin polarization @xmath121 on the thermoelectric transport .",
    "the relevant thermoelectric quantities versus dot s level position @xmath122 for different spin polarization @xmath121 are presented in fig .",
    "when @xmath121 increases , the electrical and thermal conductance peaks ( the thermopower peaks ) located at @xmath123 increase ( decreases ) while the electrical and thermal ones ( the thermopower ones ) located at @xmath115 decrease ( increases ) because @xmath124 , @xmath125 increases and @xmath126 , @xmath127 decreases .",
    "these properties of @xmath128 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 determine the behavior of @xmath114 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "2(d ) , with increasing @xmath121 the @xmath114 near @xmath123 is suppressed while the @xmath114 near @xmath115 is intensively enhanced",
    ". the dependence of @xmath114 on spin polarization in the leads and on spin - dependent levels may be useful for designing spin - dependent thermoelectric devices .",
    "however , it should be noted that when the spin polarization in leads is very high , for example , @xmath129 , the tunneling rate for spin - down electrons is close to zero leading to significant suppression of transport through the spin - down levels and thus the corresponding @xmath114 peaks rapidly decrease with increase of @xmath121 , which can be clearly seen from the inset ( 2 ) of fig .",
    "2(d ) .    when the magnetic configuration changes from parallel to antiparallel , the electrical conductances are suppressed for four resonance channels , but the changes of the thermal conductance @xmath112 and the thermopower @xmath113 are dependent of the resonance levels ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) lowers ( heightens ) for the spin - up resonance channels and heightens ( lowers ) for the spin - down resonance channels . as a result ,",
    "@xmath114 in antiparallel configuration presents higher peaks around the spin - up resonance channels and lower peaks around spin - down resonance channels comparing with in parallel configuration . for antiparallel configuration ,",
    "the tunneling rates between the leads and the qds satisfy @xmath130 , which leads to the transmission coefficient @xmath131 is spin - independent .",
    "then the thermoelectric quantities have the same intensities at different resonance points . although the electric and thermal conductance experience an decreasing trend with increasing @xmath121 , the thermopower and the figure of merit are independent of @xmath121 .",
    "based on the discussions above , in order to obtain high thermoelectric efficiency one should tune the resonances points to spin - down levels and take @xmath132 in parallel configuration for fixed temperature and splitting of interdot coupling .",
    "now we focus on the case taking into account the intradot coulomb interactions . under the hartree - fock approximation , such a coupling dqds system",
    "can be equivalent to a single qd with eight energy levels , in which four levels are occupied by spin - up electrons and other four are occupied by spin - down electrons@xcite . to determine the eight spin - dependent effective energy levels one",
    "need self - consistently solve the equation @xmath133^{-1}\\right\\vert = 0 $ ] due to @xmath96 .",
    "4 presents the relevant thermoelectric quantities versus the dots level position @xmath122 with different temperature and @xmath134 . at low temperature eight resonance peaks of @xmath128 and @xmath112",
    "can be clearly seen from fig .",
    "4(a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the peaks @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 ( @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 ) correspond to the electron transport through spin - up ( down ) resonance channels . with the temperature increasing the conductance peaks become wider and lower due to broadening of the fermi distribution function .",
    "more interestingly , at high temperature , the thermal conductance presents five high peaks due to the bipolar effects@xcite .",
    "@xmath113 and @xmath114 experience a nonmonotonous variation trend with increasing temperature ( see fig .",
    "1(c ) , ( d ) ) . in particular , at high temperature , two high peaks of @xmath114 appear near symmetry point @xmath143 , resulting from a suppression of @xmath112 and an enhancement of @xmath113 . comparing with the case in the absence @xmath8 , it can be found that coulomb interactions shift the positions of the peaks of @xmath114 and strongly enhance @xmath114 . as shown in the insert of fig .",
    "4(d ) , the maximum of @xmath114 increases with coulomb interactions increasing and can reach very high values above 30 at an appropriate temperature , which is very useful for the thermoelectric energy conversion devices .",
    "it should be mentioned that with varying the relative magnetic configurations and the spin polarization of leads , the relevant thermoelectric quantities exhibit same variation trend as that without coulomb interactions except for peaks around @xmath143 , which are unaffected .      for the systems with long spin relaxation time",
    ", the spin accumulation in electrodes should be considered@xcite .",
    "5 presents the thermoelectric coefficients versus @xmath122 in the presence of spin accumulation .",
    "it is found by comparing fig.(3 ) with fig.(5 ) that the spin accumulation in electrodes has no influences on the electrical conductance and the thermal conductivity ( not shown ) but strongly influences on the thermopower and the figure of merit .",
    "the peaks of @xmath144 and @xmath145 are much lower than the appropriate peaks in @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "these properties are quite different from those in the absence of external magnetic field , i.e. the splitting of interdot coupling @xmath146 . since the levels are strongly spin - dependent in such system , the spin fom experiences the same variation trend as charge fom with varying the relative magnetic configurations and the spin polarization of leads , and the behaviors are similar to the case without spin accumulation discussed above .",
    "some novel properties also appear , for instance , in the absence of coulomb interactions , @xmath147 at resonance points @xmath115 while @xmath148 at resonance points @xmath120 ( see fig .",
    "5(a ) ) . more interestingly , for certain @xmath122 ( pointed by arrow and being around @xmath149 in fig .",
    "5(b ) ) , the charge thermopower vanishes while the spin thermopower can be finite because the thermopowers for different spin have same value but opposite sign , which means that a pure spin current without charge current may be produced by a temperature gradient in our system .",
    "this feature can also be obtained in the spectrum of figure of merit in fig .",
    "when the coulomb interaction is considered , near the symmetry point @xmath145 exhibits two very high peaks while @xmath94 completely vanishes .",
    "this is because the thermopower for different spin have the same value and sign leading to the enhancement of charge thermopower and the suppression of the spin thermopower .",
    "even so , @xmath145 and @xmath94 are strongly enhanced by the coulomb interactions , and @xmath94 can be larger than @xmath145 for selected dots level positions in coulomb blockade regime .",
    "this implies our proposed system is a good heat - to - spin - voltage converter .",
    "in summary , we studied spin effects in thermoelectric transport through a lateral dqds system with spin dependent interdot coupling and ferromagnetic electrodes . it is found that in parallel configuration the thermoelectric efficiency can achieve considerable values around spin - down resonance levels when the effective interdot coupling and tunnel coupling between qds and the leads for spin - down electrons are small . on the other hand , in the presence of the magnetic field , the spin accumulation in leads strongly suppresses the thermoelectric efficiency .",
    "the thermoelectric and thermo - spin efficiency are strongly enhanced by the intradot coulomb interactions and can reach very high value at an appropriate temperature . moreover , in such a dqds system a pure spin thermopower can be obtained .",
