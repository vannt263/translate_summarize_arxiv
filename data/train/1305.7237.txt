    "providing a complete census of the obscured active galactic nuclei ( agn ) population is crucial to fully understand the cosmological growth of supermassive black holes ( smbh ) and to reveal the physical nature of the smbh - galaxy co - evolution ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a population of heavily obscured agn at cosmological distances is required to explain the shape of the cosmic x - ray background spectrum as shown by the latest agn population synthesis models ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "deep hard x - ray surveys with _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ ( up to @xmath1110 kev ) have provided the most complete and unbiased samples of agn spanning a broad range of luminosities and redshifts ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , there is strong observational evidence that even the deepest x - ray surveys conducted to date are incomplete for agn with heavy obscuration ( line of sight neutral hydrogen column densities @xmath12 ) and they miss many of the objects with compton - thick ( @xmath13 ) obscuration ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "compton - thick agn could represent a fraction as large as @xmath1120 - 30% of the entire agn population ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in this",
    "context surveys at mid - infrared ( mir ) wavelengths ( @xmath145@xmath15 m ) are much less affected by extinction .",
    "since most of the absorbed agn energy is re - emitted in the mir , surveys at these wavelengths can potentially recover the elusive obscured accretion missed by x - ray surveys ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _",
    "( @xmath0 ; @xcite ) has completed the first sensitive survey of the entire sky at 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 , and 22@xmath15 m providing an unprecedented dataset at mir wavelengths .",
    "agn population studies with @xmath0 are starting to fill the gap between local / deep mir surveys with _",
    "iras_/_spitzer _ in regions of the parameter space poorly sampled .",
    "mir selection techniques rely on identifying objects with red power - law seds , the characteristic signature of hot dust heated by the intense radiation field of the agn ( @xcite ) .",
    "several works in the literature have already demonstrated that using @xmath0 colours alone it is possible to separate stars and normal / star - forming galaxies from luminous agn ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in ( * ? ? ? * hereafter m12 ) we presented an mir colour - based selection of luminous agn candidates using the 3.4 , 4.6 , and 12@xmath15 m bands of @xmath0 .",
    "the reliability and effectiveness of the technique were evaluated using the 258 hard ( @xmath54.5 kev ) x - ray - selected agn from the bright ultrahard _ xmm - newton _ survey ( buxs ; m12 ) .",
    "surveys such as @xmath6 are the most efficient and complete way of tracing the accretion phenomenon in the universe at column densities approaching the compton - thick limit ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we demonstrated that our technique , aimed to identify objects with red mir spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , is highly reliable and very effective for the detection of ( x - ray ) luminous agn . at @xmath16 in the range @xmath17-@xmath18 , 96.1@xmath19% and 75.0@xmath20% of the @xmath6 type 1 and type 2 agn",
    "meet the selection , respectively .",
    "interestingly , we found that hard x - ray surveys preferentially miss the @xmath0 agn candidates with the reddest mir colours .",
    "objects such as these are the best candidates to account , at least in part , for the obscured / absorbed luminous agn largely missed by x - ray surveys . the hard x - ray signal obtained from stacking analyses of x - ray non - detected infrared agn candidates suggests that in these objects the nuclear emission is obscured by heavy / compton - thick material ( e.g. @xcite ) .    however , there is still little knowledge on the nature and properties of the agn populations identified with @xmath0 and , more importantly , the impact of heavy nuclear obscuration on the effectiveness of @xmath0 selection techniques , even at high luminosities . to get insight into these issues",
    "we have evaluated the effectiveness of our mir selection technique for the largest catalogue of 887 type 2 quasars ( qso2s ) at @xmath3@xmath100.83 in the literature from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) .",
    "the objects were selected based on their high @xmath1}$]@xmath25007 line luminosities , l@xmath21}$]@xmath22 . as @xmath1}$ ] fluxes are largely unaffected by agn nuclear absorption / obscuration , this sample of luminous qso2s should not be biased against heavily obscured objects .",
    "therefore , we can use this dataset to evaluate whether agn selection techniques with @xmath0 are able to identify luminous obscured agn at @xmath3@xmath101 missed in x - ray surveys .",
    "furthermore , to get insight into the nature of the @xmath0 agn candidates , especially those objects with red infrared seds not detected in x - rays , we studied the properties ( infrared colour distributions and median rest - frame uv - to - mir seds ) of the agn independently selected in x - ray and optical surveys using the data from @xmath6 and the sdss qso2 catalogue .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 briefly summarizes the data sets . in section 3",
    "we determine the effectiveness of our infrared selection technique for the full sample of sdss qso2s and for those objects identified in the literature as compton - thick candidates , and we compare it with the results obtained for the x - ray selected agn in the @xmath6 survey . in section 4 we compare the distributions of @xmath0 colours for the different classes of agn and we compute and present the properties of their median seds . in section 5",
    "we discuss the main results of our analysis .",
    "the results are summarized in section 6 . throughout this paper errors",
    "are 90% confidence for a single parameter ( @xmath23=2.71 ) unless otherwise stated .",
    "we estimated the most probable value for the fractions using a bayesian approach and the binomial distribution from @xcite and the quoted errors are the narrowest interval that includes the mode and encompasses 90% of the probability .",
    "the terms  red \" and  blue \" refer to increasing or decreasing fluxes in @xmath24 at longer wavelengths , respectively .",
    "we adopt the concordance cosmology , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "here we use the largest catalogue of type 2 quasars in the literature derived from the sdss ( @xcite ; @xcite ) spectroscopic database ( @xcite ; hereafter r08 ) .",
    "the catalogue includes objects with uv / optical narrow emission lines only and with line ratios characteristic of non - stellar ionizing radiation . as shown by @xcite",
    ", standard agn photoionization models can reproduce successfully the main emission - line ratio diagnostic diagrams at least at high @xmath1}$ ] luminosities .",
    "the r08 catalogue includes only objects with l@xmath21}$]@xmath28 and @xmath3@xmath290.83 to ensure that the @xmath1}$]@xmath25007 line is present in the sdss spectra .",
    "the r08 catalogue includes both gaussian and non - parametric @xmath1}$ ] line measurements , the latter ( used to define the luminosity cut ) being systematically larger by 5% on average . in this paper l@xmath21}$ ] refers to luminosities estimated from gaussian fits .",
    "the catalogue contains 887 type 2 quasars detected over a survey area of @xmath306293 deg@xmath31 .",
    "from now on , we will refer to this source sample as the sdss qso2s .",
    "the objects in r08 were selected independently of their x - ray properties with a selection that should be unaffected by nuclear obscuration . only a small subset of the sdss qso2s have x - ray information , which is necessary to directly measure the absorption along the line of sight .",
    "detailed analyses of their x - ray properties suggest that , at least at the highest @xmath1}$ ] luminosities , most sdss qso2s are heavily absorbed and an important fraction might be compton - thick ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "similar results are found for @xmath1}$]@xmath25007-selected agn at lower luminosities @xcite .",
    "thus , we can confidently use the sdss qso2 catalogue to evaluate the effectiveness of the infrared agn wedge to select luminous absorbed agn at @xmath3@xmath101 in a way that is relatively free from the potential selection effects of x - ray absorption .",
    "we caution however , that the objects in the r08 catalogue were selected from different sdss spectroscopic target selection algorithms which implies that the selection function is different across the luminosity-@xmath3 range of the sample . at @xmath3@xmath40.3 ( and lower @xmath1}$ ] luminosities ) most sdss qso2s were targeted by the main galaxy algorithm ( based on optical morphology i.e. resolved objects ) while at @xmath3@xmath50.3 ( and higher @xmath1}$ ] luminosities ) the sdss qso2s were mainly targeted by the low-@xmath3 and high-@xmath3 qso ( non - stellar colour selection ) and serendipity first ( radio properties ) algorithms ( see fig . 3 in r08 ) .",
    "we will discuss how this property of the sdss qso2 catalogue might affect our results .",
    "a summary of the sdss spectroscopic target selection algorithms is given in r08 while for more detailed information see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xmath6 is a complete flux - limited sample of bright ( @xmath32 ) `` ultra - hard '' ( 4.5 - 10 kev ) x - ray selected sources detected over a total sky area of 44.43 deg@xmath31 .",

    "these observations , with effective exposure times in the range 10 - 100 ks , were used to derive high precision x - ray extragalactic source count distributions at intermediate fluxes ( @xcite ) . at the time of writing the spectroscopic identification completeness is 97.3% . of the 258 @xmath6 sources , 145 objects ( 56.2% )",
    "are identified as type 1 agn ( showing uv / optical emission line velocity widths @xmath341500 @xmath35 ) and 106 ( 41.1% ) as type 2 agn ( showing uv / optical emission line velocity widths @xmath291500 @xmath35 or a galaxy spectrum with no emission lines ) while 7 sources ( 2.7% ) remain unidentified .",
    "@xmath6 covers 4 decades in x - ray luminosity ( @xmath36 ) and extends up to @xmath3@xmath112 .",
    "x - ray luminosities are computed in the `` standard '' 2 - 10 kev rest - frame energy band .",
    "they were derived from a detailed analysis of the x - ray spectra of the objects and they are corrected for intrinsic absorption .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      at the wavelengths sampled by our data the contribution from the host galaxy to the median sed of the sdss qso2s is more important than in the @xmath6 type 2 agn .",
    "an acceptable fit could only be obtained with a composite sed where a reddened agn continuum ( best - fit @xmath37 or @xmath38@xmath111 assuming the smc dust - to - gas ratio ; @xcite ) , stellar emission and features associated with star formation activity contribute to the observed fluxes .",
    "the best - fit was obtained with the star - forming galaxy sed of m82 ( @xmath39=2.2 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , bottom ) .",
    "still the mir emission in these objects is dominated by the agn .",
    "this is expected as the median sed was derived for the sdss qso2s in the infrared agn wedge .    at optical / near - infrared wavelengths both the agn and stellar emission",
    "are required to provide a good quality fit although the agn contribution is not as important as in the @xmath6 type 2 agn .",
    "none of the star - forming templates in the library of @xcite can fit the near - infrared stellar bump .",
    "the most plausible explanation for this result is that we are combining the seds of a large number of objects with a range in host galaxy properties .",
    "we also checked that the qso2 template from @xcite also provides a good quality fit to the data points at mir wavelengths , reaching similar conclusions .    in sec .",
    "[ colours ] , from the comparison of the log(@xmath40 ) colour distributions of the @xmath6 type 1 and type 2 agn and the sdss qso2s , we found a trend where higher ( line of sight ) absorption might be associated with redder infrared colours .",
    "however we have shown that , even for luminous agn in the infrared agn wedge , host galaxy contamination of the @xmath0 fluxes can have an effect on the observed properties of the objects .",
    "our results suggest that it is not the possible presence of compton - thick agn that determines the red mir continuum of the sdss qso2s but most likely the properties of their host galaxies .",
    "the results of the analysis of the median seds of the sdss qso2s are entirely consistent with those obtained from _ spitzer _",
    "mir spectroscopy of qso2s selected from optical sdss observations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the mir spectra of these objects show a large diversity of properties .",
    "while some objects show a featureless continuum , star formation activity is detected in most qso2s although the mir emission is dominated by the agn . in the study of a sample of sdss galaxies at @xmath3@xmath290.3",
    "@xcite suggested a connection between the agn power and star formation activity .",
    "a young stellar population and signatures of recent bursts of star formation are a general property for the most powerfull qso2s .",
    "a similar result was found by @xcite for sdss selected type 1 agn at @xmath3@xmath290.75 .",
    "this is consistent with our finding that star formation is a general property in the most luminous ( the sources that preferentially enter the infrared agn wedge ) sdss qso2s .      as noted in sec .",
    "[ seds ] ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) the sdss qso2s have more pronounced near - infrared stellar bumps .",
    "we explain this as a selection effect due to the tight magnitude limits applied by the sdss spectroscopic target selection algorithms . for example",
    ", the galaxy algorithm selects resolved objects with petrosian magnitudes @xmath41@xmath2917.77 mag while the low-@xmath3 and high-@xmath3 qso algorithms target objects with point spread function ( psf ) magnitudes 15@xmath29@xmath42@xmath2919.1 and 15@xmath29@xmath42@xmath2920.2 , respectively .",
    "the serendipity first algorithm selects sources with fiber magnitudes 14@xmath29@xmath43@xmath2920.5 . for comparison",
    ", the @xmath6 agn span a much broader range of optical magnitudes , 15@xmath4423.5 , where @xmath41 refers to sdss psf magnitudes . because the host galaxy stellar emission is an important component at uv / optical wavelengths in type 2 agn , the magnitude limits of the sdss spectroscopy are likely biasing the samples towards type 2 objects with more luminous ( more massive ) hosts .",
    "this can reduce the completeness of the infrared agn wedge for selection of sdss qso2s as such techniques preferentially miss agn in massive hosts .",
    "this is actually what we find when comparing the effectiveness of the infrared agn wedge for the @xmath6 type 2 agn and the sdss qso2s ( see sec .  [ comparison ] ) :",
    "the selection completeness for the sdss qso2s is lower than that of the buxs type 2 agn , at least in the low luminosity regime .    to illustrate the host galaxy dilution effect we show in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] the median seds for the sdss qso2s at @xmath3@xmath40.3 ( left ) and @xmath3@xmath50.3 ( right ) that are in / out the infrared agn wedge ( normalized at 6@xmath15 m rest - frame ) , respectively . the objects outside the infrared agn wedge reside in more massive hosts .",
    "the host galaxy emission contaminates the @xmath0 fluxes at the shortest wavelengths , an effect that becomes more important at higher @xmath3 due to the k - correction .",
    "based on the existing data we do not find significant differences in the mir continuum of the sdss qso2s in and out the infrared agn wedge .",
    "although we can not quantify the role of dust extinction in shaping the mir spectra , we would expect that star formation features would be stronger in the objects with more massive galaxies .",
    "obscured agn normally reside in optically luminous massive galaxies ( stellar masses @xmath45 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "if the sdss qso2s follow the correlation between the specific star formation rate , i.e the star formation rate per unit stellar mass , and @xmath46 in local star - forming galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) it is reasonable to expect the detection of star formation signatures in these objects .",
    "we note that obscuration by gas in the host galaxy on scales of hundreds of parsecs ( e.g. starbursts , edge - on discs ) might also be responsible for the uv / optical reddening measured in the median seds of the @xmath6 type 2 agn and the sdss qso2s .",
    "observational evidence for this effect is supported by studies of the host galaxy properties of optically selected agn ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "for example , the study of @xcite , based on the sdss spectroscopic survey , finds a tendency for type 1 agn to reside on face - on systems while type 2 objects , especially those with high @xmath1}$ ] equivalent widths , reside preferentially on edge - on systems .",
    "thus , host galaxy obscuration might have a more important role in the sdss qso2s than in the @xmath6 type 2 agn .",
    "finally , we stress that it is unlikely that qso2 samples based on the @xmath1}$ ] line emission , such as the r08 catalogue , are biased towards objects with more intense star formation activity .",
    "as shown in @xcite , @xmath1}$]@xmath25007 emission is relatively weak in metal - rich star - forming galaxies , with star formation contributing only a few percent to the @xmath1}$ ] fluxes .",
    "a more recent work by @xcite finds no strong evidence that @xmath1}$ ] selection is biased towards agn with strong star formation activity .",
    "hard x - ray surveys ( @xmath5a few kev ) provide the most complete and reliable census of agn since they suffer little contamination from processes not related to smbh activity , missing only compton - thick sources . as hard x - ray emission is not affected by host galaxy dilution , these surveys can identify the agn residing in the most massive galaxies and/or with more intense star formation and can identify a large population of low luminosity agn .    on the other hand , @xmath1}$]@xmath25007 selection is less sensitive to circumnuclear obscuration .",
    "therefore , it is an efficient and powerful technique to provide a more complete view of the heavily obscured and compton - thick agn population .",
    "however , such selection depends on empirical emission - line ratio diagnostic diagrams which are known to missidentify many faint agn in star - forming galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , a significant fraction of x - ray selected agn , mainly at @xmath47 , have optical spectra dominated by the host galaxy and without signatures of agn activity ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus , @xmath1}$]-based surveys suffer from effects associated with host galaxy dilution .",
    "they will be incomplete at low luminosities and for objects in which the narrow line region is heavily extincted .",
    "mir based surveys are a promising technique to identify absorbed agn missed in x - ray surveys , as most of the absorbed radiation should be re - emited by dust at these wavelengths .",
    "the results presented in this paper support that @xmath0 colour - based mir selection techniques are able to identify luminous heavily absorbed and even compton - thick agn at least up to @xmath3@xmath101 . the best candidates are those objects in the infrared agn wedge with the reddest mir colours .",
    "however , it is important to note that mir selection identifies predominantly luminous agn . at low luminosities , especially for those objects with large extinction at rest - frame infrared wavelengths , the selection is largely incomplete and strongly biased against agn residing in massive and/or star - forming hosts .",
    "this will be more important at higher @xmath3 due to the k - correction .",
    "this observational bias needs to be taken into account for example when studying the coevolution of smbh and their host galaxies .",
    "the main goal of this work was to evaluate whether agn selection techniques in the infrared with @xmath0 , such as the infrared agn wedge presented in m12 , are able to identify with high efficiency absorbed agn missed in x - rays .",
    "we also studied the properties of the agn populations independently selected in x - ray and optical surveys .",
    "to this aim we used the largest catalogue of optically selected qso2s at @xmath3@xmath40.83 in sdss .",
    "these objects were selected on the basis of their high @xmath1}$]@xmath25007 line luminosities , l@xmath21}$]@xmath48 .",
    "such a selection should be relatively unbiased against heavy obscuration .",
    "we then compared the results with those for the hard ( @xmath54.5 kev ) x - ray selected agn in the @xmath6 survey .",
    "the fraction of sdss qso2s in the infrared agn wedge is a strong function of the agn luminosity . in total , 53.3@xmath493% of all the sdss qso2s with detection in all the three shortest wavelength bands of @xmath0 fall in the infrared agn wedge .",
    "this fraction increases to @xmath7 at the highest @xmath1}$ ] luminosities , from @xmath112.2@xmath50 to 2.5@xmath51 .",
    "this is substantially lower than for the @xmath6 type 1 agn in the same luminosity range , but it is consistent within the uncertainties , with that obtained for the @xmath6 type 2 agn .    to evaluate whether our infrared selection technique identifies compton - thick agn ,",
    "we compiled a sample of sdss qso2s identified as compton - thick candidates in the literature .",
    "we found that the fraction of sdss qso2s that are compton - thick candidates and fall in the infrared agn wedge is consistent , within the uncertainties , with the fraction of objects in the full sample that fall in that zone ( @xmath52 versus @xmath53 ) .",
    "furthermore , at the agn luminosities involved in the comparison , compton - thick and compton - thin sdss qso2s have similar @xmath0 colour distributions .    considering only the objects in the infrared agn wedge to minimize host galaxy contamination",
    ", we found that the buxs type 1 agn have bluer log(@xmath40 ) colours than the type 2 agn , and the sdss qso2s trace the objects with the reddest colours .",
    "the sdss qso2s trace better than x - ray selection the x - ray undetected @xmath0 agn candidates in the @xmath6 survey area with the reddest colours in the wedge .",
    "these results suggest a trend where higher ( line of sight ) absorption might be associated with redder log(@xmath40 ) colours .",
    "to understand the nature and properties of the agn candidates identified with @xmath0 we analysed the median uv - to - mir rest - frame seds of the agn in buxs and the sdss qso2s in the infrared agn wedge .",
    "both an extincted agn continuum and host galaxy stellar emission , are required to fully account for the rest - frame uv / optical / near - infrared seds of the @xmath6 type 2 agn and sdss qso2s . even for the sdss qso2s",
    "the measured extinction is not sufficiently large to fully suppress the nuclear emission at these wavelengths .",
    "the sdss qso2s have more pronounced near - infrared stellar bumps than both the type 1 and type 2 agn in @xmath6 .",
    "the tight magnitude limits applied by the sdss spectroscopic target algorithms , especially at @xmath3@xmath40.3 , are likely biasing type 2 agn samples towards objects with more luminous ( more massive ) hosts .",
    "it does not appear that either @xmath3 or luminosity effects can explain these differences .",
    "the mir continuum of both the @xmath6 agn and sdss qso2s is dominated by the agn component .",
    "no clear features of star - forming activity were detected in the mir median seds of the @xmath6 type 1 and type 2 agn .",
    "however mir excess emission is a general property of the sdss qso2s .",
    "we interpret this as features associated with star - forming activity in the agn host galaxies .",
    "the combination of extinction at rest - frame optical / near - infrared wavelengths and contamination from the more massive host galaxies at the longest mir wavelengths naturally explains the red @xmath0 colours and mir continua of the sdss qso2s .",
    "host galaxy dilution is an important effect at mir wavelengths that may strongly bias the agn populations identified with @xmath0 colour - based techniques , especially at low luminosities , against agn in very massive / star - forming hosts .",
    "we conclude that at high luminosities and @xmath3@xmath101 our mir selection technique is very efficient at identifying both compton - thin and compton - thick agn . although optical / near - infrared spectroscopy is essential to reveal the true nature of infrared - selected agn , as pointed out in m12 , the best @xmath0 candidates to account , at least in part , for the absorbed luminous agn missed in x - rays are the objects with the reddest mir colours in the wedge .",
