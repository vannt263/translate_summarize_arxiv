    "two - photon physics has been traditionally studied at @xmath0 colliders owing to large fluxes of virtual photons associated with the beams . however , at the lhc for the first time the proton beam energy will be so high that the effective luminosity of  collisions will permit performing meaningful and important experiments .",
    "the measurements of high - energy  collisions at the lhc are intrinsically very interesting , and to large extend are complementary to the ` base - line ' @xmath1 studies .    in this paper , an experimental feasibility of tagging two - photon production in proton - proton collisions at the lhc is considered .",
    "the effective  luminosity of the tagged two - photon collisions is evaluated and used to estimate the physics potential for such measurements .",
    "for majority of two - photon processes the equivalent photon ( or weizscker - williams ) approximation ( epa ) can be successfully applied @xcite . in epa",
    "two - photon production at the lhc proceeds in two steps : first , two photons are emitted by incoming protons and then , the photons collide producing a system @xmath2 while the protons remain intact in the @xmath3 production , @xmath4 , or one of them dissociates into a state @xmath5 in the @xmath6 production , @xmath7 . hence , the proton - proton cross - section is a product of the photon - photon cross - section and two photon spectra : @xmath8    in epa the photon spectrum is a function of the photon energy @xmath9 and its virtuality @xmath10 @xcite : [ eq:2 ] dn= , where @xmath11 is the fine - structure constant , @xmath12 is the incoming proton energy and the minimum photon virtuality @xmath13\\omega / e$ ] , where @xmath14 is the proton mass and @xmath15 is the invariant mass of the final state @xmath5 . for the elastic production , assuming the dipole approximation for proton form factors , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and @xmath18 . for the inelastic production @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the proton structure function and @xmath22 .",
    "the spectrum is strongly peaked at low @xmath9 , therefore the photon - photon center of mass energy @xmath23 is usually much smaller than the total center of mass energy which equals @xmath24  tev . for the elastic production the photon virtuality is usually low , @xmath25  gev@xmath26 ,",
    "therefore the proton scattering angle is very small , @xmath27rad .     at the lhc , for the range of photon energy and virtuality , 5  gev  @xmath28  gev and @xmath29  gev@xmath26.,width=566 ]    the luminosity spectrum of photon - photon collisions , @xmath30 ,",
    "can be introduced in epa by integration of the product of the photon spectra given by eq .",
    "[ eq:2 ] over the photon virtualities and energies keeping fixed @xmath31 . as an example , in fig .",
    "[ fig : lumi ] , assuming for each photon an integration interval of 5  gev@xmath32 and @xmath29  gev@xmath26 , @xmath30 and its integral @xmath33 are shown for the elastic production as a function of @xmath31 and the lower integration limit , @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "the integrated spectrum directly gives a fraction of the @xmath1 lhc luminosity available for the photon - photon collisions at @xmath35 .",
    "it is remarkable that for @xmath36  gev this fraction is close to 1% , and for the nominal @xmath1 luminosity of @xmath37  @xmath38s@xmath39 the  luminosity at @xmath40  gev is @xmath41  @xmath38s@xmath39 . for the inelastic two - photon production @xmath30 is even larger and will be discussed below .",
    "tagging two - photon production at the lhc would serve two purposes .",
    "first , when both elastically scattered protons are detected ( _ double tag _ ) the  center of mass energy @xmath31 can be measured independently and improve an overall reconstruction of the final state @xmath2 .",
    "secondly , tagging is needed in order to suppress backgrounds and to obtain a clean two - photon data sample .",
    "in particular , the proton scattering angle can be used to extract the two - photon signal both for the double and _ single _ tags when only one very forward proton is detected .    at the nominal running conditions the lhc beam at the interaction point ( ip ) has the gaussian lateral widths @xmath42=@xmath43=@xmath44 m and the angular divergence in horizontal and vertical planes @xmath45=@xmath46=@xmath47rad . however , for the initial running at medium luminosity of @xmath48  @xmath38s@xmath39 almost two times smaller lateral beam size as well as the angular divergence at the ip are expected . at the same time , the event pile - up at the central detectors is not prohibitively large .",
    "the beam energy spread will be @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "the beam divergence is comparable with the typical proton scattering angle in the two - photon processes hence effectively protons leave the ip at zero - angle .",
    "these protons have however smaller energy than the beam protons and are more strongly deflected in the beam - line magnetic field .",
    "the standard method of measuring such forward scattered protons utilizes so - called roman - pots , position sensitive detectors installed far away from the ip in the beam vacuum to allow the closest possible approach to a beam .",
    "the detector layouts for the roman - pot detectors so far considered by the totem @xcite and atlas @xcite collaborations , mainly in the context of the total and elastic @xmath1 cross - section measurements at the lhc , result in a significant acceptance for zero - angle protons which lost at least a few % of their initial energy .",
    "it would correspond to the tagged photon energies of several hundred gev and would therefore limit the studies of two - photon production only to a domain of very large @xmath31 .",
    "however , to improve sensitivity to very low angle elastic @xmath1 scattering , it was recently proposed @xcite to add new detector stations more far away ( @xmath50  m ) from the ip .",
    "this is also an excellent place for tagging two - photon production since at this location , for the nominal lhc beam optics in the horizontal plane , the so - called betatron phase advance is @xmath51 , the beam size has a minimum , and the dispersion @xmath52 is large , about 100  mm .",
    "it means that in the horizontal plane a detector can approach the beam very closely and at the same time the average horizontal displacement @xmath53 with respect to the beam axis due to the proton energy loss is large , @xmath54 . therefore , measurement of @xmath53 gives directly the tagged photon energy .",
    "additionally , the angle between the proton momentum and the beam axis , @xmath55 , is proportional to the same angle at the ip , @xmath56 . on the other hand , in the vertical plane",
    "the betatron phase advance is @xmath57 at this location , therefore the angle @xmath58 is proportional to the proton vertical displacement at the ip and the vertical proton displacement @xmath59\\simeq0.01\\times\\theta^*_y [ \\mu$]rad ] . hence , the measurement of @xmath55 and @xmath60 directly provide information on proton transverse momentum at the ip , @xmath61 , hence on photon virtuality @xmath62 .     and its integral @xmath33 assuming double tags ( shaded histograms ) and single tags , for all ( solid line ) and only for elastic ( dashed line ) events ; the tagging range is @xmath63  gev and @xmath29  gev@xmath26.,width=566 ]    to ensure enough room for the beam steering and to keep the detectors in a ` shadow ' of beam collimators a 1  mm minimum distance between the detector edge and the beam axis should be assumed @xcite . since the proton beam size in the horizontal plane is small , @xmath64 m , this distance corresponds to more than 20 beam widths , far away from the beam core .",
    "the minimum approach of 1  mm corresponds to the minimum tagged photon energy of 70  gev .",
    "the maximum tagged energy is about 700  gev due to a beam - line geometrical acceptance , and because for such a large energy loss @xmath52 starts to change with the scattered proton energy , making the energy measurement less reliable . assuming this tagged energy range , the photon - photon luminosity spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lumi2 ] , for the double tagging , when both scattered protons are detected as well as for the single tagging , when at least one scattered proton is detected ; photon virtuality is restricted to @xmath29  gev@xmath26 .",
    "it can be noted that the  luminosity spectrum for the double tagging is sizable in the range @xmath65  gev , whereas the single tagging preserves a major fraction of the total elastic  luminosity . including the inelastic contribution to the single tagged spectrum increases @xmath30 approximately by a factor of three , assuming the maximum dissociative mass @xmath15 of 20  gev .",
    "are not observed in the central detectors . ]",
    "the required detector size is small , with a sensitive area of each detector plane of the order of 2  cm@xmath26 , with excellent spatial resolution in the 1020  @xmath67 m range .",
    "there should be two detector stations separated by 24  m to ensure a precise measurement of direction of the proton momentum .",
    "modern silicon micro - strip or pixel sensors are the most probable candidates .",
    "the crucial alignment of the detector sensors with respect to the beam axis should be possible using the elastic @xmath1 events when protons cross several detector planes .",
    "setting the final momentum scale requires a precise knowledge of the integral of the magnetic field along the scattered proton trajectory , however the photon energy scale might be set using the data where the final state @xmath2 is fully detected in the central detectors and a precise and independent determination of @xmath31 is possible .",
    "= 4  gev@xmath68 ; b ) the same distributions smeared by the beam divergence for the initial running conditions .",
    "distributions have the same normalization for @xmath69  gev@xmath70 and correspond to a 100  gev proton energy loss .",
    ", width=566 ]    for the above spatial resolutions , the final resolution on @xmath31 and photon virtualities would be determined by the geometrical beam properties at the ip . in this case , the horizontal displacement due proton energy loss @xmath53 is smeared by @xmath71 m leading to a 5  gev uncertainty on @xmath31=200  gev , for example .",
    "the same reaction , @xmath72 , occurs also in strong interactions , via fusion of two colorless objects , @xmath73 , and will therefore interfere with the two - photon fusion .",
    "however , this so - called central diffraction usually results in much larger transverse momenta of the scattered protons , following the distribution @xmath74 , with the expected at the lhc diffractive slope @xmath75  gev@xmath68  @xcite .",
    "soft pomeron - pomeron interactions have several orders of magnitude larger cross - sections than the  interactions , but for the hard processes the cross - sections are of similar size ( see below ) .",
    "therefore , the measurement of proton @xmath61 is vital for extracting the   signal . in fig .",
    "[ fig : smear ] , the ` true ' and smeared distributions of @xmath76 are compared assuming the same cross - sections integrated over @xmath76 .",
    "it shows that in such a case the two - photon signal is clearly visible and can be well extracted , and for example , for @xmath77  gev@xmath70 the pomeron - pomeron contribution ( neglecting interference effects ) is about 20% .",
    "one should note that for the double tagged events the separation is even more powerful since one can independently use for that purpose @xmath61 of each proton .",
    "the exclusive  production of one or two heavy particles , as for example in @xmath78 or @xmath79 processes , is particularly interesting .",
    "these events are clean  two ( or one ) very forward protons measured far away from the ip and only one or two particles produced and decaying in the central detectors , giving an additional handle for background suppression .    in the exclusive two - photon higgs boson production in leading order the photons couple via a fermion loop which results in sensitivity to any new fermion state , even significantly beyond the @xmath31 scale , hence to possible departures from the standard model ( sm ) physics .",
    "luminosity of 30  fb@xmath39 , assuming double tags ( shaded histograms ) , and single tags for all ( solid line ) and only for elastic ( dashed line ) scattering ; b ) rapidity distribution for the tagged higgs boson production . ,",
    "width=566 ]    the number @xmath80 of the two - photon produced higgs bosons is given by @xcite : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the proton - proton integrated luminosity , @xmath83 is the higgs boson mass and @xmath84 is the @xmath85 width . in fig . [",
    "fig : higgs ] , @xmath80 expected in sm is shown for the integrated @xmath1 luminosity which corresponds to first three years of the lhc running at medium luminosity .",
    "it shows that the double - tagged higgs boson production is statistically very limited at low @xmath83 , but the single - tagged production is not negligible starting already at @xmath83=100  gev .",
    "for the same luminosity more than five thousand ` gold - plated ' double - tagged @xmath79 pairs would be exclusively produced at @xmath40  gev , assuming the asymptotic value of @xmath86  pb .",
    "the corresponding number of the exclusive top pairs is unfortunately more than hundred times smaller .",
    "the exclusive @xmath79 production constitutes also an ` irreducible ' background for the events when higgs boson decays into @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath87  gev the signal @xmath88 seem experimentally more preferable",
    ". given significant backgrounds and low signal statistics , such two - photon measurements can not possibly be used for a higgs boson search , but they would provide an important handle on @xmath84 at the lhc @xcite .    as was mentioned before , the same event topology have also the pomeron - pomeron interactions .",
    "recent studies @xcite show that the pomeron - pomeron exclusive higgs boson production has a similar cross - section to the two - photon case , therefore the two - photon signal can be statistically extracted using the distributions of the proton @xmath61 .",
    "the pomeron - pomeron cross - section is theoretically not well controlled due to soft final - state interactions and the associated _ survival probability_. in contrast , provided that @xmath10 is not too large , the two - photon cross - section is much less sensitive to these effects @xcite . on the other hand , interference between the pomeron - pomeron and  amplitudes",
    "might give information ( in analogy to coulomb and elastic @xmath1 scattering , for example ) about the amplitude behaviour at energies beyond available at the lhc .",
    "of course , the photon - photon measurements would also extend search for the new physics at the lhc .",
    "in particular ,  search for new particles expected in supersymmetric models would be to large extend complementary to the corresponding proton - proton studies @xcite .",
    "many interesting qcd studies should also be possible , as for example measurements of the exclusive production of multi - jets with large transverse energy , or the vector meson and photon production at very high transverse momenta  @xcite .",
    "the initial studies presented in this paper indicate that the installation at about 240  m from the ip of the recently proposed detectors might permit , at relatively low cost and effort , to utilize the lhc as a high - energy -collider .",
    "the significant luminosity of the tagged photon - photon collisions open in particular an exciting possibility of studying the exclusive production of the higgs boson , and for searches of new phenomena in high - energy  collisions .",
