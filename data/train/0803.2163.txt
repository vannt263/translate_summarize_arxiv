    "the thomas  fermi ( tf ) equation has proved useful for the treatment of many physical phenomena that include atoms@xcite , molecules@xcite , atoms in strong magnetic fields@xcite , crystals@xcite and dense plasmas@xcite among others .",
    "for that reason there has been great interest in the accurate solution of that equation , and , in particular , in the accurate calculation of the slope at origin@xcite . besides",
    ", the mathematical aspects of the tf equation have been studied in detail@xcite .",
    "some time ago liao@xcite proposed the application of a technique called homotopy analysis method ( ham ) to the solution of the tf equation and stated that `` it is the first time such an elegant and explicit analytic solution of the thomas  fermi equation is given '' .",
    "this claim is surprising because at first sight earlier analytical approaches are apparently simpler and seem to have produced much more accurate results@xcite .",
    "recently , khan and xu@xcite improved liao s ham by the addition of adjustable parameters that improve the convergence of the perturbation series .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to compare the improved ham with a straightforward analytical procedure based on pad approximants@xcite supplemented with a method developed some time ago@xcite . in section [ sec : ham ]",
    "we outline the main ideas of the ham , in section [ sec : hpm ] apply the hankel  pad method ( hpm ) to the tf equation , and in section [ sec : conclusions ] we compare the ham with the hpm and with other approaches .",
    "in order to facilitate later discussion we outline the main ideas behind the application of the ham to the tf equation .",
    "the tf equation @xmath0 is an example of two  point nonlinear boundary  value problem . when solving this ordinary differential equation one faces problem of the accurate calculation of the slope at origin @xmath1 that is consistent with the physical boundary conditions indicated in equation ( [ eq : tf ] ) .    in what follows",
    "we choose the notation of khan and xu@xcite whose approach is more general than the one proposed earlier by liao@xcite .",
    "they define the new solution @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and rewrite the tf equation as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the inverse of the slope at origin ( @xmath6 ) and @xmath7 is an adjustable parameter .",
    "khan and xu@xcite state that the solution to eq .",
    "( [ eq : tf2 ] ) can be written in the form @xmath8 that reduces to liao s expansion@xcite when @xmath9 .    in principle",
    "there is no reason to assume that the series ( [ eq : g_series ] ) converges and no proof is given in that sense@xcite . besides , the partial sums of the series ( [ eq : g_series ] ) will not give the correct asymptotic behaviour at infinity@xcite as other expansions do@xcite .",
    "liao@xcite and kahn and xu@xcite do not use the ansatz ( [ eq : g_series ] ) directly to solve the problem but resort to perturbation theory .",
    "for example ,",
    "kahn and xu@xcite base their approach on the modified equation @xmath10 = q\\hbar \\mathcal{n}% \\left [ \\phi ( \\xi ; q),\\gamma ( q)\\right ]   \\label{eq : ham}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are linear and nonlinear operators , respectively , @xmath13 is a perturbation parameter and @xmath14 is another adjustable parameter . besides , @xmath15 is a conveniently chosen initial function and @xmath16 becomes the solution to equation ( [ eq : tf2 ] ) when @xmath17@xcite .",
    "both @xmath16 and @xmath18 are expanded in a taylor series about @xmath19 as in standard perturbation theory , and @xmath20 is another adjustable parameter@xcite .",
    "the authors state that ham is a very flexible approach that enables one to choose the linear operator and the initial solution freely@xcite and also to introduce several adjustable parameters@xcite .",
    "however , one is surprised that with so many adjustable parameters the results are far from impressive , even at remarkable great perturbation orders@xcite .",
    "for example the @xmath21 $ ] pad approximant of the ham series yields @xmath22 with three exact digits@xcite , while the @xmath23 $ ] pad approximant of the @xmath24 expansion@xcite provides slightly better results@xcite . a more convenient expansion of the solution of the tf equation leads to many more accurate digits@xcite with less terms .",
    "in what follows we outline a simple , straightforward analytical method for the accurate calculation of @xmath1 . in order to facilitate the application of the hpm we define the variables @xmath25 and @xmath26 ,",
    "so that the tf equation becomes @xmath27 -f(t)f^{\\prime } ( t)-2t^{2}f(t)^{3}=0   \\label{eq : tf3}\\ ] ] we expand the solution @xmath28 to this differential equation in a taylor series about @xmath29 : @xmath30 where the coefficients @xmath31 depend on @xmath32 . on substitution of the series ( [ eq : f_series ] ) into equation ( [ eq : tf3 ] ) we easily calculate as many coefficients @xmath31 as desired ; for example , the first of them are @xmath33    the hpm is based on the transformation of the power series ( [ eq : f_series ] ) into a rational function or pad approximant @xmath34(t)=\\frac{\\sum_{j=0}^{m}a_{j}t^{j}}{\\sum_{j=0}^{n}b_{j}t^{j } } \\label{eq:[m / n]}\\ ] ] one would expect that @xmath35 in order to have the correct limit at infinity ; however , in order to obtain an accurate value of @xmath36 it is more convenient to choose @xmath37 , @xmath38 as in previous applications of the approach to the schrdinger equation ( in this case it was called riccati  pad method ( rpm))@xcite .",
    "the rational function ( [ eq:[m / n ] ] ) has @xmath39 coefficients that we may choose so that @xmath40,t)=\\mathcal{o}(t^{2n+d+1})$ ] and the coefficient @xmath41 remains undetermined .",
    "if we require that @xmath40,t)=\\mathcal{o}% ( t^{2n+d+2})$ ] we have another equation from which we obtain @xmath36 . however , it is convenient to proceed in a different ( and entirely equivalent ) way and require that @xmath34(t)-\\sum_{j=0}^{2n+d+1}f_{j}t^{j}=\\mathcal{o}(t^{2n+d+2 } ) \\label{eq:[m / n]2}\\ ] ] in order to satisfy this condition it is necessary that the hankel determinant vanishes @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the dimension of the hankel matrix .",
    "each hankel determinant is a polynomial function of @xmath36 and we expect that there is a sequence of roots @xmath44}$ ] , @xmath45 that converges towards the actual value of @xmath46 for a given value of @xmath47 .",
    "we compare sequences with different values of @xmath47 for inner consistency ( all of them should give the same limit ) .",
    "notice that a somewhat similar idea was also proposed by tu@xcite , although he did not develop it consistently .",
    "present approach is simple and straightforward : we just obtain the taylor coefficients @xmath31 from the differential equation ( [ eq : tf3 ] ) in terms of @xmath36 , derive the hankel determinant , and calculate its roots . since @xmath48 is the first nonzero coefficient that depends on @xmath36 we choose hankel sequences with @xmath49 .",
    "the hankel determinant @xmath50 exhibits many roots and their number increases with @xmath51 .",
    "if we compare the roots of @xmath50 with those of @xmath52 we easily identify the sequence @xmath44}$ ] that converges towards the actual value of @xmath36 .",
    "[ fig : logconv ] shows @xmath53}-2f_{2}^{[d-1,d]}\\right| $ ] for @xmath54 that provides a reasonable indication of the convergence of the sequence of roots .",
    "we clearly appreciate the great convergence rate of the sequences with @xmath55 and @xmath56 . for example , for @xmath55 and @xmath57 it is approximately given by @xmath58}-2f_{2}^{[d-1,3]}\\right|=14.2\\times 10^ { -0.705d}$ ] . from the sequences for @xmath57 we estimate @xmath59 which we believe is accurate to the last digit .",
    "we are not aware of a result of such accuracy in the literature with which we can compare our estimate .",
    "it is certainly far more accurate than the result obtained by kobayashi et al@xcite by numerical integration that is commonly chosen as a benchmark@xcite .",
    "present rational approximation to the tf function is completely different from previous application of the pad approximants , where the slope at origin was determined by the asymptotic behaviour of at infinity@xcite .",
    "our approach applies to @xmath60 and the slope at origin is determined by a local condition at that point ( [ eq:[m / n]2 ] ) which results in the hankel determinant ( [ eq : hankel ] ) . in this sense",
    "our approach is similar to ( although more systematic and consistent than ) tu s one@xcite as mentioned above .",
    "once we have the slope at origin we easily obtain an analytical expression for @xmath61 in terms of the rational approximation ( [ eq:[m / n ] ] ) to @xmath28 . in order to have the correct behaviour at infinity we choose @xmath62@xcite .",
    "table  [ tab : u(x ) ] shows values of @xmath61 and its first derivative for @xmath63 ( the approximation is obviously much better for @xmath64 ) given by the approximant @xmath65 $ ] .",
    "our results are in remarkably agreement with the numerical calculation of kobayashi et al@xcite and are by far much more accurate than those provided by the ham@xcite .",
    "notice that we are comparing a @xmath65 $ ] pad approximant on the straightforward series expansion ( [ eq : f_series ] ) with @xmath66 $ ] and @xmath67 $ ] approximants on an elaborated perturbation series@xcite .",
    "any accurate analytical expression of the solution @xmath61 to the tf equation requires an accurate value of the unknown slope at origin @xmath1 , and the hpm provides it in a simple and straightforward way . in this sense",
    "the hpm appears to be preferable to other accurate approaches@xcite and is far superior to the ham@xcite .",
    "notice for example that our estimate @xmath68}=-1.588 $ ] , based on a rational approximation @xmath69 $ ] , is better than the result provided by a @xmath21 $ ] pad approximant on the improved ham perturbation series@xcite . besides , by comparing table 2 of khan and xu@xcite with our fig .",
    "[ fig : logconv ] one realizes the different convergence rate of both approaches .",
    "one should also take into account that the hpm does not have any adjustable parameter for tuning up its convergence properties , while , on the other hand , the `` flexible '' ham with some such parameters plus a pad summation results in a much smaller convergence rate@xcite .    we also constructed a pad approximant",
    "@xmath65 $ ] from the series ( [ eq : f_series ] ) and obtained the tf function and its derivative with an accuracy that outperforms the @xmath66 $ ] and @xmath21 $ ] pad approximants on the ham perturbation series@xcite .",
    "it is clear that the hpm is by far simpler , more straightforward , and much more accurate than the ham .",
    "in addition to the physical utility of the hpm we think that its mathematical features are most interesting .",
    "although we can not provide a rigorous proof of the existence of a convergent sequence of roots for each nonlinear problem , or that the sequences will converge towards the correct physical value of the unknown , a great number of successful applications to the schrdinger equation@xcite suggest that the hpm is worth further investigation .",
    "notice that we obtain a global property of the tf equation @xmath1 from a local approach : the series expansion about the origin ( [ eq : f_series ] ) .",
    "the fact that our original rational approximation ( [ eq:[m / n ] ] ) does not have the correct behaviour at infinity is not at all a problem because we may resort to a more conventient expansion@xcite once we have an accurate value of the unknown slope at origin .",
