    "in this note , we consider two different presentations for the group @xmath1 , whose cayley graphs exhibit quite different geometry . first we consider the standard presentation @xmath5 note that this is a right angled artin group with the standard presentation , so by theorem 3.1 in @xcite , the pair @xmath6 satisfies the falsification by fellow traveller property . the other presentation that we will consider is @xmath7",
    "these presentations can be seen to define the same group by the tietze transformations below : @xmath8 our main theorem is that the pair @xmath9 is not minimally almost convex . as a corollary ,",
    "the following properties all depend on the generating set :    * the falsification by fellow traveler property * the basepoint loop shortening property * every non - trivial almost convexity condition .",
    "this includes almost convexity , poenaru s condition @xmath4 , minimal almost convexity ( mac ) and the slightly stronger condition m@xmath10ac .    in the final section",
    "we show that @xmath9 does not satisfy the loop shortening property , so this property also depends on the generating set .",
    "there are many known examples of groups which satisfy fftp with respect to one generating set but not others .",
    "for example , neumann and shapiro gave an example in @xcite when they introduced the property , and elder gave another example in @xcite .",
    "the only previous example for almost convexity was given by theil @xcite .",
    "elder and hermiller used solvable baumslag - solitar groups to show that minimal almost convexity is not a quasi - isometry invariant , nor is m@xmath10ac @xcite , so it is not surprising that these both depend on the generating set .",
    "it was previously unknown , however , whether poenaru s condition p(2 ) or either of the loop shortening properties were dependent on the generating set .",
    "in the following definition , let @xmath11 denote the sphere of radius @xmath12 around the identity in the cayley graph , and let @xmath13 denote the ball of radius @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath14 be a group and let @xmath15 be a finite generating set for @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath16 and let @xmath17 be a function .",
    "the pair @xmath18 is said to satisfy the almost convexity condition @xmath19 if the following holds : if @xmath20 and @xmath21 satisfy @xmath22 , then there is some path @xmath23 between @xmath24 and @xmath25 such that @xmath23 is contained in @xmath13 and @xmath23 has length at most @xmath26 .    using this definition ,",
    "almost convexity ( ac ) imposes the strongest possible restriction on @xmath27 , namely that @xmath27 is a constant function .",
    "this property was introduced by cannon in @xcite , and remains the most widely used almost convexity condition .",
    "a pair @xmath18 is said to satisfy poenaru s condition @xmath4 @xcite if it satisfies an almost convexity condition @xmath19 for some sub - linear function @xmath27 .",
    "note that the points @xmath24 and @xmath25 in the definition above are joined via the origin by a path of length @xmath28 , so every finitely generated group trivially satisfies any almost convexity condition where @xmath29 . hence , minimal almost convexity ( mac ) requires the weakest possible non - trivial almost convexity condition : that @xmath30 .",
    "the slightly stronger condition m@xmath10ac requires that @xmath31 . due to the successive strengthening of these conditions",
    ", we have the implication chain @xmath32    the last two conditions m@xmath10ac and mac are discussed in greater detail in @xcite , where elder and hermiller show that m@xmath10ac does not imply @xmath4 .",
    "it is still an open question , however , whether the properties m@xmath10ac and mac are equivalent .",
    "the main theorem in this section is that the group @xmath9 with presentation @xmath33 does not satisfy mac .    consider the group @xmath34 and let @xmath35 be the subgroup generated by @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "then @xmath14 is the hnn extension @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the identity .",
    "@xmath35 is the subgroup of @xmath14 consisting of all elements @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is a word in @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the sum of the exponents in @xmath41 .",
    "let @xmath41 be a word in @xmath42 and let @xmath43 be the sum of the exponents in @xmath41 .",
    "we will show that @xmath44 .",
    "let @xmath45 , where each @xmath46 and each @xmath47 . then @xmath48    now let @xmath49 .",
    "we will show that @xmath50 for some word @xmath51 , where @xmath43 is the sum of the exponents in @xmath41 . since @xmath52 , we can write @xmath53 where each @xmath46 and each @xmath47",
    ". then we have @xmath54 where @xmath45 and @xmath43 is the sum of the exponents in @xmath41",
    ".    the pair @xmath55 does not satisfy mac .",
    "consider the elements @xmath56 and @xmath57 in @xmath14 .",
    "then @xmath58 and @xmath59 so we just need to prove that if @xmath23 is a path in @xmath60 between @xmath56 and @xmath57 , then @xmath23 has length at least @xmath61 .    .",
    "the bold vertices and edges are those within the ball of radius 10.,width=537 ]    let @xmath23 be a path in @xmath60 between @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "then let @xmath62 and @xmath63 be adjacent vertices in @xmath23 , such that @xmath62 is in the same sheet of the hnn extension as @xmath64 and @xmath63 is in the same sheet as @xmath65",
    ". then @xmath49",
    ". moreover , since @xmath23 is contained in @xmath60 , the length @xmath66 , so @xmath67 .",
    "let @xmath50 where @xmath41 is a word in @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the sum of the exponents in @xmath41 .",
    "then @xmath68    let @xmath69 be maximal such that the word @xmath41 splits as @xmath70 .",
    "in other words , @xmath71 is the number of @xmath72 s at the start of @xmath41 .",
    "then the sum of the exponents in @xmath73 is @xmath74 , so @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , @xmath76 so @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , @xmath78 is freely reduced , so @xmath79 therefore , @xmath80 hence , the path @xmath23 satisfies @xmath81 as required .",
    "so @xmath9 does not satisfy mac .",
    "in @xcite elder introduced the loop shortening and basepoint loop shortening properties as a natural generalisation of the falsification by fellow traveller property . where fftp gives a simple way to check if a word is a geodesic , each of the loop shortening properties gives a somewhat simple way to check if a word represents the identity in the group .",
    "let @xmath14 be a group with finite generating set @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath18 has the ( synchronous ) loop shortening property ( lsp ) if there is a constant @xmath43 such that for any loop @xmath82 in @xmath83 with @xmath84 , there is a shorter loop @xmath85 such that @xmath86 for each @xmath87 , and @xmath88 for @xmath89 . in other words , the paths ( synchronously ) @xmath43-fellow travel .",
    "let @xmath14 be a group with finite generating set @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath18 has the ( synchronous ) basepoint loop shortening property ( blsp ) if there is a constant @xmath43 such that for any loop @xmath82 in @xmath83 with @xmath90 , there is a shorter loop @xmath91 such that @xmath86 for each @xmath87 , and @xmath88 for @xmath89 . in other words , the paths ( synchronously ) @xmath43-fellow travel .",
    "note that the only difference between these two properties is that for the basepoint loop shortening property , the initial loop is around a basepoint which the shorter loop has to pass through , whereas for the loop shortening property no such restriction is imposed .",
    "hence , it is clear that @xmath92 elder also showed that the basepoint loop shortening property is strictly stronger than almost convexity and strictly weaker than the falsification by fellow traveller property ( fftp ) , so we have the long implication chain @xmath93    elder asked two questions about the two loop shortening properties .",
    "the first is whether they are equivalent , and this remains an open problem .",
    "the second is whether either or both of these properties depend on the generating set . we have already shown that the group @xmath94 satisfies fftp with respect to one generating set , but fails mac with another , which implies that blsp depends on the generating set .",
    "our final theorem settles the other half of this question , namely that the loop shortening property also depends on the generating set .",
    "let @xmath95 .",
    "we will show that there is a loop @xmath96 in @xmath97 such that there is no shorter loop @xmath98 in @xmath97 which @xmath43-fellow travels with @xmath96 .",
    "hence this will show that @xmath97 does not satisfy the loop shortening property .",
    "let @xmath96 be the loop given by the word @xmath99 we can easily check algebraically that @xmath100 , so this is indeed a loop .",
    "now let @xmath98 be a loop which @xmath43-fellow travels with @xmath96 .",
    "then we just need to show that the length of @xmath98 is at least the length of @xmath96 , which is @xmath101 .",
    "since the four vertices @xmath102 appear in @xmath96 in that order , there must be vertices @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 appearing in @xmath98 in that order which satisfy @xmath107 for each @xmath108 .",
    "hence it suffices to prove that @xmath109 for each @xmath110 , let @xmath111 be a word of minimal length from @xmath112 to @xmath113 .",
    "so @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "for each @xmath108 , let @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 be the sums of the powers of @xmath72 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 , respectively in the word @xmath111 .",
    "then we will show the following four inequalities , from which the desired result follows : @xmath121 @xmath122 @xmath123 @xmath124      let @xmath41 be a word of minimal length from @xmath103 to @xmath104 .",
    "so @xmath125 consider the quotient map @xmath126 defined by @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "note that this is well defined since @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 . since @xmath120 commutes with @xmath72 and @xmath119 , we can write @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is a reduced word over the alphabet @xmath137",
    ". then @xmath138 and @xmath139 are the sums of the powers of @xmath72 and @xmath119 , respectively , in @xmath136 and @xmath140 similarly we can write @xmath141 .",
    "now , @xmath142 since @xmath136 and @xmath143 each have length at most @xmath43 , they can only cancel with letters in @xmath144 on either side of the last expression , and not the @xmath145 term in the middle .",
    "in other words , if @xmath146 is a reduced word for @xmath147 and @xmath148 is a reduced word for @xmath149 , then @xmath150 is a reduced word for @xmath151 .",
    "moreover , the sums of the powers of @xmath72 in @xmath146 and @xmath148 are @xmath152 and @xmath153 respectively , and the sums of the powers of @xmath119 in @xmath146 and @xmath148 are @xmath154 and @xmath155 respectively . hence , @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "therefore , @xmath158      now let @xmath12 be a word of minimal length between @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "then @xmath160 forms a path @xmath23 from @xmath161 to @xmath162 .",
    "since @xmath161 is in the sheet of the hnn extension containing 1 and @xmath162 is in the sheet containing @xmath65 , there must be vertices @xmath163 and @xmath164 which are adjacent in @xmath23 and such that @xmath163 is in the sheet containing 1 and @xmath164 is in the sheet containig @xmath65 .",
    "so @xmath165 and @xmath166 , the subgroup generated by @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "let @xmath167 be the one generator cyclic group , and let @xmath168 be the group homomorphism defined by @xmath169 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "then @xmath35 is in the kernel of @xmath62 , so @xmath172 . since @xmath173 , the distances @xmath174 and @xmath175 are both at least @xmath43 .",
    "but the sections of @xmath23 joining @xmath161 and @xmath104 and @xmath105 to @xmath162 both have length at most @xmath43 .",
    "hence @xmath163 and @xmath164 lie on the section of @xmath23 between @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "hence , the distance @xmath176 now @xmath177 .",
    "therefore , @xmath178 similarly , @xmath179 putting these together gives @xmath180 in exactly the same way , we deduce the final inequality , @xmath124 so we now have lower bounds for all four of the distances @xmath181 .",
    "therefore , the length of the loop @xmath98 is at least @xmath182 which is the same as the length of @xmath96 .",
    "hence the pair @xmath9 does not enjoy the loop shortening property ."
