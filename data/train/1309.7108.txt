    "in this paper , we present a robust a priori analysis of first order least squares method with weakly imposed boundary condition for the following convection dominated diffusion equation    [ cd_eqs ] @xmath2    where @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) is a polyhedral domain , @xmath5 , @xmath6 a function in @xmath7 , @xmath8 a function in @xmath9 and @xmath10 a function in @xmath11 . here , the variable flux @xmath12 satisfies the following assumption :    [ as_beta ] @xmath13    according to @xcite , the assumption ( [ as1 ] ) is satisfied if @xmath14 least squares methods have been frequently used to simulate solutions of partial differential equations arising from fluid dynamics and continuum mechanics .",
    "we refer to @xcite for comprehensive summary .",
    "it is well known that least squares methods have the following desirable features : it leads to a minimization problem ; its numerical stability is _ not _ sensitive to the choice of finite element space or meshes ; the resulting global stiffness matrices are symmetric and positive definite ; a practical a posteriori error estimator can be given without any additional cost , and so on ( see @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , primitive least squares methods for convection dominated diffusion problems ( [ cd_eqs ] ) have the following drawbacks .",
    "firstly , if the term @xmath15 is _ not _ uniformly bounded from below by a positive constant , @xmath0 a priori error estimate of primitive least squares methods will deteriorate as the diffusion coefficient @xmath16 goes to zero , even when the exact solution has no interior layers or boundary layers ( see error estimates in @xcite ) . secondly",
    ", primitive least squares methods show a very poor performance for convection diffusion problem ( [ cd_eqs ] ) with a sufficiently small diffusion coefficient , because large spurious oscillations are observed ( see numerical experiments in @xcite ) .",
    "we notice that in @xcite , residual - free bubble strategy is used to address the second drawback .",
    "but , the least squares method in @xcite needs to compute basis functions element - wisely , which is relatively not easy to implement .",
    "it is well known that streamline diffusion method @xcite , residual free bubble methods @xcite , and dg methods @xcite do not suffer from the above two drawbacks of primitive least squares methods .",
    "we refer to @xcite as comprehensive summaries of numerical methods suitable for convection dominated diffusion problems .",
    "we would like to emphasize that none of these numerical methods ( streamline diffusion method , residual free bubble methods , dg methods ) results in symmetric global stiffness matrices .",
    "hence from the point of view of solver design , the least squares method is more attractive than the other methods mentioned before and many works have been contributed to this subject ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , we derive that the condition number of linear system from our first order least squares method is at most @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the mesh size . in particular , the condition number is independent of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "this property is important for designing efficient solver , e.g. , multilevel method , for the first order least squares approximation of convection dominated diffusion equation .    in this paper , we propose and analyze our first order least squares method to address these two drawbacks for primitive least squares methods .",
    "in fact , it is difficult to provide robust @xmath0 error estimate by the traditional approach of numerical analysis for least squares methods in @xcite .",
    "so , it is necessary to look for an alternative approach .",
    "we notice that a weighted test function was used in @xcite to obtain the @xmath0 stability of the original dg method @xcite for the transportation reaction equation , and this idea was generalized to convection - diffusion - reaction equation in @xcite using the ip ",
    "dg methods . in this paper",
    ", we rewrite our method in the framework of discontinuous petrov-galerkin ( dpg ) method , then show numerical stability by using a key equation discovered in @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this new approach is that the weight function in @xcite is shown to stay in some  equivalent \" test function space ( see ( [ abstract_key_equation ] ) in section  [ sec : abstract ] ) such that numerical stability can be obtained without using any projection as in @xcite .",
    "this approach is novel and useful to numerical analysis of least squares methods for a large class of differential equations .",
    "this new approach of numerical analysis is also different from traditional ones used for dpg method in @xcite .",
    "we show that , roughly speaking , using polynomials of degree @xmath19 , @xmath20 if @xmath21 for any @xmath22 , @xmath23 here , the constant @xmath24 is independent of @xmath16 .",
    "thus , we can conclude that a priori error estimate in ( [ main_result_introduction ] ) is _ robust _ with respect to the diffusion coefficient @xmath16 , which addresses the first draw back .",
    "we also want to emphasize that the convergence result ( [ main_result_introduction ] ) shows our method has @xmath0 convergence rate even if @xmath1 , which means our method does not have excessive smoothness requirements than other methods . in order to overcome the second drawback , we impose dirichlet boundary condition in an weak way , such that the error along the boundary layers will not propagate into the whole domain .",
    "we show the advantage of imposing boundary condition weakly by numerical experiments .",
    "we notice that our way of imposing boundary condition is similar to the weak imposition of dirichlet boundary condition in @xcite , which belongs to nitsche s method in @xcite . however , we do _ not _ have to choose any penalty terms empirically while @xcite needs .",
    "we would like to emphasize that weakly imposing boundary condition is essential to least squares methods while it is incrementally helpful to streamline diffusion method and dg methods ( see numerical experiments in @xcite ) .",
    "if boundary condition is imposed strongly , the numerical solutions produced by streamline diffusion method and dg methods may have artificial oscillation along boundary layers , while the accuracy in subdomains away from boundary layers is still remarkable . however , according to our numerical experiments , if we impose boundary condition strongly , then numerical solution of least squares methods will be polluted on almost the whole domain by boundary layers .",
    "we have tried to add several stabilization terms , which have been utilized by streamline diffusion method or dg methods , into least squares methods to prevent propagation of error from boundary layers .",
    "none of them works except weakly imposing boundary condition .",
    "this paper is the first one which addresses the two drawbacks of least squares methods for convection dominated diffusion problems .",
    "now , we would like to compare with dpg methods , which can be considered as a special class of least squares methods .",
    "we notice that all dpg methods @xcite need to compute optimal test function space . on each element such that the implementation is more complicated than ours ( methods in @xcite are similar to dpg methods . )",
    "next , we would like to compare our results with ip ",
    "dg method @xcite .",
    "@xcite is the first paper which gives _ robust _ a priori error estimate for variable flux @xmath12 .",
    "however , ip ",
    "dg method @xcite has to choose stabilization parameter empirically while our method does not .",
    "in addition , ip ",
    "dg method @xcite can have _ robust _",
    "@xmath0 convergence only when the mesh size @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a positive constant depending on @xmath12 ( see theorem @xmath27 in @xcite ) .",
    "on the contrast , the convergence result of our method does not have this restriction .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section @xmath28 , we introduce our first order least squares method and the main theoretical results . in section @xmath29 ,",
    "we show a novel approach to do numerical analysis for least squares methods ( _ not _ restricted to our first order least squares method for convection dominated diffusion problems ) . in section @xmath30",

    ", we give numerical experiments which verify our theoretical results . in section @xmath33 , we extend our first order least squares method for transportation reaction problems .",
    "in this section , we present setting of meshes , first order least squares method and the main theoretical results .",
    "let @xmath34 be a conforming triangulation of the domain @xmath35 made of shape - regular simplexes @xmath36 .",
    "for each element @xmath37 , we set @xmath38 and for each of its faces @xmath39 , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 denotes the lebesgue measure in @xmath42 or @xmath43 dimensions .",
    "we associate to @xmath44 the set of faces @xmath45 as well as those of interior faces @xmath46 and boundary faces @xmath47 .",
    "we say that @xmath48 if there are two elements @xmath49 and @xmath50 in @xmath44 such that @xmath51 , and we say that @xmath52 if there is an element @xmath36 in @xmath44 such that @xmath53 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath54 .",
    "we define @xmath55",
    ". we can rewrite ( [ cd_eqs ] ) as the following first - order equations :    @xmath56    we define the finite element space @xmath57 , where    [ fem_space ] @xmath58    here , @xmath59 is the space of polynomials on the domain @xmath60 of total degree at most @xmath61 , a non - negative integer . obviously , there is a positive constant @xmath24 ,    [ fem_space_assumps ] @xmath62    the first order least squares method is to find @xmath63 satisfying @xmath64 in ( [ ls_formulation ] ) , the inner products are defined in the following natural manner : @xmath65 with the obvious modifications for vector - valued functions .",
    "notice that the boundary condition imposed on outflow boundary ( @xmath66 ) is @xmath67 .",
    "this is the reason we say _ dirichlet boundary condition is weakly imposed_. if we ignore the weight function used in @xcite , the first order least squares method in @xcite is to find @xmath68 satisfying @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the main difference between ( [ ls_formulation ] ) and ( [ ls_formulation_strong ] ) is that in ( [ ls_formulation_strong ] ) , dirichlet boundary condition is imposed strongly while our method ( [ ls_formulation ] ) uses weakly imposed boundary condition .",
    "our convergence analysis in section  [ sec : convergence ] is also valid for least squares method ( [ ls_formulation_strong ] ) .",
    "but , if the solution of ( [ cd_eqs ] ) has boundary layers or interior layers , then our way of weakly imposing boundary condition in ( [ ls_formulation ] ) can improve the accuracy of numerical solution in subdomains away from layers dramatically .",
    "we refer to section @xmath31 for detailed description .    in ( [ ls_formulation ] )",
    ", we weakly imposed the dirichlet boundary condition by @xmath72 in fact , we can also weakly imposed the dirichlet boundary condition as @xmath73 then , the first order least squares method is to find @xmath63 satisfying @xmath74 we can still obtain the stability estimate similar to lemma  [ lemma_numerical_stability ] . however , the @xmath0 convergence rate of ( [ ls_formulation_alt ] ) is the same as that of ( [ ls_formulation ] ) , since the approximation to @xmath75 in @xmath0-norm gets involved with the error analysis ( see the proof of theorem  [ mainth1 ] ) .",
    "we state our main theoretical results on a priori error analysis and condition number estimation of the first order least squares method as the following theorems .",
    "we denote by @xmath24 a positive constant , which is independent of @xmath16 and @xmath18 .",

    "if we assume the meshes are quasi - uniform , then @xmath84    in theorem  [ mainth2 ] , we obtain optimal convergence of @xmath85 if @xmath80 for any @xmath22 .",
    "the restriction on mesh size is due to the energy norm of @xmath86 in lemma  [ lemma_numerical_stability ] is @xmath87 thus , we need to utilize inverse inequality and the above restriction on mesh size to obtain upper bound on @xmath88 .",
    "in this section , an alternative approach is introduced for numerical analysis of least squares methods in general ( _ not _ restricted to the first order least squares method ( [ ls_formulation ] ) ) .",
    "first of all , we show least squares methods and dpg method in abstract settings , respectively",
    ". then , we rewrite least squares methods in the framework of dpg method . a key equation in @xcite",
