    "the advent of wide - field imaging cameras on 4-meter class telescopes in the last decade has led to a number of large homogeneous surveys of the galactic open star cluster population .",
    "these studies not only shed light on cluster properties ( e.g. , distances , stellar content , ages , and metallicities ) and their formation mechanisms , they also directly help in our understanding of the evolution and chemical structure of the galactic disk .",
    "for example , the wiyn open cluster survey @xcite and the cfht open cluster survey @xcite have now targeted several dozens of these systems in our galaxy ( e.g. , ngc  6819  kalirai et  al .",
    "2001b ; ngc  2099  kalirai et  al .  2001c",
    "; ngc  2168 and ngc  2323  von hippel et  al .",

    "ngc  6791 is a relatively nearby star cluster ( @xmath8 4 kpc ",
    "chaboyer , green , & liebert 1999 ) located at ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) = ( 69.96@xmath11 , 10.90@xmath11 ) .",
    "very early studies of the system established it as one of the most populous open star clusters , with a mass of several thousand solar masses ( e.g. , kinman 1965 ) .",
    "these first studies also concluded that ngc  6791 s stellar content is both very old and has a high metal abundance ( e.g. , spinrad & taylor 1971 ) .",
    "more recent studies have confirmed these earlier results with greater precision ; current best estimates indicate that the age of ngc  6791 is @xmath78  gyr , the [ @xmath12/fe ] is solar @xcite , and the metallicity is [ fe / h ] = @xmath10.3 ",
    "@xmath10.5 @xcite .",
    "the cluster therefore ranks as both one of the oldest open clusters and one of the most metal - rich in our galaxy @xcite .",
    "given this unique combination , ngc  6791 currently serves as _ the _ high metallicity anchor when measuring star formation histories from cmds of nearby galaxies .",
    "the cmd of ngc  6791 exhibits some peculiar features ( e.g. , stetson et  al .",
    "the cluster contains a large blue straggler population , and both a red giant clump and an extremely blue horizontal branch .",
    "given the high metallicity , this is a strong example of the second parameter effect .",
    "the extreme horizontal branch has very likely formed as a result of increased mass loss in post main - sequence evolutionary phases , possibly due to the high metallicity of the cluster @xcite .",
    "although the presence of these stars in the field has been suggested to possibly arise from binary evolution ( e.g. , allard et  al .",
    "1994 ; maxted et  al .  2001 ; han et  al .",
    "2003 ) , this does not appear to be the case in star clusters ( e.g. , moni  bidin et  al .",
    "2006a ) , especially a system like ngc  6791 ( see discussion in ",
    "[ ehbstars ] ) .",
    "the cluster orbit is highly eccentric , which combined with its chemical content and position , has led to suggestions that it may even represent the nucleus of a tidally disrupted galaxy @xcite .",
    "the unique properties of ngc  6791 certainly hold promising information on its origins and past dynamical and stellar evolutionary history .",
    "recently , @xcite produced the deepest cmd for ngc  6791 to date . using the hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) advanced camera for surveys",
    ", they observed the cluster for 4 orbits , reaching a limiting magnitude of @xmath13 = 28 .",
    "the resulting cmd shows a tightly constrained main - sequence to the limit of the data and , for the first time , has uncovered a large population of hundreds of white dwarfs in the cluster @xcite .",
    "these stellar remnants are cooling with age , becoming fainter as time passes , and therefore serve as _ clocks _ from which the cluster can be dated ( see e.g. , hansen et  al .",
    "2004 for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "this technique of determining ages of star clusters from white dwarf cooling theory successfully reproduces independently measured main - sequence turnoff ages in the six other open clusters , and two globular clusters , that have been tested to date @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite conclude that the white dwarf cooling age of ngc  6791 is in fact 2.4  gyr , a factor of three less than the well measured main - sequence turnoff age .",
    "such a discrepancy clearly adds to the list of peculiarities of this cluster .",
    "in this paper we present evidence that the white dwarf population of ngc  6791 is unlike that in other clusters .",
    "the formation of most of these stars has resulted from a unique evolutionary channel involving significant mass loss on the red giant branch , leading to a final mass below the critical mass needed to ignite helium in the core of the star @xcite .",
    "hence , the progenitors of these white dwarfs avoided the helium flash and therefore the cores of the white dwarfs are composed of helium and not carbon - oxygen . as a result ,",
    "the masses of the white dwarfs are well below the expected 0.5  0.6 @xmath6 value that the canonical channel produces for these initial masses . invoking helium core white dwarf models @xcite in the fit of the white dwarf cooling sequence from @xcite yields a consistent age for the cluster as measured from the turnoff .    in the next section ,",
    "we discuss our imaging data set for ngc  6791 .",
    "we present a new cmd of the cluster in  [ cmd ] , discuss its various features , and estimate an age for the cluster from the new data .",
    "next , we summarize the findings of @xcite and consider possible explanations in  [ bedinage ] .",
    "the first spectroscopic observations of ngc  6791 s white dwarf population are presented in  [ spectroscopicdata ] and  [ wdspectra ] and temperatures , gravities , and masses for these stars",
    "are derived in  [ wdmasses ] .",
    "the results and their implications are discussed in ",
    "[ discussion ] and the study is summarized in  [ conclusion ] .",
    "we imaged ngc  6791 with the cfh12k mosaic ccd on the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) in march and april of 2001 .",
    "this camera contains 12 ccds , each with 2048 @xmath14 4096 pixels , where each pixel subtends 0@xmath15206 .",
    "the detector projects to an area of 42@xmath16 @xmath14 28@xmath16 on the sky , much larger than the size of the cluster .",
    "the observations were taken in the @xmath17 and @xmath18 bands with the center of the cluster placed on one of the ccds ( away from the center of the mosaic where stars would be lost due to chip gaps ) .",
    "seven exposures were taken in each filter ( each one 850 seconds in @xmath18 and 1150 seconds in @xmath17 ) to achieve a photometric depth fainter than @xmath19 24 over a magnitude fainter than the brightest expected cluster white dwarfs .",
    "shallower exposures were also obtained to obtain photometry of the brighter stars that were saturated on the deeper exposures .",
    "most observations were obtained in sub - arcsecond seeing and all were taken under photometric skies .",
    "table  1 presents a complete observational log of the imaging data .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^ , > \" , ]     [ table2 ]    the derivation of masses of white dwarfs from modeling the hydrogen balmer lines has been shown to yield consistent results when compared to independent mass measurements , such as from gravitational redshifts @xcite .",
    "we determine the mass for each white dwarf by interpolating the @xmath20 and log  @xmath21 within the updated evolutionary models of @xcite .",
    "our standard model has a surface hydrogen layer mass fraction of @xmath22 = @xmath23 = 10@xmath24 and helium layer of @xmath25 = 10@xmath26 . for the uncertainties in the masses , we note that if these white dwarfs are the products of strong mass loss on the red giant branch , they may be less massive than typical field white dwarfs .",
    "surface gravities of less massive white dwarfs can be sensitive to the adopted hydrogen layer thickness , and so we have calculated a new suite of low - mass , helium core white dwarf models , using the models of @xcite , and considering a full range of @xmath22 up to very thick layers , @xmath22 = 10@xmath26 .",
    "therefore , we determine the _ range _ of acceptable masses by considering this full range of @xmath22 in addition to the errors on @xmath20 and log  @xmath21 .",
    "we find that the mean mass of the twelve white dwarfs in our sample is 0.44  @xmath6 .",
    "three of the stars have masses below 0.40 @xmath6 , five of the stars have masses of 0.40  0.47  @xmath6 , and only four objects have masses greater than 0.47  @xmath6 .",
    "the uncertainties on the individual mass measurements are typically 0.02  @xmath6 and at worst 0.05 @xmath6 for one star .",
    "these results clearly suggest that the white dwarf population of ngc  6791 is indeed notably undermassive when compared to both other star clusters and the field distribution ( see below ) . as we discussed earlier , this is likely linked to the evolution of the progenitors of these white dwarfs .",
    "we summarize the derived parameters for each white dwarf in table  2 .",
    "we noted above that the best fit model for wd  10 did not reproduce the h@xmath27 line well . as the mass for that star is 0.44  @xmath6 , ignoring it from the sample would not change the results .",
    "also included in table  2 is the cooling age of each star ( last column ) .",
    "the default values are those derived using the models described above for helium cores , except for wd  2 and wd  7 .",
    "these two stars both have @xmath3 @xmath28 0.50  @xmath6 and therefore we have used the standard 50/50 carbon - oxygen core models from @xcite to derive ages . for four other white dwarfs with @xmath3 @xmath29 0.50  @xmath6 , in addition to the ages derived from helium core models we have also indicated the ages assuming the carbon - oxygen models in brackets .",
    "the uncertainties on the cooling ages , especially for the low mass stars , are large as we have considered a full range in the mass of the h layer as discussed above .",
    "we noted earlier in  [ cmd ] that a blank field of equal area taken from the outer ccds shows a very low density of faint - blue stellar objects .",
    "the expected contamination from such field white dwarfs in our cmd is approximately three objects .",
    "this is @xmath020% of the number of stars targeted in our spectroscopic observations .",
    "the masses of the white dwarfs derived above support this .",
    "they are much lower than typical field white dwarfs and therefore these stars must belong to the cluster .",
    "for example , the mass distribution of the white dwarf sample in the palomar green ( pg ) survey @xcite peaks at a mass near 0.6  @xmath6 . for comparison to our ngc  6791 cluster white dwarfs , this sample of nearly 350 white dwarfs contains less than 25% stars with @xmath30 0.54  @xmath6 , 10% with @xmath30 0.47  @xmath6 , and 2.6% with @xmath30 0.40  @xmath6 .",
    "an independent estimate can be drawn from the much larger sloan digital sky survey , which now contains over 7000 white dwarfs in total @xcite .",
    "for those 2896 stars with @xmath31 @xmath32 19 ( the spectral quality of white dwarfs in this sample is poorer than in the pg sample ) , the sloan dataset contains 16% stars with @xmath30 0.54  @xmath6 , 6.3% with @xmath30 0.47  @xmath6 , and 3.3% with @xmath30 0.40  @xmath6 .    we can attempt to quantify which of our white dwarfs are field stars , if any . for this , we first calculate a theoretical color for each white dwarf using the @xcite models and our measured values of @xmath20 and log  @xmath21 . comparing this color directly to our",
    "@xmath33 photometry yields an estimate for the reddening of each star .",
    "this reddening , coupled with an estimate of the star s absolute magnitude ( similarly calculated from the models ) , yields the estimated distance modulus for each star . for almost every white dwarf",
    ", the error in this distance modulus is dominated by the uncertainty in the extinction given the typical @xmath70.1 color error .",
    "cluster membership can now be established by comparing these distance moduli and reddenings , for each star , to estimates for ngc 6791 .",
    "we find that nine of our twelve white dwarfs are consistent within the 2-@xmath34 range of cluster parameters .",
    "this suggests a 25% contamination fraction , slightly larger than our estimate based on the blank field earlier in  [ cmd ] .",
    "furthermore , all three objects that do not agree with the range of ngc  6791 s distance moduli and reddening are at the high mass end of our sample , wd  2 ( 0.54  @xmath6 ) , wd  3 ( 0.49  @xmath6 ) , and wd  5 ( 0.47  @xmath6 ) .",
    "this latter object was also shown earlier to perhaps be in a binary system .",
    "therefore , the mean mass of our sample of white dwarfs decreases to 0.43  @xmath6 if we exclude these three possible field white dwarfs . however , we note that two of the three excluded stars have a mass significantly less than the field distribution and therefore it is not definitive that they are non - members .",
    "the method used to estimate membership here is approximate and does not take into account all possible biases .",
    "for example , small uncertainties in the theoretical colors and magnitudes from the white dwarf models are ignored and there may even be increased intrinsic extinction around these white dwarfs due to the progenitor mass loss .",
    "the cmd of ngc  6791 ( figure  [ fig : cmd ] ) clearly shows both a red giant clump and an extremely blue horizontal branch as discussed earlier . in figure",
    "[ fig : cmdzoom ] we take a closer look at these two phases , as well as the white dwarf cooling sequence of the cluster . in the top - right and middle - right panels , we count a total of approximately a dozen stars that are in each of the red giant clump and extreme horizontal branch phases of evolution ( over our field area ) .",
    "the presence of both of these core helium burning phases likely suggests that the red giants have undergone stochastic mass loss .",
    "in fact , the extremely blue horizontal branch is a likely sign that a fraction of the stars in this cluster have lost an increased amount of mass relative to the `` normal '' evolution that creates the red giant clump .",
    "an alternate method of producing extreme horizontal branch stars involves binary evolution in which one star loses mass to a companion ( see e.g. , han et  al .",
    "however , searches for binary companions among globular cluster extreme horizontal branch stars have been unsuccessful @xcite .",
    "such a scenario is also not likely in ngc  6791 .",
    "@xcite examined the cmds of about a dozen mostly old open clusters and found that ngc  6791 contains the lowest binary fraction of the group , 14% .",
    "the mean fraction among the rest of the sample is 30% .",
    "qualitatively , a large binary fraction for ngc  6791 appears to be ruled out from our much deeper cmd as well .",
    "there is no evidence for an obvious equal mass binary sequence nor a very strong signature of extra scatter above the cluster main sequence relative to the cmds of other rich clusters such as ngc  6819 , ngc  2099 , ngc  2168 , and ngc  2323 .",
    "all of these other clusters have been shown to contain 20  30% binaries through synthetic cmd tests @xcite .",
    "if binary evolution is the cause of the extreme horizontal branch , then it is very unusual that these other clusters do not contain any stars in this phase .",
    "in fact , the only other open cluster that shows evidence for an extreme horizontal branch happens to be very similar to ngc  6791 in its fundamental properties .",
    "ngc  188 is both an old and metal - rich system and contains two of these hot stars @xcite .",
    "this strengthens the case for a metallicity - related origin of the extreme horizontal branch stars in these clusters .",
    "binarity also suggests that the extreme horizontal branch stars in ngc  6791 should be centrally concentrated and should contain a significant spread in luminosity , neither of which are observed @xcite .",
    "the derived luminosity range is in fact consistent with that expected from metal - rich , hot horizontal branch stars @xcite .",
    "direct photometric and spectroscopic probes to confirm the nature of the extreme horizontal branch stars in ngc  6791 and ngc  188 have largely been unsuccessful .",
    "@xcite obtained far ultraviolet images with the space telescope imaging spectrograph on _ hst _ to study the possible progenitors of the extreme horizontal branch stars , the bluest of the giant branch stars .",
    "if the binary formation theory is correct , then a large fraction of these giants should contain white dwarf companions which could potentially be seen in the ultraviolet .",
    "however , in a dozen targeted stars ( six in each cluster ) , none of the ngc  6791 giants and just two of the ngc  188 giants showed a far ultraviolet flux ( which may itself come from the chromosphere of the giant star ) . detailed abundance analysis of the coolest extreme horizontal branch star in ngc  6791 combined with its optical colors favors it having suffered from heavy line blanketing due to the high metallicity as opposed to a binary nature .",
    "although @xcite do find that two of the other ngc  6791 horizontal branch stars are spectroscopic binaries , these two systems are not extremely blue horizontal branch stars .",
    "taken together , this evidence suggests that the likely cause of the extreme horizontal branch in ngc  6791 is related to the high metallicity of the cluster and not binary evolution .",
    "high dispersion observations of the fainter extreme horizontal branch stars ( as obtained for the blue horizontal branch stars ) could provide the definitive answer .",
    "the spectroscopic mass measurement of ngc  6791 s white dwarf population indicates that in addition to a red giant clump and extreme horizontal branch , there is yet a third , even more radical , evolutionary channel for the stars of this cluster .",
    "table  2 indicates that two - thirds of the ngc  6791 _ member _ white dwarfs have masses below the threshold ( @xmath00.46  @xmath6 ) at which helium is ignited to produce a carbon - oxygen mixture in the core .",
    "this suggests that the progenitor red giants of these stars did not experience a helium flash and therefore bypassed both of the above phases and landed directly on the white dwarf cooling sequence ( with helium cores ) .",
    "such evolution is consistent with models of red giants that suffered extreme mass loss ( see section  [ theoryrgb ]  dcruz et  al .",
    "it is also worth noting that all 12 of the ngc 6791 white dwarfs are da spectral type .",
    "based on the field white dwarf ratio , we would statistically expect a few of these stars to be db ( helium atmosphere ) white dwarfs .",
    "a possible explanation for this may be related to the unique evolutionary paths of the progenitor stars which avoided the shell helium burning phase .",
    "the cumulative effect from the post main - sequence evolution of _ all _ stars in ngc  6791 is shown in the bottom - right panel of figure  [ fig : cmdzoom ] .",
    "the crosses mark all objects on the cmd and the filled ( open ) circles mark the confirmed ( possible field ) cluster white dwarfs .",
    "not surprisingly , the bright part of the white dwarf cooling sequence looks unlike that of other star clusters , showing much more scatter .",
    "for example , the sequences of the open clusters m67 @xcite and ngc  6819 @xcite , as well as the globular clusters m4 @xcite and ngc  6397 @xcite exhibit a tighter distribution of points in the faint - blue end of the cmd .",
    "several factors likely contribute to the scatter .",
    "first , we noted in   [ cmd ] & [ membership ] that up to three of the white dwarfs in our sample could potentially be field white dwarfs and therefore there may be a 20  30% contamination fraction among all objects ( crosses ) .",
    "second , the masses of the _ cluster _ white dwarfs , and therefore their core compositions , are different along the cooling sequence .",
    "the evolutionary timescales of these stars therefore vary and this would work to wash out a tight cooling sequence .",
    "however , if this were the only cause we should see a correlation between the white dwarf masses and their positions in the cmd .",
    "figure  [ fig : wdspectra ] shows that this is , in general , not the case .",
    "although it can not be a large effect for the reasons outlined above , some binary evolution may be present in our white dwarf sample .",
    "the spectra of both wd  5 and wd  10 show evidence of contamination , possibly from faint companions .",
    "any mass transfer in the evolution of these systems would certainly alter the subsequent evolution on the white dwarf cooling sequence ( see e.g. , hurley & shara 2003 ) .",
    "although statistically unlikely , it is also possible that we have targeted a double degenerate system .",
    "finally , we have plotted both a @xmath18 and @xmath33 photometric error bar at different magnitudes in the bottom - right panel of figure  [ fig : cmdzoom ] .",
    "the results show that for @xmath35 23 the errors in our colors are comparable to the spread seen in the cmd .",
    "this suggests that our photometric errors are also likely dominating the scatter observed on the cmd .",
    "a much better test of the true intrinsic spread along the ngc  6791 white dwarf cooling sequence can be judged from the deep _",
    "hst_/acs cmd of this cluster @xcite .",
    "these data are not affected by photometric errors at these magnitudes .",
    "the @xcite cmd shows clear evidence for a scatter of 0.25  0.30 magnitudes ( in color ) near the tip of the cooling sequence and extending all the way down to the faintest white dwarfs .",
    "this rules out photometric errors and therefore the observed spread must be related to the various evolutionary channels that have led to the formation of these stars , the root of which is the mass loss on the red giant branch .",
    "interestingly , @xcite find that the location of the reddest white dwarfs along their cooling sequence is consistent with pure helium core models of low mass ( 0.32 @xmath6 ) . as we saw in  [ wdmasses ] , the observed spread in masses of the ngc  6791 white dwarfs ranges from 0.36  0.54  @xmath6 and therefore the dominant bluer sequence of white dwarfs in their cmd ( that they fit with carbon - oxygen core models to derive the young age ) actually contains a mixture of these canonical white dwarfs ( those with progenitors in the red giant clump ) and more massive helium core white dwarfs . in our sample of bright white dwarfs , wd  7 ( @xmath3 = 0.53  @xmath6 )",
    "likely represents a star that evolved through this normal channel .",
    "the evolutionary channel discussed above requires some fraction of the stars in ngc  6791 to have experienced enhanced mass loss during their evolution .",
    "there are three primary mechanisms for the total post - main sequence mass loss in stars : stationary winds , dust related outflows , and pulsation related outflows ( e.g. , willson 2000 ) .",
    "the majority of the mass loss takes place while a star is ascending the asymptotic giant branch and evolving through the planetary nebula phase , although the star will also lose an appreciable amount of mass on the red giant branch .",
    "it is not well understood whether this latter mass loss , i.e. , that occurs prior to the horizontal branch phase , is driven primarily via winds on the red giant branch itself or as a result of the helium flash .",
    "however , the amount of the red giant branch mass loss , is a sensitive function of the stellar metallicity , as chemically enriched stars will lose a larger fraction of their total mass .    to estimate the expected mass loss along the red giant branch , we invoke the models of @xcite .",
    "these models provide chemical yields for both low- and intermediate- mass stars evolving from the zero age main sequence to the end of the thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch . the integrated mass loss for a slightly metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath360.7 ) , 1.05 @xmath6 star ( appropriate mass for an ngc  6791 giant ) is 41% of its initial mass",
    ". a solar metallicity star of the same mass will lose 48% of its mass through its evolution .",
    "however , @xmath040% of the solar metallicity star s mass loss will occur on the red giant branch whereas 33% of the [ fe / h ] = @xmath360.7 star s mass loss occurs on the red giant branch . for a metallicity as extreme as ngc  6791 s ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath10.3  @xmath10.5 )",
    ", a star will lose even a larger fraction of its mass on the red giant branch .",
    "@xcite estimate that a 1.08 @xmath6 star with [ fe / h ] = @xmath10.37 will form a core with a mass of just 0.45  0.47  @xmath6 .",
    "these theoretical calculations suggest that the amount of mass loss along the red giant branch of ngc  6791 will yield a final mass of the star at the tip of the branch that is within a few - hundredths of the critical mass needed to ignite helium in the core .",
    "given the stochastic nature of the red giant branch mass loss , some stars in ngc  6791 certainly reached the critical mass whereas others did not . the large internal metallicity dispersion within the cluster ( rms = 0.08 dex ",
    "gratton et  al .",
    "2006 ) will also add to the variable mass loss .",
    "for example , @xcite present low - resolution spectra of k giants and find that one star in this cluster has an extremely high metal abundance , [ fe / h ] = @xmath10.6 .",
    "the theoretical arguments for this mass loss are therefore qualitatively consistent with our conclusions above based on the morphology of the ngc  6791 cmd and the masses of the cluster white dwarfs .",
    "if , in fact , a significant fraction of ngc  6791 s stellar population is peeling away from the red giant branch before the helium flash , then the luminosity function of the cluster s red giant branch should be depleted as one approaches the tip ( see e.g. , sandquist & martel 2007 ) .",
    "an analysis of the cluster s red giant branch by @xcite found that its tip does not rise above @xmath37 @xmath362.7 , over a magnitude fainter than metal - rich globular clusters .",
    "interestingly , the recent study of @xcite compares the metallicity distribution functions of nearby field dwarfs and giants , and finds that the giant distribution lacks a metal - rich tail . to test whether there is a _ thinning _ out of this upper red giant branch , we compare the cluster s red giant branch luminosity function to that of three other old open star clusters , berkeley  17 ( 8.5 gyr ",
    "bragaglia et  al .",
    "2006 ) , m67 ( 4.3 gyr ",
    "richer et  al .  1998 ) , and ngc  188 ( 6.8 gyr  stetson , mcclure , & vandenberg 2004 and references within ) .",
    "we isolate the red giant branch stars from the published cmds in these studies and apply the derived distance moduli to each data set .",
    "we also confirmed that our study is not incomplete near the tip of the red giant branch , where these stars become increasingly redder .",
    "for this , we matched our optical data to the near infrared study of @xcite and were able to recover all of the red giants near the tip .",
    "figure  [ fig : lf ] ( top ) shows the red giant branch luminosity function for each cluster .",
    "we have plotted this with the tip of the branch towards the left of the diagram .",
    "both in ngc  188 ( also a metal - rich cluster ) and ngc  6791 , the luminosity functions are heavily skewed towards the base of the red giant branch .",
    "the decline in the number of stars as the tip is approached is more rapid in ngc  6791 than in all three other clusters . to illustrate this more clearly",
    ", we build cumulative luminosity functions for each cluster in figure  [ fig : lf ] ( bottom ) and adjust each function so the brightest observed giant is shifted to a common magnitude .",
    "this aligning of the tip of the red giant branch has the advantage that it is largely independent of both chemical composition and age @xcite .",
    "the ngc  6791 luminosity function is clearly `` bottom - heavy '' relative to the other clusters , suggesting that there is an absence of red giants near the tip .",
    "this absence is not caused by very red stars that may have escaped detection in our study . to test this further",
    ", we apply a kolmogorov - smirnov",
    "( k - s ) test @xcite between the ngc  6791 luminosity function and each of the other three clusters .",
    "the k - s test makes no assumption about the distribution of the data and is therefore insensitive to possible spurious biases from arbitrary binning of data .",
    "the significance level probability , @xmath38 , that the null hypothesis is true ( i.e. , that the luminosity functions are drawn from the same distribution ) is found to be @xmath320.01 when comparing ngc  6791 to each of berkeley  17 and m67 .",
    "for the two more metal - rich clusters with extreme horizontal branches , ngc  6791 and ngc  188 , the k - s test yields a probability @xmath38 = 0.31 ( i.e. , it can not be shown that these two luminosity functions are drawn from different distributions ) .",
    "the observed white dwarfs in our sample are the brightest objects along the cooling sequence whereas most of the leverage in measuring the white dwarf cooling age of the cluster comes from fainter white dwarfs in the @xcite peak . over these magnitudes ,",
    "stars along this cooling sequence have a very small change in mass ( also true for their progenitors ) .",
    "therefore , the same fate should affect all of these stars unless we have not accounted for a piece of missing physics .",
    "@xcite estimated the number of white dwarfs in the bedin et  al .",
    "cmd that came from each of the three evolutionary channels by considering the lifetimes of stars in the red giant clump , extreme horizontal branch , and white dwarf cooling phases , and by assuming a ratio of extreme horizontal branch stars to red giant clump stars in those data .",
    "the cmd presented in figure  [ fig : cmdzoom ] overlaps the _",
    "hst_/acs study and so we can now refine this calculation . over",
    "the acs field targeted by bedin et  al .",
    ", the cmd of ngc  6791 shows two extreme horizontal branch stars and four red giant clump stars .",
    "the evolutionary timescale for these core helium burning phases lasts approximately 1 @xmath14 10@xmath39 years , whereas the cooling time for the faintest white dwarfs in the hst study is @xmath02 @xmath14 10@xmath40 years ( for carbon - oxygen core models down to @xmath13 = 28 ) .",
    "therefore , scaling arguments suggest that 120 of the white dwarfs in the bedin et  al .",
    "study should have evolved from either of these two evolutionary channels and therefore have carbon - oxygen cores ( two - thirds of which came from the canonical red giant clump phase ) .",
    "the white dwarf cooling sequence of the cluster shows roughly 600 white dwarfs , and therefore up to 80% of the white dwarfs may be helium core stars .    an independent check on these numbers",
    "can now be derived from our mass measurements .",
    "figure  [ fig : massteff ] indicates that the ratio of helium - core to carbon - oxygen core white dwarfs in ngc  6791 is @xmath02:1 , assuming that 0.46  @xmath6 is the threshold at which a carbon - oxygen core will be produced in the progenitor star .",
    "if this critical mass is slightly larger , i.e. , 0.48  @xmath6 , then the ratio may be as large as 8:1 .",
    "since the cooling is a factor of @xmath03@xmath14 slower for the helium core stars , their cluster birthrate is then estimated to be between 40 ",
    "70% of all stars .",
    "the fraction of helium core vs carbon - oxygen core white dwarfs directly affects the inferred cluster white dwarf cooling age as the cooling rates are proportional to the mass number ( chemical species ) of the core .",
    "for example , for a fixed stellar mass , a 50/50 carbon - oxygen mixture will have @xmath03.5@xmath14 fewer ions than a helium core star .",
    "this results in a higher heat capacity for the helium core white dwarf and therefore the cooling will be @xmath03.5@xmath14 slower than that of a carbon - oxygen core white dwarf of similar mass .",
    "this is of course offset slightly by the fact that the mean mass of the helium core stars is somewhat smaller than that of normal carbon - oxygen core white dwarfs ( a relatively small effect in this case ) . by comparing the observed white dwarf luminosity function to model luminosity functions",
    "that invoke pure helium cores , pure carbon - oxygen cores , and a combination of the two , @xcite was able to show that an age of 78  gyr requires the birthrate fraction of helium core white dwarfs in the cluster to be between 50% and 100% of the total white dwarf production .",
    "this is consistent with our findings above .",
    "the ultraviolet upturn in elliptical galaxies and spiral bulges refers to the sharp , rising flux in the integrated spectra of these objects shortward of @xmath41 2500 @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon is found to be extremely variable in different galaxies , and therefore must be very sensitive to the properties of the sources responsible for the upturn .",
    "the dominant , old main - sequence stellar population of these galaxies is too faint , and cool , to constitute any appreciable fraction of this flux",
    ". therefore , the sources must either be young massive stars ( e.g. , in active star formation regions ) or more exotic populations of low - mass , hot stars .",
    "recent results from galex suggest that only in rare cases does the former dominate the ultraviolet flux @xcite . for the latter ,",
    "@xcite consider the energetics of several possible sources including binary candidates , hot or accreting white dwarfs , post asymptotic giant branch stars , and extreme horizontal branch stars and find that the extreme horizontal branch stars are the most likely candidates ( although , see recent study by han , podsiadlowski , & lynas - gray 2007 suggesting a binary model for the excess ) .",
    "these stars are hot , bright , and can establish an equilibrium while burning helium in their cores for @xmath010@xmath43 years .",
    "unfortunately , resolved photometry , or spectroscopy , of the sources for the ultraviolet upturn in these distant galaxies is currently not possible ( although m31 and m32 have been imaged in the ultraviolet - bertola et  al .  1995 ; brown et  al .",
    "2000 ) .    in galactic globular clusters extremely blue horizontal branches have long been argued to exist because of the system s old age , low metallicity , and differential mass loss on the red giant branch @xcite .",
    "however , the properties of these systems ( e.g. , low metallicity , high density ) are contrary to the extragalactic populations @xcite .",
    "recent studies have shown that metal - rich disk clusters also possess an extended blue horizontal branch ( e.g. , rich et  al .",
    "1997 ) , thereby providing nearby systems , with some similar properties to the elliptical galaxies and spiral bulges , that possibly harbor the sources causing the ultraviolet upturn .",
    "given its old age , very high metal abundance , and small distance modulus , ngc  6791 represents a nearby analog of the metal - rich component in these galaxies that can be used to understand the origin of the extra far - ultraviolet radiation ( see also liebert , saffer , & green 1994 ) .",
    "we have shown that the white dwarf population of ngc  6791 is undermassive , a consequence of enhanced mass loss in the evolution of the progenitors of these stars .",
    "the extreme horizontal branch stars of ngc  6791 are a subset of this population , those that lost mass on the red giant branch but not enough to prevent the ignition of helium while the star was well on its way to becoming a white dwarf .",
    "this type of evolution clearly suggests that even within a co - eval system with little metallicity spread , the mass loss is variable .",
    "of course this effect would be compounded in a system such as an elliptical galaxy which has a large spread in both metallicity and age relative to an open cluster .",
    "furthermore , as we mentioned earlier , the amount of ultraviolet flux in these galaxies is found to vary enormously from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "the variable excess likely depends sensitively on the number of extreme horizontal branch stars and could even be susceptible to their specific location along the extreme horizontal branch . the stochastic mass loss , due to the metallicity ,",
    "could therefore be a contributor in dictating the amount of this ultraviolet flux in ellipticals and spiral bulges .",
    "other sources , such as the presence of a minority population of helium enhanced stars @xcite , may also be important .    in total , about 30% of the ngc  6791 helium burning stars are hot ( including the new ones found by buson et  al .",
    "of course , this is an extreme case considering the very high metallicity of the cluster ; slightly lower metallicity populations are expected to produce a smaller fraction .",
    "@xcite construct synthetic population models and find that even for the bluest galaxies , a fraction of just 15  20% of the stars would need to become extreme horizontal branch stars to explain the ultraviolet colors . therefore the production of extreme horizontal branch stars in an environment such as ngc  6791 is certainly sufficient to explain the ultraviolet upturn in elliptical galaxies and spiral bulges .",
    "if , in fact , the amount of excess ultraviolet radiation in these systems increases with metallicity , then this could directly correlate with the picture of enhanced mass loss in metal - rich systems that would produce a larger fraction of the sources of the radiation .",
    "however , the jury is still out on whether such a trend exists .",
    "for example , burstein et  al .",
    "( 1988 ) see a positive correlation between the ultraviolet excess and metallicity whereas other studies do not ( e.g. , rich et  al .  2005 ) .",
    "we have presented the first spectroscopic observations of the white dwarf population of the metal - rich open star cluster ngc  6791 .",
    "two - thirds of the white dwarfs in this cluster are found to be undermassive , well below the @xmath44 0.46  @xmath6 threshold at which helium would have ignited in the cores of the progenitor red giant branch stars to produce carbon - oxygen .",
    "these helium - core white dwarfs have formed in this cluster as a result of enhanced mass loss on the red giant branch , due to the high metallicity of the cluster ( [ fe / h ] @xmath0 @xmath10.4 ) .",
    "this scenario naturally provides an explanation for the recently reported low white dwarf cooling age of ngc  6791 by @xcite ; helium - core white dwarfs cool a factor of @xmath03@xmath14 slower than carbon - oxygen core white dwarfs and therefore their measurement of 2.4  gyr would actually imply a cooling age of @xmath77  gyr , consistent with the well measured main - sequence turnoff age .",
    "the enhanced mass loss also explains the presence of the extreme horizontal branch stars in this cluster which are plausible analogs of the sources responsible for the ultraviolet upturn in elliptical galaxies and spiral bulges .",
    "interestingly , a recent study by @xcite has reported that there is a significant analogous field population of low mass , single white dwarfs that arises from old , metal - rich stars that suffered severe mass loss and avoided the helium flash .",
    "therefore , the results in this paper are likely a general consequence of stellar evolution in high metallicity environments    finally , it is worth noting that these results do not rule out that the cooling rate of some of ngc  6791 s white dwarfs has been retarded from the sedimentation of @xmath45ne @xcite .",
    "@xmath45ne is produced during helium burning and so the helium core white dwarfs would be unaffected , however , this could represent a heating mechanism for the carbon - oxygen core stars .",
    "the rate at which @xmath45ne settles into the core depends on internal physics that are currently not well understood .",
    "further investigation of this heating source will likely clarify how dominant this effect is in a metal - rich environment such as ngc  6791 .",
    "other explanations related to white dwarf physics , binarity , or enhanced helium abundances may yet emerge .",
    "future observations of ngc  6791 may be able to confirm our picture .",
    "ground based observations of the cluster red giants in the mid - infrared could potentially show signs of the enhanced mass loss ( e.g. , through a 10 micron excess ) .",
    "a deeper study of the cluster white dwarfs should also be undertaken with _",
    "such observations should unveil a second peak in the white dwarf luminosity function resulting from the cooling of canonical carbon - oxygen core white dwarfs .",
    "the second epoch data could also provide for a much cleaner study of cluster stars through proper motion selection .",
