    "a recurring problem in modern physics is how to add quantization effects to a basically successful macroscopic theory .",
    "this question arises particularly in the semiclassical regime ",
    "large quantum number  where the quantum effects are often corrections to the essentially classical macroscopic physics .",
    "perhaps the best known example starts with the thomas - fermi theory of the atom  @xcite , which is macroscopic in essence , and then evaluates the contribution of electronic shell structure to the ground state energy  @xcite .",
    "the very natural result that the shell contribution is given by the quantized levels of the self - consistent thomas - fermi potential has been used extensively  @xcite .",
    "however , it has only been in recent decades , starting with the work of v. m. strutinsky  @xcite , that a systematic way of answering the recurring general problem has been developed .",
    "our own immediate interest is in quantum dots  small electrically conducting regions in which the quantum properties of the confined electrons are important  @xcite  and our aim here is to treat quantum corrections to the ground state energy of these dots by further developing the strutinsky method .",
    "quantum dots can be formed , for instance , by gate depletion of a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in a gaas - algaas heterostructure .",
    "because of the high quality of this material and interface , the mean free path of the electrons far exceeds the size of the quantum dot .",
    "one can view an electron as propagating ballistically within a confining potential created by electrostatic gates patterned on the surface of the heterostructure . for transport measurements ,",
    "dots can be coupled weakly to leads ; when the conductance of each lead falls below @xmath0 , electron transport through the dot occurs only by tunneling , and the number of particles within the dot becomes quantized . in this regime ,",
    "the conductance is suppressed due to the electrostatic energy associated with a localized charge  @xcite , an effect known as the coulomb blockade ( first reported in 1951 by gorter @xcite ) . when the dot potential is tuned by a gate voltage so that adding one electron costs no energy , a large conductance peak appears @xcite  though the electrons must still tunnel from the leads , there is no additional electrostatic barrier to conduction .",
    "sweeping such a gate voltage produces periodic coulomb blockade oscillations of the conductance through dots @xcite .",
    "the coulomb blockade is a classical effect observable in a broad temperature range , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the total dot capacitance . over most of this range , both",
    "the spacing and height of the peaks is constant  the spacing is @xmath3 and the height is given by the resistance of the two tunneling barriers acting in series .",
    "however , there is a low temperature regime below a few hundred millikelvin for which @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the mean single - particle level spacing of the isolated dot .",
    "there , quantum interference and coherence become important @xcite .",
    "the coulomb blockade peaks grow as the temperature decreases , and novel fluctuation properties emerge involving both the peak heights @xcite and spacings  @xcite .",
    "the spacings give information about the ground state energies while the heights involve the magnitude of the wavefunction near the levels .    with some success , random - matrix - theory ( rmt ) based approaches",
    "@xcite have been used in order first to predict @xcite and then to explain the statistical properties found . in the simplest approximation @xcite , known as the constant interaction model",
    ", the ground state energy of the dot is expressed as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the number of electrons in the dot and @xmath8 are single - particle energies .",
    "the first term is the classical charging energy ; the second is the total energy of a system of non - interacting quasi - particles . supposing that the single - particle classical dynamics within the dot is chaotic , the bohigas - giannoni - schmit conjecture applies  @xcite and implies that the single - particle quantum properties follow rmt .",
    "it is well - established that rmt predicts repulsion amongst the @xmath8 and gaussian random behavior in the eigenfunctions  @xcite . within this model ,",
    "the conductance peak height statistics are in good agreement with experimental results@xcite after also incorporating non - zero temperature effects and interference modulations due to periodic paths coupled to the leads  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it is found  @xcite that the fluctuations in the peak spacings are considerably larger than the predictions  @xcite , and there is no evidence for the level repulsion or electron spin degeneracy expected from a single - particle - like approach  @xcite .",
    "these discrepancies between the predictions of the constant interaction model and the observations point to the need for a quantum treatment of the electron - electron interactions , and , in particular , have triggered a number of studies based on hartree - fock calculations  @xcite , or density functional theory in the local density approximation ( lda )  @xcite .    in nuclear physics , it has been recognized for some time that the dependence of nuclear ground state properties on the particle number can be viewed as the sum of two contributions , a `` smooth part '' which varies smoothly with the particle number and an `` oscillatory behavior '' producing the shell structure referred to as shell corrections .",
    "a similar decomposition is possible for any finite - size interacting fermion system .",
    "the smooth part comes basically from the bulk energy per unit volume integrated over the finite - size system , and the oscillating contributions come from quantum interference effects explicitly caused by the confinement . by supposing that the smooth part is known while the unknown oscillatory contribution is a correction , strutinsky proposed in the 60 s a physically motivated approach to , and an efficient way of calculating , the shell corrections  @xcite .",
    "strutinsky s shell correction method is essentially a _",
    "semiclassical _ approximation .",
    "it rests on the fact that the number of particles in the system considered is large , rather than on the interaction between the particles being weak .",
    "( one must , of course , work in a regime where the smooth starting point is basically valid . ) since the quantum dots in which we are interested contain on the order of a hundred electrons , they are a perfect place to apply the strutinsky method .",
    "however , before doing so for a particular , realistic , two - dimensional geometry , we shall in this paper limit ourselves to a formal discussion of this method in conjunction with a one - dimensional illustrative example . in spite of the literature existing on this subject  @xcite",
    ", we find it useful for two main purposes .",
    "first , the discussion and resulting expressions are noticeably simpler for quantum dots than for nuclei .",
    "this occurs because the existence of a smooth confining potential in the dot means that gradient corrections to the smooth density are not needed to confine the system at the zeroth - order ( classical - like ) approximation .",
    "the effect of these gradient terms can therefore be included in the first - order `` shell '' corrections , simplifying both the zeroth - order calculations ( no gradient terms ) and the first - order terms ( no corrections to the weyl part ) .",
    "our main purpose , however , is to take advantage of the fact that we use density functional theory rather than hartree - fock as a starting point , the former being presumably better suited to deal with the long - range coulomb interaction present in quantum dots than the latter .",
    "this allows us to discuss in detail the second - order `` residual interaction '' terms of the strutinsky method . by residual interaction",
    "we mean the weak interaction between landau quasi - particles that comes from dressing the bare electron added to the quantum dot .",
    "in particular we will show , and illustrate , how these terms are related to the screened coulomb interaction .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the thomas - fermi and density functional theories are summarized in the next section , establishing our notation .",
    "section  [ strutth ] contains the strutinsky method applied to density functional theory .",
    "this is the core of the paper ; in particular , the relation of the second order terms to the screened coulomb potential is derived .",
    "section  [ peakspc ] recalls how the residual interaction terms contribute to conductance peak spacing distribution .",
    "section  [ numcalc ] compares the whole approximation scheme to numerical calculations of a simplified model : interacting electrons in a one - dimensional quartic oscillator .",
    "finally , we comment on the relationship between the strutinsky development and the constant interaction model , and possible applications of the method .",
    "the hohenberg - kohn theorem  @xcite states that for a system of interacting electrons in an external potential , @xmath9 , there exists a functional , @xmath10 $ ] , of the density of electrons , @xmath11 , such that : i )  the density , @xmath12 , corresponding to the ground state of @xmath7 particles is an extremum of @xmath10 $ ] under the constraint that the total number of particles , @xmath13 \\equiv \\int d{{\\bf r}}\\ , n_g({{\\bf r } } ) \\ ; , \\ ] ] is fixed , and ii )  @xmath14 $ ] is the total energy of the system .",
    "the explicit form of the hohenberg - kohn - sham functional is not known  @xcite . in practice , one must be satisfied with approximations .",
    "we describe here first a generalized thomas - fermi approach and , second , the case when an explicit form of the density functional is assumed .",
    "it is convenient to view the density functional as the sum of three parts : a classical charge contribution , the kinetic energy , and the unknown exchange - correlation functional which accounts for the balance  @xcite .",
    "the first part is simple : the energy of a system of classical charges confined by an external potential , @xmath15 , is @xmath16 = { { \\cal e}_{\\rm ext}}[n]+{{\\cal e}_{\\rm coul}}[n]\\ ] ] where @xmath17 & = & \\int n({\\bf r } ) { v_{\\rm ext}}({\\bf r } ) d{\\bf r}\\nonumber\\\\ { { \\cal e}_{\\rm coul}}[n ] & = & { e^2 \\over 2 } \\int\\int { n({\\bf r})n({\\bf r } ' ) \\over |{\\bf r}-{\\bf r}'| } d{\\bf r } d{\\bf r } ' \\ ; .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for the kinetic energy , in the thomas - fermi approach the pauli exclusion principle is introduced semiclassically by employing the idea that one quantum state occupies a volume @xmath18 in phase space .",
    "this implies that if many electrons want to be at the same place , they can do so only by increasing their kinetic energy .",
    "this gives the thomas - fermi approximation to the kinetic energy part of the density functional , @xmath19 $ ] , expressed as @xmath20 = \\int { t_{\\rm tf}}\\bigl ( n({\\bf r})\\bigr ) d{\\bf r } \\label{eq : ttf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the dimensionality of the system , @xmath22 is the heaviside step function , @xmath23 is the kinetic energy density , and @xmath24 is the number of states per unit volume with energy less than @xmath25 .",
    "a factor 2 in @xmath24 is required if the electron spin degeneracy is taken into account .",
    "finally , the effect of exchange and correlation is included through a term @xmath26 $ ] . in practice , an explicit form for",
    "this functional must be taken .",

    "then , the density functional is @xmath27={{\\cal t}_{\\rm tf}}[n]+{{\\cal e}_{\\rm tot}}[n]\\ ] ] where @xmath28 \\equiv { { \\cal e}_{\\rm ext}}[n]+ { { \\cal e}_{\\rm coul}}[n]+{{\\cal e}_{\\rm xc}}[n ] \\ ; .\\ ] ] the ground state energy and its electron distribution are obtained by minimizing @xmath29 under the constraint ( [ eq : contrainte ] ) , yielding the self - consistency equation @xmath30({\\bf r } ) + { v_{\\rm eff}}[{n_{\\rm gtf}}]({\\bf      r } ) = \\mu_{\\rm gtf}\\ ] ] with the effective potential @xmath31({\\bf r } ) \\equiv      { \\delta { { \\cal e}_{\\rm tot}}\\over \\delta n}[n]({\\bf r } ) \\ ; .\\ ] ] notice that to make use of eq .",

    "the kinetic energy is treated quantum mechanically rather than ( semi)classically as in gtf . to accomplish this",

    "in order to actually solve the kohn - sham equations , an explicit form for the exchange - correlation functional is required .",
    "the simplest case is when @xmath32 is an integral over space of a function ( _ not _ functional ) of the local density ; this is the well - known local - density approximation ( lda ) .",

    "in this section we develop an approximation to @xmath44 $ ] starting from the solution of the generalized - thomas - fermi equation , @xmath45 .",
    "the main motivation is to develop a physical interpretation of the difference between these two approaches in finding the ground state energy . in addition , the approximation is of interest numerically for large problems since it involves a self - consistent solution of only the gtf equation rather than the more involved kohn - sham equations .",
    "we use the method introduced by v.  m.  strutinsky  @xcite originally in the context of a hartree - fock rather than density - functional approach .",
    "his method describes the interacting system self consistently , first with the quantum interference effects turned off , and then by introducing them perturbatively .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the idea is to add the `` oscillatory '' effects caused by interference in the confined system to a `` smooth '' essentially macroscopic description ",
    "these effects are essentially the friedel oscillations  @xcite familiar in the context of impurities or surfaces .    to study the role of quantum interference effects in the dft ground state energy , we will first show that the generalized - thomas - fermi result is a [ semi]classical approximation to the dft energy .",
    "the gtf approximation does , of course , contain some quantum mechanics  notably the pauli exclusion principle which gives rise to the fermi surface  and so is not truly classical .",

    "to see this clearly , we introduce a convenient notation adapted from the semiclassical treatment of single - particle problems : it is customary there to express the density of states as a sum of a smooth term slowly varying in energy , called the weyl part , and a term which varies rapidly in energy ( on the scale of the mean level separation ) , called the oscillatory part @xcite . for a system governed by the hamiltonian @xmath46 \\equiv { \\bf p}^2 /2 m + v({\\bf r})$ ] , where the potential is as yet unspecified",

    "this is an integral equation for @xmath84 in terms of gtf quantities .",

    "( [ eq : deltae2 ] ) , can be written @xmath120    thus the second - order correction is simply the energy of interaction between the additional charge oscillations caused by the quantization , where the interaction is screened because , after all , the `` other '' electrons treated in gtf are around .",
    "note that @xmath118 is the screened interaction within the finite sized system , not in the bulk , and so includes boundary effects  @xcite ; under certain conditions , the bulk screened potential may be used  @xcite .",

    "systems tend not to be purely chaotic , and even when chaotic , still exhibit manifestations of short time dynamics in their eigenproperties .",
    "this can often lead to important deviations from statistical limiting behaviors .",
    "we therefore briefly sketch the relationship between the residual interaction and the coulomb blockade peak spacings .",
    "the position of a conductance peak as a function of gate voltage is proportional to the change in the total energy of the system when an electron is added @xcite , @xmath121 and the conductance peak spacing is proportional to the discrete inverse compressibility @xmath122 for each of the ground state energies here we will insert the second - order strutinsky approximation to the dft energy .",
    "the first term , @xmath92 , is the ground state energy in the generalized - thomas - fermi approximation , and is essentially the charging energy of the dot .",
    "the first - order correction contains the single - particle quantization effects .",
    "in some sense these two terms together constitute the same level of approximation as the much used constant interaction model .",

    "let us now illustrate the above approach with a particular example . for the sake of simplicity ,",

    "we emphasize that our interest in this simple model system is only as an illustration for better understanding of the strutinsky method .",
    "we vary the electron charge @xmath128 to see how well the strutinsky scheme works for different strengths of the interaction , @xmath129 and @xmath130 in units where @xmath131 .",

    "can be readily understood by looking at the lower panel of fig .  5 , which shows the effective thomas - fermi potential @xmath70 $ ] for @xmath183 , @xmath182 . here",
    ", one sees that the latter has developed a barrier at the center of the well , the top of which lies very close to the chemical potential . for the quantum case",
    ", this means that the one particle levels below the fermi energy are organized as quasi - doublets .",
    "this naturally leads to an odd - even effect since for n even ( odd ) , the last occupied orbital has an energy consistently below ( above ) that suggested by the weyl approximation .",
    "moreover , because the last occupied orbitals are close to the chemical potential and so near the top of the barrier , it is clear that semiclassical approximations will be `` at risk '' here .",
    "this is clearly seen for instance in figs .  6 and 7 , which , for coupling @xmath182 and @xmath184 and @xmath146 particles , shows a comparison between the exact @xmath185 and its approximation obtained using eq .",
    "( [ eq : screening ] ) .",
    "the two curves are almost on top of each other everywhere , except in the middle of the well  that is , near the maxima of the barrier . in addition",
    ", one observes that in that place , the approximation is worse for an odd than for an even number of particles .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that in the former case the last occupied orbital is symmetric and thus has a probability maximum at the origin , while in the latter case the last occupied orbital is antisymmetric and so goes to zero . as a consequence",
    "the errors in the strutinsky approximation scheme also display an odd - even structure clearly seen in fig .",
    "5 . if , however , one concentrates on the even case , where the effect of the central barrier is less important , without correction terms the error is about 0.2 , with the first - order correction the error is reduced to 0.02 , and further reduced to about 0.003 if one includes the second - order corrections .",
    "turning now to the inverse compressibility @xmath186 introduced in sect .",
    "[ peakspc ] , we observe the same trend as for the groundstate energy .",
    "the approximation @xmath187 , calculated strictly by the thomas - fermi approximation , already gives an excellent relative precision .",
    "moreover , for @xmath181 and @xmath147 , each term in the strutinsky development significantly reduces the error ( i.e.  an order of magnitude or more for @xmath188 ) . for these cases",
    "however the approximation is already much better than the mean spacing @xmath5 if the first correction is included .",
    "we therefore show the data only for @xmath182 , for which the corrections are enhanced by the proximity of the chemical potential to the top of the inner barrier . in fig .",
    "8(a ) , the @xmath186 are shown .",
    "the discrete points represent the full quantum calculations and are taken as the reference points .",
    "it is seen that @xmath187 does not capture the odd - even double - well effect , but otherwise captures the essential peak spacing behavior . in fig .",
    "8(b ) , the relative errors are shown as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "more specifically , the difference between the quantum @xmath186 and one , two , or three terms of the strutinsky series@xmath187 , @xmath189 and @xmath190 , respectively  is divided by @xmath5 , the mean level separation .",
    "it is seen that the majority of the odd - even , double - well effect is captured by the first correction term .",
    "reassuringly , even in this case for which the inner barrier degrades the quality of the semiclassical development , each inclusion of an extra term in the series reduces somewhat the relative errors of the strutinsky method .",
    "moreover the improvement due to the addition of the second order correction becomes more significant with increasing @xmath7 .",
    "thus we see that even in this more difficult case , the strutinsky method gives a excellent scheme of approximation in the semiclassical limit .",
    "we have developed an approximate series expansion for studying the ground state of interacting systems using the idea of the strutinsky shell correction method .",
    "we tested the validity of the strutinsky scheme by numerical calculations of interacting electron systems in a one - dimensional , externally applied quartic potential . by varying the electron charge strength",
    ", we were able to confirm the stability of the method .",
    "it approximated extremely well the quantum mechanical dft quantities using [ semi]classical thomas - fermi data for three different charge strengths .",
    "one exceptional circumstance giving less reliable results was noted with respect to a barrier in @xmath104 approaching the chemical potential .",
    "the calculations show a tendency for the series to converge as electron number increases .",
    "this is consistent with expectations for systems with large numbers of particles because of the increasing reliability of the thomas - fermi calculations as the system goes deeper into the semiclassical regime .",
    "the method discussed in this paper could serve two purposes . on one hand",
    ", it gave us an efficient way to proceed with numerical calculations , and it is conceivable that this approach could be of some help for larger scale , realistic dft calculations  @xcite . on the other hand , it also provides some physical insight by decomposing the total dft energy into various contributions , each of them receiving an intuitive interpretation .    in the context of quantum dots , for instance ,",
    "one of its simple but presumably useful applications could be to justify , and make more precise , the constant interaction model .",
    "indeed , this latter is usually presented as an ad - hoc model motivated essentially by its simplicity . here , up to some reinterpretation of what is the capacitance of the dot , we see that the constant interaction model can be understood as the first - order approximation in a strutinsky development of a dft calculation .",
    "one obtains , in addition , that the various parameters of the model ( classical energy and potential governing the motion of the independent particles ) are specified , and , in principle , can be computed explicitly .",
    "this makes it possible , for instance , to study the sensitivity of the dot s energy to the variation of an external parameter @xcite .    in the same way ,",
    "the second - order correction term gives insight into the `` residual '' interactions between electrons . in the context of dft",
    "it gives some basis to the fact that electrons in quantum dots behave as landau quasi - particles interacting weakly through a screened coulomb interaction .",
    "it moreover explicitly specifies how the screening process is affected by the confinement of the electrons , which might be relevant in the limit where the screening length is not much smaller than the size of the dots .    with the failure of the theoretical predictions of the single - particle constant - interaction model to explain the experimentally observed conductance peak spacing distributions  @xcite , our original interest was to investigate what physical factors are missing and to understand better the statistical behaviors of quantum dots .",
    "we expect that the approach of defining the many - body system , explicitly including electron - electron interactions within density functional theory , to bring us closer to a resolution of the failure of the constant interaction model in this context .",
