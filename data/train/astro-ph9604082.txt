    "proto - planetary nebulae ( ppn ) occur in the poorly understood transition between the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and planetary nebula ( pn ) stages of stellar evolution .",
    "as a star moves up the agb , it loses mass at an increasing rate , culminating in a final cataclysmic superwind ( @xcite ) . the end of mass - loss signals the transition to the beginning of the ppn phase ( @xcite ) . at this point",
    ", the central star with a typical core mass of @xmath2 and temperature of @xmath3 k ( @xcite ) evolves blueward in the hr diagram , its temperature increasing as it loses additional envelope mass through hydrogen shell burning , until it reaches @xmath4 k necessary to ionize the circumstellar shell and produce a pn .",
    "the ionization of the nebula defines the end of the ppn stage .",
    "the typical ages of pn , the large dust densities required for their formation , and the minimum central star temperature needed to ionize the ejected gas strongly constrain the duration of the ppn phase to a few thousand years ( @xcite ) .",
    "some ppn have easily discernable bipolar morphologies reminiscent of `` butterfly '' pn , in which the central star illuminates two diametrically opposed , symmetric lobes of nebulosity ( @xcite ) .",
    "butterfly pn structure is generally attributed to a density contrast characterized by the presence of a higher concentration of dust in an equatorial plane around the central star and an interacting wind , where a hot wind plows into a previously ejected , slow moving envelope ( @xcite ) .",
    "the morphological similarity between bipolar ppn and butterfly pn , and their evolutionary relation , allow us to interpret the objects in an analagous manner .",
    "morris ( 1981 ) investigated the dust distributions that would reproduce bipolar reflection nebulae and found that a density contrast was a necessary criterion .",
    "a waist of dust blocks the light from the star in the equatorial region , while starlight emerging into the lower density lobes of the polar regions experiences less extinction .",
    "his dust distributions reproduce the `` horns '' seen in some bipolar ppn ; they are caused by changes in the optical depth structure of the lobes .",
    "the equatorial density enhancement appears well founded .",
    "observational evidence indicates that such dust distributions begin forming well before the ppn stage ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , full development of lobe structure , in agreement with the scattering models of morris , and by analogy with the butterfly pn scenario of balick , requires an interacting wind",
    ". herein lies one of the most puzzling aspects of ppn ; namely , where does the second wind come from ? if we accept , for the moment , that some mechanism is capable of producing a fast wind and we account for the rapid evolution of the post - agb central stars , then ppn may lie along a morphological sequence related to their age / evolutionary state .",
    "they evolve from young systems with totally obscured central stars surrounded by reflection nebulae ( e.g. afgl 2688 , oh 0739@xmath014 ) , to middle - aged systems in which the circumstellar material has been sufficiently dispersed to reveal the central star ( e.g. frosty leo ) , to old systems in which the central star has begun to photoionize the surrounding nebula , which is then seen in both reflection and emission ( e.g. m2 - 9 , mz-3 ) ( for examples see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this sequence is admittedly based on a small sample of transition objects whose ages are poorly known .",
    "furthermore , some ppn have completely obscured central stars and photoionized central cavities ( e.g. afgl 618 ; @xcite ) ; possibly evolving so quickly as to appear with both young and old features .",
    "nevertheless , we proceed with our data interpretation in the context of this intuitive , albeit loosely defined , evolutionary sequence .",
    "wolstencroft , scarrott , and menzies ( 1989 ) discovered a bipolar reflection nebula at the position of the infrared object iras  07131@xmath00147 ( galactic coordinates l=217@xmath5 , b=+4.7@xmath5 ) during a search for optical counterparts of iras sources with peak flux densities at @xmath6 .",
    "they classified the nebula as a ppn of intermediate age based on the fact that the lobes are seen in reflection only and the central star is relatively unobscured .",
    "the central star was found to be oxygen - rich and classified as spectral type m5 iii based upon strong tio bands in its optical spectrum and a @xmath7 silicate feature in the iras @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 ( lrs ) ( scarrot et al .",
    "1990 , hereafter s90 ) .",
    "the iras lrs is consistent with ppn model spectra ; furthermore , the rising flux from 10 to 20 @xmath11 indicates that iras  07131@xmath00147 is somewhat evolved ( @xcite ) .",
    "the latter feature is characteristic of an evacuated cavity created as the dust shell expands away from the central star and cools .",
    "the optical morphology and iras data suggest that the nebula has evolved considerably , yet the central star has not started moving toward hotter temperatures as single star evolutionary calculations predict . in this paper",
    ", we present near - infrared imaging and an optical spectrum of iras  07131@xmath00147 that allow us to refine our understanding of the physical nature of this interesting transitional object .",
    "on 1995 april 16 ut we obtained near - infrared images of iras  07131@xmath00147 under photometric conditions using the lick observatory 3 m telescope and the lirc ii mercury - cadmium - telluride 256@xmath12256 pixel camera .",
    "broadband @xmath13 ( 1.10 to 1.44 ) and @xmath14 ( 1.95 to 2.35 @xmath11 ) filters were utilized .",
    "the intermediate field - of - view optical configuration on the telescope yielded a pixel size of @xmath15 and full image area covering 1.62@xmath16@xmath121.62@xmath16 which provided good sampling of the psf in the 1.5 arcsec seeing conditions .",
    "we implemented an observing strategy of 30 and 15 second exposures in a four - point , on - source dithering pattern ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively ) , optimally exposing the target star and providing the images needed to construct sky flats .",
    "we derived coordinate offsets for each image from the centroids of several bright stars .",
    "the sky flattened images were then offset and median combined to create final , 150 second cumulative exposure images in both @xmath13 and @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath13 image is presented in fig .  1 ( plate 1 )",
    ". transformation equations from instrumental to standard @xmath13 and @xmath17 magnitudes , including a zero point offset and extinction coefficients , were calculated from concurrent observations of three standard stars in the ukirt faint standard list taken at airmasses ranging from 1.0 to 2.1 .",
    "we find the central star in iras  07131@xmath00147 to have @xmath13 = 9.92 @xmath18 0.10 mag and @xmath19 mag .",
    "we compared the stellar profile of the ppn central star to field stars in our images and found no evidence for a non - stellar profile in the former . in magnitudes per pixel ,",
    "the lobes have peak intensities of @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , with uncertainties of order 0.1 to 0.2 mag .",
    "the eastern lobe is brighter and more extended than the western lobe .",
    "this was also observed by s90 in optical images and suggests a non - zero angle of inclination relative to the plane of the sky . on the other hand",
    ", the similar level of polarization found in both lobes by s90 suggests an inclination near zero .",
    "we return to this in  4 ; however , we note that if the difference in brightness between the eastern and western lobes is due to the inclination of the nebula , then one expects the fainter lobe to be redder than the brighter lobe .",
    "synthetic aperture photometry ( beam diameter = 18@xmath24 ; central star subtracted ) performed on the east and west lobes in the @xmath13 and @xmath17 images of iras  07131@xmath00147 indicates that the faint western lobe ( @xmath25 ) is bluer than the bright eastern lobe ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "iras  07131@xmath00147 , like iras  09371 + 1212 ( @xcite ) and oh  0739@xmath014 ( @xcite ) , is a ppn whose lobe colors demand a more sophisticated geometrical interpretation .",
    "in contrast to the optical images of s90 , which show bright ridges of clumpy knots located approximately 7 arcseconds to the east and west of the central star , our @xmath13 image shows peak intensities inside this region .",
    "the nebulosity in the @xmath17 image ( not shown ) does not extend quite as far from the central star as in the @xmath13 image , but is otherwise very similar . using the midpoint of the horns at the outer edges of the nebula to define the polar axis",
    ", we find deviations from plane symmetry inside the ridge region . the peak intensity levels in the eastern lobe bend slightly to the north while in the western lobe they bend to the south . in fig .  2 we have plotted the @xmath13 band intensity profiles perpendicular to the polar axis at 2 pixel intervals to the east and west of the central star .",
    "these profiles clearly demonstrate evidence for point reflection symmetry near the central star .",
    "this is a relatively rare characteristic in bipolar nebulae and can possibly be understood in the context of a precessing jet in a binary system ( @xcite ) .",
    "we find no distance for iras  07131@xmath00147 in the literature and have attempted to estimate one from our @xmath17 photometry of the central star .",
    "a sample of 14 m giants in baade s window were observed by frogel and whitford ( 1987 ) .",
    "they found a median @xmath17 magnitude of 9.2 with a spread of @xmath27 mag . using their distance modulus of 14.2",
    ", we adopt the absolute @xmath17 magnitude calibration of @xmath28 0.7 mag for an m5 giant .",
    "we ignore the possible effect of a high bulge metallicity in this analysis and note that the advantage of using a reasonably large sample of m5 giants at a known distance instead of a single calibrating object outweighs this concern .",
    "this yields a distance of 6.5 @xmath18 3 kpc for iras  07131@xmath00147 .",
    "the ( @xmath29 ) color of + 0.87 for the central star is slightly bluer than the median ( de - reddened ) color of the sample of galactic m giants ( @xmath29 = + 0.97 ) , implying negligible reddening .",
    "this is also consistent with the nebula being in a generally evolved state .",
    "the neutral hydrogen density at this galactic latitude and longitude would contribute negligible foreground reddening in the @xmath17 band .",
    "we note that applying our magnitude calibration to the published infrared photometry of oh  0739@xmath014 , which also contains an m giant central star , yields a distance for that ppn in agreement with previous estimates ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "clearly , however , these are not `` normal '' m giants . given the peculiar nature of the central star and its poorly understood evolutionary state ( @xcite ) , we consider our distance estimate for iras  07131@xmath00147 an upper limit .    at a distance of 6",
    "kpc , the angular extent of the east lobe in the optical images of s90 corresponds to an approximate size of 1.2 pc .",
    "molecular line profiles indicate bipolar wind velocities of order tens to hundreds of km  sec@xmath30 in ppn ( @xcite ) . adopting a wind velocity of 100 km  sec@xmath30",
    ", we estimate a dynamical age for iras  07131@xmath00147 of around 12,000 years . under the same assumptions , the east lobe",
    "as seen in our near - infrared image would have a dynamical age of approximately 5000 years .",
    "although the uncertainty in the age is probably a factor of two or three , it is consistent with the general properties of this ppn ; in particular , the evolved dust distribution .",
    "adopting the standard ruler assumption for ppn ( @xmath31 m ; @xcite ) gives a distance of 1.3 kpc and an age of 2300 years .",
    "the central star , in this case , would be 3.6 magnitudes fainter than the median absolute @xmath17 magnitude of galactic bulge m giants .",
    "we obtained a single , 10 min exposure , low resolution ( 8    in blue , 12    in red ) optical spectrum of iras  07131@xmath00147 on 1995 december 6 ut using the double imaging spectrograph ( dis ) on the apache point observatory ( apo ) 3.5 m telescope . after passing through a @xmath32 slit , incoming starlight",
    "is split into two separately - collimated beams by a dichroic with a transition wavelength of 5350   .",
    "each beam then passes through a separate grating and falls onto a detector .",
    "the `` blue '' side utilizes a 150 line / mm grating with a thinned , uv - coated @xmath33 site ccd ; the `` red '' side utilizes a 300 line / mm grating with a thinned @xmath34 ti ccd .",
    "the grating tilts were set to give wavelength ranges of 38005800  on the blue side and 580010000    on the red side .",
    "the spectrograph slit was aligned with the long axis of iras  07131@xmath00147 for the exposure .",
    "the spectrum of the central star , as shown in fig .",
    "3 , is that of a late - type giant ( as reported by @xcite and s90 ) , showing prominent tio absorption bands .",
    "the spectrum of the eastern lobe is almost identical , attesting to the fact that most of the light emerging from the lobe is scattered from the central star .",
    "the fainter western lobe was not detected .",
    "numerical models in which each emergent photon is singly scattered by a dust grain in the nebula have been used to reproduce the observed intensity contours of ppn and to estimate their inclinations ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "iras  07131@xmath00147 displays a very high degree of polarization ( 6070% ; @xcite ) , suggesting that the number of photon scatterings is small ( @xcite ) and recommending the single - grain scattering method .",
    "we followed the procedure of morris ( 1981 ) , integrating over an emission coefficient per unit volume due to scattering along the line - of - sight to the nebula , projected onto a grid in the plane of the sky .",
    "the scattering is assumed to be isotropic and we include absorption of the scattered light along the line - of - sight .",
    "the dust distribution is that produced by a constant velocity outflow of dust in the nebula , modified so that the density falls off rapidly beyond some critical latitude ( ensuring that the nebula becomes optically thin at high latitudes ) .",
    "this approximates a low density `` cone '' along the polar axis in each lobe shaped by a fast wind from the central star .",
    "we used the dust distribution of morris s model  1d ( 1981 ) , which decreases exponentially in latitude with an e - folding length of @xmath35 and a cut - off latitude of @xmath36 .",
    "this model provides a reasonable reproduction of the observed ppn .",
    "the theoretical intensity contours for the adopted dust distribution at four different inclination angles are shown in fig .",
    "the model is clearly idealized in several respects .",
    "for example , it does not reproduce the point symmetry in the inner lobe regions .",
    "furthermore , it does not reproduce the enhanced `` ridges '' seen prominently in the optical images and less so in our near - infrared images . after experimenting with a number of dust distributions modified from model  1d",
    ", we found that the inclination determined from an axial profile was not a strong function of the dust distribution among similar distributions . in short , a simple polar axis intensity profile best measures the inclination while intensity contours best constrain the dust distribution .",
    "profiles with zero inclination have lobes of equal intensity . increasing the inclination angle increases the relative difference in intensity between the lobes .",
    "this is shown in fig .  5 , where we present the polar axis intensity profiles corresponding to the different intensity contours of fig .  4 .",
    "from an observational point of view , we can `` smooth over '' those morphological features in our images which can not be reproduced by the model nebulae and measure the inclination using the polar axis intensity profile .",
    "the critical assumption here is that the peak intensities of reflected light in each lobe are primarily due to the optical depth structure and not absorption by intervening dust ( the equatorial waist ) .",
    "the observed peak of the west lobe is 3540% as bright as the east lobe in our @xmath13 and @xmath17 images , which corresponds to an inclination of @xmath37 .",
    "the observed normalized intensity profile of iras  07131@xmath00147 , obtained by summing a 10-pixel wide strip along the polar axis of our @xmath13 image , and the model profile ( for @xmath38 ) , is shown in fig .",
    "the central star is denoted by a dashed line , emphasizing the fact that the model does not account for the evolved , un - obscuring nature of the equatorial dust near the central star .",
    "the model nebulae only require that the equatorial dust be of higher density than the lobes ( @xcite ) .",
    "s90 find an inclination of zero from their optical polarization study @xmath0 outside our most conservative error estimate .",
    "the difference can be explained by precession of the fast wind , where in addition to rotation in the plane of the sky ( as seen in fig .",
    "2 ) , the fast wind has also rotated around the equatorial axis .",
    "our near - infrared images probe the inner regions of the nebula while optical data are sensitive to the outer lobe regions ( see polarization maps of s90 ) . in effect",
    ", we are looking at the geometry of dust shaped by a precessing wind at different times .",
    "the sense of precession is that of the fast wind in the east lobe rotating toward us and slightly to the north .",
    "a precession of 20 degrees in 5000 years corresponds to an angular velocity of approximately @xmath39 radians / year .",
    "if we follow this line of reasoning farther back in time , the east lobe may once have been the fainter lobe @xmath0 inclined away from us .",
    "observed now , the optical depth in the extreme outer regions of the lobes would be too small to scatter light and the wind - shaped cone at this original inclination would not be seen .",
    "however , the equatorial waist would still be tilted over the east lobe and away from the west lobe , thus reddening light that is preferentially scattered into the line - of - sight by the present day geometry of the inner region of the east lobe and explaining the observed lobe colors .",
    "the ridge - like brightening of the lobes several arcseconds away from the central star would likely be a geometric effect ; a result of the curving low - density polar cones and not a physical clumpiness in the dust .",
    "morris ( 1981 , 1987 ) proposed a binary star bipolar jet collimation mechanism which invokes a bound disk excreted from the red giant and a wind emanating from accretion onto the secondary .",
    "this model is capable of producing fast winds even for ppn with late type central stars .",
    "multi - dimensional hydrodynamic studies have shown that dust distributions consistent with the formation of bipolar reflection nebulae are an inevitable consequence of agb mass ejection in common envelope binary systems ( @xcite ) . in this scenario , the excretion of the disk results from a brief period of friction - induced `` spiraling - in '' during the common envelope evolution .",
    "accretion , and possibly jets , would follow this phase .",
    "the suggestion by livio ( 1993 ) that the secondary may retain high entropy material , expand adiabatically , and transfer material back onto the red giant could be responsible for increasing the mass of the hydrogen envelope over its critical value ( @xcite ) and postponing its blueward evolution though the ppn phase .",
    "the coupling of the orbital and rotational angular momenta of the stars in the system may cause the precession of the jets ( @xcite ) .",
    "recent 3-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of precessing jets in point - symmetric nebulae conclude that interacting binary systems are the most plausible jet production mechanism ( @xcite ) .",
    "the resolution of binary systems in several ppn through adaptive optics imaging ( @xcite ) lends some observational support to the binary mechanism .",
    "objects such as iras  07131@xmath00147 and iras  09371 + 1212 ( frosty leo ) , that display evidence of evolved bipolar nebular structure and late type ( unevolved ) central stars , are likely the typical examples of binary ppn .",
    "we believe the observational data now available for iras  07131@xmath00147 supports the binary mechanism of ppn formation .",
    "the optical and near - infrared images suggest an evolved ppn morphology where the central star is no longer obscured by its equatorial waist .",
    "the iras lrs also indicates an evolved nebular morphology , where the dust has expanded away from the central star and cooled . yet",
    "the central star is a late m giant , virtually unevolved through the ppn phase .",
    "we find striking evidence for the precession of the fast dust - shaping wind in this object .",
    "our near - infrared images reveal point symmetry in the inner lobe regions .",
    "furthermore , a comparison with the inclination derived from optical polarization data , sensitive to the outer lobe regions , and our infrared - derived inclination , sensitive to the inner lobe regions , suggests that the fast wind also precessed around the equatorial axis .",
    "this dynamic geometric interpretation is consistent with the observed lobe colors and the ridge - like brightening of the optical nebulosity several arcseconds away from the central star .",
    "no viable theory other than the binary mechanism has been proposed for the collimation or precession of a fast wind in ppn systems with late type central stars .",
    "the binary central star hypothesis could be tested in several ways .",
    "high signal to noise optical spectra of the reflection lobes could reveal a faint blue bump , emanating from the unseen binary companion .",
    "this was suggested by cohen et al .",
    "( 1985 ) to explain a blue bump in the lobe spectrum of the ppn , oh 0739@xmath014 ; the binary companion was later resolved by adaptive optics imaging ( @xcite ) . the @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 may be able to resolve a companion in iras  07131@xmath00147 .",
    "alternatively , if the binary system is eclipsing , a photometric monitoring campaign could confirm our hypothesis .",
