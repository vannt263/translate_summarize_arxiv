    "the globular cluster ( gc ) terzan 8 is one of the faintest gcs populating the outer halo . discovered by terzan ( 1968 ) , it is located at a distance of 19.4 kpc from the galactic center in the constellation of sagittarius ( @xmath2 ; harris 1996 , 2010 edition ) .",
    "the photometric studies of this gc ( ortolani & gratton 1990 ; montegriffo et al .",
    "1998 ) suggested that it is an old , metal - poor object with a blue horizontal branch ( hb ) .",
    "the first spectroscopic study of this cluster analysed 3 red giant stars in the caii triple region and derived a very low metallicity ( [ fe / h]=-2.3 ; da costa & armandroff 1985 ) .",
    "more recently , mottini , wallerstein & mcwilliam ( 2008 ) used high - resolution spectroscopy to determine abundances of fe , o , na , @xmath3- , fe - peak , and neutron - capture elements for 3 red giants .",
    "the small number of targets of the above studies did not allow a relevant analysis of the cluster kinematics .",
    "recently , we performed an high - resolution spectroscopic survey of this cluster ( carretta et al .",
    "2014 ) providing accurate radial velocities for 82 stars in the central region of the cluster and abundances of 16 members .    from the dynamical point of view , terzan 8 is the less concentrated gc of the milky way ( c=0.41 ) and it appears very extended ( with an half - light radius of 15.3 pc ; salinas et al .",
    "such a peculiar structure implies a half - mass relaxation time comparable with its age , suggesting that terzan 8 could be dynamically young .",
    "the interest for this cluster increased because of its probable association with the sagittarius dwarf galaxy ( ibata , gilmore & irwin 1994 ) .",
    "indeed , the location in the sky , radial velocity and distance of terzan 8 are consistent with that of this satellite galaxy ( da costa & armandroff 1995 ; dinescu et al . 2001 ; palma , majewski & johnston 2002 ; bellazzini et al . 2003 ; majewski et al .",
    "2004 ; carraro , zinn & moni bidin 2007 ) . in particular , n - body simulations indicate that terzan 8 could be immersed in the trailing arm of the sagittarius stream ( edelsohn & elmegreen 1997 ; law & majewski 2010 ) .",
    "moreover , the presence of the sagittarius stream has been detected as an overdensity of stars in a wide region surrounding this cluster ( giuffrida et al .",

    "a set of @xmath8 sec exposures have been obtained . unfortunately , because of the instrumental setup , the low metallicity and s / n , we could not measure radial velocities for 2 rgb and all hb stars .",
    "the observations were obtained in service mode under seeing conditions of @xmath9 .",
    "the spectra were reduced ( bias and flat - field corrected , 1d extracted , and wavelength calibrated ) using the eso pipeline .",
    "we applied sky subtraction and division by an observed early - type star ( uves ) , or a synthetic spectrum ( giraffe ) to correct for telluric features near the [ oi ] line using the iraf routine telluric .",
    "the latter correction was applied only to the uves and bright giraffe samples .",
    "we shifted all spectra according to their heliocentric velocity and combined the individual exposures .",
    "the uves final spectra have s / n in the range 45 - 80 while the giraffe spectra have s / n values ranging from 5 to 80 .",
    "the heliocentric radial velocities and their uncertainties were then measured on the combined spectra of 82 stars using the iraf task rvidlines .",

    "to study the structure and kinematics of terzan 8 we derived its overall velocity dispersion , its density profile and its luminosity function ( mf ) . as a first step , we selected a sample of bona fide cluster members on the basis of their locations in the cmd and their radial velocities .",
    "in particular , we considered only those stars with    * a location in the cmd within @xmath20 around the cluster rgb mean ridge line and a magnitude within @xmath21 ; * a radial velocity within 5@xmath22 from the mean systemic velocity .    according to the above cirteria we defined a sample of 48 members .",

    "da costa & armandroff ( 1995 ) reported an average radial velocity @xmath24 from the analysis of three stars .",
    "the star - to - star comparison with our catalog gives a perfect agreement and the difference in the average velocity is probably due to their very small sample .",
    "we can not compare our values with the study of mottini et al .",
    "( 2008 ) because they do not provide the radial velocities for their targets .",
    "the overall velocity dispersion has been calculated using the algorithm proposed by pryor & meylan ( 1993 ) , where the velocity dispersion is calculated as the quantity @xmath25 that maximizes the likelihood @xmath26}{2\\pi\\sigma_{v}\\delta_{i}^{2 } } dv'\\nonumber\\\\ & = & -\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i}\\left(\\frac{(v_{i}-\\bar{v})^{2}}{\\sigma_{v}^{2}+\\delta_{i}^{2}}+ln[2\\pi(\\sigma_{v}^{2}+\\delta_{i}^{2})]\\right ) \\label{sig_eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the velocity of the i - th star and its associated uncertainty .",

    "the model predicts a contamination of 3.7 stars at @xmath13 km / s .",
    "note that all the synthetic field stars in this velocity range are main sequence stars in the foreground of the cluster .",
    "unfortunately , the time coverage of our spectra does not allow to identify binaries from their velocity variation , so the only chance to distinguish them from cluster members and the field population is to use their chemistry .",

    "the comparison with the field milky way and sagittarius stars is less clear and is hampered by the large uncertainties in the derived abundances .",
    "however , we note that while the abundances of si and ca are consistent with those of both groups , the mean ti i and mg abundance are significantly lower than those of the galactic giants while still compatible with those of sagittarius ( @xmath36 ) below the mean locus of sgr stars . given the large involved uncertainties it is not clear whether this difference is real or due to measurement errors . ] .",
    "moreover , ba appears to be enhanced by @xmath37 in 4 of them , in agreement with what observed in sgr stars ( sbordone et al .",
    "even more important is the excellent agreement between the abundance of fe measured from the neutral and ionized lines in all the analysed stars . as stated in sect .",
    "[ obs_sec ] we adopted a gravity derived assuming these objects as rgb stars at the same distance of terzan 8 . were these stars foreground milky way dwarfs their gravity would be larger by @xmath38 . according to the sensibility reported in carretta et al .",
    "( 2014 ) this would produce a striking mismatch between the abundances of fe i and fe ii as a consequence of the wrong adopted ionization equilibrium . on the basis of the above considerations we conclude that at least 4 out these 7 stars are likely member of the sagittarius stream .",
    "we performed a detailed study of the structure and kinematics of the gc terzan 8 by means of a set of accurate radial velocities obtained through high - resolution spectroscopy in the inner part of the cluster .",
    "the cluster density profile is well fitted by very extended models with the largest half - mass radius among galactic gcs ( @xmath39 ) . by considering the estimated mass and the galactocentric distance of this gc we estimate an half mass - to - jacobi radii ratio of @xmath40 . in comparison with the other galactic gcs it situates in the upper branch of the @xmath41 diagram constituted by extended low - mass gcs ( baumgardt et al .",
    "the position of these clusters has been interpreted as a consequence of different cloud pressure and background tidal force at their formation ( elmegreen 2008 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that many of these clusters have been associated to merging dwarf galaxies .",
    "it is not clear if terzan 8 was born with such an extended structure or this is due to its dynamical evolution , although its long relaxation time suggests the former hypothesis . in this context , if terzan 8 spent most of its evolution within a dwarf galaxy ( like the sagittarius dsph ) it experienced a mild tidal field and could therefore form and evolve with a more extended structure with respect to other gcs formed within the milky way halo .",
    "this could explain also the small fraction of na - enhanced stars found in this cluster ( see carretta et al . 2014 ) .",
    "these stars are indeed expected to form in the central part of the cluster after some @xmath42 after the cluster formation being more resistant than the first stellar generation to the tidal stripping process ( dercole et al .",
    "2008 ; decressin et al .",
    "2007 ) . for this reason , while in gcs the first stellar generation generally constitute only a small fraction of the cluster content , in terzan 8 it is almost entirely retained in terzan 8 because of the mild tidal stress experienced by this cluster .",
    "we found no significant radial component of rotation within the cluster , although slow rotations ( with @xmath43 ) would not be detected by our study and can not therefore be excluded .",
    "the derived overall velocity dispersion appears to be larger than what predicted by dynamical models assuming kinetic energy equipartition and a moderate amount of binaries . on the other hand , models without equipartition",
    "can reproduce the observed velocity dispersion regardless of the adopted fraction of binaries .",
    "the half - mass relaxation times of the considered models are @xmath44 , shorter than the estimated cluster age ( @xmath45=12.2 gyr ; marn - franch et al .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that collisional effects have not altered the kinematics of this gc . by means of nbody simulations we estimated only a negligible contribution of tidal effects to the cluster velocity dispersion , at least when quasi - circular orbits are considered . in principle",
    ", highly eccentric orbits could produce a more significant inflation of the velocity dispersion even in the innermost regions of the clusters .",
    "such a hypothesis requires a specific study with extensive nbody simulations .",
    "the observed discrepancy could be eliminated if a large fraction ( @xmath46 ) of binaries is present within terzan 8 .",
    "unfortunately , the time coverage of our spectra does not allow to identify binaries from their velocity variation .",
    "an estimate of the binary fraction in this cluster has been provided by milone et al .",
    "( 2012 ) who found @xmath47 within the acs field of view .",
    "it is worth noting that the uncertainties in the adopted distribution of periods , eccentricity and mass - ratios of binaries affect the determination of the binary fraction through photometric and spectroscopic studies in different ways and can produce a mismatch between these two estimates .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the masses of the models have been calculated from the number counts on the cmd and can be therefore considered as an estimate of the luminous mass of this cluster .",
    "the large observed velocity dispersion could be viewed as an excess of dynamical mass within terzan 8 , as indicated by the large dynamical mass - to - light ratios @xmath48 . a systematic difference between the luminous and dynamical masses of many gcs",
    "have been already noticed by sollima et al .",
    "( 2012 ) who addressed the observed difference to the large uncertainties on the mf and the retention fraction of dark remnants . also in this case",
    ", different assumptions on the dark remnants could alleviate or even eliminate the difference between the observed and predicted velocity dispersion of this gc .",
    "we detected a sample of 7 stars with radial velocities in the range @xmath49 km / s apparently clustered around the systemic velocity of terzan 8 but with a spread significantly larger than the cluster velocity dispersion .",
    "these stars are spatially segregated with respect to the other field and cluster stars occupying the same half of the observed field of view .",
    "the probability that this occurs by chance is @xmath60.8% .",
    "the abundance analysis performed on these stars indicates that they have a metallicity which is inconsistent with that of the cluster .",
    "the abundance patterns of the @xmath3-elements and ba indicate a deficiency of mg and ti i and an overabundance of ba in these stars with respect to galactic field stars and more similar to those measured in sagittarius stars .",
    "moreover , the gravities estimated for these stars are consistent with a distance similar to that of terzan 8 . the comparison with the galactic model of robin et al .",
    "( 2003 ) indicates that it is unlikely that a significant number of galactic field stars could be present at such a large galactocentric distance .",
    "we therefore conclude that they are likely member of the sagittarius stream surrounding terzan 8 .",
    "the presence of the sagittarius stream has been already detected in some previous studies based on wide field photometric surveys ( giuffrida et al .",
    "2010 ; siegel et al . 2011 ; salinas et al .",
    "this however represents the first spectroscopic detection of sagittarius stars around this gc , confirming its belonging to the stream of this satellite galaxy .",
