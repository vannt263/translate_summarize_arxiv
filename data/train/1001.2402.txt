    "the cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm predicts the presence of numerous substructures in dark halos on any scale , because less massive objects form earlier and become more massive through mergers .",
    "indeed , high - resolution n - body simulations have shown an assemble history that subhalos continually fall into larger halos .",
    "when interior subhalos penetrate into a central region of a massive parent halo , subhalos are disrupted by its strong tidal field . as a result",
    ", the original subhalo mass is reduced by the tidal effect and becomes a part of smoothed component of the parent halo ( e.g de lucia et al .",
    "2004 ; gao et al .",
    "therefore , a study of subhalo properties is of vital importance to understand an assemble history in halo environments .",
    "furthermore , a statistical study for subhalos , such as mass function , would offer a powerful test of the cdm model on scales less than several mpc .    gravitational lensing analysis on background galaxies",
    "is the unique technique to map out mass distributions of any object , such as galaxies and clusters , regardless of the dynamical state .",
    "it therefore enables us to explore substructures in primary halos and to measure directly their masses .",
    "indeed , galaxy - galaxy lensing studies in clusters ( e.g. natarajan & springel 2004 ; natarajan , de lucia & springel 2007 ) revealed cluster substructures and measured their mass functions under the assumption of a scaling relation between mass and light . however , a technique requiring no assumption of mass - to - light relation is of paramount importance , because subhalo size in a strong tidal field depends on its orbit parameters as well .",
    "furthermore , we can not rule out a possibility that gaseous galaxies in a gaseous environment of galaxy clusters are offset from subhalo centers because of ram pressure .",
    "even a slight offset prevents us from measuring subhalo masses accurately , because a mis - centering of tangential distortion profile causes large error in mass estimations especially within inner regions ( e.g yang et al 2006 ; johnston et al .",
    "it is therefore of importance to explore subhalos and measure their masses based on a weak mass reconstruction technique independent of any mass - to - light scaling relations .",
    "as demonstrated by okabe & umetsu ( 2008 ) , a systematic weak lensing study on seven mering clusters in the range of @xmath7 is capable of discovering massive substructures associated with cluster major majors .",
    "however , the limit of angular resolution of reconstructed mass distributions , within the redshift range , makes it difficult to discover less massive substructures associated with cluster galaxies . on the other hand",
    ", it would be easier to detect less massive substructures in lower redshift clusters in spite of the weakness of their lensing signal , because the number of available source galaxies increases thanks to larger apparent size of objects at lower redshift .",
    "therefore , weak lensing study of low - redshift clusters will provides us with a good opportunity to detect and measure smaller subhalo masses in clusters .",
    "as the first step , we select coma cluster for the target to measure subhalo masses by weak lensing analysis alone . the redshift of coma cluster is 0.0236 and is known as one of the most massive clusters near us .",
    "we analyze archival subaru / suprime - cam data ( miyazaki et al .",
    "2002 ) to measure subhalo masses found in projected mass distributions as well as cluster virial mass , and calculate the mass fraction of substructures .",
    "we also investigate lensing from background large - scale structure ( lss ) in a quantitative way , using sdss multi - bands and photometric data .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "we briefly describe the data analysis in  [ sec : data ] and measure the three - dimensional mass enclosed within a spherical region of a given radius using a tangential shear profile in ",
    "[ sec : mass ] .",
    " [ sec : map ] represents projected distributions of mass and member galaxies , quantifies false lensing peaks and estimate background lensing effects on the weak lensing mass reconstruction . in ",
    "[ sec : submass ] , we measure the two - dimensional masses for subclumps with and without lss lensing correction . in  [ sec : stack ] , we fit a tangential shear profile over an ensemble of subclump candidates and obtain the typical truncated radius and mass of subhalos . ",
    "[ sec : dis ] is devoted to the discussion . throughout the paper",
    "we adopt cosmology parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 . at the redshift of coma cluster @xmath10 .",
    "we retrieved two @xmath11 image data ( yoshida et al .",
    "2008 ) from the subaru archival data ( smoka ) .",
    "pointings of imaging data are the central region of @xmath12 from cd galaxy ngc4874 and the outskirts region of @xmath13 .",
    "they cover the southwest part of this cluster .",
    "the data were reduced by the same imaging process of using standard pipeline reduction software for suprime - cam , sdfred @xcite , as described in okabe & umetsu ( 2008 ) .",
    "astrometry and the photometric calibration were conducted using the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data catalog .",
    "the exposure times are @xmath14 and @xmath15 minutes for the central and outskirt regions , respectively .",
    "our weak lensing analysis was done using the imcat package provided by n. kaiser(kaiser , squires & broadhurst 1995 ) .",
    "we use the same pipeline as okabe et al .",
    "( 2009 ) with some modifications followed by erben et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ( also see okabe & umetsu 2008 ) . in the pipeline ,",
    "we first measure the image ellipticity , @xmath16 , from the weighted quadrupole moments of the surface brightness of each object and then correct the psf anisotropy as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the smear polarizablity tensor and the asterisk denotes the stellar objects .",
    "we fit the stellar anisotropy kernel @xmath19 with the second - order bi - polynomials function in several subimages whose sizes are determined based on the typical coherent scale of the measured psf anisotropy pattern .",

    "we ran the pipeline for each imaging data and obtained the shear catalogue of source galaxies whose magnitude ranges are @xmath23 abmag and half - light - radius are @xmath24 pixel , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the mean and @xmath27 error for stellar objects , respectively . here",
    "the upper limit of magnitude is determined by the outskirt data of short exposure time , although faint galaxies in the range of @xmath28ab mag are usable in the data of central region . since apparent sizes of unlensed galaxies , mainly cluster members ,",
    "are large in general , our source galaxy selection efficiently excludes member galaxies which dilutes lensing strengths .",
    "the number density of source galaxies is @xmath29 .",
    "we measure a tangential shear component , @xmath30 and the @xmath31 degree rotated component , @xmath32 , with respect to the cluster center , where @xmath33 is the position angle in counter clockwise direction from the first coordinate .",
    "then , the profiles of shear components @xmath34 are obtained from the weighted azimuthal average of the distortion components of source galaxies as @xmath35 with a statistical weight @xmath36 , where subscripts n and i denote the n - th radial bin and i - th source object .",
    "we adopt the softening constant @xmath37 which is a typical value of the mean rms @xmath38 over source galaxies .",
    "there are two cd galaxies ( ngc 4874 and ngc 4889 ) in the central region of coma cluster .",
    "we adopt the center of coma cluster as ngc 4874 because a number of luminous galaxies are concentrated around ngc 4874 in our optical image , and the peak of x - ray surface brightness is close to ngc 4874 ( see also figure [ fig : xmm ] ) .",
    "the shear profile covers the range of @xmath39 with 5 bins .",
    "it corresponds to the first bin of kubo et al .",
    "we fit the shear profile with the universal profile proposed by navarro , frenk & white ( 1996 ; hereafter nfw profile ) and a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) halo model .",
    "we assume that the redshift of source background galaxies is @xmath40 .",
    "an uncertainty of source redshift in mass estimates is negligible because the lens distance ratio , @xmath41 , at such a low redshift cluster weakly depends on source redshifts .",
    "the nfw mass model is described by two parameters of the three - dimensional mass @xmath42 and the halo concentration @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is a scale radius and @xmath45 is a radius at which the mean density is @xmath46 times the critical mass density , @xmath47 , at the cluster redshift .",
    "the density profile of nfw mass model is expressed in the form of @xmath48 the three - dimensional cluster mass for nfw mass model is obtained by @xmath49 with @xmath50 for reference with other works , results of mass and concentration parameter within radii for @xmath51 & @xmath52 and virial overdensity @xmath53 ( nakamura & suto 1997 ) , are listed in table [ tab : mass ] . the density profile for sis mass model",
    "is given by @xmath54 where the one - dimensional velocity dispersion , @xmath55 , is a parameter .",
    "the resulting parameters are summarized in table [ tab : mass ] .",
    "since the covering area of the data is small @xmath56 , the nfw mass is not constrained well .",
    "this is why the mass @xmath57 determined by fitting the tangential shear is sensitive to the tangential distortion at @xmath45 ( okabe et al .",
    "2009 ) . since the best - fit virial radius is @xmath58 , we require data of wider region to measure the cluster mass accurately .",
    "we note that the @xmath59 is quite small because the number of background galaxies is scarce and the intrinsic ellipticity noise is large .",
    "the covering area of our data is only @xmath60 within @xmath61 .",
    "if the data covers whole area , the error would improve @xmath62 times and the @xmath59 would become close to @xmath63 . the nfw virial mass changes @xmath64 and @xmath65 if the mean source redshift is changed to @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively .",

    "recent hydrodynamic n - body simulations pointed out that x - ray mass estimates with an assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium are biased low due to icm turbulence , because the gas motion pressure of turbulence as well as bulk motions supports a part of the total pressure ( e.g. ervard et al .",

    "the fitting result gives the truncated radius @xmath87 , which coincides with galaxy - galaxy lensing results in clusters ( e.g. natarajan & springel 2004 ; natarajan , de lucia & springel 2007 ) .",
    "the truncated radius is much smaller than a truncated radius @xmath88 obtained by galaxy - galaxy lensing studies of fields ( e.g. hoekstra , yee & gladders 2004 ) .",
    "it would be due to the strong tidal field of the main cluster gravitational potential . the tidal radius of a subhalo orbiting in a spherically",

    "we found four subhalos and two cd galaxy halos in the central data ( @xmath12 ) and one halo in the outskirts data ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "there is a difference of the halo number for the radius , which might support the results of numerical simulation ( e.g de lucia et al .",
    "2004;gao et al 2004 ) that the number of substructure increases as the radius decreases . compensating the limitation of our data region , we roughly estimate the number of subhalos within the radii @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "if we assume that there are four ( @xmath12 ) and one ( @xmath94 ) subhalos in the area corresponding to our data , the halo number is estimated to be @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the area of our data .",

    "a galaxy - galaxy lensing study ( natarajan , de lucia & springel 2007 ) indicates that @xmath105 of the mass is contained in cluster substructures , which also roughly agrees with our result .",
    "our weak lensing analysis on the nearby cluster would indicate the possibility that the mass function of cluster substructures is measurable without assumptions of mass - to - light ratio for member galaxies and dynamical state , while the galaxy - galaxy lensing studies ( e.g. natarajan & springel 2004 ; natarajan , de lucia & springel 2007 ) requires the assumption of the mass and light scaling law .",
    "we however have not yet obtained the mass spectrum as the galaxy - galaxy lensing studies ( e.g. natarajan & springel 2004 ; natarajan , de lucia & springel 2007 ) .",
    "alternative possible approach to investigate the mass function of cluster substructures is to measure higher order moments of the lensed images ( holics ) and using the moments to estimate the flexion ( e.g. okura et al .",
    "2007 ; okura & futamase 2008 ; okura et al . 2008 ) .",
    "they have shown for the first time that flexion analysis can discover substructures using the image of a1689 ( okura et al .",
    "2007 ) .    as pointed out by shaw et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , the median mass fraction is a increase function of the virial mass ( @xmath106 ) , because massive objects , which formed more recently than less massive objects , have less time to disrupt subhalos ( zenter et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the statistical study of mass fraction of galaxy clusters is , therefore , one of good tests of @xmath107cdm and the hierarchical clustering , as the concentration - mass relation of the nfw mass model ( okabe et al .",
    "hence , further systematic study of mass fractions is required .",
    "the area of our current data is insufficient to derive the halo mass function as well as to measure cluster mass accurately .",
    "the next instrument of a prime focus camera of subaru telescope , hyper - suprime - cam , whose field - of - view is @xmath108 , will efficiently observe the nearby cluster and enables us to conduct weak lensing and flexion analyses .",
    "our result using the subaru / suprime - cam does guarantee that weak lensing analysis using subaru / suprime - cam and hyper - suprime - cam is capable for almost x - ray clusters .",
