    "<S> these transitions are driven by thermal fluctuations from the reservoir , and are coupled to the bits and to the mass in a manner described in detail below . </S>",
    "<S> the model has three parameters : @xmath1 describes the initial statistical state of the bits , reflecting the initial ratio of 0 s to 1 s ; @xmath2 characterizes the weight of the mass ; and @xmath3 is the duration of interaction with each bit in the stream . for any set of values @xmath4 </S>",
    "<S> the model reaches a unique periodic steady state , characterized by an average rate of work performed on the mass , and an average rate of information written to the bit stream .    </S>",

    "<S> moreover , our demon is versatile : it is equally capable of acting as an eraser , using the energy of a falling mass to remove information from the memory register .    </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : phasediagram ] for @xmath109 and @xmath110 . </S>",
    "<S> the line @xmath111 is the contour of zero steady - state rotation : to the left of this line the rotation is ccw ( @xmath112 and to the right it is cw ( @xmath107 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the product @xmath113 represents the average work that the device delivers to the mass , per interaction interval . since @xmath114 , the two lightly shaded triangles in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phasediagram ] ( @xmath115 ) are the regions in which the device acts as an _ engine _ , converting heat from the thermal bath into work to lift the mass . </S>",
    "<S> for example , when @xmath116 gravity exerts a ccw torque , but the excess of incoming 0 s generates a greater cw torque .    </S>",

    "<S> @xmath118 quantifies the information content of the incoming stream , and is related to its capacity to record new information , in the following sense . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath119 the incoming stream is a blank slate composed entirely of 0 s ( or entirely of 1 s ) , and the outgoing stream contains a faithful record of cw ( or ccw ) rotations , as discussed earlier . when @xmath120 ( its maximum possible value ) the incoming stream is saturated with an equal mixture of 0 s and 1 s , and in this case the outgoing stream does not chronicle the demon s rotations . </S>",
    "<S> we will interpret the difference @xmath121 as a measure of the degree to which new information is written to the bits , as they interact with the demon .    since the rotation of the demon couples tightly to the flipping of bits ( eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : deltachi ] ) , the line @xmath111 ( where @xmath95 ) is a contour along which @xmath122 ; here , there is no net rotation and no net change in the bit statistics : @xmath123 and @xmath124 . the other solid line depicted in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> we see in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phasediagram ] that @xmath132 whenever our device acts as an engine . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the proposition that a mechanical demon , in order to convert heat to work , must write information to a memory register . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phasediagram ] shows that the greater the storage capacity of the incoming bit stream , the larger the mass the demon can hoist against gravity : when presented with a blank slate ( @xmath133 ) the demon can lift any mass ; but when the incoming bit stream is saturated ( @xmath134 ) the demon is incapable of delivering work . </S>",
    "<S> thus a blank or partially blank memory register acts as a thermodynamic resource that gets consumed when the demon acts as an engine .    in the above description </S>",
    "<S> , the demon is an active rectifying agent and the bit stream merely a passive receptacle for information . from another perspective </S>",
    "<S> , however , the interaction with the demon presents an opportunity for the bits to evolve to a more disordered sequence of 0 s and 1 s . </S>",
    "<S> the bits role then appears more assertive : their evolution toward greater randomness is what drives the engine , and the demon simply facilitates the process .    in the darkly shaded regions in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phasediagram ] , the demon acts as an _ eraser _ , removing information from the memory register : @xmath135 . for example , if @xmath134 , @xmath136 ( i.e.  @xmath137 ) and @xmath63 , then the bits arrive in an equal mixture of 0 s and 1 s , but each bit has sufficient time to equilibrate with the demon , hence at the end of each interaction interval the composite system is almost certainly in state @xmath11 , @xmath12 or @xmath13 ( eq .  [ eq : equilibrium ] ) . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the outgoing bits are nearly all 0 s , and the memory is effectively wiped clean as the mass drops by a distance @xmath138 ( on average ) per interaction interval .    </S>",
    "<S> our model thus reflects the interplay between two effective forces , one associated with the randomization of the bits and the other with the pull of gravity . </S>",
    "<S> when our model acts as an engine , it consumes one resource  a blank or partially blank memory register  to build up another : the gravitational potential of the mass . </S>",
    "<S> when it acts as an eraser the roles are reversed . in the unshaded regions in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phasediagram ] , both resources are squandered ( the mass falls and the bits disorder increases ) and our model is a dud , accomplishing nothing useful .    </S>",
    "<S> our model satisfies the inequality @xmath139 for any @xmath2 , @xmath1 and @xmath3 , with the equality holding only when @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> ( see supplementary material . ) </S>",
    "<S> thus , the increase in the information content of the bit stream places an upper limit on the work that can be delivered , when the model is an engine . </S>",
    "<S> analogous inequalities arise in the context of feedback control , where an external agent manipulates the system on the basis of outcomes of explicit measurements  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when our model acts an eraser ( @xmath135 ) , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : ineq ] reveals the minimum amount of work that must be _ supplied _ </S>",
    "<S> , by the falling mass , in order to reduce the information content by a given amount . in the case of full erasure ( @xmath140 ) </S>",
    "<S> this becomes landauer s principle , @xmath141 . </S>",
    "<S> note that if we are willing to assign thermodynamic meaning to the randomness in a string of data , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : ineq ] can be interpreted as the second law of thermodynamics ( or rather as a weak statement of it , since @xmath142 ignores correlations between outgoing bits ) : the decrease in the entropy of the reservoir , @xmath143 , must not exceed the increase in the entropy of the bit stream : @xmath144    while both sides of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : ineq ] approach zero as @xmath145 , their ratio approaches unity in that limit ( see supplementary material ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus in the immediate vicinity of the line @xmath111 , the bound represented by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : ineq ] becomes saturated , and our model behaves with maximal efficiency , acting as a thermodynamically _ reversible _ engine or eraser . </S>",
    "<S> note however that the _ rate _ at which the demon either delivers work or erases information approaches zero in this reversible limit .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude by mentioning two extensions of the present work . </S>",
    "<S> first , we can reformulate our model as one in which the bits arrive as a sequence of matched pairs , or _ dimers _ </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath146 ( e.g.  @xmath147 ) , and the demon interacts with the bit stream , one dimer at a time . </S>",
    "<S> even if the incoming stream contains an equal proportion of 0 s and 1 s , the demon is able to lift the mass , effectively by `` digesting '' the pairwise correlations between the bits , which depart in a less ordered sequence ( e.g.  @xmath148 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests the possibility of a more complex information - processing engine , driven by the recognition of specific patterns in the bit stream .    we have also sketched a mechanistic version of our model , composed of frictionless paddles , pulleys and axles immersed in a dilute gas . </S>",
    "<S> while highly idealized , this model is more easily visualized as a material physical system than the discrete - state model described in the present paper . </S>",
    "<S> see ref .  </S>",
