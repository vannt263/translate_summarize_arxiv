    "we now can search for the value of @xmath66 that provides the best match between two structure functions .",

    "[ fig : sf ] .",
    "the best match is found for @xmath67 , adopting @xmath68  pc , implying that the outburst happened @xmath69  yr ago .",
    "another immediate conclusion is that bright clouds are located @xmath70  pc further away than sgr  a@xmath6 .    within @xmath71",
    "pc from sgr  a@xmath6 ( in projection ) there are two prominent molecular structures , the so - called 50  @xmath72 and 20  @xmath72 clouds .",
    "there is no evidence for bright reflected emission from these clouds in the chandra and xmm - newton data .",
    "@xcite suggested that these clouds are located within @xmath73  pc , but on the opposite sides ( along the line - of - sight ) from sgr  a@xmath6 . since for a closer vicinity of sgr  a@xmath6 the locus of illuminated gas",
    "is located at @xmath74  pc , the flare scenario predicts that by now both clouds are not illuminated ",
    "consistent with x - ray data .",
    "the 50  @xmath75 could have been bright @xmath76yr ago ( if located at @xmath77pc ) or even earlier .",

    "the corresponding range of the @xmath79 is @xmath0120 - 95  yr . on the other hand , for a broader range of values , e.g. , @xmath80 or 1 , there is a clear mismatch between the manipulated structure functions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ex ] ) .",
    "the above calculations were done assuming that the duration of the outburst @xmath81 is infinitely small .",
    "one gets constraints on @xmath81 directly from the structure functions , since at small separations in time the function @xmath82 should drop compared to @xmath83 .",
    "however the difference between @xmath82 and @xmath83 will only be prominent if the duration of the outburst is significantly longer than the light propagation time of a typical cloud along the line of sight , i.e. , @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the characteristic size of the cloud .",
    "in addition , the finite angular resolution of the xmm - newton is expected to introduce by itself a drop of the @xmath83 at small separations .",
    "if we assume an effective angular resolution of @xmath86 , it translates into @xmath87  pc in space , or @xmath88  yr in time ( assuming @xmath89 ) . from fig .",
    "[ fig : sf ] there is no evidence for a strong decline of @xmath90 w.r.t . @xmath25 .",
    "this suggests that the duration was shorter than a few years .",
    "one can corroborate this conclusion by examining light curves of a few variable bright spots in the reflected emission maps ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : xvar ] ) .",
    "the light curves have been extracted from three regions .",
    "regions 1 and 2 are located within the part of the sgr  a molecular complex that is bright in the reflected emission , while region 3 is a test region where reflected emission is faint .",
    "corresponding light curves are shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : xvar ] .",
    "red and black points correspond to xmm - newton and chandra observations , respectively .",
    "the flux is clearly variable with a peak in 2009 - 2010 .",
    "the duration of the peaks sets an upper limit on the duration of the outburst .",
    "even for an extremely short outburst the finite spatial extent of each cloud along the line of sight broadens the peak in the light - curves .",
    "for instance , for a cloud with the size of 1  pc , the minimum duration of the observed outburst , given @xmath91 is 4.3  yr . based on this analysis , we have concluded that the assumption of a short outburst [ shorter than a few years ; see also ] is reasonable .",
    "the mean surface brightness of the reflected component in the analysed region ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ab ] ) is @xmath92 in the 5 - 8 kev band . from this value ( assuming fiducial parameters derived in the previous section and isotropic reflected emission ) we can immediately estimate the total fluence @xmath93 of the primary source during the outburst @xmath94 where @xmath3 is the mean gas density within the illuminated region in units of @xmath95 .",
    "the fluence in the 1 - 100  kev band was recalculated from the measured 5 - 8 kev flux assuming a photon index of 1.8 , as estimated from integral observations of the sgr b2 cloud .",
    "corresponding conversion factor is @xmath96 . for a photon index of 2",
    "( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) this factor is @xmath09.8 . a fiducial value @xmath97 used in eq .",
    "( [ eq : flu ] ) was motivated by the well studied sgr  b2 complex , where @xmath95 gas dominates the total mass budget on scales of tens of pc .",
    "the size of the region studied here ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ab ] ) is @xmath98  pc .",
    "thus it seems reasonable to use the same fiducial value of density as in sgr  b2 .",
    "the surface brightness in the studied region varies by a factor 10 ( lower limit if small - scale substructure is present ) .",
    "given our fiducial value of mean density , the brightest regions would correspond to local densities @xmath99 .",
    "the luminosity , corresponding to the estimated fluence is @xmath100 note that in the _ nustar _ study of the same region , @xcite suggested a much weaker limit on the sgr  a@xmath6 luminosity @xmath101 in the 2 - 20 kev band .",
    "apart from the factor of @xmath14 difference due to narrower energy band , the remaining difference is due to ( i ) the way the density / optical depth is defined and ( ii ) the assumed outburst duration . in @xcite the column density @xmath102 of the reflected gas was estimated from the spectral modelling . for our fiducial value of @xmath103 and assumed duration of @xmath1041  yr , the required density is @xmath105 .",
    "the column density measurements from the spectra rely on the spectral distortions introduced by photoelectric absorption . however ,",
    "if only a part of the cloud is illuminated , as it is the case when the flare is very short , the spectrally - derived column density corresponds to the characteristic column density of the entire cloud , rather than the column density of the illuminated gas . we therefore conclude that in the case of a short flare the column density ( or mean density ) that enters the conversion from the surface brightness to the luminosity of the primary source [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : lum ] ) ] does not necessarily coincide with the spectrally - determined column density .",
    "we therefore keep our scaling ( via @xmath3 ) in all subsequent estimates , but acknowledge that this value is uncertain by @xmath0 one order of magnitude .",
    "based on chandra observations of molecular clouds ( similar region to the one studied here ) , suggested that apart from a short ( @xmath02  yr long ) flare that dominates the variability of some clouds , additional flares are responsible for the illumination of other clouds .",
    "this conclusion is primarily based on the comparison of the maximal fluxes from a set of clouds and the peak antenna temperatures in the cs and n@xmath106h@xmath107 lines for the same clouds .",
    "found that the ratio of the x - ray and line fluxes differ among five clouds by a factor of @xmath06 .",
    "we believe that the uncertainties in association of x - ray peaks with the peaks from the position velocity cubes and conversion of molecular line fluxes to gas densities / column densities are large enough to allow for a single outburst scenario .",
    "we therefore keep the assumption of a single and short flare for the rest of the paper since it leads to the simplest picture .",
    "we note in passing that the structure functions can be explicitly expressed through the convolution of the gas density distribution power spectrum and the power spectrum of the flare .",
    "a short flare model , used here , has the advantage that most of the calculations are reduced to simple algebraic manipulations .",
    "the minimal accreted mass , assuming high radiative efficiency at level of 10% , is @xmath108 , where @xmath109 and @xmath110 are jupiter and earth masses , respectively .",
    "thus , this is a rather small value that can be easily provided by a tidal disruption ( tde ) of a planet , or capture of the gas cloud similar to the one found by @xcite .",
    "a scenario with a jupiter - mass planet has been already considered in application to the past sgr  a@xmath6 activity by @xcite , but the predicted duration of a flare in this case is likely @xmath111 yrs , while the actual frequency of such events is highly uncertain .    in order to produce a shorter flare one needs to disrupt a more massive body ( having higher escape velocity ) , i.e. a super - jupiter planet or a star .",
    "the rate of `` canonical '' stellar tdes is estimated at level @xmath112 per galaxy @xcite , while the peak luminosity of an associated flare can be as high as the eddington limit for the smbh @xcite .",
    "however , the bulk of this radiation is likely to be in extreme uv and soft x - ray energy bands@xcite , while hard x - ray emission is expected to originate from either a relativistic jet @xcite or a corona of hot electrons . in the former case",
    ", the hard x - ray emission should be beamed in the jet s direction .",
    "therefore , if viewed off - axis , the source can appear significantly dimmer . in the latter case",
    ", hard x - ray emission would also be rather dim due to the small optical thickness of the corona .",
    "both of these opportunities still imply that the hard x - ray emission constitutes only a minor fraction of the event s total energy output , and therefore some manifestations of its major contributor ( i.e. soft x - ray emission , beamed x - ray emission or kinetic power of the jets ) should be present ( e.g. signatures of severe x - ray heating of the gas or jet - driven shocks ) .",
    "still , some recent studies predict that a much smaller total radiative output might be more typical for tdes @xcite , as a result of inefficient circularization of bound debris of the disrupted star .",
    "all these scenarios remain speculative , given the uncertain , but in general low frequency of tdes ( see however * ? ? ?",
    "* for discussion of a phenomenological model , extrapolating the sgr  a@xmath6 flaring activity to rare , but very bright events ) .    if sgr  b2 is exposed to the same outburst , than it is located at @xmath113  pc ( closer to us than sgr  a@xmath6 ) , and the velocity of the flare propagation along the line of sight is @xmath114 ( for our fiducial parameters ) .",
    "the position estimate coincides with the value derived by @xcite based on the assumption that sgr  b2 is on the low eccentricity orbit around the galactic center . while the equality of two estimates is of course a coincidence , given the assumption and uncertainties , it is tempting to further examine this scenario .",
    "firstly , one can consider this result as a confirmation that sgr  b2 is on the low eccentricity orbit .",
    "secondly , we can directly compare the gas densities in the sgr  b2 cloud ( and in any other cloud ) relative to the sgr  a complex .",
    "the surface brightness of the reflected emission power by a short outburst is @xmath115 \\left[x^2+z^2 \\right]^{-1 } ,    \\label{eq : ix}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is related to @xmath45 and @xmath79 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : z ] ) . compared to the sgr  a complex , the decrease of the surface brightness due to @xmath116 term",
    "is partly compensated by the larger @xmath60 term ( @xmath117 for sgr  b2 compared to @xmath118 for the sgr  a complex ) . during recent years , ( e.g. , 2012 observations of xmm - newton ) , the mean surface brightness of the sgr  b2 region in the reflected emission was @xmath119 times lower than the mean surface brightness in the sgr  a complex ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ab ] ) , which is consistent with the predictions . during earlier observations , e.g. , before 2002 , the two molecular complexes were almost equally bright , but this can be readily explained in the single - flare scenario if during these observations a denser part of the sgr  b2 complex was illuminated . yet another constraint could come from the duration of the period when sgr  b2 was bright  at least for 24 years ( from 1993 to 2015 ) .",
    "given that our fiducial value of @xmath120 , this requires a size of @xmath121  pc along the line of sight .",
    "this is consistent with the size of the sgr  b2 cloud which according to is @xmath122  pc .",
    "the best verification of the short flare scenario could come from the comparison of light curves from several compact cores in two molecular complexes at different projected distances from sgr  a@xmath6 ( e.g. , sgr  b2 vs sgr  a complexes ) - the shapes of the light curves should be similar once a correction on the factor @xmath123 is made .",
    "another possibility is to use the difference between the spatial structure functions in the radial and tangential directions [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : sfrel ] ) ] .",
    "we illustrate this type of diagnostics in fig .",
    "[ fig : xy ] .",
    "the figure shows that when spherical clouds are illuminated by a short flare , they appear flattened in radial direction ( reminiscent of weak lensing image distortions ) .",
    "the magnitude of this effect increases with the projected distance .",
    "thus , such distortions ( after averaging over many clouds ) could be used to infer the position of the primary source [ perpendicular to the squeezed direction ] and the inclination of the paraboloid with respect to the picture plane [ from the magnitude of distortions ] . as discussed in the previous section ,",
    "the inclination is a proxy for the time of the outburst .",
    "one can also use the same approach to determine the duration of the flare - when the entire volume of a small cloud ( smaller , than @xmath124 ) is illuminated by the flare , the cloud should not appear as `` squeezed '' in radial direction , while larger clouds should .    recently ,",
    "several plausible models of the 3d distribution of molecular gas in the gc region have been suggested ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in these models",
    "a significant fraction of molecular gas is attributed to close or open orbits in the gc potential .",
    "one can use x - ray data to verify and calibrate these models .",
    "we simulate the expected reflected signal based on these models in another paper @xcite . here",
    ", we only note that in the most plausible model of @xcite the orbit passes some 50  pc behind sgr  a@xmath6 .",
    "this implies that the reflected emission that we see in x - rays today is not associated with the clouds on this orbit .",
    "if an additional significant mass is indeed present along this part of the orbit , then the reflected signal from the same outburst should be seen hundreds of years later .    in this study , we have made a number of simplifying assumptions . some of these simplifications can be avoided , but some are more fundamental . among the latter is the assumption that the power spectrum of gas density fluctuations is isotropic . in reality , clouds might be preferentially stretched or squeezed in radial or tangential directions . a related problem is the finite number of clouds and/or strong correlation between the distribution of clouds in 3d .",
    "most of the other simplifications can be avoided by doing more elaborate modelling based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : i ] ) that we defer to future work . a great deal of uncertainties can be removed by doing further observations .",
    "for instance , sufficiently long and regularly spaced in time ( a few months ) chandra and xmm - newton observations ( preferably by the same telescope / detector configuration ) would allow to measure the structure functions on small scales to better constrain the duration of the outburst and spatial structure function of illuminated clouds .",
    "particularly powerful diagnostics would be possible with the detection of localized and transient spikes in the surface brightness , corresponding to small and dense cores of molecular clouds .",
    "even more interesting would to associate localized peaks in x - rays with maser sources , for which parallax measurements allow independent distance estimates .",
    "another extremely interesting possibility , is to use future polarimetric observations that can provide a direct measurement of the primary source position in the picture plane ( from the polarization angle ) and 3d position of the cloud ( from the degree of polarization ) . for our fiducial parameters the scattering angle is @xmath125for the bright part of the sgr  a complex , and",
    "the expected degree of polarization is close to 60% .",
    "the observed reflected flux from the entire ellipse ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ab ] ) is @xmath126 in the 5 - 8 kev band . even taking into account that i ) fluorescent line emission is not polarized and ii ) thermal plasma emission typically contributes about half of the observed flux , it should be possible to detect polarization using future imaging polarimeters , e.g. xipe @xcite or ixpe @xcite .",
    "the degree of polarization would be a solid proxy for the scattering angle .",
    "the same degree of polarization is expected for scattering by an angle @xmath32 and @xmath127 . in reality , scattering smaller than 90implies that the outburst happened less than @xmath128  yr ago .",
    "even smaller angles can be effectively excluded , since it is unlikely that a powerful outburst from sgr  a@xmath6 was missed by observers .",
    "therefore , this ambiguity can be resolved .",
    "the scenario described above opens an exciting perspective for accurate mapping of the molecular gas density in the gc region , once the fluence of the flare is reliably calibrated .",
    "indeed , unlike any other method , the conversion factor from the surface brightness of reflected emission to the gas density is uncertain by a factor @xmath02 at most , due to the uncertainty in the iron abundance .",
    "all other gas properties like temperature , ionization state ( as long as iron is not strongly ionized ) , molecular , atomic or dust grain phases do not make any significant difference to the conversion factor . an ambitious program of regular observations for * a few hundred !",
    "* years would effectively provide a full 3d picture of the molecular gas distribution over the entire 100  pc region .",
    "a `` preview '' ( @xmath03.4  pc thick ) of a 3d gas distribution based on xmm - newton observations is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3d ] .",
    "moreover , once x - ray calorimeter data become available with future observatories ( like athena , x - ray surveyor ) , this 3d mapping can be supplemented with gas velocity measurements unambiguously linking position - velocity data from molecular line observations with the 3d positions from x - ray data .",
    "x - ray observations of the galactic center molecular clouds can serve as a powerful diagnostic tool for the 3d geometry of molecular gas and the past history of the sgr  a@xmath6 activity .",
    "we used the comparison of spatial and temporal variations of the reflected emission flux to conclude that @xmath0110  yr ago our supermassive black hole had a luminosity of the order of @xmath129 over a period no longer than a few years .",
    "this conclusion implies that a molecular complex , currently exposed to sgr  a@xmath6 radiation at @xmath130  pc from the source ( in projection ) , is located @xmath98  pc further away than sgr  a@xmath6 along the line of sight .",
    "we argue that these estimates can be further improved by future imaging and polarimetric observations . if there were only one or a few outbursts of sgr  a@xmath6 , then it would eventually be possible to make a full 3d distribution of the molecular gas in the gc region .",

    "<S> a powerful outburst of x - ray radiation from the supermassive black hole sgr  a * at the center of the milky way is believed to be responsible for the illumination of molecular clouds in the central @xmath0100 pc of the galaxy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the reflected / reprocessed radiation comes to us with a delay corresponding to the light propagation time that depends on the 3d position of molecular clouds with respect to sgr  a*. we suggest a novel way of determining the age of the outburst and positions of the clouds by studying characteristic imprints left by the outburst in the spatial and time variations of the reflected emission . </S>",
    "<S> we estimated the age of the outburst that illuminates the sgr  a molecular complex to be @xmath1 yr . </S>",
    "<S> this estimate implies that we see the gas located @xmath010 pc further away from us than sgr  a*. if the sgr  b2 complex is also illuminated by the same outburst , then it is located @xmath0130 pc closer than our galactic center . </S>",
    "<S> the outburst was short ( less than a few years ) and the total amount of emitted energy in x - rays is @xmath2  erg , where @xmath3 is the mean hydrogen density of the cloud complex in units of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> energetically , such fluence can be provided by a partial tidal disruption event or even by a capture of a planet . </S>",
    "<S> further progress in more accurate positioning and timing of the outburst should be possible with future x - ray polarimetric observations and long - term systematic observations with chandra and xmm - newton . </S>",
    "<S> a few hundred - years long x - ray observations would provide a detailed 3d map of the gas density distribution in the central @xmath5  pc region .    </S>",
