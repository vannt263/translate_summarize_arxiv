    "this paper continues to develop the line of ideas in @xcite , which are all motivated by the mzard - parisi formula for the free energy in the diluted spin glass models originating in @xcite .",
    "this formula is closely related to the original parisi formula @xcite for the free energy in the sherrington - kirkpatrick model @xcite , but at the same time it is more complicated , because it involves a more complicated functional order parameter that encodes some very special structure of the distribution of all spins ( or all multi - overlaps ) rather than the distribution of the overlaps .",
    "an important progress was made by franz and leone in @xcite , who showed that the mzard - parisi formula gives an upper bound on the free energy ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the technical details of their work are very different but , clearly , inspired by the analogous earlier result of guerra @xcite for the sherrington - kirkpatrick model , which lead the to the first proof of the parisi formula by talagrand in @xcite .",
    "another proof of the parisi formula was given later in @xcite , based on the ultrametricity property for the overlaps proved in @xcite using the ghirlanda - guerra identities @xcite ( the general idea that stability properties , such as the aizenman - contucci stochastic stability @xcite or the ghirlanda - guerra identities , could imply ultrametricity is due to arguin and aizenman , @xcite ) .",
    "the proof there combined the cavity method in the form of the aizenman - sims - starr representation @xcite with the description of the asymptotic structure of the overlap distribution that follows from ultrametricity and the ghirlanda - guerra identities @xcite .",
    "the mzard - parisi ansatz in the diluted models builds upon the ultrametric parisi ansatz in the sk model , so it is very convenient that ultrametricity for the overlaps can be obtained just as easily in the diluted models as in the sk model , simply because the ghirlanda - guerra identities can be proved in these models in exactly the same way , by using a small perturbation of the hamiltonian of the mixed @xmath1-spin type .",
    "however , as we mention above , the mzard - parisi ansatz describes the structure of the gibbs measure in these models in much more detail , as we shall see below .    some progress toward explaining the features of this ansatz beyond ultrametricity was made in @xcite , where the so - called hierarchical exchangeability of the pure states and the corresponding aldous - hoover representation were proved .",
    "this representation looks very similar to what one expects in the mzard - parisi ansatz , but lacks some additional symmetry .",
    "one example where this additional symmetry can be proved rigorously was given in @xcite for the @xmath2-rsb asymptotic gibbs measures in the diluted @xmath0-spin model , where it was obtained as a consequence of the cavity equations for spin distributions developed rigorously in @xcite .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is to show how this result can be extended to all finite - rsb asymptotic gibbs measures for all diluted models .",
    "namely , we will show that one can slightly modify the hamiltonian in such a way that all finite - rsb asymptotic gibbs measures satisfy the mzard - parisi ansatz as a consequence of the ghirlanda - guerra identities and the cavity equations .",
    "before we can state our main results , we will need to introduce necessary notations and definitions , as well as review a number of previous results .",

    "the main goal for us would be to compute the limit of the free energy @xmath22 as @xmath23 goes to infinity .",
    "the formula for this limit originates in the work of mzard and parisi in @xcite .",
