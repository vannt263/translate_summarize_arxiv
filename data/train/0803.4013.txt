    "analogously the klein - gordon equation can be derived directly from the relativistic relationship ( [ ec ] ) .    actually , in 1928 , ( the same year of the dirac s exceptional achievement ) breit @xcite provided the lacking correspondent principle , recalling that another way of writing eq .",

    "@xmath63 describes the rate of ticking of particle s clock with respect that of the reference frame clock @xcite .",
    "( [ h_br ] ) can thus be written as @xmath65 we show that the relativistic linear transformations , acting on the space of velocities rather than on coordinates , display some relevant advanteges as compared to the homogenous lorentz group : ( i ) they are able to describe the spin additional degree of freedom of a pointlike particle yet at a classical relativistic level ; ( ii ) they form a compact group hence with unitary finite - dimensional representations ; ( iii ) they describe antiparticles at a classical level as a direct consequence of rotation symmetry .",
    "in addition we show that these linear transformations , acting on rates of change with respect to the time coordinate @xmath56 of the reference frame , attribute to the latter a special role as required by quantum mechanics .",
    "hence the proposed symmetry group holds promise for a better reconciliation between relativity and quantum mechanics .",
    "the velocity of the particle and particle - time speed satisfy the following relationship , @xmath66 independently of the inertial reference frame .",

    "the kinematics of a relativisitc pointlike particle can be easily understood in terms of these variables .",
    "( [ epstein ] ) can be viewed as the norm of a unit 2d vector , which for later convenience we express as a 3d unit vector lying on the @xmath68 plane : @xmath69 .",

    "if the particle is at rest with respect to the reference frame , the vector lies on the @xmath70 axis ( @xmath71 ) moreover @xmath63 decreases with particle - speed increasing in the way predicted by special relativity ( time dilation ) .",
    "the unit vector @xmath72 , besides @xmath73 , is able only to describe the signed modulus of the particle velocity @xmath74 .",
    "the particle velocity is actually a 3d vector and the direction of @xmath57 can be accounted for by one additional 3d unit vector @xmath75 providing just the direction of @xmath57 .",
    "hence the motion state of a particle can be described by a specific couple of unit vectors @xmath72 and @xmath75 : @xmath76 within this approach changes of the particle velocity respect to an inertial frame can be accounted for by rotations of @xmath72 in the kinematic plane ( changes of the modulus ) and rotations of @xmath75 ( changes of the direction ) .",
    "@xmath75 can be transformed according to arbitrary 3d rotations around an arbitrary 3d unit vector @xmath77 .",

    "@xmath72 also describes kinematic states in the second and third quadrant with @xmath82 .",
    "these states provide a classical description of antiparticles .",
    "this point will appear more evident after quantization .",
    "from the point of view of classical ( not quantum ) special relativity , the description in terms of @xmath75 and @xmath72 appears to be redundant : a given velocity is described by two different states .",
    "for example a given velocity along direction @xmath83 can be described by the unit vectors @xmath84 and @xmath85 with @xmath86 , or equivalently by the unit vectors @xmath87 and @xmath88 with @xmath89 .",
    "thus a given physical velocity and the corresponding proper - time speed are described by two states .",
    "this twofold degeneracy recalls quantum spin , which pauli described in his paper on the exclusion principle @xcite as a _ classical nondescribable two - valuedness_. this two - valuedness can be described in terms of the helicity variable @xmath90 . in the following",
    "we will demonstrate that this classical twofold degeneracy is the classical correspondent of the helicty states determined by quantum spin .",
    "it is worth pointing out that , although the present approach describes a spin - like degree of freedom yet at a classical level , the interaction of a classical particle with the electromagnetic field does not appear to be affected by this additional degree of freedom , in contrast to what happens after quantization .",
    "figure  2 provides a clear geometric interpretation of the different kind of kinematic states : the first quadrant contains spin up particles , the second one spin up antiparticles , the third spin down antiparticles and the fourth quadrant spin down particles .",
    "if we want to realize these transformation properties on quantum states , we have to find the representations of the v - group acting on complex hilbert spaces .",
    "the algebra of the v - group ( as that of @xmath43 ) can be written as the algebra of @xmath45 . as it is well known from non - relativistic quantum mechanics ,",
    "the rotation group has finite representations that are unitary with its generators represented by angular momentum matrices .",
    "there is one irreducible representation @xmath91 for each finite dimension @xmath92 with @xmath93 integer or semi - integer .",
    "being the v - group the tensor product of two independent rotations , the corresponding quantum generators will be a pair of independent angular momentum matrices .",
    "let us consider transformations on elementry complex hilbert spaces namely two level systems . in this case",
    "the generators are represented by pairs of pauli matrices @xmath94 and @xmath95 acting on two different 2d hilbert spaces .",
    "these matrices have the same transformation properties of their classical counterparts @xmath72 and @xmath75 .",
    "e.g. : @xmath96_{ij}\\ , \\rho_j\\ , , \\ ] ] being @xmath97 . as a consequence",
    "their expectation values transform as classical vectors .",
    "they are the quantum analog of classical unit vectors .",
    "thus , in order to combine rotation symmetry with quantum mechanics we can associate pauli matrices to classical unit vectors . applying this concept to the v - group above",
    "described we obtain : @xmath98 being @xmath99 the identity operator in the @xmath100 space describing the direction of velocity .",
    "it turns out that @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the well - known dirac matrices in the standard representation .",
    "@xmath4 is the velocity vector operator , and eq .",
    "( [ corr1 ] ) allows us to identify @xmath5 as the proper - time speed operator .",
    "also higher order angular - momentum operators transform as classical vectors .",
    "however it is worth noticing that expectation values of pauli matrices have an additional unique property : they obey the following relationship : @xmath101 , implying @xmath102 ( compare with eq .",
    "( [ epstein ] ) ) .",
    "this property ensures a closer adherence of quantum expectation values to classical values .",
    "for example , working with a 3d complex hilbert space ( @xmath103 ) , there would be quantum states displaying both space and proper time speeds equal to zero : @xmath104 in clear contrast with the behaviour of classical relativistic particles .",
    "this observation attributes a unique role to spin @xmath105 particles as the quantum correspondents of classical pointlike particles .",
    "the study of higher order ( @xmath106 ) representations is left for future work , we expect that @xmath103 representations describe vector fields .",
    "in order to better point out our correspondence principle for the dirac equation , we start from eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) describing the energy of a classical free pointlike particle .",
    "it is formally a linear function of momentum and depends on the components of the two unit vectors @xmath107 and @xmath108 : @xmath109 .",
    "if the symmetry properties of these unit vectors have any physical relevance , we should be able to quantize eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) by replacing the spatial and proper time velocities with the corresponding quantum operators according to ( [ corr1 ] ) . performing also the usual operator replacements @xmath110 and @xmath111 , the dirac equation",
    "is indeed obtained : @xmath112 where @xmath47 is a four component wave function .",
    "this alternative derivation of the dirac equation based on the symmetry properties of kinematic rates demonstrates that the symmetry properties of the spatial and proper time velocities play a deep role .",
    "let us look at the solutions of dirac equation of the usual form @xmath113 , where @xmath114 and @xmath115 are states belonging to the two 2d hilbert spaces ( s and r ) where @xmath13 and @xmath116 act respectively .",
    "we assume that only @xmath26 is determined and seek for @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath21 solving the eigenvalue problem obtained after inserting the above solution into eq .",

    "( [ eigen ] ) and multiplying from the left for the same eigenbras , we are left with a pair of equations involving only states in @xmath123 : @xmath124 which more compactly can be writen as    @xmath125    with @xmath126 and @xmath127 the four dirac solutions for a given @xmath26 can thus be written as : @xmath128 with @xmath129 .",
    "they have a precise and simple geometric meaning that can be easily visualized on the bloch sphere ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "positive energy solutions @xmath130 are given by eigenstates of @xmath131 with @xmath132 describing the system aligned along the unit vectors @xmath133 in the first and fourth quadrant .",
    "negative energy solutions @xmath130 , corresponding to antiparticles , are given by eigenstates of @xmath131 with @xmath134 and describe the system aligned along directions in the second and third quadrant which are opposite to @xmath133 .",
    "the results displayed in fig .",
    "2 unequivocably show the correspondence between the classical and quantum descriptions of spin and antiparticles here proposed .",
    "in particular solutions of the dirac equation with negative energy ( corresponding to antiparticles ) display @xmath135 , so the claim that classical states with @xmath136 are the classical correspondent of antiparticles is fully justified .",
    "we finally observe that the present approach describes the transformation from an inertial reference frame to another by rotations , which after quantization imply the rotation on the bloch sphere of the states @xmath137 .",
    "the correct coordinate dependence @xmath138 of the wave function corresponding to the rotated spinors @xmath139 can be uniquely determined by solving the dirac eigenvalue equation with @xmath140 as the unkown function .",
    "so doing ( lorentz ) coordinate transformations can be recovered a posteriori in the spirit of a background - free theory .",
    "we have presented new relativistic linear transformations involving the ordinary velocity and the proper - time rate of change with respect to the time - coordinate of the frame of reference . according to them changes of the velocity modulus and direction",
    "can simply be accounted for by rotations of two independent unit vectors .",

    "in contrast to the homogeneous lorentz group , they form a compact group hence with unitary finite - dimensional representations as all other symmetry groups in qft .",
    "hence the present approach is promising towards a better reconciliation of relativity and quantum mechanics .",
    "the approach here described provides a direct geometric visualization of dirac spinors .",
    "it sacrifies explicit covariance by making explicit rotation symmetry which nevertheless is the fundamental symmetry on which the algebra of the lorentz group is based .    a surprising feature of these results",
    ", requiring further investigations , is that they have been obtained by regarding the position - coordinate and proper - time as functions of the time - coordinate of the reference frame , thus attributing to the latter a special role as required by quantum mechanics . in so doing these transformations put on the same footing @xmath141 and @xmath142 , suggesting for the mass parameter @xmath143 the role of momentum operator conjugate to @xmath59 as @xmath144 to @xmath58 . the symmetric structure of eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) enforces this suggestion .",
    "this would imply an internal time- energy uncertainty principle @xmath145 , in agreement with the evidence of a gedanken experiment proposed by aharonov and rezni @xcite .",
    "further investigations are also required to understand the physical meaning of the @xmath146 axis in the @xmath123 space and hence of the operator @xmath147 which is the generator of speed changes .",
    "it turns out that all the kinematic states in special relativity are described by unit vectors on the @xmath68 plane and consequently dirac eigenstates are made of @xmath123 states on the @xmath68 plane of the bloch sphere .",
    "we envisage that states outside the @xmath68 plane play a role when taking into account gravity .",
