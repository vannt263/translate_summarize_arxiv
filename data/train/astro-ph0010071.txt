    "gravitational lensing provides the only non - dynamical measure of the mass distribution of a galaxy halo , and it thus enables a crucial means of quantifying the dark matter halos that are now an essential component of all theories of cosmology and galaxy formation .",
    "a reliable measure of the masses of galaxies and their halos also provides a significant lower limit to the density parameter @xmath14 .",
    "spiral galaxy halos have traditionally been probed via rotation of stars and gas , but these tracers are not available outside radii of @xmath15  kpc , though their velocities are consistent with with an isothermal halo extending beyond this distance . at larger radii ,",
    "dynamical test particles are scarce : @xcite use satellite galaxies to trace the halo mass profile to @xmath16  kpc . because there are only @xmath17 satellites per spiral , the masses of individual galaxies are poorly constrained , but by `` stacking '' the signals from an ensemble of galaxies , an accurate measure of the mean halo is obtained .",
    "a further complication of such dynamical studies of the outer halo is that the test particles are not virialized , and determination of the halo mass requires some model of infall . with such modelling , @xcite estimate a mass of @xmath18 within 200  kpc of an @xmath5 spiral galaxy .",
    "the gravitational lensing approach uses photons from background galaxies ( bggs ) as the test particles , enabling halo measurements to large radii .",
    "the greatest problem with lensing is the extremely weak shear ( @xmath19 ) associated with the mass of a single galaxy .",
    "this is more than a factor of 10 below the noise due to intrinsic shape variations in a single background galaxy . as with the satellite galaxy study",
    ", the weak lensing approach must therefore overcome the poor @xmath20 per galaxy by using large numbers of lens - source pairs , measuring the average galaxy halo .",
    "the weak lensing measurement , however , requires no modeling of the dynamical state and can give a non - parametric estimate of the halo profile .",
    "the first attempted detection was @xcite , and over the last five years several groups have verified the existence of galaxy - galaxy lensing based upon analysis of a small number of deep fields @xcite .",
    "interpretation of these results is problematic not only because of poor @xmath20 , but also because the redshifts of the lens galaxies ( and hence their distances and luminosities ) are not known individually .",
    "interpretation relies upon positing a model for the joint distance / luminosity distribution of the lenses and sources , and a model for dependence of halo mass and size upon luminosity , then projecting these models down to a function of angular variables to be compared with the observations . in such deep fields , even the statistical distributions of lens and source distances are currently ill - determined .",
    "more recently ( * ? ? ?",
    "* f00 ) have measured a galaxy - galaxy lensing signal at high significance from preliminary sloan digital sky survey data .",
    "these data are relatively shallow ( foreground galaxies @xmath21 , background galaxies @xmath22 ) , which weakens the shear signal , but this is more than compensated by the extremely large sample size of @xmath23 million fgg / bgg pairs .",
    "these data indicate that halos of typical galaxies continue an isothermal profile to a radius of at least 260  .",
    "the conversion from shear amplitude to mass density in the f00 data is still reliant upon photometric redshift distributions for the fggs and bggs .",
    "we present here a detection of galaxy - galaxy lensing around fggs with redshifts determined by the las campanas redshift survey @xcite we thus have knowledge of the fgg luminosity and distance , and the impact parameter of the lensed photons , in physical units ( _ i.e. _ kpc rather than arcsec ) , information that is normally lost in projection .",
    "the bgg s ( @xmath24 ) are at magnitudes within the reach of current pencil - beam redshift surveys , and hence their distance distribution is well enough determined to introduce negligible uncertainty in the calibration .",
    "we are therefore in theory able to measure the galaxy luminosity @xmath25 , halo mass @xmath26 , and surface mass density @xmath27 in physical units without ambiguity ( save the scale factor @xmath2 ) . in practice",
    "our @xmath20 is too low to constrain the extent of the galaxy halo meaningfully , so we combine the f00 profile _ shape _ with our _ normalization _ to obtain a mass profile in absolute units . combining the resultant @xmath28 with the well - determined luminosity function of the lcrs galaxies",
    "@xcite we obtain the galactic contribution to @xmath14 .",
    "we assume an einstein - desitter universe for the values presented here , and use @xmath29 . because the fggs are relatively nearby , and the bggs are far behind them , the dependence of the results upon the cosmological parameters @xmath14 and @xmath30 is negligible ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "we observed 36 square degrees of sky in @xmath32 band using the big throughput camera ( btc ) @xcite on the ctio blanco 4-meter telescope over three runs from december 1996 through march 1999 .",
    "most areas of the target fields are covered by three dithered 420-second exposures .",
    "observations were made within the las campanas redshift survey fields and yield @xmath33 well - measured bggs per @xmath34 , with typical seeing of 11 fwhm and rms sky noise of @xmath35 on 043 pixels .",
    "images are debiased and flattened using standard iraf routines . rather than sum images",
    ", we analyze each 300s exposure separately and average the resulting galaxy measurements .",
    "this allows us to adjust for exposure - to - exposure seeing variations as well as to avoid or isolate various systematic errors .",
    "observations of @xmath32-band standards from @xcite yield photometric solutions with worst - case rms errors of 0.05  mag .",
    "galaxy shape measurements are critical to weak lensing",
    ". detailed descriptions of our methods are presented in @xcite and @xcite . here",
    "we summarize the processing steps .",
    "initial detection , photometry , and size estimation is done by sextractor @xcite .",
    "this information is then fed to our shape measurement code elliptomatic , which determines ellipticities from gaussian - weighted second moments of each object .",
    "the gaussian weights are elliptical ; the weight ellipticity is iterated to match the object s ellipticity , which produces an unbiased estimate of the object shape .",
    "stellar objects are selected from the catalog , and a position - dependent convolution kernel is created which , when applied to the original image , makes the stellar psf round everywhere in the image @xcite this corrects all objects for shape errors induced by telescope tracking , seeing , or linear ccd charge transfer inefficiencies .",
    "optical distortions are significant across the wide field of the btc . observations of astrometric standard fields yield a distortion map , and object shapes are corrected for this distortion analytically , yielding the observed ( post - seeing ) ellipticity components @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the observed shapes are then corrected for the circularizing effects of the psf to give an estimate of the pre - seeing ellipticity @xmath38 and @xmath39 which would be observed in an image with perfect resolution . if this correction is larger than a factor of 5 , the object is discarded .",
    "the measured ellipticities of a given object on different exposures are averaged to give the mean pre - seeing ellipticity for that object .",
    "an estimated uncertainty @xmath40 due to image noise is also calculated for each object .    when considering the distortion induced by a given fgg , the bgg ellipticity is rotated to components @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where the former is positive for an image oriented tangentially to the fgg .",
    "the algorithms used herein to correct for psf anisotropy and circularization are known to leave systematic residuals at the @xmath43 level in the shapes of the galaxies .",
    "these have little effect upon the galaxy - galaxy lensing measurements since one is measuring @xmath44 in annuli about the fggs , and a systematic distortion of constant orientation will cancel to first order when integrated around the annulus .",
    "we will demonstrate the absence of significant systematic errors below .",

    "@xmath40 upon each ellipticity , we may wish to apply some weight function @xmath52 to each bgg shape .",

    "we use the following weight , which can be shown to minimize the variance of the estimator under certain conditions @xcite : @xmath57 alternative choices of weight function lead to results that are indistinguishable within the noise .",
    "we have tested the accuracy of the distortion - measurement algorithms using simulated data frames .",
    "an image of artificial spiral and elliptical galaxies is distorted by a circular isothermal potential , then subjected to degradation by gaussian seeing and noise similar to those in our images .",
    "the artificial images are then run through the software pipeline , and the above equations used to extract the distortion @xmath46 as a function of radius from the putative lens .",
    "the results are plotted in figure  [ calsims ] , which illustrates that the input distortion is recovered to an accuracy of 5% or better as long as the distortion is indeed weak . to insure that the calibration of psf circularization is correct and robust ,",
    "we repeat the simulation with the angular sizes of the bgg s arbitrarily reduced by 30% .",
    "the input distortion is again recovered to the same accuracy .",
    "an additional complication of the real data is that the bgg s are distributed in redshift but the distances to individual galaxies are not known .",
    "pencil - beam redshift surveys give the joint distribution @xmath58 of the background population .",
    "we will assume that the responsivity @xmath51 and weight @xmath59 of the bgg s are uncorrelated with bgg redshift @xmath60 at a given bgg magnitude @xmath61 .",
    "then the @xmath62 quantity in equation  ( [ hatd ] ) is a scaled estimator of the distortion @xmath63 that would be measured for a bgg population at infinite redshift : @xmath64 the @xmath65 s are angular diameter distances between observer , foreground , and background redshifts .",
    "the quantity @xmath63 is thus measurable as long as the distribution of the background weight vs redshift is known .",
    "the redshift distribution of our bgg sample is sufficiently well known from deep redshift surveys that the uncertainty in the factor @xmath66 does not dominate the error budget , as will be discussed in detail below .",
    "the physical quantity of interest is the mean azimuthally averaged surface mass density @xmath67 at radius @xmath32 about galaxies of luminosity @xmath25 .",

    "is known : @xmath78 scaling the measured shear to a standard luminosity and radius requires some model for how the surface density profile varies with these quantities . with a sufficiently large galaxy sample",
    ", one could simply measure the function @xmath79 in narrow bins of @xmath25 and @xmath32 , and non - parametrically map this density contrast as a function of these two variables .",
    "our samples are , however , small enough that our bins must cover a substantial range of @xmath25 and @xmath32 , so we will adopt the assumption that the surface density is described by an isothermal profile with a circular velocity @xmath80 that is a power - law function of luminosity : @xmath81 the scaling functions are then very simple : @xmath82 the canonical distortion is @xmath83    the high - s / n data of f00 produce a mean distortion profile that is fully consistent with the isothermal profile at the radii @xmath84 in which we measure @xmath46 .",
    "the power - law dependence of @xmath27 upon galaxy luminosity @xmath25 is suggested by the tully - fisher and faber - jackson relations , which lead us to choose the value @xmath11 .",

    "our foreground sample consists of all 790 galaxies from the lcrs redshift survey with @xmath92 that lie within our imaged areas .",
    "background galaxies are required to be well - measured on at least two exposures , have magnitude @xmath0 , and correction for psf circularization at most a factor 5 ( this is effectively a lower limit on angular size ) .",
    "this leaves @xmath93 fgg / bgg pairs with impact parameters of @xmath94 .",
    "an absolute determination of mass densities requires an estimate of the distance factor @xmath95 from the weighted redshift distribution of the background galaxies .",
    "the caltech redshift survey of the hubble deep field and its flanking fields ( * ? ? ? * crs ) provides a virtually complete redshift survey to @xmath96 .",

    "thus while the hdf field may be deficient in nearby galaxies , we do not expect a significant effect upon our results .    to estimate the uncertainty in @xmath86 due to @xmath97 errors we turn to the canada - france redshift survery ( * ? ? ?",

    "agreement between our direct inventory and these other measures serves as valuable and unique verification that these assumptions  often fundamental to our current view of cosmology  are correct .",
    "the more precise estimates of @xmath165 include the following : dynamical studies of galaxy clusters , combined with the assumption that the @xmath28 ratio for clusters is universal , yield @xmath167 @xcite .",
    "another cluster - based means to @xmath14 is to measure the fraction @xmath168 of the cluster matter that is baryonic , assume that the cluster @xmath168 is universal , and then use the baryon density @xmath169 from big bang nucleosynthesis to estimate @xmath170 .",
    "@xcite conclude that @xmath171 ( for @xmath172 ) .",
    "other estimates of @xmath14 measure its effects upon global geometry or the growth rate of fluctuations in the universe . in the former category ,",
    "the combination of high - redshift supernovae measurements and the location of the cosmic background doppler peaks measured by maxima-1 constrain @xmath173 at 95% cl @xcite .",
    "peculiar velocity studies determine the parameter @xmath174 to be @xmath175 @xcite , with @xmath176 a galaxy bias parameter .",
    "taking @xmath177 gives a value of @xmath178 , again slightly above our halo density .",
    "conversely our lower limit on @xmath14 implies a bias parameter for iras galaxies @xmath179 .",
    "thus our results may be taken as independent evidence that these underlying assumptions are correct : cluster @xmath28 and baryon fractions can be taken as representative ; general relativity does properly describe the geometry of the universe to @xmath180 given our directly measured matter content ; and large - scale motions are consistent with the predictions of gravitational instability .",
    "conversely , we may take the @xmath166 value as truth and conclude from these lensing results that most of the matter in the universe is indeed contained within 260  of normal galaxies .",
    "this implies that galaxies missed by the lcrs survey_e.g .",
    "_ low - surface - brightness galaxies or exotic dark galaxies  cannot be the dominant reservoirs of mass in the universe . likewise there can not be a dominant matter component which is not clustered around galaxies . most of the mass in the universe appears to have been located , though of course its material nature remains unknown .",
    "the accuracy of our results is currently limited by the number of foreground / background pairs in our survey .",
    "this will be remedied in dramatic fashion by the full sloan digital sky survey , which will obtain imaging to @xmath181 around roughly _ three orders of magnitude _ more foreground galaxies than used in this study with a concomitant increase in the number of pairs .",
    "this will allow for non - parametric mapping of the shear profile as a function of radius , galaxy luminosity , and galaxy type , with much lower noise than in our lcrs lensing survey .",
    "this weak lensing information will be unique in unveiling the relation between the various classes of galaxies and the dark halos in which they reside . with the random errors reduced",
    ", closer attention will have to be paid to some of the @xmath126 corrections we have ignored ( as in f00 ) , but these are tractable .",
    "our estimates of @xmath182 and @xmath14 are lower bounds since the profile of the halo has not yet been determined beyond 260 . beyond this radius",
    "it becomes inappropriate to speak of `` the halo '' of a galaxy , as the mass profile of a given galaxy becomes inseparable from the mass associated with neighboring galaxies .",
    "more stringent limits on @xmath14 will thus require a more elaborate formalism for describing the effects of galaxy correlations upon the weak lensing measurements .",
    "this work was supported by grant ast-9624592 from the national science foundation .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge the assistance of j. a. tyson and david wittman with the construction and operation of the btc camera and their contributions to the data pipeline ; tim mckay and erin sheldon for continued discussions of sdss lensing results ; and the staff of ctio for their enthusiastic support of the btc observations ."
