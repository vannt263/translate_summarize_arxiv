    "x - ray emission is ubiquitous in the o stars and taken as an indication of dynamic instabilities in their winds @xcite .",
    "these 1-d hydrodynamical models predict a plasma with temperature @xmath4 10mk , which is permeated with cool wind clumps .",
    "the models also predict very strong stochastic x - ray variability , on time scales of hours .",
    "however , it has been clear since early x - ray observations , that stochastic variability on such short time scales is very small , less than about 1% .",
    "to explain this , @xcite suggested that the winds contain thousands of shocks , and @xcite speculated that models with full 2-d hydrodynamics would reduce the predicted level of stochastic x - ray variability . in the most extensive analysis to date , @xcite examined high quality _ xmm - newton _ observations of the early o supergiant @xmath5pup .",
    "they used an _ ad hoc _ 2-d wind model and found that the lack of stochastic x - ray variability on short time scales required a highly fragmented wind with a huge number of small clumps . in this picture ,",
    "a stellar wind consists of a large population of cool clumps , which contain the bulk of the stellar wind matter seen at uv , optical , ir and radio wavelengths , and a tenuous hot interclump medium responsible for the x - rays .",
    "further evidence for small scale clumping has come from the analysis of optical and uv wind lines .",
    "@xcite found that it was necessary to introduce clumping to explain the shapes of electron scattering emission line wings in wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars .",
    "given the 1-dimensional nature of his model , this would imply the presence of either concentric shells or random structures whose size and separation are much smaller than the sobolev length , so that the angle integrations are meaningful .",
    "stochastic variable features in the heii @xmath6   emission line in @xmath5pup were found by @xcite , and explained as excess emission from the wind clumps .",
    "@xcite investigated h@xmath1 line - profile variability in a large sample of o - type supergiants , and concluded that the observed variability can be explained by a wind model consisting of coherent or broken shells .",
    "@xcite presented direct spectroscopic evidence of clumping in o and wr star winds .",
    "besides this small scale clumping , a different , perhaps related , aspect of o star winds is that all of them which have been observed over time scales of a day or more demonstrate temporally coherent uv wind line variability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this phenomenon suggests the presence of large structures in their winds which * may * originate from large regions on the surface of the star .",
    "these results led @xcite to model wind variability by large spiral structures known as co - rotating interaction regions ( cirs , * ? ? ?",
    "these structures originate from large regions of enhanced wind flux on the surface of the star , although the exact cause of the enhanced wind remains unexplained .",
    "@xcite showed that the observed uv line variability can not be simply explained as a consequence of rotation in the framework of the cir model , and a more complex interplay between rotation and radial velocity is taking place .",
    "further , @xcite analyzed the doublet ratios of wind lines of a large number of b supergiants .",
    "their results demonstrated that the spectral signature of large , optically thick wind structures which cover only a portion of the line of sight to the stellar disk ( most likely cirs ) is common in the b supergiants .",
    "the interplay between cirs and small scale clumping is largely unexplored .",
    "a crude analysis by @xcite suggested an intricate interaction between the two .",
    "@xcite considered 3-d hydrodynamic models of cirs . while their models could reproduce the detailed time evolution of uv spectral features in a b - type supergiant , they expressed concern that too much small scale clumping could destroy the cirs .",
    "whatever the mechanism of x - ray production , the presence of large scale structures in stellar winds should leave a footprint on the x - ray emission . in particular , x - ray variability on a time scale compatible with the stellar rotation period should be present , and this x - ray variability should correlate with uv wind line variability . however , there are considerable observational obstacles to establishing a link between x - ray and uv wind line variability for single , normal o stars .",
    "first , the cirs are thought to be confined to the equatorial plane .",
    "consequently , variability may not be seen unless our line of sight to the star is relatively close to equator - on .",
    "second , the stellar rotation period for most o stars is several days .",
    "this is considerably longer than the typical x - ray observation , so variability could easily be missed .",
    "third , there are only a few stars which have been observed in the uv over long enough intervals for good wind line periods to be identified , and such a period is needed to claim a definite connection between x - ray and uv wind line variability .",
    "fourth , binary stars with colliding stellar winds must be excluded from any investigation of the connection between x - rays and large scale wind structure .    despite these hurdles , observational evidence supporting a link between cirs and x - ray emission from stellar winds",
    "is mounting . recently",
    ", x - ray variability of @xmath7% and on the time scale of recurrent dacs was detected in the wr star ez cma , and explained in the framework of the cir model @xcite .",
    "more relevant to the current paper , is the work on o stars by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite found a marginal detection of a periodic x - ray variability in @xmath5  pup , which was not confirmed by @xcite or @xcite and not in agreement with dac period determined by @xcite .",
    "@xcite analyzed a series of x - ray observations of @xmath5  pup which span 10years .",
    "they detected a slow modulation of the x - ray flux with a relative amplitude up to 15%  over 16 hours in the 0.3 - 4.0  kev band .",
    "they propose that these modulations can be attributed to cirs",
    ". the most compelling evidence to date was given by the @xcite analysis of the rapidly rotating o dwarf @xmath5oph .",
    "it is the only single o star that has been observed continuously in x - rays over a full rotational period .",
    "these observations showed that the x - ray variability occurred on a time scale similar to the uv wind line variability , but they were not long enough to show that the pattern repeated on the rotation time scale .",
    "unfortunately , there were no simultaneous observations of the wind activity that could be used to determine the phase relation between the x - ray and wind activity .",
    "such a relationship could provide valuable clues about the geometric relationship between the x - ray emitting plasma and the cirs .",
    "in this paper we present x - ray observations covering nearly half of a rotation period of the o7  iii(n)((f ) ) star @xmath8  per , supplemented by optical @xmath2  observations which bracket the x - ray observations .",
    "@xmath8  per is an ideal candidate for attempting to make a connection between uv wind line and x - ray variability .",
    "first of all , @xmath0  per appears to be a perfectly normal o7 giant ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for descriptions of its optical and uv spectra , respectively ) .",
    "its only distinguishing feature is that it has a somewhat high ( but not abnormal ) rotational velocity of @xmath9 km  s@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "because of its moderate @xmath11 , its expected rotation period is short enough to be captured by a time series of manageable duration .",
    "this was done in a detailed study of its uv and optical line variability by @xcite .",
    "they demonstrated the presence of a well characterized , distinctive 2.086  day period in the uv wind line variability .",
    "this turns out to be roughly half of the expected rotation period if the star is viewed nearly equator - on ( see their figure  4 ) .",
    "further , they were able to model the variability by two sets of two armed cirs ( see , their figure  17 ) , with one set of arms dominating the variability .",
    "they were also able to establish a relationship between the appearance of the discrete absorption components ( dacs ) associated with the cirs and variations in the blue wing of @xmath2 , which enable us to use @xmath2  variability as a surrogate for dac activity .",
    "these properties of @xmath0  per , together with its relative brightness at x - ray wavelengths , make it an ideal candidate to determine whether the cirs that are thought to modulate the uv wind lines in this star ( and possibly all luminous ob stars with massive winds ) might modulate its x - ray flux as well . to pursue this conjecture",
    ", we obtained a 162  ks ( 0.45 rotation periods and 0.90 periods of the strong cir activity ) _ chandra _ observation of @xmath0  per .",
    "the x - ray and optical observations are described in ",
    "[ observations ] , anlyzed for variability in  [ analysis ] and discussed in  [ discussion ] .",
    "although a continuous observation of 2.1  d is required to be certain that the full range of variability is observed , as one arm of the cir pattern traverses our line of sight , the maximum visibility of @xmath0  per to _ chandra _ was @xmath12  ks ( 1.9  d ) , or roughly 90% of the uv wind line modulation period . the observations were obtained with _",
    "s transmission high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ) and began on 2004 march 22 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the high energy transmission grating , hetg , consists of two sets of gratings ; the medium energy grating ( meg ) and the high energy grating ( heg ) @xcite .",
    "the events were recorded on the acis - s chips and consist of a @xmath14 first order dispersed spectrum for both the meg and heg and a directly transmitted , zeroth order , image .",
    "some spectral information can be extracted from the zeroth order image through the energy determined for the individual events .",
    "all of the data were processed with version 3.3 of the _ chandra _ interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) software package .",
    "the newly reduced data can be found in the  the _ chandra _ grating - data archive and catalog ( tgcat ) ",
    "see the ciao documents for further information .",
    "pile - up ( the arrival of two photons near the same location between ccd reads ) was not a major issue for the observations .",
    "the strongest lines in the meg spectra only had count rates of @xmath15  counts s@xmath10 and the count rate of the zeroth order image was @xmath16  counts  s@xmath10 . in the first case ,",
    "pile - up is completely negligible , and in the latter it never exceeds 5% .",
    "further , pile up will only mute the amplitude of variability and not make a constant source appear variable .",
    "we now describe how we filtered the initial data to maximize the contribution from the source and minimize background effects .",
    "we utilize the _",
    "chandra _  primary time tag photon list for our analysis .",
    "specifically , we use the following tags attached to each event : @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the sky coordinates ; @xmath19 , the event energy estimated from the number of ccd counts it created ; @xmath20 , the shape descriptor of the ccd count distribution of the event ; @xmath21 , the time at which the event was read ; @xmath22 , the likely grating order , @xmath23 , associated with an event ; @xmath24 , the wavelength for the @xmath25 events based on their location relative to the dispersion , and ; @xmath26 , the probable association of a photon with either the heg or meg spectrum of the zeroth order image based on its location .",
    "see , the ciao web site for further information .",
    "to simplify matters , we begin by `` rotating '' the @xmath17 and @xmath18 sky coordinates by @xmath27 , to produce a primed coordinate system in which the first order meg spectra are aligned with the @xmath28-axis . figure  [ fig : image ] shows a portion of the detector in the rotated frame .",
    "the events in this image have been filtered as follows : @xmath29 , asca grades of 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 or 6 ( as done in normal processing ) , and @xmath30  kev , which corresponds to the wavelength range of interest , @xmath31  .",
    "the @xmath32 image appears as a spot near the center of the figure , and the meg @xmath33 spectra are the vertical strips which lie on either side of it .",
    "the faint diagonal stripes are the heg spectra , which are not considered further , since they contain very few counts .",
    "we note two important properties of figure  [ fig : image ] .",
    "first , the zeroth order image is localized and resides on a single ccd .",
    "second , in spite of filtering , there are considerable extraneous events in the cross - dispersion direction , well away from the center of the meg @xmath34 spectra . to emphasize this",
    ", we filtered the events list further to produce cross - dispersion profiles . figure  [ fig : profs ] shows the cross dispersion profiles for the meg @xmath35 events collapsed along the @xmath28 axis , compared to all of the @xmath36 events , similarly collapsed .",
    "the first order events were restricted further to include only counts with @xmath37 ( which eliminates heg data ) and wavelength tags in the range @xmath31 .",
    "this last restriction differs from the energy filtering since it also includes location on the detector .    because the events on the wings of the first order cross - dispersion profile do not appear in the zeroth order image , they are not from the sky",
    "this is further verified by examining their spectral signature , which turns out to be featureless ",
    "free of emission lines .",
    "therefore , these counts will not carry the time dependence of the source and we should eliminate as many as possible . to do this ,",
    "we restrict the first order events to those which lie in the range @xmath38 .",
    "there are 5782 counts in the refined region , compared to 7580 when all @xmath39 events are included  a reduction of 31% .",
    "assuming that the source counts are all contained in the restricted area and that the background counts are uniformly distributed over the region @xmath40 ( see figure  [ fig : profs ] ) we can estimate the total number of background and source counts .",
    "let @xmath41 and @xmath42 be the total number of source and background counts over the region from @xmath40 .",
    "now let @xmath43 be the observed counts over the larger region and @xmath44 be the observed counts over the restricted region .",
    "then , @xmath45 and @xmath46 . solving these two equations",
    "gives @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "thus , 28% of @xmath49 are background counts compared to only 5.2% of @xmath50 .",
    "consequently , although some background counts remain in @xmath50 , their effect should not be too great .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath36 image has 5915 counts and appears to contain far fewer background counts .",
    "therefore , it was not filtered any further .",
    "the filtered events from the zeroth order image and first order spectra were resampled into 2 hour time bins for better statistics .",
    "figure  [ fig : compare ] compares the two time series . in this figure , each series was normalized by its mean value for comparison purposes and the error bars are based on poisson statistics from the number of counts in each bin .",
    "it is clear that both series display a general decreasing trend over the extent of the observation .",
    "therefore , the two were added to arrive at the summed series shown in figure  [ fig : combined ] , where each bin contains several hundred counts , making it reasonable to approximate the intrinsic poisson statistics by gaussian statistics .",
    "while the period of dac variability in @xmath0  per is reasonably well defined , it probably originates from surface features , and there is no reason to expect long term coherence .",
    "consequently , to determine the phase relation between the x - ray and dac variability at the time of the _ chandra _  time series , we need observations which predict dac occurrence and are obtained close to the time of the x - ray observations . to do this",
    ", we use the @xcite result that variable absorption of the blue wing of @xmath2  is essentially in phase with the dacs ( see their table  5 ) .",
    "consequently , @xmath2   observations were obtained within @xmath51 days of the _ chandra _  data , in order to determine the relative phases of the x - rays and the dacs .",
    "spectra were obtained at three north american sites : the david dunlap observatory ( ddo ) ; the ritter observatory ( ritter ) ; and the dominion astrophysical observatory ( dao ) .",
    "our optical observations bracket and overlap the x - ray observations .",
    "they begin 6.6 days prior to the _ chandra _  observations and conclude 7.7 days after .",
    "they span a total of 16.1 days , roughly centered on the _ chandra_series .",
    "since @xcite have demonstrated that the cir related spectral features remain well phased over the 9.4 day interval of their _ iue _ time series , it seems reasonable to assume that they remain in phase over the time interval of our optical data , which is less than twice as long .",
    "one high - quality spectrum was obtained with the cassegrain spectrograph of the ddo 1.88 m telescope .",
    "the observation was made through a 242  @xmath52 m slit with the 1800 lines / mm grating in first order .",
    "the detector was a jobin - yvon thinned , back - illuminated ccd with 2000@xmath53800 pixels .",
    "this configuration provided a linear reciprocal dispersion of 0.153   per 15  @xmath52 m pixel .",
    "bias frames , tungsten lamp flat field observations and fe - ar lamp wavelength observations were obtained immediately before and after the stellar observation .",
    "three spectra were obtained with the ritter 1.06  m telescope .",
    "these were obtained with the bench - mounted chelle spectrograph , coupled to the cassegrain focus of the telescope by a 200  @xmath52 m wide optical fiber .",
    "the detector was a front - illuminated eev ccd with 1200@xmath53800 pixels , each of which is 22.5  @xmath52 m square . at @xmath2 ( order 34 ) ,",
    "the spectrograph has resolving power of @xmath54 , and the entrance slit projects to @xmath554.3 pixels .",
    "the observed positions of telluric water vapour lines were first used with the wavelengths given by @xcite to correct nonlinearities in the wavelength scale determined from the comparison arc .",
    "after telluric correction , the ritter spectra were binned by a factor of 2 to improve the s / n .",
    "the dao 1.22 m mckellar telescope and coud spectrograph were used in `` robotic '' mode to obtain seventeen spectra on 4 nights .",
    "the `` 9681 m '' configuration of the spectrograph was used with the site-4 ccd detector , which is a thinned , back - illuminated array of 4096 @xmath53 2048 pixels , each of which is 15 @xmath52 m square .",
    "this configuration results in a spectrum with linear reciprocal dispersion of 0.073   / pixel .",
    "additional observations of a tungsten continuum source and th - ar emission spectrum were obtained to provide flat field and wavelength calibrations , respectively .",
    "standard _ iraf _ routines were used to process the ccd frames obtained at all three observatories .",
    "telluric line contamination was removed by using templates derived from contemporaneous spectra of the rapidly rotating b7  v @xmath1 leo .",
    "the late march date of the _ chandra _  observations had two consquences for the ground - based campaign .",
    "first , @xmath0  per could only be observed for @xmath562  hours at the beginning of each night .",
    "consequently , a significant phase range of the 2.086-day period could not be covered during a single night , and nearly the same phase was observed every second night .",
    "second , the weather is not traditionally very good at any of the observatories in march . as a result ,",
    "the phase coverage is fairly sparse .",
    "since the phase coverage on any given night was extremely limited , mean spectra were computed whenever possible in order to improve the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio .",
    "the nightly mean spectra are illustrated in figure  [ hastack ] .",
    "we define the `` blue wing '' equivalent width of @xmath2 , @xmath57(@xmath2 ) , as the integrated mean spectra between @xmath58  kms@xmath10 of line center ( measured in the stellar reference frame ) .",
    "the prescription of @xcite was used to estimate uncertainties in @xmath57(@xmath2 ) .",
    "table  [ journal ] summarizes the optical data .",
    "successive columns record the heliocentric julian data ( hjd ) corresponding to the mid - point of the mean spectrum ; the observatory ; the number of spectra averaged ; the exposure time per spectrum in seconds ; the s / n per pixel in the continuum of the mean spectrum ; and @xmath57(@xmath2 ) in  .",
    ".journal of ground - based observations[journal ] [ cols=\"<,^,>,>,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : fit_params ]    the reduced @xmath59 statistic indicates that the cosine function provides the best fit , but that it is not significantly better than the linear or exponential functions .",
    "the coefficient errors are extremely large for the exponential because they are strongly correlated , i.e. , the coefficients can be changed together by large , but related , amounts and still produce a good fit .    finally , we examined the time dependence of the hardness ratio .",
    "this was done by dividing the combined meg @xmath35 and @xmath36 spectrum into two bands : a `` soft '' band ( events with @xmath60  kev ) , and ; a `` hard '' band ( events with @xmath61  kev ) .",
    "this division gives comparable counts in each band .",
    "we then examined the time dependence of their ratio in 2 hour bins for variability .",
    "the errors for the ratios were calculated using standard propagation of errors . in this case , no significant evidence for variability was found .",
    "for example , dividing the high energy bin by the lower energy bin gives @xmath62 over the first half of the observation and @xmath63 over the second half . because the bulk wind opacity scales as @xmath64 ,",
    "if an overall variability @xmath3% is due to variable absorption ( as might be caused by periodic occultation by the spiral cir pattern ) , one might expect an even larger variation at shorter wavelengths . however , this is not observed .",
    "one possible explanation for the absence of wavelength dependence of the variability is optically thick structures which occult different fractions of the source of the x - rays .",
    "if this is the case , the x - ray variability and its lack of wavelength dependence may provide powerful constraints on the geometry of cirs and the source of the x - rays .",
    "we now turn to the @xmath2  data .",
    "figure  [ fig : hax ] shows the @xmath57(@xmath2 ) data fit by the same cosine function used for the x - rays along with the cosine function phased to the x - rays .",
    "the fit parameters are listed in table  [ tab : fit_params ] .",
    "although the data are sparse and the error bars large , formally , the fit is quite good .",
    "the @xmath2  and the x - rays are 17.2 hours , or 124@xmath65 , out of phase .",
    "this means that when the @xmath2   absorption is strongest , the x - ray emission is nearly at its weakest .",
    "the major results of this section are that the x - ray spectrum of @xmath0  per is variable at the level of @xmath3% ( determined from the cosine fit parameters ) , that the variability is consistent with modulation by the 2.086  day period associated with the cirs , that no variation in the hardness of the spectrum could be detected , suggesting that the variability is due to partial obscuration by optically thick structures and that the magnitude of @xmath57(@xmath2 ) is distinctly out of phase with the intensity of the x - rays .",
    "there are basically two ways to generate x - ray variability .",
    "one is _ via _ an impulsive event , and the other is by occulting the source with absorbing gas or the stellar disk , as in the case of @xmath5  oph @xcite .",
    "however , if the variability were due to an impulsive , flare - like event , it must have occurred long before the observations ( since the form of the variability is nearly linear , indicative of an exponential tail ) .",
    "this implies that the event would have been quite strong .",
    "another possibility would be a flare on an unseen pre - main sequence companion .",
    "however , the x - ray luminosity of @xmath0  per is @xmath66 erg sec@xmath10 @xcite , while the x - ray luminosities of pms stars are typically a factor of 10 smaller ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "further , the observed spectral change is grey and soft , very uncharacteristic for flare spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "while not impossible , either scenario seems unlikely , especially since the form of the variability and its autocorrelation function are consistent with cyclical behavior . as a result , we favor the explanation that the x - rays vary because of obscuration by intervening material .",
    "in addition to @xmath0  per , x - ray variability has been observed in two other single , non - magnetic o stars : @xmath5  pup , and @xmath5  oph ( o9.5 vnn , * ? ? ?",
    "both vary on time scales which may be related to their stellar rotation periods .",
    "an analysis of several years of x - ray data for @xmath5  pup showed evidence for variability on a time scale similar to its dacs , but no single time series encompassed a rotation period .",
    "the best evidence for the interaction between cirs and x - rays to date is the @xmath5  oph data set .",
    "it was observed for @xmath67 days and its x - ray flux was found to vary by about 20% .",
    "further , this variation appeared to repeat with a period of about 0.77 days , roughly half of the stellar rotation period and similar to a period previously determined from its uv wind lines ( @xmath68  days ) by @xcite .",
    "however , no information relating the phases of the x - rays and the dacs was available , so it was impossible to constrain the geometry of the cirs and x - rays .    in this paper , we have presented three observational results which help constrain the relation of the cirs and x - rays .",
    "these are : x - ray variability , consistent with the period observed in the dacs ; a constant hardness ratio for the x - rays , suggesting that the source of the x - rays becomes partial obscured by optically thick structures along the line of sight , and ; a phase lag of 124@xmath65 between the maximum absorption on the blue wing of @xmath2  and the maximum strength of the x - rays .    to interpret our limited set of observations ( covering roughly half of a rotation period ) in terms of the geometry of cirs requires some constraints .",
    "we follow @xcite and adopt the following 3 assumptions :    1 .   *",
    "the wind of @xmath0 per contains two pairs of spiral arms , with one arm in each pair being much stronger than the other .",
    "we concentrate on the two major arms , which are equally spaced . *",
    "the wind structures follow streak lines whose shapes are defined by the stellar rotational velocity , wind velocity law and terminal velocity .",
    "we adopt a rotational velocity equal to the observed @xmath69  kms@xmath10 , a velocity law of the form @xmath70 $ ] , where @xmath71  km  s@xmath10 and @xmath72 .",
    "the @xmath2  emission originates near the base of the wind and is associated with the spiral structures . since increased emission reduces @xmath57(@xmath2 ) , the @xmath2  emission and x - ray variability are nearly in phase .",
    "in addition , we note that the grey nature of the variability suggests that the x - ray variations are due to occultation of the x - ray source by either the stellar disk or wind structures that are optically very thick to x - rays .    thus , we seek configurations where the x - ray emission and @xmath2  emission are roughly in phase .",
    "however , even with these restrictions , there is still considerable latitude in how the geometry can be arranged .",
    "we consider two possibilities , but others may be possible .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : cartoons ] shows the first configuration .",
    "it places the x - ray emission along the interacting edge of the spirals .",
    "this might be the case if some or most of the x - rays originate at the fast wind ",
    "slow wind interface , which creates the cirs .",
    "further , because the velocity differential between the fast and slow winds ( and , presumably the potential to produce x - rays ) is expected to drop with distance from the star , one expects most of the x - rays to originate within @xmath73 .",
    "thus , viewing the figure from the right , we see that the @xmath2  and x - ray emitting regions are at or near maximum .",
    "then , as the configuration rotates counter - clockwise , our view would be from below . in this case , one lobe of the @xmath2  emission and much of the x - ray emission near the star are occulted by the stellar disk , producing a minimum in both .",
    "finally , as the system rotates further and our view is from the left , and we have returned to a maximum once again .    for this configuration to explain the observations , the arms must represent a relatively low density contrast in the wind since we do not observe spectral changes in the x - ray spectrum indicative of absorption .",
    "this is in accordance with typical cir models , where uv dac formation is attributed mostly to a velocity plateau .",
    "however , in contrast to the classic line driven instability ( ldi ) model ( which predicts that the x - ray source should be distributed relatively uniformly throughout the wind ) the observed variability implies that the cirs must account for a large fraction of the x - rays .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : cartoons ] depicts a second possible configuration .",
    "it consists of a spherically symmetric x - ray emitting region which is heavily weighted toward the inner wind ( in accordance with the ldi model ) and two spiral arms . as before , the @xmath2  emission originates near the base of the spiral arms . to obtain the x - ray variability , we must assume that the spiral arms are optically very thick , and that their line of sight optical depth decreases with distance from the star .",
    "the latter assumption corresponds to the spiral structures expanding with a constant solid angle , causing their line of sight column density to decrease as @xmath74 near the star . as a result ,",
    "sight lines toward the inner wind are strongly obscured by the spiral arms . when viewed from the right , the arms present minimal absorption and",
    "both the x - ray emission and @xmath2  emission are at maximum . when viewed from below , the denser , inner portion of the spiral pattern occults the x - ray source and both the @xmath2  the x - ray emission are near a minimum .",
    "finally , when viewed from the left , both once again return to a maximum .",
    "this configuration agrees with typical ldi models , since the x - rays are distributed throughout the wind .",
    "however , in contrast to normal cir models , the spiral patterns must have large column densities to account for the grey variability , and this implies that much of the wind flow is channeled through the cirs .",
    "regardless of which , if either , configuration is correct , the important point is that cyclical x - ray variability is inconsistent with our current understanding of either wind structure formation , x - ray production , or both .",
    "consequently , it may provide additional clues on how to interpret wind structure .",
    "further , depending on how the wind material is distributed , the cirs may account for a small fraction of the wind flow , as predicted by normal cir theory @xcite or , if they originate from regions of localized magnetic activity @xcite , a much larger fraction .",
    "thus , it is critical to verify our results if we are to arrive at a self - consistent understanding of stellar winds and mass loss rates in ob stars .",
