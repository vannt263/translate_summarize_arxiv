    "understanding the properties of water near hydrophobic surfaces continues to attract attention across several different disciplines,@xcite ranging from the design of self - cleaning materials @xcite to biological self - assembly and protein interactions.@xcite likewise , understanding the ( water mediated ) interactions between hydrophobic and hydrophilic entities is important in many areas of physical chemistry and chemical physics . in a recent article , kandu _",
    "et al._@xcite survey the field and describe informatively how the behaviour of soft - matter at the nano - scale depends crucially on surface properties and outline the key role played by water mediated interactions in many technological and biological processes .",
    "these include colloid science , where altering the surface chemistry can change enormously the effective interactions , e.g. those preventing aggregation , and biological matter where effective membrane - membrane interactions can be important in biological processes .    in attempting to ascertain the nature of effective interactions , it is crucial to know whether a certain substrate , or entity , is hydrophilic or hydrophobic . for a macroscopic ( planar ) substrate the degree of hydrophobicity",
    "is measured by young s contact angle @xmath2 .",
    "a strongly hydrophobic surface , such as a self - assembled monolayer ( sam ) , paraffin or hydrocarbon , can have @xmath3 , while a strongly hydrophilic surface can often correspond to complete wetting , i.e.  @xmath4 , meaning a water drop spreads across the whole surface .",
    "however , in the majority of systems encountered in the physical chemistry of colloids , in nanoscience and in situations pertinent to biological systems , the entities immersed in water do not have a macroscopic surface area .",
    "thus it is important to ask to what extent ideas borrowed from a macroscopic ( capillarity ) description , which simply balance bulk ( volume ) and surface ( area ) contributions to the total grand potential but which make specific predictions for the effective interaction between two immersed macroscopic hydrophobic entities , remain valid at the nanoscale .",
    "for example , huang _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite consider the phenomenon of capillary evaporation of spc water between two hydrophobic oblate ( ellipsoidal ) plates .",
    "these authors discuss the validity of the macroscopic formula at which evaporation occurs and the form of the solvent mediated force between the plates .",
    "more recently , jabes _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite investigate the solvent - induced interactions for spc / e water between curved hydrophobes ; they consider the influence of different types of confining geometry and conclude that macroscopic thermodynamic ( capillarity ) arguments work surprisingly well , even at length scales corresponding to a few molecular ( water ) diameters . the survey article ref",
    ".   emphasises the usefulness of capillarity ideas for analysing water mediated forces between two entities that have different adsorbing strengths .",
    "such observations raise the general physics question as to how well should one expect capillarity arguments to work for nanoscale entities immersed in an arbitrary solvent .",
    "are these observations specific to water ?",
    "this seems most unlikely . in this paper",
    "we argue that insight into fundamental aspects of solvent mediated interactions , particularly those pertaining to solvophobes , are best addressed by considering the effective , solvent mediated interactions between nanostructures immersed in a simple lennard - jones ( lj ) liquid . by focusing on a model liquid with much simpler intermolecular forces than those in water",
    ", one can investigate more easily and more systematically the underlying physics , e.g.  the length scales relevant for phenomena such as capillary evaporation and how these determine the effective interactions .",
    "a second , closely related , aspect of our present study is concerned with the strength and range of density fluctuations in water close to hydrophobic substrates .",
    "it is now accepted that for water near a macroscopic strongly hydrophobic substrate the local number density of the water is reduced below that in bulk for the first one or two adsorbed molecular layers . accompanying this reduction in local density",
    "there is growing evidence for a substantial increase in fluctuations in the local number density ; these increase for increasing water contact angle . an illuminating review  @xcite surveys the field up to 2011 , describing earlier work on density fluctuations , from the groups of garde , hummer , and chandler .",
    "the basic idea of garde and co - workers is that a large value of some , appropriately defined , local compressibility reflects the strength of density fluctuations in the neighbourhood of the substrate and should provide a quantitative measure of the degree of hydrophobicity of the hydrophobic entity.@xcite the idea is appealing .",
    "however , even for a macroscopic planar substrate , there are problems in deciding upon the appropriate measure .",
    "once again , this issue is not specific to water .",
    "if strong fluctuations occur at hydrophobic surfaces one should also expect these to occur at solvophobic surfaces , for similar values of chemical potential deviation from bulk coexistence .",
    "in other words , pronounced fluctuations can not be specific to water near hydrophobic substrates .",
    "this argument was outlined recently.@xcite    evans and stewart  @xcite discuss the merits of various different quantities that measure surface fluctuations .",
    "they argue that the compressibility @xmath1 , defined as the derivative of the equilibrium density , @xmath0 , with respect to the chemical potential @xmath5 at fixed temperature @xmath6 : @xmath7 provides the most natural and useful measure for quantifying the local fluctuations in an inhomogeneous liquid .",
    "this quantity was introduced much earlier,@xcite in studies of wetting / drying and confined fluids and is , of course , calculated in the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "the usual isothermal compressibility  @xcite @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the bulk value of the compressibility ; recall that @xmath10 on approaching the bulk fluid critical point .",
    "note that @xmath1 can be expressed@xcite as the correlator @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the particle density operator , @xmath14 is the number of particles and @xmath15 denotes a grand canonical average .",
    "thus @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the average number of particles .",
    "clearly @xmath1 correlates the local number density at @xmath18 with the total number of particles in the system .",
    "the measures of @xmath1 introduced by other authors@xcite are designed for molecular dynamics computations which are performed in the canonical ensemble rather than in the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "the latter is more appropriate for adsorption studies .    using dft , evans and stewart  @xcite calculated @xmath19 defined by eq .   for lj liquids near planar substrates , with the wall at @xmath20 .",
    "they investigated substrates which ranged from neutral @xmath21 to very solvophobic @xmath22 and found that this quantity is enhanced over bulk , exhibiting a peak for @xmath23 within one or two atomic diameters of the substrate .",
    "the height of the peak increased significantly as @xmath2 increased and the substrate became more solvophobic . in subsequent investigations , using grand canonical monte carlo ( gcmc ) for spc / e water  @xcite and gcmc plus dft for a lj liquid  @xcite at model solvophobic substrates , it was observed the the maximum in @xmath19 increases rapidly as the strength of the wall - fluid attraction is reduced , thereby increasing @xmath2 towards @xmath24 , i.e.  towards complete drying . for different choices of wall - fluid potentials",
    "the drying transition is continuous ( critical ) and the thickness of the intruding gas - like layer as well as the maximum in @xmath19 diverge as @xmath25 .",
    "@xcite these observations pertain to the liquid at coexistence , where @xmath26 .",
    "much is made in the literature concerning the depleted local density and accompanying enhanced surface fluctuations of water at hydrophobic surfaces as arising from the particular properties of water , namely the hydrogen - bonding and the open tetrahedrally coordinated liquid structure , which is said to be disrupted by the presence of large enough hydrophobic objects . however , following from refs .",
    "we show here that much of this phenomenology is also observed when a simple lj like solvent that is near to bulk gas - liquid phase coexistence is in contact with solvophobic objects .",
    "the particular entities we consider are i ) planar surfaces of infinite area and ii ) long blocks with a finite rectangular - cross - section . for these objects to be solvophobic , we treat them as being composed of particles to which the solvent particles are attracted weakly , compared to the strength of the attraction between solvent particles themselves .",
    "the contact angle of the solvent liquid at the planar solvophobic substrate considered here is @xmath27 .",
    "we also consider the behaviour at solvophilic objects , for which the contact angle at the corresponding planar substrate is @xmath28 .",
    "the simple lj like solvent we consider consists of particles with a hard - sphere pair interaction plus an additional attractive tail potential that decays @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the distance between the solvent particles .",
    "we use classical density functional theory ( dft),@xcite treating the hard core interactions using the white - bear version of fundamental measure theory ( fmt),@xcite together with a mean - field treatment of the attractive interactions , to calculate the solvent density profile @xmath0 and local compressibility @xmath1 .",
    "an advantage of using dft is that having calculated @xmath0 , one then has access to all thermodynamic quantities including the various interfacial tensions . calculating the grand potential",
    "as a function of the distance between the blocks yields the effective solvent mediated potential ; minus the derivative of this quantity is the solvent mediated force between the blocks .",
    "when both blocks are solvophobic _ and _ the liquid is at a state point near to bulk gas - liquid phase coexistence , we find that the solvent mediated force between these is strongly attractive at short distances due to the formation of a gas - like intrusion .",
    "proximity to coexistence can be be quantified by the difference @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the value at bulk gas - liquid coexistence . for a slit pore consisting of two parallel surfaces of infinite extent that are sufficiently solvophobic ,",
    "@xmath33 , a first order transition , namely capillary evaporation , occurs as @xmath34 , corresponding to the stabilisation of the incipient gas phase in the slit of finite width.@xcite the formation of the gas - like intrusion between the blocks that we consider here occurs at smaller @xmath35 .",
    "this is not a genuine first order surface phase transition , owing to the finite size of the blocks .",
    "however , this phenomenon is intimately related to the capillary evaporation that occurs between parallel planar surfaces with both dimensions infinite .",
    "it turns into the genuine capillary evaporation phase transition as the height of our blocks is increased to @xmath36 .",
    "note that some authors in the water community , e.g.  refs .  , and remsing _",
    "et al._,@xcite refer to this phenomenon as `` dewetting '' , but given that this term is also used to describe a film of liquid on a single planar surface breaking up to form droplets , a network pattern or other structures,@xcite we prefer to use the more accurate term , capillary evaporation .",
    "the important matter of nomenclature was emphasised in a faraday discussion on hydrophobic and structured surfaces ; see refs .  .",
    "we also present results for the local compressibility @xmath1 in the vicinity of the blocks .",
    "maxima in @xmath1 correspond to points in space where the density fluctuations are the greatest .",
    "we find that the formation of the gas - like intrusion between the hydrophobic blocks is associated with a local value of @xmath1 that is much greater than the bulk value .",
    "however , we find that the solvent density fluctuations are not necessarily at points in space that one might initially expect .",
    "for example , when there is a gas - like intrusion , the value of @xmath1 is larger at the entrance to the gap between the blocks , rather than in the centre of the gap .",
    "we are not the first to use dft to study liquids near corners and between surfaces .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite calculated the solvent mediated ( depletion ) potential between a hard - sphere colloidal particle , immersed in a solvent of smaller hard - spheres , and planar substrates or geometrically structured substrates , including a right - angled wedge .",
    "they found that in the wedge geometry there is a strong attraction of the colloid to inner corners , but there is a free energy barrier repelling the colloid from an outer corner ( edge ) of a wedge .",
    "@xcite studied the solvent mediated interaction between a spherical ( soft - core ) particle , several times larger than the ( soft - core ) solvent particles , and a planar interface .",
    "they showed that when the binary solvent surrounding the large particle ( colloid ) is near to liquid - liquid phase coexistence , thick ( wetting ) films rich in the minority solvent species can form around it and on the interface .",
    "this has a profound effect on the solvent mediated potential , making it strongly attractive . a similar effect , due to proximity to liquid - liquid phase separation , was found for the solvent mediated potential between pairs of spherical colloidal particles .",
    "@xcite analogous effects arising from proximity to gas - liquid phase coexistence , i.e.  when @xmath35 is small were found in a very recent study .",
    "@xcite such investigations , studying the influence of proximity to bulk phase coexistence on the solvent mediated potential between pairs of spherical particles , provide insight regarding what one might expect in the cases studied here , namely pairs of hydrophobic , hydrophilic and patchy blocks .    the strong attractive forces between solvophobic objects ,",
    "decreased local density and enhanced fluctuations close to the substrate , all occur when the liquid is near to bulk gas - liquid phase coexistence , i.e.  when @xmath35 is small .",
    "note that liquid water at ambient conditions is near to saturation . for water at ambient conditions @xmath37 .",
    "this dimensionless quantity provides a natural measure of over - saturation , indicating where our results might be appropriate to water and to other solvents .",
    "the other key ingredient in determining the physics of effective interactions is the liquid - gas surface tension @xmath38 , which is especially large for water .",
    "more precisely , it is the ratio @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the density of the coexisting liquid , that sets the length scale for the capillary evaporation of any liquid ; see eq .",

    "[ fig : fmt2dt80omega_xgaps1e0 ] . in this regime , treating the system using macroscopic thermodynamics , i.e.  using eq .  , turns out to be a rather good approximation for @xmath192 .",
    "although this may seem surprising , given that the blocks we consider have the microscopic cross sectional area @xmath259 , it is in keeping with recent simulation studies@xcite of water induced interactions between hydrophobes .",
    "in contrast , when both blocks are solvophilic , the potential @xmath192 is oscillatory but overall repulsive and exhibits only a weak dependence on @xmath61 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : fmt2dt80omega_xgaps1e1 ] .",
    "when the blocks are patchy , the nature of the solvent mediated potential is complex .",
    "however , we find that if solvophobic patches are present , are sufficiently large and near to one another ( facing each other on the opposing blocks ) , then their contribution to the effective potential dominates ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fmt2dt80omega_xgaprest ] ) .",
    "then the potential @xmath192 is still strongly attractive and is nearly linear in @xmath133 for small @xmath61 , particularly if the solvophobic patches are on the ends of the blocks [ see fig .",

    "6(c ) in ref .   and also",
    "moreover , it is important to note that when the sam surface is strongly hydrophobic , the solvent mediated potentials in ref .",
    "display a portion that is almost linear .",
    "hydrophobic interactions also play a role in determining the structure of proteins : simulations suggest capillary evaporation between hydrophobic patches can lead to strong forces between protein surfaces.@xcite given these observations , we expect that the results described here for a simple lj like liquid incorporate the essential physics of a realistic model of a water solvent .    in the vicinity of a single solvophobic surface the solvent density is lower , when @xmath61 is sufficiently small",

    "[ fig : fmt1dt80ew03 ] corresponding to @xmath84 .",

    "the extent of this can be large , see e.g.  fig .",
    "[ fig : fmt2d : pm3d_rho ] , and the density profile passing from the gas inside to the liquid outside of the blocks closely resembles the free gas - liquid interfacial profile  see fig .",

    "as the separation between solvophobic blocks is increased , there is a jump in the solvent mediated force when the blocks reach a particular distance , @xmath267 , where the state minimising the grand potential changes from one with a gas - like density between the blocks to one where this is liquid - like . within dft",
    "the potential @xmath192 has two branches and there is a discontinuity in the the gradient at @xmath268 ",
    "see e.g.  fig .",
    "[ fig : fmt2dt80omega_xgaps1e0 ] .",
    "we do not display the metastable portions of the branches of @xmath192 ; these do not extend very far from the crossing point indicating that the height of the nucleation barrier is small .",
    "this is due to the small size of the blocks and the small values of @xmath133 . for hydrophobic surfaces with greater surface area and at a greater distance apart",
    ", the free energy barrier should be larger ; for a recent discussion of nucleation pathways to capillary evaporation in water see ref .  .",
    "we have also studied the local compressibility @xmath1 in the liquid between and surrounding pairs of blocks of differing nature .",
    "the local compressibility exhibits pronounced peaks ; these indicate where the local density fluctuations are large .",
    "these fluctuations are maximal close to the incipient gas - liquid interface  see for example the central plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : fmt2d : pm3d_chi ] , which is for @xmath269 , and also fig .",

    "[ fig : fmt2dpm3d_xc8a ] displays how for angled blocks @xmath1 depends on alignment and the confining geometry .",
    "when pronounced fluctuations , in conjunction with a depleted surface density , are observed in simulations of water at hydrophobic interfaces , this phenomenon is often ascribed to the disruption of the water hydrogen bonding network .",
    "given that we observe similar behaviour for a simple lj like liquid close to solvophobic substrates , we argue that this phenomenon is by no means specific to water .",
    "rather it is due ( i ) to the weak bonding between the fluid and the ( solvophobic ) surface and ( ii ) the system being close to bulk gas - liquid phase coexistence , i.e.  a small value of @xmath61 .",
    "thus , since the lj like fluid considered here is representative of a broad class of simple liquids , we expect strong attraction between solvophobic surfaces , enhanced density fluctuations near such surfaces and other features of hydrophobicity to manifest themselves whenever the solvent , whatever its type , is near to bulk gas - liquid phase coexistence .",
    "there are obvious advantages , both in simulation and theory , in performing detailed investigations for simple model liquids , especially when tackling subtle questions of surface phase transitions such as critical drying.@xcite",
