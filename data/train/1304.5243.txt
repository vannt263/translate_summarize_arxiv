    "the nature of dark matter ( dm ) is one of the major mysteries in our current understanding of the universe .",
    "a comprehensive strategy encompassing direct and indirect detection plus collider searches , as well as indirect information from cosmological observations , will certainly be necessary to determine the fundamental nature of the dm .",
    "the results from the dama / libra collaboration  @xcite and , more recently , from the cogent  @xcite , cresst  @xcite and cdms  @xcite experiments , might point to the first direct signals of light weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) scattering off of nuclei @xcite .",

    ", the wmap collaboration has recently presented their 9-year data and concluded that , after combining with data from baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) , from the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) , and from the hubble space telescope ( hst ) ( @xmath0 , @xcite ) , the number of effective massless neutrinos is @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the situation is , however , quite complex and subtle when the results of other experiments are considered .",

    ", they concluded that @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "depending on the data set used , these conclusions can , however , qualitatively change .",

    "this value can , however , be much larger if one includes bao and hst data , reaching @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "it is clear that spt and act results are somewhat in tension , and this may be related to the different values used for the lensing amplitude parameter @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "lastly , the eagerly awaited planck results have just been reported . at face value ,",
    "planck data alone seem to disfavor an extra radiation component , pointing to @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "it is important to note , however , that the planck collaboration adopted fairly low values ( at the @xmath10 level ) for @xmath11 compared to previous studies @xcite .",
    "since @xmath12 and @xmath11 are positively correlated , increasing @xmath11 would naturally yield higher values for @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , adding the @xmath11 measurement and bao data , the planck collaboration finds , in fact , @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this latter value is @xmath14 above the @xmath15 value favored by big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) @xcite .    as the discussion above implies ,",
    "the best fit value for @xmath12 varies significantly depending on the data set used .",
    "regardless of that , the combined data reviewed above seem to be tentatively pointing towards the existence of an extra radiation component .",
    "interestingly , it has been shown that this additional component can be interpreted as a thermally produced light dm species @xcite , or as _ non - thermally _ produced _ relativistic _ dm particles , as shown in a model - independent way in ref .",
    "@xcite , and in the context of supersymmetric frameworks in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this article , we present a few illustrative models , including a supersymmetric example , where the tentative extra radiation component is interpreted in terms of wimp dm primarily composed of a standard cold component plus a small fraction ( roughly @xmath16 or less ) produced non - thermally in a relativistic state . in section  [ sec : derive ] we relate the energy density associated with non - thermally , relativistically produced dm with the number of effective neutrinos . in section",
    "[ sec : cosmo ] we examine the cosmological bounds from bbn , structure formation and the cmb on this scenario . in section",
    "[ sec : models ] we present four models that satify the cosmological bounds and produce @xmath17 .",
    "we summarize and conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in order to relate the energy density associated with non - thermally , relativistically produced dm with the number of effective neutrinos , we start by calculating the ratio between their respective energy densities .",
    "since the cold dark matter ( cdm ) and neutrino densities are given by @xmath18 and @xmath19 , at matter - radiation equality ( mre ) , the ratio between neutrino and dm energy density is    @xmath20    where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the number of neutrinos , and @xmath24 is the scale factor at mre .    for @xmath25 , we thus find that the energy density of one neutrino is @xmath26 of the cdm density . as a result ,",
    "if dm particles had a kinetic energy equivalent to @xmath27 at mre , this fraction would produce the same effect as an extra neutrino species in the expansion of the universe at mre , as already pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "assuming that some fraction @xmath28 of the dm in the universe is produced via the decay @xmath29 , we can relate the boost factor of the dm particle produced in the decay process ( see appendix [ boostfactor ] ) with the number of additional effective neutrinos in the universe via    @xmath30 f. \\label{deltaneff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    eq .",
    "( [ deltaneff ] ) illustrates that this scenario posseses three free parameters :    * the @xmath31 lifetime for the decay process , * the mass ratio @xmath32 , and * the fraction @xmath28 of the dm density produced via the decay .    with specific choices for the 3 parameters ,",
    "one can easily reproduce @xmath33 and therefore mimic the effect of an extra effective relativistic degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "it is important to point out that in the present setup most of the dm would still be produced thermally , for example via the standard thermal freeze - out picture , with only a small fraction being produced non - thermally and with a large kinetic energy .",
    "we show in the next section that the fraction of dm produced relativistically must be small ( @xmath34 ) due to the fact this component directly affects the formation of structure and other cosmological bounds .",
    "for example , the electromagnetic energy released in the decay could have catastrophic impacts on the abundance of light elements as synthesized in the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) framework , as well as on the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) .",
    "we analyze in detail structure formation , bbn and cmb bounds on @xmath28 and on the @xmath31 lifetime in the following section .",
    "it is well known that the primordial universe had small inhomogeneities in the density distribution of matter , which evolved linearly at first , while eventually growing non - linearly to form the structures observed today . in the standard picture of structure formation",
    ", the dark matter played a crucial role in seeding the growth of structure at an acceptable rate .",
    "a crucial ingredient to this picture is that the dm particles must have had a negligible kinetic energy at the time of structure formation . if not",
    ", the formation of structures at large scales would be slowed down because dm particles with large kinetic energies would not cluster at sufficiently small scales due to free - streaming .",
    "this slowing down the growth of structures would wash out matter density fluctuations .",
    "it is therefore critical to investigate the suppression on the growth of structure caused by the fraction of dm which is non - thermally produced in a relativistic state via the aforementioned decay process , and to derive quantitative bounds on the fraction of dm particles produced in this manner .",
    "it has been shown that , at scales above the free - streaming length , relativistic dm particles effectively behave like cold dm . at small scales ,",
    "the matter fluctuations of cold dm particles is governed by a linear equation which , during the matter - dominated stage of the universe , follows the power - law behavior @xcite @xmath35 in the equation above , @xmath36 is the growth rate of the cold dm field , which during the matter - dominated epoch is given , to first order , by @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath28 is , as above , the fraction of the dm density produced non - thermally in a relativisitic state , and where @xmath34 .",
    "it is then possible to determine the suppression on small - scales caused by the non - thermal production of relativistic dm particles by comparing the matter fluctuation given in eqs.([delta])-([alpha ] ) with the pure cold dm case at mre . to first order",

    "( [ g ] ) is applicable only in the matter - dominated regime , and a more accurate calculation considering the effects of , e.g. , a cosmological constant , is out of the scope of this work .    after combining measurements of the amplitude of matter fluctuations in the universe on scales of @xmath39  mpc from the wmap9 results @xcite with lyman - alpha forest data @xcite ,",
    "the resulting limit is @xmath40 .",
    "this limit implies , from eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) , that @xmath41 .    in summary ,",
    "structure formation constraints require that only a small fraction ( less than @xmath16 ) of the dm in the universe might have been produced in a relativistic state from a non - thermal process such as the decay we consider in the present framework .",
    "as mentioned above , the lifetime and the energy released by the mother particle @xmath31 are also constrained by bbn bounds .",
    "this is because the energy released at a given time in the history of the universe might induce electromagnetic showers that create and/or destroy light elements synthesized in the early universe @xcite . in this subsection",
    "we analyze the possible effects of this scenario on bbn .",
    "given the overall quantitative success of bbn in the `` standard cosmological model '' , the first requirement for new physics is that it not drastically alter any of the light elemental abundances such as those of d , @xmath42he , @xmath43li .",
    "energy releases which occur long after bbn may , in principle , spoil the successful bbn predictions for light elemental abundances .",
    "the energy of photons produced in late decays of @xmath44 would have been rapidly redistributed through scattering off background photons ( @xmath45 ) as well as through inverse compton scattering ( @xmath46 ) @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the constraints we obtain from bbn are , to an excellent approximation , independent of the initial energy distribution of the injected photons and are only sensitive to the _ total energy",
    "_ released in the decay process @xcite .    in order to derive bbn limits on the fraction of relativistic , non - thermally produced dm via the decay @xmath29 , we therefore need to calculate the total electromagnetic energy released .",
    "let @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the number density of particles of a particular species and @xmath49 is the number density of cmb photons , given by @xmath50 the total electromagnetic energy released from the @xmath31 decay is thus @xmath51 .",
    "if for each @xmath44 particle we have the production of a dm particle plus a photon , then @xmath52 , where @xmath53 determines the number density of particles at a time equal to the lifetime of @xmath44 , and @xmath54 is the number density of dm particles today .",

    "[ graph7 ] shows that the bbn bounds are weak for early decays because at early times the universe is hot and the initial photon spectrum is rapidly thermalized , leaving just a few high - energy photons able to modify the light elemental abundances .",
    "however , for lifetimes longer than @xmath68  s , bbn excludes most of the relevant parameter space .",
    "similar to the bbn constraints , bounds from measurements of the cmb spectrum are largely independent of the injected photon energy spectrum .",
    "these bounds also depend primarily only on the total energy release .",
    "the key effect of the additional energy injection in the form of photons is related to spectral distortions to the cmb black - body spectrum @xcite .    for times",
    "@xmath69  s the processes of bremsstrahlung , i.e. @xmath70 ( where x is an ion ) , compton scattering and double compton scattering @xmath71 quickly thermalize the injected photon energy @xcite . for @xmath72",
    "s , however , the bremsstrahlung and double compton processes become inefficient , and the photon spectrum relaxes to a bose - einstein distribution with a chemical potential ( @xmath73 ) different from zero .",
    "limits on @xmath73 can then be used to constrain this additional injected energy component .",
    "the change in the cmb spectrum caused by the energy injection is constrained by precise measurements from current satellites and telescopes . following the procedure used in ref .",
    "@xcite , we calculated the limit ( shown as a solid green curve in fig .",
    "[ graph7 ] ) imposed by cmb data on the non - thermal production of dm at a given late time . in particular , measurements of the cmb spectrum constrain any perturbation which might cause it to depart from an almost perfect blackbody spectrum .",
    "these limits are expressed in terms of deviations of the chemical potential @xmath73 from 0 .",
    "current bounds imply that @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "this upper limit can then be translated into a bound on the amount of energy released during the decay , providing a constrain on the quantity @xmath75 for a given lifetime .",
    "[ graph7 ] clearly shows that the cmb bounds become more restrictive than those from bbn for lifetimes @xmath62 longer than @xmath76  s , ruling out almost all the relevant parameter space to explain @xmath61 with relativistic non - thermally produced wimps .",
    "to summarize , we found thus far that constraints from structure formation , bbn and cmb require ( i ) @xmath77 and ( ii ) a lifetime for the mother particle @xmath31 shorter than @xmath68  s. for concreteness , we present here four example dark matter models , including a supersymmetric case , where dm particles could be partly produced non - thermally in association with a photon .",
    "we also show that these models have the potential to reproduce @xmath17 while obeying the cosmological bounds described in the previous section .",
    "unless otherwise noted , we shall use the symbol @xmath78 for the mass of the mother particle and @xmath79 for the mass of the dm particle , while we use different symbols to indicate the associated fields .    before discussing specific models , we note that , in general , we can recast eq .",
