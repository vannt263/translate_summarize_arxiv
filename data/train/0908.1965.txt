    "while the classical alexander polynomial is an invariant of the @xmath1$]-module @xmath2 , its twisted counterpart can incorporate information from any term @xmath3 of the derived series of @xmath4 . as a result , it is often a more sensitive invariant .",

    "the definition is given below .    when applied to knot groups , wada s invariant",
    "is often called the  twisted alexander polynomial \" ( twisted reidemeister torsion is a more appropriate label . see @xcite . ) a few years later , p. kirk and c. livingston , working from an algebraic topological perspective , offered another candidate for the title ( see @xcite ) .",

    "the group @xmath0 of @xmath64 has presentation @xmath123 substituting @xmath124 yields @xmath125 from which we can compute a presentation of the commutator subgroup : @xmath126 where @xmath127 .",
    "it follows immediately that @xmath128 is a cyclic group of order 3 .",
    "hence @xmath0 is a semi - direct product of @xmath129 and @xmath130 : @xmath131 consider the representation @xmath132 sending @xmath58 and @xmath133 to @xmath134 where @xmath135 is a nonzero complex number while @xmath136 is a primitive 3rd root of unity .",

    "a straightforward calculation shows that @xmath139 the alexander - lin polynomial is @xmath140 . since this is the same as @xmath141 , the wada invariant @xmath142 is equal to 1 .    in @xcite , m. suzuki showed that the braid group @xmath143 with the faithful lawrence - krammer representation also has trivial wada invariant .",
    "the group in example [ trefoil ] is well known to be isomorphic to the group of a 2-knot , the 2-twist - spun trefoil .",
    "however , neither @xmath143 nor the group in example [ trefoil ] has a presentation with deficiency 1 ( that is , one more generator than the number of relators ) .",
    "* question : * does there exist an infinite nonabelian group @xmath15 of deficiency 1 and abelianization @xmath129 together with a faithful representation @xmath144 such that the wada invariant @xmath142 is equal to 1 ?"
