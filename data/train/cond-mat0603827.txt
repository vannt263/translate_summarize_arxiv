    "the kauffman model @xcite or more generally random boolean networks have been studied in the past to describe genetic regulatory networks but are in fact very general because they do not assume any particular function of the nodes and can be applied on any topology . while in the late eighties",
    "much work has been done on the damage spreading transition renewed interest in this model has risen in the last years because of the issues of sychronisation@xcite , stability @xcite , control of chaos @xcite and investigations on scale - free topologies@xcite .",
    "a topology that is very characteristic for human networks is the small - world as introduced by watts and strogatz @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to present some numerical studies of the phase transition on the square lattice , complementing work by stauffer @xcite , and then on its small - world variant showing the appearance of a new universality class .",
    "let us first review kauffman cellular automata .",
    "the kauffman model is a random mixture of all possible booleaan rules .",
    "each of @xmath0 lattice sites hosts a boolean variable @xmath1 ( spin up or down ) which is either zero or unity .",
    "the time evolution of this model is determined by @xmath0 functions @xmath2 ( rules ) which are randomly chosen for each site independently , and by the choice of @xmath3 input sites \\{@xmath4 } for each site @xmath5 .",
    "thus the value @xmath1 at site @xmath5 for time @xmath6 + 1 is given by : @xmath7 each boolean function @xmath2 is specified , once its value is given for each of the @xmath8 possible neighbour configurations . here",
    "we are concerned with those cases where both the inputs and the chosen boolean functions do not change with time ( quenched model ) .",
    "the kauffman model has usually been considered in the last years , on one hand with an infinite range of interaction , known as the ` mean - field ' approximation @xcite in which for each site @xmath5 , the @xmath3 inputs are randomly chosen among the @xmath0 spins .",
    "such approximation was introduced to describe genetic interactions , to explain mutations and stability processes in biological genes . indeed , this was the original proposal of the kauffman model .",
    "on the other hand , this model has also been simulated on lattices with nearest - neighbour interactions , the so - called short - range case @xcite .",
    "if one considers a square lattice , as we do here , for each site @xmath5 the @xmath3 inputs are just the four nearest neighbours , thus there being @xmath9 neighbor configurations , and therefore @xmath10 different possible rules .",
    "one can implement this by introducing a probability @xmath11 of selecting a rule with the result spin up for each neighbor configuration and each lattice site . of course , because of the symmetry of boolean functions , one also has a probability 1-@xmath11 that the result is spin down .",
    "+ in the past , the connection topology had been assumed to be either completely random or completely regular .",
    "but many biological , technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes .",
    "the ` small - world ' topology seems to be very interesting for this purpose . in order to get more knowledge about this intermediate range , we interpolate between regular and random networks by starting from a square lattice with @xmath0 sites and @xmath3=4 inputs of nearest - neighbors and introducing a rewiring probability @xmath12 to each input @xmath3 connecting one site to any other , as indicated in fig.1 .",
    "dynamical systems with small - world coupling exhibit enhanced signal - propagation speed and synchronizability . in particular , small damages , for example mutations on genetic material ,",
    "spread more easily on small - world networks than on regular lattice .",
    "+ in the present work , we have performed simulations based on a parallel bit manipulation technique called _ multi - spin coding _ @xcite to attempt to determine the critical point @xmath13 in analogy to percolation , both for the short - range case ( @xmath14 ) and for the small - world case ( @xmath15 ) . to this end",
    ", we plot the normalized damage mass ( see next section ) , i.e. our order paramenter @xmath16 , versus the parameter @xmath11 .",
    "once determinated the critical points @xmath13 for each case , we evaluate the critical exponents and the fractal dimensions .",
    "[ ! l]0.48    with the objective of understanding how a single mutation spreads through genetic material , or how small hardware failures propagate on a computer architecture , we have compared two square lattices with identical sets of rules and almost identical boolean variables at each site .",
    "the only difference between them consists in a small modification of few central boolean variables ( typically less than 1% of the number of sites ) .",
    "so one can observe the time - development of the two lattices and check the difference between them after a long time for each parameter value @xmath17 .",
    "the difference between lattices is measured as the number of ` spins ' that differ between the two lattices ; this difference is also known as hamming distance @xmath18 between the lattice configurations \\{@xmath19 } and \\{@xmath20 } : @xmath21 following earlier works @xcite , we call this difference the ` damage ' . further we define here the order parameter of the system as : @xmath22 and one can also define a susceptibility as : @xmath23 it has been observed that @xmath16 as well as @xmath24 go to zero at some critical concentration @xmath25 in systems of dimensions greater than one for the short - range case kauffman model similar to the para - ferromagnetic phase transition . in other words , for all @xmath26 , a small initial damage vanishes or remains small , i.e. belongs to a small cluster of ` damaged spins ' , after a sufficiently long time .",
    "one says that the system is in the frozen phase . on the other hand , for all @xmath27 , a small initial damage spreads througout a considerable part of the system .",
    "then one says that the system is in the chaotic phase .",
    "of particular interest is , however , the border case @xmath28 where fractal properties appear ( see next section ) . to know more about phase transitions in kauffman s automata the reader should consult , for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite .    as a way to find @xmath25 in both the short - range and the small - world case",
    ", we plotted the order parameter @xmath16 versus the parameter @xmath11 for the case @xmath29(short - range ) and @xmath30 and 0.10 ( small - world ) for three different lattice sizes ( @xmath31=256 , 384 and 512 ) by flipping a small amount of regularly spaced central spins and taking an average over 100 runs for each point .",
    "everything was calculated for up to @xmath32 time - steps on an intel pentium iv processor . the updating speed using a _ multi - spin coding _",
    "algorithm on an intel machine which stores 64 spins in one computer word was about 2.44 updates per nanosecond for two configurations following the same iteration rules .",
    "our results are shown in figs . 2 and 3 , repectively for @xmath14 and @xmath30 .",
    "the transition between the frozen phase and the chaotic phase is seen to occur around @xmath33 for the case @xmath14 and around @xmath34 and @xmath35 for the cases @xmath30 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "table 1    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we estimate the critical exponents for each case by regarding the fraction of damaged sites ( @xmath16 ) on each side of the critical point after a sufficiently long time . in the chaotic range ( @xmath27 ) , this fraction goes to zero as ( @xmath37 . while in the frozen range , the ratio of the final damage to the small initial damage ( @xmath38 ) varies as ( @xmath39 . we have made a collapse of all data in order to check the consistency of the obtained results by making use of the following scaling law : @xmath40 where @xmath31 is the linear dimension of the lattice and @xmath41 is the exponent describing the divergence of the correlation length at @xmath25 .",
    "4 shows the data collapse for the case @xmath14 at @xmath42 which is in good agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite , whereas the figs .",
    "5 and 6 show the data collapse for the case @xmath43 and @xmath36 at @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively . indeed , from figs . 4 , 5 and 6 we observe that the points following the scaling relation given by eq",
    "5 have a slope of straight line equal to critical exponent @xmath44 for each case .",
    "this could be an indication of the quality of our data .",
    "we have evaluated @xmath45 by means of the eq .",
    "[ ci ] at the transition threshold @xmath25 .",
    "our estimates together with the @xmath25 values are shown in table 1 .",
    "in analogy with percolation theory , we have determined the fractal dimensions d@xmath46 and d@xmath47 both for the short - range and the small - world cases by calculating the damage mass as well as the touching time on the lattice bounderies for several lattice sizes @xmath31 at the critical point @xmath25 .",

    "@xcite we flipped a whole central line of spins at each time - step and let the system evolve until the final damage touches the lattice boundaries .",
    "our results for the touching time @xmath51 and the damage mass @xmath52 at the touching time ( averaged over 100 runs for @xmath14 and over 1000 runs for @xmath53 ) are shown as a log - log plot of time vs @xmath31 in figs . 7 and 8 ,",
    "respectively for the short - range ( @xmath14 ) and the small - world ( @xmath30 ) case .",

    "our results for the small - world case ( @xmath30 and @xmath36 ) were @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "therefore one can see easily that at @xmath15 the system no longer obeys the scaling relations of percolation .",
    "with the use of our algorithm based on the _ multi - spin coding _",
    "technique , we simulate kauffman s automata , analyzing how small central damages spread on square lattices both in the short - range case and the small - world case . in this work , we have seen that for the small - world case the speed of damage spreading is larger than for short - range case .",
    "we numerically evaluate critical exponents @xmath64 and @xmath45 for both cases .",
    "we also estimate the fractal dimension as being @xmath54 for the short - range case and @xmath65 for small - world case . where for the latter case we can no longer observe scaling relations for percolation .",
