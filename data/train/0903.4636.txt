    "let @xmath0 be a sequence of events of a stationary point process @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is a counting process ) .",
    "the simplest stationary point process is , of course , poisson process with a constant intensity @xmath3 , i.e. , the increments of @xmath4 on disjoint intervals are independent and distributed according to poisson law @xmath5 therefore if we have a stationary sequence of events it is interesting to check first of all if this model ( poisson process ) corresponds well to the observations .",
    "the importance of this problem was discussed by cox and lewis ( 1966 ) , section 6.3 .",
    "the alternatives close to the basic hypothesis correspond to the case when the non - poissonian behavior is due to small perturbations of the poisson process and are the most interesting to test . for `` far alternatives '' any reasonable",
    "test has power function close to 1 and the comparison of tests seems less important .",
    "let us consider the problem of small signals detection by the tests of fixed size @xmath6 . using the terminology of statistical radiothechnics",
    "we say that there is at least two types of close alternatives : the first one corresponds to small `` signal - noise ratio '' ( signals of small energy ) and the second , when the amplitude of the signal can be small , but the total energy due to the sufficiently long time of observation is comparable with the noise energy ( see , e.g. , kutoyants ( 1976 ) ) .",
    "for the first class of alternatives the approach of _ locally optimal tests _ , which provides the optimality of the power function at the small vicinity of the basic hypothesis ( the values of the power function are close to @xmath7 ) was developed ( see , e.g. capon ( 1961 ) ) and for the second class of _ contiguous alternatives _ the optimality of the test for a wider class of close alternatives ( the values of the power function are in @xmath8 ) is proved ( pitman s ( 1948 ) approach , le cam s ( 1956 ) theory ) .",
    "for stationary point processes with poisson hypothesis and stationary alternatives davies ( 1977 ) proposed the _ locally optimal ( efficient ) _ or _ asymptotically locally efficient _ test .",
    "this test is based on the comparison of the derivative of the log - likelihood ratio with some threshold .",
    "see as well daley and vere - jones ( 2003 ) , section 13.1 , where the approach of davies is discussed .    in the present note",
    "we suppose that we have observations of the point process @xmath9 on the interval @xmath10 $ ] and consider two problems of hypotheses testing in the asymptotics of large samples @xmath11 . in both problems",
    "the basic hypothesis is simple : the observed process is standard poisson with known constant intensity @xmath12 .",
    "the composite alternatives are : the observed process is a realization of self - exciting point process ( sometimes called hawkes ( 1972 ) process ) with in the first case intensity function depending on one - dimensional parameter and in the second case the intensity function belonging to a wider ( nonparametric ) class of functions .",
    "we follow the mentioned above pitman - le cam s approach .",
    "we start with the _ locally asymptotically uniformly most powerful test _ ( laumpt ) in the parametric case and the main result of the presented work is the laumpt where the optimality is shown for sufficiently large class of local nonparametric alternatives . the similar results for diffusion processes can be found in iacus , kutoyants ( 2001 ) ( small noise asymptotics ) and kutoyants ( 2003 ) ( ergodic processes ) .",
