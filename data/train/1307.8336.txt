    "the advent of experimental techniques like the scanning tunneling microscope and break junctions have enabled the creation of single - molecule junctions and the study of their transport properties .",
    "this has triggered the hope to use single molecules as buiding blocks in novel nanoscale electronic devices , devices that could take advantage of the unlimited physical properties of molecules . in turn , this has also given rise to the research field of _ molecular electronics _ @xcite .",
    "although there are still many basic experimental challenges to be resolved before molecular electronics can become a viable technology , it is clear by now that molecular junctions constitute an excellent playground to test basic concepts of quantum transport , which could then be applied to novel charge and energy nanoscale devices .",
    "thus for instance , the exhaustive study of electronic transport in single - molecule junctions has led to remarkable progress in the understanding of the basic mechanisms that govern the electrical conduction at the molecular scale ( for a recent review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in spite of this progress , basic aspects such as thermoelectrical properties and",
    "heat dissipation and transport in molecular junctions have remained largely unexplored due to experimental challenges @xcite . a first step towards this goal",
    "was achieved a few years ago with the first studies of thermoelectricity in molecular junctions @xcite . in particular",
    ", it has been shown that the thermopower provides useful information not contained in the standard current - voltage measurements @xcite .",
    "intense experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite study of the thermopower in molecular junctions have deepened our understanding of the charge and energy transport in these systems .",
    "the next step towards quantitative exploration of heat dissipation and conduction at the molecular scale has been taken very recently @xcite . in that work we demonstrated that it is possible to measure the heat dissipated in the electrodes of an atomic - scale junction as a result of the passage of an electrical current ( joule heating ) .",
    "further , we also highlighted the novel heat dissipation effects that arise in nanoscale systems .",
    "to elaborate , while in macroscopic wires the heat dissipation is volumetric , it is not obvious _ a priori _ how the heat is dissipated in devices of nanometric size , including molecular junctions . in most of these junctions",
    "the inelastic mean free path is larger than the characteristic device dimensions and the electrical resistance is dominated by elastic processes .",
    "thus , almost all the heat dissipation must take place inside the electrodes at a distance from the junction on the order of the inelastic scattering length . using novel scanning tunneling probes with integrated nanothermocouples ,",
    "we have been able to show that the power dissipated in the electrodes of a molecular junction is controlled by its transmission characteristics . in general , heat is not equally dissipated in both electrodes and it also depends on the bias polarity , _",
    "i.e. _  on the direction of the current",
    ".    the goal of this work is to explore in more detail the basic principles that govern the heat dissipation in molecular junctions .",
    "for this purpose , we present here a detailed theoretical analysis of the heat dissipation in these systems based on the combination of the landauer approach with _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "we pay special attention to the relation between the heating asymmetries in single - molecule junctions and their thermopower . as test systems , we study junctions based on benzene derivatives that bind to gold electrodes via different anchoring groups . for these junctions",
    ", we compare the results obtained with a transport method based on density functional theory ( dft ) with those obtained with the so - called dft+@xmath0 approach @xcite , which has been recently introduced to correct some of the known deficiencies of dft - based approaches applied to transport problems .",
    "the study presented here provides a clear guide on how to control the heat dissipation in nanoscale systems and it outlines strategies to explore fundamental issues like the peltier effect in single - molecule junctions .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec - lt ]",
    "we present a detailed discussion of the landauer theory of heat dissipation in nanoscale conductors .",
    "in particular , we discuss the basic formulas and the physical picture underlying heat dissipation in these systems .",
    "we also present some general considerations and establish the connection between heat dissipation and thermopower .",
    "moreover , we illustrate our ideas with the help of a toy model for molecular junctions .",
    "section [ sec - abinitio ] is devoted to a description of the two _ ab initio _ methods that we have employed , in combination with the landauer formalism , to describe the heat dissipation and the thermopower in single - molecule junctions . in section [ sec - mj ]",
    "we present a detailed analysis of the heat dissipation and thermopower of single - molecule junctions based on benzene derivatives with different anchoring groups .",
    "finally , we summarize in section [ sec - conclusions ] the main conclusions of our work .",
    "in the late 1950 s rolf landauer @xcite put forward a very intuitive quantum mechanical approach to describe the electronic transport in nanocircuits that has become one of the central pillars of theoretical nanoelectronics @xcite .",
    "the key idea of this approach is that if the electron transport in a nanojunction is dominated by elastic processes , it can be modeled as a scattering problem . in this problem",
    "the junction electrodes are assumed to be ideal reservoirs where electrons thermalize and acquire a well - defined temperature , while the central region plays the role of a scattering center . as a result ,",
    "all the transport properties of these systems are completely determined by the transmission function @xmath1 , which describes the total probability for electrons to cross the junction at a given energy @xmath2 when a voltage bias @xmath3 is applied across the system .",
    "landauer s original approach was extended by several authors to describe both thermal transport and thermoelectricity in nanojunctions @xcite , and in this section we explain how this approach can be used to describe heat dissipation in atomic - scale circuits .",
    "let us consider a two - terminal device with source @xmath4 and drain @xmath5 electrodes linked by a nanoscale junction @xcite .",
    "if the electron transport is elastic , _ i.e. _  if electrons flow through the device without exchanging energy in the junction region , then obviously their excess energy acquired by the application of a bias voltage must be released in the electrodes . from simple thermodynamical arguments ,",
    "the amount of heat released per unit of time in an electrode with electrochemical potential @xmath6 is given by @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the charge and energy current , respectively , and @xmath10 is the electron charge . within the landauer theory ,",
    "the electronic contribution to charge and energy currents in a two terminal device are expressed in terms of the transmission function as @xmath11 de \\\\",
    "i_e(v ) & = & \\frac{2}{h } \\int^{\\infty}_{-\\infty } e \\tau(e , v ) [ f_s(e,\\mu_s ) - f_d(e,\\mu_d ) ] de , \\label{eq - ie}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 are the fermi functions of the source or the drain and @xmath13 are the corresponding electrochemical potentials such that @xmath14 . the prefactor 2 is due to the spin degeneracy that will be assumed throughout our discussion . using equations ( [ eq - ie ] ) and ( [ eq - ie ] ) we arrive at the following expressions for the power ( heat per unit of time ) dissipated in the source and the drain electrodes @xmath15 de \\\\ q_d(v ) & = & \\frac{2}{h } \\int^{\\infty}_{-\\infty } ( e -\\mu_d ) \\tau(e , v ) [ f_s(e,\\mu_s ) - f_d(e,\\mu_d ) ] de . \\label{eq - qd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] obviously , the sum of the powers dissipated in both electrodes must be equal to the total power injected in the junction @xmath16 , as can be seen from equations ( [ eq - qs ] ) and ( [ eq - qd ] ) @xmath17   de = iv = q_{\\rm total}(v ) .\\ ] ] equations ( [ eq - qs ] ) and ( [ eq - qd ] ) are the central results of the landauer theory of heat dissipation and will be used throughout this work . given their revelance , it is worth explaining the underlying physical picture .",
    "for this purpose , we shall follow here ref .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig_hd](a ) for the case of a molecular contact , when a bias voltage is applied to a junction , the electrochemical potentials of the source and the drain are shifted .",
    "this opens up an energy window for electrons to cross the junction and it results in a net electron current in the system .",
    "let us consider an electron with an energy @xmath2 which is transmitted elastically through the junction region from the source to the drain .",
    "after reaching the drain , see figure  [ fig_hd](b ) , the electron undergoes inelastic processes ( via electron - phonon interactions ) and it decays to the electrochemical potential of the drain . in these processes , the electron releases an energy @xmath18 in the drain . on the source side , the original electron leaves behind a hole that is filled up by the same type of inelastic processes . in this way",
    ", an energy @xmath19 is dissipated in the source .",
    "notice that the overall energy dissipated in the electrodes is equal to @xmath20 , which is exactly the work done by the external battery on each charge .     is applied across the junction , the electrochemical potential of the source and drain shift such that @xmath20 .",
    "( b ) when an electron of energy @xmath2 tunnels from the source to the drain it leaves a hole behind .",
    "the electron releases its excess energy @xmath18 in the drain , while the hole is filled up dissipating an energy equal to @xmath19 in the source .",
    "( c ) if the transmission is energy - dependent and , in particular , if it is higher in the lower part of the transport window , then more power is dissipated in the source for positive bias .",
    "the transmission function is represented here by a solid line , while the arrows indicate the direction of the electron flow .",
    "the red shaded areas help to visualize the different amount of heating in the electrodes .",
    "( d ) alternatively , if the transmission is higher in the upper part of the transport window , more heat is dissipated in the drain for positive bias . ]",
    "equations ( [ eq - qs ] ) and ( [ eq - qd ] ) describe in quantitative terms the argument just expained .",
    "the energy integrals take into account the contribution of all the electrons in the transport window , the transmission function accounts for the finite probability of an electron to tunnel through the junction , and the fermi functions account for the occupation probabilities of the initial and final states in the tunneling events .",
    "in particular , the appearance of the difference of the fermi functions is a result of the net balance between tunneling processes transferring electrons from the source to the drain and from the drain to the source .",
    "the physical argument discussed above also allows us to answer in simple terms a central question in this work : is the heat equally dissipated in both electrodes ? in general , the answer is no , as we proceed to explain .",
    "let us assume that the transmission function is energy - dependent and , for instance , that the transmission is higher for energies in the lower part of the transport window , as shown in figure  [ fig_hd](c ) .",
    "as we shall discuss below , this corresponds to a situation where the transport is dominated by the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) . in this case , for a positive bias , it is obvious that a larger portion of the energy is dissipated in the source because it is more probable that electrons with a smaller excess energy tunnel through the molecule and release their energy in the drain . obviously , if we reversed the transmission landscape , see figure  [ fig_hd](d ) , the heat would be preferentially dissipated downstream following the electron flow , _",
    "i.e. _  in the drain . to conclude this subsection",
    ", we would like to remark that these arguments also make clear the fact that , in general , heat dissipation in a given electrode depends on the bias polarity , _",
    "i.e. _  it depends on the current direction .      as explained above , within the landauer approach",
    "the heat dissipated in the electrodes of a nanoscale junction is fully determined by its transmission characteristics . from equations ( [ eq - qs ] ) and ( [ eq - qd ] ) one can draw some general conclusions about the symmetry of the heat dissipation between electrodes and with respect to the bias polarity .",
    "let us first discuss under which circumstances heat is equally dissipated in both electrodes .",
    "for this purpose , we assume from now on ( without loss of generality ) that all the energies in the problem are measured with respect to the equilibrium electrochemical potential of the system , which we set to zero ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "moreover , we assume that the electrochemical potentials are shifted symmetrically with the bias voltage , _",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "this means in practice that the energy @xmath2 is measured with respect to the center of the transport window . with this choice ,",
    "the power dissipated in the source electrode is given by @xmath24 de , \\\\\\ ] ] where @xmath25 $ ] is the fermi function . using the change of variable @xmath26",
    ", the previous expression becomes @xmath27 de , \\\\\\ ] ] where we have used the relation @xmath28 .",
    "this latter equation must be compared with the corresponding expression for the power dissipated in the drain , which now reads @xmath29 de .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , we conclude that a sufficient condition to have equal heat dissipation in both electrodes , _",
    "@xmath30 , is that the transmission function fulfills that @xmath31 .",
    "this means that if the transport is electron - hole symmetric , then heat is equally dissipated in the source and in the drain .",
    "a simple corollary of this condition is that if the transmission is energy - independent in the transport window , then the power dissipation is the same in both electrodes .",
    "in particular , if the junction is ballistic , _",
    "i.e. _  if @xmath32 , @xmath33 being an integer equal to the number of open conduction channels in the system , then heat is equally dissipated in both electrodes . notice that these conclusions can be also drawn from the handwaving arguments explained at the end of the previous subsection",
    ".    another crucial question that can be answered in general terms is : does the power dissipated in a given electrode depend on the bias polarity ( or current direction ) ? with manipulations similar to those of the previous paragraph ,",
    "it is straighforward to show that @xmath34 if @xmath35 is satisfied .",
    "this means , in particular , that if the transmission does not depend significantly on the bias voltage , the power dissipated in an electrode is independent of the bias polarity as long as there is electron - hole symmetry . obviously , if the transmission is independent of both the energy and the bias , then the heating is symmetric with respect to the inversion of the bias polarity .",
    "again , this is what occurs in any ballistic structure .    on the other hand",
    ", one can also show that the relation @xmath36 is satisfied if @xmath37 .",
    "this relation implies the following one : @xmath38 .",
    "this means that if the transmission is symmetric with respect to the inversion of the bias voltage , then the sum of the dissipated powers for positive and negative bias in a given electrode is equal to the total power dissipated in the junction .",
    "this relation is then expected to hold for left - right symmetric junctions , where the voltage profile is inversion symmetric with respect to the center of the junction .    from the general considerations above ,",
    "it is clear that in order to have a heating asymmetry of the type @xmath39 or @xmath40 , one needs a certain degree of electron - hole asymmetry in the transmission function .",
    "this can be seen explicitly by expanding equations ( [ eq - qssym ] ) and ( [ eq - qdsym ] ) to first order in the bias voltage , which leads to the following expression @xmath41 here , @xmath42 is the linear electrical conductance of the junction , @xmath43 is the absolute temperature , and @xmath4 is the thermopower or seebeck coefficient of the junction . let us remind that in the landauer approach @xmath42 and @xmath4 can be expressed in terms of the zero - bias transmission as @xmath44 \\ ; de , \\\\ s & = & -\\frac{1}{et } \\frac { \\int^{\\infty}_{-\\infty } e \\tau(e , v=0 ) [ -\\partial f(e , t)/ \\partial e ] \\ ; de } { \\int^{\\infty}_{-\\infty } \\tau(e , v=0 ) [ -\\partial f(e , t)/ \\partial e ] \\ ; de}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equation ( [ eq - qsd1st ] ) can also be written in the familiar form : @xmath45 @xcite , where @xmath46 is the peltier coefficient of the junction and @xmath47 is the electrical current in the linear regime . moreover , from equation ( [ eq - qsd1st ] ) we can conclude that @xmath48 _ i.e. _  _ the heating asymmetries between electrodes and with respect to the bias polarity are determined to first order in the bias by the seebeck coefficient of the junction_.    on the other hand , using the low temperature expansion of @xmath42 and @xmath4 @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the energy derivative of the zero - bias transmission at the fermi energy , @xmath51 , we arrive at the following expression for the linear voltage term of the power dissipations at low temperature @xmath52 thus , we see that the slope of the transmission function at the fermi energy determines not only the thermopower , but also the magnitude and the sign of the heating asymmetry to the lowest order in the bias .",
    "equation ( [ eq - qsd1st ] ) implies that at sufficiently low bias , and if the thermopower is finite , one of the electrodes may be cooled down by the passage of an electrical current ( peltier effect ) .",
    "how low must the voltage be to observe this cooling effect ? to answer this question we need to consider the quadratic term of @xmath53 in the bias .",
    "( notice that a quadratic term must exist in order to satisfy energy conservation , @xmath54 , since at low bias @xmath55 . ) if for simplicity we ignore the bias depedence of the transmission function , it is easy to see that the second - order term of @xmath53 is given by @xmath56 , which is equal to half of the total power in the linear regime .",
    "this second - order term dominates over the linear one , see equation ( [ eq - qsd1st ] ) , when @xmath57 ( above this bias , each electrode is heated up by the current ) .",
    "thus for instance , if we assume room temperature ( @xmath58 k ) and a typical value of @xmath59 @xmath6v / k @xcite , then the second - order term dominates the contribution to the heating for voltages @xmath60 mv .",
    "this means in practice that in most molecular junctions we expect joule heating to dominate over peltier cooling over a wide range of bias .",
    "of course , at a sufficiently high bias , higher order terms in the voltage expansion ( beyond the quadratic one ) may give a significant contribution to the power dissipation in a given electrode . in any case , all those non - linear contributions can be taken into account by using the full expressions for the power dissipated , see equations ( [ eq - qssym ] ) and ( [ eq - qdsym ] ) .      in order to illustrate",
    "some of the ideas discussed in the previous subsections and to gain some further insight , we analyze in this subsection the heat dissipation in molecular junctions with the help of a single - level model , sometimes refer to as _ resonant tunneling model _ @xcite . in this model",
    "one assumes that transport through a molecular junction is dominated by a single molecular orbital ( typically the homo or the lumo ) and the transmission function is given by @xmath61 here , @xmath62 is the energetic position of the molecular level measured with respect to the fermi energy ( set to zero ) and @xmath63 is the strength of the metal - molecule coupling ( or equivalently the level broadening ) . for simplicity",
    ", we assume here that the junction is symmetric , _",
    "i.e. _  the molecule is equally coupled to both electrodes .",
    "let us remind that in this model the parameter @xmath63 is taken as a constant ( energy - independent ) , which means that local density of states in the metal electrodes is assumed to be constant in the energy range involved in the transport window .",
    "let us also recall that in the symmetric case considered here , the level position does not depend on the bias and the transmission function is thus independent of the applied voltage .    within this model ,",
    "the power dissipated in the source and in the drain electrodes is obtained by substituting equation ( [ eq - tauslm ] ) into equations ( [ eq - qssym ] ) and ( [ eq - qdsym ] ) . since the transmission does not depend explicitly on the bias voltage , the following two relations are satisfied ( see subsection [ sec - gc ] ) @xmath64 the first relation tells us that the power dissipated in one of the electrodes can be obtained from the power dissipated in the other one by simply inverting the bias .",
    "the second relation implies that the sum of the power dissipated for positive and negative bias in a given electrode is equal to the total power dissipated in the junction .",
    "ev and @xmath65 mev .",
    "( b ) the corresponding current - voltage characteristics .",
    "( c ) half of the total power dissipated in the junction and the power dissipated in the source as a function of the bias .",
    "( d ) the power dissipated in the source as a function of the total power for positive and negative bias .",
    "the dashed line correspond to the power dissipated in a symmetric situation , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath66 . in panels (",
    "b - d ) the results were obtained assuming room temperature . ]",
    "let us now use this model to simulate a junction where the transport is dominated by the lumo . for this purpose ,",
    "we choose @xmath67 ev ( level above the fermi energy ) and @xmath65 mev . with these values",
    "the transmission at the fermi energy is @xmath68 . in figure [ fig_slm_lumo ]",
    "we show for this example the transmission as a function of energy ( panel a ) , the current - voltage ( i - v ) characteristics ( panel b ) , the total power and power dissipated in the source as a function of the bias ( panel c ) , and the power dissipated in the source as a function of the total power for both positive and negative bias ( panel d ) .",
    "the voltage range in panels b and c has been chosen as to describe the typical regime explored in most experiments in which the highest bias is not sufficient to reach the resonant condition @xmath69 .",
    "the results of panels b - d have been calculated a room temperature ( 300 k ) , but in this off - resonant situation the corresponding results at zero temperature are similar ( not shown here ) .",
    "the main conclusion of these results is that , as it can be clearly seen in panel d , the power dissipated in the source for negative bias is higher than for positive bias ( the situation is the opposite in the drain ) .",
    "according to equation ( [ eq - qsdasym2 ] ) , this fact is due to the negative value of the seebeck coefficient , or equivalently to the positive slope of the transmission at the fermi energy , see equation ( [ eq - qsdlowtv ] ) . in this case , the non - linearities of the i - v curve are reflected in the fact that the total power contains a significant quartic term ( @xmath70 ) and the bias asymmetry in the power dissipated in the source , @xmath71 , contains a significant cubic term ( @xmath72 ) and even higher order ones .    to illustrate how the sign of the seebeck coefficient is closely related to the asymmetries in the heat dissipation",
    ", we now investigate a case where we just change the sign of @xmath62 with respect to the previous example .",
    "this case corresponds to a situation where the transport is dominated by the homo .",
    "the corresponding results are shown in figure [ fig_slm_homo ] .",
    "as one can see , while the i - v curve is exactly the same as in the previous case , now a higher power is dissipated in the source for positive bias contrary to the example in figure [ fig_slm_lumo ] .",
    "these results nicely illustrate how the heat dissipation can be controlled by tuning the thermopower of the junctions : the power dissipation is always higher in the electrode with the highest electrochemical potential if the level lies below the fermi level ( in equilibrium ) , while it is higher in the electrode with the lowest electrochemical potential if the level is above it .     for @xmath73 ev .",
    "]    the relation between @xmath74 and @xmath75 is particularly useful to visualize the heating asymmetries ( both between electrodes and with respect to the bias polarity ) . in this sense , it is interesting to analyze to what extent this relation depends on variations of the parameters of the model . in this analysis",
    "we focus on the case of off - resonant transport , which is the most common situation in the experiments . in figure",
    "[ fig_slm_eps](a ) we show this relation for @xmath65 mev and different values of the level position ranging from 0.4 to 1.4 ev .",
    "notice that in all cases we are in the off - resonant regime ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "as one can see , the @xmath74-@xmath75 relation is rather insensitive to variations in the level position , in spite of the fact that the linear conductance changes by up to an order of magnitude . in figure [ fig_slm_eps](b )",
    "we explore how this relation depends on the coupling strength . for this purpose ,",
    "we have fixed the level position to @xmath67 ev and varied @xmath63 between 20 and 60 mev .",
    "notice that the relation between the powers is more sensitive to variations in @xmath63 , but again the variations are relatively small taking into account that the conductance has been varied by a factor of 10 .",
    "-@xmath75 relation is shown for @xmath65 mev and different values of the level position , as indicated in the legend .",
    "( b ) the same relation for @xmath77 ev and different values of the coupling strength . in both panels ,",
    "the corresponding values of the transmission at the fermi energy are indicated in the legend .",
    "all the results were obtained at room temperature . ]    now , let us try to shed some more light on the insensitivity of the @xmath74-@xmath75 relation to variations of the junction parameters in an off - resonant transport situation . for this purpose , we have carried out analytical calculations in the limit of zero temperature , which are also applicable to finite temperatures in an off - resonant situation . from equations ( [ eq - qssym ] ) , ( [ eq - qdsym ] ) , and ( [ eq - tauslm ] ) , it is straightforward to show that @xmath78 + \\arctan \\left [ \\frac{ev/2+\\epsilon_0}{\\gamma } \\right ] \\right\\ } - \\\\",

    "thus , the total power can be written in this limit as @xmath79 while the heating asymmetry adopts the form @xmath80 here , @xmath42 is the linear conductance , which in the off - resonant limit reads @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the conductance quantum .",
    "if we now restrict ourselves to the low - bias limit where the total power is quadratic ( @xmath83 ) , then the power dissipated in the source can be expressed as @xmath84 $ ] @xmath85 this expression shows that the relation between @xmath74 and @xmath75 is independent of the level position in an off - resonant situation .",
    "notice that the level position only enters via its sign ( positive for lumo - dominated cases and negative for homo - dominated ones ) .",
    "this analytical expression nicely illustrates the insensitivity of this relation to the level position found in the numerical results above .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , within the landauer approach all the transport properties are determined by the transmission characteristics of the junctions .",
    "thus , in order to describe realistic systems , we need microscopic methods to compute these characteristics . in this section",
    "we discuss the two _ ab initio _ methods that we have employed in this work to compute the transmission through molecular junctions and , in turn , to study the corresponding heat dissipation .",
    "the goal of this subsection is to describe the first _ ab initio _ method , which is based on density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "this dft - based transport method has been described in great detail in ref .",
    "@xcite and therefore , our discussion here will be rather brief . this method is built upon the quantum - chemistry code turbomole @xcite .",
    "a central issue in our approach is the description of the electronic structure of the junctions within dft . in all the calculations presented here",
    "we have used the bp86 exchange - correlation functional @xcite and the gaussian basis set def - svp @xcite .",
    "the total energies were converged to a precision of better than @xmath86 atomic units , and structure optimizations were carried out until the maximum norm of the cartesian gradient fell below @xmath87 atomic units . in what follows , we shall discuss the two main steps in our method : ( i ) construction of the geometries of the single - molecule junctions and ( ii ) determination of the electronic structure of the junctions and calculation of the transmission function using green s function techniques .",
    "in the construction of the junction geometries we proceed as follows .",
    "we first place the relaxed molecule in between two gold clusters with 20 ( or 19 ) atoms .",
    "subsequently , we perform a new geometry optimization by relaxing the positions of all the atoms in the molecule as well as the four ( or three ) gold atoms on each side that are closest to it , while the other gold atoms are kept fixed . afterwards , the size of the gold cluster is increased to about 63 atoms on each side in order to describe correctly both the metal - molecule charge transfer and the energy level alignment .",
    "finally , the central region , consisting of the molecule and one or two au layers on each side , is coupled to ideal gold surfaces , which serve as infinite electrodes and are treated consistently with the same functional and basis set within dft .",
    "region and two semi - infinite @xmath88 and @xmath89 electrodes . using a similar division for the ecc ( b ) , information on the electronic structure of the @xmath90 region ( @xmath91 ) as well as the @xmath92 and @xmath93 couplings ( @xmath94 and @xmath95 ) is extracted . the electrode surface green s functions @xmath96 and @xmath97 , needed for the computation of the self - energies @xmath98 and @xmath99 [ equation  ( [ eq : sigma_x ] ) ] , are determined in a separate calculation @xcite . ]    to determine the electronic structure of the infinite junctions and to compute the transmission characteristics we make use of a combination of green s function techniques and the landauer formula expressed in a local nonorthogonal basis .",
    "briefly , the local basis allows us to partition the basis states into @xmath88 , @xmath90 , and @xmath89 ones , according to the division of the contact geometry , see figure  [ fig_method_geom ] .",

    "this method is known as self - energy corrected density functional theory dft+@xmath0 and it is an extension of the dft method that has been introduced to cure some of its known deficiencies @xcite .",

    ", dft tends to underestimate the homo - lumo gap , which in the context of molecular transport junctions implies that this method tends to systematically overestimate the conductance .",
    "the dft+@xmath0 approach , which we describe in this subsection , has been shown to improve the agreement with the experiments for both conductance and thermopower @xcite .    in our implementation of the dft+@xmath0 method we have followed ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "this method aims at constructing accurate quasiparticle energies and starts by correcting the dft - based energy levels of the gas phase molecules . to be precise , the homo energy is shifted such that it corresponds to the negative ionization potential ( ip ) , while the lumo is shifted to agree with the negative electron affinity ( ea ) .",
    "all other energies of occupied ( unoccupied ) levels are shifted uniformly by the same amount as the homo ( lumo ) .",
    "the ip and ea are computed within dft from total energy calculations as follows @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the total energy of the neutral molecule and @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) is the total energy of the molecule with one electron removed ( or added ) .",

    "the fact that the dft and dft+@xmath0 results agree and that the relation between the power disspations does not depend significantly on the junction geometry is a nice illustration of one of the central conclusions in subsection [ sec - slm ] , namely that this relation is quite insensitive to the level alignment in off - resonant situations like the one realized in these au - bda - au junctions .",

    "following the same analysis as for bda , we have first investigated the most probable geometries of the au - bdnc - au junctions and we have found that the isonitrile group binds also preferentially to single low - coordinated gold atoms in atop positions . this is in agreement with previous studies of adsorption of isocyanides on gold surfaces @xcite .",

    ", we have also included the experimental results of ref .",
    "the main conclusions from these results are the following .",
    "first , a higher power is dissipated in the source electrode for negative bias , in strong constrast to the bda case .",
    "this is due to the fact that the slope of the transmission at the fermi energy is positive , which leads to a negative value for the thermopower .",
    "second , both methods produce similar results for the relation between the power dissipations , in spite of the big differences in their low - bias conductances . again , this is a consequence of the insensitivity of this relation to the exact level alignment in an off - resonant situation .",
    "third , the theoretical results reproduce qualitatively the experimental findings .",
    "fourth , the heating assymetries are more pronounced than in the bda case .",
    "this is due to the larger seebeck coefficient in the case of bdnc .    . for clarity ,",
    "the position of the fermi level is indicated by dashed vertical lines .",
    "( e - f ) the corresponding results for the power dissipated in the source electrode , for positive and negative biases , as a function of the total power dissipated . ]    the calculations discussed so far , and their agreement with the experiments , provide strong evidence of the relationship between the sign of the thermopower and the heating asymmetries . to provide further evidence ,",
    "we have also investigated single - molecule junctions based on benzenedithiol ( bdt ) and benzenedinitrile ( bdcn ) .",
    "following the classification in terms of hammett constants @xcite , the amine group is strongly electron - donating , thiol is weakly electron - withdrawing , and nitrile and isonitrile are both strongly electron - withdrawing . in this sense",
    ", the naive expectation is that the thermoelectricity and the heat dissipation in au - bdt - au and au - bdcn - au junctions may be similar to those in au - bda - au and au - bdnc - au , respectively .",
    "let us show that this is indeed the case . in figure [ fig_heat_bdt - bdcn ] we depict the results for the transmission functions and the power dissipations for the two geometries of the upper panels .",
    "the main features of these results are the following . in the case of bdt",
    ", transport is dominated by the homo , the thermopower is positive , and there is higher power dissipation in the source electrode for positive bias than for negative bias .",
    "these results are indeed very similar to those obtained for the au - bda - au junctions .",

    "@xcite .",
    "the results for the au - bdcn - au junction of figure [ fig_heat_bdt - bdcn](b ) show that the transport in this case is dominated by the lumo , which leads to a negtive seebeck coefficient and a higer power dissipation in the source electrode for negative bias , _ i.e. _  very much like in the case of au - bdnc - au junctions . again , in this case the results obtained with dft+@xmath0 predict a much lower conductance than the dft method , see table  [ table2 ] . in this case",
    ", the difference between these methods for the power dissipation is more significant , as one can see in figure [ fig_heat_bdt - bdcn](f ) .",
    "the difference is particularly clear at low bias , where the dft method predicts a small negative power ( cooling effect ) for positive bias .",
    "this result is most likely an artifact of the position of the lumo , which lies very close to the fermi energy resulting in a very large and negative thermopower , see table  [ table2 ] .",

    "our analysis also provides simple guidelines for future studies of related phenomena such as the peltier effect in molecular junctions @xcite . in all the junctions studied in this work ,",

    "it would also be interesting to explore the heat dissipation in situations where quantum interferences are expected to give rise to anomalously large values of the thermopower @xcite .",
    "another interesting possiblity is to use semiconducting electrodes where the gap may help to remove hot electrons and thus to cool down one the electrodes , as it has been demonstrated in hybrid superconducting systems in mesoscopic physics @xcite .",
