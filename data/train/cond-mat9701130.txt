    "recent advance in the field of high - temperature superconductivity , in particularly discovery of strong anisotropy of the order parameter , stimulated new interest to the old problem of the effect of ( magnetic and non - magnetic ) impurity scattering on superconductivity with high anisotropy . in a number of theoretical papers published within the last few years",
    "qualitatively new phenomena were uncovered @xcite .",
    "moreover , detailed experimental studies of the effect of impurities in high - temperature superconductors are underway ( see e.g. refs . and references therein ) .",
    "a specific , but representative case of anisotropic superconductivity is multiband superconductivity ( e.g. , ref . ) , where the order parameter is different in different bands .",
    "allen showed in 1978@xcite ( see also ref . )",
    "that a superconductor with a general anisotropy can be treated within the same mathematical formalism as a multiband superconductor , if one expands the order parameter , pairing interaction , and impurity scattering in terms of the fermi surface harmonics . in this paper",
    "we derive a general formula , analogous to the abrikosov - gorkov formula for isotropic superconductors @xcite , but valid for an arbitrary multiband system . according to the allen s formalism ,",
    "this result is easily generalizable to superconductivity with arbitrary angular anisotropy .",
    "we will also show explicit results for various limiting cases to illustrate the physics of the interplay between impurity scattering and gap function anisotropy .",
    "we will illustrate the results on a model system with strong interband anisotropy , namely one where superconductivity in one of two bands is induced by interband proximity effect .",
    "following the standard way of including the impurity scattering in the bcs theory@xcite , one writes the equations for the renormalized frequency @xmath1 and order parameter @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the matsubara index ) , which completely define the superconductive properties of the system :    @xmath4    the general form of these equations for strong coupling and general anisotropy in terms of the fermi surface harmonics can be found in ref .",
    "note that according to allen s terminology we work in the disjoint representation , where fermi surface harmonics are defined separately for each sheet of the fermi surface , and take into account only the lowest harmonic for each sheet .",
    "other notations in eqs.1 have their usual meaning : @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the scattering rate matrix due to nonmagnetic impurities , and @xmath8@xmath9 is the same for magnetic impurities . the coupling matrix @xmath10 is defined in the same way as allen s matrix @xmath11 @xcite , @xmath12 . here",
    "@xmath13 is the partial density of states at the fermi level in the band @xmath14 the scattering potential @xmath15 and the pairing potential @xmath16 are symmetric matrices , while @xmath17 and @xmath10 are not .",
    "we shall also introduce the following useful notations :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the total density of states , @xmath20 are partial electron - phonon coupling constants , which define the electron mass renormalization in the band @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the total isotropic coupling constant , which enters the bcs and eliashberg equation for isotropic constant gap superconductivity .",
    "analogously , we shall introduce partial scattering rates , @xmath23    at temperatures close to @xmath0 one can linearize eqs .",
    "1 with respect to @xmath24 . to do so ,",
    "we introduce , as usual , the renormalization function @xmath25 and the gap function @xmath26 @xmath27    @xmath28    which we can solve for @xmath29 @xmath30 now from eq.[ag3 ] follows that @xmath31 for weak ( @xmath32 ) and for intermediate ( @xmath33 ) scattering the usual trick with subtracting the clean limit , @xmath34 , can be applied , and extending summation to infinity ( a useful matrix formula is @xmath35 , one gets @xmath36\\delta _ \\gamma ; \\,\\,\\,x_{\\alpha \\beta } = 2\\pi t_c\\sum_n\\sum_\\gamma ( g_{\\gamma \\beta } ^{+}/2)\\omega _ n^{-1}(\\omega _ n\\delta _ { \\alpha \\gamma } + g_{\\alpha \\gamma } ^{+}/2)^{-1 } ,   \\label{x}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the euler constant .",
    "by introducing the eigensystem of @xmath38 , @xmath39 we can express @xmath40 in terms of the difference between the two incomplete gamma - functions ( @xmath41 : @xmath42 with @xmath43 , which is the standard definition of the matrix function @xmath44    this result is analogous to the classic one of abrikosov and gorkov@xcite ( ag ) , but includes arbitrary anisotropy . now solving ( [ x ] ) for @xmath45",
    ", we find : @xmath46 which means that now @xmath0 is defined by the _ effective _ matrix @xmath47 as it is well known in the multiband superconductivity theory@xcite , in this case @xmath0 is defined by the usual bcs equation , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the maximal eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath10 ( in our case , of the matrix @xmath50 as can be seen immediately from eqs.([x]-[last ] ) and the definition of @xmath51 , diagonal nonmagnetic scattering rates @xmath52 have dropped out from eq.[last ] .",
    "this is the manifestation of the anderson theorem for a many band case : intraband scattering does not influence @xmath0 ( in the considered born limit ) .",
    "as will be discussed below , this argument works only for the intraband non - magnetic scattering , while all other are , in principle , pair - breaking .    up to the second order in @xmath10",
    "( assuming that @xmath53 is small ) , @xmath54 if we recall that @xmath55 forms the eigenvector of @xmath10 corresponding to its maximal eigenvalue @xmath56 , we can immediately write the lowest - order correction to @xmath56 : @xmath57 in the strong scattering case ( @xmath58 this formalism can not be used .",
    "instead , one should use eq.[sum ] directly .",
    "let us consider explicitly some interesting limiting cases . for weak scattering ( @xmath59 one can use eq.[dlambdaeff ] , and expand @xmath60 and write @xmath61 when all @xmath55 s are equal ( isotropic case ) ,",
    "the standard abrikosov - gorkov result is recovered : @xmath62 , that is , non - magnetic scattering falls out . on the other hand , in anisotropic case only the intraband non - magnetic scattering",
    "falls out of eq .",
    "[ weak ] , as for instance in a two - band case :    @xmath63}{% 8t_c(\\delta _ 1 ^ 2+\\delta _ 2 ^ 2)}.   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the main point of the ag theory@xcite is that @xmath64@xmath65 enters equations for @xmath66 and @xmath55 with opposite signs .",
    "that is why the magnetic impurities appear to be pair - breakers , and the non - magnetic ones not .",
    "the above solution shows explicitly that in the multiband case of eqs.1 only intraband non - magnetic scattering does not influence @xmath0 ( @xmath67 drop out ) . in an interesting limit of two bands , in which one band is",
    "superconducting and another is not , @xmath68 it follows from eq .",
    "[ weak2 ] that @xmath69 where the first term is the usual ag @xmath0-suppression , and the last two show that the pair - breaking influence of the non - superconducting band is the same both for magnetic and nonmagnetic scattering . however , the sign of the order parameter , induced in the second band , is different : the same for nonmagnetic and the opposite for magnetic scattering ( cf .",
    "the @xmath70 curves in fig.[inducedgaps ] ) .",
    "such sign reversal is discussed in more detail later in the paper .    in the next order in @xmath71 the additional correction to @xmath72",
    "is ( @xmath73/(\\lambda _ { 11}-\\lambda _ { 22})$ ] ( this corresponds to the so - called interband tunneling , specific cases of which are considered in the literature @xcite ) . in the limit of @xmath74",
    "the above expression coincides with that derived in ref .. since @xmath75 , the last expression can also be written as @xmath76 note that if @xmath77 suppression of @xmath0 is independent of @xmath78 as long as @xmath79 it is clearly seen , for instance , in the left - hand part of fig.[tcimp ] , where the suppression rate for @xmath77 and various @xmath80 is shown , and is practically independent on @xmath81 for producing this figure we have solved eqs . 1 numerically for two bands , assuming @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath84 and @xmath85 in full agreement with eqs.[fig1],[tc1 ] @xmath86 is first suppressed linearly with the rate @xmath87 then , at @xmath88 it starts to deviate from linearity , and as it will be proved later in the paper , saturates at some value depending on @xmath89    another important limiting case , also often considered in the literature , is the limit of the weak anisotropy .",
    "let us assume that @xmath90 where @xmath91 the pair - breaking effect of magnetic impurities is then given by the isotropic ag theory , so it is sufficient to consider only non - magnetic scattering .",
    "let us also take , for simplicity , an isotropic scattering , @xmath92 .",
    "then eq.[weak ] gives :    @xmath93    where @xmath94 is the total non - magnetic scattering , summed over all bands ( or fermi harmonics ) .",
    "thus in case of weak anisotropy the @xmath0 suppression is given by the ag formula with an effective scattering rate @xmath95 .",
    "this result has often been obtained for the angular gap anisotropy @xcite .",
    "returning to the two - band case , we observe that eq.[last ] is invariant with respect to simultaneous change of signs of @xmath96 and @xmath97 and interchange of nondiagonal magnetic and nonmagnetic scattering @xmath98 @xmath99 .",
    "this remarkable property is the consequence of the symmetry of the matrix @xmath100 with respect to the above transformations with simultaneous reversal of the relative signs of the order parameters @xmath101 one manifestation of this phenomenon is discussed above for induced superconductivity .",
    "another illustration is given by the symmetric case @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "then it follows from eq .",
    "[ last ] that with sign change of @xmath104 the role of magnetic and nonmagnetic interband scattering is completely reversed .",
    "namely , for positive @xmath104 ( @xmath105 and @xmath106 have the same signs ) only magnetic interband scattering suppresses @xmath0 according to @xmath107 . in the opposite case of negative @xmath104 ( @xmath105 and",
    "@xmath106 have different signs ) the magnetic impurities do not influence @xmath0 but the nonmagnetic ones suppress it according to @xmath108 . the case of arbitrary @xmath109 is shown in fig.[inducedgaps ] , where we show the numerical solution of eqs.1 for the same model as we used in fig.[tcimp ] : @xmath110 is fixed , and @xmath80 changes from 0 to 0.4 .",
    "both magnetic ( @xmath111 @xmath112 and non - magnetic ( @xmath113 @xmath114 impurities are considered . in the first band",
    "the order parameter is suppressed equally by magnetic and nonmagnetic impurities : the solid curves in fig.[inducedgaps ] are the same for both cases .",
    "the order parameter in the second band has the same absolute value for pure magnetic or for pure nonmagnetic scattering , but its sign is different in the two cases .",
    "moreover , even if @xmath115 but @xmath116 , there still is a possibility of the interband sign reversal of the gap due to magnetic impurities .",
    "this happens when nondiagonal elements in the effective @xmath10 matrix in eq.[last ] become negative : @xmath117 which does happen if @xmath118 is sufficiently large .",
    "then the order parameters in different bands have different signs , i.e. solution with sign@xmath119sign@xmath120 corresponds to a minimum energy .",
    "this sign reversal leads to an interesting effect : if one starts from a pure superconductor with weak interband coupling , and suppresses @xmath0 by adding interband magnetic impurity scattering , at some critical scattering strength suppression rate drops drastically .",
    "the final comment to fig.[inducedgaps ] is that it shows either solely magnetic , or solely nonmagnetic scattering .",
    "when both kinds of scattering are present , the order parameter in the second band is much smaller than in the either pure case , and becomes zero when magnetic and nonmagnetic scattering are equally strong .",
    "numerical illustration of this effect can be found in ref .",
    "this situation is closely analogous to the known case of _ d_-pairing , where isotropic non - magnetic impurity scattering leads to an ag @xmath0 suppression , but with a factor of two smaller coefficient ( cf",
    ". refs . ) .",
    "if we label those parts of the fermi surface that have positive order parameter as 1 and those which have negative order parameter as 2 , then only in the `` interband channel '' the nonmagnetic impurities are pair - breaking , while the magnetic impurities are pair - breaking only in the `` intraband channel '' .",
    "correspondingly , the effective pair - breaking scattering rate will be @xmath121 note that isotropic magnetic scattering results in exactly as much pair - breaking in terms of @xmath0 as isotropic non - magnetic scattering , contrary to the popular misconception that only nonmagnetic impurities are suppressing @xmath0 in @xmath122wave superconductors .",
    "interestingly , if isotropic magnetic and non - magnetic scattering are both present , and have equal strength , @xmath0 suppression rate is the same for the @xmath123 and @xmath122wave superconductors . if only magnetic scattering is present , @xmath0 is suppressed twice faster in an @xmath124-superconductor . in fact , most of these statements are not specific for the @xmath125-pairing , but are true for any superconductor with zero average order parameter and non - zero average square for the order parameter .",
    "let us , for example , prove that in such a superconductor isotropic magnetic and non - magnetic scatterings both have the same effect on @xmath126 according to eq . [",
    "weak ] , @xmath0 suppression rate is proportional to @xmath127 where we used * k * and @xmath128 for indices to emphasize that the formalism is valid both for interband or for angular anisotropy . for isotropic scattering ,",
    "@xmath129 @xmath130 this equation reduces to    @xmath131 for isotropic @xmath124-wave superconductors , @xmath132 and the @xmath0 suppression rate does not depend on @xmath133 for a superconductor where @xmath134 @xmath135 a specific case of which is a @xmath136-wave superconductor , the suppression rate is proportional to @xmath137 as we have conjectured before .",
    "let us now go beyond the weak scattering limit , so that we can not any more use the expansion in @xmath138 in eq.[last ] . in accordance with the ag result",
    ", the critical temperature vanishes at some finite rate of intraband magnetic scattering @xmath139 .",
    "the situation is qualitatively different with respect to interband scattering .",
    "we will show that in the strongly anisotropic case of @xmath140 the critical temperature does not vanish even in the regime of very strong interband scattering .",

    ", we have to go back to eq . [ sum ] .",
    "this equation can be solved analytically in an important regime of the isotropic superstrong interband scattering , @xmath157 . in this regime , @xmath158 where @xmath159 to handle eq .",
    "[ sum ] we first need to transform the matrix @xmath160^{-1}=(2\\omega _",

    "expanding the square bracket in series in @xmath161 and collecting the appropriate terms , we observe that @xmath162 which in the sought limit @xmath163 is simply @xmath164 thus @xmath165 which has the solution @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the mass renormalization parameter , and the average gap @xmath168 satisfies the regular bcs equation with the isotropically averaged coupling : @xmath169 so , in the superstrong coupling regime @xmath0 saturates at a limiting value , which is actually the critical temperature calculated in fully isotropic bcs theory .",
    "this regime corresponds to the so - called cooper limit investigated previously for the proximity - effect coupled systems @xcite .",
    "note that the order parameters in the individual bands are nevertheless different , specifically , @xmath170 this does not mean that the observable zero - temperature gaps are going to be different .",
    "in fact , they are the same , as discussed in the next section and illustrated on fig .",
    "[ dos ] .",
    "we illustrate the above discussion of the @xmath0 suppression by a numerical solution of the eqs.[sum ] for a two - band case with strong interband anisotropy and @xmath171 , @xmath172 , corresponding to equal densities of states in the two bands @xmath173 . we have chosen @xmath174 , @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "the results of calculations of @xmath0 vs @xmath177 are shown in fig.[tcimp ] for various values of @xmath178 . in accordance with the above analytical results , @xmath0 first drops steeply as @xmath177 increases and then saturates at some finite value when @xmath179 the saturation value depends on @xmath178 in accordance with eq.[lam - strong ] . the suppression of @xmath0 remains the same when nonmagnetic scattering is zero , @xmath180 , but @xmath118 is finite , except that the order parameter @xmath181 has the sign opposite to that of @xmath182 , as discussed above and illustrated on fig.[inducedgaps ] . both kinds of impurities , @xmath118 and @xmath177 , suppress the critical temperature in this case according to eqs.[tc1]-[lam - strong ] .",
    "the discussion of the critical temperature suppression was based on the solutions of the linearized equations . to obtain the density of states , the nonlinear eqs.1 should be solved . in the presence of impurities",
    "there is no distinct gap , in the sense that the minimal excitation energy does not coincide with the maximum in the density of states .",
    "the latter is defined in terms of @xmath183 namely , the superconducting density of states @xmath184 in units of the normal density of states at the fermi level @xmath185 is @xmath186 where @xmath187 is the analytical continuation of @xmath188 an analytical solution for @xmath189 is not straightforward to obtain ; however , some properties of the numerically obtained solutions for @xmath189 are already illustrated above in fig.[inducedgaps ] .",
    "moreover , there are some rigorous statements that can be made about @xmath189 .",
    "let us consider again the limit of the superstrong isotropic non - magnetic scattering .",
    "we have shown above that @xmath0 in this case is reduced to @xmath0 of the equivalent bcs system with the isotropic coupling constant .",
    "the same statement appears to be true for the gap in the excitation spectrum .",
    "indeed , following ag , we can define @xmath190 and , after the usual transformation @xmath191",
    "@xmath192 @xmath193 we can write down the multiband analog of the eq.42@xmath194 of ag : @xmath195 in the absence of magnetic impurities we let @xmath196 and tend @xmath197 evidently , a solution of eq .",
    "[ ag45 ] in this limit exists only if @xmath198 and correspondingly @xmath199 do not depend on @xmath14 we conclude that in this limit the reduced density of states is the same in all bands , and in fact coincides with that of the isotropic bcs model with the gap determined from the nonlinear analog of eq.[lam - strong ] : @xmath200 with@xmath201    the evolution of the densities of states in a multiband non - magnetic scattering case is shown on fig.[dos ] . here",
    ", we show the results of numerical solution of eqs . 1 in the weak coupling regime with @xmath202 , @xmath203 and @xmath204 .",
    "only nonmagnetic interband scattering @xmath205 is included . in the clean limit ,",
    "the two bands show two different excitation gaps . in accordance with earlier calculations@xcite ,",
    "any weak , but finite impurity scattering mixes the pairs in the two bands , so that the first band ( with the larger gap , _ i.e. _ more superconducting ) develops a tail in the density of states which extends all the way down to the second - band gap . except for this tail , which consists of the normal excitations of the second band , scattered into the first band by impurities , the density of states still looks similar to the clean - limit one . upon the increase of the scattering rate , the low - energy tail in the first band density of states grows , and the minimal gap , the gap in the second band grows as well .",
    "this reflects the fact that larger number of pairs is scattered into the second band and induced the interband - proximity - effect superconductivity there .",
    "thus the _ decrease _ in the critical temperature of the system is accompanied by the _ increase _ of the minimal gap in the excitation spectrum .    next , let us include interband magnetic scattering into eq.[ag45 ] .",
    "then in the considered regime @xmath206 we have @xmath207 and @xmath208 ( we assumed @xmath209 ) . as a result ,",
    "the densities of states in each band are given by @xmath210 , where @xmath211 is a solution of the equation @xmath212 an energy gap corresponds to maximum real solution for @xmath211 in the interval @xmath213 and the pair - breaking rate is given by @xmath214 .",
    "thus , with increase of non - magnetic scattering we have a crossover from the state with different signs of order parameters in different bands ( for zero @xmath64 ) to the isotropic state ( for @xmath206 ) .",
    "this isotropic state may be normal , gapless or gapped , depending on the value of @xmath215 .",
    "following the ag analysis , we obtain that an energy gap at @xmath163 will exist if @xmath216 , where @xmath217 is the bcs gap at @xmath218 .",
    "this case is particularly interesting : since in the isotropic ( @xmath206 ) limit there is a finite gap and a finite positive order parameter in both bands , and in the opposite limit of small @xmath64 the order parameter in one band is negative , it is clear that at intermediate values of interband scattering @xmath64 a gapless state should be crossed over .",
    "the last statement is in agreement with the result of ref .",
    "that for an order parameter with a sign change and a nonzero fermi - surface average , a gapless state develops with an increase of impurity concentration , but the gap is restored at large concentration of impurities . to illustrate such crossover , induced by magnetic scattering , we show in fig.[dos - magn ] the results of our numerical calculations for a weak coupling 2-band model ( @xmath219 and @xmath220 .",
    "the total density of states is shown at different values of interband nonmagnetic scattering rate @xmath64 . according to the discussion in section [ isr ] , for small @xmath221",
    "both order parameters have different signs . in this case",
    "@xmath222 has no pair - breaking effect , and small gap ( negative order parameter ) is induced in the second band by the magnetic scattering . on the contrary ,",
    "the interband @xmath221 is in this situation pair - breaking .",
    "the shape of the density of states shows two characteristic peaks , one , at about 0.1@xmath223 due to this induced energy gap in the second band , and another just below @xmath217 from the gap in the first band .    with the increase of the nonmagnetic scattering rate the order parameter in the second band becomes smaller in the absolute value , still remaining negative .",
    "the lower peak in the density of states gets washed out and the minimal energy gap becomes smaller .",
    "when @xmath64 approaches @xmath224 this small gap vanishes , although there is still a distinguishable peak in the density of states coming from the gap in the first band .",
    "at larger @xmath225 both gaps have again the same sign and now it is @xmath222 , which is pair - breaking . as one",
    "again can see from fig.[dos - magn ] , a small gap is restored for the last two curves , corresponding to @xmath226 and @xmath227 .",
    "note that at @xmath228 the gap can not any more be ascribable to any of the two bands , but corresponds to a fully isotropic superconductivity , as described by eqs.[tc1]-[lam - strong ] .",
    "in conclusion , we generalize the abrikosov - gorkov solution on the case of arbitrary interband anisotropy of the pairing interaction , and arbitrary strength and anisotropy of magnetic and/or nonmagnetic impurity scattering .",
    "the results are illustrated on model two - band systems with interband anisotropy and various kinds of impurity scattering . in case of weak scattering",
    ", we found an analytic solution , analogous to the isotropic solution of abrikosov - gorkov .",
    "for weak anisotropy , this solution yields the critical temperature suppression proportional to the mean square variation of the order parameter , the fact earlier pointed out by several authors in various special cases .",
