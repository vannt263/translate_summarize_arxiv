    "surveys of young pre - main - sequence ( pms ) stars based on iras colors detect mainly the classical ttauri stars ( ctt ) , with ages less than 10myr , due to their important dusty accretion disks . among them , one of the most comprehensive was the `` pico dos dias survey '' ( pds ) @xcite . the weak ttauri stars ( wtt ) are mainly detected by the x - rays produced in their active coronae , since their disks in general contain no more sufficient dust .",
    "finally , there should exist even more evolved young stars , with masses smaller or comparable to the sun and ages between about 10 to 70myr - the so - called post - ttauri stars ( ptt ) .",
    "if star formation were constant during the last 100myr , a large number of uniformly distributed ptt should exist in the solar neighborhood .",
    "nevertheless , the first searches for ptt resulted in very few objects @xcite .",
    "this lack of discoveries may indicate that star formation was not constant in time .",
    "however , as the disks around ptt are even more evolved than those around wtt , they should have been dissipated or agglutinated into planetesimals and they hardly would be detected in surveys based on the far infrared or even on h@xmath1 emission , as it can be very weak in ptt .",
    "the detection of x - ray sources by the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ) @xcite outside important star formation regions gave some hope that these are the expected population of ptt .",
    "nevertheless , several considerations cast doubts about the ptt nature of those dispersed objects @xcite , indicating that most of them could be active main sequence ( ms ) stars .",
    "@xcite suggests that most of them are connected with the local association . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite found that some of those objects could be pms stars ejected from forming clouds .",
    "she also notes that the wtt around the chamaleon region appear to be formed in small short - lived cloudlets @xcite . in any case , this large population of x - ray sources around star forming clouds seems to be represented by a mixture of pms and young ms objects .",
    "do genuine ptt exist and where are they ?",
    "the main point of this work is that ptt can be found in physically characterized dispersed groups , with ages larger than the mean lifetime of the original clouds . in such case",
    "they may be located far from any cloud .",
    "in fact , we discovered the first of this kind of association when we were searching for new ttauri stars among iras point sources in a five degree radius around , an already known isolated ctt at high galactic latitude @xcite .",
    "hipparcos parallaxes show that this is a nearby association , the distance of being @xcite .",
    "several research groups became interested in this association and other members were found [ see .",
    "e.g. , @xcite ] .",
    "today nearly 13 young systems totalling 21 stars and a brown dwarf are known to belong to the association ( twa ) @xcite and this constitutes a sufficiently large density of pms stars in a localized region of the sky to consider it as a real cluster .",
    "futhermore , the stars appear to have a common origin @xcite and the best age estimated for the association is @xmath010myr @xcite .",
    "other groups of wtt , apparently isolated from clouds , have been detected at larger distances , as the cluster at 100pc @xcite or the one in front of the translucent clouds mbm7 and mbm55 @xcite .",
    "the former appears to be more clearly defined , beeing nearly 40 times more compact than the twa and seems to be related to the sco - cenob association .",
    "studies of this kind of clusters are important to understand the beginning of dispersion of regions containing also massive stars .",
    "we propose in this paper the existence of a new nearby association around ( = ) , older and more isolated from clouds than the twa .",
    "the high galactic latitude active star , despite not being an iras source , was observed during the pds and classified as a wtt @xcite . distinctly from our earlier search for the twa region , where candidates were selected by their infrared emission , around we used rass sources .",
    "we began with an area of centered on :    and later we enlarged it to about :    in order to find the limits of the possible association .",
    "we also chose three control areas , two of them of where no isolated pms star was known to exist @xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "the first control area was chosen in the southern galactic hemisphere :    the second area was in the northern galactic hemisphere :    and the third one was in the direction of the known twa , measuring :    as possible optical counterparts , we selected stars brighter than @xmath013mag within the error boxes of the rass , using the gsc and tycho catalogues .",
    "we found 19 , 46 , 23 , 33 and 23 x - ray sources with observable counterparts , respectively in the inner and outer areas around , in the northern , in the southern and in the twa regions . in the outer area around we discarded , for observation , 10 bright stars , 9 being of the bright star catalogue .",
    "these stars are , in general , well known and , in fact , none is a good candidate for their spectral type and space velocities .",
    "the only dwarf later than f is @xmath4ret , that has been studied recently by @xcite .",
    "these ten stars are included at the end of table1 and we take them into account when doing the statistics in this paper .",
    "we observed then 36 x - ray sources in this outer region .",
    "figure3 summarizes graphically our strategy around ereri .    in september 1997 and january 1998",
    "we observed the candidates , taking low resolution spectra using the b&c spectrograph installed at the cassegrain focus of the 1.52 m eso telescope at la silla , chile . the configuration used ( grating of and the ccd#39 )",
    "gives a final dispersion of . in 1999 , using the same telescope , we obtained high resolution spectra for the selected candidates , with the feros echelle spectrograph @xcite , which gives a total coverage of 4000 and a resolving power of 50000 . to complete the extended area around we took also some spectra using the coud spectrograph ( grating of ; resolution of 9000 ; spectral coverage of 450 centered at 6500 , using the ccd#101 ) of the 1.60 m telescope of the observatrio do pico dos dias ( opd ) , brazil .",
    "photometry for most of the selected stars ( except in the southern control region ) was obtained using fotrap @xcite at the 0.60 m telescope of the opd .",
    "the main results of these surveys are given in tables 1 to 4 .",
    "in these tables we present the possible optical counterparts , the photometric data , our spectral types and the equivalent widths of the li line @xmath56707.8 ( w@xmath6 ) .",
    "the lii line , when present in late type stars , can provide a first estimate for the age @xcite , selecting possible ptt , moreover if the h@xmath1 line is in emission or filled - in . in such way we consider young stars those with spectral types between g0 and k2 with , but for later types just the presence of the li line will be a sufficient condition . for hotter stars",
    "the li line is not a good discriminator for age ( see section8 ) and , in general , we will limit our discussion to stars later than f in this paper .    in tables 5 and 6",
    "we present the kinematical and physical data of the possible young stars of the ereri and of the control regions , respectively . the data in italic mean deduced values , taking into account duplicity or estimated ones , for parallaxes and radial velocities , as we will see later . to obtain the li abundances presented in column13",
    ", we used our modified version of a lte code kindly made available to us by monique spite , of paris - meudon observatory .",
    "these li abundances ( and the , column14 ) were determined by fitting synthetic spectra to the observed ones . in the computation of the synthetic spectra , all the known atomic lines in the range @xmath7@xmath8 were taken into account . as the molecular bands are not taken into account , the uncertainties are higher for m type stars .",
    "the used stellar atmospheric models are from gustafsson and collaborators @xcite .",
    "for all stars we used , microturbulence velocity of and solar abundances .",
    "the li abundance is not very sensitive to gravity and the main source of errors is the inaccuracy of the used effective temperatures ( column11 ) .    in the area around",
    "there are 19 x - ray sources having possible young stars as counterparts ( 8 in the inner area ) .",
    "the 4 visual binaries ( erx22 , erx33 , erx37 and erx47 ) were counted as one entry each and we excluded in this count ereri = erx24 for reasons we will see below .",
    "we included in table5 three f stars kinematically similar to the later stars , presenting weak li line ( erx19 , erx35 and erx38 ) .",
    "nevertheless , they will be excluded in any statistical consideration .",
    "there is an indication that a young stellar association may exist in the direction of the inner area , as the number of x - ray sources associated with ptt candidates relative to all selected sources with optical counterparts , as explained in section2 , is greater than in all other regions .",
    "actually , it is @xmath040% in the inner area , decreasing to @xmath025% in the additional region .",
    "this latter frequency is similar to the one of the southern control region , decreasing even more in the northern region ( @xmath010% ) , as can be seen in table8 .",
    "the known twa region may furnish another useful comparison when searching for ptt associations far from clouds .",
    "the limits in right ascension and declination for this region were established somewhat larger than the other control regions to include the five known members of the association at the moment of the survey .",
    "we observed this region in the same way as the others and detected 9 possible young stars among 23 x - ray selected optical counterparts .",
    "five of them ( trx9 , trx11 , trx12 , trx18 and trx20 ) are the already known members @xcite , two ( trx16 and trx21 ) were independently discovered by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the frequency of possible young stars in the known twa is very similar to the one we found in the inner region .",
    "is there a new young association in that part of the sky ? to answer this question we used several criteria in order to characterize the young stars of this possible association and to define its true members .",
    "these involve their kinematical properties , relative proximity in the sky , ages , x - ray emission , the intensity of li lines , the behavior of the h@xmath1 line and stellar rotation . in the following",
    "we will discuss these different criteria .",
    "in tables 5 and 6 we present in columns 2 to 5 the proper motions , radial velocities and parallaxes of the young stars . proper motions and parallaxes measured by the hipparcos satellite are available for 11 of the 23 candidate members of the association around and for 6 stars of the control areas . for the other stars the proper motions are from the catalogue @xcite ( exceptions : for trx12 , we used @xcite ; for erx16 and srx11 , we calculated the proper motions using ac2000 and gsc ) .",
    "both catalogues are equally accurate @xcite and the errors are usually less than 4 .",
    "these translate to tangential velocity errors of @xmath0 if the stars are at 50pc . as proper motions of stars erx32 and erx53",
    "are not available , they will not be taken into account in kinematical considerations .",
    "we obtained the radial velocities using feros or opd coud spectra and their errors are similar to those in tangential velocities .",
    "we obtained more than one radial velocity for some stars : erx4 ( 3 measurements ) , erx16 ( 2 ) , erx21 ( 6 ) , erx22n ( 3 ) , erx26 ( 2 ) , erx32 ( 2 ) , erx33n ( 2 ) , erx33s ( 2 ) and erx45 ( 2 ) .",
    "none of these stars presents noticeable variations and we assume also that the others are not spectroscopic binaries ( sb ) .",
    "but we found that ( erx24 ) is a double line sb with an orbital period of 5.9255days and the radial velocity used in table5 is the @xmath9 velocity ( ) . the analysis of this system showed that is a rscvn type binary at @xmath0330pc @xcite and , although being the bulls - eye for our search , it has nothing to do with the proposed association .",
    "this indicates that some of the other objects classified as `` young stars '' in this work may be found to be other kinds of active stars when examined in more detail . for erx35 , a known sb",
    ", we used the @xmath9 velocity from @xcite .",
    "the radial velocities in table6 for srx8s , a faint optical companion of srx8n , and for srx28 , not measured by us , have been assumed to be 30 , about the mean value for the region .",
    "idem for srx18 , a double line sb , for which we have only one spectrum . for trx10n we used the value of its brighter companion .",
    "to estimate the distances for the stars in the region not measured by hipparcos , we began supposing that they all are in the zero - age ms ( zams ) . with the distances",
    "thus obtained we computed the space velocity components relative to the sun , u , v ( in the direction of galactic rotation ) and w. these initial results are plotted , in the u - v plane , in figure1a . as can be visualized in the figure",
    "there is a systematic difference between the stars with the reliable parallaxes from hipparcos ( full circles ) and the others .",
    "the latter are shifted in the direction towards .",
    "this distribution is highly improbable and it can be explained only if the distances are underestimated .",
    "there are two ways to produce this underestimation :    _ a ) _ almost all stars not measured by hipparcos are binaries with similar components .",
    "this will increase the luminosities and decrease the derived distances . even though possible",
    ", this is very unlikely as the only difference between the group with higher velocities and that with lower ones lies in the fact that the stars of the former are brighter and , therefore , measured by hipparcos .",
    "this is an obvious contradiction with the hypothesis .    _",
    "b ) _ the stars not measured by hipparcos are more luminous than predicted by zams and , of course , younger .    if we assume this much more probable hypothesis ( but keeping in mind that for some stars hypothesis ( a ) may be true ) we can obtain kinematical parallaxes by adjusting them so as to minimize the moduli of the velocity vectors centered on the mean vector of the hipparcos member stars .",
    "the space velocity components of the 6 stars with measured parallaxes ( and in this particular context we included the f stars to increase the statistical significance ) are :    ( u , v , w)=(@xmath10 )    these errors are compatible with the very low observational errors for these stars ( @xmath0 ) , plus an additional scattering of @xmath0 , expected for the original velocity dispersion during star formation . after obtaining a first set of kinematical parallaxes",
    ", we redefined the central vector including the stars within 2@xmath11 of the distribution , but excluding now the f stars .",
    "we minimized again the moduli , but the changes were small and we stopped the process at this point .",
    "the distances and space velocity components obtained in this way are presented in columns5 to 8 of table5 and the new u - v diagram is shown in figure1b .",
    "there is now a compact core formed by 12 stars , two of them being f stars , erx22n and erx19 .",
    "one is a binary , erx37 , and for it we will take the mean values .",
    "the remaining 10 stars have the following mean space velocity components :    ( u , v , w)=(@xmath12 ) +    the rather large @xmath11 in the w velocity is mainly due to the radial velocity of erx14 . to reduce it to the mean w velocity we would need to reduce the radial velocity by @xmath0 .",
    "this could be achieved by a large , but not impossible , measurement error or erx14 may be a single line sb . without it",
    "we would have .",
    "these ten stars form the `` probable members '' of an association which henceforth we will call the `` _ horologium association _ '' ( hora ) , since the majority of the members are in the constellation of the horologium and we will try to prove that this is a real association .    the next star that might be included in the hora is erx4 , at 3.8@xmath11 of the vector defined by the 10 stars ( or 5.9@xmath11 excluding erx14 ) and we can consider this star , that lies in a corner of the surveyed area , a limit case of possible member .",
    "only a very improbable conjugation of errors could bring its velocity near the mean of the 10 stars .",
    "the next one , the f star erx35 , will be at 10.6@xmath11 ( or 15.5@xmath11 excluding erx14 ) .",
    "even if we include erx4 , this star will be at 6.8@xmath11 .",
    "it is almost impossible that observational errors could bring this or any other selected star to the core of figure1b .",
    "we `` rejected '' these stars as members of the association and deduced their parallaxes as if they were on the zams ( table5 ) .",
    "we call `` possible members '' , in addition to erx4 , the f stars in the core and the stars erx32 and erx53 , with unknown proper motions but physically not rejectable . for reasons presented in section6 , we classified the star erx37n as possible member .",
    "( the star erx24 , or ereri , is retained in this table as a `` rejected young star '' , in spite of being older , for comparison to other possible mismatched cases ) .",
    "the space velocity components obtained for the hora are similar to those of the complex for the local association    ( u , v , w)=(@xmath13 )    represented by the pleiades and the @xmath14per groups , with ages between 20 and 150myr @xcite .",
    "@xcite has previously noted such similarity between the kinematics of li rich active late type stars and the local association .",
    "but for the hora the scattering of space velocities and the modulus of w are lower than the values of the local association . in this sense , these values are distinct from any of the young pleiades subgroups found by @xcite .    in columns6 to 8 of table6",
    "we give the space velocity components relative to the sun for the control regions . to estimate parallaxes of the stars not in the hipparcos catalogue of the northern and southern control areas and of the non - members of the twa ,",
    "we suppose they are on the zams . for the twa",
    ", we obtain kinematical parallaxes for the three stars with known proper motions in the same way as for the hora , using as a mean vector the velocities of trx9 and trx18 . with these five members",
    "the distance of the twa is 45pc .",
    "of course , a better estimation would be obtained using also the proposed members outside our surveyed area , but there is no published complete set of data for none of them .",
    "anyway , the distances obtained here are in agreement with @xcite .",
    "( twa9 has a hipparcos parallax of 19.9mas , near our mean distance for the twa . )",
    "the space velocity components obtained from these five stars are :    ( u , v , w)=(@xmath15 )    they are close to those of the hora .    for the control regions ( table6 ) ,",
    "there is a concentration in the u - v plane at about ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) for five stars in the southern region . do these young stars form another distinct physical association ? only srx1 and srx6 have trigonometric parallaxes - they seem mutually related - and we can use as a mean vector their velocities .",
    "but the obtained kinematical parallaxes for the stars srx22 , srx18 and srx28 would place them _ below _ the ms . actually , the last two stars would fall far below the ms .",
    "put in another way , their distances and the scattering in space velocities would increase if they were younger . the result for srx11 is almost the same as if it were on the ms .",
    "thus , the entries in table6 represent the best we can do for this region . therefore , this concentration has discrepant parallaxes , a scattering in w velocities of and an age near the zams , rejecting it as a possible association .",
    "two possibilities arise : either the concentration in the u - v plane is produced by a statistical fluctuation , as it seems the case for the southern control region , or it is the result of a real association , as for the twa region .",
    "a fluctuation is not as improbable as it might appear at first glance since , all stars being young , they have space velocity components resembling those of the local association .",
    "nevertheless , a real association must have a set of other characteristics alike and that is the case for the hora , as we will show below .    another way to test",
    "if the found concentration is a distinct one is to confront it with the more homogeneous sample formed by the hipparcos catalogue . in figure2",
    "we have plotted all stars measured by hipparcos ( excluding those that are probable or possible members of table5 ) , with distances smaller than 90pc in the same area of the sky of the hora .",
    "to compute space velocity components , we adopted for all stars an artificial radial velocity of ( close to the mean of the proposed association ) . in this way",
    ", the dispersion of space velocities is somewhat reduced .",
    "there is no concentration anywhere in figure2 , even at the position of hora velocity components .",
    "this is what may be expected if the hora is real , formed by young active objects with constrained kinematics , and not a general behavior of the stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "there are six other stars near the core of the hora velocity distribution and , as they could be its non - active members , we got them together in table7 .",
    "all have spectral types earlier than f6 , as expected if they were the more massive and non x - ray emitting stars of the hora .",
    "the hotter one is ( ) , a well known be star , already leaving the ms , whose evolutive age is similar to that of the proposed association .",
    "if we use the radial velocity given in simbad , its space velocity components are near those of the proposed association ( @xmath186.1 , @xmath1824.2 , @xmath186.3 ) ( a in fig.1 ) .",
    "in figure3 we show a map of the selected x - ray sources in the region .",
    "the sources not associated with young objects are evenly distributed .",
    "the young stars not belonging to the hora are also almost evenly distributed ( we attributed the lack of stars at lower right ascensions to their small number ) .",
    "the probable and possible members of the hora seem more assembled to the center .",
    "it is yet difficult to be sure about the boundaries of the hora , but towards the north there is a lack of members for at least @xmath19 .",
    "this northern strip may be converted into one more control region . in this region , of the 20 observed plus 4 bright stars , less than 10% may be young .",
    "( now and hereafter in this section , we will consider only stars later than f , binaries taken as one star . ) the stars in this northern strip in table5 are marked with asterisks .",
    "defining _ a posteriori _ the declination limits of the hora region in the same way as we did for the twa region ( that is , ) , it contains 33 selected x - ray sources and 5 bright stars not observed , 16 being young stars ( 42% ) , 13 of them probable or possible members of the hora .",
    "this is a 270 square degrees area and the density of selected x - ray sources is 0.14 stars per square degree , being 0.06 for all young stars and 0.05 for the proposed members of the hora ( that is , possible and probable non - f stars ) .",
    "similarly , in the selected 182 square degrees twa region , the densities of selected x - ray sources , young stars and members of the association are , respectively , 0.13 , 0.05 and 0.04 . in the northern strip ( 174 square degrees ) and in the northern and southern control regions",
    "the densities of x - ray selected sources and young stars are , respectively , 0.14 and 0.01 ; 0.23 and 0.02 ; 0.33 and 0.08 .",
    "the density of x - ray sources in the southern region is much higher than in all other regions and this explains its higher density of young stars .",
    "there is no obvious explanation for such excess as the young stars of this region seems not to be physically related .",
    "it is possible that this larger density in the southern region reflects only a preferential exploration of the ecliptic poles by the rosat satellite .",
    "taking this higher x - ray density into account , the hora is the densest region , slightly denser than the inner twa .",
    "( the statistics of the several classes of selected x - ray sources of the observed regions - or sub - regions - are summarized in table8 . )    considering only the members of both associations , the density of the hora is higher than that of the twa ( 0.05 to 0.038 ) .",
    "it should be noted that two of the stars found by @xcite in the twa , that are not in our surveyed region , are very near our boundaries . but",
    "three others are far from the center of the twa , two of them being @xmath0@xmath20 from its apparent border .",
    "this shows how difficult it is to be sure about the limits of the hora .",
    "the list of the proposed candidates of the twa outside our surveyed area @xcite is presented in table9 with our measured photometric data ( except for the bright star ) .",
    "the membership in the twa is easier to establish due to its younger age .",
    "even if its boundaries are not yet known , it is very improbable that it extends all over the sky as there is no star so young in any other of our surveyed areas . for the hora",
    "this is more difficult to settle on as the stars may be rather similar to local association stars .",
    "nevertheless , looking at the space motions in the control regions , only nrx1 could be considered as a possible , but not probable , member of the hora .",
    "( the members of the twa , as noted before , have space motions not far from those of the hora ) .    using only the stars with known trigonometric parallaxes ,",
    "the distance of the hora would be .",
    "the mean distance , using also the kinematical parallaxes , is @xmath060pc .",
    "the distance , based on hipparcos , is an underestimation , as it measures only the brighter , that means nearer , members .",
    "erx8 , the faintest member directly measured by hipparcos , and also the reddest one , is of visual magnitude 9 .",
    "the kinematical parallaxes give a dispersed association , @xmath050pc in diameter .",
    "if we suppose that the original velocity dispersion during star formation is equal to the average modulus of the velocity vectors ( ) , obtained as explained in section4 , the size of the hora would be , again , @xmath050pc after 30myr .",
    "this size , at @xmath060pc , implies that the true angular extent of the hora could be @xmath21 , much larger than our observed region .",
    "in this case , many other young objects may be missing in our survey . a possible one is , whose space velocity components ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) are not far from those of the hora .",
    "even though the w velocity is nearer to that of the local association , the ratio and the age of 30myr @xcite are similar to those of the hora . a more extended survey is necessary to decide about such kind of possibility .",
    "the parallaxes for the stars of the twa give a diameter of @xmath020pc .",
    "taking into account an age of @xmath010myr @xcite , this would imply an original velocity dispersion similar to the one we found for the hora .",
    "if spherical , this diameter results in an angular extent of @xmath25 , which is the size needed to embrace all the members found by @xcite .",
    "an approach to the evolutionary state of the hora can be made using a diagram of absolute magnitude m@xmath26 versus ( ) . when calculating absolute magnitudes , no correction for interstellar extinction was applied as these stars are nearby and are not iras sources .",
    "actually , the possible member erx19 , a f type star , is a very weak iras source , detected only in 12@xmath27 , 0.24j , near the detection limit .",
    "two other stars in table5 are associated with weak iras sources , erx35 and erx38 , but they do not belong to the hora . in all these cases",
    "the iras fluxes come from the stellar photospheres and from here on we will consider that there are no iras sources in the association .",
    "in figure4 we present the m@xmath26 versus ( ) diagram , its respective isochrones and evolutionary paths for some stellar masses calculated by @xcite .",
    "the proposed members not measured by hipparcos had their parallaxes estimated kinematically as explained in section4 .",
    "as almost all probable members are near the isochrone of 30myr , the two stars without proper motions , erx32 and erx53 , had their distances estimated supposing they are on this isochrone .",
    "although the distances of the majority of the stars of the hora were obtained only from kinematical considerations , they have a small scattering in the evolutive diagram as almost all are on the isochrone of 30myr , as expected for a young association .",
    "this is very unlikely to result by chance alone and we propose this as a first approximation for the age of the hora .",
    "approximate stellar masses can be obtained by direct comparison with the positions of the stars in figure4 with respect to the stellar evolution paths .",
    "the mass distribution function has a maximum around .",
    "there are some differences between this mass distribution and that of the other young stars in the control regions .",
    "the hora stars are nearer and less massive objects than the other young field stars and more massive than those of the twa .",
    "that is , most of the hora members are k type stars at distances from 40 to 80pc whereas most of the young field stars are g type stars at 50 to 100pc and the twa members are late k or m type stars . where are the m stars of the hora and the young k - m stars of the control regions ?",
    "probably beyond our observational limit of 13 mag .",
    "as we established this limit using gsc ( that is , b magnitude @xmath013 ) , our limit for redder stars is . for on the zams",
    ", this will represent stars beyond 100pc and for , with an age of 30myr , stars beyond 30pc .",
    "the few young k type field stars detected indicate that they are more li depleted than those of the hora .",
    "depletion makes the li line more difficult to be detected and , in fact , some stars with a dubious li line in the b&c spectra present w@xmath6 values between 0.05 and when observed with feros . as the stars of the twa are younger , the m stars are intrinsically brighter and less li depleted , being then easier to detect .",
    "we interpret these mass distributions as another indication that the age of the hora is between that of the twa and the young field stars . in any way",
    ", there seems to be a lack of g and early k type stars in the twa .",
    "this may be not the only difference between the twa and the hora . in the twa most of the stars are binaries @xcite and they are very few in the hora .",
    "in fact , with the instruments used , we are unable to detect close visual binaries in the hora - erx22 and erx37 being very wide .",
    "the primary of erx37 , lying above the 30myr isochrone , is a candidate to be investigated for duplicity . as the other stars are on the isochrone ( except for erx16 , see below ) , any eventual secondary must have a very large luminosity difference .",
    "we have very few radial velocity measurements to detect single line sb .",
    "nevertheless , at the sky position of the hora , the radial velocity is mainly in the w direction .",
    "even if , in general , we have not measured the stars more than once , the slightly larger scattering in the w velocity , obtained in section 4 , shows there is only a small possibility that some of these stars are sb .",
    "the best candidate is erx14 . for the twa we can compare the observations of this survey to those of the pds and ,",
    "at least , there is one sb - trx20 ( ) .",
    "double line sb might be detected in only one exposure and we found five previously unknown sb ( see tables1 , 2 and 3 ) , but none is a proposed member of the hora",
    ".    even considering this limited information we have an indication that the frequency of binaries in the hora is less than in the twa .",
    "the existence of some yet undetected binaries may decrease the scattering in the evolutive diagram even more .",
    "some of the objects in figure4 deserve detailed comments :    [ [ erx4 ] ] erx4 + + + +    ( ): this star is in the lower right corner of figure3 and has discordant space motions .",
    "it lies on the zams and this may be another reason to exclude it as proposed member of the hora .",
    "but , as its parallax was determined kinematically , the accidental errors that would conspire against suitable space velocity components could also underestimate the distance .",
    "we have observed thrice for radial velocity with similar values .",
    "it presents large variations in h@xmath1 - from absorption to a small emission .",
    "thus , we keep erx4 as a limit case of membership .",
    "[ [ erx14 ] ] erx14 + + + + +    ( ): the probable member with the large discordant w. its position in the evolutive diagram is compatible with the supposition that it may be a single line sb .",
    "we have only one radial velocity observation of this star .",
    "[ [ erx16 ] ] erx16 + + + + +    ( ): it is the only probable member having a discrepant position in the evolutive diagram , and , besides , this is the only star in table5 without proper motions .",
    "nevertheless , to check our proper motions , we used also the ppm and the usno - a2 , without any appreciable difference .",
    "for its absolute magnitude to be compatible with the age of 30myr , the distance should be @xmath080pc .",
    "this would result in . even not giving a perfect fit to the kinematics or age test to belong to the hora , it is still close enough to keep it as probable member .",
    "[ [ erx22 ] ] erx22 + + + + +    ( ): the stars of this system are separated by @xmath28 but whereas star erx22n was not directly measured by hipparcos , gives very similar proper motions and @xcite has not found changes in their relative position since 1919 , indicating that both stars constitute a physical pair separated by 2380au .",
    "therefore , the parallax of erx22n was taken as being equal to that of the primary .",
    "[ [ erx33 ] ] erx33 + + + + +    ( ): this visual binary has been detected as such by hipparcos , with a separation of @xmath29 , and our identical measured values of the radial velocities confirm it as a physical system .",
    "erx33s seems younger than the hora by its position in the evolutive diagram .",
    "the spectrum of the primary ( erx33n ) has a cooler system of lines superimposed ( like a late g or early k star ) and @xcite explain it by a close visual binary .",
    "( actually , the usno - a2 has two stars - the same ? - in the field , of 11.5 mag . , but they hardly could be the faint component . )",
    "@xcite measured also the of this system and found almost the reverse of our values .",
    "one possibility is that erx33s is a double line sb too , not resolved in both works .",
    "this could explain the positions in the evolutive diagram not in good agreement for coeval stars and , in this case , more compatible with an age similar to that of the hora .",
    "anyway , these stars should not be considered members of the hora due to their space velocities .",
    "[ [ erx37 ] ] erx37 + + + + +    ( ): this system had already been proposed by @xcite as an isolated pair of ptt .",
    "the separation is about @xmath30 and both stars are x - ray sources , the hotter one ( erx37s ) having a stronger flux , compatible with its larger ( ) - one of the highest for this association .",
    "our radial velocities are similar for both stars , as also found by @xcite , indicating that they could form a physical pair .",
    "the main problem is the large difference in li abundance between the components .",
    "one possible explanation is that erx37n may be a field dme star and the stars would not form a physical pair , only erx37s being member of the hora .",
    "nevertheless , if erx37n has an age of 30myrs , it would be at the same distance as the kinematical one obtained for erx37s , and this can hardly be accepted as being due to chance .",
    "another possibility , adopted by @xcite , takes into account a proposed dependence of li depletion with rotation . our measured low li abundance ( @xmath181.2 ) for the slow rotator",
    "erx37n is in the direction of such proposal .",
    "cautiously , we will consider erx37n as only a possible member of this association .",
    "erx37s is above the 30myr isochrone and this discrepant position could be an indication for duplicity .",
    "[ [ erx32-and - erx53 ] ] erx32 and erx53 + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    ( and ): the distances for these stars are estimated supposing they are on the isochrone of 30myr , as they have no measured proper motions .",
    "but they appear to be members of the hora for their large x - ray fluxes and large w@xmath6 , as we will see in the following sections .",
    "actually , the w@xmath6 for erx32 seems very high compared to the depletion expected for a m3 star , but its is also high for this spectral type .",
    "in column10 of tables5 and 6 we present the ratios of x - ray fluxes to total luminosities , following the procedure of @xcite to obtain the actual x - ray fluxes . in double systems",
    "we suppose that the x - ray fluxes are equally contributed by both components ( except for erx37 , for which we used the individual x - ray fluxes from @xcite ) .",
    "the values for the probable and possible members are high and compatible with those expected for pms stars @xcite - except for the f stars erx19 and erx22s - and they are near the empirical saturation level for the pleiades age @xcite .",
    "in fact , the mean ratio @xmath31 for the probable members is compatible with the evolutionary age @xcite and similar to that we obtained for the twa .",
    "only half of the young field stars have such high values .    among the probable or possible members of the hora , there are five stars with and four among young field stars : one in the northern strip , erx26 , two in the border of the hora region , erx50 and erx54 , and one sb , srx18 .",
    "there is also one star in the twa , a sb too , trx20 .",
    "the @xmath31 values for the probable and possible members of the hora , excluding f stars , are weakly correlated to .",
    "although this is expected if rotation is one of the main physical causes of the x - ray emission in late type stars , even this weak correlation is not easily obtained since differences in stellar inclinations and evolutionary stages smear out the correlations for non - coeval stars .",
    "in fact , there is nothing like that for the young field stars . as almost all measured stars of the twa present small it is impossible to draw any conclusion for this association .",
    "the rotation of shows that , if this star is synchronised , , which is incompatible with a wtt .",
    "actually we found that this star is a rscvn type system @xcite at 330pc and it was only by a very good luck that we found the hora taking it as the bull s eye of our search .",
    "because ptt are in an intermediate evolutionary stage between ctt or young wtt and active ms stars , genuine ptt are expected to have a peculiar h@xmath1 behavior @xcite .",
    "actually , the w@xmath32 of the members of the hora behave in a monotonic mode with respect to temperature , with fill - in at and in emission for later type stars . for the young field stars there is more scattering , but the different distributions of stellar temperatures between both samples",
    "makes a detailed comparison difficult .",
    "one of the best confirmations of the ptt nature of the stars , whose membership to the hora was established by their space motions , comes from the li lines .",
    "@xcite , comparing the behavior of the w@xmath6 with temperature for a sample of ctt and stars of some young clusters , including the pleiades , finds a gap ( the ptt - gap ) for stars cooler than 5250k , between the high w@xmath6 formed by ctt and the lower w@xmath6 formed by young ms stars belonging to the local association .",
    "a similar conclusion is obtained by @xcite .",
    "the li abundance is not a good criterium to discriminate ptt above the cutoff at , as there is almost no li depletion in hotter stars .",
    "the w@xmath6 of the stars of the hora are mainly in the lower edge of the ptt - gap ( fig.5 ) .",
    "the figure shows that the hora is younger than the youngest open clusters of the local association plotted by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the two stars of the hora with w@xmath6 similar to the ones of the young field stars have the smallest .",
    "ten young field stars are cooler than the cutoff in temperature , but only two of them may be younger than the local association : srx8s and trx10n .",
    "the latter seems a physical binary whose primary has a w@xmath6 normal for a young star of its temperature , whereas the weak value of the secondary was obtained from a low resolution spectrum and is of low quality , making it a poor candidate for ptt .",
    "srx8s , the optical companion of the brighter srx8n , had its w@xmath6 measured also on a low resolution spectrum .",
    "its w@xmath32 indicates some filling - in , but as it is very near the temperature cutoff , it is not a good ptt candidate too .",
    "the stars of the twa are on the upper edge of the ptt - gap , and some of its members are similar to ctt or wtt . the gap between the twa and the hora stars in figure5 indicates the amount of li depletion in @xmath020myr .",
    "in view of all the above arguments , we can conclude that there is , in the direction of the star , an association of very young stars , younger than the majority of the groups of the local association and older than the twa , characterized by the space motions and with properties that we have not found in other parts of the sky .",
    "we named it the `` horologium association '' .",
    "its isolation from clouds is quite remarkable .",
    "even if there are some dispersed infrared cirrus at a few degrees from its center @xcite , the nearest clouds are at @xmath33 from it",
    ". moreover , these are co translucent clouds , where there is no evidence for star formation @xcite . in any case , considering the proposed age for this association ( @xmath030myr ) , it is hopeless trying to find its birth place .",
    "it is also interesting to note that contrary to the twa , which is formed by a mixture of a few ctt as itself and a larger number of ptt , the hora is formed only by ptt where none of them is an iras source , indicating the absence of dusty accretion disks .",
    "this suggests that , at their advanced evolutionary stage , the circumstellar disks have been dissipated or agglomerated into planetesimals and , therefore , the hora can give an upper limit for the lifetime of the disks .",
    "@xcite discussed the problem raised by the existence of some isolated ctt having active disks in the twa , as itself .",
    "there is also the case of the visual binary in the same cluster , where the component b could be evolving from a ctt to wtt stage @xcite .",
    "we suppose that the twa will evolve into the hora stage and that the disks around their ctt will loose the iras properties in a time scale of less than 30myr .",
    "considering that the majority of objects in the twa are wtt , the few ctt would be in their last stages of activity .",
    "the transformation of the disks would consist in converting their dust into pre - planetary material .",
    "quite recently @xcite have detected a planet of 2.2jupiter masses in an earth - like orbit ( 320days ) around the star ( erx38 ) , one of the rejected members in table5 . as this star seems not to belong to the hora",
    ", we could not use the age of this association to get a better idea of the time scale of the formation of a planet around a young star . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite propose that the protoplanetary disk of has only 20myr , less than the age of the hora .",
    "probably there is no universal time scale for the apparition of planets , that should depend on the properties of the accreting disk .",
    "exploring a region of about around the high galactic latitude active star , previously classified as a wtt @xcite , we found evidences of a new association , the `` horologium association '' , formed mainly by bona fide low mass ptt .",
    "its probable and possible members are marked with asterisks in table1 and are discriminated in table5 .",
    "possible hot members are presented in table7 .",
    "itself was found to be a background rscvn - like system . since we found no low mass ptt in the two control areas , as can be seen in figure5",
    ", we believe that hora - like stellar groups are not numerous in the solar vicinity , indicating a non constant rate of star formation in the last 100myr .",
    "this new association is presently represented by at least 10 members ( table5 ) , having an age of @xmath030myr and is older than the isolated twa , with an age of approximately 10myr . until now there are no detected binaries in the hora ( stars erx22n and erx22s have a separation of 2380au and should be considered as common proper motion stars ) .",
    "if confirmed , this marked difference with the twa must be due to different intrinsic conditions of star formation of these two associations .",
    "the hora is even more isolated from clouds than the twa and , in any case , we can expect that its original cloud could have dissipated in less than 30myr .",
    "the distances of the stars in the hora cover an interval from nearly 40 to about 90pc ( at a mean distance of @xmath060pc ) giving a diameter of @xmath050pc , compatible with the size produced after 30myr by an initial velocity dispersion of . if this size is the same in angular extent , it surpasses the surveyed region and could contain many other members , such as the interesting young star . in the surveyed region",
    "there may be hotter members , that are not x - ray sources , ( for example , the nearby be star ) having similar ages , distances and space motions .",
    "if this is the case , the hora could be the remnant of an old ob association , but , due to the kinematical errors , there is little hope to localize its birth place .",
    "the space velocity components of the hora are near but distinct from those of the local association .",
    "in fact , in all surveyed regions we found young field stars , possible members of the local association , with a compatible li depletion .",
    "but , for its well defined kinematics , physical properties , li abundances and restricted location in the sky , the hora can be distinguished from these stars , resembling more the general behavior of the twa .",
    "considering the observational limitations , as that of the magnitude limit of the hipparcos measurements , we are aware of the challenge that represents the detection of a coeval moving group of stars with an age around 30myrs .",
    "to arrive at this , we examine several requirements that characterize a young stellar association .",
    "if no one of them , isolated , is completely sufficient , none of them are mutually contradictory and all together practically create the necessary condition for the establishment of the hora as a real nearby association .",
    "following @xcite and considering that large moving groups , more commonly known as eggen s superclusters , are not real clusters but are formed by a chance coincidence of smaller coeval streams , we can conceive the hora as one small , coeval structure in the pleiades supercluster . but its overall characteristics are distinct from those of the young pleiades subgroups found by @xcite . in any case , the hora may be one of the last episodes of star formation of the local association and could be useful to understand better its fine structure .    we thank l. siess for providing the theoretical evolutive diagram used in this work .",
