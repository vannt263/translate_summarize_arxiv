    "increasing experimental , theoretical and numerical evidences are showing that single - component systems can have more than the two commonly known fluid phases : gas and liquid .",
    "there is no thermodynamic inconsistency , indeed , in hypnotizing the possible existence of a phase transition between two ( or more ) liquids at different densities .",
    "direct experimental evidences of this phenomenon have been observed in liquid phosphorous @xcite and triphenyl phosphite @xcite , while consistent data exists for water @xcite , silica @xcite , aluminate liquids @xcite , selenium @xcite , and cobalt @xcite , among others @xcite .",
    "simulations predict a liquid - liquid critical point for supercooled water @xcite , phosphorous @xcite , supercooled silica @xcite , and hydrogen @xcite . for other substances , such as carbon ,",
    "literature is contradictory @xcite .    in the last years",
    ", several models have been proposed to understand the origin of the liquid - liquid phase transition . within this context",
    "a large interest has been focused on isotropic core - softened models @xcite .",
    "the reason is twofold . on the one hand , within acceptable limitations",
    ", they are models for a variety of systems including liquid metals , metallic mixtures , electrolytes , colloids and protein solution , as well as anomalous liquids , like water and silica @xcite . on the other hand , their simple definition encourages to investigate the possibility of an intriguing relation between the liquid - liquid phase transition and the anomalies in specific observables , such as the density or the diffusivity , in network - forming liquids , like water and silica .",
    "different kinds of isotropic potentials with soft - core have been proposed . in many of them , with the soft - core given by a gaussian core @xcite or a ramp , the presence of a liquid - liquid phase transition is observed together with anomalies in the density , in the diffusion and in the structure @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with what is proposed for water on the basis of simulations and theoretical calculations for specific models @xcite .    in other attractive isotropic potentials , with the soft - core given by a square shoulder , the liquid - liquid phase transition occurs in absence of density anomaly @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , an asymptotic tendency to the density anomaly is observed in three dimensions @xcite , and thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies has been found in related models in two dimensions on lattices @xcite or off - lattice @xcite .    here we focus on the study of a potential that is the smooth version of the one with square shoulder and attractive well which we studied in ref .",
    "we find that the new continuous potential has a liquid - liquid phase transition , as well as the previous squared potential , consistent with the minimal difference between the two models .",
    "nevertheless , the difference is enough to cause the appearance of the density anomaly .",
    "hence , the anomalous behavior is strongly dependent on the fine details of the potential , including its derivative .",
    "we consider the following isotropic pairwise potential    @xmath0 } - u_a \\exp\\left [ -\\frac{(r - r_a)^2 } { 2\\delta_a^2}\\right ]   + \\left ( \\frac{a}{r}\\right)^{24 } ~ , \\label{pot}\\ ] ]    where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the energy of the repulsive shoulder and of the attractive well , respectively ; @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the hard - core distance , the repulsive average radius and the distance of the attractive minimum , respectively ; @xmath6 is a parameter related to the slope of the potential at @xmath4 ; @xmath7 is the variance of the gaussian centered at @xmath5 .    ) , for the parameters in the text ( continuous line ) , compared with the squared potential ( dashed line ) of refs .",
    "@xcite for @xmath8 , repulsive width @xmath9 and attractive width @xmath10 .",
    "the two potentials have the same @xmath11 , the same repulsive range @xmath12 and the same attractive width @xmath13 .",
    "the continuous potential crosses the lines of the shoulder and well of the squared potential approximately in the middle . ]    for the set of parameters @xmath8 , @xmath14 @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , at distance @xmath18 the value of the potential is @xmath19 , with @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "hence , to reduce the computational effort , we set a potential cutoff at @xmath18 and add a constant and a linear term to the potential in order to have both the potential and its @xmath22-derivative equal to zero at the cutoff .",
    "the resulting potential is @xmath23 where , for our choice of parameters and cutoff distance @xmath24 , the dimensionless constants are set to @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the approximate attractive width , calculated as the width at half height of the gaussian function defining the attractive well , is @xmath27 .",
    "the continuous potential smoothly follows the corresponding squared one ( figure  [ potential ] ) .",
    "while the continuous potential is defined by five parameters ( plus the cutoff distance and two additional constants ) , the squared potential is defined by only three parameters : @xmath11 , the repulsive width @xmath28 of the shoulder and the attractive width @xmath29 of the well .",
    "a straightforward correspondence between the two types of potential can be established by choosing the same @xmath11 , the same @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the squared potential is more appropriate for a systematic study of the phase diagram changes for different combinations of parameters .",
    "this analysis has been performed in refs .",
    "the continuous potential , on the other hand , resembles effective pair potentials obtained from the second - order pseudo - potential perturbation theory for liquid alkaline - earth metals , such as magnesium , calcium , strontium and barium near the melting point @xcite , or effective potentials for colloidal mono - layers at the water - air interface given by inversion of structural data @xcite .    moreover , the angle - average of several asymmetric water potentials give rise to isotropic soft - core effective interactions , such as the one studied in refs . @xcite .",
    "hence , the continuous potential appears to be a more realistic model for different problems .",

    "we record pressure and potential energy every @xmath52 md steps . for the calculation of the averages we consider only the data corresponding to states that are stable within the simulation time , as follows from the analysis of the time series of pressure , average temperature , and potential energy .",
    "usually an equilibration time of @xmath53 md steps is enough to reach a stable state .",
    "we average the data binned in @xmath54 consecutive md steps , a time that we test to be enough to decorrelate the data for the considered state points .    for densities",

    "@xcite , and we use for the averages only the data corresponding to the metastable liquid state .",

    "hence , the continuous potential studied here behaves like a squared potential less attractive than the one that would be in straightforward correspondence with it .",

    "<S> soft - core attractive potentials can give rise to a phase diagram with three fluid phases at different densities ( gas , low - density liquid and high - density liquid ) , separated by first order phase transition lines ending in critical points . </S>",
    "<S> experiments show a phase diagram with these features for phosphorous and triphenyl - phosphite . liquid - liquid phase transition could be relevant for water , silica , liquid metals , colloids and protein solutions , among others . </S>",
    "<S> here we compare two potentials with short - range soft - core repulsion and narrow attraction . </S>",
    "<S> one of them is a squared potential that is known to have liquid - liquid phase transition , ending in a critical point , and no anomaly in density </S>",
    "<S> . the normal , monotonic , behavior of density for isobaric cooling is surprising if compared with molecular liquids , such as water , where a hypothetical critical point is proposed as rationale for the anomalous behavior of density . </S>",
    "<S> the second potential is a continuous version of the first . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the phase diagram associated to this new potential has , not only the liquid - liquid phase transition , but also the density anomaly . </S>",
    "<S> our result , therefore , shows that the behavior in density is strongly dependent on the derivative of the potential . </S>",
