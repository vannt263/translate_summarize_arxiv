    "the anderson impurity model ( aim ) , in which a single , locally correlated orbital couples to a non - interacting metallic band of electrons , is a longstanding paradigm of strongly - correlated electron physics .",
    "conceived originally@xcite to explain the formation of localized magnetic moments on impurities in non - magnetic hosts , it has since formed the cornerstone of our understanding of the kondo effect@xcite and related many - body phenomena .",
    "interest in the area is currently particularly strong , both experimentally and theoretically , after the kondo effect was predicted@xcite and then directly confirmed@xcite to arise in mesoscopic quantum dot systems.@xcite    after some 50 years of intense theoretical work , the spin-@xmath0 kondo effect as manifest in anderson s original model is naturally rather well understood@xcite .",
    "below some characteristic kondo temperature @xmath1 , a complex many - body state develops in which the impurity spin is completely screened by the host metal , leading at low energies to a ` local ' fermi - liquid and universal transport properties .",
    "being a low - energy phenomenon , the kondo effect is of course crucially dependent on both conduction band states near the fermi level and the low - energy spin degrees of freedom of the impurity .",
    "this has inspired much research into other quantum impurity models  involving more complex impurities and/or host densities of states  with the aim of identifying the various types of kondo effect that may arise , the conditions under which they do so , and the novel physics that results when kondo screening can not be achieved@xcite .",
    "here we consider the notionally simple problem of an anderson impurity in a gapped host , where the density of states vanishes over a finite range about the chemical potential , a model not only of relevance to anderson impurities in semiconductors but also@xcite to the topical issue of impurities in bcs superconductors@xcite . in removing the all - important low - lying states of the host",
    ", one would certainly expect the kondo effect to be precluded for large enough gaps : the question is , can the effect still arise for sufficiently - small gaps , or is it destroyed as soon as a gap is opened ?",
    "this question has indeed been the subject of a number of previous papers .",
    "poor man s scaling , the @xmath2 expansion and the non - crossing approximation predict @xcite that the kondo effect always arises whenever the gap is less than the kondo temperature in the absence of the gap , while for larger gaps the system undergoes a quantum phase transition to an ` local moment ' ( lm ) phase where the impurity spin remains unscreened as @xmath3 .",
    "in addition the problem has been studied numerically by the density - matrix renormalization group@xcite and quantum monte carlo@xcite , but with no general consensus reached regarding the nature of the quantum phase transition .",
    "the numerical renormalization group ( nrg)@xcite on the other hand has been used to argue that the fermi - liquid regime associated with the kondo effect exists only away from particle  hole - symmetry , and then only below a certain critical gap . in the particle - hole ",
    "symmetric limit it is found@xcite that the kondo effect _",
    "never _ arises and the ground state is the doubly - degenerate lm phase for arbitrarily small gaps .",

    "in addition to confirming the basic predictions of the nrg study  @xcite , our analysis provides a number of exact results , including the analogue of the friedel sum rule , which serve as touchstones for approximate theories of the gapped aim ( gaim ) . in a subsequent paper@xcite ,",
