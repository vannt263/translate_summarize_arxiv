    "in common with all observed forms of classical matter , the spin - one fields described by the maxwell and proca equations obey the weak energy condition ( wec ) . that is , the stress - energy tensor @xmath0 obeys @xmath1 for all timelike vectors @xmath2 . in classical general relativity ,",
    "energy conditions such as the wec play a key role in many important results , notably the singularity theorems of penrose @xcite and hawking @xcite .",
    "moreover , since any metric solves the einstein equations for some choice of stress - energy tensor , it is arguable that general relativity has limited predictive power in the absence of such conditions",
    ".    however , all classical energy conditions are violated by quantum fields , as has been known for many years  @xcite .",
    "typically , the energy density at a given spacetime point is unbounded from below as a function of the state .",
    "specific examples of negative energy states are provided by highly squeezed states of light in quantum optics , the casimir vacuum state for a quantized field between uncharged perfectly conducting parallel planar plates and the boulware vacuum state outside a black holes . replacing the classical stress - energy tensor on the right hand side of einstein s equation with its quantum expectation value , we must therefore allow for negative energy sources , raising the possibility of exotic phenomena within the realm of semiclassical gravity .",
    "for example , negative energy can be used to maintain static traversable wormholes  @xcite , create naked singularities , travel faster than light  @xcite , and travel backward through time  @xcite . in negative energy models studied by parker and fulling",
    "it is even possible to avoid the cosmological singularity  , thus threatening to overthrow the classical singularity theorems .",
    "one might also expect that negative energy fluxes could lead to macroscopic violations of the second law of thermodynamics  @xcite .",
    "of course , macroscopic violations of the second law are not observed in nature .",
    "motivated by these thermodynamic considerations , ford  @xcite deduced that the negative fluxes and energy densities of quantum fields must be subject to constraints , at least on average .",
    "these constraints , known as _ quantum inequalities _ , or qi , provide state - independent lower bounds on certain weighted averages of the stress - energy tensor .",
    "they may therefore be regarded as the remnants of the classical energy conditions after quantisation ; thus , for example , the analogue of the wec is sometimes referred to as a _ quantum weak energy inequality _ or qwei .",
    "such bounds typically take the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the weight , or sampling function , @xmath5 is a smooth timelike curve , parametrised by proper time @xmath6 and with four - velocity @xmath7 , and @xmath8 denotes the stress - energy tensor , normal ordered with respect to some reference state @xmath9 .",
    "the significant point is that the bound @xmath10 is independent of the state @xmath11 . the class of states @xmath11 for which the bound holds",
    "must also be delineated ",
    "all bounds in the literature require ( at least ) that @xmath11 and @xmath9 be hadamard states , although this can be weakened slightly .",
    "of course the normal ordered energy density differs from the renormalised energy density by the ( renormalised ) energy density of the reference state .",
    "accordingly , eq .  ( [ eq : qityp ] ) may easily be converted into a bound on the renormalised energy density .    as we will shortly describe , various authors have established qwei s for the scalar and dirac fields in different circumstances , leading up to general results valid in curved spacetimes .",
    "the main aim of the present paper is to establish similar qwei s for the maxwell and proca fields in general globally hyperbolic spacetimes . in order to do this ,",
    "we have also made a detailed study of the field theories concerned , particularly in relation to the class of hadamard states .",
    "several new results obtained here may therefore be of more general interest .",
    "as already mentioned , the earliest work on quantum inequalities is due to ford , who established a bound on negative energy fluxes for scalar fields in 1991  @xcite .",
    "the first qwei was obtained for the massless , minimally - coupled scalar field in minkowski spacetime by ford and roman  , who established the inequality  ( [ eq : qityp ] ) for the case of an inertial worldline @xmath5 and with @xmath12 taking the lorentzian form @xmath13 , in which @xmath14 sets the characteristic timescale for the averaging . in four dimensions ,",
    "the resulting bound was @xmath15 these results were then extended by ford and roman to the massive scalar field in minkowski space   and were further extended by pfenning and ford to minimally - coupled scalar fields of arbitrary mass in ultrastatic curved spacetimes @xcite . in these generalisations , it was found that the dominant term of the qwei has a form similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : qi ] ) , but with subdominant correction terms due to the curvature and the mass of the field . pfenning and ford also showed that one could express the bound on the right hand side of the qwei in terms of derivatives of the euclidean green s function for the spacetime and developed a short sampling time approximation to the qwei which could be used in spacetimes where it would be too hard to calculate the exact qwei bound .",
    "the restriction to the lorentzian weight @xmath16 was removed by various authors . by making use of the conformal properties of field theories in two dimensions ,",
    "flanagan @xcite has derived optimal quantum inequalities for the massless scalar field for arbitrary smooth positive sampling functions , and vollick has done the same for the dirac field @xcite .",
    "qwei s for the minimally coupled scalar field in static curved spacetimes of any dimension for an arbitrary sampling function were established by fewster in work with eveson   and teo  .",
    "more recently , techniques drawn from microlocal analysis have been used to considerably generalise previous qwei s and to put them on a mathematically rigorous footing .",
    "fewster  @xcite used these techniques to derive a qwei for minimally coupled scalar fields in general globally hyperbolic spacetimes ( the most general class on which the klein ",
    "gordon equation is well - posed ) . in this case , averaging takes place along an arbitrary timelike worldline , using any weight of the form @xmath17 for @xmath18 smooth , real - valued and compactly supported .",
    "subsequently , fewster and verch established similar results for the dirac and majorana fields in four - dimensional globally hyperbolic spacetimes  . averaging over spacetime volumes",
    "has been considered by helfer  @xcite , also in great generality .",
    "previous work on qweis for spin - one fields has focussed on the electromagnetic field , beginning with the work of ford and roman  , who derived a qwei for the case of lorentzian sampling along inertial trajectories in minkowski space . more recently",
    ", pfenning  @xcite has derived a qwei for the electromagnetic field in static curved spacetimes with arbitrary positive weight sampling functions by using the techniques developed for the scalar field in  . using similar techniques ,",
    "marecki  @xcite has derived bounds on the fluctuations of the electric field strength , which are of interest in quantum optics .    in this paper",
    "we will adapt the methods of  @xcite to the maxwell and proca fields .",
    "this depends crucially on the fact , first discovered by radzikowski  @xcite for scalar fields , that the class of hadamard states may be characterised in terms of a wave - front set condition on the two - point function .",
    "similar reformulations are known for the dirac field   but there is as yet no full treatment for the maxwell and proca fields in the literature .",
    "( see , however ,   for [ non - microlocal ] discussions of hadamard states for electromagnetism using faddeev  popov ghosts . )",
    "our treatment of this issue has been influenced to some extent by the forthcoming work of junker and lled  @xcite , although it has been conducted largely independently , leading to some technical differences with their approach  .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "the maxwell and proca fields are most elegantly described using differential forms ; accordingly , we begin in section  [ sec : prelims ] with a description of our conventions for differential forms and other geometric objects which will appear in this paper . in particular , we delineate the class of globally hyperbolic spacetimes to be considered ; for technical reasons it is convenient to assume that their cauchy surfaces are compact and have trivial first homology group .",
    "this is followed by a brief introduction to microlocal analysis leading to the definition of the wave - front set for @xmath19-form distributions .    in sec .",
    "[ sect : quantisation ] we describe the quantisation of the maxwell and proca fields in globally hyperbolic spacetimes .",
    "we adopt an algebraic approach , giving a direct construction of algebras of observables equivalent to those obtained by dimock  @xcite and furlani  @xcite .",
    "we also define the notion of a hadamard state for these fields , as a state whose two - point function  ) .",
    "in particular , it is not a distribution . ]",
    "is related in a certain way to a one - form _ klein  gordon _",
    "bisolution of hadamard form .",
    "such bisolutions and their microlocal properties have been discussed in detail by sahlmann and verch  ; we may therefore read off the microlocal properties of the maxwell and proca two - point functions in hadamard states .",
    "this permits us to apply the methods of  @xcite to obtain quantum inequalities for these fields in sec .",
    "[ sect : qwei ] . before this , in sec .",
    "[ sect : ultra ] , we specialise to the class of ultrastatic spacetimes in order to gain further insight into the abstract definitions of sec .  [",
    "sect : quantisation ] .",
    "in particular , we prove the existence of hadamard states in these spacetimes and use deformation arguments  @xcite to deduce from this the existence of hadamard states in general globally hyperbolic spacetimes obeying our topological restrictions .",
    "we also compare our approach with other quantisation schemes , including the gupta  bleuler method .",
    "as mentioned above , we expect that some of the results obtained here to be of wider interest .    in sec .",
    "[ sect : examples ] we investigate our qwei in minkowski space , and in general ultrastatic spacetimes ( modulo the usual topological conditions ) .",
    "simple formulae are obtained for the qwei bound , which are readily compared with those previously obtained for the scalar field . in minkowski space ,",
    "the qwei bound is weaker by a factor of exactly two for the maxwell field ( as already noted in  @xcite ) and by a factor of three for the proca field .",
    "this is not very surprising and simply reflects the number of spin degrees of freedom . in curved spacetime , however , the spin - one and scalar qweis can not be related in this fashion . to emphasise this , we explicitly determine the qwei bound in the einstein static universe , providing a concrete example of our ultrastatic qwei .",
