    "quantum estimation of states , observables and parameters is , from very basic principles , matter of statistical inference after sampling a population .",
    "why is it so ? and what does this statement exactly mean ?",
    "the quantum description of a physical system is intrinsically a statistical one since given an unknown quantum state @xmath0 : i ) one can not determine the quantum state from a single measurement ( even joint measurement ) performed on the system @xcite ; ii ) it is not possible to measure different observables after copying the state preparation at disposal , since the linearity of quantum mechanics leads to the impossibility of cloning an arbitrary state @xcite . in a way , this means that any quantum estimation procedure necessary requires many identical preparations of the system under examination , on which one performs repeated measurements of an observable or of a set of observables .",
    "the full inference of the quantum state from feasible measurements is a hot topic of the last decade . in recent years",
    ", experiments have been performed to characterize the quantum state of different physical systems , such as single - mode radiation field @xcite , a diatomic molecule @xcite , a trapped ion @xcite , and an atomic beam @xcite .",
    "these results stimulated some efforts for efficient data - processing algorithms , in order to extract the maximum available information on the quantum state , since one always deals with finite ensembles @xcite , and every detection scheme is affected by noise and imperfections .",
    "the need for an efficient data processing is even more stringent in cases where one is not interested in the complete characterization of the state , but only in some specific feature , as when one addresses the problem of characterizing a device , rather than a quantum state , as , for example , the estimation of coupling constants , gain coefficients , or nonlinear susceptibilities .",
    "the most comprehensive quantum estimation procedure is quantum tomography @xcite . in quantum tomography",
    "the expectation value of an operator is obtained by averaging a special function ( usually termed _ sampling kernel _ or _",
    "pattern function _ ) over the experimental data of a sufficiently complete set of observables which is called a `` quorum '' .",
    "for example , in homodyne tomography of radiation the quorum observables are the quadratures of the e.m . field ( for varying phase with respect to the local oscillator ) .",
    "the expectation value of a generic operator is obtained by averaging the corresponding pattern function over data .",
    "the method is very general and efficient , however , in the averaging procedure , we have fluctuations which result in large statistical errors .",
    "in this paper we review the the maximum - likelihood ( ml ) principle approach to the quantum estimation problem .",
    "the ml idea is to find the quantum state , or the value of the parameters , that are most likely to generate the observed data .",
    "this idea can be quantified and implemented using the concept of the likelihood functional .",
    "concerning the estimation of quantum state , in contrast to quantum tomography , the ml method estimates the state as a whole . as a result , _ a priori _ knowledge about properties of the density matrix can be incorporated from the very beginning , thus assuring positivity and normalization of matrix , with the result of a substantial reduction of statistical errors @xcite . regarding the estimation of specific parameters",
    ", we notice that in all the cases here analyzed the resulting estimators are efficient , unbiased and consistent , thus providing a statistically reliable determination @xcite .",
    "moreover , by using the ml method only small samples of data are required for a precise determination .",
    "here we briefly review the theory of the maximum - likelihood ( ml ) estimation of a single parameter .",
    "the generalization to several parameters , as for example the elements of the density matrix is , in principle , straightforward .",
    "the only point that should be carefully analyzed is the parameterization of the multidimensional quantity to be estimated . in the next section",
    "the specific case of the density matrix will be discussed .",
    "let @xmath1 the probability density of a random variable @xmath2 , conditioned to the value of the parameter @xmath3 .",
    "the form of @xmath4 is known , but the true value of the parameter @xmath3 is unknown , and will be estimated from the result of a measurement of @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath5 be a random sample of size @xmath6 .",
    "the joint probability density of the independent random variable @xmath5 ( the global probability of the sample ) is given by @xmath7 and is called the likelihood function of the given data sample ( hereafter we will suppress the dependence of @xmath8 on the data ) .",
    "the maximum - likelihood estimator ( mle ) of the parameter @xmath3 is defined as the quantity @xmath9 that maximizes @xmath10 for variations of @xmath3 , namely @xmath11 is given by the solution of the equations @xmath12 since the likelihood is positive the first equation is equivalent to @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the so - called log - likelihood function .    in order to obtain a measure for the confidence interval in the determination of @xmath11 we consider the variance @xmath15   \\left[\\lambda_{\\sc ml }   ( \\{x_k\\})- \\lambda \\right]^2 \\ : \\label{varmledef}\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] upon defining the fisher information @xmath16 ^ 2 \\frac1{p(x | \\lambda ) } \\label{fisherdef}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is easy to prove @xcite that @xmath17 where @xmath6 is the number of measurements . the inequality in eq . ( [ manca ] )",
    "is known as the cramr - rao bound @xcite on the precision of ml estimation .",
    "notice that this bound holds for any functional form of the probability distribution @xmath18 , provided that the fisher information exists @xmath19 and @xmath20 exists @xmath21 . when an experiment has `` good statistics '' ( i.e. a data sample large enough ) the cramr - rao bound is saturated .",
    "in this section we review the the method for the maximum likelihood estimation of the quantum state , focusing attention to the cases of homodyne and spin tomographies @xcite .",
    "the physical situation we have in mind is an experiment consisting of @xmath6 measurements performed on identically prepared copies of a given system .",
    "quantum mechanically , each measurement is described by a positive operator - valued measure ( povm ) .",
    "the outcome of the @xmath22th measurement corresponds to the realization of a specific element of the povm used in the corresponding run .",
    "we denote this element by @xmath23 .",
    "the likelihood is here a functional of the density matrix @xmath24 and is given by the product @xmath25 which represents the probability of the observed data .",
    "the unknown element of the above expression , which we want to infer from data , is the density matrix describing the measured ensemble .",
    "we restrict ourselves to finite dimensional hilbert spaces . in this case",
    ", it can be proved that @xmath24 is a concave function defined on a convex and closed set of density matrices .",
    "therefore , its maximum is achieved either on a single isolated point , or on a convex subset of density matrices . in the first case we have a proper reconstruction scheme , namely the set of observables chosen for the measurement provides the complete characterization of the state under examinations . on the other hand ,",
    "if the maximum is not unique , the set of chosen observables is insufficient , namely it does not constitute a quorum .    in order to optimize the procedure for the maximization of the likelihood function",
    "we introduce a specific parameterization of the set of density matrices .",
    "a given density matrix can be written in the form @xmath26 which automatically guarantees that @xmath27 is positive and hermitian for any complex lower triangular matrix @xmath28 , with real elements on the diagonal .",
    "for an @xmath29-dimensional hilbert space , the number of real parameters in the matrix @xmath30 is @xmath31 , which equals the number of independent real parameters for a hermitian matrix .",
    "this confirms that our parameterization is minimal , up to the unit trace condition .    in numerical calculations ,",
    "it is convenient to replace the likelihood functional by its natural logarithm , which does not change the location of the maximum . thus the function subjected to numerical maximization is given by @xmath32 where @xmath3 is a lagrange multiplier accounting for normalization of @xmath33 that equals the total number of measurements @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "using this formulation , the maximization problem can be solved by standard numerical procedures for searching the maximum over the @xmath34 real parameters of the matrix @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the examples presented below use the downhill simplex method @xcite .",
    "our first example is the application of the ml estimation in quantum homodyne tomography of a single - mode radiation field @xcite , which is so far the most successful method in measuring nonclassical states of light @xcite .",
    "the experimental apparatus used in this technique is the homodyne detector .",
    "the realistic , imperfect homodyne measurement is described by the positive operator - valued measure @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the detector efficiency , and @xmath37 is the quadrature operator ( @xmath38=1 $ ] ) , depending on the externally adjustable local oscillator ( lo ) phase @xmath39 .    after repeating the measurement @xmath6 times",
    ", we obtain a set of pairs @xmath40 consisting of the outcome @xmath41 and the lo phase @xmath42 for the @xmath22th run , where @xmath43 .",
    "the log - likelihood functional is given by eq .",
    "( [ loglik ] ) with @xmath44 .",
    "of course , for a light mode it is necessary to truncate the hilbert space to a finite dimensional basis .",
    "we shall assume that the highest fock state has @xmath45 photons , i.e.  that the dimension of the truncated hilbert space is @xmath29 .",
    "for the expectation @xmath46 $ ] it is necessary to use an expression which is explicitly positive , in order to protect the algorithm against occurrence of small negative numerical arguments of the logarithm function . a simple derivation yields @xmath47    =   \\sum_{k=0}^{m-1}\\sum_{j=0}^{k } \\left|\\sum_{n=0}^{k - j }   \\langle k | \\hat{t } | n+j \\rangle b_{n+j , n } \\langle n | x\\rangle e^{in\\varphi}\\right|^2 \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48^{1/2 } $ ] and @xmath49 are eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator in the position representation@xmath50 being the @xmath51th hermite polynomial .",
    "we have applied the ml technique to reconstruct the density matrix in the fock basis from monte carlo simulated homodyne statistics @xcite .",
    "[ fig : qht ] depicts the matrix elements of the density operator as obtained for a coherent state and a squeezed vacuum .",
    "remarkably , only 50000 homodyne data have been used for quantum efficiency at photodetectors @xmath52 .",

    "the statistical error of the reconstructed number probability affects the third decimal digit , and is not visible on the scale of the plot .    as a further development , we mention that the ml estimation of gaussian wigner functions also provides a technique to estimate the coupling constants of quadratic hamiltonians of the form @xmath91 hamiltonians like that in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) describes the interaction of light modes in active optical medium characterized by a second order susceptibility tensor .",
    "actually , the unitary evolution operator @xmath92 preserves the gaussian form of an input state with gaussian wigner function , and therefore one can use a gaussian state to probe and characterize an optical device .",
    "the operation of a photodetector is , in principle , very simple : each photon ionizes an atom , and the resulting charge is amplified to produce a measurable pulse . in practice , however , available photodetectors are usually characterized by a quantum efficiency lower than unity , which means that only a fraction of the incoming photons lead to an electric pulse , and ultimately to a `` count '' .",
    "we may distinguish two main classes of photodetectors .",
    "in the first we have detectors where the resulting current proportional to the incoming photon flux : in this case we have a linear photodetector .",
    "for example , this is the case of the high flux photodetectors used in homodyne detection . in the second class",
    "we have photodetectors operating at very low intensities , which resort to avalanche process in order to transform a single ionization event into a recordable pulse .",
    "this implies that one can not discriminate between a single photon or many photons as the outcomes from such detectors are either a `` click '' , corresponding to any number of photons , or `` nothing '' which means that no photons have been revealed",
    ".    conventional characterization of photodetectors resorts to prepare a reference state with known intensity , and then measuring which fraction of the signal is actually revealed .",
    "this unavoidably leads to rather poor performances when applied in the relevant regime of quantum signals .",
    "detection losses , in facts , distorce the whole probability distribution of the quantity being measured , not only the average value .",
    "moreover , we need the accurate knowledge of the quantum state of the reference signal . in the following ,",
    "we apply the ml principle to the absolute estimation of the quantum efficiency of both linear and avalanche photodetectors .",
    "we show that , along with the reliable characterization of quantum signals , ml method is an effective and statistically efficient tool for characterizing the response of a photodetector to low - intensity and/or nonclassical states .",
    "let us first study the case of linear photodetectors . as a reference state we consider a squeezed - coherent state , measured by homodyne detection .",
    "the effect of non - unit quantum efficiency @xmath36 on the probability distribution of homodyne detection is twofold .",
    "we have both a rescaling of the mean value and a broadening of the distribution . for a squeezed state @xmath93 with the direction of squeezing parallel to the signal phase and to the phase of the homodyne detection ( without loss of generality we set this phase equal to zero and @xmath94 ) we have @xcite @xmath95\\qquad \\delta^2 = \\frac14   \\left(e^{-2r}+1-\\eta\\right)\\label{pheta}\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the total number of photons of the state",

    "the performances of the ml estimation can be compared to the `` naive '' estimation based only on the measurement of the mean value , i.e. @xmath100 .",
    "we expect the naive method to be less efficient , since the quantum efficiency not only rescales the mean value , but also spreads the variance of the homodyne distribution in eq .",
