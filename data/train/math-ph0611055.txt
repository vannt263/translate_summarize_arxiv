    "a well known result quoted in popular fiction is that of the  gravity elevator . \"",
    "the result consists of the fact that an object released through a hole through the center of the earth undergoes simple harmonic motion with a period slightly under 1@xmath0 hours .",
    "it is straightforward to show that this result holds true for any chord through the earth ; thus , one may consider a  gravity elevator \" which shuttles between any two points on the earth s surface in approximately 42 minutes .",
    "such a path is not the path of minimum time , as can be seen by objects undergoing small oscillations at the surface of the earth .",
    "we consider , then , the following problem : determine the path of minimum time ( brachistochrone ) between two points on the surface of a spherical , uniformly distributed mass ; i.e. the  fastest gravity elevator . \"    the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "we initially show a simple derivation for the gravity elevator result .",
    "we then review the solution of the brachistochrone problem in a uniform gravitational field using the calculus of variations .",
    "finally , we extend this approach to solve for the spherical problem . finally , we show the two solutions agree in the limit of small path length to mass radius ratio .",
