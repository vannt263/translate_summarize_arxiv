    "the wave of colonization by migrating farmers and establishment of farming communities in europe between @xmath0 and @xmath1 bc is currently a topic of great interest in prehistoric archaeology , linguistics and anthropology ch , pr .",
    "ammerman and cavalli - sforza developed a model for the expansion of farming as a demic diffusion which spread into europe in the form of wave of advance @xcite . using the radiocarbon dates",
    ", they found that farmers spread at an average rate of about one kilometer a year .",
    "interest in simulation and spatial modelling of spread of agriculture has been growing rapidly in the last decade , especially in the physics community @xcite .",
    "one of the main reasons for this is that the geographical spread of population can be effectively described by the classical fisher - kpp equation and its various generalizations @xcite .",
    "these models have attracted considerable interest in physics and biology , because of the huge number of potential applications .",
    "fort and mendez have applied a time - delayed theory for the neolithic transition @xcite which involves a hyperbolic correction to the fisher - kpp equation . the transition from hunter - gathering",
    "to farming did not happen in a uniform way , and that is why davison et al .",
    "have taken into account both advection and spatial variation in diffusivity and carrying capacity , in the framework of the fisher - kpp equation @xcite .",
    "aoki and shida @xcite have studied the spread of farmers into an area occupied by hunter - gatherers in terms of a system of reaction - diffusion equations . the main objective of those works was to reproduce the observed rate at which agricultural expansion took place in europe . despite the interest in establishment of farming communities in europe",
    ", there remains no published material on the spatial structure formed behind the wave of advance .",
    "the main challenge of our work presented below is to set up a model which provides an explanation to not only the propagation of farming but also the formation of human settlements .",
    "we develop a model that demonstrates the tendency of the distribution of population to form clusters , and furthermore , that this large - scale pattern in population evolution is a transient phenomenon , which disappears due to degradation of land in the form of an extinction wave .",
    "our specific motivation is the successive migration of settlements along parallel river valleys in the tripolye - cucuteni system , which has been thoroughly investigated and documented , e.g. @xcite .",
    "this system can be considered as being one - dimensional , and so is particularly amenable to numerical investigation .",
    "in our model the population consists of semi - sedentary foragers and sedentary farmers who share the same territories .",
    "the semi - sedentary foragers are the population of individuals randomly moving from place to place along a river valley and searching for food and other resources .",
    "an implicit consequence of this behaviour is the foundation of new settlements ( large localized values of population density ) , and an interchange between farming and foraging populations . on the contrary the sedentary farmers are individuals who do not migrate .",
    "they live in small villages scattered near cultivated land in the major river valleys .",
    "their main activities are the cultivation of soil and crop production . in this paper",
    "we are interested in the total population density @xmath2 at location @xmath3 along the river at time @xmath4 we define this density as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the density of semi - sedentary foragers and @xmath7 is the density of sedentary farmers .",
    "we assume that there is not a strict distinction between foraging and sedentary lifestyles .",
    "there are always random transitions from a sedentary to a foraging way of life , and _",
    "vice versa _ ; these transitions depend strongly on the local food supply .",
    "this is one of the main features of our random walk model . regarding the movement of semi - sedentary foragers ,",
    "they do not jump from place to place completely randomly . unlike brownian particles in physics , the migration of people can not be explained by a standard diffusion law , in which the flux is proportional to the gradient of number density of individuals . to describe the random migration of semi - sedentary foragers and random transitions from one lifestyle to another",
    "we adopt a biased random walk whose statistical characteristics depend on the local food supply . in our model ,",
    "the probability of a random migration event making a jump @xmath8 in the time interval @xmath9 to @xmath10 is @xmath11 the probability of transition from foraging lifestyle to the farming is @xmath12 the probability of the conversion of farmers to semi - sedentary foragers is @xmath13 thus we introduce a new variable , the local crop production per individual per year @xmath14 so that the frequency of jumps @xmath15 and transition rates @xmath16 and @xmath17 depend on the crop production : @xmath18it is natural to assume that the frequency @xmath19 is a decreasing function of @xmath20 that is , when sedentary farmers are not able to produce enough food to sustain their population , some of them start to migrate from their neighborhood at rate @xmath21 .",
    "we now set up the balance equation for the density of semi - sedentary foragers , @xmath22 according to our random walk model , the density of foragers @xmath6 at location @xmath3 at time @xmath23 can be written as follows @xmath24this equation is a conservation law for foragers .",
    "the first term on the right hand side represents those foragers who stay at location @xmath3 and do not move during time @xmath25 and do not become sedentary farmers .",
    "the second term gives the number of foragers who arrive at @xmath3 during time @xmath25 from different places @xmath26 , where the jump distance @xmath8 is distributed by dispersal kernel @xmath27 the last term is the number of sedentary farmers who become the semi - sedentary foragers during the time @xmath28    the sedentary farmers do not migrate , and their density @xmath29 obeys the balance equation involving logistic growth and lifestyle transitions : @xmath30where @xmath31 is the growth rate of the sedentary population . the carrying capacity @xmath32 is in general , an increasing function of the local crop production @xmath33 .",
    "the last term gives the number of foragers who become the farmers during the time @xmath28 in the limit @xmath34 , from ( [ n1 ] ) and ( [ n2 ] ) we obtain two differential equations for @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xmath37@xmath38    in this paper we are interested in the evolution of population density @xmath2 on characteristic time scales around @xmath39 years .",
    "therefore we can adopt a local equilibrium for the two populations , describing the balance between the nomadic and sedentary ways of life in proportions @xmath40 and @xmath41 we write @xmath42where the proportion of foragers @xmath40 is the function of the crop production @xmath43 @xmath44 in the asymptotic regime when  @xmath45 one can write the dependence of @xmath40 on the transition rates @xmath46 and @xmath47 as @xmath48the evolution equation for biased migration ( [ nnn1 ] ) and population growth ( [ nnn2 ] ) can be rewritten as one balance equation for the total population density@xmath49 by adding equations ( [ nnn1 ] ) and ( [ nnn2 ] ) and using ( [ main ] ) we obtain a single equation for @xmath2 @xmath50now we need to find an approximate form for the function @xmath51 it is natural to assume that for a large crop production @xmath52 the population mostly consists of sedentary farmers , that is , @xmath40 close to zero , while for a low crop production the population mostly is semi - sedentary foragers ( @xmath40 is close to one ) . a simple approximation for @xmath40 might be @xmath53where @xmath54 is the heaviside step function : @xmath55 if @xmath56 @xmath57 if @xmath58 thus farmers do not migrate if the crop supply is greater than a critical value @xmath59 . in our numerical simulations we use a piece - wise approximation : a linearly decreasing function in the interval between the minimum value @xmath59 and the maximum value @xmath60 @xmath61based on @xcite , we take @xmath62 kg per person per year respectively . for the results discussed below we set @xmath63 , @xmath64 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) but the exact values are not crucial to our results .    the dispersal kernel @xmath65 is assumed to have two cutoffs : a minimum cutoff ( foragers do not travel very small distances ) and a maximum cutoff ( foragers do not migrate over very large distances in a single jump ) . in numerical simulations we use minimum cutoff @xmath66 of between @xmath67 and @xmath68 km . the maximum cutoff is more difficult to estimate .",
    "however , since the typical length of the river is around @xmath69 km , it seems reasonable to assume that the maximum cutoff is around @xmath70 km ( see fig .",
    "we assume that the human population derives most of their food from the cultivation of land .",
    "thus we suggest the following formula for the local food production @xmath71 @xmath72where @xmath73 is the density of soil nutrients , @xmath74 is the production rate coefficient , and @xmath75 is the parameter that determines how the yield depends on the nutrients .",
    "this equation describes how the rate of food supply @xmath33 increases due to the increase in the population density @xmath76 , and how the degradation of land ( the decrease of soil nutrients @xmath77 leads to a decrease of food production through the factor @xmath78 note that the factor @xmath79 describes a tendency toward group solidarity that increases the efficiency of food production .",
    "we know from existing data that the yield , i.e. the production of food per unit area , can be up to @xmath80 kg / m@xmath81year @xcite.we estimate that the area cultivated by people is approximately @xmath82 m@xmath81 per person .",
    "thus , we have an estimate for @xmath83 of @xmath84 kg per person per year . in general , it is difficult to model how the production of food depends on the nutrients , since this relation is strongly dependent on the environmental conditions .",
    "one of the existing models is given by the mitscherlich - baule yield response @xcite which takes into account productivity losses due to soil erosion .",
    "following this model , in @xcite the factor @xmath85 has been proposed , and this is what we have introduced into our model .",
    "the value @xmath86 m@xmath81kg@xmath87 is found for the corn cultivation .",
    "however , other studies @xcite seem to suggest lower values ( @xmath88 m@xmath89kg@xmath87 ) .    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     we also explored the dependence of the speed of population advance , and the separation of the clusters , as a function of the parameters .",
    "the speed of advance is rather ill - defined , but for simplicity we monitored the movement of the main peak of the distribution .",
    "( arguably we could have , e.g. , studied the position of the cluster furthest from the origin . )",
    "we found that the speed of advance depends approximately linearly on both @xmath90 and @xmath91 , and to be insensitive to @xmath92 .",
    "the separation of clusters is independent of both @xmath90 and @xmath91 and depends approximately linearly on @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) . if @xmath94 or @xmath95 the clustering phenomenon does not occur .",
    "while we have concentrated our efforts on studying variation among a manageable subset of parameters while retaining fixed plausible values for the others , we did also make a small study of the effects of varying @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "increasing the value of @xmath96 , up to @xmath98 from our canonical value of @xmath99 , prolongs the timescale of the population evolution , by a factor of up to about @xmath100 .",
    "values of @xmath96 significantly smaller than @xmath99 do not give clustering for typical choices of the other parameters .",
    "it means that for non - fertile soils transition to farming and the emergence of clusters are unlikely to occur . for larger values of @xmath101 ,",
    "the regeneration is so strong that , although clustering occurs initially much as for @xmath102 , the final state is a spatially uniform population . for smaller values of @xmath97 , e.g. @xmath103",
    ", we still see strong clustering , but the overall phenomenon persists for a significantly shorter time , as the episodes of cluster regeneration seen when @xmath102 do not now occur .",
    "we have explored a continuous model of linear ( one - dimensional ) population migration and clustering .",
    "we took our inspiration and guidance from the successive south to north migration of the tripolye - cucuteni cultures along parallel river valleys @xcite .",
    "we attempted only to illustrate the migration along a single valley .",
    "the main result is that our model gives an explanation for the formation of settlements as a dynamical phenomenon .",
    "the individuals have a tendency for aggregation and clustering as a result of non - linear random migration .",
    "moreover our model describes subsequent decay of these clusters ( settlements ) due to land degradation in the form of an extinction wave . clearly our model , being mathematically continuous ,",
    "can not be expected to reproduce in detail the essentially discrete phenomenon of the establishment , growth and decay of major settlements and their satellites , as revealed by the archaeological record  our goal is far more modest . for reasonable choices of parameters",
    "we obtain migration over distances of order @xmath69 km in times of @xmath104 yr . without fine tuning ,",
    "our solutions exhibit distinct clustering of population , at intervals of @xmath105 km .",
    "plausibly these clusters are estimated to have @xmath106 individuals .",
    "these estimates are all consistent with what is known about the tripolye - cucuteni cultures @xcite .",
    "overall , we feel that our quite naive modelling captures some of the essence of the clustering seen in population migration , and points the way for more sophisticated modelling .",
    "we can think of a number of significant developments in the future , including taking @xmath107 and allowing for a latency effect , in which population in a cluster ( ` settlement ' ) has a reduced probability of moving , representing an attachment to the investment of building a house and clearing land .",
    "it is easy to allow for additional resources available from e.g. forest or river , which are maybe harder to exhaust than the fertility of the land and so can act as a reservoir of resource",
    ". it would be interesting to apply our model to understand societal collapses to which environmental problems as habitat destruction , soil degradation and overpopulation contribute @xcite .",
