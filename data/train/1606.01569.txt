    "it was proved in @xcite that the elastic energy @xmath7 of a simple closed curve @xmath1 with curvature @xmath2 , enclosing a given amount of area , is minimal when the curve is a circle .",
    "an equivalent way to formulate the result is to say that for all @xmath1 smooth , simple and closed @xmath8 with equality only if @xmath1 is a circle .",

    "we study the non linear case with elastic energy of the form @xmath10 and we look for conditions on @xmath11 under which the circle still minimizes @xmath12 among simply connected sets of given area . +",
    "even though the reduction to the convex case is in general not straightforward , the study of convex curves , i.e. curves bounding convex domains , is a fundamental building block in the proofs of , see @xcite . for convex curves",
    "has been known since a work of gage @xcite .",
    "our first result is indeed    [ prop ] if @xmath6 and @xmath13 for @xmath14 then the disc , and only the disc , minimizes @xmath15 among convex sets @xmath16 of given area and boundary of class @xmath17 .",

    "two remarkable examples are given by @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",

    "we prove theorem [ prop ] .",
    "we first show that a sequence of convex sets with area and energy both equibounded , has also equibounded diameter . hence we prove compactness of a minimizing sequence of domains . then we show that a minimum is necessarily uniformly convex in the sense that the curvature , as an @xmath33 function , is essentially bounded away from zero . in view of the uniform convexity",
    "one can then perform a domain variation and work out the euler lagrange equation which the boundary of an energy minimizer has to satisfy .",
    "it turns out , using a result by ben andrews @xcite , that the disc is the unique stationary point and therefore also the unique energy minimizer .",

    "to prove theorem [ prop ] we need two preliminary lemmata .",
    "we parametrize a simple closed curve @xmath1 by arc length @xmath38 , with @xmath47\\rightarrow\\r^2 $ ] running counterclockwise , and we denote by @xmath48\\rightarrow[0,2\\pi]$ ] the angle between the tangent @xmath49 and @xmath50",

    "we are considering the case where @xmath2 is nonnegative and @xmath54 .",
    "minimization of @xmath55 is analogous to minimization of @xmath56 if not otherwise specified we always assume that the set @xmath16 is oriented so that @xmath57 the first result is      the proof follows from the blaschke selection theorem and the lower semicontinuity of energy once we establish the boundedness of any minimizing sequence .",

    "we observe that , since @xmath92 is constant in @xmath99\\cup[\\tfrac l2+\\eps/2,\\tfrac l2+\\eps]$ ] , the boundary of @xmath90 contains two parallel segments of length @xmath100 .",
    "then we can modify again @xmath90 by removing the shaded area as described in figure [ omega_hat ] .",
    "in view of lemma [ centrosymm ] we can now compute the euler equation for the minimizing domain @xmath16 .",

    "the variation of the functional @xmath109 reads as follows :                  if @xmath110 , we have @xmath111 , then , by arbitrariness of @xmath112 among periodic functions , equation ( [ ie ] ) becomes @xmath113 we recall that @xmath106 is periodic and we observe that @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the center of symmetry of @xmath16 .",

    "on the other hand , recalling that @xmath119 we get @xmath120 , that is @xmath121 where @xmath122 is a positive constant . we can now apply theorem 1.5 in @xcite , and we owe this idea to remark 4.1 in @xcite , to conclude that @xmath16 must be a disc .      the basic strategy is a reduction to the convex case . if @xmath16 is a simply connected smooth set with boundary @xmath123 of class @xmath24 and piecewise of class @xmath25 , then @xmath2 is well defined in all but finite number of points .",
    "to illustrate the idea we consider an easy case where the domain @xmath16 is like the one in figure [ reduction ] .",
    "assume we can find two chords that cut two disjoint convex sets , entirely contained in @xmath16 ( shaded in grey in figure [ reduction ] ) , such that the tangents to @xmath123 at the end points of each chord are parallel . by rotating the two convex sets around the midpoint of each chord",
    "we can construct two convex sets , namely @xmath75 and @xmath76 , with boundaries of class @xmath24 and piecewise of class @xmath25 .",
    "then we have @xmath124 here @xmath125 and @xmath125 are discs of same area as @xmath75 and @xmath76 respectively .",

    "therefore @xmath11 is an increasing functions in @xmath27 $ ] . as a consequence",
    "the energy @xmath55 of the boundary of a disc is a monotone decreasing function of the radius .",
    "obviously the previous proof relies on the construction of the two sets @xmath75 and @xmath76 which is not always trivial . in @xcite a set @xmath16 like the one in figure [ reduction ] was labeled as a set _ holding two disjoint convex sets . _ even if in general a set does not _ hold two disjoint convex sets _ , the proof of ( * ? ? ?",
