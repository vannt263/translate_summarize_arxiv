    "flares on the sun result from catastrophic releases of energy previously stored in strong tangled surface magnetic fields .",
    "these outbursts are most conspicuous at high energies , and under the right circumstances ( or wrong , depending on your perspective ) can profoundly impact the heliosphere and earth .",
    "this is one reason why flares have drawn intense interest from solar observers and theorists for many decades ; and indeed have spawned a vibrant space weather community in recent years .",
    "a less appreciated aspect of solar flares involves the stellar cousins , where extraordinarily large x - ray ( and even white - light ) outbursts have been recorded , in some cases dwarfing by a considerable margin the largest known flares on our own sun , albeit a middle - aged and magnetically rather uninspired star .",
    "the most extreme of these are `` superflares , '' which at high energies can exceed the quiescent coronal x - ray emission of a star by factors of a hundred or more .",
    "interest in such rare , but potentially catastrophic , events concerns how they might affect , for example , survival of primitive lifeforms struggling for existence on a semi - habitable world orbiting a young , magnetically active star .    until recently",
    ", reports of superflares mainly involved interpretations of historical materials , such as long - term astronomical plate collections , and disconnected isolated reports or inferences ( schaefer et al .",
    "now , however , the _ kepler _ mission has provided more substantive statistics on superflares  although limited to white - light counterparts  from a wide variety of stars , normal and otherwise ( e.g. , maehara et al .  2012 ;",
    "shibayama et al .",
    "2013 ; candelaresi et al .",
    "further , the _ swift _ gamma - ray burst satellite has witnessed a handful of the most extreme events , radiating in hard x - rays , thanks to its broad view of the high - energy sky and rapid pointing response ( e.g. , osten et al .",
    "2010 ; drake et al .",
    "the _ swift _ alerts also have promoted supporting multi - spectral observations of flares , especially at radio frequencies that capture non - thermal emissions from accelerated particles ( e.g. , fender et al .",
    "2015 ) . on the other hand",
    ", there have been few cases of such outbursts recorded at wavelengths where the powerful diagnostics of high - resolution spectroscopy can be brought to bear , namely the ultraviolet .",
    "the lack of good examples mostly is because these rare events are , well , rare .",
    "serendipitously , however , a recent _ hst _ cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) campaign on young ( @xmath250  myr ) solar analog ek draconis ( hd129333 ; g1.5  v ) , well - described in the previous literature ( e.g. , knig et al .",
    "2005 , and references therein ) , caught a large hour - long fuv outburst , in `` hot lines '' like the 1550    doublet ( t@xmath6  k ) and the extremely hot [ ] 1354    coronal forbidden line ( @xmath7  k ) .",
    "the ek  dra flare , viewed with the excellent spectral resolution , broad wavelength coverage , and high sensitivity of cos , provides a unique opportunity to explore properties of such events , to inform interpretations of the physical processes involved .",
    "moreover , the behavior of the fuv spectrum outside the flare , over the several days of intermittent attention by _ hst , _ opens a window onto the `` quiescent '' properties of a hyperactive chromosphere and corona , again with unprecedented clarity .",
    "there were two previous _ hst _ spectroscopic programs of note on ek  dra . in 1996 ,",
    "saar & bookbinder ( 1998 ) carried out high time resolution measurements with the low - resolution fuv grating of goddard high - resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) over a continuous interval of about six hours ( about 10% of the spin period ) .",
    "the authors identified several factor of 2 - 3 impulsive flare - like bursts in 1400    and 1550    when the light curves were binned into 30  s intervals .",
    "the identifiable hot - line emission enhancements occupied about 8% of the timeline .",
    "the remainder was attributed to `` quiescent '' periods .    a decade and a half later , in 2010 , ayres & france ( 2010 ) targeted ek  dra with newly commissioned cos as part of a larger `` snapshot '' ( partial - orbit filler observations ) survey of fuv coronal forbidden lines , such as [ ] @xmath81354 ( @xmath9  k ) , in more than a dozen late - type stars . the objective was to measure doppler profiles of high - energy coronal lines at fuv resolution , some 20 times better than currently possible in the soft x - ray band , the more natural  but spectroscopically challenged ",
    "home of coronal transitions .",
    "the cos snap observation of ek  dra covered only a short time span , about 20  minutes , compared with the earlier ghrs pointing .",
    "but , it had the important advantage of achieving moderately high spectral resolution ( @xmath10  km s@xmath1 ) in the integrated spectrum , as well as comparably high time resolution ( 30  s ) for flux measurements of key species like 1335    ( @xmath11  k ) , , and [ ] collected in the single g130 m grating setting feasible for the brief partial - orbit visit .    the doublet , in particular , exhibited twin factor of @xmath22 enhancements over the mere 20  minute interval , remarkably without comparable responses at lower temperatures ( ) or higher ( ) , contrary to expectations for normal flares , which tend to impact all the atmospheric temperature layers more - or - less simultaneously .",
    "equally remarkable , the doublet features displayed quite large _",
    "redshifts _ , about 20  km s@xmath1 , relative to narrow chromospheric features ( which set the empirical zero - point velocity for the cos exposures )",
    ".    redshifts of the hot lines are well documented on the sun , attributed to nearly radial downflows of subcoronal material , but the average shifts in a disk - integrated spectrum might be only a few km  s@xmath1 or less ( peter 2006 ) .",
    "ayres & france interpreted the large redshifts of on ek  dra as a signature of a scaled up version of solar `` coronal rain : '' previously hot multi - mk gas suspended high in magnetic loops rapidly cooling and draining back down to the lower atmosphere , perhaps  in the case of ek  dra  in a catastrophic way ( what one might call an _ anti - flare : _ impulsive cooling rather than heating ) .",
    "the follow - up _ hst _ program , described here , partnered the high sensitivity of cos with the excellent wavelength precision of stis to explore alternative explanations for the cos redshifts , and thus also the coronal rain hypothesis : ( 1 ) subtle distortions in the cos wavelength scales ; and ( 2 ) `` doppler imaging '' effects , whereby active patches on the stellar surface might appear in the integrated spectrum as a redshift if , say , a bright region happened to be near the receding limb ( where the projected rotational velocity could be as much as @xmath12  km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "a secondary objective was to carry out a more extensive time - domain study of fuv variability , along the lines of the saar & bookbinder work , but with the added dimension of time - resolved spectroscopy possible with high - sensitivity , time - tagged cos .",
    "a related goal was to extend the previous minimal snap wavelength coverage ( g130m / detector side a : 1290 - 1430   ) , adding g160m / sides a and b , especially to reach the important 1550    doublet and @xmath81640 at the longer wavelengths ; and with stis to probe below the cos g130m / a shortwavelength cutoff ( side b was deactivated because ly@xmath5 @xmath81215 violated detector bright limits ) , including especially ly@xmath5 itself .",

    "the new _ hst _ program was carried out over two days in late - march 2012 ( the stellar rotation period is 2.8  d ) .",

    "the initial target acquisition was with the ccd in visible light through the f25nd3 filter .",
    "following that , a peak - up ( accurate target centering via a raster search ) was performed with the @xmath13 slit in dispersed visible light ( ccd with g430m-3936 grating setting ) . then , the stis fuv exposures were taken , through the @xmath14 photometric aperture for maximum throughput , although in principle retaining high accuracy in the wavelength scales thanks to the narrow - slit peak - up .    immediately following the stis segment , although in a separate visit , was the first of four one - orbit cos pointings , spaced evenly over roughly half a spin cycle so all sides of the possibly inhomogeneous surface activity would be visible .",
    "the four cos visits ostensibly were identical and occupied a single cvz orbit each .",
    "the cos visits began with an nuv imaging target acquisition , using mirror - a and the bright object aperture ( boa ) . following that , a 1000  s observation was taken with g160m-1577 ( 1387 - 1557    on detector side b ; 1578 - 1749    on side a ) , divided into equal length sub - exposures , one at each of the standard four `` fp - pos '' positions ( small grating rotations to suppress fixed - pattern noise ) .",
    "then , a 1780  s integration , also split into four equal fp - pos sub - exposures , was taken with g130m-1291 ( 1292 - 1432    on side a ; side b turned off , as in the earlier snap program , owing to overbright ly@xmath5 ) .",
    "all the cos observations were done in time - tag mode , which delivers a time - stamped record of photon @xmath15 positions in the 2-d detector format ( @xmath16 corresponds to wavelength ; @xmath17 to cross - dispersion spatial coordinate ) .",
    "these photon event lists can be processed in a number of ways to provide time histories of fluxes and/or line profiles .",
    "the particular g130 m and g160 m settings were chosen because they overlap at the important 1400    doublet , so that it would be recorded in all the observations .",
    "unfortunately , the key [ ] coronal forbidden line was captured only in the g130 m segments ; and the important subcoronal doublet only in the g160ms .",
    "the initial stis observation and first of the cos visits were intended to be carried out as a pair , as close together as practical , to serve as a velocity cross - validation .",
    "although cos exposures have an internal wavelength reference ( lamp flash ) , the calibration spectrum falls well above the stellar stripe , on a part of the detector where uncompensated geometrical distortions are different than where the stellar spectrum is located .",
    "further , the specific @xmath17-position of the stellar spectrum , and thus the local geometrical distortions it experiences , depends on the acquisition method .",
    "however , because the same strategy was used for all four cos visits , any wavelength issues identified in the comparison of the initial cos visit with stis should apply equally well to the three subsequent cos pointings . at the same time , while stis has exquisite velocity precision and can record s / n@xmath220 profiles of the brightest lines ( including ly@xmath5 , forbidden to cos ) , it lacks the sensitivity to resolve shapes of the bright lines on short time scales , or dig down to fainter features like the key ] 1400    density diagnostic ( see , e.g. , cook et al .",
    "1995 , and references therein ) .",
    "the stis spectra of ek  dra were processed and combined using protocols developed for the _ hst _ advanced spectral library project ( astralayres / astral/ ] ) , which includes a post - pipeline correction for subtle wavelength distortions .",
    "the four independent sub - exposures were co - added , but without the usual cross - correlation registration , because the relatively faint spectra lacked narrow features of suitable strength for the purpose .",
    "figure  2 compares representative intervals of the average stis fuv echelle spectrum of ek  dra to low - activity solar twin @xmath5  centauri a ( g2  v ) , also observed by stis with the same setup ( see ayres 2015 ) .    at first glance ,",
    "the two spectra are surprisingly alike , despite the enormous gulf between the stars in coronal activity ( the @xmath18 of ek  dra is about a thousand times that of @xmath5  cen ) .",
    "for example , the narrow chromospheric lines of , , and are quite similar in appearance between the hyperactive star and low - activity counterpart . even the hot lines like have similar emission cores .",
    "-5 mm     closer examination , however , reveals several differences .",
    "the most noticeable is the exceptionally broad ly@xmath5 profile of ek  dra ( although somewhat emphasized by the normalization approach : more distant ek  dra [ @xmath19  pc ] is more heavily absorbed by interstellar than close - by @xmath5  cen [ 1.3  pc ] , so is missing much of its intrinsic narrow peak ) . a second ,",
    "in fact blatant , difference is the bright [ ] coronal forbidden line of ek  dra , which is absent in low - activity @xmath5  cen ( the weak , narrow feature at 1354    is a chromospheric line ) . on the other hand , the striking difference at the @xmath81640 balmer-@xmath5 line mainly comes about because low - activity @xmath5  cen is dominated by a chromospheric blend on the blueward side of ; rather than high - excitation itself as in ek  dra .",
    "the prominent photospheric continuum of @xmath5  cen a in the @xmath81640 panel is an artifact of the scaling procedure : the line - to - continuum contrast is much smaller in the low - activity star compared with hyperactive ek  dra . if the normalization instead had been according to the bolometric fluxes , the 1640    photospheric continuum levels of the two stars would be similar , but the emission of ek  dra would dwarf that of @xmath5  cen a. ( indeed , a similar dwarfing would occur in all the panels with an @xmath20 normalization . ) more subtle , but significant , differences are the broad low - intensity wings of the ek  dra hot lines : , , , and ( @xmath21  k ) .",
    "there are some additional differences seen in the 1353.7    panel , having to do with pumping of the and lines by higher excitation species , leaving @xmath81355 much weaker by comparison in the active star .",

    "indeed , the stis fuv emission line intensities were stable over the 2.5  hours of near - continuous e140 m exposure .",
    "as luck would have it , however , less than an hour later at the beginning of the first cos g160 m sequence , ek  dra apparently was in outburst , experiencing a giant fuv flare .",

    "this phenomenon is discussed in more detail later (  3.4 ) .",
    "-15 mm     although the large fuv flare seemingly ruined the carefully orchestrated stis - cos velocity cross - calibration , the bright side is that this was the first such significant event on a sunlike star to have been captured with the un - matched spectroscopic and time - resolution capabilities of an instrument like cos ; a unique opportunity to explore properties of the outburst beyond the usual simple intensity evolution ( with modest temperature discrimination ) delivered by , say , an x - ray telescope . and , as described above , following the large flare ek dra settled into an period of apparent quiescence  to the extent that a star with a thousand times the x - ray luminosity of the sun can be considered `` quiet ''  for the next three cos visits ( spanning a day and a half , corresponding to about half a rotation period ) .",
    "the similarity of the time - averaged fuv spectra of these three visits , both among themselves and compared with the initial stis pointing , ultimately provided the desired velocity cross - validation ( as described later in  3.1 ) .",
    "so , all was not lost .",
    "furthermore , the lack of significant fuv profile variability of the hot lines between stis visit  1 and cos visits  3 - 5 , implies that `` doppler imaging '' was not an important factor during the 2012 _ hst _ campaign .",
    "in fact , the constancy of the hot - line fluxes over the more than half a rotational cycle also indicates that the surface distribution of fuv - emitting regions was relatively uniform , at least in that epoch . at higher energies , in contrast , gdel et al .",

    "albeit perhaps not the best guide to hyperactive ek  dra , the fuv - bright plage regions surrounding sunspot groups are much more spatially pervasive than the dark spots themselves , and more so than the compact coronal magnetic loop systems associated with the active region as well .",
    "ek  dra is reported to have a faint , m - type companion in a highly eccentric 45  year orbit ( knig et al .",
    "based on the authors ephemeris , the secondary would have been just past maximum elongation in 2012 , nearly due south of the primary with a separation of @xmath41 .",
    "this object would be at the inner edge of the cos psa , and potentially visible as a slightly displaced spectrum ( unfortunately on top of the main spectrum in the @xmath42 direction , given the position angle of the cos focal plane at the time of the 2012 program ) , but entirely outside the stis @xmath14 slot . however , there is no obvious line doubling due to a second spectrum visible in any of the cos fuv grating images ; although the predicted separation between the two is only + 0.35    ( ek  dra b to red of a ) , and the bright primary lines are broad .",
    "the secondary also was not clearly visible in ( stacked versions ) of either the stis or cos acquisition images of the 2012 campaign .",
    "serendipitously , however , the faint companion was recovered in a subsequent stis pointing on ek  dra , in an 2014 ism snap program ( s.  redfield p.i .",
    "; see table  1 ) .",
    "the partial orbit visit had a more conservative ccd acquisition : a total exposure time of 2.3  s through the f25nd3 aperture , significantly deeper than the 0.3  s of the 2012 program with the same filter .",
    "the secondary was about 1% of the primary s brightness , at a position angle of 172@xmath43 and separation of 0.75@xmath22 , just as predicted by the ephemeris of knig et al .",
    "the @xmath44 magnitude of the secondary would be about + 13.5 , taking into account that the broad - band ccd response favors red stars over yellow stars .",
    "the primary / secondary @xmath45 is what was suggested by knig et al .",
    "this is important , because a youthful red dwarf could be quite active , and its hot lines , if bright enough , potentially could affect the profiles of the primary features ( with the unfortunate location of b on top of the a spectrum in 2012 ) .",
    "however , scaling fuv fluxes of the most active dme flare stars , like au  microscopii and ad leonis , to the estimated @xmath44 magnitude of the secondary predicts peak flux densities , say at , of only a few percent of the primary s , which would be of little concern . a negligible impact by the red star , at least on the quiescent fuv spectrum of ek  dra , is supported by the fact that the cos visits  3 - 5 spectra are so similar to stis visit  1 , which entirely excluded the secondary by virtue of the small stis aperture .    as for the large fuv flare ,",
    "if it were from the red star , the associated soft x - ray luminosity ( see below ) would have been quasi - bolometric ( i.e. , @xmath46 ) ; not impossible , but very unlikely .",
    "the @xmath22 known examples , such as the quasi - bolometric flare on dg  cvn reported by drake et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , have come from the _ swift _ burst alert telescope , and soft - x - ray follow - up by that satellite .",
    "the survey burst alert situation is much more likely to capture extremely rare events because it is viewing a whole sky full of objects , all the time , rather than pointed at a single target for a limited period .",
    "furthermore , the enhanced narrow peaks of the fuv hot lines during the flare were nearly identical in shape and velocity to the quiescent profiles of the g star seen outside the outburst ; rather than shifted by the @xmath2 + 75 km s@xmath1 to the red expected if the fuv lines were instead from the secondary star .",
    "the preponderance of evidence is that the large fuv flare was from the g - type primary .",
    "a main objective of the 2012 ek  dra campaign was to test the reality of the large @xmath10  km s@xmath1 doppler shifts of recorded in the brief cos snapshot two years earlier .",
    "the core of that test was to validate the cos wavelengths against the highly precise scales of stis .",
    "in particular , the e140m-1425 echelle setting captures the entire fuv region ( 1150 - 1700   ) in a single shot , so there is no issue trying to tie together multiple spectral segments ( e.g. , g130 m and g160 m of cos , including the individual fp - pos steps , each with its own potential calibration issues ) .",
    "further , the stis mama cameras have hard - wired physical pixels , whereas the cross - delay - line detectors of cos have floating pixels defined by the @xmath15 impact point of the electron cloud associated with a photon event .",
    "the implication for stis is that a given pixel always experiences whatever geometrical distortions are present locally , and these can be accounted to some degree in the wavelength dispersion solution . with cos ,",
    "conversely , the geometrical distortions are sampled quasi - randomly by whatever distribution of impact points happen to fall at a particular location .",
    "perhaps more important , the stis wavelength calibration light ( from onboard hollow - cathode emission lamps ) follows the same optical path as an external stellar point source , falling on the same echelle order pixels as the stellar spectrum , and consequently experiences the same geometrical distortions .",
    "thus , the stis wavelength calibration spectra encode significant information concerning these local geometrical distortions , which then can be accommodated in a hybrid dispersion solution , such as described in the astral protocols mentioned earlier . for cos ,",
    "on the other hand , the lamp - flash spectrum falls well above the spectral stripe ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "3 ) , on a portion of the detector where the geometrical distortions are completely different . consequently ,",
    "the cos lamp - flashes are less relevant for confirming the pipeline dispersion solutions .",
    "to test the wavelength fidelity of cos , the three independent combinations of grating setting and detector segment were considered separately .",
    "reference spectra were taken from the calcos pipeline `` x1d '' files , which include a summation over the four fp - pos exposures , eliminating bad pixels and suppressing fixed pattern noise such as grid - wire shadows .",
    "the visits 3 - 5 spectra for each grating setting were registered to visit  3 by cross - correlation , and co - added to increase s / n . in all cases , extracted lamp - flash lines from the individual fp - pos exposures were very stable in velocity , demonstrating the repeatability of the calcos pipeline wavelength assignments ( although not necessarily their accuracy ) .",
    "figure  8 compares selected profiles of bright lines from the various cos grating / detector - segment combinations against the stis e140 m spectrum from visit  1 , convolved with the cos line - spread function .",
    "the zero point of the stis wavelength scale ( as in fig .",
    "2 ) was derived from the average velocity of @xmath81304 , @xmath81306 , and @xmath81351 , the brightest low - excitation narrow chromospheric lines recorded by stis .",
    "the ground - state @xmath81302 resonance line was avoided owing to a blue asymmetry imposed by redward interstellar atomic oxygen absorption ( see fig .",
    "note also that the stis @xmath81670 resonance line is truncated in its red wing by a gap between adjacent echelle orders .",
    "the derived chromospheric radial velocity was @xmath47  km s@xmath1 , compared with the photospheric value of @xmath48  km s@xmath1 expected in 2012 near orbital phase 0.5 ( knig et al .",
    "this indicates that part of the velocity correction , amounting to @xmath49  km s@xmath1 , could be a zero - point error in the stis wavelength scale for this observation , assuming that the fuv chromospheric velocity measured by stis , and the optical photospheric velocities measured by knig et al .",
    ", refer to the same frame , and further that the optical measurements are freer of systematics . aside from the possible zero - point correction ,",
    "the stis wavelength scales have high internal precision .",
    "-11 mm + 2.5 mm   -8 mm    the cos spectra are depicted in two ways : ( 1 ) with the original pipeline wavelengths , adjusted only for the assumed stellar radial velocity ( @xmath48  km s@xmath1 ) ; and ( 2 ) for a simple modification of the cos wavelength scales to force better global agreement with stis .",
    "the latter corrections , expressed as equivalent velocities , are of the form : @xmath50 the value @xmath51  km s@xmath1 was used for all the grating / segment combinations .",
    "the @xmath52 coefficients and reference wavelengths , @xmath53 , are as follows : @xmath540.112  km s@xmath1 @xmath1 and 1340    for g130m / a ; @xmath540.054  km s@xmath1 @xmath1 and 1400    for g160m / b ; and @xmath540.046  km s@xmath1 @xmath1 and 1640    for g160m / a . here",
    ", the negative @xmath52 coefficients are compensating for systematic redshifts of the assigned wavelengths that become progressively larger with wavelength .",
    "for example , the @xmath81393 feature recorded by g130m / a ( as in the earlier ayres & france cos snapshot ) , would have a total instrumental redshift of 10  km s@xmath1 , about half of the velocities ( @xmath10  km s@xmath1 ) measured in that study .",
    "however , a direct comparison between the two is subject to unknown systematic errors , not the least due to the different acquisition techniques , so the difference should not be taken too literally .",
    "the corrected cos spectra , in general , agree well with ground - truth stis , although there is at least one important exception ",
    "@xmath81393 at the extreme blue edge of g160m / b  where the linear velocity model appears to fall short .",
    "the cited grating - dependent velocity corrections were applied to the time - resolved cos profiles illustrated earlier in figs .  4 and 5 .",
    "nevertheless , the fundamental velocity measurements of the brightest lines , at least for the quiescent periods of ek  dra , were derived from the more precise stis spectra , as described below .      as mentioned earlier",
    ", there are interstellar absorptions present in several of the ground - state resonance lines of the stis fuv spectrum of ek  dra .",
    "these offer the opportunity to check the stis zero - point velocity deduced from narrow chromospheric emissions .",
    "the ism features are redshifted with respect to ek  dra , with an average heliocentric velocity of about @xmath542  km s@xmath1 . according to the maps of redfield & linsky ( 2008 ) ,",
    "ek  dra falls at the edge of the local interstellar cloud ( lic ) and also at the edge of the smaller north galactic pole ( ngp ) cloud . depending on the velocity vector assumed for the lic ( e.g. , gry & jenkins 2014 ) ,",
    "the predicted heliocentric velocity in the direction of ek  dra falls in the range @xmath54(1 - 3 )  km s@xmath1 ; while for the ngp cloud , the projected velocity is close to 0  km s@xmath1 : the galactic coordinates of ek  dra are nearly perpendicular to both directions of motion .",
    "it also is possible , and perhaps likely , that both clouds are contributing to the ism absorptions in the ek  dra spectrum .",
    "weighing in on the matter is a recent stis nuv high - resolution echelle ( e230h-2713 ) spectrum of ek  dra , taken in the 2014 ism snap program mentioned earlier : a 600  s exposure through the @xmath14 slot , without a peak - up ( see table  1 ) .",
    "the spectrum covers the important resonance lines at 2796    and 2803   , which have ism absorptions on the red sides of their broad chromospheric emission cores .",
    "the ism features fall at a velocity of @xmath55 km s@xmath1 heliocentric .",
    "however , cross - correlation against the same e230h-2713 bandpass from @xmath5  cen a suggests that there might be a @xmath56  km s@xmath1 systematic error in the ek  dra nuv photospheric spectrum , which would revise the ism velocity to about @xmath56  km s@xmath1 .",
    "the fuv and nuv interstellar features are illustrated in figure  9 .",
    "the agreement between the two independent sets of ism velocities provides additional confidence in the zero - point velocity calibration of the stis fuv spectra .",
    "tables  3 - 5 list representative measurements from stis visit  1 ( table  3 ) , the cos visits 3 - 5 averages for both g130 m and g160 m ( table  4 ) , and the cos visit  2 flare ( table  5 : g160 m only ) .",
    "the stis entries include important bright lines below the shortwavelength cutoff of cos g130m / a at 1290   , such as ly@xmath5 , @xmath81206 , and the resonance doublet at 1240   .",
    "stis also recorded detailed profiles of the 1305    triplet lines , which fall at the blue end of g130m / a but are corrupted by atomic oxygen skyglow in most of the cos pointings .",
    "the cos tables include weaker features that were not detectable in the stis spectrum , especially the key density - diagnostic multiplet of ] in the 1400    region .",
    "the same g160 m features in table  4 also were measured in the integrated g160 m flare spectrum of visit  2 , and reported in table  5 , to compare with the more quiescent intervals following the outburst .    for cos ,",
    "the measured doppler shifts are affected by residual errors in the simple correction of the g130 m and g160 m wavelength scales , so should be treated with caution .",
    "however , the absolute fluxes and derived line widths , say of narrow components ( nc ) and broad components ( bc ) in a bimodal fit , should be more reliable , since neither depends sensitively on accurate wavelengths .",
    "any systematic doppler shifts between nc and bc within a given spectral feature should be reliable as well , because the ( corrected ) cos wavelengths have sufficient precision over small wavelength separations .",

    "the scaled fluxes were combined on a common velocity grid , applying an olympic filter ( throwing out the highest and lowest of the six values ) for the central @xmath286  km s@xmath1 zone , and a more aggressive filtering ( eliminating the three highest values ) for the outer intervals where the influence of weak emission blends on the broad component is strongest . as with the individual bimodal",
    "fits , the hybrid profile has a relatively narrow nc , about 50  km s@xmath1 fwhm , and is redshifted by 5  km s@xmath1 , similar to those of low - activity g dwarfs like @xmath5  cen a ; but a very broad bc , about three times wider than the nc , and more redshifted ( 9  km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "the enhanced broadening and redshift of ek  dra s bc are the main distinguishing characteristics compared with low - activity counterparts like @xmath5  cen a ( e.g. , fig .  2 ) .",
    "uncertainties on the fitted parameters were estimated by a monte carlo approach : a reference profile ( the derived fit itself ) was perturbed by random realizations of the smoothed photometric error , and then refitted .",
    "the standard deviations of the derived parameters over many such trials were taken as a fair gauge of the measurement uncertainties devolving from the photometric noise component .",
    "recall the two bursts ( at @xmath403.6  hr and 3.7  hr ) in the g160 m blue and red continuum bands , which remarkably were not mirrored in any of the other activity tracers .",
    "these isolated bursts are distinctly bluer ( indicating a hotter continuum ) than the more equal count rates of the two separated continuum bands later on , in quiet visits 3 - 5 .",
    "this continuum - only behavior is challenging to understand , and seems to have few , if any , precedents among existing records of stellar flare events .",
    "this likely is because there are only a handful of stellar flare campaigns simultaneously at uv and soft x - ray energies .",
    "one example is mitra - kraev et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , who were able to use the optical monitor on _ xmm - newton , _ with broad - band fuv and nuv filters , to jointly record a number of uv / x - ray events on several dme stars .",
    "the authors found that the uv rise typically preceded the soft x - rays by several minutes , which usually is the case for white - light flares ( wlf ) on the sun .",
    "there is perhaps only a single example in their several time series where a uv burst was seen during a flare decay without an x - ray counterpart ( their fig .  1 ) .",
    "on the sun , wlfs are difficult to separate from the glare of the photosphere , but if one is seen , it usually will have an extensive supporting context , especially at high energies .",
    "fang & ding ( 1995 ) divided solar wlfs into two classes : type  i , or `` prompt , '' events which are coincident with the hard x - ray ( hxr ) burst , and apparently result from direct excitation of the chromospheric gas by the flare s energetic particle beams ; and the less frequent type  ii , or `` delayed , '' bursts , which occur several minutes after the hxr impulsive phase , and appear to be deeper seated , in the photosphere itself .",
    "fang & ding did not speculate on a source for the type  iis .",
    "perhaps the delayed fuv continuum brightenings on ek  dra are related to the solar wlf type  iis .",
    "one idea , motivated by the hot - line redshifts during the flare decay , is that the bursts are a response to the ballistic splash - down of the cooling gas onto the photospheric layers ; something analogous to accretion streams in t - tauri stars .",
    "ayres et al .",
    "( 2003 ) carried out a search for coronal forbidden lines in stis fuv spectra of the late - type objects with sufficiently deep exposures available at the time . in the hyper - active members of the sample ,",
    "like rs  canum venaticorum binaries and dme flare stars , the intrinsically faint [ ] @xmath81354 feature often was visible .",
    "furthermore , the [ ] line strength was found to be linearly correlated with the _ rosat _ soft x - ray flux . in the moderate - to - slow rotators ( in terms of @xmath287 ) , the average fwhm of the coronal iron line was about 110  km s@xmath1 , somewhat larger than the expected thermal width of @xmath288  km s@xmath1 at the formation temperature of 10  mk . in several of the fast rotators , there was a suggestion of @xmath289 enhanced broadening beyond that expected from @xmath287 alone .",
    "the `` super - rotational '' broadening was attributed to highly extended hot coronal structures .",
    "in ek  dra , the cos visits 3 - 5 average profile of [ ] does not display obviously extended red wings , like the lower temperature subcoronal features , although certainly the coronal forbidden line is very broad , approximately mid - way in width between the hot - line nc and bc . nevertheless , the fwhm@xmath290  km s@xmath1 is close enough to the low-@xmath287 average noted above that it would be difficult to make a case for super - rotational broadening .",
    "the cos velocity of [ ] in the visits 3 - 5 average spectrum is @xmath291  km s@xmath1 for the nist reference wavelength , although with the young et al .",
    "( 2015 ) revised value , the shift would decrease to about 0 ( @xmath292  km s@xmath1 from the @xmath293 of the reference wavelength ) . at the same time , the stis velocity of [ ] would shift to @xmath294  km s@xmath1 ( @xmath295  km s@xmath1 , where the larger @xmath296 partly is due to the reference wavelength , and partly to the low s / n of the measurement ) .    because [ ] correlates well with the _ rosat _ flux for hyper - active coronal sources , the measured intensity during the pre- and post - flare intervals can be exploited to estimate the quiescent x - ray flux of ek  dra during the 2012 campaign , noting that the existing _ rosat _ survey @xmath297 erg s@xmath1 ( 0.1 - 2.4  kev ) reported by gdel et al .",

    "( 2003 ) can be expressed as : @xmath298 the stellar bolometric flux , @xmath299 erg @xmath300 s@xmath1 , can be estimated from @xmath44 and a bolometric correction derived from @xmath301 ( see ayres et al .",
    "the bolometric luminosity , @xmath302 erg s@xmath1 , follows from the distance ( 34  pc ) , and is similar to @xmath303 .",
    "the [ ] flux ratio , based on the stis / cos average @xmath304 erg @xmath300 s@xmath1 , is @xmath305 : in the upper tier among the coronal objects considered by ayres et al .  ( 2003 ) .",
    "finally , the inferred x - ray luminosity is @xmath306 erg s@xmath1 , about twice the _ rosat _ survey value , but certainly consistent within the uncertainties of the [ ] scaling law , and the temporal variability of @xmath18 noted by gdel et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .",
    "figure  11 is a correlation diagram pitting various diagnostics against the doublet , which was recorded in every cos observation . as with the previous diagram(s ) , the individual flux values from all the visits were normalized to the corresponding averages over visits 3 - 5 .",
    "the upper distributions of symbols are contributed by the large flare , while the clump at ( 1,1 ) is dominated by the quiescent intervals , which nevertheless display low - level variability including a small flare decay .",
    "the straight lines are power - law fits to the individual distributions .",
    "the derived slopes range from 1.44 and 1.38 for [ ] and , respectively , to slightly above unity for ( 1.10 ) , and slightly below for chromospheric ( 0.89 ) .",
    "these slopes mirror similar power laws seen between , say , x - rays and in diverse samples of solar - type dwarfs ( e.g. , ayres et al .",
    "1995 ) , and in this instance must reflect the time - evolution of the post - flare cooling process .",
    "figure  12 compares doublet profiles from the cos g160 m exposures of the visit  2 flare decay , the visits 3 - 5 average cos g160 m spectrum , and a multi - epoch stis average for the quiet solar twin @xmath5  cen a ( ayres 2015 ) ; all including bimodal constrained gaussian fits .",
    "the quiescent profiles of ek  dra show redshifts of both components , less for the nc ( @xmath307  km s@xmath1 , for the average of the stis doublet members ) , more for the bc ( @xmath308  km s@xmath1 , for the stis doublet average ) .",
    "this compares with a somewhat smaller redshift of both @xmath5  cen a components ( @xmath309 km s@xmath1 for each ) .",
    "the width of the ek  dra nc in the quiet spectrum ( 50  km s@xmath1 ) is somewhat larger than in @xmath5  cen a ( 36  km s@xmath1 ) , but the bc is much broader ( 180  km s@xmath1 vs.  66  km s@xmath1 ) . in the flare ,",
    "remarkably , the nc has a similar redshift and fwhm ( @xmath291  km s@xmath1 and 45  km s@xmath1 , respectively ) to the `` quiet '' average , and indeed to the low - activity solar twin @xmath5  cen a. at the same time , the flare bc not only is broader than in the quiet cases ( @xmath310  km s@xmath1 ) , but is substantially more redshifted ( at about + 40  km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "the larger bc redshifts during the flare are notable but not unusual : similar behavior , with similar velocity shifts , has been seen previously in stis spectra of flares on the dme stars au  mic ( robinson et al .",

    "2003 ) , and appears to be a signature of the post - flare cooling process .",
    "what perhaps is more remarkable is that despite the very large difference in emission levels of the two solar analogs ( expressed , say , in terms of surface fluxes ) , the `` quiet '' profiles are as similar as they are , not only in the bimodal nature of the line shape asymmetries , but also in the magnitudes of the velocity shifts and line widths .    -5 mm     -5 mm     lcccc theoretical limits & 0.160.42 & 0.32.5 & 1.02 & 0.13 + electron density range ( @xmath4 ) & @xmath311 & @xmath311 & + quiet average : cos g130 m & @xmath312 & @xmath313 & @xmath314 & @xmath315 + quiet average : cos g160 m & @xmath316 & @xmath317 & @xmath318 & @xmath319 + flare : cos g160 m & @xmath320 & @xmath321 & @xmath322 & @xmath323 + quiet average : stis e140 m & @xmath324 & @xmath325 & @xmath326 & @xmath327 +      flower & nussbaumer ( 1975 ) originally proposed that flux ratios within the ] 1400    intercombination multiplet are sensitive to density over the range @xmath328 @xmath4 thought to be characteristic of solar conditions  quiescent at the low end , flaring on the high side  at the o@xmath329 ionization equilibrium peak temperature of @xmath330  k. there is a long history of applications to solar and stellar plasmas ( see , e.g. , cook et al .",

    "the logarithmic presentation emphasizes the wider , more redshifted broad components of the ek  dra profiles compared with low - activity @xmath5  cen .",
    "the 7-component gaussian fits ( five ] , two ] transitions ) take into account the small contamination of ] @xmath81404 by ] @xmath81404 , scaled from ] @xmath81406 ( one of the fitted features ) according to plasma emission models ( see ayres 2015 ) .",
    "table  6 summarizes ] diagnostic ratios constructed from the cos measurements in tables  4 and 5 , and including values from the multi - epoch average @xmath5  cen a stis spectrum .",
    "the nomenclature for the ratios is that of ayres ( 2015 ) : the numerators in the traditional density - sensitive @xmath331 and @xmath332 were replaced by @xmath333 to improve s / n with these generally faint emissions : @xmath334 and @xmath335 share a common upper level and their ratio is very close to unity according to theory .",
    "the hybrid numerator ratios are designated @xmath336 .",
    "the ratio @xmath337 also is composed of transitions that share a common upper level , with a theoretical value of 0.13 ( keenan et al .",
    "however , in this case there is no advantage to form a hybrid flux between @xmath338 and @xmath339 because the former transition usually is too low in s / n , if detected at all , in normal astrophysical sources .    the @xmath5  cen @xmath340 and @xmath337 ratios are close to the theoretical expectations .",
    "this also is the case for ek  dra , although the uncertainties are larger , especially for marginally detected @xmath338 .",
    "note , however , that the diagnostic ratios @xmath341 and @xmath342 are significantly elevated in ek  dra compared with @xmath5  cen .",
    "this is a clear indication of enhanced electron densities in the more active star .",
    "the @xmath5  cen ratios fall near the low - density limits of the respective @xmath343 s , indicating @xmath344 just below @xmath345  @xmath4 ; while the ek  dra ratios both are consistent with densities in the middle range , near or above @xmath346  @xmath4 , an order of magnitude larger .",
    "curiously , the inferred densities are not much different between the more quiet periods of the ek  dra cos campaign and the large fuv flare decay at the beginning ; especially for @xmath342 , which has the largest grasp of the two diagnostic ratios ( i.e. , largest variation in @xmath343 over the range of density sensitivity ) .",
    "the ] densities inferred here are about a factor of 2 higher than those estimated by gdel et al .",
    "( 1995 ) from emission - measure modeling of the _ rosat _ survey pulse - height spectra , at least for the softer ( 2  mk ) component of their 2-temperature fit ( this is the component that showed rotational modulations , as mentioned earlier ; whereas the harder , more dominant , @xmath347  mk one showed essentially no phase - correlated variability ) .",
    "nevertheless , the agreement must be tempered by the fact that the subcoronal gas is only one - tenth the temperature of even the cooler coronal plasma component , and likely is not co - located .",
    "the high densities during the flare decay in visit  2 suggest short cooling times ( @xmath348 ) , at least in the hot - line temperature range ( @xmath349  k ) where the radiative cooling curve peaks .",
    "this seemingly conflicts with the hours - long progression of the fuv decay .",
    "a similar dichotomy confronts interpretations of long - duration flares on the sun and other late - type stars .",
    "the usual explanation is that the long duration events are analogous to two - ribbon ( 2-r ) flares on the sun ( e.g. , gdel 2004 ) , which involve a sequential cascade of excitation through large arcade - like magnetic structures , rather than an impulsive burst in a single coronal loop .",
    "such 2-r events tend to be quite hot , exceeding 10  mk in peak temperature , with coronal electron densities up to about @xmath346  @xmath4 ( e.g. , gdel 2004 ) .",
    "importantly , the decay of the flare plasma in a 2-r event can be dominated by conductive energy exchange with the lower cooler layers , rather than direct radiative losses at the super - hot coronal temperatures ( see aschwanden et al .",
    "thus , the bright fuv emissions and subsonic plasma draining seen in the hot lines of ek  dra during the large fuv flare decay likely are a byproduct of these cooling processes playing out in the much more energetic setting of the hyper - active young solar analog .",
    "this brings to mind , as intimated by ayres & france , the dynamic `` coronal rain '' phenomenon associated with post - flare loops on the sun , as well as solar active regions in general ( see , e.g. , antolin & rouppe van der voort 2012 , and references therein ) .      because of the unique nature of the time - resolved fuv spectroscopy of the serendipitous ek  dra flare decay , it is important to place the event within the context of the nearly 100 large stellar flares captured in the soft x - ray band by historical and contemporary high - energy observatories ( as documented in the review by gdel 2004 ) .",
    "aschwanden et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have fitted various combinations of the derived emission measures ( em ) , x - ray luminosities ( @xmath18 ) at the flare temperature peak ( @xmath350 ) , and decay times ( @xmath351 ) with scaling relations approximated as power laws .",
    "inverting their eq .  12 for the dependence of decay time on flare peak temperature yields an estimate of the ( here unknown ) @xmath350 given the ( known ) @xmath351 : @xmath352 given the apparent , albeit fuv , flare decay time of about 7  ks , the peak x - ray temperature would be about 60  mk . using this value in eq .",
    "13 of aschwanden et al .",
    "yields @xmath353 erg s@xmath1 , which is an order of magnitude larger than the `` quiescent '' @xmath18 inferred from scaling the contemporaneous [ ] flux from the non - flare intervals . supporting that estimate",
    "is the fact that the peak enhancement of seen in cos visit  2 is about a factor of 10 , and the [ ] proxy for the high - temperature soft x - ray flux  although recorded later in visit  2 , not simultaneously with  parallels the trajectory during the flare decay , suggesting that [ ] would have been enhanced by a similar large factor , and so too the soft x - ray flux .    the inferred values of flare peak temperature , x - ray luminosity , decay time , and density ( again with the caveat that the latter is from the cooler fuv plasma ) place the ek  dra event in the upper - middle range of the documented stellar x - ray flares , as summarized by aschwanden et al . ; perhaps typical of a young active sunlike star , but more accessible in the case of ek  dra by its proximity : several times closer to earth than the members of the similar - age young clusters pleiades and alpha persei .",
    "the joint stis / cos study of ek  dra was adversely impacted by the unfortuitously - timed large fuv flare ( interrupting the intended instrumental cross - calibration ) , but nevertheless the event itself provided valuable insight into the post - flare cooling process , mainly thanks to the high spectral resolution achieved for a variety of key chromospheric and higher temperature features .",
    "the apparent quiescent periods following the flare also contributed significant insight , not only with regard to the velocity cross - calibration of the two uv spectrographs , but also in the lack of phase - correlated profile variations caused by rotational modulations .    to summarize : ( 1 ) the fuv redshifts appear to be a characteristic of the normal surface activity of the star , rather than an accident of doppler imaging ; ( 2 ) the hot - line profiles did not change qualitatively during the flare outburst ( ten - times enhancement of ) , except for the larger redshifts of the broad components ; and ( 3 ) ] -derived densities were not very different between the quiescent periods and the fuv flare , despite the fact that the high densities themselves are characteristic of large stellar soft x - ray events ( see , e.g. , benz & gdel 2010 ) .",
    "all of these properties suggest that the normal surface conditions on the star are not far removed from those in a big flare ; in other words , the stellar corona might be dominated by flaring structures , with a distribution weighted toward the smaller events , as on the sun , giving the appearance of quiescence at times , when exactly the opposite is true ( see gdel 2004 for a review of the `` flares all the way down '' coronal scenario ; what might be described as a _ `` flare - ona '' _ ) .",
    "one notable outcome of the time - resolved flare spectroscopy was the lack of strongly blueshifted emission , which naively might be anticipated from the catastrophic energy release , and indeed such outbursts on the sun are violently eruptive .",
    "however , as has been noted often in the flare literature , during the explosive heating of the lower atmosphere in an event , most of the outwardly expanding material undoubtedly is too hot to be visible in the fuv lines .",
    "only the subsequent decay phase would contribute strongly to the fuv features , as the super - hot coronal plasma in the flaring arcades conductively redistributes heat into the lower atmosphere , where it is radiated away partially at fuv temperatures and inspires the subsonic plasma draining phenomenon manifested in the hot - line redshifts .",
    "unfortunately , the initial impulsive phase of the ek  dra flare was not captured , and the key diagnostic of the hot - up / cool - down scenario  [ ]  was recorded only during the later phases of the event decay ( although note in fig .  4b the apparent small blueshifts of the coronal forbidden line compared with the average visits 3 - 5 behavior , which would be more exaggerated with the young et al",
    ".  reference wavelength ) .",
    "it also must be acknowledged that the peculiarities of the ek  dra flare decay should be viewed with some caution , because rarely has such an event been recorded in as much detail as provided by the cos part of the _ hst _ campaign : the oddities of the emission doppler shifts might well be associated with an unusual spatial orientation of the event , for example .    in the end , highly exaggerated stellar incidents like the ek  dra fuv flare dutifully cause us to look back to the sun in an effort to identify associations with solar high - energy transient phenomena , such as the coronal rain mentioned earlier .",
    "nevertheless , drawing such conclusions in general is tricky given the rather tepid activity levels displayed by our local star , even at its worst .",
    "probably a good thing for habitability of planet earth , but a continual challenge for the solar - stellar connection .",
