    "the quark model ( qm ) has been very successful in reproducing su(3 ) flavor octet ( @xmath5 ) and decuplet ( @xmath6 ) baryon masses , and to a somewhat lesser extent also higher mass baryon resonances , in terms of three - quark ( @xmath7 ) configurations .",
    "it is remarkable then that subsequent predictions of @xmath8 configurations of bound or quasibound dibaryons have not been found to be realized in nature , and that todate there is not even one single unambiguously established dibaryon .",
    "this statement is challenged by recent indications from @xmath9 reactions at celsius - wasa of a resonance structure at @xmath10 gev and @xmath11 mev that could be interpreted as a @xmath12 dibaryon bound by about 100 mev , but still about 200 mev above the @xmath13 threshold @xcite .",
    "we note that quark cluster calculations for @xmath14 @xmath8 configurations @xcite come up with only a weakly bound @xmath15 @xmath12 dibaryon which in terms of a @xmath16 configuration corresponds to a high - lying @xmath17 @xmath18 resonance .    in the strange sector ,",
    "jaffe s dibaryon @xmath19 with strangeness @xmath20 and quantum numbers @xmath21 which was predicted as a genuinely bound state well below the @xmath22 threshold , perhaps the most cited ever prediction made for any dibaryon @xcite , has not been confirmed experimentally in spite of several comprehensive searches @xcite .",
    "another equally ambitious early prediction was made by goldman _",
    "@xcite , also using a variant of the mit bag model , for @xmath23 dibaryons with @xmath24 values @xmath25 and @xmath26 , dominated by @xmath27 structure and lying below the @xmath28 threshold .",
    "more realistic quark cluster calculations by oka _",
    "@xcite , applying resonating group methods , did not confirm jaffe s deeply bound @xmath19 , placing it just below the @xmath29 threshold as a resonance about 26 mev above the @xmath22 threshold .",
    "the underlying binding mechanism common to all of these orbital angular momentum @xmath14 configurations is the color - magnetic gluon exchange interaction between quarks , a feature emphasized by oka @xcite who systematically studied @xmath14 dibaryon configurations that could benefit from short - range attraction . following earlier quark cluster calculations @xcite , these calculations resulted in no strange dibaryon bound states , and for the @xmath27-dominated @xmath23 bound - state configurations predicted in ref .",

    "however , a @xmath36 @xmath31 quasibound state is not necessarily required in order to reproduce the general shape of the @xmath35 spectrum , as shown by multichannel faddeev calculations @xcite .",
    "a cusp - like structure at the @xmath31 threshold region could arise from the particularly strong one pion exchange tensor interaction in the @xmath37 coupled - channel @xmath38 partial waves .",
    "several low - lying @xmath39 @xmath40 resonances were predicted in singlet and triplet configurations in a qm study by mulders _",

    "i introduce the notion of pion assisted dibaryons , @xmath45 .",
    "the idea is to enhance the binding of a @xmath14 @xmath46 configuration through the strong attraction provided by @xmath2-wave @xmath47 resonances . for the @xmath48 system",
    "this scenario requires quantum numbers @xmath49 to maximize the attraction from each one of the @xmath50 resonating @xmath51 subsystems , but then the @xmath16 subsystem must have @xmath52 which is pauli forbidden .",
    "hence this mechanism fails for @xmath53 , although @xmath49 is allowed for a @xmath48 configuration with @xmath54 and @xmath55 , and also for a @xmath56 configuration , particularly in @xmath14 .",
    "dibaryons of this sort that can not be composed of two nucleons were discussed long ago in the qm and termed ` extraneous dibaryons ' @xcite .",
    "the lowest ones predicted are @xmath57 at @xmath58 mev , with the @xmath59 subsequently assigned to a @xmath48 resonance suggested by observed anomalies in @xmath60 reactions on nuclei at @xmath61 mev ( @xmath62 mev ) @xcite .",
    "such a state can be realized for two nucleons in @xmath63 plus an @xmath64-wave pion .",
    "there has been no solid experimental support for this dibaryon candidate ever since .",
    "the limitations imposed by the pauli principle in the @xmath53 sector have no counterpart in the @xmath33 sector , where a @xmath65 stretched configuration @xmath3 is allowed .",
    "a possible quasibound state in this configuration has been recently studied @xcite by solving three - body faddeev equations with @xmath66 coupled channels chiral qm local interactions , and coupled @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) and @xmath51 separable @xmath2-wave interactions fitted to the position and decay parameters of the @xmath69 and @xmath70 resonances , respectively .",
    "the results exhibit strong sensitivity to the @xmath2-wave @xmath67 interaction , the least phenomenologically constrained interaction in this calculation , with a @xmath65 quasibound state persisting over a wide range of acceptable parametrizations .    finally , we briefly review the ongoing study , both theoretically and experimentally , of a more familiar example of meson assisted dibaryons : a @xmath0 quasibound state in the @xmath33 sector , driven by the @xmath71 which within @xmath72 coupled channels appears as a @xmath64-wave @xmath73 quasibound state ( qbs ) . for a recent overview of @xmath0 and its implications to @xmath1nuclear qbs phenomenology ,",

    "the input to all of the listed calculations is constrained by requiring that the @xmath71 @xmath79 resonance position , and as much as possible also its shape , are reproduced .",
    "the models that achieve it with one @xmath80 qbs pole , necessarily at or in the immediate vicinity of @xmath81 mev , produce @xmath0 binding in the range @xmath82 mev , considerably higher than the @xmath83 mev range in models with two @xmath80 qbs poles . among the listed calculations , only refs .",
    "@xcite used chiral @xmath80 models that produce two such poles , but in the first listed faddeev calculation of ref .  @xcite the energy dependence of the @xmath80 coupled channels input was suppressed in favor of fixed threshold values , thus making it effectively a single - pole calculation .",
    "qbs listed in the column before last , also produced a deeply lying and very broad @xmath0 qbs ( unlisted in the table ) in the range of @xmath84 mev and @xmath85 mev . ]",
    "the shallow qbs of the last two columns are primarily related to the pole position of the chiral @xmath86 amplitude which resonates at 1420 mev ( close to the upper of the two @xmath80 poles ) in chiral models , whereas in single - pole models the @xmath86 amplitude resonates necessarily at 1405 mev .",
    "this correlation with the resonance behavior of the @xmath86 amplitude has been verified in the variational calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite and in the coupled - channel faddeev study of ref .",
    "a notable feature of the @xmath0 single - pole coupled - channel calculations @xcite in table  [ tab : k^-pp ] is that the explicit use of the @xmath87 channel adds about @xmath88  mev to the @xmath0 binding energy with respect to that calculated using effective @xmath86 potential within a @xmath89 single - channel calculation @xcite .    a reanalyzed disto spectrum of @xmath76 from ref .",
    "@xcite is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : disto ] . the authors claim that the peak structure of the outgoing @xmath35 gives evidence for a @xmath0 quasibound state decaying via @xmath90 .",
    "the location of the peak practically on top of the @xmath87 threshold , and its large width , are at odds with any of the few - body calculations listed in table  [ tab : k^-pp ] , posing a problem for a @xmath0 qbs interpretation . at present , besides ongoing @xmath91 measurements at gsi to improve on the disto data , the @xmath0 system will be explored at j - parc in the @xmath92 and @xmath93 reactions .",
    "in this festschrift contribution i have reviewed the state of the art in dibaryons with strangeness , including @xmath0 for which extensive experimental searches are underway . a new class of strange dibaryons which are termed meson assisted strange dibaryons",
    "was highlighted .",
    "@xmath0 is just one example , where the strong @xmath64-wave @xmath73 interactions stabilize the initially unstable @xmath94 dibaryon .",
    "pion assisted dibaryons @xmath95 offer more possibilities by making use of the strong @xmath2-wave @xmath47 and @xmath96 resonances classified in the su(3 ) @xmath97 representation and its extensions into charm @xmath98 .",
    "possible candidates are as follows @xcite .    * @xmath99 : @xmath100 * @xmath101 : @xmath102 @xmath103 @xmath104 * @xmath105 : @xmath106    note the appearance of the @xmath107 @xmath108 baryon , of quark structure @xmath109 . in the case of charmed baryons ,",
    "the @xmath2-wave non - charmed su(3)-@xmath97 @xmath110 resonances are replaced by charmed su(3)-@xmath111 members of the su(4)-@xmath112 extension : @xmath113 here we limited listing to @xmath101 baryons . for a future",
    "charmed bound - state study , note that the @xmath114 threshold lies _ below _",
    "@xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the lowest lying known @xmath117 , with assumed @xmath118 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath114 is bound , it will decay only by weak interactions .",
    "realistic calculations of pion assisted dibaryons have been reported so far only for the @xmath65 system with @xmath3 , where its coupling to the higher channel @xmath87 was considered while the coupling to the lower nonpionic channel @xmath31 was ignored @xcite .",
    "this system is a good candidate for a quasibound dibaryon either below or above the @xmath65 threshold , but its precise location depends sensitively on the poorly known @xmath119 form factor .",
    "we note that the @xmath65 threshold is about 130 mev below the @xmath120 threshold and 230 mev below the @xmath121 threshold , these latter thresholds being relevant in the discussion of the leading @xmath8 @xmath33 dibaryon configuration of table  [ tab : oka ] . in this respect a @xmath65 dibaryon , if established , is the next one in excitation energy to the lowest @xmath33 thresholds of @xmath40 and @xmath31 .",
