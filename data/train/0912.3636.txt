    "superconductivity occurs in the cuprates when a sufficient density of carriers is introduced into the cu - o planes of the parent compound which is essentially an antiferromagnetic insulator .",
    "this feature has stimulated much work directed towards understanding the link between magnetism and superconductivity in these compounds .",
    "two particular centres of interest concern a ) , the possible role of spin fluctuations in mediating superconductivity and b ) , the antiferromagnetism - superconductivity phase diagram as a function of carrier density .",
    "this latter aspect also embraces the question whether or not antiferromagnetic order and superconductivity are always mutually exclusive on an atomic level .    in yba@xmath0cu@xmath3o@xmath4 ,",
    "the cu occupy cu(1 ) ( chain ) and cu(2 ) ( plane ) sites .",
    "the phase diagram of extends from @xmath11 6 , where the compound is a mott insulator and the cu(2 ) of the planes order antiferromagnetically to @xmath11 7 , where it is an optimally doped superconductor ( t@xmath12 90k ) and the cu(2 ) do not carry magnetic moments .",
    "the introduction of a low level of doping into the insulator leads to the breakdown of the long range order and the introduction of dynamical features .",
    "some cu(2 ) based magnetic order persists in samples with intermediate doping levels which show superconductivity @xcite .",
    "moments linked with orbital currents have also been evidenced @xcite but not confirmed @xcite . in the intermediate doping region ,",
    "early theoretical studies based on the hubbard and t - j models , envisaged segregation into charge poor ( antiferromagnetic cu(2 ) ) and charge rich ( superconducting ) regions @xcite , in which case the observed cu(2 ) magnetic order would involve only part of the sample .",
    "although local probe measurements on underdoped polycrystalline samples evidence segregation into magnetic and non - magnetic regions @xcite , it is problematic , in such samples , to experimentally determine whether or not superconductivity and cu(2 ) magnetic order are mutually exclusive at an atomic level .",
    "the question may thus be asked , are there cases in the cuprates where the carrier density is high enough for well developed superconductivity to exist but where the cu(2 ) remain magnetically ordered ?",
    "this is clearly not an omnipresent possibility as shown by the discussions concerning the existence of a quantum critical point @xcite , but it is still of interest to examine whether cu(2 ) magnetic order and superconductivity can coexist at an atomic level in specific cases .",
    "here we show that in absence of any applied magnetic field , all the cu(2 ) in fully oxidized , superconducting yba@xmath0(cu@xmath1ni@xmath2)@xmath3o@xmath4 ( y @xmath57 ) carry correlated magnetic moments .",
    "the correlations are probably short - range .",
    "nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) results on equivalent samples have previously shown that field induced staggered cu(2 ) magnetic moments are nucleated around the substituted ni both above @xcite and below @xcite t@xmath13 .",
    "for the mssbauer measurements , a single phase polycrystalline sample of y@xmath14yb@xmath15ba@xmath0(cu@xmath1ni@xmath2)@xmath3o@xmath4 ( @xmath167 ) was prepared through conventional cycles of sintering and crushing , followed by oxygen anneals .",
    "the yb was enriched in the mssbauer isotope @xmath7yb .",
    "we recall that the yb@xmath17 ion is a non - perturbing probe in that it has no influence on the superconductivity ( neither on t@xmath13 nor on the meissner fraction ) and it has no influence on any cu(2 ) based magnetic order .",
    "the total signal provided by a mssbauer measurement contains contributions coming from each and every individual @xmath7yb probe in the sample .",
    "the measurements thus provide information which concerns the total sample volume .",
    "an equivalent single phase sample which did not contain any yb was prepared in the same way for the @xmath8sr measurements .",
    "dc susceptibility measurements , made down to 4.2k , provided the t@xmath6 values of @xmath575k ( with or without yb ) which is a typical value for a ni concentration of @xmath18 .",
    "these measurements also showed that as the temperature is reduced , the ( negative ) meissner susceptibility is essentially independent of temperature below @xmath550k .",
    "the mssbauer measurements on the paramagnetic @xmath7yb@xmath17 probes were carried out in absence of any applied field .",
    "we recall the main aspects @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7yb@xmath17 probes , which substitute at the y@xmath17 site within the cu(2 ) - o bilayers , are randomly distributed throughout the sample volume .",
    "the average in - plane distance between two probes is @xmath55 a or b lattice parameters .",
    "the majority of the @xmath7yb@xmath17 thus behave as isolated probes in that they have no interaction with any other of the yb@xmath17 . in principle",
    ", there will be a spin - spin interaction linking the small fraction of the yb@xmath17 which have a ni as a near neighbour but experimentally this interaction plays a negligible role .",
    "the only interaction that is clearly detected by the @xmath7yb@xmath17 is the molecular field which acts on its spin .",
    "this field is present when the nearest neighbour cu(2 ) to a yb@xmath17 carry correlated magnetic moments .",
    "these magnetically correlated cu(2 ) are initially nucleated around each ni .",
    "if we observe that all ( or a fraction ) of the probes experience a molecular field , this shows the cu(2 ) in all ( or in a fraction ) of the sample carry magnetic moments that are correlated .",
    "this local probe technique provides no information concerning the size of the cu(2 ) moments nor their magnetic correlation length .",
    "however , it provides information concerning the fluctuation rate of the molecular field ( the fluctuation rate of the correlated cu(2 ) magnetic moments ) provided this falls within the @xmath7yb mssbauer frequency window for which the lower bound is @xmath510@xmath19s@xmath20 .",
    "an introduction to the positive muon spin rotation / relaxation ( @xmath8sr ) techniques is given in refs . .",
    "the measurements were carried out at the musr spectrometer of the isis facility , rutherford - appleton laboratory , chilton , uk .",
    "both the substituted @xmath7yb@xmath17 probes and the implanted muon probes furnish information concerning the local magnetic properties of the matrix by detecting the internal fields that are produced on them . for the @xmath7yb@xmath17 probe , it is a molecular field that is detected , whereas for the muon probe , it is the longer range dipolar field .",
    "the two techniques thus examine the local magnetic properties over somewhat different length scales .",
    "both techniques can also provide information concerning the fluctuation rates of the field .",
    "the @xmath7yb mssbauer measurements ( i@xmath21 = 0 , i@xmath22 = 2 , e@xmath23 = 84kev , 1mm / s = 68mhz ) were made using a source of tm@xmath24b@xmath25 and a linear velocity sweep .",
    "the analysis of the experimental lineshapes to be presented below , is made in terms of the electro - nuclear ( breit - rabi ) hamiltonian comprising a hyperfine interaction and an electronic zeeman term : @xmath26 * a * and * g * are the known hyperfine and g - tensors associated with the yb@xmath17 ground state kramers doublet @xcite , @xmath27 is the bohr magneton and h(t ) the fluctuating molecular field acting on the yb@xmath17 which has an effective spin @xmath28=1/2 .",
    "the energy equivalent of each of the two terms is of order 0.1k .",
    "we first show on fig.[figybmosssim ] simulated lineshapes corresponding to eq .",
    "[ eqn1 ] for different fluctuation rates of the molecular field .",
    "the three different lineshapes correspond to the three types of ( sub)spectra that are encountered experimentally .",
    "the field intensity is fixed at the value @xmath29 .",
    "the top lineshape ( multicomponent lineshape ) was calculated from eq .",
    "[ eqn1 ] with the field `` static '' on the @xmath7yb mssbauer frequency scale , @xmath30 if the field fluctuates , it does so at a rate which is below the lower limit of the mssbauer frequency window ( @xmath510@xmath31s@xmath20 ) .",
    "the middle lineshape ( single component lineshape ) was obtained with the field fluctuating within the frequency window at a rate 5.@xmath3210@xmath33s@xmath20 and the bottom lineshape ( doublet lineshape ) was calculated with the field fluctuating above the frequency window ( fluctuating too fast to be detected ) .",
    "this lineshape also corresponds to the case when the field is simply absent .",
    "experimentally , the assessment as to whether , at a particular temperature , the field has no influence on the lineshape because it fluctuates too fast or because it is absent , has to be made by examining the thermal dependence of the field in the temperature range where it is visible .",
    "experimental data were obtained over the range 0.1 to 70k and data for three selected temperatures are shown on fig.[figybmossdata ] .",
    "we first note that although only one type of sub - spectrum ( the multicomponent lineshape but with two slightly different forms ) is present at 0.1k , at higher temperatures quite different subspectra are simultaneously present .",
    "for example , on fig.[figybmossdata ] at 2.5k , the three subspectra corresponding to the three examples on fig.[figybmosssim ] are all present with different relative weights .",
    "our local probe technique thus shows that at specific temperatures , it is possible to identify the coexistence of quite different local behaviours .",

    "see the text for details .",
    "these calculated spectra correspond to the forms of the ( sub)spectra evidenced experimentally in fig.[figybmossdata].,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    at 0.1k , only the multicomponent lineshape shown at the top of fig.[figybmosssim ] is present .",
    "this indicates that each of the yb@xmath17 spins throughout the sample experiences a molecular field which is static on the time scale 10@xmath38s .",
    "the presence of this field on all of the probes indicates that essentially all the cu(2 ) of the sample carry magnetic moments which are at least short range correlated and which appear static .",
    "the best data fit is obtained with a molecular field that shows a distribution in size .",
    "the effect of the distribution is well mimicked by fitting in terms of two fields ( 0.22 t on 62% of the probes and 0.07",
    "t on 38% ) ( fig .",
    "[ figybmossdata ] top ) .",
    "the weighted mean provides the average field ( 0.16 t ) and the difference between the two fields ( 0.15 t ) provides an estimate of the range of the distribution .",
    "our observation of a distribution in the size of the molecular field suggests there is a distribution in the size of the correlated cu(2 ) magnetic moments .",
    "@xmath39o nmr measurements on analogous ni substituted samples ( sec .",
    "[ discussion ] ) have evidenced that the size of the staggered cu(2 ) magnetic moments observed in an applied magnetic field depend on the distance between a cu(2 ) and a ni .",
    "our results evidence that correlated cu(2 ) moments exist in absence of an applied field and they show an intrinsic distribution in size .",
    "the average size of the molecular field obtained here is similar to that observed on yb@xmath17 in superconducting yba@xmath0(cu@xmath1co@xmath2)@xmath3o@xmath36 @xcite , where the cu(2 ) moments which give rise to the field have an average value of a fraction of a @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "we thus suggest the average size of the correlated cu(2 ) moments in the present ni substituted samples is of the order of a fraction of a @xmath40 .",
    "we have no direct information concerning the directional properties of the correlated cu(2 ) magnetic moments .",
    "however , since we find the average size and the average direction of the molecular field observed here are similar to those observed on the @xmath7yb probe in other cuprates where the cu(2 ) moments lie in the ( ab ) plane @xcite , it is possible that here also , the cu(2 ) magnetic moments also lie towards the ( ab ) plane .",
    "yb mssbauer absorption spectra for y@xmath14yb@xmath15ba@xmath0(cu@xmath1ni@xmath2)@xmath3o@xmath4 ( @xmath16 7 ) .",
    "different subspectra are present and the line fits are explained in the text.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the variation of the line shapes as a function of increasing temperature follows roughly the same evolution observed in yba@xmath0(cu@xmath1co@xmath2)@xmath3o@xmath4 ( y @xmath57 ) @xcite but the changes take place at much lower temperatures in the sample substituted with ni than in the sample substituted with co. in yba@xmath0(cu@xmath1ni@xmath2)@xmath3o@xmath36 there is a relatively rapid change up to @xmath53.0k    : at 2.5k ( fig.[figybmossdata ] ) , a `` static '' molecular field ( multicomponent subspectrum ) is now present on only @xmath530% of the yb@xmath17 ions and no field ( doublet subspectrum ) is visible on @xmath512% of the yb@xmath17 with the remainder corresponding to the singlet component lineshape . above @xmath53.0k , the subspectrum corresponding to a `` static '' field is no longer visible and there is a progressive change in the relative weights of the two remaining subspectra .",
    "fig.[figybmossdata ] shows that at 60k , the relative weight of the subspectrum corresponding to no visible field ( doublet subspectrum ) has increased to @xmath550% .",
    "the analysis of the lineshapes at the different temperatures evidences a ) at each particular temperature there is a wide distribution in the local fluctuation rates and b ) the average fluctuation rate increases as the temperature is increased . because of the wide distribution in the rates , it is difficult to obtain accurate values for the average rates .",
    "we simply estimate that on increasing the temperature to 60k , this average rate increases progressively by two to three orders of magnitude above the threshold value of 10@xmath19s@xmath20 .    if the evolution in yba@xmath0(cu@xmath1ni@xmath2)@xmath3o@xmath36 is considered as a function of decreasing temperature , the fluctuation rates decrease progressively .",
    "it thus seems likely that the correlated moments continue to fluctuate at 0.1k and below , but with rates that are below 10@xmath19s@xmath20 and thus too low to be experimentally accessible using @xmath7yb .",

    "we found they are well accounted for either by taking the product with a stretched exponential @xmath55 $ ] or by using a two component model : @xmath56 where the electron based magnetism influences the asymmetry in part of the sample ( of relative volume @xmath57 ) and does not influence the asymmetry in the remaining part ( of relative volume @xmath58 ) .",
    "this component model is physically equivalent to the component model used to interpret the @xmath7yb data ( section [ mossbauer ] ) .    with the stretched exponential model , we find that @xmath59 remains below 1.0 and @xmath60 increases with decreasing temperature .",

    "we anticipate that @xmath8sr measurements at low enough temperatures below 1.5k when analysed with the two component model will show that the asymmetries of all the muons are influenced by interactions with electron based magnetic moments .",

    "in addition , it seems likely that the approximate @xmath62 volume fraction of the sample where the molecular field is `` static '' on the @xmath7yb time - scale at @xmath63 , corresponds to the volume fraction ( @xmath64 at @xmath65 , @xmath66 at @xmath67 ) where @xmath8sr evidences electron - based magnetic moments .",
    "the observation that at temperatures just above 5k , the fluctuations are too fast to be detected by @xmath8sr , whereas they are detected by @xmath7yb indicates that the frequency window accessible for @xmath8sr is lower than that for @xmath7yb .    to further examine the cu(2 ) correlations , at @xmath42 we have measured the influence of applied longitudinal magnetic fields of 10 and 200mt ( fig .",
    "[ fignimuon ] ) . in these fields ,",
    "the nuclear moments no longer influence the asymmetry .",
    "the strong dependence on applied field points to the `` quasi - static '' nature of the electron - based magnetic moments .",
    "the fact that a field as small as @xmath68 has a strong influence on the asymmetry means that some of the correlations are characterised by a fluctuation rate smaller than @xmath69 ( the muon gyromagnetic ratio @xmath70 = 851.615 mrad s@xmath20 t@xmath20 ) .",
    "these particular fluctuations are too slow to influence the @xmath7yb lineshapes and they can be linked to the `` static '' subspectrum of figs.[figybmosssim ] and [ figybmossdata ] .",
    "in fact , the form of the asymmetry with @xmath68 is relatively complex . at short times",
    "it is suggestive of an overdamped oscillation which would be indicative of correlations over lengths of a few lattice spacings @xcite . however , because we know from the @xmath7yb and the @xmath8sr measurements carried out in zero applied field that distributions exist in both the size and fluctuation rates of the correlated cu(2 ) magnetic moments , it is not possible to carry out a productive quantitative analysis .",
    "this is also the case for the results obtained with @xmath71 , where the asymmetry has an exponential form with @xmath72 and where the whole asymmetry is accounted for .",
    "@xmath8sr measurements have shown that when ni is substituted into the different superconducting system la@xmath73sr@xmath74cuo@xmath75 , the dynamics of the cu spin correlations which develop depend both on temperature ( the fluctuation rates of the correlated cu decrease with decreasing temperature ) and on ni content @xcite .",

    "<S> the @xmath7yb measurements show the cu(2 ) over essentially all the sample volume carry magnetically correlated moments which are static on the time - scale @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the moments show a distribution in size . </S>",
    "<S> the correlations are probably short range . as the temperature increases , </S>",
    "<S> the correlated moments are observed to fluctuate with measurable rates ( in the ghz range ) which increase as the temperature increases and which show a wide distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath8sr measurements also evidence that the fluctuation rates increase with increasing temperature and there is a distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the evidenced fluctuating , correlated cu(2 ) moments coexist at an atomic level with superconductivity . </S>"
