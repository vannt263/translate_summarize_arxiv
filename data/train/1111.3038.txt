    "the major feature of dynamical processes in many complex relaxing systems is their stochastic background @xcite . particularly , in any dielectric ( complex ) system under an week external electric field ( external action ) only a part ( active dipoles or objects ) of the total number of dipoles is directly governed by changes of the field .",
    "but even those dipoles , not contributing to the relaxation dynamics , can have an effect on the behavior of active dipoles @xcite .",
    "if the dipoles interact with each other , then their evolution has a random character .",
    "consequently , the behavior of such a relaxing system as a whole will not be exponential in nature . in this case",
    "the macroscopic behavior of the complex systems is governed by `` averaging principles '' like the law of large numbers following from the theory of probability @xcite .",
    "the macroscopic dynamics of complex systems is not attributed to any particular object taken from those forming the systems .",
    "the finding out an `` averaged '' object representity for the entire relaxing system is not simple .",
    "the relation between the local random characteristics of complex systems and the universal deterministic empirical laws requires a probabilistic justification .",
    "there are some points of view on this problem .",
    "one of well - known them is based on randomizing the parameters of distributions that describes the relaxation rates in disordered systems . with regard to the dielectric relaxation , each individual dipole in a complex system relaxes exponentially , but their relaxation rates are different and obey a probability distribution ( continuous function ) @xcite .",
    "this approach is successive for getting many empirical response laws and their classification , but it sometime becomes enough complicated to interpret their interrelations and to derive macroscopic response equations ..    in this paper we suggest an alternative approach to the analysis of non - exponential relaxation .",
    "it is based on subordination of random processes .",
    "recall that in the theory of anomalous diffusion the notation of subordination occupies one of the most important places ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "so , a subordinated process @xmath2 is obtained by randomizing the time clock of a random ( parent ) process @xmath3 by means of a random process @xmath4 called the directing process .",
    "the latter process is also often referred to as the randomized time or operational time @xcite . in the common case",
    "the process @xmath5 may be both random and deterministic in nature .",
    "the subordination of random processes is a starting point for the anomalous diffusion theory .",
    "we develop this approach to relaxation processes .",
    "it gives an efficient method for calculating the dynamical evaluating averages of the relaxation processes . in this connection section  [ par2 ]",
    "is devoted a presentation of recent achievements of this method .",
    "starting with the description of the two - state system evolution as a markovian process , we develop the analysis on subordinated random processes .",
    "the processes differ from the markovian ones by the temporal variable becoming random . in this context",
    "the cole - cole relaxation is an evident example . in section  [ par3 ]",
    "we consider the tempered @xmath0-stable processes .",
    "they overcome the infinite - moment difficulty of the usual ( not tempered ) @xmath0-stable processes .",
    "as applied to the anomalous diffusion , the tempering gives a preserving the subdiffusive behavior for short times whereas for long times the diffusion is something like normal . using the processes in section  [ par4 ] , we develop a subordination scheme for the description of the tempered relaxation .",
    "section  [ par5 ] formulates major properties of such relaxation .",
    "we show that it has a direct relation to the well - known experimental laws of relaxation , in particular , to the cole - davidson law .",
    "finally , the conclusions are drawn in section  [ par6 ] .",
    "the simplest ordinary interpretation of relaxation phenomena is based on the concept of a system of independent exponentially relaxing objects ( for example , dipoles ) with different ( independent ) relaxation rates @xcite .",
    "the relaxation process , following this law ( called debye s ) , may be represented by behavior of a two - state system .",
    "let @xmath6 be the common number of dipoles in a dielectric system . if @xmath7 is the number of dipoles in the state @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the number of dipoles in the state @xmath10 so that @xmath11 .",
    "assume that for @xmath12 the system is stated in order so that the states @xmath8 dominate , namely @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the part of dipoles in the state @xmath8 , @xmath15 the part in the state @xmath10 .",
    "denote the transition rate by @xmath16 defined from microscopic properties of the system ( for instance , according to the given hamiltonian of interaction and the fermi s golden rule ) . in the simplest case ( d relaxation )",
    "the kinetic equation takes the form @xmath17 where , as usual , the dotted symbol means the first - order derivative .",
    "the relaxation function for the two - state system is @xmath18 it is easy see that the steady state of the system corresponds to equilibrium with @xmath19 .",
    "clearly , its response has also an exponential character .",
    "however , this happens to be the case of dipoles relaxing irrespective of each other and of their environment .",
    "if the dipoles interact with their environment , and the interaction is complex ( or random ) , their contribution in relaxation already will not result in any exponential delay .",
    "assume that the interaction of dipoles with environment is taken into account with the aid of the temporal subordination .",
    "we will consider the evolution of the number of dipoles in the states @xmath10 and @xmath8 .",
    "this are parent random processes in the sense of subordination .",
    "they may be subordinated by another random process with a probability density , say @xmath20 .",
    "if @xmath21 and @xmath22 , taking from eq.([eqa1 ] ) as probability laws of the parent processes , depend now on a local time @xmath23 , then the resulting @xmath24 and @xmath25 after the subordination is determined by the integral relation @xmath26 if the directing process ( a new time clock or stochastic time arrow @xcite ) is an inverse @xmath0-stable process , its probability density has the following laplace image @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the bromwich path .",
    "this probability density has a simple physical interpretation .",
    "it determines the probability to be at the internal time ( or so - called operational time ) @xmath23 on the real ( physical ) time @xmath29 .",
    "the function @xmath30 can be expanded as a taylor series . besides , it has the fox h - function representation @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the ordinary gamma function . in the theory of anomalous diffusion the random process @xmath33",
    "is applied for the subordination of l@xmath34vy ( or gaussian ) random processes @xcite .",
    "the inverse @xmath0-stable process accounts for the amount of time that a walker does not participate in the motion process @xcite .",
    "if the walker participated all time in the motion process , the internal time and the physical ( external ) time would coincide .    as was shown in @xcite ,",
    "the stochastic time arrow can be applied to the general kinetic equation .",
    "then the equation describing a two - state system takes the following form @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the @xmath0-order fractional derivative with respect to time .",
    "here we use the caputo derivative @xcite , namely @xmath37 where @xmath38 means the @xmath39-derivative of @xmath40 .",
    "the relaxation function for the two - state system is written as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the one - parameter mittag - leffler function @xcite .",
    "it is important to notice that the relaxation function corresponds to the cole - cole ( cc ) law . with reference to the theory of subordination",
    "the cc law shows that the dipoles tend to equilibrium via motion alternating with stops so that the temporal intervals between them is random .",
    "the random values are governed by an inverse @xmath0-stable subordinator .",
    "the evolution of @xmath24 and @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ eqb1 ] ) can be connected with the mittag - leffler distribution . if @xmath43 denotes the sum of @xmath39 independent random values with the mittag - leffler distribution , then the laplace transform of @xmath44 is @xmath45 , which tends to @xmath46 as @xmath39 tends to infinity . following the arguments of pillai @xcite",
    ", this supports an infinity divisibility of the mittag - leffler distribution . due to the power asymptotic form ( long tail ) the distribution with parameter @xmath0",
    "is attracted to the stable distribution with exponent @xmath0 , @xmath47 .",
    "the property of the mittag - leffler distribution permits one to determine a stochastic process .",
    "the process ( called mittag - leffler s ) arises of subordinating a stable process by a directing ( generalized ) gamma process @xcite . in this case",
    "the relaxation function has the form @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 are constant .",
    "the one - side fourier transformation of the relaxation function gives the havriliak - negami ( hn ) law @xmath52 this result also corresponds to the well - know hn empirical law .",
    "thus , the hn relaxation can be explained from the subordination approach , if the hitting time process of dipole orientations transforms into the mittag - leffler process @xcite .",
    "for that the hitting time process has an appropriate distribution attracted to the stable distribution . the subordination of the latter results just in the mittag - leffler process .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the lvy process subordinated by another lvy one leads again to the lvy process , but with other index @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the description from the mittag - leffler process gives nothing for the derivation of any macroscopic response equation like eq.([eqc1 ] ) .",
    "the relaxation model based on the inverse @xmath0-stable process starts with the consideration of @xmath0-stable processes having the infinite - moment difficult . to overcome it",
    ", one can develop an approach stated on tempered @xmath0-stable processes .",
    "the tempered @xmath0-stable process @xcite has the laplace image of its distribution in the form @xmath53 when @xmath54 equals to zero , the tempered @xmath0-stable process becomes simply @xmath0-stable .",
    "however , the distribution ( [ eq5 ] ) describes only probabilistic properties in terms of internal time . for subordination",
    "we need the probability distribution of the inverse tempered @xmath0-stable process . if @xmath55 is the p.d.f . of internal time , then the p.d.f . of its inverse @xmath56",

    "( [ eq6 ] ) tends to @xmath60 this expression corresponds to the laplace image of an inverse @xmath0-stable p.d.f . describing a directing process in the theory of cole - cole relaxation .",
    "after the inverse laplace transform we have eq.([eqb1 ] ) .    in the laplace space the function @xmath61 has a simple form . because of general properties of the laplace transform we can find @xmath56 explicitly , but its representation is enough complicated and expressed through a integral of the wright functions @xcite . for our calculation it will be sufficient to know only the function @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , we will not present any explicit form @xmath56 here .",
    "if in eq.([eqa1 ] ) the value @xmath16 will depend on time as @xmath62 , we come to the description of the kohlrausch - williams - watts ( kww ) relaxation .",
    "although such a equation does not contain any ( for example , micro / mesoscopic and so on ) details about relaxation processes , it is convenient for practical purpose because of its simplicity . when the relaxation follows the cc ,",
    "cd ( cole - davidson ) , hn laws , the equation ( [ eqa1 ] ) is not so simple as in the case of d and kww relaxation .",
    "recall that the cc relaxation and response functions can be expressed in terms of a solution of the fractional differential equation @xcite . with macroscopic equations for the cd and hn responses",
    "the situation becomes more else complicated .",
    "consider the derivation of the macroscopic response equation of tempered relaxation in more details .    for a general type of a markovian process",
    "the general kinetic equation is @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes the transition rate operator ( see details , in @xcite ) .",

    ", one can find the moments by taking the derivative with respect to @xmath77 and then setting @xmath79 .",
    "the generating function of the process governed by the stochastic time clock is given by the relation @xmath80 thus , the generating function for a discrete markovian process directed by a subordinated process can be obtained from the appropriate generating function of the parent process by immediate integration .",

    "the parameter @xmath98 is the characteristic frequency of the relaxing system .",

    "the frequency dependence of the dielectric susceptibility for orientational polarization of dipoles has been the subject of experimental and theoretical studies for many years , but still there is no any generally accepted theory capable of explaining the observed phenomena .",
    "experimentally it is well known that the complex dielectric susceptibility @xmath101 of most dipolar substances demonstrates a peak in the loss component @xmath102 at a characteristic frequency @xmath103 , and it is characterized by high- ( @xmath104 ) and low - frequency ( @xmath105 ) dependencies .",

    "the approach permits ones to consider many relaxation laws on the unique theoretical base originating from the stochastic nature of relaxation .",
    "the general probabilistic formalism treats the relaxation of the complex systems regardless of the precise nature of local interactions .",
    "following this approach , we have derived the empirical relaxation laws and their macroscopic equations , have characterized their parameters , have connected the parameters with local random characteristics of the relaxation processes , have demonstrated how to make the transition from the microscopic random dynamics in the complex stochastic systems to the macroscopic deterministic description by integro - differential equations .",
    "it should be pointed out that the form of these equations is a direct sign of complexity evolution in such systems .",
    "although we restricted only by the detailed analysis of two - state systems , due to eq.([eq14 ] ) , this consideration can be developed to the study of many - state systems ( as an example , see the analysis of the three - state fractional system in @xcite ) ) .",
    "the tempered relaxation establishes a connection between several types of relaxation ( d , cc and cd ) .",
    "its asymptotic behavior earnestly shows that starting as a non - exponential relaxation , latter it tends to the d law .",
    "moreover , the theory of subordination suggests a clear interpretation of the tempered relaxation . as applied to the dielectric relaxation , the interaction of dipoles with each other and their environment has a confined time of action on the relaxation process near a starting point of relaxation .",
    "latter they behave independently just as this is the case of exponential ( d ) relaxation . to put it in another way ,",
    "the dipoles are strongly connected with each other in the initial stage of relaxation ( and , therefore , their response function obeys a non - exponential decay ) , but the connection is not long - lived , and in an interval of time each dipole evaluates on its own .",
