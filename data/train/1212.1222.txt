    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ? * ) has had impacts in astronomy far beyond its main mission of exploring the three - dimensional structure of our universe .",
    "the sloan extension for galactic exploration and understanding survey ( segue , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , part of the second - generation sdss surveys , extended the survey s mission to unraveling the nature and structure of our own milky way galaxy by targeting mostly new fields in and around the galactic disc . as a result , the spatial distribution of the new ( largely galactic disc ) white dwarf stars in this catalog will be very different from those in the earlier catalogs from sdss data releases 1 @xcite and 4 @xcite where the focus was on extragalactic objects and the galactic disc was purposefully avoided .",
    "the study of white dwarf stars has benefited greatly from the increased number of objects provided by the sdss , there being 66 papers between 2005 and 2012 reported by the sao / nasa astrophysics data system , for example , with _ sdss _ and _ white dwarf _ in the title .",
    "numerous other papers refer to sdss - discovered white dwarf stars without indicating so in the title . the first full white dwarf catalog from sdss data @xcite , based on sdss data release 1 ( dr1 , * ?",
    "* ) , roughly doubled the number of then known white dwarf stars . using data from the sdss data release 4 ( dr4 , * ? ? ? * ) , @xcite reported over 9000 spectroscopically - confirmed white dwarfs stars from the sdss , again roughly doubling the combined number of white dwarf stars known after sdss dr1 . with the release of data release 7 from the sdss ( dr7 , * ? ? ? * ) , we again roughly double the number of identified white dwarf stars compared to those in the dr4 sample .",
    "the first release of segue data started in sdss data release 6 @xcite , with more released in sdss data release 7 @xcite .",
    "in the original sdss survey , white dwarf spectra were obtained primarily as a bi - product of other high - priority categories of targets .",
    "almost all were hot white dwarf stars because white dwarf stars cooler than @xmath1 7000k have colors similar to the more numerous fgk main sequence stars which were specifically not targeted .",
    "most of the white dwarf stars in the survey were not targeted for spectroscopy as white dwarf star candidates and were instead rejects from targeting algorithms for other kinds of objects ; @xcite discuss the details of the dr1 target selection and the makeup of the white dwarf spectroscopic sample .",
    "the segue survey , however , specifically targets stars ( see http://www.sdss3.org/dr8/algorithms/segueii/segue_target_selection.php ) and cool white dwarf stars were effectively targeted for the first time using their reduced proper motions .",
    "the net result is that the number of white dwarf stars observed per sdss spectroscopic plate has remained roughly constant at  25/plate through each sdss data release , although the selection mechanism is significantly different .    here , we report on the white dwarf catalog built from the sdss data release 7 .",
    "we have applied automated techniques supplemented by complete , consistent human identifications of each candidate white dwarf spectrum .",
    "we make use of the latest sdss reductions and white dwarf model atmosphere improvements in our spectral fits , providing @xmath0 and @xmath2 determinations for each identified clean da and db where we use the word _",
    "clean _ to identify spectra that show only features of non - magnetic , non - mixed , da or db stars .",
    "our catalog includes all white dwarf stars from the earlier @xcite and @xcite catalogs , although occasionally with different identifications , as discussed below .    looking for infrared excesses around da white dwarf stars , @xcite use a photometric method to identify da white dwarf stars with @xmath3 from the sdss and",
    "find 4636 spectroscopically - confirmed das in dr7 with another 5819 expected das in the photometric sample .",
    "our sample is not magnitude - selected ( although classifications typically get more uncertain for @xmath4 and below ) and includes db and all other white dwarf subtypes as well .",
    "we do not , however , consider candidate white dwarf stars that do not have sdss spectra .",
    "we note that although we did not fit white dwarf plus main sequence models to our apparently composite spectra , others @xcite have specifically studied these spectra .",
    "sdss dr7 contains over 1.6 million spectra and we did not have the facilities to fit and identify each spectrum .",
    "we therefore had to extract a smaller subsample of candidates from these spectra that we could later fit and examine as possible white dwarf stars . to form our candidate sample , we employed two different techniques",
    ". first , we reproduced the candidate selection from @xcite , but implemented it completely within the sdss dr7 catalog archive server ( cas ) as an sql query .",
    "this query returned 24189 objects .",
    "second , we used the sdss and segue target classification and spectrum analysis fields and selected any object that was either targeted as a possible white dwarf star or whose spectrum was determined to likely be any kind of white dwarf star .",
    "this query returned 48198 spectrum ids .",
    "both queries are listed in full in the appendix and queried all available dr7 spectra via the specobjall table .    combined",
    ", these queries resulted in 53408 unique spectra , of which 5209 uniquely satisfied the @xcite criteria and 29218 uniquely satisfied the new target / classification criteria .",
    "18981 spectra satisfied both .",
    "later , we discovered that 4362 sky spectra made our sample ( they should have been explicitly excluded from our queries , but were not ) , so these were deleted and the resulting sample size became 49046 spectra .",
    "ultimately , 4% of the objects which were selected only by the targeting criteria , 36% of those selected only by the @xcite criteria , and 90% of those that satisfied both criteria were labeled as white dwarf stars .",
    "the combined set of criteria is a very powerful way to identify white dwarf spectra in the sdss , accounting for 83% of our identified white dwarf stars .",
    "only 17% of the identified white dwarf stars , therefore , satisfied just one of the two selection criteria .",
    "we further pared our sample by using lists of previously - identified sdss spectra .",
    "we removed the known quasars @xcite , bl  lacs @xcite , and once run through our da and db model - fitting program , we fit the rejects with galaxy and quasar templates @xcite to remove these objects from further consideration .",
    "this process removed an additional 6892 spectra , resulting in a final sample of 42154 spectra .",
    "the mechanics of our _ autofit  _ fitting program , which fits the observed spectra to our synthetic model spectral grid by @xmath5 minimization , remain the same as described in @xcite and @xcite , but substantial improvements have been made to our atmospheric model grid , both in the model physics and the parameters of the grid itself .",
    "we use updated koester @xcite model atmospheres , with the following significant changes since @xcite :    * for the ten lowest balmer and lyman lines , the standard vcs tables @xcite were replaced with new tables calculated by @xcite .",
    "these calculations consistently include the hummer - mihalas occupation probability formalism into the profile calculation .",
    "* the stark broadening profiles from @xcite for hydrogen have been convolved with the neutral broadening profiles to add another dimension for the neutral particle density to the broadening tables .",
    "for the three lowest balmer lines , we used the self - broadening data of @xcite .",
    "for the higher series members , we used the sum of resonance @xcite and van der waals broadening @xcite . for the helium lines , we used self - broadening data from @xcite and @xcite . for the remaining lines , simple estimates for",
    "resonance and van der waals broadening were used . *",
    "the holtsmark microfield distribution was replaced by the hooper ( 1966 , 1968 ) distribution using the approximations in nayfonov et al .",
    "this distribution includes correlations between the charged perturber particles .",
    "the changes in the occupation probabilities for higher balmer lines , where the occupation probability varies between 0.11.0 , are quite significant .",
    "* for the dbs , we now use the @xmath6 approximation .",
    "we find that this value best describes the location of the dbv instability strip @xcite .",
    "@xcite , in particular , exclude values of @xmath7 through their analysis of the the convection zone for the pulsating db white dwarf , gd  358 while @xcite justify this value in their atmospheric modeling .",
    "* for the das , we use @xmath8 . note that with the use of these improved stark profiles , @xcite showed that a slightly more efficient convective energy transport with @xmath9 should be used , although we feel our atmospheric parameters with @xmath10 are appropriate in the present context .",
    "our model grid now extends to @xmath11 and is denser than that used in @xcite and @xcite . for das",
    ", the grid extends in @xmath0 from 5.0 to 10.0 in steps of 0.25 while @xmath2 goes from 6000k to 10000k in steps of 250k , 10000k to 14000k in steps of 100k , 14000k to 20000k in steps of 250k , 20000k to 50000k in steps of 1000k , and 50000k to 100000k in steps of 2500k .",
    "the db grid runs from @xmath12 7.0 to 10.0 in steps of 0.25 , with @xmath2 extending from 10000k to 18000k in steps of 250k and from 18000k to 50000k in steps of 1000k .",
    "once we completed our candidate list , we fit all 42154 candidate white dwarf spectra and colors with our _ autofit  _ code described in @xcite and @xcite . _",
    "autofit _ fits only clean da and db models , so does not recognize other types of white dwarf stars .",
    "in addition to the best fitting model parameters , it also outputs a goodness of fit estimate and several quality control checks and flags for other features noted in the spectrum or fit .",
    "we took the output from _",
    "autofit  _ and separated the results into good da and db fits ( 14271 spectra ) and all else ( 27883 spectra ) .",
    "we looked at all the good da and db fits to verify they were indeed normal das and dbs and made about 1000 i d changes . in almost all cases , we agreed each spectrum was one of a da or db white dwarf star , but found they also contained additional spectral features not fit by our models , resulting in new identifications like dab , dah , da+m , etc",
    ". we also looked at each spectrum _ autofit  _ failed to classify as a da or db dwarf star , identifying some as other white dwarf subtypes while most were simply other non - white - dwarf stellar spectra .      since _",
    "autofit  _ can only classify clean da and db spectra , we knew we would have to look at its rejected spectra for other white dwarf spectral types . because we were interested in obtaining accurate mass distributions for our da and db stars , we were conservative in labeling a spectrum as a clean da or db .",
    "that is , we were liberal in adding additional subtypes and uncertainty notations if we saw signs of other elements , companions , or magnetic fields in the spectra .",
    "while some of our mixed white dwarf subtypes would probably be identified as clean das or dbs with better signal - to - noise spectra , few of our identified clean das or dbs would likely be found to have additional spectral features within our detection limit .    to aid searching for other white dwarf subtypes beyond the das and dbs , we selected all objects that had not been successfully fitted as a da or db star by _",
    "autofit  _ and then further selected only those with @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "the color cuts helped to limit interlopers since most white dwarf stars fall within these ranges and the magnitude cut simply helps ensure a signal to noise ratio high enough to allow spectral identification .",
    "we thus obtained a list of 7864 objects that were then spectrally classified as discussed below .",
    "in general , we looked for the following features to aid in the classification for each specified white dwarf subtype :    * balmer lines  normally broad and with a balmer decrement [ da but also dab , dba , dza , and subdwarfs ] * hei 4471  [ db , subdwarfs ] * heii 4686  [ do , pg1159 , subdwarfs ] * c2 swan band or atomic ci lines [ dq ] * caii h & k [ dz , daz ] * cii 4367  [ hotdq ] * zeeman splitting [ magnetic da ] * featureless spectrum with significant proper motion [ dc ] * flux increasing in the red [ binary , most probably m companion ]    many of the stars analyzed in this way turned out to be genuine da or db white dwarf stars that had been rejected by _",
    "autofit  _ for lack of signal to noise , too many bad pixels in the spectra , uncertain colors , etc .",
    "many were also multi - subtype white dwarf stars like dah , dba , daz , dbz or da+m and db+m .",
    "we found many objects with both strong balmer lines and hei lines .",
    "these objects are likely double degenerate binaries composed of a da and a db white dwarf , but following standard nomenclature , we simply classified them as dab or dba , as appropriate .",
    "another group of objects had balmer lines less deep than what is expected for da white dwarf stars with their derived effective temperatures .",
    "these stars are also most likely double degenerates consisting of a da and a dc white dwarf stars , but were classified as da .",
    "@xcite analyze these potential double degenerates .",
    "we also found a group of stars to have a very steep balmer decrement ( i.e. only a broad h@xmath16 and sometimes h@xmath17 is observed while the other lines are absent ) that could not be fit with a pure hydrogen grid .",
    "we find that these objects are best explained as helium - rich das , as confirmed by fits with a grid of helium - rich white dwarf stars with traces of hydrogen ( see * ? ? ?",
    "these white dwarf stars are most probably former dza where all the metals have gravitationally settled while the hydrogen still floats at the surface .    for the other spectral types ( dc , dz , dq and hotdq )",
    ", we used an appropriate grid and fitted the spectroscopic and photometric data ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) to confirm the classification .",
    "objects that could not be fitted using one of the grids were thus easily spotted and put in the non - white - dwarf category .",
    "we finally note that the white dwarf color space also contains many hot subdwarfs .",
    "it is difficult , just by looking at a spectrum , to tell a low mass white dwarf from a subdwarf . to guide us in the classification of hot stars",
    ", we superposed over the observed spectra a @xmath18 model at the effective temperature given by a fit to the ugriz colors .",
    "we then rejected objects showing lines much less broad than the synthetic spectrum .",
    "we also declared a subdwarf to be anything labeled as a subdwarf ( `` sd '' ) , db , or da by our _ autofit  _ code with a @xmath0 of 6.5 or less and human - classified as either a subdwarf or a da or db . since the _ autofit_-measured values of @xmath2 and @xmath0 are not reliable for anything other than a clean da / db spectrum , anything that passed the _",
    "autofit  _ subdwarf criteria , but was human - classified as anything other than a subdwarf or clean da / db was not classified as a subdwarf .",

    "as discussed in the @xcite and @xcite catalogs , the spectroscopic sample of white dwarf stars from the sdss is not at all complete .",
    "that is , not every white dwarf star in the sdss photometric survey has a corresponding sdss spectrum .",
    "there are many complex biases and selection effects based on the many different criteria used to obtain these white dwarf spectra .",
    "each individual criterion has a different priority when it comes to designating objects in a given part of the sky for follow - up spectroscopy , since the selection criteria , weights , and biases , however , are all known , the completeness of our spectroscopic white dwarf sample is knowable , but is beyond the focus of this work .",
    "since we did not look at , or even fit , every sdss spectrum in dr7 , we do need to estimate how complete our catalog is compared to the overall , but unknown , sdss spectroscopic white dwarf sample .",
    "did we recover every white dwarf with a spectrum in dr7 ?",
    "one way we can address this question is to see how many of the @xcite and @xcite white dwarf stars we recovered in our new catalog since our candidate selection and fitting were done independently of the earlier catalogs .",
    "when comparing our catalog with table  11 from @xcite , we found 241 missing out of 10090 objects or about 2.4% .",
    "we then added the missing spectra to our candidate list and proceeded to analyze them along with the rest of our candidates .",
    "a spot check of these objects showed that they do nt pass the color cuts described in section  3.1 of @xcite in either the sdss dr4 or dr7 database .",
    "@xcite used some preliminary photometry in the early candidate selection process and did not redo the candidate selection once the released dr4 photometry became available , so this likely explains why we did not pick them up in our candidate list .",
    "the completeness of this catalog , therefore , ought to be at least as good as that of @xcite .",
    "doing a similar test with table  5 from @xcite resulted in 258 white dwarf stars from the dr1 catalog not making our candidate list .",
    "53 of them belong to plate - mjd pairs which are not part of dr7 and 72 stars were the same as those missing from the @xcite dr4 catalog .",
    "so , combined , there were 183 out of 2971 stars from the dr1 catalog , or @xmath20 not included in either our original candidate list or in the dr4 catalog .",
    "the candidate selection parameter space in the dr1 catalog @xcite , though , was much more extensive that that used in the dr4 catalog @xcite , and thus , here .",
    "so that missing parameter space , if included here , would probably result in another 600 or so white dwarf stars , most of which would be cooler and overlap the a and f main sequence star region .",

    "these plots suggests that below @xmath32 , at least half of our @xmath33 dah identifications are likely magnetic and that spectra below @xmath34 ought to be confirmed with higher signal to noise and possibly higher resolution spectra before declaring them magnetic or not .      to calculate the the mass of",
    "our identified clean da and db stars from the @xmath35 and @xmath22 values obtained from our fits , we used the mass - radius relations of @xcite for carbon - oxygen da white dwarfs .",
    "these relations are based on full evolutionary calculations appropriate for the study of hydrogen - rich da white dwarfs that take into account the full evolution of progenitor stars from the zero - age main sequence through the core hydrogen - burning phase , the helium - burning phase , and the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch phase .",
    "the stellar mass values of the resulting sequences are : 0.525 , 0.547 , 0.570 , 0.593 , 0.609 , 0.632 , 0.659 , 0.705 , 0.767 , 0.837 , and 0.878  @xmath36 .",
    "these sequences are supplemented by sequences of 0.935 and 0.98  @xmath36 calculated specifically for this work . for high - gravity white dwarf stars , we employed the mass - radius relations for oxygen / neon core white dwarf stars given in @xcite in the mass range from 1.06 to 1.36  @xmath36 with a step of 0.02  @xmath36 . for the low - gravity white dwarf stars",
    ", we used the evolutionary calculations of @xcite for helium - core white dwarf stars .",
    "these sequences are characterized by stellar mass values of 0.22 , 0.25 , 0.303 , 0.40 and 0.452  @xmath36 .",
    "they were complemented with the sequences of 0.169 and 0.196  @xmath36 taken from @xcite .    for db white dwarf stars , we relied on the evolutionary calculations of hydrogen - deficient white dwarf stars of 0.515 , 0.530 , 0.542 , 0.565 , 0.584 , 0.609 , 0.664 , 0.741 and 0.870  @xmath36 computed by @xcite .",
    "these sequences constitute an improvement over previous calculations . in particular , they have been derived from the born - again episode responsible for the hydrogen deficiency . for high - gravity dbs , we used the oxygen / neon evolutionary sequences described above for the case of a hydrogen - deficient composition .",
    "these evolutionary sequences constitute a complete and homogeneous grid of white dwarf models that captures the core features of progenitor evolution , in particular the internal chemical structures expected in the different types of white dwarf stars .",
    "to calculate reliable mass distributions , we selected only the best s / n spectra with temperatures well fit by our models .",
    "we find reliable classifications can be had from spectra with s / n @xmath37 15 , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "we classified 14120 spectra as clean das , but selecting the highest s / n spectra for those with duplicate spectra , we are left with 12813 clean da stars .",
    "of these das , 3577 have a spectrum with s / n @xmath38 , with a mean s / n=@xmath39 . using this sample ,",
    "we obtain @xmath40 .",
    "this mean mass estimate is incorrect , however , if we believe the apparent increase in fit @xmath0 at low @xmath19 is an artifact of our models and not inherent in the stars .",
    "although @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite all show an increase in measured @xmath0 for das with measured temperatures of order 1200013000k or less , this increase is probably due to missing physics in the models and not due to the stars , since the photometric determinations and gravitational redshifts @xcite do not show this @xmath0 increase .",
    "we therefore further restricted our sample to those das with a measured @xmath41 , and from a sample of now 2217 objects , we determined @xmath42 .    our mean da mass is smaller than that of @xcite , even though we are using the same stark broadening and microfield as they are .",
    "our sample is 5 times larger , however , and we have removed suspected magnetic das from our sample , which would otherwise increase our measured mean mass .",
    "@xcite , with the same models as @xcite , obtained a mean mass of @xmath43 for their kiso survey da sample , and @xmath44 for their db sample .",
    "@xcite determined the mean ensemble mass of a sample of 449 das observed in the eso sn ia progenitor survey ( spy ) project , using their mean gravitational redshift and found @xmath45 , a value substantially higher than ours .",
    "this value is independent of the line profiles themselves and therefore should not be affected by linear magnetic field effects . at the resolution of the spy data @xcite , @xcite were able to identify fields larger than 90  kg , so the contribution of nonlinear magnetic effects should also be negligible .",
    "@xcite , using @xmath46 models , find @xmath47 by fitting line profiles for high s / n spectra for stars hotter than @xmath48  k. @xcite also report a mean mass of @xmath49 for their asteroseismological analysis of 44 bright pulsating da ( zz  ceti , or dav ) stars .    if @xmath50 of our @xmath51 stars were non - magnetic with masses of order @xmath52 , our mean da mass would rise to @xmath53 , more consistent with previous measurements .",
    "such a number , though , would require all our identified magnetic stars , and then some , to be both massive and non - magnetic , so our lower mass estimate can be only partially explained by our magnetic white dwarf identifications .",
    "additionally , we note that the @xcite re - analysis of the dr4 white dwarf stars resulted in a measurement of @xmath54 , again lower than most previous studies and similar to our new measurement .",
    "the 1011 spectra we classified as clean dbs belong to 923 stars .",
    "191 of these have a spectral s / n @xmath38 , with a mean s / n=@xmath55 . using this high s / n sample ,",
    "we obtain @xmath56 . restricting this sample to just those hotter than @xmath57  k , again assuming the increase in measured @xmath0 seen below this temperature is an artifact of the models and not inherent to the stars , we obtain 140 stars , resulting in @xmath58 .",
    "the masses of das and dbs are therefore statistically different , as also found by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this difference is consistent with the possibility that dbs come through a very late thermal pulse phase , which burns the remaining surface h after reaching the white dwarf cooling phase .",
    "figure  [ fig : hist ] shows the obtained mass histograms for our final da and db samples .",
    "@xcite and @xcite show that of the total of 98 dbs known then , none were known in the temperature range @xmath59  k. they created the term _ db gap _ for this observed dearth of helium dominated atmosphere white dwarfs in this temperature region .",
    "subsequent db studies did not find more than one star in this temperature range , until the 10 to 28 dbs and dos found in dr4 by @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that nlte effects change the measured @xmath2 by less than 15% over those obtained by lte atmosphere models like we use , too small a difference to move all the stars within the db gap , outside of it .    of the 923 stars we classified as clean dbs",
    ", we find 9 hotter than @xmath60  k , 30 with @xmath61  k , and 231 with @xmath62  k. if we restrict ourselves to only the 57 ( of the 923 ) stars with s / n@xmath63 , we find 1",
    "hotter than @xmath60  k , 3 with @xmath64  k , and 18 with @xmath65  k , following the ratio expected from their ages ( 1/6:1/18:1 , * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) .",
    "our numbers are in line with the @xcite finding that there is a decrease in the number , although not a _ gap _ , of dbs around 3000045000k in relation to the hotter do range .    as evidenced in @xcite , for example",
    ", fitting a large sample such as this with model db stars consisting of pure helium atmospheres , as we have done here , is not completely correct .",
    "even small ( ie . , undetectable ) amounts of trace hydrogen in the helium layer of a db can cause significant errors to @xmath19 and @xmath0 determinations made by fitting pure helium outer atmospheres .",
    "hence , our results here are indicative of an avenue worth exploring , but more detailed fitting may be needed to arrive at more concrete conclusions .",
    "by classifying all our candidate white dwarf spectra by eye , supplemented by our _ autofit  _ fitting of our da and db spectra , we roughly doubled the number of previously known white dwarf stars and formed a large sample of clean da and db spectra in order to study their mass distributions .",
    "our identifications are conservative in that we wanted to make sure we had a clean da and db samples for our mass analyses , so we erred , if at all , on the side of overinterpreting the spectra rather than underinterpreting them . as a result",
    ", we identified a number of low field magnetic white dwarf stars that represent a 5-fold increase in the number of known magnetic white dwarf stars .",
    "we nonetheless believe these identifications are correct and suggest that previous mass distribution analyses may have been biased towards higher masses , given that these low - field magnetic stars were not previously recognized as magnetic in earlier mass distribution measurements .",
    "our mean masses were determined only for stars with spectra conservatively identified as clean das and dbs with @xmath66 . perhaps as a result of this careful spectral selection , or",
    "perhaps as a result of our increased sample size , we find mean masses for das and dbs are smaller than those by @xcite and @xcite . our comparisons to previous literature determinations , where available , reveal no obvious biases in our measurements , although the various magnitude and color limits in the different targeting categories , and the signal to noise ratios required for accurate identifications are certainly selection effects that could subtly affect our results .",
    "furthermore , as figure  [ fig : histg ] shows , our @xmath0 distributions qualitatively reproduce the difference we found in the mass determinations , indicating the discrepancy is at least not solely due to our conversions from @xmath0 to mass .",
    "there is no reason to expect the observed mass distribution to be gaussian .",
    "the ingredients are the initial mass function , initial to final mass relation , star formation rate , and mass loss rates , all of which are more or less well defined physical non - gaussian relations .",
    "we find it informational , however , to use gaussian deconvolutions of the mass distributions so we can talk about average / peak masses with some quantifiable meaning attached .",
    "we do not claim that each gaussian component represents a unique contribution to the da / db population .",
    "figures  [ fig : histe ] and  [ fig : histedb ] show the da and db mass distributions , respectively , broken down into their gaussian components .",
    "table  [ tb : gfits ] lists the mass peaks and percentage of objects contained within each .",
    "the figures clearly indicate that talking about a mean da mass is not particularly useful , but a peak mass ( seen here at @xmath67 ) is more useful .",
    "the low and high mass wings of the da distributions are not symmetric , nor should they likely be , given the age of the universe ultimately determining the low mass cutoff for single white dwarf stars .",
    "the low mass da component , at @xmath68 with 4% of the stars , is probably caused by binary interactions since single star evolutionary models can not generate these stars in a hubble time , while the smaller high mass peak at @xmath69 is likely due to mergers .",
    "the peak of the db mass distribution ( figure  [ fig : histedb ] ) at @xmath70 is similar that of the da distribution although the overall shape is quite different .",
    "lrc da & & + 1 & 0.589 & 56 + 2 & 0.587 & 25 + 3 & 0.822 & 13 + 4 & 0.389 &  6 + db & & + 1 & 0.693 & 39 + 2 & 0.640 & 35 + 3 & 0.599 & 26 +    the @xmath19 distributions shown in figure  [ fig : histteff ] do not reveal a db gap , i.e. , we do detect stars with hei dominated atmospheres hotter than @xmath71  k , but there does seem to be a decrease of cooler dbs , which simply become dcs , dqs , dzs as they cool below @xmath72k .    although our measured mean mass for our db sample is higher than that of our das , the mass distributions show that the largest number of dbs have masses similar to peak da distribution .",
    "the high mass tail of the db distribution could be the result of a varying number of thermal pulses or of varying metallicity in the db progenitors .",
    "it may also be that the higher mass db progenitors are simply more prone to experience a very late thermal pulse than are lower mass db progenitors .",
    "the trace low mass component in the the db distribution may be associated with am cvn stars , double he wds , and a result of binary evolution .",
