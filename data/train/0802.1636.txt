    "according to current models of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , ultrarelativistic motion of the jet pointing toward the observer takes place in their sources ( see reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "their afterglows in x - ray , optical , and radio bands are explained by the radiation that emerges at the front of the external shock produced by jet interaction with the ambient interstellar medium surrounding the source . in this case , a variable light curve can not emerge from a homogeneous spherical emitting shell , that moves inside a cone with the opening angle @xmath8 , where @xmath9  the lorentz factor of the jet .",
    "for the remote observer , the variability time scale should be @xmath10 .    however , the variability of optical afterglows at time scales @xmath11 is observed in many cases . the best - known is grb 030329 whose afterglow was studied in great detail due to its exceptional brightness @xcite .",
    "similar variability was also observed in other cases where detailed measurements of the light curve were obtained : grb 021004 ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , 050408 @xcite , 060526 @xcite and others .    various explanations for the variability of grb afterglows were discussed in detail by @xcite , who also established constraints on the afterglow variability time scales and amplitudes for various models .",
    "they are all based on the assumption of ultrarelativistic motion of the jet . in some",
    "observed afterglows , the constraints obtained in simple models of the jet are violated @xcite .",
    "however , the motion may well become moderately relativistic on the observed time scales in case of higher density of the ambient medium or in presence of a dense stellar wind .",
    "for example , @xcite discussed this possibility for the afterglow of grb 990123 and showed that the transition to a nonrelativistic motion on a time scale of about 2.5 days occurs if the density of the surrounding medium is @xmath12  @xmath4 . in this paper , the sideways expansion of the jet once the condition",
    "@xmath13 is satisfied @xcite was not taken into account . because of this expansion , the jet collects more material on its way and slows down faster .    in this note , we discuss various estimates of the time of the transition to subrelativistic motion and show that it may well be @xmath7 day .",
    "the most simple estimate of the time pf the transition to nonrelativistic motion , @xmath14 , taking into account the sideways expansion of the jet , was obtained by @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the `` isotropic '' energy of the shell in units of @xmath17  erg / s/@xmath18 , @xmath19 is the particle number density in the medium surrounding the source in units of @xmath4 , and @xmath20  is the jet opening angle .",
    "this estimate was obtained using the dependency @xmath21 for adiabatic shell and assuming that the motion after the onset of jet sideways expansion approaches a spherically symmetric one and take place according to the same adiabatic solutions . in order of magnitude , it agrees well with the other estimates that can be obtained from a more comprehensive analysis of the jet dynamics .",
    "for example , if the jet begins to expand at @xmath22 , then , given that after that the gamma factor depends on the observed time as @xmath23 @xcite , we will obtain : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the time of the beginning of jet sideways expansion . if we take the expression for @xmath25 from @xcite , then @xmath26  days with the same parameter dependency as above .",
    "@xcite assumed that the jet in its rest frame expands with the speed of sound @xmath27 , not with the speed of light .",
    "accordingly , the jet expansion begins later , at @xmath28 . using the @xmath21 dependency from this work and applying the same inference as above ,",
    "we obtain @xmath29  days for the same parameters .",
    "@xcite assumed that the jet also expands with the speed of sound .",
    "they pointed out that , when @xmath30 , the shell ceases to be ultrarelativistic even before the onset of the sideways expansion . in this work ,",
    "@xmath14 was estimated explicitly .",
    "rewriting it with our parameters , we obtain @xmath31  days , with the same parameter dependency as in ( [ eq : waxman ] ) .",
    "if we take into account that initially the motion of the shell may not be adiabatic and it can lose a substantial part of its energy through radiation , then the estimate of @xmath14 can decrease significantly . for synchrotron radiation , the motion should be radiative if much of the energy that the material gains at the shock front goes into the accelerated electrons and if the electrons cool down rapidly compared to the dynamical time .",
    "the latter always holds at the beginning of shell motion . the expression for the energy , to be used to calculate the subsequent adiabatic motion if the evolution was initially radiative is given by @xcite . substituting this energy into ( [ eq : waxman ] )",
    "yields : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the energy density fractions of the magnetic field and accelerated electrons behind the shock , @xmath35 is the initial gamma factor of the ejecta . this estimate should be used if it is assumed that @xmath36 , i.e. , the electrons are accelerated effectively at the shock front .",
    "the estimate of @xmath14 for a stellar wind with a density proportional to @xmath37 can be taken from @xcite . rewriting it with our typical parameters",
    ", we will obtain : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the mass loss rate of the star in units of @xmath40year@xmath41 and @xmath42 is the wind velocity in units @xmath43  km  s@xmath41 .",
    "if the electrons are accelerated effectively and the evolution is initially radiative , then this estimate should be much smaller , just as in the above case of a constant - density medium .",
    "from these estimates we see , that the observed transition time to nonrelativistic motion is @xmath1  days even for the commonly accepted typical parameters . a higher density of the ambient medium @xmath44  @xmath4 for an adiabatic shock , or @xmath45",
    "@xmath4 , if the electrons at the shock front are accelerated effectively and the shell is initially radiative , or a stellar wind with @xmath46@xmath6  year@xmath41 is required for @xmath47  day .",
    "a higher density of the interstellar medium is actually may well be expected near grb sources , since at least a large fraction of them are related to supernova explosions at the end of the evolution of massive stars and occur in regions of enhanced star formation ( see , e.g. , the review by * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "in addition , massive stars at the end of their evolution intensively lose their outer layers and should be surrounded by dense stellar winds ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . in some cases , the presence of a wind around grb sources is confirmed observationally .",
    "for example , high - resolution spectroscopy of the grb 021004 afterglow shows that its progenitor was a massive wolf - rayet star surrounded by a wind with a mass loss rate of @xmath48  year@xmath41 and an the expansion velocity up to @xmath49  km  s@xmath41 @xcite .",
    "if the motion is no longer ultrarelativistic , then the fast variability of the afterglow on a time scale @xmath50 can be explained , for example , by the presence of density inhomogeneities .",
    "in fact , the presence of these inhomogeneities can also be expected .",
    "for example , the stellar winds around wolf - rayet stars are known to be highly inhomogeneous and to have a clumpy structure @xcite .",
    "in addition , the cooling time in the observed optical part of the spectrum should be short .",
    "this holds for the synchrotron spectrum at late evolutionary phases of the shock ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the transition to subrelativistic motion on the observed time scale of @xmath7  day is actually quite possible and , in this case , the fast variability of grb afterglows can be easily explained . of course",
    ", the fast variability of grb afterglows can also be explained under special assumptions in the case of an ultrarelativistic jet @xcite .",
    "however , the transition to a nonrelativistic motion should at least be considered as one of the possible explanations of this fast variability .",
    "this requires a higher density interstellar medium or dense stellar wind , which are expected in star forming regions and around massive wolf - rayet stars .",
