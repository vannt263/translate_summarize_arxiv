    "nuclear matter is not only a theoretical idealization providing benchmark studies of the effective nuclear interaction , but it is also believed to constitute the major baryonic component of massive objects in the universe , as exploding supernovae cores and neutron stars .",
    "the structure and properties of these astrophysical objects at baryonic densities exceeding normal nuclear matter density is still highly speculative @xcite .",
    "conversely for subsaturation densities it is well established that matter is mainly composed of neutrons , protons , electrons , positrons and photons in thermal and typically also chemical equilibrium @xcite . depending on the thermodynamic condition , neutrinos and anti - neutrinos can also participate to the equilibrium .",
    "such composite matter is subject to the contrasting couplings of the electromagnetic and the strong interaction . because of the electron screening , the two couplings act on comparable length scales giving rise to the phenomenon of frustration @xcite , well - known in condensed matter physics @xcite . because of this",
    ", a specific phase diagram , different from the one of nuclear matter and including inhomogeneous components , is expected in stellar matter @xcite .",
    "many theoretical studies exist at zero temperature . in a cold neutron star , going from the dilute crust to the dense core",
    ", a transition is known to occur from a solid phase constituted of finite nuclei on a wigner lattice immersed in a background of delocalized electrons and neutrons , through intermediate inhomogeneous phases composed of non - spherical nuclei ( pasta phases ) , to a liquid phase composed of uniform neutrons , protons and electrons @xcite .    at finite temperature",
    "the matter structure and properties are not as well settled .",
    "the most popular phenomenological approaches are the lattimer - swesty @xcite ( ls ) and the shen @xcite equation of state , recently updated in ref .",
    "@xcite . in these standard treatments currently used in most supernovae codes",
    ", the dilute stellar matter at finite temperature is described in the baryonic sector as a statistical equilibrium between protons , neutrons , alphas and a single heavy nucleus .",
    "the transition to homogeneous matter in the neutron star core is supposed to be first order in these modelizations and obtained through a maxwell construction in the total density at fixed proton fraction .",
    "it is clear that such single nucleus approximation ( sna ) is highly schematic and improvements are possible . concerning integrated quantities as thermodynamic functions and equations of state",
    ", such variables may be largely insensitive to the detailed matter composition @xcite , though we show in this paper that this is not always the case .",
    "however it is also known that the composition at relatively high density close to saturation , together with the pressure and symmetry energy , governs the electron capture rate , which in turn determines the proton fraction at bounce and the size of the homologous core , a key quantity to fix the strength of the shock - wave and the output of the supernovae explosion @xcite .",
    "moreover the composition may also affect the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements , which is still poorly understood @xcite , as well as the neutrino scattering through the core after bounce @xcite , and the cooling rate of neutron stars @xcite . for these reasons , in the recent years , many efforts have been done to improve over the simplistic representation of stellar matter given by the sna approach .",
    "the different modelizations which consider a possible distribution of all different nuclear species inside dilute stellar matter are known under the generic name of nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) @xcite . the basic idea behind these models is the fisher conjecture that strong interactions in dilute matter may be entirely exhausted by clusterization @xcite . in these approaches",
    "stellar matter in the baryonic sector is then viewed as a non - interacting ideal gas of all possible nuclear species in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the result is that thermodynamic quantities like entropies and pressure appear very similar to the ones calculated with standard approaches , while noticeable differences are seen in the matter composition .",
    "in particular an important contribution of light and intermediate mass fragments is seen at high temperature , which is neglected in standard sna approaches .",
    "the strongest limitation of nse - based approaches is that they completely neglect in - medium effects , which are known to be very important in nuclear matter .",
    "since the only nuclear interactions are given by the cluster self - energies , the homogeneous matter composing the neutron star core can not be modelized , nor it can be the phenomenon of neutron drip in the inner crust , well described by mean - field models @xcite .",
    "as a consequence , these models can not be applied at densities close to saturation and the crust - core transition can not be described .    to overcome this problem , different microscopic @xcite as well as phenomenological @xcite approaches",
    "have been developed in the very recent past . in this paper",
    "we would like to introduce a phenomenological model that treats the nuclei component within an improved nse , while it describes the unbound protons and neutrons in the finite temperature hartree - fock approximation .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "the first part of the paper is devoted to the description of the model .",
    "the clusterized component , the homogeneous component , the properties of the mixture and the lepton sector are described in successive sections together with their thermodynamic properties .",
    "a particular attention is devoted to the modelization of the crust - core transition .",
    "we show that the inclusion of excluded volume is sufficient to describe the transition from the clusterized crust to the homogeneous core , and that this transition is continuous .",
    "different generic as well as specific arguments are given against the possibility of a first - order transition .",
    "the second part of the paper gives some results relevant for the star matter phenomenology .",
    "the first section shows observables following constant chemical potential paths , in order to connect the observables with the properties of the phase diagram .",
    "then the behavior of the different quantities for constant proton fractions is displayed in order to compare with more standard treatments of supernova matter .",
    "finally the last section addresses the problem of neutrino trapping and the interplay between the matter opacity to neutrinos and matter composition .",
    "conclusions and outlooks conclude the paper .",
    "the model aims to describe the thermal and chemical properties of nuclear matter present in supernovae and ( proto)-neutron stars at densities ranging from the normal nuclear density @xmath3 to @xmath4 , temperatures between 0 and 20 mev and proton concentration between 0.5 and 0 . in this regime ,",
    "the star matter typically consists of a mixture of nucleons , light and heavy nuclear clusters , neutrinos ( if we consider the thermodynamic stage where neutrinos are trapped ) , photons and a charge neutralizing background of electrons and positrons .    as there is no interaction among electrons , neutrinos , photons and nuclear matter",

    "as we have already mentioned , the simultaneous presence of two different states characterized by a different average value for an order parameter ( here : baryonic density ) constitutes a phase coexistence if and only if the order parameter fluctuations ( here : density inhomogeneities ) occur on a length scale which is macrosocopic respect to the range of the interaction ( here : much larger than the femtometer scale of typical nuclei size ) .",
    "this condition on macroscopic scales is necessary because the gibbs construction neglects the interface energy and entropy , which is essential to describe thermodynamics of finite systems @xcite . since this is clearly not the case in stellar matter",
    ", surface and coulomb terms are sometimes added @xcite to approximately account for finite - size corrections .",
    "however we have shown in the last section that the modelization of a microscopic mixture between clusters and homogeneous matter is also a way to describe the intermediate configurations between core and crust .",
    "therefore we may ask if the two modelizations of phase mixture and phase coexistence are equivalent or at least lead to equivalent results for the observables of interest .    to clarify this point ,",
    "let us consider homogeneous and clusterized matter as two different possible phases for stellar matter which may coexist at a first - order transition point .",
    "the advantage of working with an hybrid ensemble as the proton - canonical ensemble defined above , is that the two - dimensional tangent construction implied by gibbs conditions in a multi - component first - order phase transition @xcite is reduced to a simple one - dimensional maxwell construction on the unique free extensive variable @xcite .",
    "it is important to stress that this procedure is just a technical simplification and the obtained equilibrium is exactly identical to the usual two - dimensional gibbs construction in the grancanonical ensemble .",
    "this construction in a legendre - transformed potential should not be confused with a maxwell construction on the @xmath160 equation of state performed on trajectories characterized by constant proton fractions @xmath161 , which is currently used in the literature @xcite and has no physical justification . indeed in a first - order phase transition in a two - component system the chemical composition of the two coexisting phases is never the same and the total pressure is a monotonically increasing function of the total density @xcite .",

    "the mean free path of the neutrinos depends on the eos and baryonic composition . during the collapse phase , it decreases as the star radius shrinks from  100 km to  10 km , such that it eventually becomes smaller than the star radius",
    "this final regime corresponds to the so - called full neutrino trapping , while the initial stage corresponds to neutrino transparency and is characterized by a vanishing neutrino chemical potential .",
    "full neutrino trapping is expected to occur also in post - bounce supernovae , when the matter is still dense .",
    "the transition between neutrino trapping and neutrino free streaming should in principle be a continuous process , obtained by solving the boltzmann equation for neutrino transport coupled with the hydrodynamics of the supernova evolution@xcite .",
    "in many actual simulations , schematic flux - limiting schemes are adopted in the diffusion approximation@xcite allowing regimes of partial neutrino trapping . in these modelizations",

    "the percentage of trapped neutrinos @xmath293 depends on time and on the local neutrino mean free path . determining this quantity",
    "consistently would require a full hydrodynamic calculation with a complete treatment of the weak processes implied , which is completely out of scope of the present paper . to study the interplay between trapping and matter composition we simply take the neutrino density @xmath294 at the given thermodynamic condition as a free parameter , linked to the opacity @xmath293 by @xmath295 .",
    "the scope of this analysis will then be to check whether the matter composition depends on the neutrino density , which would imply an extra self - consistent coupling between the baryon and the lepton sector .",
    "indeed if the cluster properties strongly vary during the transition between neutrino trapping and neutrino streaming , it would be necessary to couple the neutrino propagation with the calculation of the eos , which would be a very heavy numerical task .",
    "( [ eq : mu_e ] ) in section iid shows that for a relativistic fermi gas the particle density is univocally linked to its chemical potential . in the case of neutrinos , one can safely use the simpler @xmath54=0 expression of an ultra - relativistic degenerate fermi gas : @xmath296    the beta equilibrium equation ( [ eq : betaeq ] ) with a neutrino chemical potential @xmath297 fixed from eq.([munu ] ) such as to produce the chosen neutrino density @xmath298 , defines a trajectory in the @xmath299 , or equivalently @xmath42 plane .",

    "[ fig : neutrinos ] for different values of @xmath300 , covering the whole domain between full trapping @xmath301 and zero trapping @xmath302 .",
    "as one may remark , the constant @xmath300 paths roughly correspond to constant @xmath286 paths ( lines on the figure ) .",
    "moreover , the global isospin asymmetry of the matter increases monotonically with the percentage of trapped neutrinos and no significant dependence on temperature is observed .",
    "for instance , over the whole considered temperature domain the full neutrino trapping path lies along the @xmath303 path , while @xmath304 corresponds to @xmath286 slightly higher than 0.4 .",
    "these results are in good agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite , where only homogeneous nuclear matter was considered and no clusters were included .",
    "the extra information beared by the present work is that we can correlate the percentage of trapped neutrinos with the characteristics of the clusters .",
    "[ fig : amed - opacity ] displays the average cluster size ( left panels ) and isospin composition ( right panels ) as a function of total baryonic density at different temperatures along constant neutrino opacity paths . for the sake of completeness",
    ", no selection is now made with respect to the stability of the mixture .",
    "we can see that the size strongly depends on the thermodynamic conditions ( temperature and density ) but , in the cases in which homogeneous matter is stable , it is virtually independent of the opacity to neutrinos .",
    "this result can be understood from the fact that changing the percentage of trapped neutrinos at beta - equilibrium essentially amponts to changing the matter isospin asymmetry @xmath162 for a given total density @xmath185 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : neutrinos ] ) . in turn",
    ", this affects the chemical composition of clusters but not the cluster size , as we have already observed in discussing fig .",
    "[ fig : frag_wignerseitz ] .",
    "since the interaction probability of neutrinos with matter essentially depends on isoscalar quantities as the average cluster density and size @xcite , our result indicates that the problem of neutrino - baryon interaction can be effectively decoupled from the problem of the matter composition .",
    "in this paper we have presented a phenomenological model for stellar matter at finite temperature and sub - saturation densities which describes matter inhomogeneities as a continuous mixture of a distribution of loosely interacting clusters in statistical equilibrium , with free nucleons treated within the non - relativistic mean - field approximation .",
    "the two components interact through the electrostatic energy in the wigner - seitz approximation , and a configuration - dependent excluded volume term in the spirit of the van - der - waals gas .",
    "such mixture is demonstrated to minimize ( maximize ) the associated energetic ( entropic ) thermodynamic potential in the whole considered range of densities and temperature such that a stable solution can always be found . as a consequence , the transition from the homogeneous core to the inhomogeneous crust of a finite temperature neutron star",
    "is naturally obtained in the model , at variance with other approaches where discontinuous transitions have to be invoked .    in qualitative agreement with previous works based on nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) ,",
    "we find that the inclusion of a statistical distribution of clusters in low - density stellar matter modifies in an important way the average matter composition respect to standard treatments as the ls equation of state . for densities close to the transition density which are not accessible to nse models in a thermodynamically consistent way",
    ", we show that clustering has also sizeable consequences of thermodynamic quantities and equations of state . in particular both the symmetry energy and the baryonic energy",
    "are considerably altered by the presence of clusters , in agreement with the microscopic results of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "these results open different perspectives for future work which will be pursued in the next future .",
    "our formalism where the cluster partition sum is sampled within an exact , though numerical , monte - carlo procedure , allows to account for cluster correlations .",
    "we have already shown in a previous paper @xcite that going beyond the non - interacting nse approximation for cluster equilibrium has an important effect on the cluster phase diagram , and in the present work the configuration - dependent excluded volume correction , which phenomenologically accounts for the nuclear interaction , was shown to be responsible of the crust - core transition .",
    "the coulomb part of the interaction , which is presently treated in the usual one - body wigner - seitz approximation , could also be calculated exactly accounting for charge fluctuations inside the wigner - seitz cell . from the existing literature @xcite",
    "we expect that properly accounting for coulomb correlations induced by the charge fluctuations at the microscopic level may have an important influence on matter composition and thermodynamic features , particularly at high density and temperature where the configuration fluctuations are maximal .    in the regime of baryonic density close to saturation , we observe metastable and unstable solutions corresponding to bubble - like structures where small spherical clusters coexist with slightly diluted homogeneous matter .",
    "the possible persistence at high temperature of pasta - like structures , well documented at low temperature @xcite , is still an open question and it will be interesting to see if such exotic structures appear if deformation degrees of freedom are allowed in the configuration geometry and cluster energy functional .",
    "concerning the cluster energy functional , in this exploratory work we have employed a very simple and simplistic liquid - drop based expression .",
    "it will however be very easy to implement a composite functional giving the experimental masses at zero temperature and vanishing density , and evolving towards a parametric formulation at high density and temperature and for unknown neutron - rich nuclear species .    concerning the homogeneous matter functional , we plan to include pairing correlations within the finite temperature hfb approach as a natural extension of the present formalism , which will allow having a trustable equation of state at the lowest temperatures .",
    "finally , once the different physical inputs will be well settled , a longer range project consists in constructing a complete eos table for direct implementation in supernova and neutron stars codes , in the framework of the compstar project @xcite .",
