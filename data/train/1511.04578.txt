    "_ hyperbolic geometry was created in the first half of the nineteenth century in the midst of attempts to understand euclid s axiomatic basis for geometry . _",
    "the mathematicians at that time were mainly driven by the question whether the parallel axiom was redundant or not .",
    "it turned out that it was not . _",
    "hyperbolic geometry is now one type of non - euclidean geometry that discards the parallel axiom .",
    "einstein and minkowski found in non - euclidean geometry a geometric basis for the understanding of physical time and space .",
    "these negatively curved geometries , of which hyperbolic non - euclidean geometry is the prototype , are the generic forms of geometry .",
    "they have profound applications to the study of complex variables , to the topology of two- and three - dimensional manifolds , to group theory , to physics , and to other disparate fields of mathematics . _ outside mathematics , hyperbolic tesselations of the unit disk have been rendered very popular by the artist m.c .",
    "a nice introduction into hyperbolic geometry is , for example , given in the monograph @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "+    in our note we are interested in the poincar disk model .",
    "so let @xmath5 be the unit disk in the ( complex ) plane which we identify with @xmath6 .",
    "the lines / geodesics with respect to the hyperbolic geometry in this model are arcs of euclidean circles in @xmath0 that are orthogonal to the unit circle @xmath7 of @xmath0 ( see figure [ parallel - f ] ) . given a line @xmath8 in the hyperbolic geometry and a point @xmath9 not belonging to @xmath8 , there are infinitely many hyperbolic lines parallel to @xmath8 ( in other words disjoint from @xmath8 ) and passing through @xmath10 ( see figure [ parallel - f ] ) .",
    "the hyperbolic distance @xmath11 of two points @xmath10 and @xmath12 is the hyperbolic length of the associated geodesic and is therefore given by the integral @xmath13 over the unique circular arc @xmath14 passing through @xmath10 and @xmath12 and orthogonal to @xmath15 .",
    "note that @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is any smooth curve joining @xmath10 with @xmath12 . or if one prefers a nice formula : @xmath18    let @xmath19 \f  then @xmath20 is called the pseudohyperbolic distance of the two points @xmath21 and is given by @xmath22 in other words , @xmath23    it is this pseudohyperbolic distance that we will work with , because this seems to be the most suitable for function theoretic aspects .",
    "given @xmath9 and @xmath24 , let @xmath25 be the pseudohyperbolic disk centered at @xmath10 and with radius @xmath2 .",
    "it is a simple computational exercise in complex analysis , that @xmath26 coincides with the euclidean disk @xmath27 where @xmath28    an important feature of the hyperbolic metric within function theory comes from the schwarz - pick lemma which tells us that the holomorphic isometries with respect to @xmath4 ( or @xmath29 ) are exactly the conformal self - mappings of the disk :    [ spl ] let @xmath30 be holomorphic .",
    "then , for every @xmath31 , @xmath32 with equality at a pair @xmath33 , @xmath34 , if and only if @xmath35 for some @xmath9 and @xmath36 .",
    "this is an immediate corollary to the schwarz lemma ( see e.g. @xcite ) by considering the function @xmath37 where for @xmath9 , @xmath38 is the conformal automorphism of @xmath0 interchanging @xmath10 with the origin .",
    "consider now the set of all pseudohyperbolic disks @xmath1 , @xmath39 - 1,1[$ ] , with fixed radius @xmath400,1[$ ] . in studying the boundary behaviour of holomorphic functions in the disk ,",
    "it is of interest to know whether the set @xmath41 - 1,1 [ } d_\\rho(x , r)$ ] belongs to a cone @xmath42 with cusp at @xmath43 and angle @xmath44 such that @xmath45 .",
    "a positive answer is known among specialists in hyperbolic geometry .",
    "we never encountered a proof , though , available for function theorists .",
    "it is the aim of this note to provide such a proof .",
    "for a nice introduction into the function theoretic aspects of the hyperbolic geometry , see @xcite .",
    "here is the assertion we are going to prove .      1 .",
    "the upper boundary @xmath46 of @xmath47 is an arc of the circle @xmath48 the lower boundary is its reflection with respect to the real axis ( see figure [ hyp3 ] ) .",
    "2 .   the tangens of the angle @xmath49 under which @xmath46 cuts the real axis is @xmath50 .",
    "this can be seen by considering the conformal automorphism of the disk given by @xmath56 , by noticing that the image of the disk @xmath57 is the disk @xmath27 and by calculating the images of the boundary points @xmath58 which lie on the half - line passing through @xmath54 and @xmath10 ( see figure [ hyp1 ] ) .",
    "recall that if @xmath3 , then the function @xmath59 , given by @xmath60 , maps the disk @xmath61 onto @xmath1 with @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "since @xmath59 maps @xmath64 $ ] onto @xmath64 $ ] , and since the circle @xmath61 cuts @xmath64 $ ] at a right angle , the angle invariance property of conformal maps implies that @xmath1 is the disk passing through the points @xmath65 and @xmath66 and orthogonal to @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "now we switch to the right half - plane @xmath67 by using the map @xmath68 of @xmath0 onto @xmath67 .",
    "then , by a similar reasoning , @xmath69 is the disk orthogonal to the real axis and passing through the points @xmath70 hence the center @xmath71 of @xmath72 is the arithmetic mean @xmath73 of @xmath74 and @xmath75 , and the radius @xmath76 is @xmath77 .",
    "thus @xmath78 note that if the center @xmath79 of the pseudohyperbolic disk @xmath1 runs through @xmath80 - 1,1[$ ] , then the center @xmath71 of the euclidean disk @xmath81 runs through @xmath800,\\infty[$ ] .",
    "due to conformal invariance , the boundary @xmath82 of @xmath83 coincides with the preimage @xmath84 of the boundary @xmath85 of @xmath86 we show that @xmath87 is the union of the half - line @xmath88 and its reflection @xmath89 , where @xmath49 is the angle whith @xmath90 ( for a first glimpse , see figure [ hyp5 ] ) .    for a fixed @xmath91 - 1,1[$ ] , consider in the first quadrant the tangent @xmath92 to @xmath93 that passes through the origin .",
    "let @xmath94 be its angle with respect to the real axis .",
    "then @xmath95 this is independent of @xmath79 . hence @xmath92 is a joint tangent to all the euclidean disks @xmath93 .",
    "in other words , @xmath96 is contained in the infinite triangle @xmath97 formed by @xmath92 and its reflection . to show that @xmath98 , we need to prove that every point on @xmath92 is the tangent point of some of the disks @xmath99 with @xmath100 . to this end , let @xmath29 be the point on @xmath92 whose distance to @xmath54 is @xmath101 and let @xmath102 be the line orthogonal to @xmath92 and passing through @xmath29",
    ". then @xmath102 cuts the real line at a point @xmath103 .",
    "the unique disk @xmath72 centered at @xmath103 and having @xmath29 as its tangent point to @xmath92 has center @xmath104 and radius @xmath105 , which are given by ( see figure [ hyp6 ] ) @xmath106      by moving back from the right half - plane to the unit disk , we see that @xmath113 is an arc of a circle @xmath114 which passes through @xmath115 and @xmath116 and cuts twice the axis @xmath64 $ ] under the the angle @xmath49 with @xmath117 . using figure [ hyp4 ]",
    ", we then deduce that the radius @xmath118 of @xmath114 coincides with the hipotenusa of the displayed triangle and so @xmath119 this implies that the center @xmath8 of @xmath114 is given by @xmath120      a purely computational proof can be found in ( * ? ? ? * appendix ) . there",
    "it is also shown that the euclidean length of @xmath46 is @xmath124 , and that the surface enclosed by @xmath125 has euclidean measure @xmath126 .",
