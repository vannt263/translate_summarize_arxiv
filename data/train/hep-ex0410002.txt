    "in hadron - hadron scattering , interactions are classified by the characteristics of the final states . in elastic scattering ,",
    "both hadrons emerge unscathed and no other particles are produced . in diffractive dissociation , the energy transfer between the two interacting hadrons remains small , but one ( single dissociation ) or both ( double dissociation ) hadrons dissociate into multi - particle final states , preserving the quantum numbers of the associated initial hadron .",
    "the remaining configurations correspond to inelastic interactions .",
    "the most difficult conceptual aspect of diffractive scattering is to provide a unique and concise definition .",
    "this will not be attempted here and diffraction will be understood as an interaction between projectile and target that generates a large rapidity gap between the respective final states , which is not exponentially suppressed .",
    "diffractive interactions are mediated by the exchange of a colorless object , with quantum numbers of the vacuum .",
    "this definition fits very well the framework of soft interactions , where diffractive scattering is mediated by the exchange of the universal pomeron trajectory ( @xmath0 ) , introduced by gribov  @xcite .",
    "ingelman and schlein  @xcite proposed to use diffractive scattering in the presence of a large scale to establish the partonic content of the pomeron .    in qcd ,",
    "the candidate for vacuum exchange with properties similar to the soft pomeron is two gluon exchange  @xcite . as a result of interactions between the two gluons , a ladder structure develops . in perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , the properties of this ladder depend on the energy and scales involved in the interaction , implying its non - universal character .",
    "each of the approaches mentioned above leads to definite predictions , which can be tested in high energy diffractive interactions in the presence of a hard scale .",
    "this has been pursued in @xmath1 scattering at hera and in @xmath2 scattering at the tevatron .",
    "the purpose of this talk is to summarize the recently achieved progress .",
    "the variables used to analyze diffractive scattering will be introduced for deep inelastic @xmath1 scattering ( dis ) .",
    "since dis is perceived as a two - step process , in which the incoming lepton emits a photon which then interacts with the proton target , the relevant variables can be readily generalized to @xmath2 interactions .     interactions . _ _ ]    a diagram for diffractive scattering in dis , where the diffracted state is separated from the scattered proton by a large rapidity gap ( lrg ) , is presented in figure  [ fig : dis - diag ] and all the relevant four vectors are defined therein .",
    "the usual dis variables are the negative of the mass squared of the virtual photon , @xmath3 , the square of the center of mass energy of the @xmath4 system , @xmath5 , the bjorken scaling variable , @xmath6 , which in the quark parton model constitutes the fraction of the proton momentum carried by the interacting quark , and the inelasticity , @xmath7 .",
    "in addition to the usual dis variables , the variables used to described the diffractive final state are , @xmath8 @xmath9 is the fractional proton momentum which participates in the interaction with @xmath10 .",
    "it is sometimes denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 is the equivalent of bjorken @xmath13 but relative to the exchanged state .",
    "@xmath14 is the invariant mass of the hadronic final state recoiling against the leading proton , @xmath15 .",
    "the approximate relations hold for small values of the four - momentum transfer squared @xmath16 and large @xmath17 , typical of high energy diffraction .",
    "to describe diffractive dis , it is customary to choose the variables @xmath9 and @xmath16 in addition to the usual @xmath13 and @xmath18 in the cross section formula . the diffractive contribution to @xmath19",
    "is denoted by @xmath20 and the corresponding differential contribution , integrated over @xmath16 , is @xmath21 the three - fold differential cross section for @xmath1 scattering can be written as @xmath22   \\sigma_r^{d(3)}(x , q^2,{x_{{{\\scriptscriptstyle { i\\!\\!p } } } } } ) \\ , ,   \\label{eq : f2d4}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 @xmath24 stands for the diffractive longitudinal structure function , which may not be small .",
    "the structure function @xmath19 is related to the absorption cross section of a virtual photon by the proton , @xmath25 . for diffractive scattering , in the limit of high @xmath17 ( low @xmath13 ) ,",
    "@xmath26 this relation allows predictions for diffractive scattering in dis based on regge phenomenology applied to @xmath4 scattering .",
    "in fact many of the questions that are addressed in analyzing diffractive scattering are inspired by regge phenomenology as established in soft hadron - hadron interactions .",
    "the scattering of two hadrons , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , at squared center of mass energy @xmath29 , is described by the exchange of the universal @xmath0 trajectory parameterized as @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath0 trajectory determines the @xmath31 dependence of the total cross section , @xmath32 .",
    "the ratio of elastic and diffractive to total cross sections , is expected to rise like @xmath33 .",
    "a steep and universal @xmath9 dependence of the diffractive cross section is expected , @xmath34 .",
    "values of @xmath35  @xcite and @xmath36  @xcite were derived based on total hadron - proton interaction cross sections and elastic proton - proton data .",
    "recently the @xmath0 intercept has been reevaluated  @xcite leading to a value of @xmath37 .",
    "the positive value of @xmath38 implies that the slope of the @xmath16 distribution is increasing with @xmath39 .",
    "this fact , borne out by the hadron - hadron and photoproduction data ( for a review and new data see  @xcite ) , is known as shrinkage of the @xmath16 distribution .",
    "it is due to the fact that @xmath40 and has been explained by gribov  @xcite as diffusion of particles in the exchange towards low transverse momenta , @xmath41 , with @xmath42 ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "qcd factorization for the diffractive structure function of the proton , @xmath43 , is expected to hold  @xcite , while it can not be proven for hadron - hadron interactions  @xcite .",
    "@xmath43 is decomposed into diffractive parton distributions , @xmath44 , in a way similar to the inclusive @xmath19 , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the universal structure function for dis on parton @xmath47 , @xmath48 is the factorization scale at which @xmath44 are probed and @xmath49 is the fraction of momentum of the proton carried by the diffractive parton @xmath47 .",
    "diffractive partons are to be understood as those which lead to a diffractive final state .",
    "the dglap evolution equation applies in the same way as for the inclusive case . for a fixed value of @xmath9 ,",
    "the evolution in @xmath13 and @xmath18 is equivalent to the evolution in @xmath12 and @xmath18 .",
    "if , following ingelman and schlein  @xcite , one further assumes the validity of regge factorization , @xmath43 may be decomposed into a universal @xmath0 flux and the structure function of the @xmath0 , @xmath50 where the normalization of either of the two components is arbitrary .",
    "it implies that the @xmath9 and @xmath16 dependence of the diffractive cross section is universal , independent of @xmath18 and @xmath12 , and given by @xmath51 one of the expectations which is subject to experimental tests .",
    "the mechanism for producing lrg is assumed to be present at some scale and the evolution formalism allows to probe the underlying partonic structure .",
    "the latter depends on the coupling of quarks and gluons to the pomeron .",
    "at hera the diffractive candidate events are selected either by requiring a large rapidity gap  @xcite , or by requiring a leading proton  @xcite .",
    "the various analyzes differ in the way the non - diffractive contributions are treated and in the way the proton dissociative events are subtracted .",
    "the comparison between the various measurements is shown in figure  [ fig : f2dcomp ] .    the @xmath9 dependence of @xmath52 , in the region of @xmath53 ,",
    "is expected to be dominated by @xmath0 exchange .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath54 are shown as a function of @xmath18 in figure  [ fig : f2dcomp ] .",
    "a dependence of @xmath55 on @xmath18 can not be excluded , however the errors are large enough , so that a constant value of @xmath56 fits the data .",
    "however averaged over the whole @xmath18 range the value of @xmath55 is definitely larger than the intercept of the soft pomeron .",
    "in addition , the diffractive @xmath57 value is only half of that for inclusive @xmath19 measurements , also shown in the figure .",
    "this means that the ratio of diffractive to total @xmath4 cross sections is constant with @xmath17 .",
    "those are indications that the connection of diffractive dis to the simple soft @xmath0 picture is not straight forward .",
    "the h1 measurements of @xmath52  @xcite , which cover by far the largest phase space , have been used to perform a qcd evolution fit to extract diffractive parton distribution functions ( dpdf ) .",
    "the results of the fit are shown in figure  [ fig : dpdf ] .",
    "a very good description of the data is obtained , provided the parton distributions are dominated by gluons , which carry about 80% of the momentum of partons leading to diffractive events .",
    "this latest extraction of dpdfs by h1 is called h1 2002 dpdfs .",
    "qcd factorization can be tested in high transverse momenta , @xmath58 , jet production in @xmath4 , @xmath59 and @xmath2 diffractive production .",
    "if factorization holds , the cross section for production of jets  @xcite and charm  @xcite in @xmath4 should be well reproduced by nlo calculations with dpdfs , extracted from structure function measurements .",
    "this is indeed the case as demonstrated in figure  [ fig : jetscc ] .",
    "qcd factorization breaking is observed in hard diffractive scattering in @xmath2 .",
    "measurements  @xcite of two jet production accompanied by the presence of a leading anti - proton have been used to extract the effective diffractive structure function for two jet production @xmath60 , which can then be compared with the expectations from dpdf extracted at hera .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : fnaljj ] , even for the h1 2002 dpdfs , where the abundance of gluons is lesser compared to earlier dpdfs  @xcite , the expectations are by about a factor 10 above the measurements .",

    "the reggeon contribution is estimated to be of the order of 30 to 40% .",
    "a lesser qcd factorization breaking is observed for diffractive dijet production in @xmath2 events in which both baryons remain unscathed - the so called double pomeron exchange ( dpe ) process  @xcite .",
    "compared to expectations , the rate of dijet production is only by about factor two less abundant .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : fnaljj ] .",

    "this indicates that unitarity effects may already be present in diffractive scattering and may explain why the rise of diffractive scattering cross section with @xmath17 is slower than expected ( see section  [ sec : incl ] ) .",
    "the dynamics behind diffractive dis can be easier understood if the process is viewed in the rest frame of the proton .",
    "the virtual photon develops a partonic fluctuations , whose lifetime is @xmath68  @xcite . at the small @xmath13 typical of hera , where @xmath69 , it is the partonic state rather than the photon that scatters off the proton .",
