    "recent @xmath1cdm , hydrodynamical simulations of the formation of the galaxy ( e.g. zolotov et al .",
    "@xcite ; font et al .",
    "@xcite ; mccarthy et al .",
    "@xcite ) predict the existence of two populations of halo stars .",
    "the first one is formed _ in situ _ in merging and dissipating gas clumps , whereas the other one is _ accreted _ from satellite galaxies . for the upper end of the halo metallicity distribution , zolotov et al .",
    "( @xcite ) find that   in the accreted population decreases with increasing [ fe / h ] relative to the near - constant  in the in - situ population .",
    "this is due to a difference in star formation rate ( sfr ) ; the chemical enrichment proceeds at a slower rate in satellite galaxies , so that type ia sne start contributing with iron at a lower metallicity .",
    "evidence for two halo populations  relative to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) . ] in the solar neighborhood with different  trends has been found by nissen & schuster ( @xcite , hereafter ns10 ) .",

    "the  low - alpha \" stars show a declining -trend from @xmath4dex at @xmath3}}\\simeq -1.6 $ ] to @xmath5dex at @xmath3}}\\simeq -0.8 $ ] , which is the maximum  reached by this population .",
    "furthermore , the toomre diagram shows that the high - alpha stars tend to move on prograde orbits , whereas the low - alpha stars have higher space velocities with respect to the lsr and an excess of retrograde orbits .",
    "these data are consistent with a scenario where the high - alpha stars have been formed in dissipational mergers of gas clouds , and the low - alpha stars have been accreted from satellite galaxies .",
    "the high- and low - alpha halo stars also separate in , , , and , but not in  ( nissen & schuster @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the high - alpha stars seem to be on average 2 - 3gyr older than the low - alpha stars ( schuster et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we report on carbon and oxygen abundances in the two halo populations and compare with abundances in stars having thin- and thick - disk kinematics .",
    "the abundance of carbon was determined from equivalent widths ( ews ) of the high - excitation ci  lines at 5052.2 and 5380.3  as measured in high - resolution , high - s / n vlt / uves and not / fies spectra . for each star",
    ", a 1d model atmosphere was obtained from the marcs grid ( gustafsson et al .",
    "@xcite ) by interpolating to the stellar values of , , , and . the model was used to to derive an lte carbon abundance .",
    "non - lte corrections from takeda & honda ( @xcite ) were afterwards applied , but they are small , i.e. less than 0.02dex .",
    "the atmospheric parameters of the stars were determined spectroscopically by analysing fei  and feii  lines relative to the same lines in the spectra of two nearby thick - disk stars , hd22879 and hd76932 , for which  and are well known from colour indices and hipparcos parallaxes .",
    "this enable us to determine very precise differential parameters and abundances for stars that belong to the same region of the hr - diagram as the standard stars .",
    "the absolute values may be more uncertain .",
    "thus we have increased the  scale by + 100k relative to the scale used in ns10 to take into account the new irfm  colour calibration by casagrande et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "this has only a small effect on ,  ( derived from feii  lines ) , and  ( derived from neutral lines ) , but it has a significant effect on c and o abundances derived from high - excitation atomic lines .",
    "versus [ fe / h ] with the same classification in high- and low - alpha halo and thick - disk stars as in ns10 and with thin - disk stars from nissen ( @xcite ) included.,width=340 ]    the derived  values are shown in fig .",
    "[ nissen : fig1 ] .",
    "in addition to stars from ns10 , we have included stars with thin - disk kinematics from nissen ( @xcite ) , who also used the @xmath6 ci  lines ( measured in high - quality harps spectra ) to derive c abundances .",
    "the error bars shown were estimated by adding , in quadrature , the errors arising from the ews and those corresponding to the internal uncertainties of  and . at low metallicity and low",
    ", the ci  lines are very weak , i.e. @xmath7 2 - 4m  only , so the error of  due to the uncertainty of the ew measurements becomes large .",
    "oxygen abundances were determined from equivalent widths of the @xmath8 oi  triplet lines .",
    "the not / fies spectra do not cover this wavelength region and only a few of the uves spectra have the oi  triplet included .",
    "we have therefore adopted ew measurements from ramrez et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , who derived oxygen abundances for a subset of stars from ns10 using high - resolution spectra obtained with the 2.7 m telescope at the mcdonald observatory , keck / hires , and the mike spectrograph at the magellan telescope . for the thin - disk stars we used feros",
    "spectra obtained with the eso 2.2 m telescope .",
    "altogether , oi  triplet data are available for 101 stars out of the 117 stars for which ci  abundances were determined .    in deriving o abundances from the 7774  triplet , non - lte corrections from fabbian et al .",
    "( @xcite ) were applied as described by nissen ( @xcite ) .",
    "these corrections are important , even for differential determinations in the -range of our sample of stars ; the correction of [ o / h ] ranges from about + 0.1dex at 5300k to @xmath9dex at 6300k .",
    "the derived  values are shown in fig .",
    "[ nissen : fig2 ] .",
    "the distribution of stars looks much the same as that obtained by ramrez et al .",
    "( @xcite , fig .",
    "1 , lower panel ) , except that they find a flatter distribution of [ o / fe ] for the thick - disk and high - alpha halo stars .",
    "this is due to a somewhat stronger dependence of their non - lte corrections on [ fe / h ] than those of fabbian et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "versus [ fe / h].,width=340 ]",
    "as seen from figs . [ nissen : fig1 ] and [ nissen : fig2 ] , the low - alpha halo stars are separated in  and  from thick - disk and high - alpha halo stars . for the latter two populations , the dispersion in  and at a given metallicity can be explained in terms of the errors of the derived abundances , whereas there seems to be an additional cosmic dispersion in  and  for the low - alpha halo population . in support of a real cosmic scatter ,",
    "[ nissen : fig3 ] shows  versus  ( from ns10 ) for the metallicity range @xmath10 } } < -0.7 $ ] , where the largest dispersion is present .",
    "as seen , there is a striking correlation between  and  except for two strongly deviating stars .    as suggested by the @xmath1cdm simulations of zolotov et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , a possible explanation of the abundance differences seen in these figures is that the high - alpha stars were born in the innermost part of the galaxy in a deep gravitational potential with such a high sfr that type ia sne did not contribute significantly with iron until a metallicity of @xmath3}}\\simeq -0.4 $ ] . later these stars were dispersed to the halo by merging satellite galaxies . the low - alpha stars , on the other hand , were formed in dwarf galaxies with a relatively shallow potential , and hence low sfr , so that type ia sne started contributing with iron at a metallicity around or below @xmath3}}= -1.6 $ ] .",
    "the reason for the scattter in , , , and  at a given metallicity could then be that the various satellite galaxies from which the low - alpha stars were accreted had different masses and therefore different star formation rates .      the two deviating low - alpha stars in fig .",
    "[ nissen : fig3 ] , g53 - 41 and g150 - 40 , require a special explanation .",
    "they have high  but low  and also very low .",
    "hence , they share the so - called na - o anti - correlation in second generation stars in globular clusters , which are thought to be made of gas polluted by first - generation agb stars in which the ne - na cycle has occured .",
    "this suggests that some of the halo stars originate from disrupted globular clusters , as also noted by ramrez et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "figures [ nissen : fig1 ] and [ nissen : fig2 ] also give a hint for a difference in  and  between thin- and thick - disk stars in the overlapping metallicity range @xmath11 } } < -0.2 $ ] although we have only two thin - disk stars in this range . a systematic difference",
    "is well established in the case of  ( e.g. bensby & feltzing @xcite , fig .",
    "11b ) and have also been found for the alpha - capture elements , mg , si , ca , and ti ( e.g. adibekyan @xcite , fig . 8) , but it was not seen in the case of  by bensby & feltzing ( @xcite , fig .",
    "11a ) , clearly , we need more thin - disk stars in the overlapping metallicity range to verify the possible difference in  between the thin- and thick - disk populations .    fig .",
    "[ nissen : fig4 ] shows  versus  for the four populations studied in this paper with thin- and thick - disk stars from bensby & feltzing ( @xcite ) included .",
    "their c and o abundances are derived from the weak forbidden @xmath12 [ ci ] and @xmath13 [ oi ] lines but agree very well with our abundances derived from high - excitation ci  and oi  lines .      as seen from fig .",
    "[ nissen : fig4 ] , there is no systematic shift in  between high- and low - alpha halo stars .",
    "this is perhaps surprising , because the time - scale for the chemical enrichment of the low - alpha population is long enough to allow type ia sne to contribute with iron ( our explanation for the low @xmath14/fe ratios ) , and one could therefore have expected that low- and intermediate - mass agb stars had enough time to contribute with carbon and raise  in the low - alpha stars to higher values than in high - alpha stars .",
    "the explanation may be that intermediate - mass ( 4 - 8 @xmath15 ) agb stars contribute very little to @xmath16c ( kobayashi et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and that the evolution time - scale of low - mass ( 1 - 3 @xmath15 ) agb stars ( which do have a high @xmath16c yield according to kobayashi et al . ) is longer than the chemical enrichment time - scale of the low - alpha population .",
    "we conclude that carbon in both high- and low - alpha halo stars was made primarely in high - mass stars ( @xmath17 ) , but with a metallicity - dependent yield to account for the slight increase of  with increasing .        as also seen from fig .",
    "[ nissen : fig4 ] , thick - disk stars have on average the same  as high - alpha halo stars , but thin - disk stars have systematically higher in the overlapping metallicity range @xmath18 } } < + 0.1 $ ] .",
    "this offset in  between thin- and thick - disk stars was already detected by bensby & feltzing ( @xcite , fig .",
    "12 ) , but is even more clearly seen in our fig .",
    "[ nissen : fig4 ] .",
    "probably , the higher  ratios in the galactic thin disk are due to low - mass agb stars , i.e. the chemical enrichment time - scale of the thin disk is long enough to allow low - mass stars to contribute .    as a final remark",
    ", we note that the @xmath6 ci  lines used to derive c abundances in this paper are very weak in metal - poor stars .",
    "thus , very high s / n , high - resolution spectra are required to derive precise c abundances .",
    "the somewhat stronger ci  lines in the 9000 - 9500  region may be used instead ( fabbian et al .",
    "@xcite ) but they are blended by telluric lines . as an interesting alternative one may use the ch band .",
    "[ nissen : fig5 ] shows part of this band in not / fies spectra of a high - alpha star , g31 - 55 ( , , , ) = ( 5738k , 4.33 , @xmath191.10 , 0.29 ) and a low - alpha star hd193901 ( 5756k , 4.39 , @xmath191.09 , 0.16 ) .",
    "as seen , the three fei  lines have similar strengths in the two stars , whereas all ch lines are significantly weaker in the low - alpha star .",
    "hence , it may be possible to use the ch band in large forthcoming surveys such as hermes / galah and eso/4most for high precision differential studies of carbon abundances in stellar populations .",
    "funding for the stellar astrophysics centre is provided by the danish national research foundation ( grant agreement no . : dnrf106 ) .",
