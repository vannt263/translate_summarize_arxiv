    "it has long been known that the lmc contains several clusters that strongly resemble normal globular clusters of the galaxy ( shapley 1930 ) .",
    "several of these objects , however , have turned out to be of intermediate or even young age , in spite of their outward appearance of large size and luminosity .",
    "some years ago one of us , in an attempt to use crude colour - magnitude diagrams , selected 35 clusters that seemed to be old globular clusters ( hodge 1960 ) .",
    "truly old clusters are actually rarer , however ; a recent review of the old populations of the mcs lists only 14 objects that are candidates for clusters that might be as old as the oldest galactic globulars ( olszewski , suntzeff and mateo 1996 ; see also westerlund 1997 ) . however , precise ages are very difficult to determine from the ground , as the main sequence turnoff ( hereafter msto ) occurs at a @xmath0 of approximately 23 , too faint for accurate ground - based photometry in crowded regions of the lmc . for the less crowded outlying clusters",
    "ngc 1466 , ngc 1786 , ngc 1841 , ngc 2210 , ngc 2257 , and reticulum , ground - based cmds approaching and going below the msto have demonstrated that they are quite old ( brocato et al .",
    "1996 ; walker 1990 , 1992a , 1992b ) , with ngc 2257 perhaps being @xmath12 gyr younger than the bulk of milky way clusters ( testa et al .",
    "1995 ) . with uncertainties in age of typically @xmath23 gyr , however , the data are not accurate enough to fully determine whether the clusters are truly as old as the classical galactic globulars or are 2 - 3 gigayears younger , as has been suggested on the basis of their horizontal branch ( hereafter hb ) morphologies ( da costa 1993 ) .",
    "this question is of strong interest both for establishing the timescale of formation of the lmc and for testing age as the candidate second parameter affecting hb morphology , a topic of currently hot debate ( cf .",
    "lee 1992 ; lee , demarque , & zinn 1994 , hereafter ldz ; stetson , vandenberg , & bolte 1996 ; sarajedini , chaboyer , & demarque 1997 ) .",
    "this paper reports on a _ hubble space telescope _",
    "program to determine colour - magnitude diagrams for the six inner globular clusters of the lmc , for which ground - based data would be especially difficult to interpret because of the photometric effects of crowding .",
    "the clusters and their characteristics ( taken from olszewski et al .",
    "1996 ) are listed in table 1 .",
    "these clusters , which presumably formed deep in the lmc gravitational potential well , are excellent probes of the early formation of the main mass of the lmc . in conjunction with the hst study of hodge 11 by mighell et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and the comprehensive study with hst of the outlying old lmc clusters currently underway ( johnson & bolte 1997 ) , our results will be useful for testing models of the formation of the lmc , much as observations of globular clusters in the milky way have evaluated formation models of the galaxy . in the following",
    "we describe the observations in section 2 , detail our reductions in section 3 , discuss field star decontamination in section 4 , and derive the colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) for the clusters in section 5 . in section 6",
    ", we present the ages of the clusters implied by three age - dating techniques : comparison of our cmds with milky way globular cluster fiducial sequences through the  horizontal method \" ( vandenberg , bolte , & stetson 1990 , hereafter vbs ) , measurement of @xmath3 (  vertical method \" ) , and comparison of our hb data with hb evolutionary models from ldz .",
    "these ages are dependent on the adopted abundances , which we measure from the cmds and compare with previously measured spectroscopic abundances ( olszewski et al .",
    "1991 , herafter o91 ) .",
    "we also describe in section 6 our estimates of the reddenings and distances of the clusters .",
    "these estimates are not direct measurements , but rely on knowledge of the reddenings and distances to galactic globular clusters and on an assumed @xmath4(rr)-[fe / h ] relationship .",

    "14a - i , we fit the piece of the fiducial extending from @xmath5 to the cmd points in the same @xmath6 range .",
    "to map the differences in rgb position to age differences between the galactic and lmc clusters , we used a calibration based on the new isochrones of vandenberg ( 1997 ) .",
    "these isochrones are calculated for more than a dozen metallicities in the range @xmath7 [ fe / h ] @xmath8 for ages of 8 - 18 gyr in 2-gyr steps and fit observations of m92 extremely well . after registering the six isochrones of a given metallicity in the @xmath9 plane ,",
    "we fit a piece of the 14 gyr isochrone spanning the range @xmath5 to similar pieces of the other five isochrones . to establish the calibration over a continuum of age differences",
    ", we fit a 2nd order polynomial to the offsets needed to shift this portion of the rgb of the 14 gyr isochrone to the rgbs of the other isochrones .",
    "the choice of the 14 gyr isochrone as the fiducial for this calibration is inconsequential , as the change of @xmath10 colour of the rgb is nearly linear with age for ages between 12 and 18 gyr , the likely age range of old globular clusters .",
    "table 5 lists the polynomial coefficients of the fits to the equation @xmath11 for the range of metallicities considered in this paper . fig .",

    "( 1997 ) . over a range of age differences of @xmath131 gyr ,",
    "our calibration differs by @xmath115 per cent from that of harris et al .",
    "this difference may be attributed to the fact that we used a large portion of the rgb to measure the age differences while harris et al .",
    "( 1997 ) apparently used only the difference in rgb color at @xmath14 . because we can more accurately measure the differences in rgb colors if we use many points on the rgb , we chose to use our calibration over that of harris et al .",
    "however , as the difference in the calibration will only produce differences in the relative age measurements of @xmath150.2 gyr , the choice has little consequence for our results .",

    "the lmc clusters have the same ages as the milky way clusters to within 1.0 @xmath13 1.3 gyr , reinforcing our earlier statement that the lmc old globular clusters are very similar to those in the milky way . in order to examine this global statement on a cluster - to - cluster basis , however , we need to establish the accuracy of the individual relative age measurements .",
    "we did this by performing the relative age measurement on the sets of 100 monte carlo realizations described previously .",
    "for each simulated cmd , we measured @xmath22 and @xmath27 as for the observed cmd and registered the simulated cmd and the error - free input isochrone in the @xmath9 plane .",
    "the simulated measurements of @xmath27 confirm that low completeness affects this measurement , justifying our use of the hb @xmath0 magnitude to perform the vertical registration .",
    "since we do not simulate the hb stars , we assumed that we can correctly perform the vertical registration to within 0.1 @xmath0 magnitudes .",
    "thus , we vertically registered the simulated cmd according to the exact @xmath27 value calculated from the isochrone , but applied a random offset selected from a gaussian with a 1-@xmath28 dispersion of 0.1 magnitudes .",
    "we then measured the age difference between the simulated cmd and the input isochrone as we did for the real clusters . figs .",
    "16a - e show the resulting distributions of age differences and the cumulative distributions of absolute age differences around the mean .",
    "the distributions of age differences are narrow , with 70 per cent of the distributions enclosed within 0.7 - 0.8 gyr of the mean .",
    "however , three of the clusters , ngc 1754 , ngc 2005 , and ngc 2019 , show systematic biases towards recovering ages @xmath11 gyr younger than the age of the input isochrone , while ngc 1835 has a bias towards recovering ages @xmath10.5 gyr younger than the input .",
    "these biases are likely due to the crowding errors in the photometry illustrated by the example of fig .",
    "although ignoring the biases would not significantly affect our results , we have corrected for them in the relative age measurements reported in table 6 .      to measure @xmath3 we used the values of @xmath21 measured in section 6.2.1 and the magnitude of the msto ( @xmath29 ) implied by the polynomial fit to the points near the turnoff .",
    "because the msto region is nearly vertical in the cmd and the measurement of @xmath21 is subject to some interpretation , the error in @xmath3 may be larger than reported here .",

    "an advantage of using this relation is that we can easily compare the ages we derive from @xmath3 with those of the galactic globular clusters .",
    "as has been noted , however , this relation disagrees strongly with the distance to the lmc implied by the first _",
    "cepheid work ( feast & catchpole 1997 ) , but not with the recent _ hipparcos _ cepheid analysis of madore & freedman ( 1998 ) . the @xmath3 ages we measure are listed in table 6 , for both the o91 and cmd - based abundances .",
    "an interesting question is whether the lmc clusters show a variation of hb morphology with metallicity similar to the milky way clusters .",
    "we measured the hb morphology of our clusters through the commonly used ( b - r)/(b+v+r ) index , where b is the number of stars to the blue of the instability strip , r the number of stars to the red of the instability strip , and v the number rr lyrae variables . because we do not have sufficient time resolution in our images to identify rr lyrae variables from their light curves , we rely on the approximate location of the instability strip in the cmd plane to determine the boundaries of the b , v , and r zones .",
    "our chosen boundaries are @xmath10=0.23 for the blue edge of the instability strip and @xmath10=0.57 for the red edge .",

    "we show separate plots for the o91 spectroscopic abundances and the cmd - based abundances . depending on which set of abundance measurements is adopted , we arrive at slightly different conclusions . if we choose to adopt the spectroscopic abundances , we conclude that , based on the hb morphologies , our lmc clusters are similar to the  younger halo \" of the milky way . on the other hand ,",
    "if we adopt the cmd - based abundances , we find that the lmc clusters are similar to the oldest milky way globulars , with ngc 1835 perhaps being @xmath12 gyr younger .",
    "as we are more confident in the cmd - based abundances , the hb models suggest that the lmc is as old as the milky way .",
    "independent of the abundances used , all of the clusters , with the possible exception of ngc 1835 , fall on the same hb evolutionary sequence .",
    "the similarity in age of the clusters implied by the hb sequences agrees with the narrow age spread implied by both the comparison with milky way fiducials and the measurements of @xmath3 .",
    "it is also interesting to note that none of the lmc clusters studied here bears similarity to ruprecht 106 or pal 12 , which have been suggested to be captures from the magellanic clouds ( lin & richer 1992 ; cf .",

    "we estimated the reddenings of the clusters in two ways .",
    "first , the horizontal shifts needed to register our cmds with the the milky way fiducials yields the reddening difference between the lmc clusters and the milky way comparison clusters . as the reddenings of the milky way clusters is well known",
    ", we can calculate the reddenings of the lmc clusters .",
    "second , as previously discussed , we use the s94 method to measure the reddening from @xmath33 , the colour of the giant branch at the level of the hb .",
    "table 6 contains our measurements of @xmath34 as well as the estimates of suntzeff et al .",
    "for the milky way comparison method , we report separate values for the two possible abundance systems . in all calculations , we have used @xmath35 ( dean , warren , & cousins 1978 ) . as the dispersion in the measurements is small ,",
    "we adopt for the @xmath34 of each cluster the average of our measurements , also listed in table 6 .",
    "our cmds are not sufficiently deep to accurately measure the distances to the clusters directly from a fit to the unevolved main sequence .",
    "however , we can use the vertical shifts measured in section 6.2.3 to measure the distances to the lmc clusters based on adopted distances to the milky way comparison clusters .",
    "in addition , by adopting an @xmath36}$ ] relation , we can measure the distances to the lmc clusters from @xmath21 . by demanding that the distances measured with our data should be consistent with those implied by observations of lmc field rr lyrae",
    ", we can use the distance measurements to check the internal consistency of our measurements of the reddenings and abundances , in addition to establishing the relative distances between the clusters . for our calculations ,",
    "we adopt distances to m3 , m5 , and m55 that are consistent with the lmc modulus of 18.5 used in walker s ( 1992c ) analysis of the zero point of the @xmath30[fe / h ] relation ; we use the preferred @xmath36}$ ] relation of chaboyer et al .",

    "1991 , sonneborn et al . 1997 ) , the exact distance is irrelevant for the consideration of the _ internal _ consistency of our measurements .",
    "18 shows our distance modulus measurements for both the milky way comparison and @xmath21 methods and for both the o91 and cmd - based abundance sources .",

    "we have subtracted an lmc distance modulus of 18.5 from the left panels and 18.37 from the right panels .",
    "while the errors are large , the plots suggest that the cmd - based abundances produce a greater consistency between the cluster distances and the lmc modulus .",
    "all of the distances , with the possible exception of ngc 1754 , appear consistent with lying in the plane of the lmc .",
    "the main results of our analysis are that the six old lmc globular clusters ngc 1754 , ngc 1835 , ngc 1898 , ngc 1916 , ngc 2005 , and ngc 2019 are clearly very similar in age , abundance , and hb morphology to the globular clusters of the milky way halo . excluding ngc 1916 from the bulk of the analysis because of the difficulty of treating its differential reddening , we have explored the similarity in age through the use of three age - dating techniques : comparison of our cmds with milky way globular cluster fiducial sequences through the  horizontal method \" ( vbs ) , measurement of @xmath3 (  vertical method \" ) , and comparison of our hb data with hb evolutionary models from ldz . while showing the clear similarity in age with milky way globular clusters , each of these techniques additionally suggest that we detect no internal age spread in this set of lmc globular clusters .",
    "we have measured the abundances of the clusters from the slope of the rgb ( s94 ) .",
    "while the mean abundance that we derive is higher than that measured by o91 , it is not grossly different .",
    "we have argued , however , that the cmd - based abundances should be considered more reliable .    throughout our analysis , we have tried to be as careful as possible in identifying and measuring errors . in particular , we have extensively used monte carlo simulations to model both systematic and random errors in our measurements . although we were unable to independently check the holtzman ( 1995b ) zero points to a precision of @xmath380.1 magnitudes through our ground - based photometry , our measurements of the abundances and relative ages",
    "are differential , and so should not be affected by errors in the zero points .",
    "the reddenings and distance moduli that we derive , however , _ are _ subject to unkown zero point errors in the photometry .    adopting the cmd - based abundances , the possibility that the old lmc globular clusters are younger than the oldest milky way globular clusters by 2 - 3 gyr ( da costa 1993 ) appears not to be the case for the clusters studied here .",
    "this result is clear from the relative ages derived from the comparison of the clusters with milky way fiducials , the results of which are shown in table 6 .",
    "ngc 1754 , ngc 1898 , ngc 2005 , and ngc 2019 , which we find have abundances most closely matching that of the classical old galactic globular cluster m5 , are all of similar age or older than m5 .",
    "ngc 1835 , which we find has an abundance similar to m3 , is @xmath12 gyr older .",
    "as ldz consider m3 to be @xmath12 gyr younger than the oldest halo clusters , ngc 1835 appears to have an age similar to the oldest milky way clusters .",
    "interpreting our data through the hb models of ldz , we paint a similar picture . as shown in fig .",
    "17a , the clusters ngc 1754 , ngc 1898 , ngc 2005 , and ngc 2019 all fall on the hb evolutionary track crossing through the oldest milky way halo clusters . comparing our data with the hb data of walker ( 1992b ) for the outer lmc old globular clusters , we find that the hb models suggest that the earliest episode of cluster formation in the lmc spanned 2 - 3 gyr . however , we find some problems with the ages implied by the hb models .",
    "the age of ngc 1835 suggested by the hb models is inconsistent with its age relative to m3 .",
    "in addition , the age of ngc 1754 relative to m5 is slightly older than suggested by the hb models .",
    "these inconsistencies may indicate a difficulty with the interpretation that metallicity and age are the only parameters affecting hb morphology , as has been suggested by many authors ( e.g. buonanno et al .",
    "1997 , catelan et al .",

    "given the currently large errors in the abundance measurements , however , we do not claim on the basis of our data that this interpretation needs to be modified .",
    "the ages we derive from @xmath3 are marginally consistent with the picture that the lmc clusters studied here are as old as the oldest milky way clusters .",
    "our measured values of @xmath3 imply an average age of 15.3 @xmath13 1.5 gyr , which is lower but within @xmath39 of the average age of the old halo quoted by chaboyer et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , 17.8 @xmath13 0.4 gyr .    because of the metallicity dependence of the age indicators discussed in section 6.2 , our conclusions based on the cluster ages depend critically on the cmd - based abundances being correct .",
    "if we adopt the o91 spectroscopic abundances , for instance , our conclusions change considerably .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "17b shows the comparison of the ldz hb evolutionary tracks with our cluster data using the o91 abundances .",
    "the hb tracks imply , in this case , that the lmc clusters are indeed @xmath12 gyr younger than the old milky way halo . however , we are then unable to build a consistent picture with the relative ages derived from the comparison to milky way clusters .",
    "coupled with the better internal consistency weakly implied by the distance moduli ( figs .",
    "18a - d ) , we continue to prefer the cmd - based abundances for these lmc clusters .",
    "nevertheless , it would clearly be extremely valuable to have high - resolution spectroscopic abundances of several stars in each cluster available .",
    "in contrast to the globular clusters of the milky way halo , the old lmc clusters are not as clearly part of a distinct halo ( o91 ; schommer et al .",
    "our results imply that at the time the milky way formed its first globular clusters , the lmc may have already collapsed to a disk and started forming clusters .",
    "why there appears to be no clear halo component in the lmc ( olszewski , suntzeff , & mateo 1996 ) remains an open question .",
    "however , by establishing that the oldest clusters in the lmc are truly as old as the milky way galaxy , we have taken an important step towards understanding the formation of the lmc .",

    "<S> we report on hst observations of six candidate old globular clusters in the large magellanic cloud : ngc 1754 , ngc 1835 , ngc 1898 , ngc 1916 , ngc 2005 and ngc 2019 . </S>",
    "<S> deep exposures with the f555w and f814w filters provide us with colour - magnitude diagrams that reach to an apparent magnitude in @xmath0 of @xmath125 , well below the main sequence turnoff . </S>",
    "<S> these particular clusters are involved with significantly high lmc field star densities and care was taken to subtract the field stars from the cluster colour - magnitude diagrams accurately . in two cases there is significant variable reddening across at least part of the image , but only for ngc 1916 does the differential reddening preclude accurate measurements of the cmd characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> the morphologies of the colour - magnitude diagrams match well those of galactic globular clusters of similar metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> all six have well - developed horizontal branches , while four clearly have stars on both sides of the rr lyrae gap . </S>",
    "<S> the abundances obtained from measurements of the height of the red giant branch above the level of the horizontal branch are 0.3 dex higher , on average , than previously measured spectroscopic abundances . </S>",
    "<S> detailed comparisons with galactic globular cluster fiducials show that all six clusters are old objects , very similar in age to classical galactic globulars such as m5 , with little age spread among the clusters . </S>",
    "<S> this result is consistent with ages derived by measuring the magnitude difference between the horizontal branch and main sequence turnoff . </S>",
    "<S> we also find a similar chronology by comparing the horizontal branch morphologies and abundances with the horizontal branch evolutionary tracks of lee , demarque , & zinn ( 1994 ) . </S>",
