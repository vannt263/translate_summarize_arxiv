    "noiseless index coding problem was first introduced by birk and kol @xcite as an informed source coding problem over a broadcast channel .",
    "it involves a single source @xmath1 that wishes to send @xmath2 messages from a set @xmath3 to a set of @xmath4 receivers @xmath5 .",
    "the messages @xmath6 belong to the finite field @xmath7 .",
    "a receiver @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 is identified by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the set of messages demanded by the receiver @xmath8 and @xmath13 is the set of messages known to the receiver @xmath8 a priori .",
    "the index coding problem can be specified by @xmath14 .",
    "an index code for the index coding problem @xmath14 consists of + @xmath15an encoding function @xmath16 + @xmath17a set of decoding functions @xmath18 such that , for a given input @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "the optimal index code as defined in @xcite is that index code which minimizes @xmath21 , the number of binary transmissions .",
    "an index code is said to be @xmath22 if its encoding function is linear and @xmath23 @xmath24 if all its decoding functions are linear @xcite .",
    "further , @xcite establishes that for the class of index coding problems which can be represented using side information graphs , which were labeled later in @xcite as @xmath25 @xmath26 index coding problems , the length of optimal linear index code is equal to the @xmath27 over @xmath7 of the corresponding side information graph .",
    "this is extended in @xcite to a general instance of index coding problem using minrank over @xmath28 of the corresponding side information hypergraph .    in both @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "noiseless binary channels are considered and hence the problem of index coding is formulated as a scheme to reduce the number of binary transmissions .",
    "this amounts to minimum bandwidth consumption , with binary transmission .",
    "we consider noisy index coding problems .",
    "we can reduce bandwidth further by using some m - ary modulation scheme .",
    "hence we consider awgn broadcast channel .",
    "a previous work which considered index codes over gaussian broadcast channel is by l.natarajan et al.@xcite .",
    "index codes based on multi - dimensional qam constellations were proposed and a metric called @xmath29 was introduced as a measure of efficiency with which the index codes utilizes receiver side information .",
    "however @xcite does not consider the index coding problem as originally defined in @xcite and @xcite as it does not minimize the number of transmissions .",
    "it always use @xmath30-point signal sets , where as we use signal sets of smaller sizes as well along with @xmath31point signal sets for the same index coding problem .",
    "we consider index coding problems over awgn broadcast channels .",
    "we find the length of the optimal linear index code of the given index coding problem by determining the minrank over @xmath7 of the corresponding side information hypergraph , whenever possible , by brute force .",
    "otherwise we use linear index codes of any length .",
    "let the length of the index code be @xmath32 .",
    "so a given input @xmath33 will result in a codeword @xmath34 .",
    "instead of using @xmath32 binary transmissions to broadcast the codeword @xmath35 as is done in noiseless index coding , we map the @xmath32-bit codeword to a @xmath36psk symbol with symbol energy equal to the total energy of the @xmath32 binary transmissions . by doing this ,",
    "we get further gain in bandwidth , which we call the * psk bandwidth gain*. in this paper , we propose an algorithm to map index coded bits into psk symbols so that the receiver with maximum amount of side information gains in probability of error performance , followed by the receiver with next highest amount of side information and so on , which we term as the * psk side  information  coding  gain*(psk - sicg ) . we show that there is a fundamental limit on the amount of side information a receiver should have so as to get psk - sicg and that this limit is also influenced by the linear index code that we choose . also , we show that receivers with large amount of side information obtain this coding gain in addition to the bandwidth gain whereas receivers with lesser amount of side information trade off this coding gain with bandwidth gain .",
    "moreover , in general , the difference between the best and worst performance among the receivers is shown to be proportional to the length of the index code employed .",
    "exceptions to this general result are possible and example [ ex5 ] is an instance .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "model ] , the index coding problem setting that we consider is formally defined with examples .",
    "the term psk - sicg is formally defined .",
    "the fundamental limit on the amount of side information a receiver should have and its relation to the chosen index code in order to get psk - sicg is also discussed . in section [ sec : algo ] , we give an algorithm to map the index coded bits to a @xmath36psk symbol such that the receiver with maximum amount of side information sees maximum psk - sicg .",
    "we go on to give examples with simulation results to support our claims in the subsequent section [ sec : simu ] .",
    "finally the results are summarized in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "a general index coding problem can be converted into one where each receiver demands exactly one message , i.e.,@xmath37 . a receiver which demands more than one message ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath38 , can be considered as @xmath39 equivalent receivers all having the same side information set @xmath40 and demanding a single message each .",
    "since the same message can be demanded by multiple receivers , this gives @xmath41 .",

    "if for a particular index coding problem , the minrank over @xmath7 of the corresponding side information hypergraph is @xmath32 , then , instead of transmitting @xmath32 bpsk symbols we will transmit a single point from a @xmath58-psk signal set with the energy of the @xmath58-psk symbol being equal to @xmath32 times the energy of a bpsk symbol , i.e. , equal to the total transmitted energy of the @xmath32 bpsk symbols .",
    "this scheme will give bandwidth gain in addition to the gain in bandwidth obtained by going from @xmath2 to @xmath32 bpsk transmissions utilizing side information .",
    "this extra gain is termed as psk bandwidth gain .",
    "the term * psk bandwidth gain * is defined as the factor by which the bandwidth required to transmit the index code is reduced , obtained while transmitting a @xmath58-psk signal point instead of transmitting @xmath32 bpsk signal points .    for an index coding problem",
    ", there will be a reduction in required bandwidth by a factor of @xmath59 , which will be obtained by all receivers .    with proper mapping of the index coded bits to psk symbols , the algorithm for which is given in section [ sec : algo ] , we will see that receivers with more amount of side information will get better performance in terms of probability of error , provided the side information available satisfies certain properties .",
    "this gain in error performance , which is solely due to the effective utilization of available side information by the proposed mapping scheme , is termed as psk - sicg .",
    "further , by sending the index coded bits as a @xmath36-psk signal point , if a receiver gains in probability of error performance relative to a receiver in the n - fold bpsk transmission scheme , we say that the receiver gets psk absolute coding gain(psk - acg ) .",
    "the term * psk side information coding gain * is defined as the coding gain a receiver with side information gets relative to one with no side information , when the index code is transmitted as a signal point in a @xmath58-psk .",
    "the term * psk absolute coding gain * is defined as the gain in probability of error performance obtained by any receiver in the @xmath36-psk signal transmission scheme relative to its performance in n - fold bpsk transmission scheme .",
    "for each of the receivers @xmath60 , define the set @xmath61 to be the set of all binary transmissions which @xmath8 knows a priori , i.e. , @xmath62 .",
    "for example , in example [ ex1 ] , @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 and @xmath67    a receiver , @xmath8 will get psk - sicg only if its available side information satisfies at least one of the following two conditions .",
    "@xmath68    the condition ( 2 ) above indicates how the psk side information coding gain is influenced by the linear index code chosen .",
    "different index codes for the same index coding problem will give different values of @xmath69 and hence leading to possibly different psk side information coding gains .    consider the receiver @xmath70 in example [ ex1 ] .",
    "it satisfies both the conditions with @xmath71 and @xmath72 . for a particular message realization @xmath73",
    ", the only index coded bit @xmath70 does not know a priori is @xmath74 .",
    "hence there are only 2 possibilities for the received codeword at the receiver @xmath70 .",
    "hence it needs to decode to one of these 2 codewords , not to one of the 16 codewords that are possible had it not known any of @xmath75 a priori .",
    "then we say that @xmath70 sees an effective codebook of size 2 .",
    "this reduction in the size of the effective codebook seen by the receiver @xmath70 is due to the presence of side information that satisfied condition ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) above .    for a receiver to see an effective codebook of size @xmath76",
    ", it is not necessary that the available side information should satisfy both the conditions .",
    "if at least one of the two conditions is satisfied , then that receiver will see an effective codebook of reduced size and hence will get psk - sicg by proper mapping of index coded bits to @xmath36-psk symbols . this can be seen from the following example .",

    "however , it will still see an effective codebook of size 8 , since @xmath82 , and hence will get psk - sicg by proper mapping of the codewords to 16-psk signal points .        . ]",
    "in this section we present the algorithm for labelling the appropriate sized psk signal set .",
    "let the minimum number of binary transmissions required @xmath83 minrank over @xmath84 and the @xmath32 transmissions are labeled @xmath85 , where each of @xmath86 is a linear combination of @xmath87 . if the minrank is not known then @xmath32 can be taken to be the length of any known linear index code .",
    "let @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the encoding matrix corresponding to the linear index code chosen . since @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "we have to consider the two conditions given by ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) listed in section [ sec : model ] .",
    "let @xmath92 .",
    "the two conditions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are equivalent to the condition @xmath93 .",

    "wlog , let @xmath95 be such that @xmath96    let @xmath97 and @xmath98 @xmath99 @xmath100 , @xmath101",
    ". for any given realization of @xmath102 , the effective signal set seen by the receiver @xmath103 consists of @xmath104 points . hence if @xmath105 , then @xmath106 the minimum distance of the signal set seen by the receiver @xmath103 , @xmath107 , will not increase .",
    "@xmath108 will remain equal to the minimum distance of the corresponding @xmath58 psk .",

    "@xmath110 * goto * step 3 *    note that the algorithm [ algo1 ] above does not result in a unique mapping of index coded bits to @xmath36-psk symbols .",
    "the mapping will change depending on the choice of @xmath102 in each step .",
    "however , the performance of all the receivers obtained using any such mapping scheme resulting from the algorithm will be the same .",
    "further , if @xmath124 for some @xmath125 , depending on the ordering of @xmath126 done before starting the algorithm , @xmath103 and @xmath127 may give different performances in terms of probability of error .",
    "consider the index coding problem in example [ ex1 ] in section [ sec : model ] .",
    "here , @xmath128 and @xmath129 . running the algorithm [ algo1 ] in section [ sec : algo ] , suppose we fix @xmath130 , we get @xmath131 . these codewords are mapped to diametrically opposite 16-psk symbols as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "then , @xmath132 , which results in maximum overlap with @xmath133 , is @xmath134 .",
    "we consider @xmath135 and map it to a signal point such that these three codewords are at the best possible minimum distance .",
    "now we go back to step 3 with @xmath136 and find @xmath137 which has maximum overlap with the mapped codewords . now",
    ". then we map @xmath139 which is not already mapped , to a psk signal point such that @xmath138 has the maximum possible minimum distance .",
    "this will result in the mapping as shown in fig . [",
    "fig1](b ) .",
    "continuing in this manner , we finally end up with the mapping shown in fig . [",
    "fig1](c ) .",
    "we see that for such a mapping the @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "simulation results for the above example is shown in fig .",
    "we see that the probability of message error plots corresponding to @xmath142 is well to the left of the plots of @xmath143 and @xmath144 , which themselves are far to the left of other receivers as @xmath145 get psk - sicg as defined in section [ sec : model ] . since @xmath146 gets the highest psk - sicg .",
    "further , since @xmath147 and @xmath148 does not satisfy any of the two conditions required , they do not get psk - sicg . the performance improvement gained by @xmath149 and @xmath150 over n - fold bpsk index code transmission can also be observed .    from the probability of message error plot , though it would seem that the receivers @xmath151 and @xmath152 lose out in probability of message error performance to the n - fold bpsk scheme , they are merely trading off coding gain for bandwidth gain as where the n - fold bpsk scheme for this example uses 4 real dimensions , the proposed scheme only uses 1 complex dimension , i.e. , 2 real dimensions .",
    "hence the receivers @xmath153 and @xmath152 get psk bandwidth gain even though they do not get psk - acg whereas @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 get both psk bandwidth gain and psk - acg .",
    "the amount of psk - sicg , psk bandwidth gain and psk - acg that each receiver gets is summarized in table [ table1 ] .    .",

    "[ fig12 ] . from fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] , we can see that the gap between @xmath70 and @xmath154 widens monotonically as we move from @xmath32 to @xmath2 .",
    "however the best performing receiver s , i.e. , @xmath70 s performance improves as we go from @xmath32 to @xmath2 .",
    "the minimum distance seen by different receivers for the 3 cases considered , namely , 8-psk , 16-psk and 32-psk , are listed in table [ table7 ] .",
    "the mapping and 2-d transmission scheme proposed in this paper is applicable to any index coding problem setting . in a practical scenario , we can use this mapping scheme to prioritize those customers who are willing to pay more , provided their side information satisfies the condition mentioned in section [ sec : model ] .",
    "further , the mapping scheme depends on the index code , i.e. , the encoding matrix , @xmath89 , chosen , since @xmath89 determines @xmath155 .",
    "so we can even choose an @xmath89 matrix such that it favors our chosen customer , provided @xmath89 satisfies the condition that all users use the minimum possible number of binary transmissions to decode their required messages .",
