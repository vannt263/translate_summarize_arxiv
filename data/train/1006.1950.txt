    "[ probability ] we show how the probability of the largest cluster varies with non - gausianity and @xmath45 .    as would be expected , large non - gaussianity and large @xmath45 lead to larger most massive clusters being more probable ( desjacques et al .",
    "2009 , desjacques & seljak 2010 , sartoris et al .",
    "this means that too much non - gaussinity or too high a value of @xmath45 is also disfavored as then the most massive cluster is more likely to be even larger than xmm2235 .",

    "( 2008 ) who found a good fit ( for flat cosmologies ) was given by setting @xmath61 and @xmath62 in eq .",
    "[ zf ] and setting @xmath63 the primary dependence of @xmath64 on the cosmological parameters is due to the dependence of @xmath65 in eq .",
    "[ zf ] on @xmath45 . for our parameter choices",
    "we find that @xmath66 and so the wmap7+bao+h0 prior we use for @xmath45 ( standard deviation of 0.024 ) leads to an uncertainty of in @xmath64 of about 0.048 . additionally , the gao et al .  (",
    "2008 ) simulations are based on a @xmath67 cosmology , while the wmap7+bao+h0 prior we use has a mean of 0.809 .",
    "this leads to an error of 0.2 in @xmath64 .",
    "however , this is negligible compared to the n - body fitting error for @xmath64 of 0.75 used by jee et al .",
    "( 2009 ) to estimate the mass error of xmm2235 .",
    "so , within the tight constraints of wmap7+bao+h0 we can neglect the dependence of @xmath64 on the cosmological parameters .",
    "hence our likelihood for xmm2235 alone will not be strictly correct outside the ranges of the wmap7+bao+h0 prior that we use .",
    "however , this will not affect our final constraints as they will be based on the posterior probability which includes the wmap7+bao+h0 prior .",
    "another systematic that should be considered is the effect of contributions from the triaxial shapes of cluster - sized halos and uncorrelated large - scale matter projections along the line - of - sight .",
    "this generally leads to an additional mass error of about 20% ( becker and kravtsov ( 2010 ) ) . to account for this we added this error in quadrature to the error quoted by jee et al .",
    "this widened our central bin width from 2.4 to @xmath68 .",
    "we found this increased bin width had a negligible impact on our results .",
    "we generated a grid of probabilities in @xmath45 and @xmath4 for the xmm2235 being the maximum mass cluster .",
    "we then interpolated this grid to get our likelihood function , @xmath69 , which is plotted in fig .",
    "[ likelihood ] .    as can be seen",
    "there is a strong degeneracy between @xmath4 and @xmath45 as expected from fig .",
    "[ probability ] and the above discussion .",
    "the wmap7 data constrains the local non - gaussianity parameter to @xmath70 at the @xmath71 cl ( komatsu et al .",
    "2010 ) . but",
    "this non - gaussianity constraint is at wave - numbers of about @xmath72  mpc@xmath73 ( komatsu & spergel 2010 , loverde et al .",
    "2008 , sefusatti et al .",
    "non - gaussianity has also been constrained to similar levels and scales as wmap7 by halo bias ( slosar et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the non - gaussianity enhancement , @xmath74 depends on @xmath75 only through its effect on the skewness of the smoothed density field ( matarrese et al .",
    "the skewness depends on an integral over two wave numbers , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , and the angle between them .",
    "we integrate over the angle and plot the kernel in fig .",
    "[ kernel ] for the density field smoothed on scales corresponding to the mass of xmm2235 .",
    "as can be seen the mean of the kernel is at around @xmath78 mpc@xmath73 .",
    "also the amplitude of the kernel remain non - negligable up to about @xmath79 mpc@xmath73 .",
    "therefore , the xmm2235 measurement probes smaller length scales than the wmap7 measurement of @xmath75",
    ". there are multi - field models which produce a scale dependent @xmath75 with the spectral index generally being first order in the slow roll parameters , but larger values are possible ( see for example , byrnes et al .",
    "also , there are models which produce a step - function like change in @xmath75 ( riotto and sloth , 2010 ) , so @xmath75 can be small on wmap7 scales but large on cluster scales .    the wmap7 data ( larson et al 2010 ) constrains @xmath45 and the other 5 cosmological parameters ( @xmath80 ) of the flat @xmath0cdm model to very high precision .",
    "even tighter constraints are obtained when wmap7 is combined with baryon oscillation ( bao ) and hubble expansion data ( h0 ) ( komatsu et al . 2010 ) .",
    "the marginalized distributions of the 6 parameters are very close to gaussian with small degeneracies between the parameters . also , as the constraint on @xmath45 is much tighter than the one obtainable from xmm2235 , we can approximate the wmap7+bao+h0 as a gaussian prior on @xmath45 with mean of 0.809 and a standard deviation of 0.024 .",
    "the posterior for @xmath4 and @xmath45 is obtained by multiplying the likelihood and prior .",
    "the 95% confidence interval contours are plotted in fig .",
    "[ posterior ] .    as can be seen by comparing fig .",
    "[ likelihood ] with fig .",
    "[ posterior ] , there is some tension between the higher values of @xmath45 preferred by xmm2235 and those favoured by wmap7 even when a non - zero @xmath4 is allowed .",
    "it can also be seen that wmap7 completely breaks the degeneracy between @xmath45 and @xmath4 .",
    "the marginalized posterior probability density function function for @xmath4 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ marginalized ] .",
    "we found that the marginalized probability that @xmath81 was 94% , the mean of @xmath4 was 529 and the standard deviation 194 .",
    "we can combine the wmap7 constraint @xmath82 ( komatsu et al .",
    "2010 ) at wave - numbers of about 0.04  mpc@xmath73 to the one obtained here @xmath83 at wave - numbers of about 0.1  mpc@xmath73 to constrain the non - gaussian spectral index , defined by @xmath84 in order to use eq .",
    "[ nng ] , we have to assume that @xmath4 is the same sign on all scales .",
    "using the cmb and cluster mean constraints on @xmath4 implies @xmath85 which is quite high as it is generally first order in the slow roll parameters , but larger values are possible ( byrnes et al .",
    "alternatively , such a rapid change in @xmath75 could be explained by models that produce a step - function like change in @xmath75 ( riotto and sloth , 2010 ) .",
    "we found constraints of @xmath86 at wave - numbers of about 0.1 mpc@xmath73 using the observations of cluster xmm2235 .",
    "we found @xmath87xmm2235@xmath88 and so xmm2235 is consistent with @xmath89 .",
    "the wmap7 data was used to break the degeneracy with @xmath45 . in order to do the analysis",
    ", we assumed xmm2235 was the most massive cluster of the survey .",
    "if this turns out not to be the case , our results will be conservative as a larger cluster mass would imply more preference for a higher value of @xmath4 .    as done in jee et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , we based our analysis on the @xmath0cdm jenkins et al .",
    "( 2001 ) mass function fitted for the 324 overdensity halo definition .",
    "we also tried several other mass functions .",
    "the mass of xmm2235 can be evaluated for other overdensities by assuming a nfw profile ( hu & kravtsov 2003 ) . we found similar results for the 180 overdensity mass functions of jenkins et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and sheth & tormen ( 1999 ) .",
    "it is a concern that in general the mass functions need to be extrapolated to some extent for the very high masses we are considering .",
    "this is partly due to the rareness of such massive halos in the @xmath89 case",
    ". it would be useful if this range could be mapped out better by a large number of low resolution n - body simulations .",
    "our results are based on the assumption , that matarrese et al .",
    "( 2000 ) approach for accounting for the enhancement of cluster numbers is valid up to @xmath90 , which should be tested against n - body simulations .",
    "recent work ( enqvist et al .  2010 ) has shown that the high @xmath4 cutoff in our marginalized distribution posterior distribution of @xmath4 may be too drastic .",
    "this would imply that our results are conservative and that our mean @xmath4 is higher .    also , selection effects could reduce the significance of our result in that rather than using the 11 deg@xmath3 one should take the sky area of all surveys which have sufficient depth to see clusters at @xmath91 .",
    "for example if we take the the hoyle et al ( 2010 ) compilation of high-@xmath55 x - ray cluster surveys which covers an area of about 300 square degrees that would reduce our value of @xmath87xmm2235@xmath92 to about 15% although some of those surveys do not have good completeness for such a high redshift .",
    "taking into account sunyaev - zeldovich surveys may reduce the significance further depending on whether they have sufficient depth to have seen clusters at @xmath93 .",
    "additionally one could use a larger range of observed high - z clusters to constrain @xmath4 .",
    "but a fuller analysis may require a detailed study using the selection functions of all current cluster surveys , so we leave this for future work .",
    "there are several other mechanisms , that could lead to unusually high mass clusters , such as features in the primordial power spectrum ( chantavat et al . 2008 ) , or modifications in the growth function due to dynamical dark energy or non - einstein gravity .",
    "our results are consistent with @xmath89 but the allowed range of @xmath4 is quite high .",
    "if our central values turn out to be correct , then future observations should be able to detect the non - gaussianity and its running ( loverde et al .",
