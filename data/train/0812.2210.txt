    "as is well known , the popular vacuum - cold dark matter ( @xmath0cdm ) model fits rather well most observational data , however it suffers from two main -and lasting- shortcomings , namely : the low value of the vacuum energy ( about 123 magnitude orders below the quantum field theory estimation ) and the coincidence problem .",
    "the latter refers to the fact that despite the vacuum energy does not vary with time and dark matter energy depends on redshift as @xmath1 both energy densities are nowadays of the same order .",
    "this is why very often the vacuum component is replaced by an evolving dark energy field -see @xcite for recent reviews .",
    "nevertheless , this does not satisfactorily solve the problem since the initial value of the dark energy ought to be fine tuned up to obtain the desired result ; it only substitutes a fine tuning by another @xcite .",
    "an encouraging approach that is receiving increasing attention @xcite rests on the assumption that both components do not evolve separately but interact with each other , i.e. , @xmath2 here , @xmath3 stands for the interaction term , and the subscripts @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote non - relativistic ( pressureless ) dark matter ( dm ) and dark energy ( de ) , respectively .",
    "clearly , this represents a step forward because for @xmath6 ( i.e. , for energy transfers from de to dm ) the ratio between both energies , @xmath7 , evolves more slowly than in the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "effectively , in the latter , @xmath8 while in the interacting case its time evolution of governed by @xmath9 \\ , , \\label{rr}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 denotes the equation of state parameter of de . equation ( [ rr ] ) follows from ( [ cons ] ) and friedmann s equation for spatially flat universes @xmath11 as we will see below , for reasonable and suitably chosen interaction terms , @xmath12 either tends to a constant or varies more slowly than the scale factor , @xmath13 , at late times .",
    "this certainly alleviates the coincidence problem .",
    "it is worthy of note that if @xmath3 were negative ( signifying an energy transfer from dm to de ) the problem would only worsen , moreover at early times the energy density of de would have been negative , and , finally , the second law of thermodynamics could be violated @xcite . except in chamaleon models",
    "@xcite , baryons as well as radiation usually do not participate in the interaction .",
    "the former because of the tight constraints imposed by local gravity measurements @xcite , the latter because otherwise the photons would not longer follow geodesics which would affect precise measurements of deviations of radar signals grazing the sun .",
    "it is not the aim of this article to solve the coincidence problem -we believe it can not be done at present- but to devise a simple strategy to do it , within general relativity , as soon as sufficiently accurate and abundant data on the evolution of the hubble factor becomes available .",
    "this paper extends and generalizes a previous work of the authors @xcite .",
    "most studies of late acceleration implicitly assume that matter and dark energy interact gravitationally only . in the absence of an underlying symmetry that would suppress a matter - dark energy coupling ( or interaction )",
    "there is no a priori reason to discard it .",
    "further , the coupling is not only likely but inevitable @xcite and its introduction is less arbitrary than otherwise . in fact , the accretion of de by black holes @xcite implies a non - vanishing and positive @xmath3 . while its small value modifies only very little the dependence of the energy densities on redshift ( and can not substantially alleviate the coincidence problem )",
    ", it sets a minimum value for the interaction .",
    "the interaction may bring some further consequences .",
    "it can push the beginning of accelerated expansion era to higher redshifts .",
    "it can also erroneously suggest an equation of state for the dark energy of phantom type ( i.e. , @xmath14 ) , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "moreover , the interaction may give rise to fluctuations in the count of galaxy clusters with redshift @xcite .",
    "likewise , the coupling can alter the isothermal maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution of weakly interacting massive particles in the galaxy halos @xcite whereby the average dark matter velocity is expected to increase significantly . since the detection rates of the different experiments searching for dark matter strongly depend on this velocity",
    "it is crucial not to dismiss _ a priori _ the coupling @xcite .",
    "ultimately , the existence or non - existence of the interaction is to be discerned observationally .",
    "whereas the current empirical data are insufficient to settle this issue , a couple of studies seem to favor the former possibility : @xmath15 as it should be expected , the interaction alters the time required for a self - gravitating , collapsing , structure to reach equilibrium as well as the equilibrium configuration itself .",
    "therefore the layzer - irvine equation @xcite is to be generalized to take into account the interaction . in this regard , from the analysis of the dynamics of 33 relaxed galaxy clusters -for which reliable x - ray , weak lensing and optical data are available- , it has been reported a small but not vanishing interaction @xcite .",
    "@xmath16 since the interaction modifies the evolution rate of the metric potentials the integrated sachs - wolfe component of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) is enhanced .",
    "the cross - correlation of galaxy catalogs with cmb maps also hints at a small interaction @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "next section introduces three different expressions for @xmath3 and show that all three lead to a late , everlasting , era of either constant or quasi - constant @xmath12 regardless of whether @xmath17 is lower or higher than @xmath18 .",
    "section 3 shows the consistency of the three interacting models with the recent observational bounds of daly _ et al . _",
    "@xcite based on data from supernovae type ia , taken from different sources , and 30 radio - galaxies .",
    "the only cosmological assumption behind these bounds is that the universe can be considered homogeneous and isotropic at large scales .",
    "section 4 devises a simple strategy to solve the coincidence problem .",
    "finally , section 5 summarizes and discusses our results .",
    "we focus our attention on spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker models . as usual",
    ", a subscript zero means that the corresponding quantity is to be evaluated at present time .",
    "because of the unknown nature of both dm and de it does not seem feasible nowadays to derive an expression for @xmath3 on first principles . the alternative is to propose phenomenological expressions based on arguments of simplicity and reasonableness .",
    "firstly , note that @xmath3 must be small and positive -otherwise the de could not dominate the expansion today . on the other hand ,",
    "if it were large and negative , de would have dominated the expansion practically from the outset and galaxies could nt have condensed .",
    "looking at the left hand side of eqs .",
    "( [ cons ] ) it becomes apparent that @xmath3 must be a function of the energy densities multiplied by a quantity with units of inverse of time .",
    "for the latter the obvious choice is the hubble factor , so @xmath19 . by power law expanding this function and keeping just the first term we get @xmath20 . in view of the lack of information about the coupling it is advisable to retain just one parameter ( the less observational parameters when fitting to observational data , the better ) . then , three choices follow , namely : @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 . other choices , as @xmath24 @xcite , are also possible but we will not deal with them here",
    ".    we will therefore consider the following three expressions for the coupling , @xmath25 where the phenomenological parameters , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , are dimensionless , positive - definite small constants .",
    "henceforward , we will call the corresponding models alpha , beta , and eta , respectively .",
    "model alpha fits very well data from sn ia , cmb , and large scale structure formation provided @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "further , this model possesses the remarkable property that the ratio @xmath12 tends to a stationary but unstable value at early times , @xmath30 , and to a stationary and stable value , @xmath31 , ( an attractor ) at late times .",
    "this follows from inserting the corresponding expression for @xmath3 in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ rr ] ) and setting @xmath32 to zero . for @xmath33 constant the stationary solutions of the resulting quadratic equation",
    "are : @xmath34    as it can be checked by slightly perturbing the right hand side of eq.([rr ] ) , the stationary solution @xmath30 results unstable while @xmath31 is stable @xcite .",

    "the function @xmath43 decreases monotonously .",
    "consequently , as the universe expands , @xmath43 smoothly evolves from @xmath44 to the attractor solution @xmath31 .",
    "the transition from one asymptotic solution to the other occurred only recently -see left panels of figs .",
    "[ fig : quinteshor ] and [ fig : phantomhor]- so one can take @xmath45 during a fairly large part of the history of the universe .",
    "finally , the constraint @xmath46 constant implies that @xmath12 and @xmath26 are not independent , but verify the relationship @xmath47 , so the product @xmath48 is of order unity .",
    "as indicated above , this choice of @xmath3 yields a constant but unstable ratio at early times and constant and stable lower ratio at late times -left panels of figs .",
    "[ fig : quinteshor ] and [ fig : phantomhor ] .",
    "it is hard to imagine a simpler expression for the coupling entailing these two properties .",
    "likewise , the aforesaid expression can be re - interpreted as implying an effective exponential potential for the dark energy field at late times and a power - law at early times @xcite .",

    "thus , the initial condition problem is significantly alleviated .",
    "for example , if @xmath63 , the initial dark matter to dark energy ratio comes to be @xmath64 .    model beta does not share the nice feature of a late attractor .",

    "hence , the evolution of @xmath12 is slower than in the @xmath0cdm model .",

    "[ fig : phantomhor ] ) . for vanishing scale factor",
    "@xmath12 tends to the finite , constant value @xmath68 ( however , the model should not be extrapolated to such an early stage ) .",
    "thus , in spite of the absence of a late time attractor this choice of @xmath3 also significantly alleviates the coincidence problem as the energy density ratio varies very slowly at present time , i.e. , @xmath69 .",
    "this feature is shared by model eta -see right panel in figs . [",
    "fig : quinteshor ] and [ fig : phantomhor ] .",
    "altogether , all three models considerably alleviate the coincidence problem but there is no guarantee that any of them solves it in full .",
    "a successful model should also predict @xmath70 . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "no model in the market does this .",
    "we believe that , for the time being , the present value of @xmath12 must be considered an input parameter much in the same way as the current value of the hubble function , @xmath71 , the temperature of the cmb , the age of the universe , or the ratio between the number of baryons and photons , are -only that the four latter are not laden with any puzzle .",
    "we wish to explore whether the interacting , models alpha , beta , and eta , are consistent with the results of daly _ et al .",
    "these are based in the determination of the dimensionless coordinate distance , @xmath72 , and their two first derivatives with respect to redshift , of supernovae type ia ( sn ia ) and radio - galaxies ( rg ) in the redshift interval @xmath73 .",

    "the successful model must also predict @xmath113 .    in this paper we considered three interacting models that present the first characteristic and",
    "may also have the second one . to decide on",
    "the latter one must contrast the @xmath114 function predicted by each model with observation .",
    "regrettably , as far as we know , model - independent data about @xmath114 do not exist .",
    "however , albeit with wide uncertainties , there exist model - independent data of the evolution of the hubble factor up to @xmath168 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have numerically determined @xmath164 and @xmath115 for each model and compared the latter with these observational data .",
    "all three models show compatibility with the data but only in a degree similar to the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "future , more accurate and extensive measurements will likely tell us whether the latter model fits the data better or worse than interacting models ( the ones presented in this paper or maybe others ) .",
    "if , in the end , the @xmath0cdm model makes the best fit , then we may conclude that the coincidence problem is not a problem any more ; it is simply a coincidence and therefore not a problem .",
