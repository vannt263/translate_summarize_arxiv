    "the identity of the dark matter of the universe is unknown .",
    "an interesting possibility is that it is a relatively light particle of mass of order @xmath0 , interacting with the standard model particles through a @xmath1 gauge boson ( dark photon ) that mixes with the photon  @xcite .",
    "this avoids stringent constraints from dark matter direct detection experiments  @xcite while still allows for understanding the current dark matter abundance as the thermal relic from the early universe , if the mixing between the dark and standard model photons is adequately suppressed .",
    "this potentially elegant scenario , however , suffers from the issue of naturalness .",
    "first of all , if the dark matter is a fermion , then the constraint on its late annihilations from observations of the cosmic microwave background excludes the scenario  @xcite .",
    "this ( essentially ) forces the dark matter to be a scalar , in which case the constraint is avoided because of the @xmath5-wave suppression of the annihilation cross section  @xcite .",
    "this , however , raises the question :  why do we have such a light scalar ? this is puzzling , especially given that a scalar mass is generally unstable under quantum corrections",
    ". a similar question can also be raised for the dark photon , whose mass must be in the same range as the scalar mass for phenomenological reasons .    in this paper , we present a simple model addressing this issue , in which the dark matter arises as a `` dark pion '' of new gauge interactions with the dynamical scale @xmath6 . the dark photon is introduced by gauging a @xmath1 subgroup of the flavor symmetry of this sector so that its mass is generated by the same dynamics as the one forming the dark pion .",
    "the model has the following salient features :    * gauge symmetry of the model does not allow any mass term for the constituent `` dark quarks . ''",
    "the model , therefore , is fully ( i.e.   not only technically ) natural  the masses of all the new particles arise from the dynamics of new gauge interactions . * despite the lack of dark quark masses , all the new particles of the model have nonzero masses .",
    "in particular , both the dark pion and dark photon obtain masses of the same order , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the gauge coupling associated with the dark photon . * the stability of the dark pion is ensured as a result of an accidental symmetry of the model .",
    "this accidental symmetry is an extremely good symmetry unless the cutoff scale of the theory is very low .",
    "we find that the model is phenomenologically viable and has interesting implications .",
    "in particular ,    * there is a significant parameter region in which the dark pion comprises the dark matter of the universe . in this region ,",
    "the dark pion mass is comparable but smaller than the dark photon mass , which is of order @xmath0 .",
    "the mixing parameter between the dark and standard model photons is in the range @xmath9 . * in a corner of the allowed parameter region , the discrepancy of the muon @xmath3 between the experimental result and standard model prediction  @xcite is ameliorated due to a loop contribution of the dark photon .",
    "clearly , the model may also ameliorate the muon @xmath3 discrepancy even if the dark pion does not comprise all of the dark matter . *",
    "the model predicts a plethora of new resonances around @xmath10 , some of which may be detectable in future experiments . in particular , one of the lowest - lying spin - one @xmath11- and @xmath12-odd states , the dark rho meson @xmath13 , mixes with the dark photon and hence couples to the standard model fermions .",
    "this provides a monophoton signal , e.g.  @xmath14 , which can be probed by the belle  ii experiment .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : model ] , we present our model and analyze its dynamics . in section  [ sec : dark - pion ] , we study physics of the dark pion as dark matter .",
    "we present a parameter region in which the dark pion is dark matter while avoiding constraints from existing experiments and observations . in section",
    "[ sec : g-2 ] , we discuss the muon @xmath3 . finally , in section  [ sec : rho ] , we discuss the possibility of detecting the dark rho meson .",
    "the model has a gauge group @xmath15 , whose dynamical scale ( the mass scale of generic low - lying resonances ) is @xmath16 , and two flavors of dark quarks transforming under it .",
    "in addition , we introduce an abelian @xmath17 gauge group under which the dark quarks are charged as in table  [ tab : charge ] while the standard model particles are singlet .",
    ".charge assignment of the dark quarks under the @xmath18 and @xmath17 gauge groups . here ,",

    "this makes the theory chiral , i.e.  the mass terms of the dark quarks are forbidden by the @xmath17 gauge symmetry , so that the only free parameters in this sector are the dynamical scale of @xmath18 , @xmath25 , and the gauge coupling of @xmath17 , @xmath8 .",

    "we next discuss couplings between the dark and standard model sectors .",
    "these couplings are induced by a kinetic mixing between the hypercharge , @xmath53 , and @xmath17 gauge bosons , defined by @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the @xmath53 and @xmath17 gauge field strengths , and @xmath57 is the weinberg angle . in the limit @xmath58 , the @xmath59 boson and the photon couple to the standard model particles as usual , and the dark photon couples to @xmath51 through interactions in eq .",

    "the standard model @xmath59 boson also couples to the @xmath17 charged particles as @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the @xmath17 current .",
    "finally , we mention that spontaneous breaking of the @xmath17 symmetry generates cosmic strings .",
    "observational constraints on them , however , are very weak and do not affect the phenomenology discussed below .",

    "these symmetries guarantee the stability of dark baryons and the dark pion @xmath51 , respectively . in the early universe ,",
    "dark baryons effectively annihilate into dark pions , so that their thermal abundance is negligible .",
    "we are therefore left with the dark pion as our dark matter candidate .",
    "the @xmath22 symmetry , in fact , is an extremely good symmetry .",
    "the @xmath18 and @xmath17 gauge symmetries forbid interactions that explicitly break the @xmath22 symmetry up to dimension eight . therefore , unless the scale suppressing higher dimension operators is very low , the dark pion is stable at cosmological timescales .",
    "the phenomenology of the dark particles depends significantly on the ratio of the masses of the dark pion , @xmath72 , and dark photon , @xmath73 .",
    "below we discuss three cases @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 in turn .",
    "the case @xmath74 occurs if the @xmath17 charge @xmath77 is sufficiently small or if @xmath78 is sufficiently large .",

    "this is because the intermediate dark photon has an odd @xmath11 parity and hence the initial state dark pions must be in @xmath5-wave .",

    "<S> an interesting possibility for dark matter is a scalar particle of mass of order @xmath0 , interacting with a @xmath1 gauge boson ( dark photon ) which mixes with the photon . </S>",
    "<S> we present a simple and natural model realizing this possibility . the dark matter arises as a composite pseudo nambu - goldstone boson ( dark pion ) in a non - abelian gauge sector , which also gives a mass to the dark photon . for a fixed non - abelian gauge group , @xmath2 , and a @xmath1 charge of the constituent dark quarks , </S>",
    "<S> the model has only three free parameters :  the dynamical scale of the non - abelian gauge theory , the gauge coupling of the dark photon , and the mixing parameter between the dark and standard model photons . in particular , the gauge symmetry of the model does not allow any mass term for the dark quarks , and stability of the dark pion is understood as a result of an accidental global symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the model has a significant parameter space in which thermal relic dark pions comprise all of the dark matter , consistently with all experimental and cosmological constraints . in a corner of the parameter space , </S>",
    "<S> the discrepancy of the muon @xmath3 between experiments and the standard model prediction can also be ameliorated due to a loop contribution of the dark photon . </S>",
    "<S> smoking - gun signatures of the model include a monophoton signal from the @xmath4 collision into a photon and a `` dark rho meson . </S>",
    "<S> '' observation of two processes in @xmath4 collision , the mode into the dark photon and that into the dark rho meson , would provide strong evidence for the model . </S>"
