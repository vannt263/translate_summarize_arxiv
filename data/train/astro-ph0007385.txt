    "ring nebulae around wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars were first reported by @xcite .",
    "the first three wr rings reported , ngc2359 , ngc6888 , and s308 @xcite , all show an indisputable shell morphology . since then many more ring nebulae have been identified in the galaxy @xcite and in the magellanic clouds @xcite .",
    "a wide range of morphology is observed in these wr ring nebulae , but most of these nebulae do not have a distinct ring morphology as did the first three identified . while a small number of the wr ring nebulae may be misidentifications , in which the wr stars are not responsible for the nebular morphology ; the majority of them may represent the cumulative product of interactions between the ambient interstellar medium ( ism ) and the stellar winds since the star was formed .    to explain the wide range of morphology observed in wr rings , analytic models and numerical simulations",
    "have been put forward for wind - blown bubbles in different media : in a homogeneous ism ( e.g. , weaver et al . 1977 ) , in a cloudy ism @xcite , and in a circumstellar medium @xcite .",
    "the most sophisticated models for wr ring nebulae have been presented by garca - segura et al .",
    "( 1996a , b ) , who have taken into account the evolution and mass loss history over the lifetime of the central star .",
    "these models show that an interstellar bubble is formed around a massive star during its main sequence lifetime and subsequently a circumstellar bubble will be formed interior to the interstellar bubble after the star has made a transition from a red supergiant ( rsg ) or luminous blue variable ( lbv ) to a wr star .",
    "they further predict that evolved circumstellar bubbles will fragment and form `` break - out '' regions where the shock fronts ( as traced by [ ]  emission ) lead the fragmented circumstellar shell material ( traced by h@xmath0  and [ ]  emission ) .",
    "the models of garca - segura et al .",
    "( 1996a , b ) are successful in explaining the morphology and chemical abundances of ngc6888 and s308 , but it is difficult to generalize this success to more wr rings for two reasons .",
    "first , most of the wr ring nebulae have non - distinctive ring morphology , and hence their physical nature is uncertain and comparisons with models can produce ambiguous results at best .",
    "second , most wr ring nebulae do not have detailed follow - up observations of morphology , kinematic properties , or chemical abundances for comparison with models .    to study the structure and evolution of ring nebulae around wr stars and to compare them to garca - segura et al.s ( 1996a , b ) models ,",
    "we have selected a set of wr nebulae that have the most well - defined , distinct shell morphology .",
    "these are the wr nebulae that have the most complete kinematic and abundance information available , and they are the most likely to yield meaningful results .",
    "we have imaged these wr rings in h@xmath0  and [ ] @xmath15007 emission , and used the nebular morphology in these two spectral lines to study the physical structure of these nebulae .",
    "we have examined their physical structures in conjunction with the chemical abundances , kinematic properties and sizes of the shells , and the spectral type of the wr stars .",
    "this examination is supported by comparison to models of wr ring evolution .",
    "the results are reported in this paper . in  2 we describe the observations , in  3 we describe individual objects , and in  4 we discuss the physical significance of the [ ]  and h@xmath0  morphologies , and compare the observed nebular morphologies to models and discuss their evolutionary stage .",
    "the observations were obtained with the 1  m telescope at the mount laguna observatory ( mlo ) and the curtis schmidt telescope at cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) in several observing runs .",
    "the journal of observations is given in table  [ observe_tab ] .",
    "the mlo 1  m observations were made with two substantially different detectors and narrow band filter sets .",
    "observations made before 1992 used a ti 800@xmath2800 ccd as a detector and used a focal reducer .",
    "the resulting images have 098 pixels and cover a 131 field - of - view .",
    "the typical seeing was @xmath32when these images were taken , but the focal reducer degraded the image quality at the edge of the field to @xmath34 .",
    "the h@xmath0  filter used had a central wavelength of 6567   and fwhm of 62   and thus also transmitted the [ ] @xmath46548 , 6584 lines . the [ ]",
    "observations were made with a filter centered at 5015   with fwhm of 49  , which isolated the [ ] @xmath15007 line .",
    "the observations made after 1992 at mlo used a loral 2k@xmath22k ccd . here the individual frames have a 136 field - of - view with 04 pixel@xmath5 scale .",
    "typical seeing during the observations was between 15 and 20 .",
    "the filter used for the h@xmath0   observations has a fwhm of 20  centered at 6563   which should isolate the h@xmath0  line from most emission of the nearby [ ] @xmath46548 , 6584 lines .",
    "the [ ]  filter had a fwhm of 50 centered at 5010  .",
    "observations of rcw104 were obtained with the ctio curtis schmidt on june 29 , 1992 .",
    "a thompson 1k@xmath21k ccd detector was used with a 31  field - of - view and 184 pixel@xmath5 scale . the filter used for the h@xmath0  observation had a fwhm of 17    centered at 6563  , while the [ ]  filter had a fwhm of 44    centered at 5007  .",
    "the observations of rcw58 were also obtained with the curtis schmidt at ctio on december 31 , 1996 .",
    "these observations used a tektronics 2k@xmath22k ccd detector with a 69  field - of - view and 203 pixel@xmath5 scale .",
    "the filter used for the h@xmath0  observations was centered at 6568   with a fwhm of 30  , while the [ ]   filter had a fwhm of 40   centered at 5023  .",
    "the observations of ngc6888 , s308 , wr128 , and wr134 required multiple fields to cover the entire nebula ( or in the case of s308 to cover a portion of the object ) .",
    "the individual frames have been combined into a single mosaic for each object .",
    "each frame was registered to adjacent frames using the stars in the region of overlap between frames .",
    "furthermore , the observing conditions often varied substantially over the course of the observations .",
    "the offset due to changing sky background for the frames in each mosaic image were removed using the method outlined in @xcite .    for each final image or mosaic an astrometric solution",
    "was found for the final image by comparison to stellar positions in the guide star catalog 1.2 @xcite .",
    "the absolute positional accuracy for each image is better than 04 . more important for this work",
    ", the relative position accuracy of the h@xmath0  and [ ]  images is estimated from the stellar images . in this case",
    "the typical uncertainty in the registration between the h@xmath0  and [ ]  images has been reduced to less than 0.1 pixels .",
    "we detect h@xmath0  and [ ]  emission from all eight wr nebulae . in figures 1 through 8 we present the h@xmath0  and [ ]  images of these wr ring nebulae .",
    "in addition to the emission line images of each nebula , we present an [ ]  to h@xmath0  ratio image to show the relative position of [ ]  and h@xmath0  emission .",
    "note that the ratios are relative rather than absolute because most of the observations were made during non - photometric conditions .",
    "in the [ ] /h@xmath0  ratio images , strong h@xmath0  emission ( relative to [ ] ) appears dark ( black ) while regions where [ ]  emission is comparatively bright appear light ( white ) .",
    "the ratio maps ( panel c in figures 1 - 8 ) help highlight the locations where the h@xmath0  and [ ]  morphology show spatial differences . in many cases",
    "the ratio maps clearly demonstrate that the outer edge of the wr bubble as seen in [ ]  emission ( the [ ]  front ) is exterior to the edge of the bubble as traced by h@xmath0  emission ( the h@xmath0  front ) .",
    "careful examination of the h@xmath0  and [ ]  images show four types of relationship between the h@xmath0  and [ ]  fronts :    * type i morphology has no measurable offset between the h@xmath0  and [ ]  fronts .",
    "this type includes ngc2359 and g2.4 + 1.4 . *",
    "type ii morphology has an h@xmath0  front trailing closely behind an [ ]  front , and both fronts have a similar shape",
    ". examples of this type include wr128 wr134 , s308 , and parts of ngc6888 ( the caps along the major axis ) .",
    "* type iii morphology has bright h@xmath0  emission trailing far behind a faint [ ]  front . in this type ,",
    "the h@xmath0  appearance can differ significantly from the [ ]  appearance , for example , rcw58 . *",
    "type iv morphology has a faint [ ]  front with no h@xmath0  counterpart .",
    "for example , rcw104 and parts of ngc6888 ( along the minor axis ) .    in table",
    "[ parm_tab ] we present the physical parameters measured along with values taken from the literature .",
    "there we include : spectral type of the wr star , distance , wr wind velocity and mass loss rate , wr bubble radius as measured from the [ ]  image , wr bubble expansion velocity , dynamical timescale ( @xmath6radius / v@xmath7 ) , the angular and linear size of typical offset between h@xmath0  and [ ]  emission , the type of offsets observed , nebular abundances , and galactocentric distance .",
    "s308 , around the wn5 star hd50896 , is the closest wr ring nebula that has been identified .",
    "the low surface brightness and large angular diameter , @xmath340 , of this the nebula make imaging the entire structure difficult .",
    "figure  [ s308_fig ] shows the northwest and western limbs which are also the brightest portion of the bubble .",
    "a large , type ii , offset between the [ ]  and h@xmath0  emission is clearly visible along the northern and western rims of s308 .",
    "a dramatic `` break - out '' structure is evident in the northwest corner ( best seen in the [ ]  image , figure  [ s308_fig]b ) .      the wr bubble in ngc2359 ( see figure  [ ngc2359_fig ] ) is associated with the the wn4 star , hd56925 . the [ ] /h@xmath0  ratio image shows no offset between the tracers ( a type i morphology ) along the main shell structure , similar to the ratio maps shown by @xcite .",
    "in addition to the wr bubble , there also appears a second , larger , parabolic arc of emission which shares its eastern boundary with the wr ring nebula .",
    "this arc of material is bounded by an hii region to the south and molecular material to the east and south @xcite .",
    "rcw58 ( see figure  [ rcw58_fig ] ) is associated with the wn8 star hd96548 ( wr40 ) . in h@xmath0",
    "emission the bubble appears to be primarily composed of radial filaments , while the fainter [ ]  emission appears smoother and significantly more extended ( type iii morphology ) . the extended [ ]",
    "morphology was originally noted by @xcite and is one of the clearest offsets between the h@xmath0  and [ ] emission in our sample .",
    "part of the extended [ ]  emission on the eastern limb appears to form a concave bulge significantly different from h@xmath0  morphology that may be a pronounced `` break - out '' structure .",
    "rcw104 ( see figure  [ rcw104_fig ] ) was originally identified by @xcite around the wn5 star hd147419 ( wr75 ) .",
    "due to complex filamentary h@xmath0  emission on the same sight line , the h@xmath0  emission associated with the wr star is not clearly defined except on the western limb .",
    "the [ ]  emission has a limb  brightened `` barrel  shaped '' appearance that is composed of tangential filaments on the eastern and western limbs .",
    "the southwestern limb is the only location where both h@xmath0  and [ ]  emission are observed . at this location",
    ", there appears to be a slight , type ii , offset of the [ ]  emission exterior to the h@xmath0  limb .",
    "the entire eastern limb shows no h@xmath0  counterpart and therefore is classified as type iv morphology . in the southwestern corner the [ ]",
    "emission has a faint structure similar in character to the `` break  out '' structure in rcw58 and s308 .",
    "g2.4@xmath81.4 ( see figure  [ wr102_fig ] ) is another ring nebulae in our sample that has no discernible offset between [ ]  and h@xmath0  ( type i morphology ) . among the wr stars in our sample , wr102 , or lss4368 ,",
    "is the only wo star .",
    "the field around wr102 is highly confused by interstellar emission along the same sight line .",
    "@xcite have made extensive kinematic observations and suggested that the bubble is a `` blister '' structure on the front of a dense cloud .",
    "previous h@xmath0  and [ ]  images of nebulosity associated with wr128 have concentrated on the two prominent arcs to the north and east of the central wn4 star , hd187282 .",
    "there are no published emission line images that extend an equal distance to the south and west to determine whether the partial ring has other components .",
    "we have imaged an area that extends as far south and west as to the north and east and and confirm that there is no bright h@xmath0  or [ ]  emission on the opposite side of hd187282 .",
    "our images ( figure  [ wr128_fig ] ) do show that the arc east of hd187282 continues further south than previously known @xcite .",
    "the composite image ( figure  [ wr128_fig]c ) shows that the [ ] emission is significantly offset exterior from the h@xmath0  emission with respect to the central star ( type ii morphology ) .",
    "recent hi observations by @xcite show that there is an hole coincident with wr128 . in the h@xmath0  image",
    "the arc of `` limb - brightened ''",
    "emission appears to be `` filled '' with low surface brightness emission from the shell to roughly the position of the wr star .",
    "wr134 ( see figure  [ wr134_fig ] ) is the wn6 star hd191765 .",
    "the nebular images show markedly different morphology in h@xmath0  and [ ] .",
    "the h@xmath0   image shows a hemisphere of filamentary emission along with non - uniform diffuse h@xmath0  emission .",
    "the [ ]  emission is all filamentary and is only present to the northwest of hd191765 .",
    "much of the h@xmath0  emission southwest of the wr star has been shown by @xcite to be kinematically distinct from the filamentary emission . the [ ]",
    "filaments appear slightly offset radially outward with respect to the h@xmath0  filaments ( type ii morphology ) .",
    "the wr star is projected close to the center of the filamentary emission . in the composite image ,",
    "offsets between the filaments in h@xmath0  and [ ]  are not very clear , in part due to the the large dynamic range in the h@xmath0  image .",
    "the outermost [ ]  filaments are similar in morphology to the `` break - out '' features observed in ngc6888 .",
    "ngc6888 around the wn6 star hd192163 is often regarded as the proto - typical wr bubble .",
    "the h@xmath0  and [ ]  images ( see figure  [ ngc6888_fig ] ) shows a clear offset between the h@xmath0  and [ ]  emission along the limb - brightened shell .",
    "furthermore , a faint network of filamentary structures appear to envelope the h@xmath0  emission ( type ii morphology ) . beside the filamentary structures near the h@xmath0  emission , there is a large [ ]  front with no h@xmath0  counterpart that bulges outward from the northwest limb of the bubble near the minor axis ( type iv morphology ) .",
    "this was previously noted by @xcite and by @xcite . in figure",
    "[ ngc6888_fig]c it is apparent that the total extent of the [ ]  emission is centered on the wr star , while the limb - brightened h@xmath0  shell is off - center .",
    "high resolution hubble space telescope _",
    "wfpc2 _ images of a portion of the shell rim presented by @xcite show the offsets along the shell rim with dramatic clarity .",
    "h@xmath0  and [ ]  line images of a nebula provide useful diagnostics of its physical structure .",
    "h@xmath0  is a recombination line and thus shows the overall distribution of ionized material , but because the line strength of h@xmath0  decreases with temperature its sensitivity drops for temperatures @xmath910@xmath10 k. on the other hand , the [ ]  line originates in a forbidden transition whose upper level is populated by collisional excitation ; therefore , its intensity increases with temperature , and [ ]  line images trace high excitation regions with temperatures @xmath11 k. consequently , we expect the h@xmath0  and [ ]  morphologies to be different , especially over regions where physical conditions change rapidly .    behind a shock front , radiative cooling takes place ; as the temperature drops , the density increases .",
    "thus , a displacement between [ ]  emission and h@xmath0  emission occurs @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the displacement depends on the post - shock temperature , which is determined by the shock velocity , and the cooling rate , which is dependent on the density and metallicity . in cases where a shock propagates into a dense medium ,",
    "the cooling rate behind the shock front is high , the cooling zone is narrow , and the offset between h@xmath0  and [ ]  emission peaks is minimal . for a shock propagating in a tenuous medium ,",
    "the cooling rate is lower , the cooling zone is wider , thus the offset between the h@xmath0  and [ ]  emission peaks is larger and may be observable . if the ambient density is low enough , it is possible that [ ]  emission is observable behind the shock , while h@xmath0   emission is too faint to be detected .",
    "finally , if a shock propagates through a high - density medium and then into a low - density medium , it is possible to see bright h@xmath0emission associated with the dense medium and a leading [ ] front associated the recently shocked low - density medium .",
    "this could produce the largest displacement between the leading edges of h@xmath0  and [ ]  emission .",
    "@xcite has calculated the expected 1-d surface brightness profile for h@xmath12 and [ ]  assuming a planar shock propagating at 100  into a medium with density of 1 @xmath13 ( see figure 3 in cox 1972 ) .",
    "this calculation found the separation between the peak h@xmath12 and [ ]  emission to be roughly 0.001 pc .",
    "for a wr star that had a rsg progenitor , its wr bubble will be expanding into a circumstellar envelope whose density can be calculated from the rsg wind properties . for a rsg mass loss rate of 10@xmath14 m@xmath15  yr@xmath5 and a wind velocity of 50 km  s@xmath5 ,",
    "the rsg wind density at 6 pc from the star would be @xmath30.02 @xmath13 .",
    "if we assume that the shock from the wr bubble expanding into the circumstellar envelope ( rsg wind ) at 100 , then the post - shock density would be @xmath350 times lower and the cooling timescale @xmath350 times longer that cox s results .",
    "thus , the separation between h@xmath0 ( or h@xmath12 ) and [ ] would be @xmath350 times greater , or @xmath30.05 pc .",
    "this order of magnitude estimate is similar to the typical observed separation between h@xmath0  and [ ]  fronts in our sample ( see table  [ parm_tab ] ) .",
    "the four types of relationship between the h@xmath0  and [ ]  fronts described in  3 can all be interpreted as shocks propagating into different ambient media .",
    "wr bubbles with the type i h@xmath0  and [ ] fronts may be expanding into dense media , the cooling rate is high , and the displacement between h@xmath0  and [ ]  emission peaks can not be resolved by our images .",
    "wr bubbles with type ii h@xmath0  and [ ]  fronts are probably expanding into a medium with density low enough that the cooling time behind the shock is long , and therefore an observable displacement between the [ ]  and h@xmath0  fronts is produced .",
    "type iii h@xmath0  and [ ]  fronts can be produced if a shock has propagated through a dense medium into a tenuous medium .",
    "the h@xmath0morphology is determined by the dense medium , while the [ ]   emission traces the progression of the shock in the tenuous medium .",
    "wr bubbles with type iv morphology are expanding into a very tenuous medium .",
    "the post - shock density is low and temperature is high , so that only [ ]  emission , but not h@xmath0 , is strong enough to be detected .",
    "garca - segura et al . ( 1996a , b ) have simulated the hydrodynamical evolution of circumstellar gas around a massive star , taking into account the stellar evolution and mass loss history starting from the main sequence through the wr phase .",
    "wr stars can be descendants of either lbv or rsg progenitors ; accordingly , garca - segura et al .",
    "have simulated nebulae around a 60  star , which has gone through an lbv phase , and a 35  star , which has gone through a rsg phase .",
    "these simulations produce wr bubbles with distinctly different morphologies , kinematics , and abundances .",
    "these predictions , when compared with observations , can be used to determine the evolutionary stage of the wr bubble and the nature of the wr progenitor .    for",
    "a 60  star , @xcite predict that the resulting wr bubble will be observable only in the early wr stage .",
    "after the wr bubble has swept up most of the lbv wind material , it will expand into a low density circumstellar medium .",
    "this drop in the ambient density , causes an increase in the shock velocity and the fragmentation of the dense wr shell .",
    "thus , the resultant observable wr bubble will have a radial filamentary h@xmath0  structure in the dense shell and will be surrounded by [ ]  emission behind the accelerating outer shock in the tenuous circumstellar medium .",
    "this fits precisely the type iii h@xmath0  and [ ] morphology observed in wr bubbles .",
    "indeed @xcite have suggested that rcw58 was produced this way and that its central star is a descendant of a star that went through an lbv phase",
    ".    for a 35  star , @xcite have performed calculations for stars with rsg wind velocities of 15 and 75 .",
    "for the case of a 75   rsg wind velocity , they predict that the swept - up wr shell is dense enough to be observable only during the early stages , when the radius is @xmath16 1 pc . for the case of a rsg with a slow wind , @xmath315 , their model shows that the outer edge of the rsg wind is compressed into a rsg shell and the inner edge is swept up by wr wind into a wr shell .",
    "the wr shell collides with the outer rsg shell after @xmath310@xmath10 years , leading to a deceleration and brightening of the wr shell . after the collision , the dense clumps in the wr shell , having higher inertia , cross the rsg shell and form blow - outs .",
    "eventually , the whole bubble fragments and the shocked wr wind breaks out and forms an outer shock leading the fragmented wr shell .    note that these models can be used only qualitatively as many approximations / simplifications have been made .",
    "we note particularly that the physical distinction between the models using 15 and 75   rsg wind is really in the density of the rsg wind , which is proportional to @xmath17v , where @xmath18 is the mass loss rate of the rsg and v is the rsg wind velocity .",
    "therefore , the model of @xcite for the slow rsg wind is applicable for a faster rsg wind with a larger rsg mass loss rate .",
    "garca - segura et al.s ( 1996a , b ) model for a low - density rsg wind ( low @xmath17v ) produce wr bubbles that have thick shells when they are dense enough to be observable in h@xmath0  and [ ] .",
    "none of the wr bubbles we observe fit this description . on the other hand , their model for a high - density rsg wind ( high @xmath17v )",
    "produce wr bubbles with thin shells that are most observable when the wr shell collides with the rsg shell . within 1,0002,000 years after the collision",
    ", the thin shell expands into a tenuous circumstellar medium and its [ ]  emission should lead the h@xmath0  emission ; similar to the type ii morphology .",
    "after the wr shell fragments and breakouts occur , the outer shocks may be observable in [ ]  but not in h@xmath0 , producing a type iv morphology .",
    "garca - segura et al . ( 1996a , b ) suggested that ngc6888 is produced by a wr star which went through its rsg phase with a slow wind velocity , and s308 with a faster rsg wind velocity .",
    "our images support their interpretation that ngc6888 had a denser rsg wind than s308 .",
    "s308 must be near the stage where the wr shell has collided with the rsg shell . the thickness and break - out structure of the s308 shell are more consistent with the predictions of their slow rsg wind model ( high @xmath17v ) .",
    "we suggest that ngc6888 , s308 , wr128 , wr134 , and rcw104 all have rsg progenitors , and that the rsg wind of ngc6888 was significantly denser than the others .",
    "arc @xcite , which is kinematically different from the [ ]  bubble and has been identified as an hii region @xcite .",
    "future abundance measurements need to be made for the nebula around wr128 and the [ ]  filaments around wr134 to confirm their circumstellar origin . ]    finally , two wr bubbles in our sample do not resemble any of the bubble morphologies expected in garca - segura et al.s ( 1996a , b ) models .",
    "these two bubbles , ngc2359 and g2.4@xmath81.4 , show no offsets between the h@xmath0  and [ ]  fronts .",
    "these two objects are also the smallest and have the slowest expansion velocities . when compared with the other wr bubbles in our sample , their dynamical timescales are long ( old ) for their size .",
    "these results may be explained by their interstellar environment , which is denser than what garca - segura et al .",
    "( 1996a , b ) have assumed .",
    "ngc2359 , being adjacent to molecular clouds , is clearly in a denser interstellar environment .",
    "consequently , the interstellar bubble blown by the progenitor over its main sequence lifetime is small and dense , and the circumstellar bubble of the wr star can easily merge with this interstellar bubble .",
    "the bubble in ngc2359 is dominated by swept - up interstellar material , as indicated by the abundances measured @xcite .",
    "the situation for g2.4@xmath81.4 is less certain because of its confusing line of sight near the galactic center @xcite .      the analysis presented in this paper",
    "has been unavoidably qualitative .",
    "a number of observations are needed to better understand the physical state of circumstellar material around wr star so that a quantitative assessment can be made . due to the low density in the bubbles , flux - calibrated narrow - band imaging in the h@xmath0  line",
    "would yield detailed surface brightness profiles of the gas and allow us to derive the rms density of the bubble .",
    "high - dispersion spectroscopic observations of h@xmath0  and [ ]  would show the relative expansion velocity of shock fronts in each tracer and should verify our interpretation of type iii and iv morphologies .",
    "furthermore , these observations would provide a detailed snapshot of the kinematics of filaments and knots in the fragmenting shell that might identify the instabilities responsible for their formation .",
    "detailed abundance measurements within the shock fronts , filaments , and knots will probe not only the chemical composition but also the nucleosynthetic yields and mixing as a massive star evolves .",
    "finally , sensitive x - ray observations with new instruments such as _ xmm - newton _ would probe the shocked fast wind that drives the nebular expansion .",
    "potentially , these observations could probe the mass loss history of the central star , pinpoint the nature of the progenitor , and make a detailed assessment of the physical processes that occur in bubble formation .",
