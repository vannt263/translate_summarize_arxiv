    "the main goal of this monograph is to further the point of view that many beautiful geometrical and analytical results valid on differentiable manifolds hold on general metric spaces . besides the wider relevance gained by generalization",
    ", the foundations of the subject are clarified when the limits of applicability are explored .",
    "this effort has a long and often disjointed history , only one sliver of which is relevant here .",
    "the approach in this paper , which has been used by several others , is to use the well - known characterization of a vector in a tangent space as an equivalence class of curves which are tangent to each other .",

    "it has been said the three pillars of differential geometry are : @xmath10 the inverse function theorem , @xmath11 the existence theorem for ordinary differential equations ( odes ) and @xmath12 frobenius theorem .",
    "all of these classical theorems may be written with vector fields on manifolds and so may also be written with arc fields on metric spaces .",
    "we expect any result on manifolds which has a sufficiently geometrically realized proof can be generalized to metric spaces using curves in place of vectors . a metric space version of @xmath13 is contained in @xcite , e.g. ; and versions of @xmath11 have been proven several times independently in e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite  see theorem [ cl ] below .",
    "a version of @xmath12 is the main result of this paper , theorem [ frobeniusthm ] : an involutive distribution on a complete metric space is integrable . since the result is for complete metric spaces , it generalizes the classical result on banach manifolds ( proven , e.g. , in @xcite ) .",
    "theorem [ frobeniusthm ] further generalizes the classical result by assuming only lipschitz - type regularity instead of smoothness , which is of interest in , for example , control theory .",
    "as far as i have been able to determine , this particular approach to the proof of frobenius classical theorem has not been vetted in the literature  though it uses basic , well - known ideas .",
    "we outline the approach in this paragraph , simplified to vector fields on a manifold .",
    "the terminology and assumptions will be clarified in the main body of the paper , and figures [ figfrobproof1 ] and [ figfrobproof2 ] from section [ sectionfrobthm ] may aid intuition .",
    "the crux of the local frobenius result in two dimensions is as follows : given two transverse vector fields @xmath14 there exists an integral surface ( tangent to linear combinations of @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) through any point @xmath17 when the lie bracket satisfies @xmath18   = af+bg$ ] for some choice of functions @xmath19 ( involutivity of @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) . to prove this ,",
    "define @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the local flows of @xmath15 and @xmath16 guaranteed to exist by @xmath11 .",
    "since @xmath15 and @xmath16 are transverse , we may choose @xmath23 small enough for @xmath24 to be a well - defined surface .",
    "@xmath24 will be shown to be the desired integral surface through @xmath25 .",
    "notice @xmath24 is tangent to @xmath15 by construction , but it is not immediately clear @xmath24 is tangent to @xmath26 for arbitrarily chosen @xmath27 .",
    "notice , though , that by construction @xmath24 is tangent to @xmath16 at any point @xmath28 , and also @xmath24 is tangent to @xmath29 at @xmath30 for functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "therefore establishing@xmath33 for some functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 , proves @xmath24 is tangent to @xmath34 at an arbitrary point @xmath35 , since the push - forward @xmath36 and the pull - back @xmath37 are inverse to each other and preserve tangency since they are local lipeomorphisms .",
    "next since the lie bracket equals the lie derivative,@xmath38   = af+bg\\ ] ] by involutivity so@xmath39 using the fact that @xmath40 for any @xmath41 , and the linearity of pullback for fixed @xmath42 , we have for functions @xmath43 and @xmath44@xmath45 for some functions @xmath46 and @xmath47",
    ". then since@xmath48 ( where the superscript in round brackets denotes composition @xmath49 times ) we get @xmath50 as follows:@xmath51 completing the sketch for manifolds .",
    "a pivotal fact on which the metric space version relies is that arc fields which satisfy certain lipschitz - type conditions generate unique local flows ( proven in @xcite and reviewed in section [ sectionreview ] ) .",
    "also a natural linear structure may be associated with a metric space ( though it has no _ a priori _ linear structure ) using compositions of flows which faithfully generalizes the linearity of vector fields ; this was introduced in @xcite .",
    "we present this in section [ sectionbracket&linearity ] along with the generalization of the lie bracket for vector fields which uses the well - known asymptotic characterization of the lie bracket ; i.e. , successively follow the flows forward and backward for time @xmath52 .",
    "this investigation further clarifies for us the surprising fact sussman and others have noted : smoothness is not necessary to define a geometrically meaningful lie bracket . in section [ pushfwdsect ] , the pull - back along a flow",
    "is shown to behave naturally with linearity and the bracket , which mimics properties of the lie derivative on manifolds .",
    "many more such algebraic properties are valid than are contained in these sections , but in this monograph we present only the minimum machinery directly relevant to proving frobenius theorem in section [ sectionfrobthm ] .",
    "section [ sectiondist&foliations ] applies this local frobenius theorem to study foliations yielding a global theorem on metric spaces",
    ". a metric space generalization of the nagumo - brezis invariance theorem is proven , which is used to show integrable distributions are involutive .",
    "we do not discuss the facet of the classical global frobenius theorem which guarantees local coordinates on which there exist coordinate vector fields tangent or perpendicular to an involutive distribution . in light of these results",
    ", however , this now seems ripe for exploration .",
    "section [ sectioncommut ] proves a well - known result from hamiltonian dynamics is also valid for metric spaces : two flows commute if and only if the bracket is @xmath53 .",
    "this is not exactly a corollary of the metric space frobenius theorem , but the proof is a mere simplification of that from theorem [ frobeniusthm ] .    finally in section [ sectionexs ]",
    "an almost trivial example applying these ideas has a result which astounded me : any lebesgue square - integrable function may be approximated using successive compositions of two elementary flows , starting from the constant zero function .",
