    "a distinguishing characteristic of type ia supernovae ( sne ) is the large amount of iron that they are thought to produce mainly through the decay of radioactive ni@xmath3 .",
    "the nuclear decay of this material powers the sn light curve , thereby providing a constraint on the quantity of material ejected in individual sn events .",
    "although variation in the amount and distribution of radioactive ejecta likely accounts for the modest range of peak absolute magnitudes seen in type ia sne , by and large sne ia are strikingly homogeneous in their properties . various observational constraints ( e.g. , the absence of hydrogen in optical spectra near optical maximum , occurrence in older stellar populations , and the relatively large amount of ni@xmath3 produced ) have led to the current framework involving carbon deflagration / detonation in a white dwarf driven to the chandrasekhar limit by accretion .",
    "the most likely progenitor system ( branch et al .",
    "1995 ) is a c - o white dwarf accreting h / he - rich gas from a companion , either from its wind or through roche lobe overflow .",
    "remnants of sn  ia should contain about one chandrasekhar mass of ejecta comprised of 0.60.8 @xmath2 of iron with intermediate - mass elements ( o , mg , si , s , ca ) distributed in the outer layers ( e.g. , iwamoto et al .",
    "current models predict that sne ia should leave no compact remnant .",
    "one of the goals of supernova remnant ( snr ) research has been to use remnant properties to infer the nature of the progenitor .",
    "such properties as the partially neutral nature of the surrounding ambient medium ( tuohy et al .  1982 ) or the fe - rich composition of the ejecta ( hughes et al .",
    "1995 ) have been used to argue for a sn  ia origin for some snrs . in this article",
    "we investigate the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) snr 71  ( 0505@xmath467.9 ) which exhibits both of these features .",
    "71  ( davies , elliott , & meaburn 1976 ) was first proposed as a supernova remnant based on the  x - ray survey of the lmc ( long , helfand , & grabelsky 1981 ) .",
    "follow - up optical spectroscopy confirmed this identification and revealed the remnant to be balmer - dominated ( tuohy et al .",
    "1982 ; smith et al .  1991 ) , that is to say , one whose optical spectrum is dominated by hydrogen emission with little or no emission from forbidden lines of [ ] or [ ] . the remnants of tycho s sn and sn1006 are galactic examples of such snrs ( kirshner & chevalier 1978 ; schweizer & lasker 1978 ) .",
    "x - ray studies of 71  ( hughes , hayashi , & koyama 1998 ) yielded an age of @xmath15000 yr and evidence for the presence of sn ejecta in the form of an enhanced global abundance of fe . here",
    "we present results from new  observations of the remnant that bear closely on the nature of the originating sn .",
    "we observed 71  using the back - side - illuminated chip ( s3 ) of the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis - s ) instrument in full - frame timed exposure mode starting on 2000 january 04 for 45.4 ks ( obsid 775 ) .",
    "the reduction of these data proceeded as described in rakowski et al .",
    "our  image was constructed from a subset of a 3-d position - velocity data cube obtained on 71  using the rutgers fabry - perot ( rfp ) at the focus of the ctio 1.5-m on 1998 february 18 .",
    "the rfp data reduction is described in ghavamian et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .      the soft x - ray image of 71  from  ( fig",
    ".  1 , middle panel ) shows emission from an egg - shaped outer rim that matches nearly perfectly the optical  image ( fig .  1 , left panel ) .",
    "features in common include matched variations in surface brightness around the rim as well as the presence of multiple nested filaments , which are particularly noticeable along the southern edge .",
    "faint diffuse emission in the interior of the snr agrees well too .",
    "the remarkable detailed similarity of the x - ray and optical morphology is uncommon among supernova remnants in general .",
    "nearly all of the optical emission in 71  arises in high velocity ( 5001000 km s@xmath5 ) nonradiative shocks , with little contribution from the slow ( @xmath1100 km s@xmath5 ) radiative shocks typically seen in middle - aged remnants .",
    "furthermore the x - ray emission shows broadly similar intrinsic emissivities around the rim ( there are no large variations in abundance or thermodynamic state , see rakowski , ghavamian , & hughes 2002 ) so that surface brightness variations largely trace variations in the ambient gas density around the remnant .",
    "north - south the outer rim spans 83@xmath6 , while in the east - west direction it is only 60@xmath6 across .",
    "any differences between the x - ray and optical sizes are small , no more than a 0.5@xmath6 difference in diameter , with the optical dimensions being marginally larger than the x - ray ones .    the hard x - ray image of 71  ( fig",
    ".  1 , right panel ) shows emission from the outer rim that resembles the soft x - ray and  images .",
    "however , this band also reveals a new spatial component of x - ray emission that has no counterpart in the other bands .",
    "this emission almost fills the interior and appears as a modestly limb - brightened , elliptical shell of emission slightly offset from the geometric center of the outer rim .",
    "the emission extends 40@xmath6 by 32@xmath6 at a position angle ( for the major axis ) of @xmath112@xmath7 east of north and is centered at 05@xmath805@xmath942.6@xmath10 @xmath467@xmath1152@xmath1238.6@xmath6 ( j2000 ) .",
    "hereafter we refer to this as the `` core '' emission .",
    "spectra were extracted from four regions in the remnant s southeastern quadrant ( see figure 1 ) to investigate the soft and hard x - ray emission components .",
    "two spectra of the soft rim ( `` outer '' and `` inner '' ) , corresponding to the two nested filaments that appear here , were extracted .",
    "likewise two spectra of the core x - ray emission ( again `` outer '' and `` inner '' ) were extracted .",
    "background - subtracted count rates are given in table 1 .",
    "background represented less than 0.5% of the source count rate in the 0.25 kev band as taken from a 1@xmath132@xmath13 annulus outside the remnant . before fitting ,",
    "source spectra were rebinned to a minimum of 10 counts per channel .",
    "the rim data sets ( 2 left panels of fig .  2 ) are quite similar as are the core data sets ( 2 right panels ) , but the rim and core spectra differ significantly from each other .",
    "= 18truecm    the abundances and emission properties of the gas were constrained through fits of nonequilibrium ionization ( nei ) planar - shock thermal plasma models ( see hughes , rakowski , & decourchelle 2000 ) .",
    "the abundances of o , ne , mg , si , s , and fe were allowed to vary , while c , n , ar and ca were fixed at 20% of solar and the ni abundance was tied to fe .",
    "the fits were generally acceptabl weith similar best - fit values for similar regions ( see table 1 ) .",
    "absorption of low energy x - rays by intervening gas and dust was included with the hydrogen column density , @xmath14 , as a free parameter .",
    "the values obtained , @xmath14 = 4@xmath15 atoms @xmath16 , are consistent with previous x - ray spectral fits ( hughes et al .  1998 ) and the galactic column density in this direction ( dickey & lockman 1999 ) .",

    "+   +    the ionization timescale of the rim region indicates that the gas is out of equilibrium , as expected .",
    "the fitted abundances are sub - solar and generally consistent with the gas phase lmc values ( russell & dopita 1992 ) .",
    "the fe abundance is derived from the l - shell lines that produce , at ccd spectral resolution , a quasi - continuum blend of emission over the 0.71.5 kev band .",
    "note that our nei spectral model is derived from the original raymond & smith ( 1977 ) code ( and subsequent revisions ) which accurately models the overall flux of the fe l - shell emission , but is less accurate at modeling its detailed spectral variation with photon energy , due to limitations in the availability of atomic data .",
    "this is the case to a greater or lesser extent for all nei spectral models currently available .",
    "typically with such models , the fitted fe abundance is low , while the abundances of ne and mg , whose k - shell lines fall in this energy band , are enhanced to compensate for deficiencies in the modeled fe l - shell emission . nevertheless these spectral fits ( as well as the more comprehensive study of 71 s outer rim in rakowski et al .",
    "2002 ) confidently confirm that the rim region is swept - up interstellar medium ( ism ) heated to x - ray emitting temperatures by a high velocity blast wave .",
    "we note that there is no evidence for a hard power - law tail beyond the thermal emission in the spectrum of the rim .",
    "in marked contrast to the rim regions , the core spectra are dominated by the fe l - shell blend , which peaks near 0.8 kev , and have no significant o line emission at @xmath10.65 kev .",
    "the fitted parameters ( table 1 ) reveal that the abundances of all species , with the exception of o , are considerably greater than the lmc mean , while the abundances of some species , ne and fe in particular , are even greater than solar .",
    "the abundance ratio of iron to oxygen is @xmath05 times the solar ratio .",
    "these large absolute abundances , in addition to the non - solar abundance ratios , signal the presence of supernova ejecta in the core of the remnant .",
    "here we quantitatively examine the properties of the core region to identify the evolutionary state of the remnant and the nature of the originating sn .",
    "the large iron - to - oxygen ratio of the core x - ray emission , as well as its highly - symmetric , well - ordered spatial distribution , immediately suggests a sn  ia origin for 71 .",
    "a critical diagnostic of the sn type is the total mass of ejecta .",
    "we estimate this in two ways , first using dynamical considerations and then from the properties of the core x - ray emission .",
    "the position of the reverse shock ( or contact discontinuity ) relative to that of the blast wave can constrain the evolutionary state of a remnant in the context of self - similar models ( e.g. , truelove & mckee 1999 ) . once the profiles of the ism and ejecta are chosen , this constraint is unique .",
    "although subject to hydrodynamic instabilities , the position of the contact discontinuity between the sn ejecta and the ambient medium is reasonably well identified in our image  it is marked by the outer extent of the core hard emission .",
    "this has a geometric mean radius of 4.3 pc assuming an lmc distance of 50 kpc .",
    "71 s outer blast wave has a geometric mean radius of 8.6 pc , yielding a ratio for the radii of @xmath12 .    in their study of instabilities and clumping in sne ia , wang & chevalier ( 2001 )",
    "present the 1-d radial evolution of the contact discontinuity and blast wave for an exponential ejecta density profile interacting with a constant density ambient medium . for this model ,",
    "the radius of the contact discontinuity is approximately one - half that of the blast wave when the normalized radius of the forward shock is @xmath55 .",
    "the physical radius of the forward shock , @xmath56 , depends on the normalized radius , @xmath57 ; the ejected mass , @xmath58 ; and the ambient hydrogen number density , @xmath59 , through a scaling relation .",
    "inverting , we obtain a relation for the ejected mass in terms of the chandrasekhar mass , @xmath60 @xmath61 which evaluates to @xmath62 for @xmath63 , @xmath64 pc and a mean ambient density of 0.5 @xmath65 ( ghavamian et al .",
    "2002 ) . at this time",
    "the entire ejecta have been thermalized , the reverse shock has just reached the center , and the ejecta are moving outward relatively slowly at @xmath66 100 km s@xmath5 .    for our second ejecta mass estimate ,",
    "we extracted spatially resolved spectra of the core from five concentric elliptical rings spaced by 5@xmath6 ( in semi - major axis length ) .",
    "the annuli had constant ellipticity ( an axial ratio of 1.25 ) and position angle ( 12@xmath7 east of north ) .",
    "each of these spectra contain projected emission from the blast wave , which we removed by subtracting off a spectrum of the bright rim emission scaled independently for each annular ring to zero out the resultant spectrum over the 0.20.6 kev band .",
    "this band was chosen because it shows no evidence for enhanced central emission and thus plausibly corresponds to emission from the blast wave alone .",
    "the count rates of the various spectra range from 0.068 s@xmath5 to 0.38 s@xmath5 .",
    "these spectra all show the broad fe l - shell blend and clearly resolved si and s k@xmath67 lines , but no obvious k@xmath67 lines of o , ne , or mg .",
    "we fit these spectra with the nei spectral model including a minimal set of elemental species : si , s , ar , ca , fe , ni , and a h continuum . to further simplify the model we restricted the number of free parameters in the fits .",
    "the global nei parameters , temperature and ionization timescale , and the ni to fe ratio were constrained to be the same for all five spectra .",
    "we allowed the emission measures ( ems ) of si and fe to vary freely in all the spectra ; however , the s , ar , and ca ems varied along with si at their relative solar abundance ratios .",
    "ems are defined as @xmath68 , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the electron and ion number densities and @xmath71 is the emitting volume .",
    "we fit both the low ( @xmath72 kev ) and high ( @xmath73 kev ) energy portions of the spectra separately in order to ensure that the fits were not being dominated by the `` shape '' of the fe l - shell blend .",
    "in fact both portions of the spectra are broadly consistent with @xmath74 kev and @xmath75 .",
    "finally the fits were performed for three values of the column density , @xmath76 atoms @xmath65 , fixed separately for three different sets of fits , in order to estimate uncertainties on the parameters .",
    "the fits are not particularly good from a @xmath54 point - of - view , but most of the residuals are associated with the fe - l shell blend .    from the fits we obtain numerical values for the ems of the fe and si - group elements as a function of radius in the core region .",
    "for simplicity we assume spherical geometry for the deprojection .",
    "if the true 3-d shape of the core region were ellipsoidal , then our mass estimates would be some 13% higher ( prolate ) or lower ( oblate ) .",
    "we assume that the fe and si - group components are co - spatial , although we allow for the components to contribute in differing proportions in each radial shell .",
    "the mean charge state of each species in the fit is calculated using the values quoted above for @xmath22 and @xmath77 .",
    "for example , the mean number of electrons per ion is 11.8 for si and 18.2 for fe .",
    "= 0.98    the main uncertainty in converting ems to fe and si density and mass estimates is not knowing which species contribute electrons . in a solar abundance plasma",
    ", there are @xmath1@xmath78 electrons ( mostly from hydrogen ) per fe ion , compared to the roughly 50 electrons per fe ion in a pure metal plasma .",
    "thus if even just a small quantity of hydrogen were mixed into the ejecta , it would drastically affect the derived densities .",
    "our spectral fits are inconclusive regarding the amount of hydrogen present in the core region .",
    "the spectral fits discussed here require a relatively high level of broadband continuum emission , yet in other fits we performed a wide range of continuum intensities were inferred , while the ems of the metals remained fairly stable . furthermore , although we have modeled a hydrogen continuum , any fully stripped ion could produce the requisite featureless spectrum .",
    "thus in lieu of a definitive result we present a couple of astrophysically plausible estimates . for one",
    "we assume that the metals are the sole source of electrons , which yields maximal density estimates .",
    "for the other we make the plausible assumption that a comparable mass of hydrogen has been well mixed into the metal rich ejecta during its evolution .",
    "the deprojected fe and si densities versus radius are plotted in figure 3 .",
    "each clearly shows enhanced density around 34 pc indicating a thick shell structure with the si slightly ahead of the fe .",
    "fe is present even in the center of the remnant , while si is absent there . integrating the density profiles we obtain total masses of 1.5 @xmath2 of fe and 0.24 @xmath2 of si assuming a pure metal composition for the emitting material .",
    "the curves for the case with a modest admixture of hydrogen are quite similar in shape to those of the pure metal case ( see figure 3 ) , although the ion densities we infer are about a factor of two lower .",
    "the total amount of fe is 0.8 @xmath2 and that of si is 0.12 @xmath2 .",
    "the spatial and spectral analysis of the  acis data reveal 71  to be a textbook example of a supernova remnant : an outer blast wave shock propagating through the ism that surrounds a core of sn ejecta heated to x - ray  emitting temperatures by the inward moving reverse shock .",
    "our analysis strongly argues for a type ia sn origin for 71 .",
    "specifically we find ( 1 ) a large fe to o ratio in the ejecta x - ray emission ; ( 2 ) @xmath11.5 @xmath2 of ejecta from dynamical considerations ; ( 3 ) a relatively low mass ratio of si to fe ( @xmath10.15 ) ; and ( 4 ) a large mass of ejected fe ( @xmath10.8 @xmath2 ) .",
    "these results are all consistent with sn  ia ejecta and further may have some power to discriminate between models for how the flame front propagates in these explosions ( see , e.g. , iwamoto et al .",
    "the ejecta are mostly contained within a thick shell and are partially stratified . according to our deprojection analysis",
    ", fe extends throughout the entire ejecta even into the center , while si appears to be contained only within the outer half of the ejecta .    a considerably deeper  observation of 71  has been approved for observation in cycle 4 .",
    "this will allow us to search for and study spectral variations within the fe - rich ejecta and to determine its morphology in greater detail .",
    "measuring the kinematics of the fe - rich ejecta is an important next step .",
    "unfortunately this is likely to be beyond the capabilities of , , and even 2 , although the constellation - x facility , if it attains angular resolution of 10@xmath6 , should be able to detect the expected motions of @xmath1100 km s@xmath5 .",
    "we are also pursuing ground - based optical searches for coronal [ ] @xmath795303   line emission from the ejecta , which could provide complementary insights into the nature and dynamics of the ejecta .",
    "we thank ted williams for assistance with the fabry - perot observations , leisa townsley for allowing us to use her cti corrector software , and john nousek and dave burrows for help with the original proposal .",
