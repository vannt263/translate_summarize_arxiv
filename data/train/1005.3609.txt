    "the @xmath0-colouring problem consists in assigning to each of the vertices of a graph @xmath5 any one of @xmath0 different colours , in such a way that adjacent vertices carry different colours .",
    "the number of possible colourings ( possibly zero ) is known as the chromatic polynomial @xmath6 of the graph .",
    "although this definition supposes that @xmath0 is a positive integer , it is not hard to show @xcite that @xmath6 is indeed a polynomial in @xmath0 , and so the number of colours can be regarded as a formal variable .    the history of the @xmath0-colouring problem is long and interesting , and we refer the reader to @xcite for an extensive list of references .",
    "the case where @xmath5 is a _ planar _",
    "graph has attracted particular interest .",
    "a well - known result is then the four - colouring theorem @xcite which states that @xmath7 for any planar @xmath5 .",
    "other results exploit the extension of @xmath6 to non - integer values of @xmath0 .",
    "one interesting question is whether there exists , in the planar case , some @xmath8 so that @xmath9 for all @xmath10 .",
    "this statement has been established as a theorem @xcite for @xmath11 , and the so - called birkhoff - lewis conjecture @xcite that this extends to @xmath12 is widely believed to be true .    apart from these general results , the case where @xmath5 is a _ regular _ planar lattice  typically square or triangular  has also been intensively studied .",
    "in particular , a long series of papers @xcite is devoted to the study of the location and properties of chromatic zeroes , @xmath13 , in the complex @xmath0-plane for a variety of boundary conditions .",
    "some of the mechanisms responsible for the generation of real chromatic zeroes in the region @xmath14 $ ] have even been understood analytically @xcite .",
    "one should also mention that there exists a family of planar graphs with real chromatic roots converging to @xmath15 from below @xcite .",
    "an important technical ingredient in the studies of chromatic zeroes is the possibility to build up @xmath6 , for regular lattice strips of a given width @xmath2 , by means of a transfer matrix @xmath16 . in order to elucidate the amazingly intricate behaviour of the chromatic polynomial in the thermodynamical limit , it is clearly desirable to be able to access as large @xmath2 as possible in these computations .    in the present paper",
    "we show how to improve the constructions of @xcite by writing @xmath16 as a product of _ sparse _ matrices , each of dimension @xmath1 .",
    "this is implemented in an efficient way , that enables us to compute exactly @xmath6 for rectangles as large as @xmath17 . using the finite - lattice method",
    "@xcite this results in series expansions  in powers of @xmath18of the bulk , surface and corner free energies of the chromatic polynomial .",
    "to give an idea of the improvement on existing results , the bulk free energy series on the square lattice was taken to order @xmath19 in @xcite , and very recently extended to order @xmath20 in @xcite .",
    "we here add a further 32 terms to this latter series , taking it to order @xmath3 .",
    "the surface and corner free energies are similarly obtained to orders @xmath3 and @xmath21 .",
    "the case of the triangular lattice  which does not appear to have been studied previously in terms of series expansions of the free energy  turns out to be particularly interesting .",
    "baxter @xcite has shown that for this lattice the chromatic polynomial possesses an integrable structure .",
    "this permitted him to derive an analytical expression for the bulk free energy , in the form of an infinite product formula , valid in the region @xmath22 \\cup [ 4,\\infty)$ ] .",
    "we obtain in this case the bulk , surface and corner free energies to order @xmath4 .",
    "our results validate baxter s result for the bulk free energy , and permit us to conjecture also the exact infinite product formulae for the surface and corner free energies .",
    "we first recall how the chromatic polynomial appears as a special case of the partition function of the @xmath0-state potts model . given a finite undirected graph @xmath23 with vertex set @xmath24 and edge set @xmath25 ,",
    "the hamiltonian of the potts model is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the coupling constant , and a spin @xmath28 is defined at each vertex @xmath29 .",
    "the kronecker delta function @xmath30 equals 1 if @xmath31 , and 0 otherwise .    setting @xmath32 ,",
    "the partition function can be rewritten as @xmath33 \\label{z1 } \\\\   & = & \\sum_{a \\subseteq e } q^{k(a ) } v^{|a| } \\ , , \\label{z2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the number of connected components in the subgraph @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the number of elements in the edge subset @xmath37 . in the rewriting ( [ z2])known as the fortuin - kasteleyn ( fk )",
    "representation @xcite@xmath0 does no longer need to be an integer , and in particular can be used as an expansion parameter . for",
    "@xmath38 , only the term with @xmath39whence @xmath40contributes , and thus one can develop @xmath41 in powers of @xmath18 .",
    "the chromatic polynomial appears as the special case @xmath42 , @xmath43 as is evident from ( [ z1 ] ) .",
    "thanks to the fk representation ( [ z2 ] ) , the partition function for a lattice strip of width @xmath2 can be built using a transfer matrix @xmath16 of dimension independent of @xmath0 @xcite . in this section",
    "we briefly review the necessary formalism , with the minor modification that we rewrite things in terms of @xmath44 rather than @xmath0 , since this is more convenient for our series expansion purposes .",
    "we then introduce several improvements :    1 .   a factorisation of @xmath16 into sparse matrices that requires only the use of non - nearest - neighbour and almost non - nearest - neighbour partitions",
    "an efficient labelling of non - nearest - neighbour partitions by natural numbers . 3 .",
    "the use of modular arithmetic instead of arbitrary - precision integer arithmetic .",
    "the combination of these ingredients will yield an efficient algorithm that allows , in particular , to add further terms to the series expansions of @xcite .",
    "let us start by noting that , in view of ( [ z2 ] ) , @xmath16 can be taken to act on states which are partitions of the vertex set @xmath45 corresponding to a single horizontal layer of spins .",
    "the role of @xmath16 is to propagate the system one lattice spacing upwards in the vertical direction .",
    "the states describe how the connected components of @xmath46 partition the @xmath2 vertices of a layer , where @xmath47 is the intersection of @xmath48 with the set of edges which are _ below _ the layer under consideration . for instance , when @xmath49 , the five possible states are the partitions @xmath50 we shall see shortly how the information contained in these states permits us to account for the non - locality of the boltzmann weight @xmath51 .",
    "our objective is to write the chromatic polynomial on a rectangular piece , of width @xmath2 and height @xmath52 , of the square or triangular lattice in the form @xmath53 where the basis state @xmath54 corresponds to the all - singleton partition @xmath55 .",
    "each transfer matrix @xmath16 adds one layer to the lattice , consisting of @xmath56 horizontal edges and @xmath2 vertical edges  and for the triangular lattice also @xmath56 diagonal edges .",
    "a special matrix @xmath57 will be required to deal with the last layer of @xmath56 horizontal edges .",
    "the notation @xmath58 means projection on the all - singleton state , and is not meant to imply the definition of a scalar product on the space of partitions ( although such a scalar product can indeed be defined ) .",
    "let us observe that it would be quite wasteful to construct the matrix @xmath16 explicitly . not only",
    "would this require memory resources of the order of @xmath59 for its storage , but computing the product @xmath60 , where @xmath61 represents an arbitrary linear combination of all possible basis states , would take a time proportional to @xmath59 . if , on the other hand , we write @xmath16 as a product of matrices each corresponding to the addition of a single edge , these matrices will turn out to be _ sparse _ ( with only one or two non - zero entries per column ) , and so both time and memory requirements are _ linear _ in the dimension of these matrices . in order to proceed ,",
    "we first study these single - edge matrices in some detail .",
    "since we are going to construct a series expansion in powers of @xmath18 , it will be useful to pull out a trivial factor in ( [ z2 ] ) and study instead @xmath62 the lowest - order term , corresponding to @xmath63 , is then @xmath64 .",
    "it is useful to think of the factor @xmath65 in the following way : whenever the addition of an edge to the set @xmath48 joins up two connected component the result is a factor of @xmath44 .",
    "the single - edge transfer matrix that adds a horizontal edge between vertices @xmath66 and @xmath67 can now be written @xmath68 where the first ( resp .",
    "second ) term represents the possibility of that edge being absent from ( resp .  present in ) the subset @xmath48 .",
    "the join operator @xmath69 acts on a partition of @xmath45 as the identity if @xmath66 and @xmath67 belong to the same block .",
    "if they belong to two different blocks , the action of @xmath69 is to join up the blocks and attribute a factor @xmath44 .",
    "we now make a remark that will turn out to be very important in what follows . for the case of the chromatic polynomial (",
    "i.e. , @xmath42 ) @xmath70 is idempotent .",
    "it projects out states in which @xmath66 and @xmath67 belong to the same block .",
    "it turns out useful to introduce the normalised projection operator @xmath71 which acts on a partition as the identity if @xmath66 and @xmath67 belong to different blocks , and as zero if @xmath66 and @xmath67 are in the same block .",
    "we have then @xmath72    the transfer matrix corresponding to a vertical edge between vertices @xmath66 and @xmath73 can be thought of as the following sequence of operations :    1 .",
    "insert @xmath73 into the partition as a singleton .",
    "2 .   apply @xmath74 .",
    "3 .   eliminate @xmath66 from the partition .",
    "4 .   relabel @xmath73 as @xmath66 .    alternatively , the vertical edge as can be represented as the operator @xmath75 where the first ( resp .",
    "second ) term represents the situation where that edge is present in ( resp .",
    "absent from ) the subset @xmath48 .",
    "the detach operator @xmath76 acts by transforming @xmath66 into a singleton .",
    "the advantage of the rewriting is that the relabelling @xmath77 is done automatically , but one should keep in mind that @xmath66 does _ not _ represent the same vertex on the lattice before and after the action of @xmath78 .",
    "note that although the vertical - edge transfer matrix @xmath78 is related to @xmath74 , it is not a projector in the chromatic case @xmath42 .",
    "we next show how to combine the observation that @xmath79 is a projector with the sparse matrix decomposition of @xmath16 in order to achieve a very efficient transfer matrix formalism .",
    "although this can be done for any regular lattice , we shall discuss only the cases of the square and triangular lattices .",
    "one can use the operators @xmath79 and @xmath78 to build up the lattice , by writing @xmath16 as a suitable product of such operators .",
    "an obvious construction is to first lay down all the horizontal edges of a layer , and the add all vertical edges that connect to the next layer : @xmath80 since the next transfer matrix in the product ( [ z_from_t ] ) will first lay down a row of horizontal edges , we may use ( [ projector ] ) and write instead , for @xmath42 , @xmath81 although the construction ( [ t_as_pvh ] ) takes advantage of the sparse matrix decomposition , it is not maximally efficient for reasons that we now point out .    consider first the case of generic @xmath82 .",
    "successive applications of @xmath16 to @xmath54 , as in ( [ z_from_t ] ) , will generate a number of basis states corresponding to all possible partitions of @xmath45 that are consistent with planarity .",
    "these are known in the literature as non - crossing partitions , and their number is given by the catalan number @xmath83 which grows asymptotically as @xmath84 for @xmath85 .    for @xmath42 we can use ( [ t_as_pvh ] ) , and",
    "so once a layer is completed the number of basis states equals the number of non - crossing non - nearest - neighbour partitions of @xmath45 .",
    "their number is given @xcite by the motzkin number @xmath86 , where @xmath87 for instance , when @xmath88 , the four possible such partitions read @xmath89 the asymptotic behaviour is now @xmath90 for @xmath91 .",
    "this looks like a considerable improvement .",
    "however , the intermediate stages that appear when building up the product ( [ t_as_pvh ] ) still require all nearest - neighbour partitions , and so the time necessary for a complete multiplication with @xmath16 still grows like @xmath92 .    fortunately , we can write the sparse matrix decomposition of @xmath16 in a way which ( essentially ) only makes use of non - crossing non - nearest - neighbour partitions . this is accomplished by utilising the property ( [ projector ] ) maximally .",
    "indeed we can write , for @xmath42 , @xmath93 with @xmath94 after the multiplication by @xmath95 , the non - nearest - neighbour constraint is now in action everywhere , except possibly between sites @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the number of partitions where @xmath66 and @xmath67 do belong to the same block is @xmath96 , since for such partitions the contraction of @xmath66 and @xmath67 into a single point clearly leads to a non - crossing non - nearest - neighbour partition on @xmath56 points .",
    "the sparse - matrix factorisation ( [ t_sq_decomp])([t_sq_proj ] ) is a central result of this paper .",
    "it implies that , for the square lattice , the number of basis states needed to compute the chromatic polynomial using ( [ z_from_t ] ) and ( [ t_sq_decomp ] ) is @xmath86 when a layer has just been completed , and @xmath97 in the intermediate stages .",
    "both numbers grow like @xmath98 .",
    "it remains to describe how the matrix @xmath57 lays down the last layer of horizontal edges . as before this",
    "is done one edge at a time @xmath99 in this product , each factor adds a horizontal bond between @xmath66 and @xmath67 . having done that , vertex @xmath66 and those to the left of it are of no use any longer , so we might as well detach them as singletons .",
    "this leads to @xmath100 note that after the action of @xmath57 , only the all - singleton state @xmath54 remains .",
    "the chromatic polynomial of @xmath5 appears as the coefficient of this state , leading finally to ( [ z_from_t ] ) .",
    "the triangular lattice can be drawn as a square lattice with diagonals .",
    "these diagonals can be constructed , within the transfer matrix approach , by applying the operators @xmath79 just after site @xmath66 has been propagated from one layer to the next by means of @xmath78 , but before @xmath101 has been employed .",
    "we have again the factorisation ( [ t_sq_decomp ] ) , but now with @xmath102 note that , due to the existence of the diagonal edges , the leftmost factor in each expression is the product over _ all _ nearest - neighbour projectors .",
    "therefore , the number of basis states required in any intermediate stage of the construction is @xmath86 .",
    "the expressions ( [ t_last])([t_last_i ] ) for @xmath57 are identical to those for the square lattice .      at this point",
    ", one would be ready to write a transfer matrix for the chromatic polynomial using only non - crossing non - nearest - neighbour ( ncnnn ) partitions up to a small subtlety for the square lattice  as intermediate states , by storing the partitions encountered using standard hashing techniques .",
    "one can however reduce further  albeit only by a constant factor  time and memory requirements by establishing a bijection between the natural numbers @xmath103 and the set of @xmath86 ncnnn partitions . using this , the vectors appearing in the computation of ( [ z_from_t ] )",
    "can be realised simply as standard arrays , indexed by the natural numbers , and each basis state can be mapped back and forth between its representation as a natural number and as a partition on which the operators @xmath79 , @xmath104 and @xmath71 can be made to act .",
    "this idea was previously implemented in the context of the planar potts model ( i.e. , for non - crossing partitions ) by blte and nightingale @xcite , and we extend it here by adding the non - nearest - neighbour constraint .    an important step in establishing",
    "the bijection is to produce an ordering of the ncnnn partitions for a given @xmath2 . to this end , consider the first point in the partition .",
    "two situations may arise :    1 .",
    "if point 1 is a singleton , the restriction of the partition to the points @xmath105 is again ncnnn .",
    "2 .   if point 1 is not a singleton , let @xmath106 be the _",
    "smallest _ integer so that point @xmath107 belongs to the same block as 1 .",
    "then the restriction of the partition to points @xmath108 and the restriction to points @xmath109 are two independent ncnnn partitions of respectively @xmath110 and @xmath111 points .",
    "this argument proves in particular the recursion formula ( with @xmath112 ) @xmath113 with initial values @xmath114 .",
    "suppose now , as an induction hypotheses , that we have defined an ordering of ncnnn partitions of fewer than @xmath2 points .",
    "the ordering of ncnnn partitions of 1 or 2 points is trivial , since in these cases there is only one such partition .",
    "we can then order ncnnn partitions of @xmath2 points as follows :    1 .",
    "place first the partitions in which point 1 is a singleton .",
    "the ordering of these partitions follows inductively from the ordering of the partitions of points @xmath105 .",
    "place next the partitions in which point 1 is not a singleton , in the order of increasing values of the integer @xmath115 defined above .",
    "the ordering of the partitions with a fixed value of @xmath115 follows inductively from the ordering of the partitions of points @xmath108 and @xmath109 , using the former ( resp .",
    "latter ) as the most ( resp .",
    "least ) significant ` bit ' .",
    "for instance , the ordering for @xmath116 points reads : +    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     the results for all three series are given in table  [ tab : sq ] .",
    "they extend those of @xcite by 32 new terms .",
    "it is possible to analyse the extended series using the method of differential approximants .",
    "the goal is to obtain the locations @xmath117 and exponents @xmath118 of the singularities of the free - energy series , which is supposed to behave like @xmath119 as @xmath120 .",
    "proceeding exactly as described in section 5.5.3 of @xcite , one obtains for the bulk free energy the first - order ( @xmath121 ) approximants @xmath122 while the second - order ( @xmath123 ) approximants read @xmath124 somewhat disappointingly , these results hardly improve on those reported in @xcite , despite of the substantial extensions of the series .",
    "the same is true for the reanalysis of the surface and corner free energies .      for the triangular lattice",
    ", we can use exactly the same finite - lattice weights as for the square lattice .",
    "taking again @xmath125 and @xmath126 corresponds to a maximum dimension of the transfer matrices of @xmath127 .",
    "the error term in ( [ fb])([fc ] ) is now @xmath128 , and we know of no special tricks for obtaining an extra term .",
    "therefore , we obtain in this case the three series to order @xmath129 included .    in a couple of important papers , baxter @xcite",
    "has shown that the triangular - lattice chromatic polynomial is an integrable system .",
    "in particular , he has set up the bethe ansatz equations and derived three different analytical expressions for the bulk free energy @xmath130 . the question which one of the three expressions dominates for a given real  or even complex ",
    "value of @xmath0 turns out to be very intricate @xcite , and has recently been the subject of a careful reanalysis @xcite .",
    "the expression which is dominant for real @xmath22 \\cup [ 4,\\infty)$ ] turns out to be @xmath131 where the previous expansion variable ( [ def_z ] ) has now been traded for @xmath132 which is defined by @xmath133 as expected , our series expansion validates ( [ efb ] ) to order @xmath134 included .",
    "the analytic computation of @xmath135 and @xmath136 was not attempted in @xcite .",
    "presumably @xmath135 could be derived by a substantial adaptation of baxter s work in order to impose non - periodic boundary conditions in his transfer matrix formalism . on the other hand , the derivation of @xmath136 appears to be a much harder problem , since this would require precise knowledge of the correspondence between boundary states in the bethe setup and the initial lattice model , as well as the ability to compute scalar products in the bethe formalism .",
    "the series expansions that we obtain for @xmath135 and @xmath136 read as follows @xmath137 it is seen that the coefficients are numerically much smaller than those for the square lattice ( see table  [ tab : sq ] ) .",
    "this in itself is not surprising , since the radius of convergence is @xmath64 in the @xmath132 variable ( triangular - lattice case ) , while that of the @xmath138 variable ( square - lattice case ) is @xmath139 ( and presumably exactly @xmath140 in view of @xcite ) .",
    "what is truly surprising is that the coefficients are integers !",
    "it thus looks reasonable to try to conjecture exact expressions .    in analogy with other problems where both bulk and surface properties have been worked out , one would expect the periodicity of 6 in the product formula ( [ efb ] ) to be doubled to 12 in the corresponding surface quantities . taking this as a clue suggests trying for @xmath141 and @xmath142 product formulae of the form @xmath143 for some exponents @xmath144 to be determined .",
    "knowledge of the coefficients of @xmath145 from ( [ efs_ser])([efc_ser ] ) allows us to determine @xmath146 ; we can then test our conjectural formula against the coefficients of @xmath147 .    in this way we have obtained the conjecture @xmath148 for the surface free energy , and @xmath149 for the corner free energy .",
    "the validation of ( [ efs])([efc ] ) by @xmath150 independent checks means that both conjectures are established beyond any reasonable doubt .",
    "it is obvious that the product formulae ( [ efb ] ) , ( [ efs ] ) and ( [ efc ] ) converge for @xmath153 , since this is true for each individual factor in the product ( by taking logarithms ) .",
    "it remains to discuss the limiting cases @xmath154 ( i.e. , @xmath151 ) and @xmath155 ( i.e. , @xmath152 ) .",
    "the latter case  four - colouring the vertices of the triangular lattice  can be shown to be equivalent to other physically interesting problems , such as three - colouring the edges of the hexagonal lattice @xcite , or fully - packed loops on the hexagonal lattice with fugacity @xmath156 @xcite .    in the @xmath154 case , we write @xmath157 for @xmath158 . then , to leading order , we have for each factor in the products @xmath159 .",

    "\\lim_{x \\to -1 } { \\rm e}^{f_{\\rm c } } & = & \\infty \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is remarkable that @xmath136 diverges in both limits @xmath167 .",
    "in this paper we have used the finite - lattice method to obtain large-@xmath0 series for the bulk , surface and corner free energies  denoted @xmath130 , @xmath135 and @xmath136for chromatic polynomials on regular two - dimensional lattices .",
    "long series could be obtained due to a technical improvement of the transfer matrix method , which is specific to the antiferromagnetic zero - temperature limit of the potts model , and amounts to obtaining a factorisation of @xmath16 in terms of sparse matrices , each of dimension @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the strip width .",
    "although this applies in principle to any regular lattice , we have focussed here on the most commonly studied lattices ( square and triangular ) .    for the square lattice the improvement allowed us to add 32 new terms to the existing series @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the reanalysis of the singularities of this series , using the method of differential approximants , did not lead to any significant improvement over @xcite .",
    "the focus in this paper was therefore rather on the triangular lattice , where the series permitted us to conjecture the exact analytical formulae ( [ efs])([efc ] ) for @xmath135 and @xmath136 , and to confirm the correctness of baxter s @xcite result ( [ efb ] ) for @xmath130 .",
    "it should be noticed that going to @xmath168 leads to @xmath169 terms in the square - lattice series , but only to @xmath170 terms for the triangular lattice .",
    "longer series could be obtained in the latter case by using a version of the finite - lattice method which is specifically adapted to the triangular lattice @xcite . however , since our series have enabled us to conjecture the exact ( infinite - order ) results ( [ efs])([efc ] ) the motivation for extracting further terms of the series is admittedly rather scarce .",
    "indeed , the series reported here already provide @xmath150 independent checks of the proposed expressions ( [ efs])([efc ] )",
    ".    it would be interesting to elucidate the physical mechanism by which @xmath136 diverges in the limits @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "it is regrettable that the series obtained here do not provide any information about the regions where the chromatic polynomial is a critical system  that is , @xmath171 $ ] for the square lattice @xcite and @xmath172 $ ] for the triangular lattice @xcite .",
    "the reason is that @xmath173 seems to be the only viable expansion point for the finite - lattice method .",
    "it is possible that the fact that non - nearest neighbour constraint can be made local conceals some deeper representation theoretical meaning .",
    "it is well - known that the generic representation theory of the temperley - lieb algebra , which is central to the algebraic formulation of the planar potts model , undergoes profound modifications when @xmath174 with @xmath175 integer ( or rational ) @xcite .",
    "it might be that similar modifications occur upon taking the particular value @xmath42 for the temperature variable .",
    "it should be noticed that some steps toward an algebraic formulation of the chromatic polynomial have been taken in @xcite .",

    "<S> , we obtain the large-@xmath0 series of the bulk , surface and corner free energies of the chromatic polynomial . </S>",
    "<S> this extends the existing series for the square lattice by 32 terms , to order @xmath3 . on the triangular lattice , </S>",
    "<S> we verify baxter s analytical expression for the bulk free energy ( to order @xmath4 ) , and we are able to conjecture exact product formulae for the surface and corner free energies . </S>"
