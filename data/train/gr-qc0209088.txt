    "the ( i ) existence of the principle of equivalence and ( ii ) the connection between gravity and thermodynamics are the two most surprising features of gravity . among these two ,",
    "the principle of equivalence finds its natural expression when gravity is described as a manifestation of curved spacetime .",
    "this  in turn  makes gravity the only interaction which is capable of wrapping up regions of spacetime so that information from one region is not accessible to observers at another region",
    ". given the fact that entropy of a system is closely related to accessibility of information , it is inevitable that there will be some connection between gravity and thermodynamics ( for a review , see references @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "but , in contrast to the principle of equivalence , years of research in this field ( see , for a sample of references @xcite ) , has not led to something more profound or fundamental arising out of this feature .",
    "this suggests that we should learn a lesson from the way einstein handled the principle of equivalence and apply it in the context of the connection between thermodynamics and gravity .",
    "einstein did not attempt to  derive \" principle of equivalence in the conventional sense of the word .",
    "rather , he accepted it as a key feature which must find expression in the way gravity is described  thereby obtaining a geometrical description of gravity .",
    "once the geometrical interpretation of gravity is accepted , it follows that there _ will _ arise surfaces which act as one - way - membranes for information and will thus lead to some connection with thermodynamics .",
    "it is , therefore , more in tune with the spirit of einstein s analysis to _ accept _ an inevitable connection between gravity and thermodynamics and ask what such a connection would imply .",
    "i will now elaborate this idea further in order to show how powerful it is @xcite .",
    "the first step in the logic , the principle of equivalence , allows one to define a coordinate system around any event @xmath0 in a region of size @xmath1 ( with @xmath2 but @xmath3 being arbitrary ) in which the spacetime is locally inertial . as the second step , we want to give expression to the fact that there is a deep connection between one - way - membranes arising in a spacetime and thermodynamical entropy .",
    "this , of course , is not possible in the local inertial frame since the quantum field theory in that frame , say , does not recognize any non trivial geometry of spacetime .",
    "but it is possible to achieve our aim by using a uniformly accelerated frame around @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , around any event @xmath0 we have fiducial observers anchored firmly in space with @xmath4 constant and the four - velocity @xmath5 and acceleration @xmath6 .",
    "this allows us to define a second natural coordinate system around any event by using the fermi - walker transported coordinates corresponding to these accelerated observers .",
    "i shall call this the local rindler frame . [ operationally , this coordinate system is most easily constructed by first transforming to the locally inertial frame and then using the standard transformations between the inertial coordinates and the rindler coordinates . ]",
    "this local rindler frame will lead to a natural notion of horizon and associated temperature .",
    "the key new idea will be to postulate that the horizon in the local rindler frame also has an entropy per unit transverse area and demand that any description of gravity must have this feature incorporated in it .    what will such a postulate lead to ?",
    "incredibly enough , it leads to the _ correct einstein - hilbert action principle _ for gravity . note that the original approach of einstein making use of the principle of equivalence lead only up to the _ kinematics _ of gravity  viz . , that gravity is described by a curved spacetime with a non trivial metric @xmath7  and can not tell us how the _ dynamics _ of the spacetime is determined .",
    "taking the next step , using the local rindler frame and demanding that gravity must incorporate the thermodynamical aspects lead to the action functional itself .",
    "this approach also throws light on ( what has been usually considered ) a completely different issue : why does the einstein - hilbert action contain second derivatives of the metric tensor ?",
    "the new approach `` builds up '' the einstein - hilbert action from its surface behaviour and , in this sense , shows that gravity is intrinsically holographic @xcite .",
    "i use this term with the specific meaning that given the form of the action on a two dimensional surface , there is a way of obtaining the full bulk action . in the @xmath8 formalism , this leads to the interpretation of the gravitational action as the free energy of spacetime .",
    "einstein s equations are equivalent to the principle of minimization of free energy in thermodynamics .",
    "the principle of equivalence leads to a geometrical description of gravity in which @xmath7 are the fundamental variables .",
    "so we expect the dynamics of gravity to be described by some _ unknown _ action functional @xmath9 involving @xmath7s and their first derivatives @xmath10 or , equivalently , the set @xmath11 $ ] where @xmath12s are the standard christoffel symbols .",
    "given any lagrangian @xmath13 involving only up to the first derivatives of the dynamical variables , it is _ always _ possible to construct another lagrangian @xmath14 , involving second derivatives such that it describes the same dynamics @xcite .",
    "this idea works for any number of variables ( so that @xmath15 can be a multicomponent entity ) dependent on space and time .",
    "but i shall illustrate it in the context of point mechanics .",
    "the prescription is : @xmath16 while varying the @xmath17 , one keeps the _ momenta _ @xmath18 fixed at the endpoints rather than @xmath19s . this is most easily seen by explicit variation ; we have @xmath20 - \\delta \\left (   q { \\partial l \\over \\partial \\dot q } \\right ) \\bigg \\vert^{{\\cal p}_2}_{{\\cal p}_1}\\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\int\\limits^{{\\cal p}_2}_{{\\cal p}_1 }   dt \\left [ { \\partial l \\over \\partial   q } - { d \\over dt } \\left (   { \\partial l \\over \\partial \\dot q } \\right ) \\right ] \\delta q - q \\delta p \\bigg \\vert^{{\\cal p}_2}_{{\\cal p}_1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we keep @xmath21 at the end points while varying @xmath17 , then we get back the same euler - lagrange equations as obtained by varying @xmath1 and keeping @xmath22 at end points",
    ". since @xmath23 , the quantity @xmath24 will also depend on @xmath25 and the term @xmath26 will involve @xmath27 . thus @xmath17 contains second derivatives of @xmath28 while @xmath1 contains only up to first derivatives . in spite of the fact that @xmath17 contains second derivatives of @xmath28 , the equations of motion arising from @xmath17 are only second order for variation with @xmath29 at end points .",
    "it can be shown that , in the path integral formulation of quantum theory , the modified lagrangian @xmath17 correctly describes the transition amplitude between states with given momenta ( see p. 170 of @xcite ) .",
    "thus , in the case of gravity , the _ same _ equations of motion can be obtained from another ( as yet unknown ) action : @xmath30   \\nonumber \\\\     & \\equiv &   a - \\int d^4 x \\partial_c ( \\sqrt{-g}v^c ) \\equiv a - \\int d^4 x \\partial_c p^c       \\label{aeh }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is made of @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "further , @xmath34 must be linear in the @xmath12 s since the original lagrangian @xmath1 was quadratic in the first derivatives of the metric .",
    "since @xmath12s vanish in the local inertial frame and the metric reduces to the lorentzian form , the action @xmath35 can not be generally covariant .",
    "however , the action @xmath36 involves the second derivatives of the metric and we shall see later that that the action @xmath36 is indeed generally covariant .    to obtain a quantity @xmath34 , which is linear in @xmath12s and having a single index @xmath37 , from @xmath32 and @xmath33 , we must contract on two of the indices on @xmath12 using the metric tensor .",
    "( note that we require @xmath35 , @xmath36 etc . to be lorentz scalars and @xmath38 etc . to be vectors under lorentz transformation . )",
    "hence the most general choice for @xmath34 is the linear combination @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are unknown functions of the determinant @xmath42 of the metric ( which is the only ( pseudo ) scalar entity which can be constructed from @xmath7s and @xmath33s ) . using the identities @xmath43 ,  @xmath44",
    ", we can rewrite the expression for @xmath45 as @xmath46 where @xmath47 are two other unknown functions of @xmath42 .",
    "if we can fix these coefficients by using a physically well motivated prescription , then we can determine the surface term and by integrating , the lagrangian @xmath1 .",
    "i will now show how this can be done .",
    "let us consider a static spacetime in which all @xmath7s are independent of @xmath48 and @xmath49 . around",
    "any given event @xmath0 one can construct a local rindler frame with an acceleration of the observers with @xmath50 = constant , given by @xmath51 and @xmath52 . this rindler frame will have a horizon which is a plane surface normal to the direction of acceleration and a temperature @xmath53 associated with this horizon .",
    "i shall postulate that the entropy associated with this horizon is proportional to its area or , more precisely , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a fundamental constant with the dimensions of area .",
    "it represents the minimum area required to hold unit amount of information and our postulate demands that this number be finite .",
    "given the temperature of the horizon , one can construct a canonical ensemble with this temperature and relate the euclidean action to the thermodynamic entropy ( see , e.g , @xcite @xcite ) . since the euclidean action can be interpreted as the entropy in the canonical ensemble , i will demand that the surface term in equation ( [ aeh ] ) should be related to the entropy @xmath56 by @xmath57 ( with the minus sign arising from standard euclidean continuation @xcite ) , when evaluated in the local rindler frame with the temperature @xmath58 .",
    "in particular , this result must hold in flat spacetime in rindler coordinates .",
    "[ we will see later that the action @xmath36 is generally covariant and will vanish in the flat spacetime , in the absence of the cosmological constant .",
    "it follows that the numerical value of the action @xmath35 in the rindler frame is the same as the surface term in equation ( [ aeh ] ) .",
    "] in the static rindler frame , the surface term is @xmath59 i have restricted the time integration to an interval @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the inverse temperature in the rindler frame",
    ". this is _ needed _ since the euclidean action will be periodic in the imaginary time with the period @xmath62 .",
    "we shall choose the rindler frame such that the acceleration is along the @xmath63 axis .",
    "the most general form of the metric representing the rindler frame can be expressed in the form @xmath64dt^2 - \\frac{l^{'2}}{[1 + 2al(x)]}dx^2 - ( dy^2+dz^2 )    \\label{rindmetric }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is an arbitrary function and @xmath66 .",
    "[ since the acceleration is along the x - axis , the metric in the transverse direction is unaffected .",
    "the first form of the metric is the standard rindler frame in the @xmath67 coordinates .",
    "we can , however , make any coordinate transformation from @xmath68 to some other variable @xmath69 without affecting the planar symmetry or the static nature of the metric .",
    "this leads to the general form of the metric given in the second line , in terms of the @xmath70 coordinates . ]",
    "evaluating the surface term @xmath71 in ( [ defpc ] ) for this metric , we get the only non zero component to be @xmath72 \\frac{l''}{l^{'2 } } [ c_1(g)- 2 c_2(g)]\\ ] ] so that the action in ( [ keyeqn ] ) becomes @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the transverse area of the @xmath75 plane .",
    "the last equality identifies the entropy @xmath56 , which is equal the euclidean action , with the minus sign arising from standard euclidean continuation . from our postulate ( [ postulate ] )",
    "it follows that @xmath76 ( 1 + 2al ) \\frac{l''}{l^{'2 } } = \\frac{1}{{\\cal a}_p }       \\label{xxx}\\ ] ] for this quantity to be a constant independent of @xmath69 for any choice of @xmath65 , the second term must vanish requiring @xmath77 .",
    "an explicit way of obtaining this result is to consider a class of functions @xmath65 which satisfy the relation @xmath78 with @xmath79 . then @xmath80 ( 1 + 2al ) \\frac{l''}{l^{'2}}=2a\\beta [ c_1(l ' ) - 2 c_2(l')]n\\ ] ] which can be independent of @xmath81 and @xmath69 only if @xmath77 .",
    "further , using @xmath82 , we find that @xmath83 which is a constant independent of @xmath42 .",
    "hence @xmath71 has the form @xmath84 the second equality is obtained by using the standard identities mentioned after equation ( [ defvc ] ) while the third equality follows directly by combining the two terms in the first expression .",
    "this result is remarkable and let me discuss it before proceeding further .",
    "the general form of @xmath71 which we obtained in ( [ defpc ] ) is not of any use unless we can fix @xmath85 . for static configurations",
    ", we can convert the extra term to an integral over time and a two - dimensional spatial surface .",
    "this is true for any system , but in general , the result will not have any simple form and will involve an undetermined range of integration over time coordinate .",
    "but in the case of gravity , two natural features conspire together to give an elegant form to this surface term .",
    "first is the fact that rindler frame has a periodicity in euclidean time and the range of integration over the time coordinate is naturally restricted to the interval @xmath86 .",
    "the second is the fact that the surviving term in the integrand @xmath71 is linear in the acceleration @xmath87 thereby neatly canceling with the @xmath88 factor arising from time integration .",
    "[ i will discuss these features more in section ( [ ehaction ] ) . ]    given the form of @xmath71 we need to solve the equation @xmath89 to obtain the first order lagrangian density .",
    "it is straightforward to show @xcite that this equation is satisfied by the lagrangian @xmath90 this is the second surprise .",
    "the lagrangian which we have obtained is precisely the first order dirac - schrodinger lagrangian for gravity ( usually called the @xmath91 lagrangian ) .",
    "note that we have obtained it without introducing the curvature tensor anywhere in the picture . once again",
    ", this is unlikely to be a mere accident .",
    "given the two pieces , the final second order lagrangian follows from our equation ( [ aeh ] ) and is , of course , the standard einstein - hilbert lagrangian .",
    "@xmath92 thus our full second order lagrangian _ turns out _ to be the standard einstein - hilbert lagrangian .",
    "we have obtained this result by just postulating that the surface term in the action should be proportional to the entropy per unit area .",
    "this postulate uniquely determines the gravitational action principle and gives rise to a generally covariant action .",
    "the surface terms dictate the form of the einstein lagrangian in the bulk .",
    "the idea that surface areas encode bits of information per quantum of area allows one to determine the nature of gravitational interaction on the bulk , which is an interesting realization of the holographic principle .",
    "i stress the fact that there is a very peculiar identity connecting the @xmath91 lagrangian @xmath1 and the einstein - hilbert lagrangian @xmath93 , encoded in equation ( [ lgrav ] ) .",
    "this relation , which is purely a differential geometric identity , can be stated through the equations : @xmath94 ; \\quad l = l_{grav}-\\nabla_c\\left [ \\gamma^j_{ab }       { \\partial   l_{grav } \\over \\partial(\\partial_c \\gamma^j_{ab } ) }      \\right ]      \\label{lageh}\\ ] ] this relationship between the three terms defies any simple explanation in conventional approaches to gravity but arises very naturally in the approach presented here .",
    "the solution to ( [ dseq ] ) obtained in ( [ ds ] ) is not unique .",
    "however , self consistency requires that the final equations of motion for gravity must admit the line element in ( [ rindmetric ] ) as a solution . it can be shown . by fairly detailed algebra , that this condition makes the lagrangian in ( [ dseq ] ) to be the only solution .",
    "in particular , since we are demanding the flat spacetime to be a solution to the field equations , the cosmological constant in the pure gravity sector must be zero .",
    "[ this , of course , does not prevent a cosmological constant arising from the matter sector of the theory . ]",
    "the approach leads to new insights regarding the peculiar structure of einstein - hilbert and the @xmath8 formalism of gravity . to discuss these features ,",
    "it is convenient to temporarily switch to the signature @xmath95 so that the spatial metric is positive definite .",
    "we will foliate the spacetime by a series of space like hyper - surfaces @xmath96 with @xmath97 as normal ; then @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the induced metric on @xmath100 . from the covariant derivative @xmath101 of the normals to @xmath100 , one can construct only three vectors @xmath102 which are linear in covariant derivative operator .",
    "the first one is the acceleration @xmath103 ; the second identically vanishes since @xmath104 has unit norm ; the third , @xmath105 , is proportional to the trace of the extrinsic curvature @xmath106 of @xmath100 .",
    "thus @xmath107 in the surface term in equation ( [ aeh ] ) must be a linear combination of @xmath105 and @xmath108 .",
    "in fact , one can show that ( see , e.g. equation ( 21.88 ) of the first reference in @xcite ) @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the adm lagrangian . to prove this",
    ", we begin with the relation @xmath111 and rewrite the first term using the identity : @xmath112 as for the second term in ( [ rinhone ] ) , we note that @xmath113 giving @xmath114 using ( [ rabcd ] ) and ( [ ginr ] ) we can rewrite ( [ rinhone ] ) in the form of ( [ rinh ] ) .",
    "let us now use ( [ rinh ] ) to integrate @xmath115 over a four volume @xmath116 bounded by two space - like surfaces @xmath117 and @xmath118 ( with normals @xmath97 ) and two time - like surfaces @xmath119 and @xmath120 ( with normals @xmath121 ) .",
    "the induced metric on the space - like surface @xmath96 is @xmath122 while the metric on the time - like surface @xmath123 is @xmath124 .",
    "these two surfaces will intersect on a two - dimensional surface @xmath125 on which the metric is @xmath126 . integrating both sides of ( [ rinh ] ) over @xmath116",
    "we now get @xmath127 where @xmath128 . in a static spacetime with a horizon : ( i ) @xmath129 making the second term on the right hand side vanish .",
    "( ii ) the integration over @xmath130 becomes multiplication by @xmath62 .",
    "( iii ) further , as the surface @xmath119 approaches the horizon , the quantity @xmath131 tends to @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the surface gravity of the horizon , which is constant over the horizon .",
    "using @xmath134 , the last term gives , on the horizon , the contribution @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the area of the horizon . in the euclidean sector",
    "the first term gives @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the integral of the adm hamiltonian over the spatial volume .",
    "we thus get the result @xmath139 which is the free energy . for any static spacetime geometry , having a periodicity @xmath62 in the euclidean time , the euclidean gravitational action represents the free energy of the spacetime ; the first order term gives the hamiltonian and the surface term gives the entropy .",
    "more generally , the analysis suggests a remarkably simple , thermodynamical , interpretation of semiclassical gravity . in any static spacetime with a metric @xmath140",
    "we have @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the acceleration of @xmath4 constant world lines .",
    "then , limiting the time integration to @xmath60 , say , the einstein - hilbert action becomes @xmath143 where the first term is proportional to energy ( in the sense of spatial integral of adm hamiltonian ) and the second term is proportional to entropy in the presence of horizon .",
    "the variation of this action  which leads to einstein s equation  is equivalent to the thermodynamic identity .",
    "( this result is explored in detail for spherically symmetric spacetimes in @xcite ) .",
    "the surfaces @xmath144 as well as the two surface @xmath125 on which they intersect will have corresponding extrinsic curvatures @xmath145 and @xmath146 . in the literature ,",
    "it is conventional to write the einstein - hilbert action as a term having only the first derivatives , plus an integral over the trace of the extrinsic curvature of the bounding surfaces .",
    "it is easy to obtain this form using the foliation condition @xmath147 between the surfaces and noting : @xmath148 where @xmath149 and @xmath150 are the traces of the extrinsic curvature of the 2-surface when treated as embedded in the 4-dimensional or 3-dimensional enveloping manifolds . using ( [ thetaink ] ) to replace @xmath151 ) in the last term of ( [ bigeqn ] ) , we get the result @xmath152 in the first term on the right hand side , the adm lagrangian @xmath110 contains @xmath153 which in turn involves the second derivatives of the metric tensor .",
    "the second term on the right hand side removes these second derivatives making the right hand side equal to the quadratic @xmath91 action for gravity . on the left hand side ,",
    "the second and third terms are the integrals of the extrinsic curvatures over the boundary surfaces which , when added to the einstein - hilbert action gives the quadratic action without second derivatives .",
    "( this is the standard result often used in the literature ) .",
    "unfortunately , this form replaces the normal component of the acceleration @xmath154 in ( [ bigeqn ] ) by @xmath155 and combines @xmath28 with @xmath153 to get the first order lagrangian . in the process",
    ", the normal component of the acceleration disappears and we miss the nice interpretation of einstein - hilbert action as the free energy of spacetime .",
    "the approach adopted here is a natural extension of the original philosophy of einstein ; viz . , to use non inertial frames judiciously to understand the behaviour of gravity . in the original approach ,",
    "einstein used the principle of equivalence which leads naturally to the description of gravity in terms of the metric tensor . unfortunately , _ classical _ principle of equivalence can not take us any further since it does not encode information about the curvature of spacetime .",
    "however , the true world is quantum mechanical and one would like to pursue the analogy between non inertial frames and gravitational field into the quantum domain . here the local rindler frame arises as the natural extension of the local inertial frame and the study of the thermodynamics of the horizon shows a way of combining special relativity , quantum theory and physics in the non inertial frame .",
    "i have shown that these components are adequate to determine the action functional for gravity and , in fact , leads to the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "this is remarkable because we did not introduce the curvature of spacetime explicitly into the discussion and  in fact  the analysis was done in a rindler frame which is just flat spacetime .",
    "the idea works because the action for gravity splits up into two natural parts _ neither _ of which is generally covariant but are related to each other by the remarkable identity ( [ lageh ] ) which  as far as i know  was not noticed before .",
    "the sum of the two parts is generally covariant but the expression for individual parts can be ascertained in the local rindler frame specifically because these parts are _ not _ generally covariant .",
    "the fundamental postulate we use is in equation ( [ postulate ] ) and it does _ not _ refer to any horizon . to see how this comes about , consider any spatial plane ,",
    "say the @xmath156 plane , in flat spacetime .",
    "it is always possible to find a rindler frame in the flat spacetime such that the chosen surface acts as the horizon for some rindler observer . in this sense ,",
    "any plane in flat spacetime must have an entropy per unit area .",
    "microscopically , i would expect this to arise because of the entanglement over length scales of the order of @xmath157 .",
    "we have defined in ( [ postulate ] ) the entropy per unit area rather than the total entropy in order to avoid having to deal with global nature of the surfaces ( whether the surface is compact , non compact etc . ) .",
    "this approach also provides a natural explanation as to why the gravitational coupling constant is positive .",
    "it is positive because entropy and area are positive quantities .",
    "the result emphasizes the role of two dimensional surfaces in fundamental physics .",
    "a two dimensional surface is the basic minimum one needs to produce region of inaccessibility and thus entropy from lack of information .",
    "when one connects up gravity with spacetime entropy it is is inevitable that the coupling constant for gravity has the dimensions of area in natural units .",
    "the next step in such an approach will be to find the fundamental units by which spacetime areas are made of and provide a theoretical , quantum mechanical description for the same .",
    "this will lead to the proper quantum description of spacetime with einstein action playing the role of the free energy in the thermodynamic limit of the spacetime .",
