    "the origin of the electroweak symmetry breaking , a fundamental mystery of the weak interactions , will be probed directly by high energy experiments in the coming decade . in the standard model ( sm )",
    "the symmetry breaking is triggered by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of a scalar higgs field .",
    "the quantum correction to the mass of the higgs particle is , however , very sensitive to the ultraviolet ( uv ) physics . to produce the observed electroweak breaking scale , the radiative corrections to the higgs mass - squared need to be fine - tuned , unless new particles are introduced at around the 1 tev scale to cut off the quadratically divergent contributions . generally speaking ,",
    "if the scale of the electroweak symmetry breaking is to be stabilized naturally , we expect new physics to show up at the scale @xmath4 1 tev or below .    at energies below the scale of new physics",
    ", new particles can be integrated out to obtain a set of higher dimensional operators involving the standard model fields only  @xcite .",
    "these higher dimensional operators can contribute to experimental observables even at energies beneath the scales of new physics , and the size of these operators are constrained by precision measurements  @xcite .",
    "the strongest bounds are on the operators violating the ( approximate ) symmetries of the standard model , such as baryon number , flavor and cp symmetries .",
    "the dimensionful parameters suppressing these higher dimensional operators typically need to be above 100 tev due to the absence or rareness of events which violate these symmetries .",
    "this implies that the new physics at the tev scale should also respect these symmetries ( at least approximately ) . on the other hand ,",
    "operators preserving the symmetries of the standard model are expected to be induced by new physics at the tev scale .",
    "these operators can be probed by the electroweak precision measurements .",
    "the advances of the electroweak precision measurements in the past decade put significant constraints on many of these operators .",
    "the most constrained operators need to be suppressed by the energy scales @xmath5 tev  @xcite , assuming that all dimensionless coefficients are @xmath6 .",
    "taken at face value , it seems to indicate that there is no new physics up to @xmath0 tev , which creates a tension , known as the little hierarchy problem , with the naturalness requirement that new physics should appear at @xmath7 tev or below in order for the electroweak symmetry breaking to be stabilized .",
    "this discrepancy might be accidental and the electroweak scale is fine - tuned .",
    "however , it is also quite possible that the little hierarchy problem is in fact giving us an important hint of the new physics at the tev scale and ought to be taken more seriously .    in the supersymmetric extension of the standard model",
    ", a conserved @xmath8-parity can be imposed to eliminate all the tree - level contributions to the electroweak observables from the superpartners so that the coefficients of the higher dimensional operators are naturally suppressed by a loop factor .",
    "this would relieve the little hierarchy problem .",
    "however , there is still a related fine - tuning problem in supersymmetric theories . in the standard model",
    "the higgs particle has a special status as the only scalar in the theory . in supersymmetric theories",
    "there are , nevertheless , many superpartners which are also scalars .",
    "generically superpartner masses are expected to be in the same order as the higgs mass since the higgs is not special .",
    "however , the loop contributions to the electroweak observables from some superpartners as light as @xmath9(100 gev ) could still be dangerous ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath10 from top squark loops ) .",
    "moreover , in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , raising the lightest higgs mass above the experimental bound requires large top squark masses . on the other hand ,",
    "the radiative corrections to the higgs mass from the top squark masses are at least as large as the top squark masses themselves if one requires the theory to be valid up to the energy scale of the gauge coupling unification . as a result , such heavy top squarks , though more phenomenologically desirable from above discussion , introduce fine - tuning at the level of a few percent or less .",
    "this naturalness problem in supersymmetry has been discussed in many places before  @xcite .",
    "the fact that so far we have found neither the higgs , the superpartners , nor deviations from the electroweak precision data , indicates that the electroweak scale still appears to be somewhat fine - tuned for the simplest supersymmetric extensions of the standard model , even if supersymmetry is the answer to the physics beyond the standard model .",
    "little higgs theories  @xcite provide an alternative approach to stabilize the electroweak scale based on a non - linear chiral lagrangian of a coset space @xmath11 .",
    "the higgs is light because it is a pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson ( pngb ) with the unique property that its mass is protected at one - loop order from the quadratic divergences .",
    "the cutoff can therefore be raised above @xmath0  tev , beyond the scales probed by the current electroweak precision measurements .",
    "consequently the contributions from the uv physics above the cutoff are in general safe from the electroweak constraints , as long as the unbroken group @xmath12 contains a custodial @xmath13 symmetry .",
    "the one - loop quadratically divergent contributions to the higgs mass from the sm top quark , gauge fields and higgs itself are cancelled by contributions from new particles at the @xmath7 tev scale with the same spins as the sm particles .",
    "in contrast to supersymmetry , there is a natural separation in the mass scale of the higgs and the new tev particles , since the higgs is the only pngb whose mass is suppressed by a two - loop factor .",
    "the electroweak observables also receive contributions from the new tev particles in little higgs theories , and there have been several studies on this issue for various little higgs models  @xcite .",
    "the results are quite model and parameter dependent , although the general impression is that the electroweak precision data impose strong constraints on the symmetry breaking scale of @xmath14 in most of the parameter space , and hence the tev particles which cancel the quadratic divergences are required to be heavy .",
    "this in turn re - introduces fine - tuning into the little higgs models .",
    "a closer look shows that the strongest constraints come from the direct couplings of the sm fields to the new gauge bosons , as well as the vev of any @xmath13 scalar triplet which arises from coupling to the sm higgs .",
    "these couplings , however , are not an essential part of the little higgs theories ; they do not participate in the cancellation of the quadratic divergences of the higgs mass corrections . if there is a natural way , _",
    "e.g. _ , by imposing a new symmetry , to suppress these dangerous couplings in a little higgs model , it would be completely consistent with the precision electroweak constraints without any fine tuning . indeed this was achieved in ref .",
    "@xcite for a three - site moose model , where a @xmath1-parity forbids all these dangerous couplings .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss how the dangerous couplings in little higgs theories can be removed in a more general context .",
    "the @xmath1-parity is usually easy to be incorporated into the scalar and the gauge sectors .",
    "however , it was not respected by the fermion sectors in the conventional little higgs models .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the original models and the follow - up phenomenological studies , the sm fermions are assigned to particular representations under the broken group @xmath14 . from a low energy effective theory point of view",
    ", however , only the symmetry transformation property of a particle under @xmath12 is unambiguous since only the unbroken group @xmath12 is manifest . as callan , coleman , wess and zumino",
    "@xcite ( ccwz ) showed long time ago , by starting with a lagrangian manifestly invariant under the unbroken group @xmath12 and matter content furnishing linear representations of @xmath12 , one can construct a lagrangian non - linearly realizing the full symmetry @xmath14 with the help of nambu - goldstone fields which parametrize the coset space @xmath11 . from the low energy effective theory perspective , this is a more appropriate way to construct the effective lagrangian and it is not necessary to introduce linear representations of the full group @xmath14 at all .",
    "the advantage of this approach in our context is that there is a natural separation of the model - dependent dangerous interactions from those essential interactions which engineer the little higgs mechanism . in a majority of the little higgs models ,",
    "one can easily identify a little symmetry ",
    "the @xmath1-parity , which can be imposed to remove all the unwanted dangerous couplings , rendering these models completely natural .    in the next section ,",
    "we start with the minimal moose model of ref .",
    "it is an ideal example for the illustrative purpose because of its similarity to the very familiar qcd chiral lagrangian . in section  [ sec : coset ]",
    "we move on to the most popular @xmath2 littlest higgs model  @xcite and show how the @xmath1-parity can be implemented to remove the strong constraints from the electroweak precision data .",
    "the existence of the @xmath1-parity has a drastic impact on the little higgs phenomenology , which will be briefly discussed in section  [ sec : pheno ] .",
    "we will comment on general models in which @xmath1-parity can or can not be naturally implemented and draw the conclusions in section  [ sec : con ] .",
    "we start our discussion with the minimal moose model  @xcite , a two - site model based on @xmath15 global symmetry .",
    "this model does not have a custodial @xmath13 symmetry , and a large contribution to the @xmath10 parameter is already present in the non - linear sigma model , which is independent of the contributions from the tev scale particles .",
    "however , this can be easily cured by replacing the @xmath15 group with another group , such as @xmath16 , containing a custodial @xmath13 . despite of the strong electroweak constraints on this model",
    ", we will nevertheless use it to illustrate our main point because the model shares the same global symmetry breaking pattern , @xmath17 , with the very familiar qcd chiral lagrangian .",
    "the purpose here is to show how a @xmath1-parity can be naturally imposed to get rid of the dangerous tree - level couplings between sm fermions and the heavy gauge bosons .",
    "the qcd chiral lagrangian has a well - known @xmath18 symmetry : the parity which exchanges the chirality @xmath19 .",
    "baryons , transforming as octets under the unbroken @xmath20 , can be incorporated in the chiral lagrangian in many different ways .",
    "the freedom lies in the assignments of the full @xmath21 representations under which baryons transform , since there are many representations containing an octet of the unbroken @xmath20 after chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "not every assignment respects the parity symmetry in a manifest way .",
    "alternatively , we could also not worry about how baryons transform under the full chiral group and contend ourselves with the fact that baryons form an octet under the unbroken group  la ccwz . in any case , parity is a good symmetry of qcd and can be imposed in the chiral lagrangian  @xcite ; the parity transformation is non - linear and involves the goldstone bosons if baryons are assigned to a parity non - invariant representation of @xmath21 .",
    "we run into a completely similar situation in the minimal moose model .",
    "there is an incarnation of the parity in qcd : the @xmath18 reflection which interchanges the two sites .",
    "however , a nave assignment of the sm fermion under the full symmetry group does not respect the reflection symmetry , resulting in direct couplings between the standard model fermions and the heavy gauge bosons .",
    "nevertheless , as in the qcd chiral lagrangian , a linear @xmath18 parity can be consistently implemented to forbid these unwanted couplings .",
    "the parallel problem in the qcd is how to write down a chiral lagrangian including fermions which linearly realizes the parity .",
    "this problem has been explicitly worked out in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is an adaption of ccwz to the chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "we will see that , by following this approach , a @xmath1-parity which removes the electroweak constraints from the new tev particles in the minimal moose model will become manifest .",
    "the minimal moose model is a two - site @xmath15 model with four links @xmath22 .",
    "we gauge the same @xmath23 subgroup within both @xmath15 groups with equal strength .",
    "on one site and @xmath24 on the other .",
    "the reason is we want the gauge sector to respect the @xmath18 reflection symmetry .",
    "this minor difference does not affect the little higgs mechanism . ]",
    "the goldstone boson matrices , @xmath25 , each contains a triplet , a doublet and a singlet under the unbroken diagonal @xmath26 gauge group , which we take to be the electroweak @xmath27 .",

    ", we note that the matrix @xmath38 commutes with all the gauge generators and can be included in the parity transformation to flip the parity of the higgs doublet without affecting anything else .",
    "( this is in fact equivalent to a hypercharge rotation . )",
    "we therefore define the @xmath1-parity for the gauge and the scalar sectors as , @xmath39 under the @xmath1-parity , all sm gauge bosons and higgs doublets are even , and the heavy gauge bosons and scalar triplets and singlets are odd .",
    "one can immediately see that with the @xmath1-parity , there is no mixing between the sm gauge bosons and the heavy gauge bosons , and the coupling of the scalar triplets to two higgs doublets is forbidden .",
    "so there is no tadpole term to induce the triplet vevs after electroweak symmetry breaking .    in the fermionic sector @xmath40 , the right - handed ( electroweak singlet ) fermions can be easily incorporated to respect the @xmath1-parity : we assign them to be charged only under the diagonal @xmath41 , ( _ i.e. , _ they carry equal charges under @xmath42 and @xmath43 , ) @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the sm hypercharge gauge field which is a linear combination of the @xmath42 gauge field @xmath47 and @xmath43 gauge field @xmath48 . to realize the @xmath1-parity linearly for the left - handed ( electroweak doublet ) fermions , we define the matrix @xmath49 , so that @xmath50 is the square root of the link field , @xmath51  @xcite . under the global @xmath21 transformations ,",

    "this shifts the masses of @xmath122 and @xmath123 and also modifies the couplings of @xmath122 and @xmath123 to the sm fermions . secondly ,",
    "integrating out heavy gauge bosons gives additional contributions to 4-fermion interactions at low energies if the heavy gauge bosons couple to sm fermions directly .",
    "in particular , the contribution to the fermi constant @xmath224 from muon decays feeds into all precision measurements since @xmath224 is used as an input parameter .",
    "finally , for models containing scalar triplets , a vev of the triplet @xmath225 will be induced by the higgs vev if there is a coupling @xmath226 .",
    "the triplet vev also shifts the @xmath122 boson mass .",
    "these corrections are all of the order @xmath227 .",
    "because many electroweak observables such as @xmath122 mass and @xmath123 couplings to fermions are very accurately measured , the scale of @xmath3 is in general constrained to be somewhat larger than 1 tev as most phenomenological studies on little higgs theories found .",
    "this in turn re - introduces fine - tuning in the higgs mass .",
    "for example , in the original littlest higgs model , the @xmath2 model without @xmath1-parity , the scale @xmath3 needs to be above 4 tev or so @xcite in order to be compatible with precision data .    on the other hand , with @xmath1-parity all the above tree - level corrections to the electroweak observables are absent because they violate the @xmath1-parity .",
    "apart from the unknown contributions from the cutoff physics , the corrections to the electroweak observables within the effective theory are loop - suppressed .",
    "one example of such constraints is the correction to @xmath10 parameter due to the loop of the heavy top quark partner , which is responsible for cancelling the quadratic divergence from the top yukawa coupling .",
    "this correction is in the order of @xmath228 and very small .",
    "the correction to the @xmath229 vertex also gives comparable effect .",
    "in addition , the heavy gauge bosons could also contribute to the @xmath230 parameter at one loop level .",
    "all these constraints are down by a loop factor and allow the scale @xmath3 to be well below 1 tev .",
    "@xmath1-parity also drastically affects the collider phenomenology of the little higgs theories .",
    "the @xmath1-odd particles can not be singly produced due to @xmath1-parity , which implies that direct searches must rely on pair - productions .",
    "when the @xmath1-odd particles are produced , they will eventually decay into the ltp , the lightest @xmath1-odd particle , which is stable since @xmath1-parity forbids it from decaying into lighter particles which are all @xmath1-even .",
    "a charged ltp is not preferred as it can cause cosmological problems . in @xmath1-invariant models",
    "the ltp is most likely to be the @xmath231 gauge boson because its mass is suppressed by the smallness of the @xmath121 coupling and also often by the normalization factor of the @xmath209 generator , although some other neutral scalar is also possible . for a neutral ltp",
    ", the typical collider signals will be the @xmath1-odd particles decaying into jets and/or leptons plus missing energies . in this respect",
    "the phenomenology is similar to those of the supersymmetric theories with @xmath8-parity and kk - parity conserving universal extra - dimensions ( ued )  @xcite , where the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) and the lightest kk - odd particle ( lkp ) are also stable and would escape detection in collider experiments if they are neutral .",
    "moreover , the ltp could serve as a viable dark matter candidate , similar to lsp and lkp",
    ". one distinct feature of the @xmath1-invariant little higgs theories is that the top sector still contains a @xmath1-even heavy top quark partner , whose phenomenology is not affected by the @xmath1-parity .",
    "it can be used to test the little higgs mechanism in colliders , as shown in ref .",
    "the @xmath1-even top partner can be singly produced and its decay products do not necessarily give missing energies . a recent study show that it can be observed up to mass of order 2.5 tev via its decay to @xmath232 at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , for the @xmath1-odd particles such as heavy gauge bosons and scalar triplets , all the previous phenomenological studies without assuming the @xmath1-parity do not apply .",
    "the details of their phenomenology depend on the particle content and the spectrum of each individual model .",
    "in the rest of this section , we will describe in a little more detail the phenomenology of the @xmath1-invariant @xmath2 model as an example .",
    "compared with the original littlest higgs model , the @xmath1-invariant model has an extended scalar sector or fermion sector ( or both ) in the tev scale .",
    "here we consider the model with an extended fermion sector .",
    "then , in the scalar and gauge sectors , the @xmath1-invariant @xmath2 model has the same matter / field content as the littlest higgs model .",
    "there is one higgs doublet @xmath12 which is light , one heavy triplet scalar @xmath233 , and a set of massive @xmath23 gauge bosons @xmath234 and @xmath231 .",
    "the triplet scalar , responsible for cancelling the quadratic divergence of the higgs quartic coupling , can not get a vev here because it is @xmath1-odd and forbidden to have a tadpole term from coupling to the higgs doublet after electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the gauge couplings of the two @xmath23 groups are required to be equal by @xmath1-parity , implying @xmath235 and @xmath236 , where @xmath237 and @xmath238 are the gauge coupling constants for the electroweak @xmath239 .",
    "the mixing angles in the gauge couplings are set by the @xmath1-parity to be @xmath240 , instead of being free parameters as in the littlest higgs model .",
    "the masses for various gauge bosons are given by @xmath241 in the limit @xmath242 , these formulae reduce to the familiar ones : @xmath243    in the fermion sector , in addition to the top partners which cancels the quadratic divergence from the top yukawa coupling , for every sm doublet fermion there is also a vector - like @xmath1-odd @xmath27 singlet fermion and a vector - like @xmath1-even doublet fermion . if the masses of these fermions are not degenerate among different generations or aligned with the sm fermion masses , they can induce flavor - changing effects , such as @xmath244 mixing , @xmath245 and so on .",

    "their contributions to the flavor - changing neutral currents are therefore suppressed either by powers of @xmath249 , or by higher loops if the physical higgs boson or the scalar triplet is involved . for @xmath250 1 tev ,",
    "the induced flavor - changing effects are already safe even without degeneracies or alignments .",
    "as we discussed earlier in this section , within the effective theory the corrections to the electroweak observables are loop - suppressed .",
    "the strongest constraint comes from the @xmath10 correction due to heavy gauge boson loops .",
    "one can see from eq.([exact_mass ] ) that even if @xmath238 is turned off , the heavy @xmath251 and @xmath252 gauge bosons are not degenerate and the mass splitting is @xmath253 this mass splitting induces at one - loop level a custodial @xmath254 breaking effect and the correction to @xmath10 is given by @xmath255 where @xmath256 , and @xmath257 is the weinberg angle .",

    "indeed , after turning on the higgs vev , this interaction gives a mass - splitting within the standard model @xmath13 gauge bosons @xmath260 this is due to the fact that gauging two @xmath13 s in this model is a custodial @xmath254 violating effect .",
    "there are further @xmath254 breaking effects from the @xmath209 gauge couplings , but they are expected to be smaller due to the smallness of @xmath238 .",

    "( [ toprho ] ) and gives comparable constraint to @xmath275 .",
    "the contributions to the @xmath276 parameter of peskin - takeuchi  @xcite are also small .",

    "( the direct search limit is @xmath277 gev from lep ii which corresponds to @xmath278 gev . )",
    "of course , a very low @xmath3 undermines the purpose of the little higgs theories and one expects that the higher dimensional operators at the cutoff @xmath279 will give too big contributions to the electroweak observables .",

    "<S> little higgs theories are an attempt to address the `` little hierarchy problem , '' _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , the tension between the naturalness of the electroweak scale and the precision electroweak measurements showing no evidence for new physics up to 5  10 tev . in little higgs theories , </S>",
    "<S> the higgs mass - squareds are protected at one - loop order from the quadratic divergences . </S>",
    "<S> this allows the cutoff of the theory to be raised up to @xmath0 tev , beyond the scales probed by the current precision data . however , strong constraints can still arise from the contributions of the new tev scale particles which cancel the one - loop quadratic divergences from the standard model fields , and hence re - introduces the fine - tuning problem . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we show that a new symmetry , denoted as @xmath1-parity , under which all heavy gauge bosons and scalar triplets are odd , can remove all the tree - level contributions to the electroweak observables and therefore makes the little higgs theories completely natural . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1-parity can be manifestly implemented in a majority of little higgs models by following the most general construction of the low energy effective theory  la callan , coleman , wess and zumino . in particular , we discuss in detail how to implement the @xmath1-parity in the littlest higgs model based on @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry breaking scale @xmath3 can be even lower than 500 gev if the contributions from the higher dimensional operators due to the unknown uv physics at the cutoff are somewhat small . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of @xmath1-parity has drastic impacts on the phenomenology of the little higgs theories . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1-odd particles need to be pair - produced and will cascade down to the lightest @xmath1-odd particle ( ltp ) which is stable . </S>",
    "<S> a neutral ltp gives rise to missing energy signals at the colliders which can mimic supersymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> it can also serve as a good dark matter candidate . </S>"
