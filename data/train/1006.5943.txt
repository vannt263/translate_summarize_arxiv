    "much theoretical and experimental effort has been directed towards studying the viability of quantum information processing ( qip ) in recent years due to a series of remarkable qip algorithms @xcite .",
    "initial concerns about quantum coherence being too fragile to be useful have been partially dispelled with the discovery of quantum error - correcting codes @xcite , quantum threshold theorems@xcite , decoherence - free subspaces @xcite and dynamical decoupling by using optimized pulsed sequences @xcite .",
    "qubit decoherence can be attributed to various sources and has been investigated using models such as spin - bath models @xcite , hyperfine interaction models khaetskii2002,desousa2003,yao.prb.2006 and phonon induced decoherence @xcite .",
    "another common source of decoherence in solid state devices are two level systems ( tls ) that generate random telegraph noise ( rtn ) , which with a wide distribution of switching rates can give rise to @xmath0 noise @xcite . in a number of recent semiconductor quantum dot(qd ) experiments , rtn is observed when the potential in the dot lines up with the electrochemical potential in the reservoir , causing electrons to randomly tunnel back and forth between the dot and the reservoir @xcite .",
    "this puts limitations on the performance of a qd qubit , as such a random telegraphic current can modulate the qd s orbital wavefunction which can create magnetic noise via spin - orbit coupling mechanisms .",
    "this type of noise is also known to be important in superconducting qubits @xcite , and could affect the performance of other types of qubits as well @xcite .",
    "this suggests that ways be invented to prolong quantum coherence and entanglement in qubit pairs in the presence of such noise sources . in this paper",
    "we present an extremely encouraging set of results  that the exchange interaction between the qubits can be used to suppress decoherence as well as disentanglement due to rtn .",
    "this is a natural choice as the heisenberg exchange interaction between the qubits is often used in any case to implement various gate operations such as controlled - not and swap gates @xcite . thus new circuit elements are not required .",
    "typical proposals to suppress decoherence from tls that rely on spin echo techniques @xcite require additional resources and system monitoring .",
    "our proposal can be used either as an alternative or even in addition to pulsing .",
    "our aim in this paper is to show that for the maximally entangled bell states , the interaction between the qubits can be used to suppress decoherence and disentanglement . without any loss of generality ,",
    "we first analytically and numerically show this effect using a model where a single rtn source is coupled to only one of the two qubits .",
    "we then consider a model with two uncorrelated rtn sources , with each of them coupled to a qubit and show that the interaction suppresses quantum dissipation in this case as well .",
    "our analytical results suggests that a straightforward generalization can be made to the case of multiple uncorrelated rtn sources .",
    "we subsequently show that the qubit interaction suppresses decoherence even if the qubits are coupled to a large number of uncorrelated fluctuators with a @xmath0 noise power spectrum .",
    "these results are extremely important for qip as much of its vaunted capabilities are due to the fact that unlike the classical bit , multiple qubits exhibit quantum entanglement which allows multiple states to be addressed simultaneously@xcite .",
    "alternatively , an effective single qubit can be created from the exchange coupled singlet - triplet states , which will be less susceptible to rtn .    the exchange interaction in our work is taken to be an externally controllable parameter .",
    "testolin @xmath3 @xcite have proposed a model to show how the two level fluctuators itself affect the exchange interaction as a function of time , while das @xcite has shown that the interactions can lead to periodic disentanglement and entanglement between the qubits in contact with different environments .    in general , non - hermitian hamiltonians",
    "are often used to describe decay processes in open quantum systems @xcite .",
    "our calculations are done using a recently developed quasi - hamiltonian formalism which is suitable for describing the non - unitary temporal evolution of a quantum system acted on by a classical stochastic process @xcite .",
    "similar approaches have been used in refs.@xcite . in many instances",
    ", quantum and classical noise models can yield the same solution for decoherence if the noise power spectrums have the same line - shape .",
    "for example , in @xcite the analytical expression obtained for a qubit s decoherence in the presence of a thermal bosonic reservior in a lossy cavity with lorentzian broadening is exactly the same as what we obtain for classical pure dephasing noise .",
    "more recently , saira _ _ et al__@xcite have shown that within the born approximation , many fully quantum mechanical noise models can be exactly mapped onto classical stochastic noise models , including those for rtn .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we describe our single fluctuator model and the quasi - hamiltonian method in sec.[sec.model ] .",
    "then in sec.[sec.results ] , we give results and the exact bloch vector solutions for some important cases . since for qip applications the entanglement dynamics at immediate times is often the most important , in sec.[sec.small ] we obtain analytical results for the short time behavior for the bell states for any arbitrary set of noise parameters .",
    "our results are then extended to the case of two uncorrelated fluctuators in sec.[sec.hq_2f ] .",
    "this treatment of two fluctuators is then subsequently extended to treat an arbitrary number of uncorrelated fluctuators in sec.[sec.1byf ] , where we calculate the temporal dynamics of two interacting qubits in the presence of eight rtss with a @xmath0 distribution .",
    "finally we present our conclusions and implications for qubit design in sec.[sec.summary ] .",
    "it is well known that in various materials and systems sudden step like transitions occur at random intervals of time between two or more discrete voltage levels@xcite . in the case of semiconductors , these random telegraphic signals ( rts )",
    "are often attributed to trapping and release of charge carriers by defect sites . if the fuctuators are statistically independent , then the rts can be expressed as a sum of the contributions from individual fluctuations @xmath4 where , @xmath5 is a rtn sequence that switches between @xmath6 at random intervals of time , @xmath7 is the noise vector for the @xmath8 fluctuator and @xmath9 is the noise strength .",
    "their autocorrelation function is @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the switching rate of the @xmath8 fluctuator .",
    "each individual fluctuator has a lorentzian power spectrum and a broad distribution of @xmath12 results in a @xmath0 noise power spectrum@xcite .",
    "analytical solutions are however more tractable for few rtn sources , hence in this paper we first primarily focus on the dissipative effects of a single fluctuator .",
    "we then discuss the two fluctuator case , the results of which are then extended to treat a larger number of uncorrelated fluctuators with a @xmath0 noise power spectrum .",
    "we use the following hamiltonian to describe the two qubit quantum system , @xmath13+s(t)\\mathbf{g}\\cdot \\mathbf{% s_{1}}+j\\mathbf{s_{1}\\cdot s_{2 } }   \\label{h}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively represents qubits one and two , @xmath16 is the triad of pauli matrices , @xmath17 is the steady magnetic field chosen to be in the @xmath18 direction for all our calculations , and @xmath19 is the heisenberg interaction strength . note that in this model the rtn is only coupled to one qubit .",
    "earlier calculations on non - interacting qubits suggest that this is sufficient to describe all the qualitative effects @xcite . the angle @xmath20 , between the noise vector @xmath21 and magnetic field @xmath17 is called the working point of the qubit .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath22 is written for a given realization @xmath23 of the noise .",
    "physical quantities are calculated by averaging over all sequences .    since we are primarily interested in disentanglement of the qubits , it is convenient to rewrite the two qubit hamiltonian using the maximally entangled bell states @xmath24 and @xmath25 as our basis states .",

    "as the exchange interaction is turned on , the @xmath125 component of @xmath82 causes the bloch vector to precess about @xmath92 ( see fig.[blochsphere]-a ) .",
    "this effect competes with the effect of the noise , which is to drive the system toward the origin of the effective bloch sphere .",

    "as clearly seen from eqs.[nz_2f ] and [ nz_2fj ] , the bloch vectors temporal dynamics in the presence of two uncorrelated fluctuators is simply a product of the single fluctuators states shown in eqs.[nz_1f ] and [ nz_1fj ] .",
    "this suggests that the temporal dynamics of interacting qubits in the presence of multiple uncorrelated fluctuators ( which can result in @xmath0 noise ) can be just as well understood in the single fluctuator picture .",

    "as seen in the figure , the decoherence and the disentanglement is significantly delayed with increasing @xmath19 in the non - markovian and intermediate noise regimes .",

    "[ bvc1byf_psi_45]-(e ) , where one has a mixture of markovian and intermediate noise sources , small oscillations superposed on top of a smoothly decaying function can be seen .",
    "this is similar to the dissipative behavior seen for a single qubit in the presence of broad spectrum noise @xcite .",
    "as in the previous case of one and two fluctuators , once the exchange interaction is turned on , the decoherence and disentanglement dynamics is suppressed for multiple fluctuators as well .",
    "this suppression is proportional to the strength of @xmath19 . however , for the @xmath0 noise power spectrum , it is seen that the effect of @xmath19 in suppressing the decoherence is apparent only when it is at least the same order of magnitude as @xmath270 .",
    "finally , if all the uncorrelated fluctuators are at the pure dephasing point , then the decoherence and disentanglement dynamics of the coupled qubits are simply products of the dissipative dynamics due to each individual fluctuator . the short time behavior can be calculated for any number of fluctuators with any arbitrary distribution of @xmath12s and @xmath106s by taking the @xmath274 sum in eq [ nz_2fj ] from @xmath275 .",

    "our calculations are carried out using the quasi - hamiltonian method , which is seen to be a particularly powerful method while dealing the many degrees of freedom associated with @xmath0 noise .",
    "for the single fluctuator case , the suppression of decoherence is most apparent when @xmath276 and hence is more effective for non - markovian noise . for @xmath0 noise ,",
