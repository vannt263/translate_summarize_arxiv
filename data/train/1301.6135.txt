    "in fact it is proved that such operators @xmath296 are measurable operators in @xmath352 and @xmath353 this result is known as connes trace theorem . in the following theorem , we establish the analogue of this result for the noncommutative @xmath0-torus @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath336 be a classical pseudodifferential symbol of order @xmath6 on @xmath1 .",
    "then @xmath199 is a measurable operator in @xmath354 and under the assumption that all nonzero entries of @xmath355 are irrational , we have @xmath356    in order to show that @xmath357 , we write @xmath358 , where @xmath359 is the flat laplacian , and @xmath360 is a pseudodifferential operator of order 0 . since @xmath361 is a bounded operator on @xmath111 and",
    "it was shown in corollary [ indomdix ] that @xmath362 , it follows that @xmath199 is in the domain of the dixmier trace . using a similar argument",
    ", one can see that any pseudodifferential operator of order @xmath363 on @xmath1 is in the kernel of the dixmier trace .",
    "therefore , if we write @xmath364 where @xmath365 and @xmath366 are respectively positively homogeneous of order @xmath6 and @xmath367 , then @xmath368    also , since the symbol of @xmath369 is equivalent to the symbol of @xmath370 modulo a symbol of order @xmath363 , and @xmath371 is a trace , for @xmath372 we have @xmath373 it follows from this observation that if @xmath374 is smooth and positively homogeneous of order -4 , then @xmath375 if @xmath376 .",
    "therefore , similar to the argument given in @xcite one can write the following expansion with rapidly decreasing coefficients @xmath377 and conclude that @xmath378 where , as noted above , @xmath379 note that one has to use the fact that @xmath371 is continuous with respect to the uniform norm of symbols of order @xmath6 , namely that , if we let @xmath380 then @xmath381    since @xmath382 is a smooth complex - valued function on @xmath383 which is positively homogeneous of order @xmath6 , in order to analyze @xmath384 , we define a linear functional @xmath385 on the space of continuous complex - valued functions on @xmath386 , as follows .",
    "given a smooth function @xmath387 , we denote its positively homogeneous extension of order @xmath6 to @xmath383 by @xmath388 , and define @xmath389 . using the continuity property mentioned above",
    ", @xmath385 extends to the space of continuous functions on @xmath386 . also using positivity of @xmath371",
    ", one can see that @xmath385 is a positive linear functional .",
    "thus , it follows from the reisz representation theorem that @xmath385 is given by integration against a borel measure on @xmath386 .",
    "this measure is rotation invariant , which can be shown by using the trace property of @xmath371 and the fact that for any rotation @xmath287 of @xmath306 and any pseudodifferential symbol @xmath315 on @xmath306 we have @xmath390 where @xmath391 is the unitary operator @xmath392 , @xmath393 .",
    "therefore @xmath385 is given by integration against a constant multiple of the standard invariant measure on @xmath386 . denoting this constant by @xmath174 , identities ,",
    "imply that @xmath394    the constant @xmath174 can be fixed by considering the flat laplacian @xmath395 . according to corollary [ indomdix ]",
    ", we have @xmath396 .",
    "on the other hand , considering the fact that the term of order @xmath6 in the asymptotic expansion of the symbol of @xmath397 is @xmath398 , we have @xmath399",
    ". therefore @xmath400 .",
    "let @xmath233 be a smooth compact manifold of dimension @xmath401 and @xmath234 be the laplacian acting on smooth functions on @xmath235 .",
    "for any @xmath402 , the operator @xmath403 is an infinitely smoothing operator , and there is an asymptotic expansion for its kernel @xmath404 , which is of the form @xmath405 the coefficients @xmath406 are smooth functions defined in a neighborhood of the diagonal in @xmath407 .",
    "the kernel @xmath408 is called the heat kernel since it is the fundamental solution of the heat operator @xmath409 , and the @xmath406 are called the heat kernel coefficients .",
    "these coefficients are well - studied and are often known under the names of people who made the major contributions in the study , namely that , they are called both minakshisundaram - pleijel coefficients and seeley - de witt coefficients . minakshisundaram and",
    "pleijel derived the above asymptotic expansion by using the transport equation method of hadamard .",
    "an approach , which is followed in the noncommutative case in @xcite , is to use pseudodifferential calculus to derive such asymptotic expansions . for a clear account of this approach and a detailed discussion of the local geometric information that are encoded in heat coefficients ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and the references therein .",
    "a crucial point that is used to define and compute the scalar curvature for noncommutative spaces @xcite is that , up to a universal factor , the restriction of @xmath410 to the diagonal gives the scalar curvature of @xmath235 .",
    "this , via the mellin transform , allows to have a spectral definition for scalar curvature in terms of values or residues of spectral zeta functions .",
    "that is , if for instance the dimension of @xmath235 is @xmath0 , the scalar curvature is the unique @xmath411 ( up to a universal constant ) such that @xmath412 for any @xmath413 .    in this section",
    "we define the scalar curvature for @xmath1 equipped with the perturbed laplacian @xmath153 , and compute the functions that give a local expression for the curvature .",
    "then we consider the analogue of the einstein - hilbert action @xmath414 .",
    "we find a local expression for this action as well , and show that its extremum is attained if and only if the weyl factor is a constant , which is equivalent to having a metric with constant curvature .",
    "appealing to the cauchy integral formula and using similar arguments to those explained in subsection [ smtae ] ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , one can derive an asymptotic expansion of the form @xmath424 using this asymptotic expansion one can see that the zeta function @xmath425 has a meromorphic extension to the whole plane with a simple pole at @xmath426 , and @xmath427 on the other hand , there are explicit formulas for the coefficients of the above asymptotic expansion .",
    "in particular we have @xmath428    we directly compute @xmath420 using and in order to compute @xmath429 we use a homogeneity argument for the contour integral ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and pass to the spherical coordinates @xmath430 with @xmath431 @xmath432 @xmath433 @xmath434 after working out the integrations with respect to the angles @xmath435 , we obtain the following terms up to an overall factor of @xmath436 : + @xmath437 + we use the rearrangement lemma of @xcite to integrate the above terms with respect to @xmath438 from @xmath439 to @xmath278 .",
    "we recall this lemma here :      then , we use the identities ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath448 where @xmath449 and obtain the final formula for the scalar curvature in terms of @xmath450 and @xmath451 , which is recorded in the following theorem .",
    "we analyse the functions @xmath455 which describe the scalar curvature of @xmath1 , as follows .",
    "the taylor expansion of @xmath408 at @xmath439 is of the form @xmath456 we have @xmath457 , and here is the graph of this function :                  this function is not bounded from below on the main diagonal as for @xmath460 we have @xmath461 , and @xmath462 . at @xmath439",
    "we have the taylor expansion @xmath463 and here is the graph of this function :          on the other diagonal , @xmath130 is neither bounded below nor bounded above as we have @xmath465 which implies that @xmath466 this function has the following taylor expansion at @xmath439 @xmath467 and here is its graph :          since @xmath469 and @xmath470 , in the commutative case , the scalar curvature given by reduces to @xmath471 which , up to a normalization factor , is the scalar curvature of the ordinary @xmath0-torus equipped with the metric @xmath472 .",
    "let us recall from theorem [ scthm ] that up to a factor of @xmath452 @xmath476 writing @xmath408 as a fourier transform @xmath477 we have @xmath478 also , by writing @xmath130 as a fourier transform @xmath479 we have @xmath480 therefore @xmath481 where @xmath482      we show that the einstein - hilbert action @xmath473 attains its maximum if and only if the weyl factor @xmath483 is a constant .",
    "this is done by combining the two terms in the explicit formula for @xmath473 , and observing that it can be expressed by a non - negative function .",
    "we note that the function @xmath484 in , which was analysed in subsection [ scsub ] , is neither bounded below nor bounded above .",
    "the maximum of the einstein - hilbert action is equal to @xmath439 , and it is attained if and only if the weyl factor is a constant .",
    "that is , for any weyl factor @xmath485 we have @xmath486 and the equality happens if and only if @xmath451 is a constant .",
    "the taylor expansion of @xmath287 at 0 is of the form @xmath491 we have @xmath492 .",
    "moreover , this function is non - negative as its absolute minimum is approximately @xmath493 which is attained around @xmath494 .",
    "here is the graph of this function :          since @xmath287 is a non - negative function and @xmath495 for @xmath496 , we have @xmath497 in the last inequality we have used the fact that @xmath498 is a selfadjoint operator with respect to the inner product @xmath499 also , faithfulness of @xmath35 implies that for each @xmath500 @xmath501 if and only if @xmath502 .",
    "thus , it follows from that @xmath503 and the equality happens if and only @xmath502 for all @xmath504 which holds if and only if @xmath451 is a constant .",
