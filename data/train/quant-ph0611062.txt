    "[ fig : dos ] for the special case of @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",

    "we add this contribution to each of the reduced densities of states arising from the family of periodic orbits and arrive at @xmath101 series of delta peaks with a height increasing linearly with energy .",

    "[ fig : dos](b ) , so that the ground state energy @xmath164 is associated with the irreducible representation ( 0,0 ) .",
    "although this example indicates that the semiclassical treatment reproduces the spectrum of the commensurate anisotropic harmonic oscillator , it is useful to explicitly perform the sum over the reduced densities of states ( [ eqnscdosc - ahoreduced ] ) @xmath165 by interchanging the double sum with the sum over all repetitions @xmath42 in eq .",
