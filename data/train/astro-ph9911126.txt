    "the theory of cyclotron and synchrotron radiation is a well established part of physics .",
    "however , there still remain uncertainties about the accuracy and the range of applicability of some analytic formulae describing the emission .",
    "one important example of such uncertainties concerns the spectra of synchrotron emission from mildly - relativistic and relativistic thermal plasma , in which case numerous studies devoted to this field , e.g. , jones & hardee ( 1979 ) , petrosian ( 1981 , hereafter p81 ) , takahara & tsuruta ( 1982 ) , petrosian & mctiernan ( 1983 ) , robinson & melrose ( 1984 ) , mahadevan , narayan & yi ( 1996 , hereafter mny96 ) , yielded results not entirely consistent with each other .",
    "precise determination of spectra from the thermal synchrotron process is of key significance for studies of emission from accretion flows onto black holes and neutron stars .",
    "although direct , optically - thin , thermal synchrotron emission is rarely observable , accurate optically - thin spectra are necessary to determine the turnover frequency , below which the plasma becomes optically - thick .",
    "the resulting partially - absorbed spectrum is then observable in some cases .",
    "furthermore , photons from that spectrum provide a supply of seed photons for comptonization in the plasma , which process gives rise to observable power - law spectra with high - energy cutoffs . on the other hand , blackbody radiation emitted by optically - thick accretion discs and other forms of optically - thick matter may constitute a competing supply of seed photons .",
    "in addition , bremsstrahlung radiation is always emitted by a hot plasma .    in this work ,",
    "we first consider formulae for the synchrotron emission coefficient of a thermal plasma ( section [ s : synrad ] ) .",
    "we clarify the accuracy and the range of applicability of previously derived formulae as well as propose our own expressions .",
    "we concentrate on mildly relativistic and relativistic plasmas , as exhaustive studies of non - relativistic thermal cyclotron emission exist ( chanmugam et al .",
    "1989 and references therein ) .",
    "we then calculate the turnover frequency and consider effects of bremsstrahlung emission and self - absorption .",
    "second , we investigate comptonization of the synchrotron radiation ( hereafter abbreviated as the cs process ) and present convenient formulae for the resulting spectra and luminosities ( section [ s : compt ] ) . in section [ applications ] , we apply our results to two main geometries of accretion flows onto a black hole : a hot , two - temperature , optically thin disc , and active regions above a cold disc ( i.e. , a patchy corona ) . those two models , for various plausible prescriptions for the magnetic field strength ,",
    "are then compared with spectral data from black - hole binaries and agns . finally , in section [ neutron ]",
    ", we study the importance of the cs proces for formation of spectra of accreting neutron stars with weak / moderate magnetic fields .",

    "let @xmath3 be the angle between @xmath4 and @xmath1 , and @xmath5 be the angle between @xmath1 and the direction towards the observer .",
    "then , the cyclo - synchrotron power per unit frequency and unit solid angle in the observer frame and in cgs units is given by ( e.g.  bekefi 1966 ; pacholczyk 1970 ) @xmath6,}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 @xmath8 is the cyclotron frequency , @xmath9 is the lorentz factor , @xmath10 is a bessel function of order @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the electron mass .",
    "note that an additional factor of @xmath13 due to the doppler effect should have appeared in the formal derivation of equation ( [ pojed ] ) .",
    "however , this term disappears in the case of an electron moving chaotically , as , e.g. , in a thermal plasma . for detailed discussion , see scheuer ( 1968 ) , rybicki & lightman ( 1979 , section 6.7 ) , pacholczyk ( 1970 , section 3 ) and references in these works .",
    "the emission coefficient , @xmath14 , of a thermal plasma at a temperature , @xmath15 , and with a uniform magnetic field , @xmath1 , can be obtained by integrating the rate of equation ( [ pojed ] ) over a relativistic maxwellian electron distribution , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the dimensionless plasma temperature , and @xmath18 is the electron density .",
    "@xmath19 is a modified bessel function , which can be approximated by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is euler s constant and the last coefficients in the series have been adjusted to achieve a relative error @xmath22 .",

    "the coefficients for polarized radiation are then related to the coefficients including both polarizations by @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",

    "if the argument of the airy function is @xmath48 , we approximate it by its power series [ equation ( 10.4.3 ) in as70 ] up to the 13th power .",

    "typical relative accuracy of the resulting approximation to @xmath10 is then @xmath50 .",

    "the derivative , @xmath51 , is calculated with the second expression in equation ( 9.1.30 ) of as70 .",

    "synchrotron photons produced in a plasma will , in general , be compton scattered by the plasma electrons . in the case of a thermal plasma ,",
    "the synchrotron spectrum is usually self - absorbed up to a high value of @xmath60 ( section [ ss : turn ] ) . in that case",
    ", the self - absorbed synchrotron spectrum is rather narrow , consisting of a hard rayleigh - jeans spectrum at @xmath120 ( in which regime scattering can be neglected , @xmath121 , @xmath122 ) , and a fast - declining tail of the optically - thin synchrotron spectrum at @xmath123 ( where absorption can be neglected , @xmath124 , @xmath125 ) .",

    ", we have , @xmath359^{-1/2}\\ { \\rm g}.\\ ] ] note that the radiation - pressure dominated region appears only for accretion rates higher than certain value @xmath360 .",
    "hereafter , we will assume @xmath361 and that half of the accreted energy is dissipated in the corona , i.e. , @xmath362 .",
    "we assume the efficiency of cooling - dominated accretion in the schwarzschild metric , which gives the power dissipated in the corona of @xmath363 .",
    "we first compare the maximum strength of coronal magnetic field of equation ( [ e : radfield2 ] ) with the disc field of equations ( [ e : disc_gasfield])-([e : disc_radfield ] ) . for parameters relevant to compact objects ,",
    "the disc field is always larger than the maximum coronal magnetic field , up to two orders of magnitude , except for extremely low accretion rates , @xmath364 .",
    "this shows the self - consistency of the coronal models of sections [ radiation]-[dissipation ] .    as discussed above ,",
    "given the uncertainties about the mechanism of magnetic field reconnection in active regions above accretion discs , we can not rule out the presence of an average coronal field strength , @xmath365 , stronger than that of equation ( [ e : radfield2 ] ) , and limited by equations ( [ e : disc_gasfield])-([e : disc_radfield ] ) , @xmath366 where @xmath367 accounts for an inevitable decay of the field during a flare event . the dissipation rate of the magnetic field in a reconnection event is @xmath368 ( see e.g.  section 12.4 in longair 1992 ) so the field decays exponentially .",
    "since the above average is weighted by the luminosity of an active region , which quickly decreases with decreasing @xmath114 , @xmath369 can be , in principle , of the order of unity .",
    "thus , we adopt @xmath370 in numerical examples below .    assuming the magnetic field strength given by equation ( [ bd ] ) , we obtain for disc regions dominated by the gas pressure , @xmath371 for @xmath372 and @xmath373 for @xmath335 .",
    "similar expressions can be derived for regions dominated by the radiation pressure .",
    "figure [ comparison2 ] shows the above ratios for the same values of @xmath130 , @xmath57 and @xmath241 ( except that @xmath240 was assumed for the average seyfert 1 spectrum ) as in figure [ comparison ] as functions of @xmath357 for @xmath370 , @xmath303 , and @xmath302 .",
    "we see that the obtained luminosity is comparable to the one dissipated in the corona only in the case of cyg x-1 .",
    "in other cases , the cs process gives a small contribution , comparable to or lower than the contribution of bremsstrahlung .",
    "= 7.2 cm    in the case of ngc 4258 , we can reproduce the 210 kev power - law index and luminosity with @xmath374 and @xmath303 .",
    "we note , however , that the cs luminosity is a sensitive function of the size of active regions in this model , @xmath375 ( which dependence is much stronger than that in the previous coronal models ) . based on equation ( [ e : height ] )",
    ", we expect @xmath376 decreasing with the decreasing @xmath203 .",
    "if this is indeed the case for ngc 4258 , the model of coronal cs emission could be then ruled out for this object ( unless @xmath377 , as in the case discussed in section [ dissipation ] above ) .",
    "we therefore again conclude that , in coronal models , the cs radiation can be important only in the case of stellar - mass sources with hard spectra .",
    "this radiative process is negligible in the case of objects with soft spectra ( probably including low - luminosity sources ) when comptonization of photons from a cold accretion flow is expected to dominate .",
    "note that if the disc magnetic field pressure is less than that of equipartition , e.g. , by @xmath296 ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , the predicted upper limits of @xmath189 would be even lower ( e.g.  by an order of magnitude for @xmath361 ) .",
    "we can compare our conclusions with those of ghisellini , haardt & svensson ( 1998 ) , who also consider magnetically dominated , patchy coronae and compare the relative importance of comptonization of synchrotron and disc photons .",
    "they , however , do not assume a thermal electron distribution but instead assume a given form of electron acceleration and then calculate the electron distribution taking into account a balance between the acceleration , escape , compton cooling and synchrotron emission and reabsorption .",
    "a resulting electron distribution consists typically of a quasi - thermal hump and a high - energy tail , which is an important difference with respect to the calculations presented here .",
    "furthermore , they assume a constant magnetic field for a series of models with varying luminosity , and their magnetic field is not directly compared to that produced in the disc .    still",
    ", their findings are compatible with ours .",
    "namely , among the specific models they present , the cs process dominates only when @xmath378 and the magnetic energy density is more than one order of magnitude higher than that of radiation , see their figure 4 .",
    "we find that the parameters of their models with the cs process dominating , correspond approximately to @xmath379 , i.e.  to low - luminosity sources , in our model above ( assuming @xmath380 and @xmath381 ) .",
    "then , at @xmath378 , we obtain predictions about the significance of the cs process similar to theirs .",
    "power - law x - ray spectra are , in fact , observed not only from black - hole sources .",
    "similar power laws are detected , e.g. , from binary systems with weakly - magnetized neutron stars in the so - called low spectral state .",
    "unambiguous classification of some of those sources as neutron stars comes from detections of type-1 x - ray bursts from them .",
    "those spectra are often modelled by thermal comptonization ( e.g.  barret et al .  1999 , hereafter b99 ) ,",
    "in which case the question arises of the origin of seed photons .",
    "it is also of interest that accreting weakly - magnetized neutron stars show a number of similarities to accreting black holes ( see e.g.  a discussion in b99 ) .",
    "first , this concerns timing properties in x - rays , namely time lags between soft and hard x - rays , which suggests similar geometries of the sources and/or similar variability mechanisms ( e.g.  ford et al .",
    "second , spectra of black holes in their hard states fit remarkably well a correlation between the 120 and 20200 kev luminosities seen in neutron - star binaries ( barret , mcclintock & grindlay 1996 ) which may indicate that similar radiation mechanisms are operating in the two classes of objects . on the other hand , the presence of the neutron star results in more sources of soft photons than in the case of a black hole , namely thermal radiation from the surface of the star and synchrotron radiation in the stellar magnetic field .",
    "cyclotron radiation as a source of soft photons comptonized in weakly magnetized accreting neutron stars has recently been considered by psaltis ( 1998 ) . in his model ,",
    "self - absorbed cyclotron photons are produced in a layer above the stellar surface with @xmath382 kev and a magnetic field of @xmath383 g , and then subsequently comptonized in a hot spherical corona of @xmath384 kev . here , we consider a more generic geometry in which synchrotron photons are produced and comptonized in the same medium , the temperature of which is determined from observations .",
    "this leads us to investigating plasmas of temperatures higher than those considered by psaltis ( 1998 ) . as in section 4",
    ", we compare the luminosities in our model spectra to those observed .",
    "we analyze here spectra of four x - ray bursters .",
    "the first one is 4u  0614 + 091 , which low - state spectrum was fitted with the comptonization model of poutanen & svensson ( 1996 ) by piraino et al .",
    "they found the seed blackbody photons have @xmath385 ev , and the plasma parameters are given by @xmath386 and @xmath387 .",
    "the luminosity was @xmath388 erg  s@xmath197 assuming @xmath389 kpc ( brandt et al .",
    "it is interesting that the above electron temperature is much higher than that seen from other x - ray bursters so far .",
    "the parameters of the second object in our sample , 1e  17243045 , modeled by b99 with a comptonization model of titarchuk ( 1994 ) are @xmath390 kev , @xmath391 , @xmath392 .",
    "( since b99 did not give the spectral index of their fit , we have obtained it from the comptonization model they used . ) the luminosity , given @xmath393 kpc ( barbuy , bica & ortolani 1998 ) , is @xmath394 erg  s@xmath197 .",
    "the third source is gs  1826238 , for which b99 found @xmath395 , and @xmath396 from the high - energy tail with the model of poutanen & svensson ( 1996 ) . at @xmath397 kpc ( b99 ) , @xmath398 erg  s@xmath197 .",
    "observations of the fourth object , xb  1916053 , were reported by church et al .",
    "the x - ray spectrum was fitted as a power - law of index @xmath399 and the temperature was estimated from the cut - off in the spectrum to be @xmath400 . at @xmath401 kpc , @xmath402 erg s@xmath197 ( church et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "we consider then a generic model with a spherical , uniform , plasma cloud , and investigate the relation between the size of the cloud and the magnetic field strength required to reproduce the observed luminosities at their spectral indices and temperatures . from equations ( [ nu_ratio ] ) and ( [ softl ] )",
    ", we expect that this relation will be roughly of the form of @xmath403 .",
    "we note that since a cs spectrum is normalized by its self - absorbed , optically - thick , part , the luminosity is roughly proportional to the source area , with the source geometry being only of secondary importance .",
    "thus , our results may also approximate those for emission from a thin layer above the stellar surface . a second constraint on the model can be obtained from the fitted temperature of the seed photons , which is known for 4u  0614 + 091 and 1e  17243045 . in those cases",
    ", we can identify the seed - photon temperature with the maximum possible turnover energy , @xmath404 , which then yields an upper limit on @xmath114 .",
    "this limit is @xmath405 g and @xmath406 g , respectively . in the case of gs  1826238",
    ", the seed - photon temperature was not fitted , but we can estimate , from the shape of the spectrum presented by b99 , that @xmath407 kev , which yields @xmath408 g. we have no corresponding limit for xb  1916 - 053 .",
    "= 7.2 cm    the size  magnetic field relation obtained for the four objects is shown in figure [ xrb ] .",
    "those results suggest that comptonization may take place in a corona of the size comparable to the stellar radius ( @xmath409 cm ) .",
    "the required magnetic field is then @xmath126 g. this value is consistent both with the upper limits resulting from fitting the energy of seed photons and with the maximum field strength possible in x - ray bursters , @xmath383@xmath410 g , see lewin , van paradijs & taam ( 1995 ) .",
    "( their constraint results from the requirement that the magnetic field does not funnel matter towards the magnetic poles , and more stringent constraints can be obtained for a specific structure of the accretion flow . )",
    "we note that if comptonization takes place close to the stellar surface , reflection albedo close to unity would be required . otherwise reprocessing in the surface layers",
    "would result in a strong blackbody component , which is not seen .",
    "we also find that it is unlikely that the size of the region where synchrotron photons ( dominating the supply of seed photons ) are produced and comptonized is much larger than the neutron star radius",
    ". such a configuration would be then similar to that of an optically thin disc around a black hole ( section [ hot_ions ] ) or an advection - dominated extended corona above a cold disc ( narayan , barret & mcclintock 1997 ) .",
    "then the required magnetic field , @xmath411 g at @xmath412 cm , would be too strong to be sustained by the disc [ see equation ( [ b ] ) , where we estimate the magnetic field in hot , optically thin , discs ] .",
    "a general feature of models of accretion flows around black holes considered above is the dependence of @xmath413 [ or very close to it , equation ( [ e : disc_gasfield ] ) ] .",
    "this then implies decreasing values of @xmath238 with @xmath241 , and the relative importance of the cs process much weaker in agns than in black - hole binaries .",
    "the predicted values of @xmath414 strongly increase with increasing spectral hardness and temperature of the plasma . compared with observations",
    ", we find that both the hot flow and coronal models can , in principle , explain emission of the hardest ( @xmath415 ) among luminous ( eddington ratios of @xmath276 ) , stellar - mass , sources in terms of the cs process .",
    "however , this process provides a negligible contribution to the luminosity , @xmath203 , of luminous stellar - mass sources with soft spectra and of luminous agns regardless of @xmath130 . taking into account the overall similarity between properties of luminous sources with either hard or soft spectra and containing either stellar - mass or supermassive black holes ( e.g. , zdziarski 1999 ) , it is likely that the cs process is in general energetically negligible in luminous sources .",
    "however , the hot flow and coronal models differ in their predictions for the relative importance of the cs process with decreasing @xmath211 . in the hot flow model",
    ", there is clearly a range of @xmath416 , in which the cs process can yield a dominant contribution to @xmath203 even in the case of agns . on the other hand , the coronal models have rather weak dependences of @xmath347 on @xmath211 .",
    "however , at some low value of @xmath211 , bremsstrahlung emission becomes dominant .",
    "therefore , we have found that , in the coronal models , there is no range of @xmath211 ( except for hard , stellar - mass , sources , see above ) in which the cs process could dominate energetically . in both models ,",
    "bremsstrahlung is expected to give the main contribution to @xmath203 in very weak sources .",
    "there are three complications in the picture above .",
    "first , the plasma parameters are expected , in general , to depend on @xmath211 , which will modify theoretical dependences of @xmath306 on the eddington ratio .",
    "this is especially the case of the electron temperature , which is expected to be higher in low - luminosity sources , due to less efficient plasma cooling .",
    "this would strongly increase the efficiency of the cs process .",
    "we did not consider temperatures much higher than those observed in luminous objects , thus our conclusions about the role of the cs process in low - luminosity sources are rather conservative .",
    "unfortunately , we have as yet no observational constraints on the plasma temperature in such sources .",
    "second , we have considered here accretion onto non - rotating black holes .",
    "black - hole rotation increases , in general , the efficiency of accretion , and the cs process may yield then luminosities higher than those found here .",
    "this is , in fact , confirmed by a study of kurpiewski & jaroszyski ( 1999 ) , who have considered advection - dominated flows and have found that an increase of the black - hole angular momentum leads to increase of the cs emission .",
    "this happens due to both the synchrotron emission itself as well its comptonization becoming much more effective in innermost regions of the disc .",
    "analysis of those issues is , however , beyond the scope of this work .",
    "third , even when other processes dominate energetically , there can be a range of photon energies in which the cs process gives the dominant contribution .",
    "still , the strong conclusion of section [ applications ] is that the thermal cs process does not dominate observed x - ray spectra of luminous black - hole sources .",
    "rather , the dominant x - ray producing process in those sources appears to be comptonization of blackbody photons emitted by some optically - thick medium , e.g. , an optically - thick accretion disc or clumps of cold matter .",
    "observationally , the presence of such component is indicated by the wide - spread presence of compton reflection from a cold medium in luminous black - hole sources ( e.g.  zdziarski et al .",
    "1999 ) as well as observations of blackbody - like soft x - ray components in spectra of black - hole binaries ( e.g.ebisawa et al .",
    "furthermore , a very strong correlation between the reflection strength and the x - ray spectral index is present in those sources ( zdziarski et al .",
    "1999 ) , in particular in cyg x-1 and gx 3394 ( gilfanov , churazov & revnivtsev 1999 ; revnivtsev , gilfanov & churazov 1999 ) .",
    "the presence of such correlation is naturally explained in models with plasma cooling due to blackbody emission of cold matter , whereas it can not be explained if the cs process dominates .",
    "on the other hand , we find in section [ neutron ] that the thermal cs process can easily account for power law emission of weakly magnetized neutron stars in their low states .",
    "a possible caveat for that model is that a correlation between reflection and @xmath130 has been observed in 4u  0614 + 091 ( piraino",
    "1999 ) , although its interpretation remains ambiguous due to the lack of a detection of blackbody emission strong enough to provide seed photons for comptonization .",
    "we point out that a small non - thermal tail in the electron distribution due to acceleration ( as in the model of ghisellini et al .",
    "1998 ) , e.g.  stochastic or in reconnection events could significantly increase the turnover frequency ( since electrons with @xmath417 are usually responsible for emission at the turnover frequency ) , and thus increase the cs luminosity from accreting black holes and neutron stars .",
    "this issue is the subject of our work in progress .",
    "finally , we notice thermal comptonization may be ( at most ) a secondary process in spectral formation in some classes of compact x - ray sources",
    ". one important class of such sources are black - hole binaries in the soft state , which x - ray and soft -ray spectra appear non - thermal ( e.g.  gierliski et al .",
    "1999 ) . in that case",
    ", the x - ray spectrum contains a very strong blackbody component , which probably dominates over synchrotron photons as seeds for non - thermal comptonization .",
    "the main results of this work can be outlined as follows .",
    "we have derived and tested analytic approximations for the synchrotron emission coefficient in thermal plasmas , applicable especially to the semi - relativistic range of temperatures , @xmath418 k. we have also obtained analytic approximations to the turnover frequency ( at which the plasma becomes optically - thick to absorption ) .",
    "then , we have presented a method to treat thermal comptonization of synchrotron radiation .",
    "our approximate analytic expressions allow for self - consistent calculations of the spectrum and the luminosity of such a source and can be easily applied to models of accretion discs .",
    "we have also investigated the role of the thermal cs process in accretion flows around stellar - mass and supermassive black holes .",
    "we have considered two main scenarios : a hot , two - temperature , optically - thin flow and active regions above a cold , optically - thick disc .",
    "we have found that this process is only marginally important in luminous x - ray sources containing accreting black holes , and it can possibly dominate only in stellar - mass sources with hardest spectra .",
    "the dominant radiative process in those sources appears to be comptonization of blackbody radiation emitted by cold matter in the vicinity of the hot plasma . on the other hand",
    ", the cs process can explain x - ray spectra of weaker sources , e.g. , low - luminosity agns , but only in the hot - flow model .",
    "finally , below certain low luminosity , bremsstrahlung becomes the dominant process .    finally , we considered the case of weakly - magnetized accreting neutron stars .",
    "we have found that their power - law x - ray spectra in the low state can be accounted for by the cs process taking place in a corona of the size comparable to the stellar radius .",
