    "cycle decomposition is a very useful tool to estimate first hitting times for stochastic processes . in this note we compare , and prove the equivalence , between two different approaches that will be respectively called _ path _ and _ graph cycle _ decompositions .",
    "these results are utterly important in the generic study of the metastability phenomenon .",
    "the phenomenon of metastability is defined by the following scenario : ( i ) a system is `` trapped '' for an abnormally long time in a state  the _ metastable state _  different from the eventual equilibrium state consistent with the thermodynamical parameters .",
    "( ii ) in the metastable state the system behaves as if it were in regular equilibrium .",
    "( iii ) subsequently , the system undergoes a _ sudden _ transition at a _ random time _ from the metastable to the stable state .",
    "the mathematical study of this phenomenon has been a standing issue since the foundation of statistical mechanics , but only in the 80 s rigorous mathematical approaches started to be developed and , due to the great interest of the subject , they then proliferated to a multitude of different approaches . these mathematical approaches , however , are not completely equivalent as they rely on different definitions of metastable states and thus involve different properties of hitting and escape times .",
    "the situation is particularly delicate for evolutions of infinite  volume systems and for irreversible systems .",
    "the proliferation of definitions and hypotheses on metastable behavior arises from the diversity of the physical situations in which the phenomenon appears .",
    "this diversity results in contrasting demands on the appropriate mathematical theory .",
    "the main issues confronted by the mathematical treatment of metastability can be grouped into three categories .",
    "_ conservative vs non  conservative dynamics .",
    "_ this dichotomy applies to dynamics for statistical mechanical models of fluids or magnets .",
    "non  conservative dynamics are those that do not conserve the total number of particles or the total magnetization .",
    "they include glauber ( that is , single spin  flip ) dynamics ( used to model metastable ferromagnets ) and many probabilistic cellular automata ( that is , parallel dynamics ) .",
    "in contrast , conservative dynamics are suitable to the study of supersaturated gases .",
    "its study poses _ enormous challenges _ because particle or magnetization conservation introduces non  local effects .",
    "_ finite vs infinite configuration space .",
    "_ two extreme types of metastability studies can be distinguished . in the _ finite  space _",
    "case , the configuration space remains fixed ( or bounded ) while the drift towards ( meta)stable configurations is increased ( e.g. , temperature goes to zero ) . in the _ infinite  space _ setup , the size of the configuration space grows in an unbounded fashion , while drifts are kept approximately constant . in many instances both parameters ( drift and size of the space )",
    "change simultaneously , but usually these changes are coupled so one of the effects is dominant .",
    "mathematically , the distinction stems from the possibility of `` entropic '' effects in the infinite  volume case that changes the scale at which distribution laws must be controlled .",
    "the iconic case is the thermodynamic limit of spin or gas models , see for instance @xcite . in these models ,",
    "exit from metastability requires _ nucleation _ , that is the formation of a critical droplet .",
    "the probability of such an event in a large volume must include the `` entropic contribution '' due to the fact that the nucleation can take place anywhere in the volume .    _ parallel dynamics and cost functions .",
    "_ following the matrix imposed by metropolis and glauber dynamics , stochastic transition rates are written as exponentials of _ cost functions_. for reversible single spin ",
    "flip dynamics these costs are determined by the difference of energy between the two states involved in the move .",
    "this is not so for parallel dynamics ( for instance for probabilistic cellular automata @xcite ) in which , at each step , all spins are independently tested . in such evolutions , costs are a possibly complicated function of the different patterns of spin flips connecting the relevant states . in these cases",
    "it is therefore necessary to dissociate energy profiles from _ energy barriers_. the former are associated to invariant measures and determine the set of stable and metastable configurations .",
    "the latter are associated to transition rates and determine drifts and exit times .",
    "early approaches to metastability were based on the computation of expected values with respect to restricted equilibrium states @xcite . this paradigm is still influential in physics , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the influence of probability on statistical mechanics led to an alternative pattern of thoughts based on stochastic dynamics and focused on their spectral properties and on the behavior of their typical trajectories .",
    "this point of view has given rise to different theoretical constructions that can be classified , roughly , in three major groups .    _",
    "( i ) classical approach : hitting times of markov chains . _ the escape time from metastability is determined , by the _",
    "visiting _ or _ hitting _ time to a set of states of very small ( invariant ) measure , when most of the measure is carried by a different , somehow reduced , set of states ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "similar problems were confronted in reliability theory where typical states were called _",
    "good _ and those concerned by the hitting times were called _",
    "bad_. the exponential character of good  to  bad transitions is due to the existence of two different time scales : long times are needed to go from good to bad states , while the return to good states from anywhere ( except , perhaps , the bad states ) is much shorter . as a result , a system in a good state can reach the bad ones only through a large fluctuation bringing it all the way to the bad state .",
    "indeed , any  intermediate \" fluctuation would be followed by an unavoidable return to the good states , where , by markovianity , the process would start afresh independently of previous attempts . hence , the escape time is made of a large number of independent returns to the good states followed by a final successful excursion to badness that must happen without hesitation , in a much shorter time .",
    "the exit time is , therefore , a geometric random variable with extremely small success probability .",
    "in the limit exponentiality is found .    _",
    "( ii ) large deviations of trajectory distributions . _",
    "freidlin and wentzel @xcite were the first to use the large deviation machinery to study the problem of exit times from an attractive domain .",
    "their theory applies to stochastic differential equations with a deterministic driving gradient force and a small brownian stochastic term .",
    "the deterministic part of the dynamics is responsible for the fast return to `` good states '' while the stochastic contribution provides the escape mechanism .",
    "the smallness of this last contribution leads to very long time scales for the visit to `` bad '' states .",
    "typical trajectories are described using a graphical method built out of two basic ingredients : _ cycles _ ( associated to metastable pieces of trajectories ) and _ exit tubes _ ( describing typical escape trajectories ) .",
    "the freidlin and wentzel theory evolved into two related schools that we shall call the _ graphical _ @xcite and the _ pathwise _",
    "@xcite approach .",
    "the former relies on a refinement of freidlin and wentzel s graphical methods allowing for a detailed study of exit paths via a decomposition into cycles and saddle points traversed from cycle to cycle .",
    "the exit time also decomposes into the time spent at each point of the exit path .",
    "this graphical approach has been applied to reversible metropolis dynamics and to simulated annealing in @xcite .",
    "the pathwise approach , on the other hand , proposed in @xcite , was introduced as an adaptation of the ideas of freidlin and wentzel to metropolis  like dynamics , with all notions and properties expressed in terms of an energy profile associated to the invariant measure .",
    "this provides a clearer and physically appealing picture .",
    "in particular , absolute energy minima identify stable states and  deep \" local energy minima lead to metastability .",
    "the two time scales within each energy well correspond , respectively , to fast `` downhill '' and infrequent `` uphill '' trajectories . in the limit of very steep wells ( temperature tending to zero ) , the theory yields rather precise information on : ( i ) the _ transition time _ ,",
    "i.e. , the time needed to arrive to the stable equilibrium , which is determined by the height of the largest energy barrier separating metastable from stable states .",
    "( ii ) the _ typical exit tube _ , i.e. , the sequences of configurations along which the formation of the stable phase takes place .",
    "this is the physically relevant mechanism that , in gas or spin systems , is mediated by the appearance of a _",
    "critical droplet _ after which the system quickly relaxes to equilibrium .",
    "the full power of this method was first exploited in @xcite and comprehensively reviewed in @xcite .",
    "it has been extended to non ",
    "reversible markov processes in @xcite ( though irreversibility brings back to the graphical approach ) .",
    "the approach was further simplified in @xcite where transition times are determined on the basis of a ranking of _ stability levels _ , without requiring detailed knowledge of typical trajectories .    _",
    "( iii ) potential  theoretical approach : spectral properties of markov transition matrices .",
    "_ in the early eighties aldous and brown @xcite proposed a new approach to the hitting  time theory based on spectral properties of the transition matrix and the use of the dirichlet form .",
    "this approach has the advantage of leading to quite precise error bounds for the exponential approximation .",
    "the current version of this strategy is the potential ",
    "theoretic approach developed in @xcite ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "besides exponential laws , this method gives more precise estimates of the expected value of the transition time , including a prefactor that can not be found with alternative approaches .",
    "the determination of this prefactor , however , requires the knowledge of the critical droplet and neighboring configurations ; information that has to be imported from more detailed pathwise studies . in @xcite",
    "another use of spectral and potential theoretical techniques is proposed in which only visits to well bottoms are registered . upon time",
    "rescaling , a continuous  time markov process is obtained whose transition rates encode the information on transition times .",
    "( see also @xcite for recent development ) .",
    "we outline briefly some applications of the theories described above .",
    "the aim is not to be exhaustive , but rather to list references useful in relation to the definitions and comparisons to follow .",
    "the general theory @xcite and metastability studies in the nineties ( see @xcite for the pathwise approach and @xcite for the graphical approach ) refer to single ",
    "spin flip dynamics ( metropolis , glauber ) of ising  like models ( including mean  field versions ) in finite volume and at low temperature .",
    "studies within the general potential theoretical approach refer both to a general markov ",
    "process point of view @xcite and applications to mean  field and ising model @xcite .",
    "the study of metastability for conservative dynamics started a decade after and initially involved nearest ",
    "neighbor lattice gases at low temperature and density inside finite boxes with open boundary conditions mimicking infinite reservoirs fixing particle density .",
    "relevant references are @xcite for the pathwise approach and @xcite for the potential theoretic approach .    models with parallel dynamics were studied first from a numerical point of view in @xcite and then rigorously in @xcite ( pathwise approach ) and @xcite ( potential theoretic approach ) .    the more involved infinite ",
    "volume limit , at low temperature or vanishing magnetic field , was first studied via large deviations techniques in @xcite and potential theoretically in @xcite .",
    "these references dealt with ising and blume  capel models under glauber dynamics . the ising lattice gas model subjected to kawasaki dynamics",
    "was studied in @xcite and @xcite ( potential theoretic approach ) in the limit of temperature and volume growing exponentially fast to infinity .      as it has been explained above , due to the great theoretical and applicative interest of metastability , different mathematical theories of metastability",
    "have been developed in the past years .",
    "it is interesting to understand the mutual connections in order to apply results proven in one framework to systems that are naturally approached in a different one .",
    "we have also remarked that within each theory different flavors have appeared . in particular , in the framework of the  large deviation \" point of view , two different approaches to cycle decomposition , the _ graphical _ and the _ path _",
    "one , have been developed .",
    "the former has been introduced and applied in a very general setup while the latter as been first introduced for metropolis dynamics and then extended to models with cost functions such as probabilistic cellular automata @xcite .",
    "due to its generality , the results on hitting times proven with the graphical approach are written in terms of complicated expression whose physical meaning is sometimes difficult to be caught . on the other hand , in the framework of the path approach everything is clearly written in terms of differences of energies , but the theory applies only to metropolis  like systems .",
    "our opinion is that it is interesting and it can also be very fruitful to understand the connections between these two approaches in order to mix the strength of the former with the simplicity of the latter . as a first step in this direction we prove the equivalence of the two approaches in the case of the metropolis dynamics , whose definition is now recalled .",
    "we consider a finite state space @xmath0 equipped with a function @xmath1 .",
    "sometimes for a point @xmath2 , we will write the _ energy _ of @xmath3 for the value @xmath4 .",
