    "x - ray images of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) produced by mosaicking pointed observations made with the _ rosat _ position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ; snowden & petre 1994 ) have revealed extensive x - ray emission associated with this irregular galaxy .",
    "the pspc mosaic of the lmc clearly exhibits diffuse x - ray emission on scales of @xmath11  3000  pc , in addition to discrete point sources such as foreground stars , lmc x - ray binaries , and background active galaxies .",
    "the diffuse x - ray emission is indicative of the presence of hot ( @xmath0  k ) interstellar gas .",
    "this hot gas component , corresponding to the hot ionized medium ( him ) component of mckee & ostriker s ( 1977 ) multi - phase interstellar medium ( ism ) , is most likely shock - heated by supernova blasts and the fast stellar winds of massive stars .",
    "some of this diffuse x - ray emission is associated with interstellar structures such as hii  regions , supernova remnants ( snrs ) , superbubbles , and supergiant shells , but some of the diffuse emission appears to be unbounded by any interstellar structure .",
    "the lmc offers an ideal site to study the nature and origin of the him , as well as its relationship to the other phases of the ism . at a distance of 50  kpc ,",
    "the lmc is near enough so that point sources can be unambiguously distinguished from small diffuse sources , e.g. , snrs , thus a wide range of diffuse x - ray sources can be analyzed . with an inclination angle of 30@xmath12 and a foreground extinction of a@xmath13 mag ( westerlund 1997 )",
    ", the lmc can be viewed with minimal confusion along the line - of - sight so that the relationship among all phases of the ism and the underlying stellar population can be studied .    as such",
    ", much work has been performed to understand the nature and origin of the diffuse x - ray emission from the lmc on all scales .",
    "williams et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have recently completed an atlas of 31 snrs in the lmc to examine the physical conditions of the 10@xmath14  k  gas on the micro - scale ( @xmath1  pc ) .",
    "dunne , points , & chu ( 2001 ) have examined the physical conditions of the hot gas interior to a sample of 13 x - ray bright superbubbles on the meso - scale ( @xmath15  pc ) .",
    "this paper addresses the physical properties of the @xmath0  k on the macro - scale ( @xmath16  pc ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section 2 describes the observations used in this study and their reduction .",
    "the distribution of the hot ( @xmath0  k ) plasma and its relationship to the warm ( @xmath17  k ) gas on a global scale and for individual objects is discussed in  3 . in ",
    "4 we determine the physical conditions of the @xmath0  k gas .",
    "we summarize our results in  5 .",
    "the x - ray mosaics of the lmc were obtained with the _ rosat _  x - ray telescope , using the pspc which has a 2  diameter field - of - view .",
    "the data were retrieved through the _ rosat _  public archive at the high energy astrophysics science archive research center ( heasarc ) at nasa s goddard space flight center .",
    "table  1 lists the observation sequences that were used for the pspc mosaics .",
    "the table includes the number of data sets for each sequence ( the observation of individual targets was often broken into multiple segments , some of which required separate processing ) , pointing direction , exposure time , and target name .",
    "the data reduction was accomplished using the extended source analysis software ( esas ) package ( snowden & kuntz 1998 ; kuntz & snowden 1998 ) , which is also available through the heasarc .",
    "the final pspc mosaics are cast in the zenith equal - area azimuthal ( zea ; greisen & calabretta 1996 ) projection , which is similar over this solid angle to tangential projection .",
    "this projection has a field center of @xmath18 5@xmath1928@xmath20 , @xmath21 , a pixel size of 40@xmath22 , and covers 51.27 square degrees .",
    "we present the pspc mosaic of the lmc in the r4 to r7 ( 0.44  2.04  kev ; see table  2 ) energy band and the exposure map for the r5 energy band ( 0.56  1.21  kev ) in figures  1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "reduction of the pspc data followed the procedures outlined by snowden et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and demonstrated by snowden & petre ( 1994 ) .",
    "in fact , the pspc mosaic presented in figure  1 includes a reprocessing of data presented by snowden & petre ( 1994 ) .",
    "this new mosaic was made from 129 pointed pspc observations , whereas the previous mosaic was made from @xmath23 pointed pspc observations .",
    "the individual observations were screened for anomalous background conditions , had their residual non - cosmic background components modeled and subtracted , and had their vignetted and deadtime - corrected exposures calculated . only after all of the individual observations were reduced in six statistically - independent energy bands ( see table  2 ) were they cast into the mosaics . because the analysis software can not correct for zero - level offsets ( a constant component of the long - term enhancement in the non - cosmic background , see snowden et al .",
    "1994 ) , the mosaicking process must correct for the relative offsets between overlapping fields .",
    "a single - value deconvolution algorithm was applied to a system of equations comprising the count rates for all overlaps between separate observations to determine a best fit for all offsets simultaneously .",
    "a final constraint was added so that the sum of the offsets were equal to zero .",
    "individual observations were then adjusted by multiplying the fitted offset by the exposure map to produce an offset count image , which was then subtracted from the count image .",
    "this procedure was run separately for each energy band .",
    "table  3 lists the average exposure time , the total counts , the total background counts , and the average intensity of each band .",
    "the true source counts can be seen to completely dominate the non - cosmic background and the average exposures are larger by more than an order of magnitude than that of the _ rosat _  all sky survey coverage .",
    "in this section we first describe the global distribution of the diffuse x - ray emission toward the lmc and compare it with the spatial distribution of @xmath24  k ionized gas in the lmc . based upon the x - ray images ,",
    "we show that the x - ray emission most likely has a hot @xmath25  k origin . from these images ,",
    "we select regions of large scale diffuse x - ray emission that have , in most cases , optical counterparts .",
    "finally , we examine the relationship between the hot and the warm ionized gas for the individual structures .",
    "as seen in figure  1 , the lmc clearly exhibits extensive diffuse emission in the r4 to r7 energy band .",
    "the diffuse x - ray emission in the lmc occurs on physical scales from @xmath1  pc to @xmath26  pc .",
    "observations of the lmc with the _ rosat _  high resolution imager ( hri ) do not show evidence that the large scale diffuse x - ray emission is produced by a population of point sources that were unresolved by the pspc , indicating a hot ( @xmath0  k ) gas origin ( chu & snowden 1998 ) .",
    "the x - ray surface brightness of the large - scale diffuse x - ray emission is non - uniform across the lmc .",
    "it varies from in the northwest to in the southeast in the r4 to r7 band .",
    "this range of x - ray surface brightness is comparable to that measured for lmc superbubbles ( _ cf . _",
    "dunne et al . 2001 ) , but is a factor of @xmath15 lower than that of lmc snrs ( _ cf . _  williams et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the large scale diffuse x - ray emission most likely originates in the lmc because it has a higher surface brightness than the nominal off - lmc value of @xmath27  counts  s@xmath28  arcmin@xmath29  in the r4 to r7 band mosaic ( snowden & petre 1994 ; snowden 1999 ) .",
    "we have compared the pspc x - ray mosaic of the lmc with the h@xmath30  sky survey image ( gaustad et al .",
    "1999 ) of the lmc ( figure  3 ) to identify the @xmath24  k ionized gas counterparts , if any , of the large scale diffuse x - ray emission . as can be seen by comparing figures  1 and 3 , some of the large scale diffuse x - ray emission",
    "is associated with lmc supergiant shells ( e.g. , lmc2 ) , further suggesting a hot gas origin .",
    "some of the diffuse x - ray emission , however , appears to be unbounded by any interstellar structure ( e.g. , the spur and the lmc bar ) .",
    "the regions of large scale diffuse x - ray emission toward the lmc that we have selected for study , as well as their positions , physical sizes , and the measured galactic and lmc hi  column densities , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively , toward them are presented in table  4 .",
    "the designations of the regions of large scale diffuse x - ray emission presented in table  4 are taken to correspond with names given to their optical counterparts , where appropriate .",
    "below we describe the spatial distribution of the @xmath24  k gas and compare it with the distribution of the @xmath0  k gas for the regions of large scale diffuse x - ray emission listed in table  4 .",
    "we first discuss the distribution of the @xmath24  k ionized gas and then the @xmath0  k gas of the selected regions because it is often useful to use the optical features as a reference for the x - ray emission .",
    "the h@xmath30  images of the regions have been extracted from the pds scans of the curtis schmidt plates of kennicutt & hodge ( 1986 ) .",
    "the two exceptions for this are ( 1 ) lmc1 , which is not covered by the pds scans , and ( 2 ) the lmc bar region , which covers more than one pds scan field - of - view . for lmc1",
    ", the h@xmath30  image has been mosaicked from images obtained by the magellanic cloud emission - line survey ( mcels ; smith et al .",
    "for the lmc bar , the image has been extracted from the h@xmath30  sky survey ( gaustad et al .",
    "1999 ) image of the lmc .",
    "the x - ray images for the individual objects have been extracted from the pspc mosaic of the lmc ( figure  1 ) .",
    "we present the h@xmath30  and pspc x - ray images of the individual objects in figures  4  12 .",
    "the gray - scale levels among the images are not the same so that the objects with lower x - ray and h@xmath30  surface brightness can be seen more clearly . to aid in the comparison between the @xmath24  k and @xmath33  k gas for each object",
    "we have plotted x - ray contours at the 3 , 5 , 10 , 15 , and 20-@xmath34 level above the local background . because the selected regions cover a large spatial extent , smaller scale x - ray sources ( e.g. , x - ray binaries , snrs , and superbubbles ) also lie projected along the line - of - sight .",
    "therefore , we have also plotted additional contour levels at 50 , 100 , 150 , and 200-@xmath34 level above the mean local background .",
    "these contours are plotted as dashed lines .",
    "small - scale features mentioned in the text such as hii  regions , snrs , and superbubbles have also been labeled .",
    "the h@xmath30  image of lmc1 ( figure  4a ) shows a very coherent shell structure with a diameter of @xmath35  pc .",
    "the northern and eastern filaments of lmc1 are better defined than the filaments in the west and south .",
    "a single hii  region ( n13 ) lies projected toward the southeastern side of lmc1 .",
    "diffuse x - ray emission is detected interior to the h@xmath30  filaments defining lmc1 .",
    "the diffuse x - ray emission from within lmc1 seems to fill the shell in the area covered by the pspc mosaic ( figure  4b ) . the diffuse x - ray emission from within lmc1 peaks in the western portion of the shell and along the southern rim .",
    "some of the diffuse x - ray emission extends beyond the ionized filaments in the southwest , suggesting a blowout of the hot gas .",
    "high resolution hi  aperture synthesis images of lmc1 ( kim et al .",
    "1999 ) show hi  filaments extending beyond the x - ray emission region , indicating that the hot gas is confined by the hi  gas .",
    "the distribution of @xmath24  k ionized gas toward lmc2 is revealed in the h@xmath30  image ( see figure  5a ) .",
    "this image shows long filaments in the north and the east and shorter filaments in the south .",
    "together , these filaments suggest a coherent shell structure with a diameter of @xmath36  pc . lmc2 is bordered on its western edge by the most active star formation complex in the lmc : n157 ( 30  doradus ) , n158 , n160 , and n159 .",
    "in addition to this ridge of star formation , many other hii  regions lie along the periphery or are projected interior to lmc2 .",
    "two snrs are projected near the periphery of lmc2 : dem  l  299 at the northern border and dem  l  316 in the southeast ( mathewson et al .",
    "1983 ; williams et al .",
    "diffuse x - ray emission is detected interior to the ionized filaments that define the boundary of lmc2 .",
    "the spatial distribution of x - ray emission and the physical properties of the hot gas toward lmc2 have been extensively studied ( wang & helfand 1991 ; points et al .",
    "1999 ; points et al .",
    "2000 ) ; therefore , we summarize those results here .",
    "lmc2 has the highest x - ray surface brightness of all the supergiant shells in the lmc ; the peak of the diffuse emission is approximately 35 times higher than the off - lmc background .",
    "the diffuse x - ray emission from within lmc2 is confined by the filaments to the north and east , but extends beyond the southern filaments in a bright x - ray spur ( see figure  11 and  3.2.8 ) .",
    "the diffuse x - ray emission toward lmc2 is non - uniform .",
    "a bright x - ray arc is seen in the southwest that appears to extend from n158 to n159 , centered on n160 .",
    "a region of lower x - ray surface brightness lies between the x - ray arc and a region of bright emission in the northeast .",
    "the bright x - ray arc in the southwest has been suggested as a blowout of hot gas from n160 into lmc2 .",
    "the region of low x - ray surface brightness ( @xmath37 5@xmath1945@xmath20 , @xmath38 ) is likely caused by absorption from an hi  cloud on the front side of lmc2 .",
    "the bright northern region is probably energized by an snr shock interior to lmc2 hitting the shell wall . as seen in figure  5b ,",
    "discrete x - ray emission sources are located toward lmc2 .",
    "these sources include 30  doradus , snrs ( i.e. , snr  0540@xmath3969.3 , dem  l  299 , & dem  l  316 ) and a high mass x - ray binary ( i.e. , lmc  x-1 ) .",
    "the h@xmath30  image of lmc3 ( figure  6a ) shows an intricate filamentary shell structure to the northwest of the 30  doradus star formation complex with a diameter @xmath16  pc .",
    "the ionized filaments do not have the coherence of those seen in lmc1 and lmc2 , but are suggestive of a complete shell structure .",
    "several hii  regions lie along the periphery of lmc3 and appear to be connected by the ionized filaments .",
    "diffuse x - ray emission is detected toward lmc3 .",
    "the diffuse x - ray emission toward lmc3 covers the interior of the supergiant shell ( see figure  6b ) .",
    "the x - ray surface brightness of the diffuse emission is non - uniform .",
    "the diffuse x - ray emission peaks along the eastern rim of lmc3 .",
    "several local depressions in the x - ray surface brightness are also seen in the pspc mosaic toward lmc3 .",
    "two of these minima are coincident with hii  regions projected toward lmc3 : n148 ( dem  l  227 ) along the northern rim and dem  l  210 toward the center .",
    "these two depressions are more pronounced in the r4@xmath40r5 energy band than in the r6@xmath40r7 energy band , indicative of absorption .",
    "therefore , it is likely that n148 and dem  l  210 lie on the front side of lmc3 .",
    "in addition to the large scale diffuse x - ray emission associated with lmc3 , discrete x - ray sources such as foreground stars , snrs ( e.g. , snr 0528@xmath39692 ) , and superbubbles ( e.g. , n144 ) are seen in figure  6b .",
    "lmc4 is the largest optically identified supergiant shell in the lmc with a dimension of 1400  pc @xmath41 1000  pc .",
    "lmc4 consists of fragmented ionized gas filaments that seem to connect the numerous hiiregions along its periphery , suggesting a coherent shell structure ( figure  7a ) .",
    "diffuse x - ray emission is detected within lmc4 .",
    "the physical conditions of the hot ( @xmath0  k ) gas interior to lmc4 have been reported by bomans , dennerl , & krster ( 1994 ) .",
    "the pspc mosaic of lmc4 ( figure  7b ) shows very low surface brightness emission .",
    "lmc4 has a a low foreground hi  column density of  @xmath42  cm@xmath29 .",
    "therefore , the absence of strong x - ray emission detected toward lmc4 is not caused by absorption .",
    "in general , the x - ray emission from the interior of lmc4 appears limb - brightened , but the brightest diffuse x - ray emission in the west and south rims is only a factor of @xmath44 brighter than the x - ray emission from the center of the supergiant shell .",
    "the x - ray emission from the western side of lmc4 is not associated with any h@xmath30  emission features and is probably gas interior to lmc4 .",
    "the diffuse x - ray emission detected toward the southern boundary of lmc4 , however , is more confusing .",
    "this emission is most likely associated with the superbubbles that border lmc4 along the southern rim , such as n51 and n57 .",
    "discrete x - ray sources , such as an x - ray binary ( i.e. , lmc  x-4 ) , and snrs ( i.e. , n49 , n49b , dem  l  241 , & n63a ) are also seen in the pspc mosaic image .",
    "the h@xmath30  image of lmc5 ( figure  8a ) shows faint , irregular ionized filaments with a diameter of @xmath45  pc to the northwest of lmc4 .",
    "a long ionized filament ( @xmath46  pc long ) appears to bisect the lmc5 , giving the impression that lmc5 is comprised of two distinct shells .",
    "the diffuse x - ray emission from lmc5 covers most of its interior ( see figure  8b ) .",
    "the brightest diffuse x - ray emission from lmc5 is located to the south of the h@xmath30  filament that divides the shell .",
    "the bright diffuse x - ray emission at the south rim can not be unambiguously associated with lmc5 , however , because it lies projected toward an hii  region ( n48 ) .",
    "a region of lower x - ray surface brightness is seen along the western rim of the shell , coincident with the h@xmath30  filaments .",
    "the lowered x - ray surface brightness may be the result of the ionized gas absorbing the x - ray emission from inside the supergiant shell .",
    "the strong x - ray sources to the east of lmc5 are the snrs , n49 and n49b .",
    "the x - ray sources to the west of the lmc5 are two foreground galactic late - type stars .",
    "the warm ionized shell of lmc6 is very faint and circular in appearance , with a diameter of @xmath47  pc ( see figure  9a ) .",
    "it is the smallest supergiant shell in the lmc ( meaburn 1980 ) .",
    "the surface brightness of the ionized filaments is highest toward the hiiregions n91 and n92 along the northern and southern boundaries , respectively .",
    "in addition to these hii  regions , the snr n86 is projected on the western rim of lmc6 .",
    "the spatial distribution of the x - ray emitting plasma from lmc6 appears limb - brightened ( see figure  9b ) .",
    "lmc6 has a very low x - ray surface brightness , @xmath48 times the off - lmc background .",
    "the peak diffuse x - ray emission toward lmc6 lies toward n91 and may be associated with the hii  region .",
    "the bright , discrete x - ray sources toward lmc6 are the n86 snr and a late - type galactic star .",
    "the large scale structure designated as lmc10 was tentatively identified as a supergiant shell candidate by meaburn ( 1980 ) .",
    "these faint ionized filaments lie to the north of 30  doradus and lmc3 ( figure  10a ) .",
    "the h@xmath30  morphology of the lmc10 show the filaments to be pointing away from 30  doradus and lmc3 , particularly in the area toward n148 along the northeastern rim of lmc3 .",
    "the pspc mosaic of lmc10 ( figure  10b ) shows an arc of x - ray emission that stretches from the northern edge of lmc3 and may continue toward the southern edge of lmc4 .",
    "the x - ray emission from this arc has a fairly high surface brightness , with a peak approximately 5 times the off - lmc background .",
    "the extent of the x - ray emission of lmc10 can not be measured in our pspc images because of incomplete coverage of the mosaic toward its central region .",
    "the x - ray spur in the lmc lies to the south of the supergiant shell lmc2 ( see figure  1 ) . the h@xmath30  image of the spur ( figure  11a ) shows several hii  along its western edge , but does not reveal any 10@xmath49  k  ionized filaments encompassing it .",
    "thus , its boundaries and physical size are defined solely from the pspc mosaic . even though little @xmath24  k ionized gas is detected toward the spur ,",
    "other phases of the ism are present .",
    "observations of the @xmath50co @xmath51 emission line at 2.6  mm made with the nanten 4-m radio telescope ( fukui et al .",
    "1999 ) reveal that the spur is bordered on the west by a ridge of molecular gas .",
    "the hii  regions along the western edge are superposed on this molecular ridge .",
    "the pspc mosaic image ( figure  11b ) reveals that the spur has a physical size of @xmath36  pc , comparable to lmc2 .",
    "the spur has the second highest average x - ray surface brightness of all the objects in this study .",
    "it has been suggested that the spur represents a blowout of the hot gas interior to lmc2 into the halo of the lmc ( wang & helfand 1991 ) although high - resolution optical spectra toward the spur do not reveal any high - velocity gas that would be indicative of an outflow ( points et al .",
    "very little structure or variation in the x - ray surface brightness is observed toward the spur .",
    "this is remarkable because lmc2 shows x - ray surface brightness variations on smaller scales that are caused by differential absorption ( points et al .",
    "1999 ; points et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the smooth distribution of x - ray emission from the spur may imply a very uniform foreground absorption .",
    "the western boundary of the spur is coincident with the ridge of molecular gas .",
    "this molecular material could be absorbing x - ray emission from the spur and be responsible for the sharp western edge of the x - ray emission .",
    "the lmc bar primarily consists of an intermediate - age stellar population upon which many hii  regions are superposed ( see figure  12a ) such as n113 , n114 , n119 , and n120 .",
    "the x - ray bar of the lmc is the largest region of diffuse x - ray emission reported here with a major axis @xmath52  pc and a minor axis @xmath53  pc .",
    "the pspc mosaic ( figure  12b ) shows bright large - scale diffuse gas from the bar region of the lmc .",
    "the hri survey of the lmc ( chu & snowden 1998 ) does not show large population of point sources that are unresolved by the pspc .",
    "we note , however , that the _ rosat _  hri survey of the lmc has a detection limit of @xmath54  erg  s@xmath28 for point sources ( chu & snowden 1998 ) .",
    "thus , some of the x - ray emission from the lmc bar could consist of point sources that were unresolved by the pspc , but not detected by the hri because of its high background .",
    "if the x - ray emission from the lmc bar is produced by coronal emission from unresolved late - type stars in the lmc bar , the stellar density of this population would be @xmath55  pc@xmath56 , which is unrealistically high .",
    "therefore , the x - ray emission from the lmc bar appears to be truly diffuse . in general , the x - ray emission is not spatially correlated with the star forming regions superposed on the lmc bar .",
    "discrete x - ray sources such as snrs ( e.g. , snr  0519@xmath39690 , snr  0520@xmath39694 , n,120 , and n132  d ) and foreground stars are seen projected toward the lmc bar .",
    "before the physical conditions of the @xmath0  k gas can be determined , we must first excise the discrete x - ray emission sources , such as foreground galactic stars , lmc x - ray binaries , snrs , and superbubbles , and background active galactic nuclei , from all of the pspc mosaic band images . for this purpose",
    ", we used the catalog of _ rosat _  pspc x - ray sources toward the lmc that was compiled by haberl & pietsch ( 1999 ) to obtain the positions of the discrete sources .",
    "after the contaminating sources were removed from the mosaics , the background - subtracted pspc count rates are determined for the regions of large scale diffuse x - ray emission in each pspc band .",
    "the count rates in the individual bands were then summed to obtain count rates in the r4 @xmath40 r5 ( 0.44  1.21  kev ) and r6 @xmath40 r7 ( 0.73  2.04  kev ) energy bands .",
    "the angular size of the extraction regions , net source count rates in the pspc energy bands and the @xmath57 ratio for the regions of large scale diffuse x - ray emission are presented in table  5 .",
    "the measured x - ray surface brightness of the hot gas is dependent upon the temperature of the thermal plasma and the foreground absorption .",
    "if the foreground absorption can be independently measured , the intensity ratio between the different bands can be used to determine the temperature of the emitting gas .",
    "we use a raymond & smith ( 1977 ) thermal plasma emission model with 40% solar abundance to interpret the @xmath58 band intensity ratios of the selected regions as an effective temperature of the hot plasma associated with them .",
    "we use measurements of the galactic and lmc hi  column densities from the data presented by dickey & lockman ( 1990 ) and rohlfs et al .",
    "( 1984 ) respectively , to determine lower and upper limits on the total foreground absorption column to the regions of interest in the lmc .",
    "as seen in table  4 , the galactic hi  column density , @xmath59 , ranges from @xmath60  cm@xmath29 .",
    "arabadjis & bregman ( 1999 ) have shown that for column densities",
    "@xmath61  cm@xmath29 , the total x - ray absorption column is nearly double the hi  column density because of the contribution of molecular gas .",
    "although molecular gas does contribute to the total absorption column above column densities @xmath62  cm@xmath29 , it is neither a factor of 2 uniformly over the sky , nor a step function at @xmath63  cm@xmath29 .",
    "thus , the contribution to the total absorption column by the galactic ism probably ranges from 1 to 2 times @xmath59 . continuing this approximation to the lmc absorption column is more difficult .",
    "measurements of the lmc hicolumn density sample material that is both in front of and behind the regions of interest .",
    "we use the simplifying assumption that half of the neutral atomic gas is foreground to the regions and that half is background .",
    "thus , the lmc component of the total absorption column density is @xmath64 .",
    "the total absorption column is between @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "we use both of these limiting values of the foreground absorption to determine the physical conditions of the @xmath0  k gas in the regions of interest .",
    "figure  13 shows a plot of the pspc @xmath58 band ratio versus  for a set of 40% solar abundance raymond & smith ( 1977 ) plasma emission models with temperatures ranging from @xmath67 ( or @xmath68  kev ) . for the selected regions of large scale diffuse x - ray emission in the lmc , the plasma temperature varies from @xmath69  kev . as seen in figure  13 , the errors in the @xmath70 band ratios imply that the supergiant shell lmc2 could have a plasma temperature ranging from @xmath71 to 0.68  kev if the foreground absorption is @xmath72  cm@xmath29 for a raymond & smith ( 1977 ) 40% solar abundance plasma emission model .",
    "this range in plasma temperature for the hot gas interior to lmc2 is similar to the 90% confidence limits on the plasma temperature that were determined by thermal plasma model fits to _ rosat _",
    "pspc spectra of lmc2 ( points et al . 2000 ) .    from the determination of the plasma temperatures and the measured foreground absorption , we use pimms ( mukai 1993 ) to calculate the unabsorbed x - ray fluxes , and hence x - ray luminosities , of the regions in the r4 to r7 energy band .",
    "given a hot gas filling factor , @xmath73 , volume , @xmath74 , x - ray luminosity , @xmath75 , and emissivity , @xmath76 , the electron density of the hot plasma will be @xmath77 if @xmath78 . for the selected regions , we assume that the volume of the gas is equal to the product of the surface area and the path length through the gas .",
    "we adopt a path length comparable to the width of the region in question .",
    "we derive the electron densities for the large scale diffuse x - ray emission regions using the calculated x - ray luminosities and emissivities and present them in table  6 .",
    "the average electron densities in these regions varies from @xmath79  @xmath6 in lmc4 to @xmath80  @xmath6 in the lmc spur .",
    "the preceding derivation of the physical conditions of the hot gas associated with the large scale diffuse x - ray emission in the lmc is not without its caveats .",
    "the major uncertainties in our calculations do not arise from uncertainties in the measured count rates , but are attributed to the assumptions we have made concerning the metallicity of the x - ray emitting gas , the geometry of the emitting region and the foreground absorption . for example , the canonical chemical abundance of the ism in the lmc is 30% of the solar value ( russell & dopita 1992 ) . in this work , however , we have determined the physical conditions of the hot gas using a raymond & smith ( 1977 ) thermal plasma with 40% solar abundance because pimms does not have a grid of 30% solar abundance raymond & smith ( 1977 ) models .",
    "therefore , we have calculated the plasma temperatures , x - ray luminosities , and electron densities of the selected regions using a raymond & smith ( 1977 ) thermal plasma with 20% solar abundance to investigate the importance of the chemical abundance on the physical conditions of the hot gas .",
    "this work shows that the mean percent difference in plasma temperatures between raymond & smith ( 1977 ) models with 20% and 40% solar abundances is @xmath81 for the individual objects , but that the mean percent differences in the x - ray fluxes and electron densities are @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "another complicating factor in calculating the physical properties of the 10@xmath14  k gas is the uncertainty in the three dimensional geometry , or volume , of the individual regions .",
    "therefore , we simply take the volume to be the product of the projected surface area and the path length through the gas where the path length is equal to the width of the structure . because the depth through these structures is uncertain , an increase ( decrease ) of the path length , @xmath84 , by a factor of two , would decrease ( increase ) our determination of the electron density by a factor of @xmath85 .",
    "the final assumption that we have made is that the foreground absorption column toward the individual regions of interest is uniform and can be represented as a combination of the galactic and lmc hicolumn densities .",
    "we have shown in  3.2 that some of the fluctuations in the x - ray surface brightness toward the individual objects are associated with differential absorption .",
    "therefore , the assumption of uniform absorption across each region is clearly not correct if we want to investigate the variations in plasma temperature and electron density across each region of interest .",
    "thus , we only can determine the average physical conditions of the hot gas in the regions .",
    "in addition to determining the physical properties of the @xmath0  k gas in our sample of selected objects , we have also investigated the contribution of these objects to the total x - ray emission observed from the lmc .",
    "this comparison will allow us to better understand the x - ray emission from more distant magellanic irregular galaxies with star formation rates of 0.26 m@xmath86  yr@xmath28 ( kennicutt et al .",
    "as previously discussed , the x - ray emission from the pspc mosaics is comprised of emission from : ( 1 ) agn and background galaxies , ( 2 ) foreground stars , ( 3 ) the soft x - ray background , and ( 4 ) lmc sources ( e.g. , x - ray binaries , snrs , superbubbles , supergiant shells , and field emission ) .",
    "therefore , in order to determine the amount of x - ray emission that is intrinsic to the lmc , we must determine and subtract the contributions of the background galaxies , foreground stars , and the soft x - ray background from the pspc mosaic .",
    "below we discuss the removal of these different sources from pspc mosaics and determine the x - ray emission that is attributed to sources in the lmc .    the first step in calculating the diffuse x - ray emission from the lmc is determining the soft x - ray background toward the lmc in the r1 to r7 ( 0.1  2.04  kev ) energy band and subtracting it from the pspc mosaics . to determine the soft x - ray background in this energy range we have created two broadband x - ray images of the lmc : the first in the r4 to r7 ( 0.44  2.04  kev ) energy band ( see figure  1 ) and the second in the r1 to r2 ( 0.1  0.28  kev ) energy band ( see figure  1 of snowden 1999 ) .",
    "the off - lmc background in the r4 to r7 band has been previously measured by snowden & petre ( 1994 ) to be @xmath87  counts  s@xmath28  arcmin@xmath29 .",
    "unfortunately , there are no published values of the off - lmc background in the r1 to r2 band ; therefore , we need to measure the value of the background directly from the r1 to r2 mosaic of the lmc . to accomplish this task ,",
    "we have determined the mean count rate in 10 regions , each having an angular extent of 10 arcmin@xmath88 , along the periphery of the r4 to r7 pspc mosaic .",
    "the average background measured in these 10 regions is @xmath89  counts  s@xmath28  arcmin@xmath29 , in good agreement with the value reported by snowden & petre ( 1994 ) .",
    "somewhat confident that these 10 regions are representative of the off - lmc background in the r4 to r7 band , we use them to determine the off - lmc background to be @xmath90  counts  s@xmath28  arcmin@xmath29  in the r1 to r2 band  counts  s@xmath28  arcmin@xmath29  toward the north galactic pole ( kuntz & snowden 2000 ) .",
    "snowden et al .",
    "( 1998 ) note that the soft x - ray emission in the northern hemisphere is @xmath91 times stronger than in the southern hemisphere in this energy range .",
    "the value we determined for the background in the r1 to r2 band is within 20% of the expected background of @xmath92  counts  s@xmath28  arcmin@xmath29 . ] .",
    "after the off - lmc backgrounds in the r4 to r7 and r1 to r2 energy bands are subtracted , we combine the resulting images to make a mosaic of the lmc in the r1 to r7 energy band .",
    "now that the background has been subtracted from the pspc mosaic in the r1 to r7 energy band , we use the list of x - ray sources toward the lmc compiled by haberl & pietsch ( 1999 ) to determine the contribution of discrete , point - like sources ( e.g. , agn , foreground stars , x - ray binaries , supersoft x - ray sources , snrs , and unclassified x - ray sources ) to the total emission in the pspc mosaics .",
    "we have also taken the list of superbubbles in the lmc compiled by dunne et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and the list of large scale structures discussed in  3 to determine their contribution to the total emission in the pspc mosaic .",
    "after the contributions from all of these sources are subtracted from the total x - ray emission in the background - subtracted pspc mosaic , we are left with the diffuse x - ray emission from the field of the lmc .",
    "we present these results in table  7 .",
    "as seen in table  7 , the largest contribution to the x - ray emission from the lmc comes from x - ray binaries and supersoft x - ray sources ( 41% ) .",
    "surprisingly , the second largest contribution to x - ray emission from the lmc is from diffuse gas in the field ( 29% ) .",
    "this is slightly higher than the x - ray emission produced by snrs ( 21% of the total ) and three times the amount of x - ray emission associated with supergiant shells , the spur and the bar .",
    "diffuse x - ray emission from superbubbles makes a small contribution to the total x - ray emission from the lmc ( 2% ) .    as with any calculation , we must consider the factors that produce uncertainties .",
    "the largest source of error in the determination of of total x - ray emission from the lmc , and hence the emission from diffuse gas in the field is the value of the off - lmc x - ray background in the r1 to r2 energy band .",
    "if the off - lmc background in the r1 to r2 band is one half of the x - ray background in the r1 to r2 band observed toward the north galactic pole ( see kuntz & snowden 2000 ) , then the contribution of diffuse x - ray emission from the field to the total x - ray emission from the lmc drops from 27% to 20% of the total .",
    "this is primarily a consequence of the method by which we determined the amount of diffuse x - ray emission from the field . to determine the count rate for the field emission we subtracted the emission from the cataloged sources from the total emission in the background - subtracted pspc mosaic .",
    "we attribute the difference between the total x - ray emission in the lmc and the cataloged sources to be from diffuse gas in the field .",
    "thus , by increasing the soft x - ray background in the r1 to r2 energy band , we decrease the total number of counts in the pspc mosaic , effectively reducing the amount of diffuse x - ray emission from the field .",
    "another source of potential error in the determination of the amount of x - ray emission intrinsic to the lmc is errors in the count rates we determined from the pspc mosaics for the cataloged superbubbles in the lmc ( _ cf .",
    "_ , dunne et al . 2001 ) and the objects listed in  3 . to check the accuracy of our source extraction from the mosaics ,",
    "we have also determined the count rates of the cataloged snrs and x - ray binaries in the lmc and compared these values with those determined by haberl & pietsch ( 1999 ) .",
    "the total count rates that we determined for snrs and x - ray binaries are within 5% of those determined by haberl & pietsch ( 1999 ) . therefore , we conclude that our method of extracting source counts directly from the pspc mosaics does not significantly affect our determination of the total x - ray emission from the lmc and that the largest source of error lies in the determination of the off - lmc background . finally , there is also considerable uncertainty due to the foreground absorption to the lmc .",
    "the galactic hi  column densities toward the lmc are @xmath93  cm@xmath29 , corresponding to 4  5 optical depths at @xmath94  kev .",
    "thus , small errors in the assumed foreground absorption can have large effects on the determined pspc count rates .",
    "the pspc mosaics of the lmc provide an unprecedented and detailed global view of the @xmath0  k gas in a galaxy .",
    "the diffuse x - ray emission is non - uniform across lmc and shows a highly complex ism with features on the scale from a few arcminutes to over several degrees .",
    "furthermore , these x - ray mosaics allow us to examine the spatial distribution and physical conditions of diffuse x - ray emission on scales larger than a single pointed pspc observation allows .",
    "we have selected regions of large - scale x - ray emission in the lmc and compared them with h@xmath30  images .",
    "this comparison shows that while some of the large scale diffuse x - ray emission is associated with supergiant shells , some is also unbounded such as the lmc spur , and the lmc bar .",
    "we have determined the physical properties of these regions of large scale diffuse emission .",
    "we find that the plasma temperature varies from @xmath95 to @xmath96  kev and the x - ray surface brightness varies from @xmath97  @xmath98  erg  cm@xmath29  s@xmath28  arcmin@xmath29 .",
    "the electron density of the hot gas in these regions varies from 0.003  @xmath6 to 0.030  @xmath6 .",
    "we have determined the x - ray count rate from the lmc in the r1 to r7 energy band .",
    "discrete sources , such as foreground stars , agn , x - ray binaries , snrs , and superbubbles , were removed . from this",
    "we are able to determine the x - ray count rate from the selected regions and from the field .",
    "we find that x - ray emission from the field of the lmc contributes between 20% to 27% of the total x - ray emission from the lmc , depending on how the x - ray background is removed .",
    "the diffuse x - ray emission from the field provides a significant contribution to the total x - ray luminosity of the lmc .",
    "it is comparable to the amount of x - ray emission associated with snrs in the lmc and is a factor of 2 to 3 times greater than the x - ray emission associated with supergiant shells , the spur , and the bar in the lmc .",
