    "<S> flow dynamics have been probed by combining standard rheology , e.g. through the determination of the `` constitutive relation '' between the shear stress @xmath2 and the shear rate @xmath3 , and local structural or velocity measurements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while much progress has been made on _ steady - state _ local flow properties @xcite , _ transient _ regimes upon shear start - up have been addressed only recently @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> still , in practice , it can be argued that any experimental determination of the flow curve @xmath4 is effectively transient since it is obtained by sweeping up or down @xmath3 over a finite temporal window . in other words </S>",
    "<S> the measured flow curve coincides with the steady - state relation @xmath4 _ only if _ the sweep rate is slow enough compared to any intrinsic timescale of the fluid . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise one expects hysteresis loops in @xmath4 measurements performed by sweeping up then down the shear rate ( or vice versa ) . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon , known as `` rheological hysteresis , '' has been commonly observed in a host of complex fluids for about 70 years @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , to date , this ubiquitous signature of the interplay between timescales in complex fluids has not been quantitatively studied by means of local measurements .    in this letter , we use time - resolved velocimetry to unveil the local scenario involved in rheological hysteresis in various types of well - studied soft materials . building upon a systematic experimental protocol </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce two observables , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , that quantify the amplitude of the hysteresis phenomenon as a function of the sweep rate @xmath0 in macroscopic rheology and local velocity respectively . both @xmath5 and @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> go through a maximum with @xmath1 , pointing to the existence of a characteristic timescale @xmath7 for the microstructure dynamics . in thixotropic ( laponite ) suspensions and ( carbon black ) gels , @xmath7 is of the order of several hundreds of seconds , while it becomes hardly measurable for simple yield stress fluids such as carbopol and concentrated emulsions . </S>",
    "<S> velocity profiles allow us to understand this evolution by clearly differentiating a succession of homogeneous , shear - banded , and arrested flows depending on the fluid and on the sweep rate , thus providing a local interpretation of rheological hysteresis .    _ </S>",
    "<S> experimental set - up and protocol.- _ experiments are performed in a polished plexiglas couette geometry ( typical roughness 15  nm , height 28 mm , rotating inner cylinder of radius 24 mm , fixed outer cylinder of radius 25 mm , gap @xmath8  mm ) equipped with a home - made lid to minimize evaporation . </S>",
    "<S> rheological data are recorded with a stress - controlled rheometer ( mcr 301 , anton paar ) . </S>",
    "<S> two flow curves are successively recorded , first by decreasing the shear rate @xmath3 from high shear ( @xmath9  s@xmath10 ) to low shear ( @xmath11  s@xmath10 ) through @xmath12 successive logarithmically - spaced steps of duration @xmath1 each , and then by immediately increasing @xmath3 back from @xmath13 up to the initial value @xmath14 following the same @xmath15 steps in reverse order . in general the downward and upward flow curves , @xmath16 and @xmath17 </S>",
    "<S> do not coincide and define a _ </S>",
    "<S> hysteresis loop_. simultaneously to the flow curves , the azimuthal velocity @xmath18 is measured as a function of the radial distance @xmath19 to the rotor , at about 15  mm from the cell bottom , and with a spatial resolution of 40  @xmath20 m by means of ultrasonic velocimetry @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> velocity data are then averaged over the duration @xmath1 of each shear - rate step at @xmath3 and the corresponding velocity profiles @xmath21 and @xmath22 are normalized by the rotor velocity @xmath23 to allow for a direct comparison of flow properties at widely different shear rates @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we checked that at @xmath14 velocity profiles are all linear with no fluctuation so that the flow reaches a steady state within the time interval @xmath1 , even for the fastest sweep rates . </S>",
    "<S> therefore starting from high enough shear rates ensures a well - defined and reproducible initial condition . </S>",
    "<S> our choice of @xmath13 and @xmath15 results from a compromise between good sampling and reasonable total duration . by monitoring the viscoelastic moduli prior to and after each experiment </S>",
    "<S> , we checked that evaporation and/or irreversible ( chemical ) aging of the sample were negligible even for the slowest sweeps ( @xmath24  s , @xmath25  h ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , approximating our step - like protocol by a continuous sweep , the equivalent sweep rate is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the number of steps per decade . in the present protocol </S>",
    "<S> we fix @xmath28 and identify the sweep rate with @xmath0 , while keeping in mind that @xmath29 is the actual control parameter ( see fig .  1 in supplemental material ) .        </S>",
    "<S> laponite suspension.- _ clay suspensions are well known to exhibit large rheological hysteresis @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we focus on laponite samples prepared by mixing ultrapure water with 3%  wt . of laponite powder ( rockwood , grade rd ) and 0.3%  </S>",
    "<S> wt . of hollow glass spheres ( sphericel , potters ) acting as acoustic contrast agents @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig.1 ] shows the hysteresis loops for @xmath30 , 10 , and 100  s. to quantify their areas , we introduce the following observable : @xmath31 where @xmath32 . note that the logarithmic sampling of @xmath33 gives an equal weight to low and high shear rates . </S>",
    "<S> strikingly , when the sweep rate is decreased , i.e. when @xmath1 is increased , @xmath34 goes through a maximum at @xmath35  s [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.1](d ) ] . to uncover the local scenario underlying this non - monotonic behavior of @xmath34 </S>",
    "<S> , we turn to time - resolved velocity profiles . in a way similar to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq.asigma ] ) , we consider @xmath36 , and integrate it over the gap and then over the range of explored shear rates : @xmath37 as shown in fig .  [ fig.1](e ) , the evolution of this local observable @xmath6 with @xmath1 directly reflects that of the area @xmath5 extracted from the sole global rheology and its maximum is reached for a similar value of @xmath35  s. this suggests that the behavior of @xmath34 results from the bulk flow properties at the mesoscopic scale . more precisely , for small values of @xmath1 , the laponite suspension is quickly `` quenched '' from high shear rates to lower ones . </S>",
    "<S> velocity profiles ( see also supplementary movies ) are all linear both on the way down and on the way up even at the smallest shear rates [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.1](a ) ] : the laponite suspension is not given enough time to restructure and remains fluid throughout the whole cycle , which leads to vanishingly small values of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> for intermediate values of @xmath1 , the velocity profiles along the two flow curves now strongly differ [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.1](b ) ] : while they remain linear during the downward sweep , they become inhomogeneous during the upward sweep and exhibit shear banding over a large range of shear rates . here , the suspension is given enough time to restructure leading to an arrested band subject to physical aging close to the fixed wall at @xmath38 , that progressively disappears as the shear rate is increased . </S>",
    "<S> this contributes to increase @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , for large values of @xmath1 , flow arrest also occurs along the downward sweep , which tends to decrease @xmath6 [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.1](c ) ] : shear banding is observed for @xmath391  s@xmath10 until the system experiences total slippage at the rotor ( i.e. @xmath40 everywhere in the bulk ) for @xmath41  s@xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> this fully arrested state persists on the upward sweep up to much higher shear rates ( @xmath42  s@xmath10 ) and gives way to a homogeneously sheared state above a small interval of shear rates that corresponds to decreasing shear stresses and to inhomogeneous flows . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario is robust and does not significantly depend on the boundary conditions or on sample age since preparation ( see figs .  2 and 3 in supplemental material ) . </S>",
    "<S> as discussed below , we suggest that the characteristic time @xmath43  s results from the competition between physical aging ( restructuration ) and shear rejuvenation ( structure break up ) @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ carbopol microgel.- _ let us turn to a simple yield stress fluid , namely a carbopol microgel , where restructuration is expected to be fast @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> results are reported in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the global observable @xmath5 is of the same order as for the laponite suspension @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> still , in the case of carbopol , @xmath5 is monotonically decreasing over the range of explored @xmath1 [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.2](c ) ] . here </S>",
    "<S> again the local observable @xmath6 follows the exact same trend [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.2](d ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> velocity profiles reveal that the local scenario remains qualitatively the same whatever the sweep rate : homogeneous shear flow is observed along most of the downward sweep together with an ever - increasing amount of wall slip . for @xmath44  s@xmath10 the local shear rate vanishes and the flow becomes pluglike at roughly half the rotor velocity . on the way up , </S>",
    "<S> pluglike flow gives way to shear - banded profiles right after the stress maximum and eventually to linear profiles at high shear rates [ see insets in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.2](a , b ) and movies in the supplemental material ] , consistently with previous reports on startup experiments at constant shear rate @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , as @xmath1 is increased , the range of shear rates over which shear banding is observed gets narrower , leading to smaller values of @xmath6 .        </S>",
    "<S> _ discussion.- _ to further establish the generality of our results we explore a broader range of soft glassy materials in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.3 ] . for three different concentrations , thixotropic laponite suspensions [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.3](a ) ] and carbon black gels [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.3](b ) ] display a bell - shaped @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the case of a concentrated emulsion [ commercial mayonnaise , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.3](c ) ] seems intermediate between carbopol and the two previous materials : the loop area @xmath5 exhibits a maximum at the faster end of the accessible range of sweep rates corresponding to @xmath45  s i.e. @xmath46  s. these bell - shaped curves are well captured by lognormal fits , leading to the master curve shown in fig  [ fig.3](d ) .    the above results hint at a unified picture in which the behaviors of both @xmath5 and @xmath6 are interpreted in terms of a single characteristic timescale @xmath47 . for @xmath48 , </S>",
    "<S> the bulk material remains fluidized during the downward sweep while flow heterogeneity during the upward sweep keeps increasing with @xmath29 [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.1](a , b ) ] , leading to increasing @xmath6 and @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath6 displays a sharper increase than @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the lower sensitivity of @xmath5 may be attributed to microstructural changes in the _ fluidized _ suspension ( e.g. local fluctuations in the concentration or in the size of colloidal aggregates ) responsible for differences in viscosity only , so that downward and upward flow curves may not superimpose ( @xmath49 ) although velocity profiles are all linear ( @xmath50 ) . making a rigorous connection between @xmath5 and @xmath6 from theoretical approaches and/or material - dependent </S>",
    "<S> modeling is a challenging task that must be addressed in the future together with time - resolved structural characterization during the sweeps .    as for the maximum of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , </S>",
    "<S> velocity data show that @xmath7 corresponds to the point where flow heterogeneity first appears during the downward sweep . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath51 can thus be interpreted as the sweep rate for which restructuration balances shear - induced fluidization over the cycle . for @xmath52 </S>",
    "<S> the decrease of @xmath5 is easily explained if one notices that the shear stress becomes independent of the sweep direction as soon as fully arrested states are reached [ figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.1](c ) and [ fig.2](a , b ) ] . whatever the material , arrested states span over larger portions of the flow curve as @xmath29 is increased at the expense of transient shear - banded flows . </S>",
    "<S> this tends to decrease the low shear rate contribution to the loop area , hence the decreasing behavior of @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the slower the sweep rate , the closer the flow gets to its steady state , and thus the smaller the areas @xmath5 and @xmath6 as expected from first intuition @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that wall slip , i.e. the presence of lubricating layers at the boundaries , does not seem to bring any significant contribution to @xmath5 and @xmath6 . indeed using roughened walls does not affect the shape of the areas nor the value of @xmath7 ( see supplementary figure  2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> total slippage thus appears as a mere consequence of flow arrest in the bulk and the nonmonotonic behavior of @xmath5 and @xmath6 originates only from the bulk flow heterogeneity . </S>",
    "<S> still potential effects of the flow geometry on the shape of the hysteresis loops and/or on @xmath7 should be investigated . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , in both carbopol microgels and laponite suspensions , inhomogeneous shear - banded flows are observed concomitantly with sections of the upward flow curves where @xmath2 presents a plateau [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.1](b ) ] or decreases with increasing @xmath33 [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.1](c ) and [ fig.2](a , b ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> this is in agreement with a universal criterion proposed recently in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite which predicts transient shear banding to arise just after any stress overshoot during startup .    </S>",
    "<S> finally fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.3 ] suggests that the characteristic time @xmath7 continuously grows when going from simple yield stress fluids ( carbopol , emulsions ) to highly time - dependent materials ( laponite , carbon black ) . in carbopol microgels @xmath7 </S>",
    "<S> is too short to be measured and only the decreasing parts of @xmath5 and @xmath6 are observed . for thixotropic materials @xmath7 </S>",
    "<S> could be linked to the history - dependent timescales for structure breakdown and build - up inferred from shear rate jumps @xcite . however , here , @xmath7 is protocol - independent as long as @xmath13 and @xmath14 are well separated . </S>",
    "<S> we may therefore speculate that it relates to the intrinsic material `` restructuring time '' invoked in recent theoretical arguments and numerical simulations @xcite , e.g. , the ( very short ) duration of rearrangement events in simple yield stress fluids ( known as t1 events in emulsions and foams @xcite ) and the ( much longer ) aggregation time of colloidal particles in other systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the observed decrease of @xmath7 with laponite concentration would thus result from faster aggregation dynamics while the inverse trend in carbon black gels could be attributed to sedimentation of large clusters which gets slower as the concentration is increased .    to conclude our study provides experimentalists with observables that quantify the distance to steady state in measurements of the constitutive relation : whatever the soft glassy system , sweep rates much larger than @xmath51 should be used to ensure that effects of long - lived transients and inhomogeneous shear - banded or arrested flows are minimized . </S>",
    "<S> exploring the hysteresis maximum through faster sweeps provides interesting physical insights on how local flow properties drive rheological hysteresis and on the type of material , with an apparently continuous transition from strong thixotropy ( large @xmath7 ) to simple yield stress fluids ( vanishingly small @xmath7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , spatially - resolved models are needed to further explain and complete our experimental findings . </S>",
    "<S> soft - glassy rheology approaches @xcite and local fluidity models @xcite appear as ideal candidates to check whether rheological hysteresis could be envisioned in a universal framework as suggested by the present work .    </S>",
