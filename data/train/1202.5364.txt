    "zno is a semiconductor with wide band - gap , and is stable in aqueous solution .",
    "one of the most remarkable applications of zno in photoelectrochemical ( pec ) field is that , it can be used to split water by solar light to produce hydrogen as clean fuel . besides , zno is also a promising candidate of photoanode material in pec cells @xcite . for most of wide - gap semiconductors such as zno and tio@xmath0 ,",
    "the band - gap is far beyond the threshold of 1.23 ev for the water splitting , even though the overpotential looses require a larger threshold energy about 1.7 ev @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the wide band - gap semiconductors can merely absorb the ultraviolet portion of the solar spectra . to enhance the efficiency of utilizing the solar energy ,",
    "a key issue is how to narrow the band - gap of semiconductors below 2.0 ev @xcite so that the majority of the visible light can be absorbed . to solve this issue , a suitable band edge positioning with respect to the potentials of reduction and oxidation reactions , together with the suppression of charge recombination centers ,",
    "should be considered @xcite .",
    "there has been a number of studies concerning the above considerations . among them , the donor - acceptor codoping in zno and tio@xmath0 materials is remarkable .",
    "recent theoretical calculations show that , it is possible to narrow the band - gap of zno bulk by codoping ( ga+n ) or ( al+n ) @xcite ; the band - gaps of tio@xmath0 bulk can be narrowed to be 2.26 ev , 1.6 ev and 0.9 ev for charge compensated codoping ( mo+c ) @xcite , noncompensated codoping ( cr+n ) and ( v+c ) @xcite , respectively .",
    "experimentally , doping cu @xcite and codoping ( ga+cu ) @xcite in p - type , codoping ( ga+n ) @xcite or ( al+n ) @xcite in n - type zno films have been realized . in their optical absorption spectra , there is a long tail from the absorption peak in the ultraviolet range that persists in the central visible range , thereby narrowing the band - gap . the key factors to enhance the pec responses by codoping ga and n in zno films are believed to include either producing an excellent crystallinity , or to narrow the band - gap , or to generate a wide depletion layer to suppress the recombination rate @xcite .",
    "it is also observed that n doped n - type zno nanowires ( znonws ) @xcite can enhance pec responses that are similar to those in codoped zno films .",
    "a theoretical study on the o - vacancy in znonws suggests that the neutral and charged states of defects have crucial contributions to optical absorption in the visible range @xcite .",
    "the charged states of o - vacancy in tio@xmath0 bulks have also been emphasized @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we shall explore the structural and optical properties of uncompensated n , p and ga codoped znonws by means of the first - principles calculations within the density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite .",
    "we have found that the low negative charged states of n - related defects play a key role in producing the long tail of the optical absorption spectrum , which narrow the band - gap and enhance the pec response significantly .",
    "it is also observed that the uncompensated n , p and ga codoping can generate a red - shift of the optical absorption spectra larger than the exclusive n doping , and a proper formation energy with a high defect concentration and a suppressed recombination rate can be acquired .",
    "these observations will be useful for the application of znonws in the pec field ( e.g. the water splitting ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we shall briefly introduce the calculational approach , including the generalized gradient approximation plus u ( gga+u ) correction , and the extrapolation method to correct the band - gaps . in sec .",
    "iii , the negative charged states and optical absorption spectra of n - doped znonws will be explored . in sec .",
    "iv , the defect bands and uncompensated n , p and ga codoping in znonws to enhance the pec response will be discussed .",
    "an extrapolation method is applied to discuss the relevant experimental observations .",
    "finally , a summary is given .",
    "the calculations are performed using the dft based vasp code @xcite , which employs the pseudopotentials of the projector augmented wave ( paw ) @xcite , with the gga in the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) form @xcite for exchange correlations .",
    "the cutoff energy for the plane - wave basis set is 400 ev .",
    "the convergence criteria for dft calculations are 10@xmath1 ev of total energy and 10@xmath2 ev /  of force .",
    "all structural relaxations and formation energies are calculated with spin polarization , with the morkhorst - pack k - points meshes of @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 for zno bulk , zno film and znonw , respectively . after a full relaxation ,",
    "the density of states ( dos ) and the optical absorption spectra of znonw are calculated without spin polarization , and the k - points mesh is raised to @xmath6 .    to obtain the absorption spectra , the frequency dependent dielectric matrices are calculated by vasp after structural relaxation .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric tensor are obtained by the usual kramers - kronig transformation and a summation over empty states , respectively @xcite , from which the energy dependent dielectric function along the axial direction of the nanowires and thus the imaginary part of refractive index can be obtained .",
    "the optical absorption intensity is proportional to the imaginary part of refractive index .",
    "it is known that the conventional dft method always underestimates the band - gap of semiconductors , and the position of the charged states of the defects with respect to the valence band edge also tends to be underestimated .",
    "the character of the defect bands is a mixture of the valence and conduction bands , which can be reflected by the change of the defect bands from gga to gga+u calculations @xcite .",
    "note that in the following , figs . 2 - 6",
    "are calculated by gga without u correction , while for fig .",
    "7 , the gga+u method @xcite implemented in vasp code is employed to calculate the optical absorption spectra for several key cases .",
    "approach @xcite is adopted , where only the difference of the coulomb and exchange parameters @xmath7 is meaningful .    inspired by the extrapolation scheme in previous works about zno @xcite , based on the results from both gga and gga+u with a small value of @xmath7 for d electrons , we extrapolate the calculated band - gap of the ground state of n doped ultrathin znonw to the band - gap of the experimentally synthesized n doped znonw @xcite , and then estimate the band - gaps and the optical absorption peaks if other defects are doped in the same znonws in experiments .",
    "the extrapolation equation that is similar to the one given in ref .",
    "is as follows : @xmath8,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 represents substitutionally doping one n atom instead of o atom , and @xmath10 represents other defects .",
    "any band - gap @xmath11 corresponds to a peak in the optical absorption spectrum , no matter how it is obtained either from gga ( @xmath12 ) and gga+u ( @xmath13 ) , or from the experiment ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "besides the extrapolation method to correct the band - gap , it is instructive to note that by incorporating u not only for d electrons but also for s or p electrons , the effective corrections to the band - gaps and spectra have already been obtained in several cases @xcite . to aim at giving an approximate but intuitive view on the absorption spectra , we shall consider several situations for a comparison in the following [ as will be seen in figs .",
    "7(a ) and ( b ) ] , namely , u is incorporated for the d electrons of zn , p electrons of o @xcite , as well as the corresponding electrons of their substitutional dopants .    in a supercell",
    ", the formation energy @xmath15 of a charged defect @xmath10 with a net charge @xmath16 can be calculated through the following equation @xcite @xmath17where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the total energy with and without the defects , respectively , @xmath20 is the change of atomic number , @xmath21 is the reservoir chemical potentials , @xmath22zn , o , n , p , ga , and @xmath23 is the fermi level ( fl ) with respect to the valence band edge varying between zero and the band - gap @xmath11 .    for charged defects , a jellium background is used .",
    "however , we note that the periodic boundary conditions may induce spurious electrostatic interactions between charged unit cells , possibly leaving errors in energy from the first - principles calculations @xcite . for an aperiodic three - dimensional condensed matter system , makov and",
    "payne evaluated the total energy by @xcite @xmath24where @xmath25 , @xmath16 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the desired electrostatic energy of the point defect in the dilute limit , the ionic charge of the defect , the madelung constant of the lattice , the linear dimension of the supercell , the dielectric constant , and the quadrupole moment independent of @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath30 term is the madelung energy for the lattice of point charges in the jellium background , and for quasi one - dimensional system such as nanowires , @xmath27 corresponds to the periodicity of the nanowire @xcite .",
    "the @xmath31 term exists with a quadrupole moment and is inversely proportional to the supercell volume @xcite .",
    "if the vacuum separation between the nanowires is fixed and only the axial length @xmath32 of supercell changes , the supercell volume is proportional to @xmath32 .",
    "more methods to correct the formation energy have been demonstrated @xcite for several cases of nanowires .    in the present work , to evaluate the effect of the energy errors on the structural stability , we model the energy correction term similar to the form of madelung energy .",
    "the total energy is expressed as @xmath33where @xmath34 is the parameter and is zero for neutral charged nanowires , and @xmath32 is the axial length of the supercell .",
    "then , eq . ( 2 ) is corrected to be @xmath35@xmath36@xmath37 is the desired energy of the defect in the dilute limit . for a given charged defect @xmath38 with given @xmath21 and @xmath23 , @xmath37 and the parameter @xmath34 of the defect",

    "thus , the error of the defect formation energy @xmath39(@xmath38,@xmath32 ) can be evaluated by @xmath40 the supercells of zno bulk , zno film and znonw contain 128 , 144 , 96 atoms in total , respectively .",

    "the central three layers are fixed to the bulk positions while the top and bottom three layers are allowed to relax without constraints .",
    "the supercell of znonw contains two periodic units along the [ 0001 ] direction with diameter of 9.9  , and the axial length of the supercell is 10.84  .",
    "the vacuum distances between the surfaces of neighboring zno film and znonw are kept 9.7 and 15.1  , respectively .",
    "the size of the supercell of znonw is @xmath42  .",
