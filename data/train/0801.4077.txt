    "transition metal oxides attract a lot of attention due to a great variety of physical phenomena , most of which go along with the ordering of some microscopic degrees of freedom as a function of , e.g. , temperature , pressure , or doping .",
    "prominent examples are the striking metal - insulator transitions of the vanadates @xcite , high-@xmath4 superconductivity in the cuprates , or the colossal magnetoresistance observed in the manganates @xcite .",
    "cobaltates have aroused much interest due to the occurrence of different spin states @xcite .",
    "in addition , they are promising materials for thermoelectric applications @xcite .    known since 1873 , when friedel discovered the mineral @xmath5 , the delafossites @xmath6 keep on generating a strong and ever increasing interest @xcite , especially after kawazoe _ et al .",
    "_  evidenced simultaneous transparency and p - type conductivity @xcite , which laid ground for the development of transparent optoelectronic devices .",
    "furthermore , the quasi two - dimensionality of the lattice and the triangular coordination of atoms gave rise to such exciting physical properties as strong anisotropies of the electrical conductivity and magnetic frustration effects .",
    "the delafossite structure has the space group @xmath7 and results from a stacking of monoatomic triangular layers , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] @xcite .    .",
    "palladium , cobalt , and oxygen atoms are shown as green , blue , and red ( light , big dark , and small dark ) spheres , respectively . ]    in particular , the b - atoms are at the centers of distorted oxygen octahedra , which share edges and form the characteristic @xmath8 sandwich layers . these trilayers are interlinked by linear o  a  o bonds , resulting in a twofold coordination of the a - atoms",
    ". however , the latter have , in addition , six in - plane nearest neighbour a - atoms .",
    "for this reason , the structure may be likewise regarded as formed from single a - atom layers , which are intertwined by the octahedral sandwiches . for @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    ", we will find this latter point of view particularly useful .",
    "finally , the oxygen atoms are tetrahedrally coordinated by one a - atom and three b - atoms .",
    "pressure studies reveal an increase of the structural anisotropy on compression indicating the high mechanical stability of both the octahedral sandwich layers and the o  pd ",
    "o ( o  pt  o ) dumbbells @xcite .    in general , interest in the delafossite - type compounds has concentrated quite much on the triangular arrangement of the transition - metal atoms and the resulting possible frustration effects , which arise once localized magnetic moments are established . while most of these oxides have been found to be antiferromagnetic semiconductors , other class members like @xmath9 , @xmath0 , @xmath10 , and @xmath1 attracted interest due to their rather high metallic conductivity .",
    "in particular , @xmath0 has been shown to possess one of the lowest electric resistivities of normal - state oxides , even lower than that of pd metal at room temperature @xcite . yet , the conductivity is strongly anisotropic @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the ratio of the resistivities parallel and perpendicular to the @xmath11 axis can be as large as @xmath12 in @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "photoemission data indicate that the density of states at the fermi energy can be exclusively attributed to the pd @xmath13 states @xcite . from the combination of photoemission spectroscopy and inverse photoemission spectroscopy several authors",
    "concluded that the fermi energy is located at a shallow minimum of the density of states and doping might thus lead to rather high values of the thermoelectric power @xcite .    despite their simple chemical formulae the delafossites may be regarded as prototypical superlattices where the composition of both the a and b layers can be used to strongly influence the behavior of the whole system . for instance , in @xmath14 , the fermi energy falls into the cr @xmath15 band , but since the cr layers order magnetically this compound is a magnetic semiconductor . in contrast ,",
    "as will be shown below , in @xmath0 , the co layers only act a charge reservoirs , and conduction takes place almost exclusively in the pd layers .    as a matter of fact , quite",
    "a few electronic structure calculations for delafossite compounds have been reported in the literature @xcite . for @xmath0 , there exist linear muffin - tin orbitals calculations by seshadri _",
    "et al . _  as well as by okabe _ et al . _",
    "@xcite . while according to the former authors , who also investigated @xmath1 , the density of states at @xmath16 is mainly due to the pd @xmath13 states with only small contributions from the co @xmath15 and o @xmath17 orbitals , the results by okabe _",
    "_  are not very specific in this respect . for this reason ,",
    "the role of these orbitals for the metallic conductivity is not yet completely clear . in order to resolve the issue and to make closer connection with the photoemission data , we apply in the present work the new full - potential augmented spherical wave method to study the electronic properties of the title compounds .",
    "we concentrate especially on the strong anisotropies and on the influence of the different species and orbitals on the electronic properties .",
    "the calculations are based on density - functional theory and the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite with the local - density approximation parametrized according to perdew and wang @xcite .",
    "they were performed using the scalar - relativistic implementation of the augmented spherical wave ( asw ) method ( see refs .   and references therein ) .",
    "in the asw method , the wave function is expanded in atom - centered augmented spherical waves , which are hankel functions and numerical solutions of schrdinger s equation , respectively , outside and inside the so - called augmentation spheres . in order to optimize the basis set",
    ", additional augmented spherical waves were placed at carefully selected interstitial sites .",
    "the choice of these sites as well as the augmentation radii were automatically determined using the sphere - geometry optimization algorithm @xcite .",
    "self - consistency was achieved by a highly efficient algorithm for convergence acceleration @xcite .",
    "the brillouin zone integrations were performed using the linear tetrahedron method with up to 1469 * k*-points within the irreducible wedge @xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we used a new full - potential version of the asw method , which was implemented only very recently @xcite . in this version ,",
    "the electron density and related quantities are given by a spherical - harmonics expansion inside the muffin - tin spheres .",
    "in the remaining interstitial region , a representation in terms of atom - centered hankel functions is used @xcite . however , in contrast to previous related implementations , we here get away without needing a so - called multiple-@xmath18 basis set , which fact allows for a very high computational speed of the resulting scheme .",
    "while the previous calculations were based on the crystal structure data by prewitt _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , we here calculated these parameters from a minimization of the total energy . to this end , in a first step for each compound the lattice was relaxed and after that the oxygen parameter was optimized .",

[ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab1 ]    note that the deviation of the calculated structural parameters from the measured ones is 2.4% at most , which is very well within the known limits of the gga and an excellent proof of the validity of the new full - potential asw method .    in order to discuss the electronic properties , we first concentrate on @xmath0 and only after that discuss the changes coming with the substitution of pt for pd .",

    "the rather complicated structure of both the electronic bands and the dos results from the energetical overlap of the relevant orbitals in the energy interval shown . while the lower part of the spectrum is dominated by o @xmath17 states , the transition metal @xmath2 states",
    "lead to rather sharp peaks in the interval from @xmath19ev to @xmath20ev . in particular , we recognize the @xmath21 and @xmath22 manifolds of the co @xmath15 states as resulting from the octahedral coordination . in representing these partial dos",
    "we have used a local rotated coordinate system with the cartesian axes pointing towards the oxygen atoms .",
    "@xmath23-type overlap of the o @xmath17 states with the co @xmath15 @xmath22 orbitals leads to the rather sharp contribution of the latter near @xmath24ev .",
    "in contrast , due to the much weaker @xmath25-type overlap of the o @xmath17 states with the @xmath21 orbitals , these states give rise to sharp peaks in the interval from @xmath26ev to @xmath16 .",
    "since the fermi energy falls right between the @xmath21 and @xmath22 manifolds , co turns out to be in a @xmath27 low - spin state .",
    "our results thus provide further support to the picture that co is trivalent while pd is in a monovalent @xmath28 configuration @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the co and o states give only a tiny contribution to the electrical conductivity , which is maintained almost exclusively by the pd @xmath13 states .",
    "the latter are further analyzed in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ,     dos of @xmath0 . ]    which displays the five pd @xmath13 partial dos . since pd",
    "is linearly coordinated by two oxygen atoms parallel to the @xmath11 axis and has six pd neighbours in the @xmath29-@xmath30 plane we used the global coordinate system to represent these partial dos . with this choice , contributions from the @xmath31 and @xmath32 as well as from the @xmath33 and",
    "@xmath34 states are identical . the pd @xmath13 partial dos are strongly influenced by the aforementioned coordination .",
    "in particular , the six peaks of the @xmath35 states near @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41ev are complemented by contributions of the o @xmath17 partial dos of similar shape reflecting the strong @xmath23-type @xmath2-@xmath42 overlap along the @xmath11 axis . in contrast , the short in - plane pd - pd distances of about 2.83   ( experimental value ) , which are only by 3% longer than those in metallic pd , lead to the broad pd @xmath43 bands visible in the interval from @xmath44 to @xmath45ev in fig .",
    "in addition , these bands give rise to the largest contribution at @xmath16 , whereas the @xmath46 states do not contribute at all .",
    "in contrast , the contribution from the @xmath35 orbitals is rather similar to that of the @xmath43 orbitals .",
    "however , according to a @xmath47-resolved analysis , their weights vary on the fermi surface . at about @xmath48ev , the contribution of the @xmath43 orbitals is strongly suppressed , and the small dispersion along the line m - k causes the sharp @xmath35 peak seen in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .",
    "the strong quasi two - dimensionality of the electronic states is reflected by the fermi surface depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] .    .",
    "]    apart from the very small bending parallel to the @xmath11 direction , it gives rise to completely in - plane fermi velocities and explains the strong anisotropy in electric conductivity .",
    "however , note that , according to the electronic bands shown in fig .  [ fig3 ] , the dispersion parallel to the direction @xmath49-a in general is not negligible . in passing ,",
    "we mention the negligible dispersion along m - k , which is typical of tight - binding bands in a triangular lattice .",
    "these bands give rise to the sharp peak at about @xmath39ev in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] and can thus be attributed to the pd @xmath35 states .",
    "overall , our results are in good agreement with the previous calculations by seshadri _",

    "_ et al . _",
    "in particular , seshadri _",
    "et al . _",
    "obtained a distribution of states at @xmath16 , which is similar to ours .",

    "_  and higuchi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who attribute the metallic conductivity almost exclusively to the pd @xmath13 states .",
    "it has been argued by several authors , that the dominant contribution is due to the pd @xmath35 orbitals , which hybridize with the pd @xmath50 states .",
    "while we find indeed a @xmath50 contribution of the order of @xmath51states / ev , hence , of the order of 10% of the @xmath35 partial dos at @xmath16 , we still point to the in - plane @xmath31 and @xmath32 states , which play an even greater role at @xmath16 than the @xmath35 states . as a consequence ,",
    "our results demonstrate that the metallic conductivity is maintained by the in - plane @xmath31 and @xmath32 orbitals and the in - plane part of the @xmath35 orbitals to a similar degree with a somewhat greater influence of the former .",

    "resemble those of the palladium system .",
    "however , the larger extent of the pt @xmath52 orbitals as compared to the pd @xmath13 states leads to an increased width mainly of the in - plane @xmath2 bands as well as an increased overlap of these states with the o @xmath17 states . as a consequence",
    ", the anisotropy of the electrical conductivity will be somewhat reduced in @xmath1 as is indeed observed @xcite .    in passing ,",
    "we mention additional gga+u calculations for @xmath0 , which however , confirmed the gga results without any noticeable changes .",
    "in summary , we have shown that the strongly anisotropic metallic conductivity of @xmath0 and @xmath1 is almost exclusively due to the pd ( pt ) layers .",
    "in contrast , the octahedrally coordinated @xmath3 sandwiches are insulating .",
    "as co was found in a low - spin @xmath27 configuration , these @xmath3 complexes strongly suppress the electronic coupling between the pd ( pt ) metallic layers , and the @xmath53 layers merely act as charge reservoirs . in addition , they pronounce the quasi two - dimensionality of the system . it may be speculated how the introduction of impurities into the cobalt layers , i.e.  replacing , e.g.  fe or ni for co , alters the electronic properties locally and might thus be used to design nano - structured materials .",
    "work along this line is in progress . in this context",
    "one might ask to what extent the structural changes induced by the introduction of impurities with different covalent radii as compared to co might be damped by the intermediate oxygen layers .",
    "this would provide a situation , where chemical substitution only acts on the electronic degrees of freedom .",
