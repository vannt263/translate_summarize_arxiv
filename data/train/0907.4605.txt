    "it is obtained by taking sum of inductions of certain one dimensional representations of involution centralizers , hence called _",
    "involution model_. it is easy to see that , for a finite group @xmath0 , the dimension of an involution model for @xmath0 is equal to the dimension of a gelfand model for @xmath0 ( i.e. , the sum of dimensions of all irreducible representations of @xmath0 ) if and only if every irreducible complex linear representation of @xmath0 can be realized over @xmath6 . therefore ,",
    "if a group @xmath0 has a non - real irreducible representation then any involution model for @xmath0 is never a gelfand model .",

    "araujo and others ( @xcite ) proved that the polynomial models associated to the canonical representations of the weyl groups @xmath4 and @xmath5 are gelfand models .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study polynomial models for all finite coxeter groups , irreducible or not , associated to their canonical faithful representations . in theorem",
    "[ thm:2 ] , we give another description of the polynomial model @xmath7 associated to a faithful representation @xmath1 of a finite group @xmath0 .",
    "our description is easier to work with and gives much more information than the original description in @xcite .",
    "for instance , it is quite clear from theorem [ thm:2 ] that an irreducible representation of @xmath0 is always contained in any polynomial model .",
    "thus , @xmath7 is a gelfand model for @xmath0 if and only if the multiplicity of each irreducible representation of @xmath0 in @xmath7 is one .",
    "the question now is to compute the multiplicity of an irreducible representation of @xmath0 in its polynomial model @xmath7 . if @xmath0 is a finite coxeter group , then this question is related to the study of the fake degree of an irreducible representation of @xmath0 . in section 3 ,",
    "we recall some well - known facts about finite coxeter groups and the fake degrees .",
    "section 4 is devoted to proving the following main result .",
    "_ let @xmath0 be a finite coxeter group and let @xmath1 be its canonical faithful representation .",

    "_      every irreducible representation of a finite group @xmath0 is contained in any polynomial model for @xmath0 ( see theorem [ thm:2 ] ) .",

    "as discussed above , the dimension of an involution model for a finite coxeter group @xmath0 is always equal to the dimension of a gelfand model for @xmath0 . therefore , an involution model is a gelfand model for a finite coxeter group @xmath0 if and only if it contains each of its irreducible representations .",
    "thus , in the case of finite coxeter groups , involution models and polynomials models have complementary properties and it would be interesting to study the interplay between these two models .",
    "we hope to take up this study in a subsequent paper .",
    "we also believe that our description of the polynomial model in theorem [ thm:2 ] can be used to describe gelfand models for finite groups which are not coxeter groups .",
    "a trivial example is that the polynomial model for a finite cyclic group @xmath0 associated to any of its one dimensional faithful representations is a gelfand model for @xmath0 .",

    "<S> a gelfand model for a finite group @xmath0 is a complex linear representation of @xmath0 that contains each of its irreducible representations with multiplicity one . for a finite group @xmath0 with a faithful representation @xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> one constructs a representation which we call the polynomial model for @xmath0 associated to @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> araujo and others have proved that the polynomial models for certain irreducible weyl groups associated to their canonical representations are gelfand models .    in this paper , we give an easier and uniform treatment for the study of the polynomial model for a general finite coxeter group associated to its canonical representation . </S>",
    "<S> our final result is that such a polynomial model for a finite coxeter group @xmath0 is a gelfand model if and only if @xmath0 has no direct factor of the type @xmath2 or @xmath3 . </S>"
