    "symmetry plays an important role in quantum mechanics.@xcite it helps predict and classify wavefunctions a quantum system can have in each energy level . for three - dimensional rotational invariant potentials such as in a harmonic oscillator and a hydrogen atom , their schrdinger s equations , @xmath0 can be solved analytically and there exist explicit formulas which relate a number of wavefunctions or degeneracy to energy level @xmath1 . for other symmetric , geometrical potentials , analytical method may not be able to find their solutions . except by guessing from symmetry of the potentials ,",
    "one hardly knows their approximate solutions .",
    "however , with the inclusion of computational tools , their numerical solutions including their degeneracies can be seen explicitly .    as it is realized that simulation is one of the paths toward scientific truth.@xcite in this note , programs in octopus code@xcite are demonstrated to generate electron energy levels in three - dimensional geometric potential wells .",
    "although octopus package is designed to solve many - body systems based on time - dependent density functional theory , it is able to solve single - particle systems based on the schrdinger s equation and to produce output files for potentials and wavefunctions , which can be viewed by visualizers such as gnuplot , opendx , etc .",
    "the potential wells are modeled to have shapes similar to cone , pyramid and truncated - pyramid.@xcite to simulate the electron energy levels in quantum mechanical scheme like the ones in parabolic band approximation scheme , the programs are run initially to find ground - state energies in the wells as close to those in quantum dots as possible and further to simulate excited - state energies .",
    "the programs also produce wavefunctions , which are visualized by opendx , for exploring and determining their degeneracies and vibrational normal modes .",
