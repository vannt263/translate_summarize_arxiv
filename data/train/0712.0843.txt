    "the title of this article is in reference to a recent work by jouffrey _",
    "et al_.  @xcite with the title  the magic angle : a solved mystery . \"",
    "the _ magic angle _ in electron energy loss spectroscopy ( eels ) is a special value of the microscope collection - angle @xmath3 at which the measured spectrum  magically \" becomes independent of the angle between the incoming beam and the sample  @xmath4-axis . \"",
    "the mystery , in the context of 200 kev electron microscopy , is that standard semi - relativistic quantum theory yields a ratio of the magic angle @xmath5 to  characteristic angle \" @xmath6 of more than twice the observed  @xcite value .",
    "unfortunately , time  @xcite and again,@xcite the theoretical justification of the factor of two turned out to be an errant factor of two elsewhere in the calculation . a key contribution of jouffrey _",
    "et al_.  was the observation that relativistic  transverse \" effects , when properly included in the theory , naturally give a factor of two correction to the non - relativistic magic angle . here",
    "we show that there are yet additional corrections to the theory which can even break the sample independence of the magic angle .    as in ref .",
    "[ ] , we consider here the problem of a relativistic probe electron scattering off of a macroscopic condensed matter sample .",
    "similar problems have been solved long ago using both semi - classical  @xcite and fully quantum - mechanical approachs.@xcite indeed , the fully quantum - mechanical , relativistic case of scattering two plane - wave electrons has long been a textbook problem.@xcite this classic problem was revived recently in the works of jouffrey _",
    "et al_.  @xcite and of schattschneider _ et al_.,@xcite in which a  flaw \" in the standard theory is pointed out .",
    "the flaw is the approximation that the so - called  longitudinal \" and  transverse \" matrix elements for the scattering process may be summed incoherently , as argued by fano in a seminal paper.@xcite in fact , this approximation is only valid when the sample under consideration posseses certain symmetries . in a later review article,@xcite fano states",
    "this condition explicitly ; namely that his original formula for the cross - section is only applicable to systems of cubic symmetry .",
    "however , this caveat , seems to have been generally ignored , and hence turns out to be the source of the magic angle ",
    "mystery\".@xcite jouffrey _",
    "et al . _ , and later schattschneider _ et al_. ,  showed that if one correctly sums and squares the transition matrix elements then , in the dipole approximation , one finds the magic angle corrected by a factor of two .",
    "our aim here is to examine the theory in more detail in order to derive both relativistic and material - dependent corrections to the magic angle . in section",
    "ii we consider relativistic electron scattering within the formalism of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",
    "working the coulomb gauge , we show that one can almost reproduce the results of jouffrey _",
    "et al_.  and the theory of schattschneider _",
    "et al_. , apart from a simple correction term of order @xmath7 , which is not always negligible .",
    "here @xmath8 is the energy lost by the probe and @xmath9 is the rest energy of an electron . in section iii",
    "we suggest the possibility of incorporating macroscopic electrodynamic effects into the theory , which can break the symmetry of sample independence of the magic angle .",
    "an appealing aspect of the formalism of schattschneider _",
    "et al_.  is its simplicity .",
    "their approach is similar to the semi - classical approach of mller,@xcite but with the added simplification of working with a probe and sample described by the schrdinger equation , rather than the dirac equation .",
    "they also find that the theory is simplified by choosing to work in the lorentz gauge .",
    "unfortunately , however , the theory of mller is somewhat _ ad hoc _ in that a classical calculation in the lorentz gauge is modified by replacing the product of two classical charge densities by the product of four different wavefunctions in order to obtain the transition matrix element .",
    "for the mller case this procedure is justified _ a posteriori _ by the fact that it reproduces the correct result , but is only rigorously justified by appealing to the method of second quantization.@xcite mller s proceedure is physically reasonable _ a priori _ , because mller was interested in the scattering of electrons in vacuum . however , the theory of schattschneider _ et al . , _  which largely mimics mller s theory , is less physically reasonable _ a priori _ , since the electrons are not scattering in vacuum , but are inside a solid which can screen the electrons . nevertheless , since the discrepancy is small , the schattschneider _",
    ", _ theory is justified _ a posteriori _ to a lesser extent by experiment.@xcite we thus refer to the theory of schattschneider et _",
    "al_. as a  vacuum - relativisitic theory .",
    "\" consequently , in an effort to account for the discrepancy with experiment , we feel that it is useful to rederive the results of jouffrey _",
    "et al_.  from a more fundamental starting point .",
    "it is easy to see that the theory of schattschneider _",
    "et al_.  is not formally exact , though for many materials the error in the vacuum relativistic limit is negligible . in fact , the discrepancy can be easily explained via single - particle quantum mechanics : although schattschneider _",
    "et al_.  work explicitly in the lorentz gauge , they also make the assumption that the momentum and the vector potential commute , @xmath10 of course , this commutation relation is only exact in the coulomb gauge . in the end , however , the error in this approximation only effects the final results ( e.g. , matrix elements ) by a correction of order @xmath11 compared to unity , where @xmath8 is the energy lost by the probe . since @xmath11 is at most @xmath0 for deep - core energy loss ,",
    "the effect is usually negligible , except of course , for very heavy atoms . to see how corrections such as the above enter into the theory , and further to determine whether or not such corrections are meaningful or simply artifacts of the various approximations used in the theory of schattschneider et _ al_.",
    ", we find it useful to present a fully quantum - mechanical , relativistic many - body treatment along the lines of fano,@xcite but without any assumption of symmetry of the sample .",
    "our treatment is at least as general as that of schattschneider _",
    "et al_.  as far as the symmetry of the sample is concerned . thus going beyond the formulations of schattschneider _",
    "et al_.  and mller , we take as our starting point the many - particle qed hamiltonian .",
    "we then show that in a single - particle approximation the theory yields the result of schattschneider _",
    "et al_.  together with the correction mentioned above .",
    "our starting point therefore is the hamiltonian in coulomb gauge  @xcite @xmath12 where the hamiltonian has been split into three parts : i ) the unperturbed electron part @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the second - quantized dirac field , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the usual dirac matrices , @xmath17 is the electron mass , and @xmath4 is the speed of light ;    \\ii ) the unperturbed ( transverse ) radiation part @xmath18 where @xmath19 destroys a photon of momentum @xmath20 , polarization @xmath21 , and energy @xmath22 ; and    \\iii ) the interaction part @xmath23 where @xmath24 @xmath25 is the charge of the proton , and @xmath26 is the system volume .",
    "let us next specialize to the case of a fixed number ( @xmath27 ) of electrons where the ( @xmath27)-th electron is singled out as the  fast probe \" traveling with velocity @xmath28 , and the remaining @xmath29 electrons make up the sample .",
    "we also introduce a lattice or cluster of ion - cores ( below we consider only elemental solids of atomic number @xmath1 but the generalization to more complex systems is obvious ) which is treated classically , and which gives rise to a potential @xmath30 as seen by the electrons . in this case",
    "our hamiltonian becomes : @xmath31 + v_{\\textrm{e - core}}({\\bm r } ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left [ c{\\bm \\alpha^{(i)}}\\cdot({\\bm p^{(i)}}+\\frac{e}{c}{\\bm a}({\\bm r^{(i ) } } ) ) + { \\bm \\beta^{(i ) } } mc^2 \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & + & e^2\\sum_{i=1}^n\\frac{1}{|{\\bm r}-{\\bm r^{(i)}}| } + \\frac{e^2}{2}\\sum_{1=i\\neq j=1}^n\\frac{1}{|{\\bm r^{(i)}}-{\\bm r^{(j)}}| } \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\sum_{i=1}^n v_{\\textrm{e - core}}({\\bm r^{(i ) } } ) + v_{\\textrm{core - core}}+h_{\\textrm{rad}}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the coordinates which are not labelled by an index refer to the probe electron .",
    "the interaction @xmath32 between ion cores is a constant and is henceforth dropped . to proceed to a single - particle approximation for the sample",
    ", the interaction of the sample electrons among themselves and with the potential of the ion cores may be taken into account by introducing a single - particle self - consistent potential @xmath33 which includes both @xmath34 and exchange - correlation effects .",
    "the interaction of the probe electron with the effective single electron of the sample will be considered explicitly .",
    "the difference between this interaction and the actual interaction between the probe and sample can be accounted for by introducing another potential @xmath35 which is not necessarily the same as @xmath33 ; @xmath35 is , in theory ,  closer \" to the pure @xmath34 potential than @xmath33 though , in practice , this difference may not be of interest ( see the appendix for further explanation of this point ) .",
    "the potential @xmath35 leads to diffraction of the probe electron , which will not be considered in this paper in order to make contact with the theory of schattschneider _",
    "et al_.  it is also for this reason that we have introduced a single - particle picture of the sample , along with the fact that we want to apply this theory to real condensed matter systems in a practical way . the extension to the many - body case , in which the only single - body potential seen by the probe is due to the ion - cores , is given in the appendix .",
    "thus using the single - particle approximation for the sample , @xmath36+{\\bm \\beta } mc^2 \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\left [ c{\\bm \\alpha_s}\\cdot[{\\bm p_s}+\\frac{e}{c}{\\bm a}({\\bm r_s } ) ] + { \\bm \\beta_s } mc^2 \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & + & v'({\\bm r } ) + e^2\\frac{1}{|{\\bm r}-{\\bm r_s}| } + v({\\bm r_s } ) + h_{\\rm rad},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the quantities labeled by the letter @xmath37 refer to the sample electron and the unlabeled quantites refer to the probe electron . in the remainder of this paper we set @xmath38 , though the generalization of the theory to include diffraction is not expected to be difficult .",
    "as it turns out,@xcite we may start from an effective schrdinger treatment of both the sample _ and the probe _ rather than a dirac treatment .",
    "the treatment of the probe by a ",
    "relativistically corrected \" schrdinger equation is standard practice  @xcite in much of eels theory , and is appropriate  @xcite for modern microscope energies of interest here ( _ e.g. , _ a few hundred kev ) .",
    "the relativistic correction to the schrdinger equation of the probe consists in simply replacing the mass of the probe @xmath17 by the relativistic mass @xmath39 where @xmath40 . moreover working with a schrdinger equation treatment facilitates contact with the  vacuum - relativistic \" magic - angle theory of schattschneider _",
    "et al_. we will indicate later how the results change if we retain a full dirac treatment of the electrons .",
