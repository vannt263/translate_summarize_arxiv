    "in this paper we study how the propagation speed of interfaces in the allen - cahn phase field model for phase transformations in elastic solids depends on two parameters of the model .",
    "the model consists of the partial differential equations of linear elasticity coupled to the standard allen - cahn phase field equation .",
    "the two parameters , which we denote by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , control the interface energy and the interface width , but variation of these parameters also changes the interface speed , or more precisely , the form of the relation , which determines the interface speed as a function of the stress field and the curvature of the interface . in sharp interface models this relation is called kinetic relation .",
    "we use this notion also for phase field models .",
    "our goal is therefore to determine the kinetic relation for the allen - cahn model and the dependence of it on the two model parameters . to this end",
    "we must derive an asymptotic expansion for the propagation speed of the interface and prove an error estimate for this asymptotic expansion , which holds uniformly in both parameters .",
    "our results have consequences for the efficiency of the allen - cahn model in numerical simulations of interfaces with small interface energy .",
    "these consequences are also discussed .",
    "let @xmath2 be a bounded open set with a sufficiently smooth boundary @xmath3 .",
    "the points of @xmath4 represent the material points of a solid elastic body .",
    "the unknown functions in the model are the displacement @xmath5 of the material point @xmath6 at time @xmath7 , the cauchy stress tensor @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes the set of all symmetric @xmath10-matrices , and the order parameter @xmath11 .",
    "these unknowns must satisfy the model equations @xmath12 in the domain @xmath13 .",
    "the boundary and initial conditions are @xmath14 here @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 denote given data , the volume force , boundary displacement and initial data .",
    "@xmath18 denotes the derivative in direction of the unit normal vector @xmath19 to the boundary .",
    "the deformation gradient @xmath20 is the @xmath21matrix of first order partial derivatives of @xmath22 with respect to the components @xmath23 of @xmath6 , and the strain tensor @xmath24 is the symmetric part of the deformation gradient , where @xmath25 denotes the transpose matrix .",
    "the elasticity tensor @xmath26 is a linear symmetric , positive definite mapping , @xmath27 is a given constant matrix , the transformation strain , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are parameters .",
    "the elastic energy is given by @xmath30 with the matrix scalar product @xmath31 .",

    "this completes the formulation of the model .    and are the equations of linear elasticity theory .",
    "this subsystem is coupled to the allen - cahn equation , which governs the evolution of the order parameter @xmath37 .",
    "the system  satisfies the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "more precisely , the clausius - duhem inequality is satisfied with the free energy @xmath38 from this expression we see that the parameter @xmath39 determines the energy density of the phase interface .",
    "we assume that the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 vary in intervals @xmath40 $ ] and @xmath41 $ ] , respectively , with @xmath42 and @xmath43 chosen sufficiently small .",
    "the scaling @xmath44 on the right hand side of is necessary for otherwise the propagation speed of the diffuse interface would tend to zero for @xmath45 or @xmath46 .",
    "we give now a slightly sketchy overview of the main results in this article .",
    "the precise definitions and statements are given in section  [ s2 ] , and in particular in section  [ s2.4 ] .",
    "we denote solutions of the allen - cahn equation by @xmath47 , to distinguish them from aproximate solutions , which we construct later .",
    "the values @xmath48 or @xmath49 indicate that at the point @xmath50 at time @xmath7 the crystal structure of the material of the solid belongs to phase  1 or to phase  2 , respectively .",
    "the set of all @xmath50 with @xmath51 is the region of the diffuse interface at time @xmath7 .",
    "the level set @xmath52 belongs to this region .",
    "for @xmath53 we denote by @xmath54 the normal speed of this level set at @xmath6 , and we call @xmath55 the speed of the diffuse interface . for this speed",
    "we derive an expression of the form @xmath56 we call this expression the kinetic relation of the allen - cahn model . it is the central result of this paper .",
    "the remainder term @xmath57 depends on @xmath0 and @xmath1 , but in section  [ s6 ] we prove that there exist numbers @xmath42 and @xmath43 and a constant @xmath58 such that the @xmath59norm satisfies @xmath60 for all @xmath61 and all @xmath62 , where @xmath63 denotes the function @xmath64 .",

    "therefore @xmath7 can be considered to be a parameter in this problem .",
    "finally , the expression @xmath92 in equation denotes the mean value of the values @xmath93 and @xmath94 on both sides of the interface @xmath87 .",
    "the terms @xmath95 and @xmath96 are determined by a more complicated transmission problem , for which the transmission conditions are also posed on the interfae @xmath87 , and by a coupled system of ordinary differential equations for two functions @xmath97 and @xmath98 , which are needed in the construction of an asymptotic solution of the allen - cahn model  .",
    "the coefficients of the second transmission problem and of the system of ordinary differential equations depend on the solution @xmath99 of  . both transmission problems together",
    "can thus be considered to be a larger transmission problem , which is recursively solvable .",
    "the derivation of the kinetic relation is based on the construction of an asymptotic solution @xmath100 for the allen - cahn model . from this asymptotic solution",
    "it is seen that the width of the diffuse interface in the allen - cahn model is proportional to the parameter @xmath101 we call @xmath102 the interface width parameter . as will be explained in section  [ s2.4 ] ,",
    "the interface energy density is proportional to the parameter @xmath103 we call @xmath104 the interface energy parameter .",
    "the kinetic relation and the equation together have consequences for the efficiency of numerical simulations of interfaces with low interface energy density , which we sketch here .",
    "a precise discussion is given in section  [ s2.4 ] .",
    "the explicit expressions in show that the second term @xmath105 in is of a very special form .",
    "we therefore argue that this term does not have a physical meaning , only the leading term @xmath106 is physically relevant .",
    "this means that in the term @xmath107 small enough .",
    "therefore we call @xmath108 the model error and @xmath109 the error parameter . by , the interface width is proportional to the error parameter @xmath110 .",
    "this means that the interface width depends on the size of the model error .",
    "the smaller the model error is , which we want to allow , the smaller the interface width must be chosen . the total error in a numerical simulation",
    "consists of the model error and the numerical error . in order to make the numerical error small ,",
    "the grid spacing must be chosen small enough to resolve the transition of the order parameter from @xmath81 to @xmath82 across the diffuse interface .",
    "when the interface width is small , we must therefore choose the grid spacing small , which means that the numerical effort is high .",
    "from and we see that for constant values of the error parameter @xmath110 the interface width is proportional to the interface energy density parameter @xmath104 .",
    "thus , when we want to precisely simulate an interface with small interface energy density , we must choose small values for @xmath104 and @xmath110 , hence the interface width @xmath111 becomes very small . as a consequence , also the grid spacing must be chosen very small , which means that numerical simulations of interfaces with low interface energy based on the allen - cahn model are not efficient .",
    "of course , the efficiency can be improved by using adaptive mesh refinement and other advanced numerical techniques , but still it would be advantageous if such tools could be avoided .    often the allen - cahn model is formulated using the parameters @xmath104 and @xmath110 instead of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "it might therefore be helpful to shortly discuss the form , which our results take when this formulation is used . with these parameters",
    "the allen - cahn equation is @xmath112 the free energy becomes @xmath113 and the kinetic relation takes the form @xmath114 from this equation we see that the model error @xmath115 is governed by the ratio @xmath116 .",
    "when one reduces the interface energy density @xmath104 and one wants to keep the model error constant , one must reduce the interface width @xmath102 by the same proportion . in a simulation of an interface without interface energy ,",
    "the total model error is the sum @xmath117 . to reduce the error in such a simulation",
    "we must reduce @xmath104 and the fraction @xmath116 , hence @xmath102 must be reduced faster than @xmath104 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the main results are presented in section  [ s2 ] , where we first state the transmission problems and the system of ordinary differential equations , whose solutions are needed to compute the coefficients @xmath118 in .",
    "these coefficients are explicitly given in .",
    "moreover , in this theorem we also state properties of the asymptotic solution @xmath100 , which is constructed in later sections . in particular",
    ", we state the scaling law for the width of the diffuse interface .",
    "these properties are needed in section  [ s2.4 ] , where we precisely discuss the model error and the numerical efficiency .",
    "the estimate , which is the most important mathematical result of this paper , is stated in .",
    "sections  [ s3 ]  [ s5 ] contain the proof of . in section  [ s3 ]",
    "we construct the approximate solution @xmath119 .",
    "that is , we state the inner and outer expansions which define the function @xmath120 . in these asymptotic expansions functions",
    "appear , which are obtained as solutions of systems of algebraic and differential equations .",
    "these systems are also stated in section  [ s3 ] .",
    "the system for the outer expansion can be readily solved , and the solution of the system of ordinary differential equations for the inner expansion is more involved and is discussed in section  [ s4 ] . in two equations of this system a linear differential operator appears with kernel different from @xmath121 . in order that these differential equations be solvable the right hand sides must satisfy orthogonality conditions .",
    "the right hand sides contain the coefficients @xmath122 of the kinetic relation .",
    "the orthogonality conditions dictate the form of these coefficients ; therefrom the equation results . in section  [ s5 ]",
    "we verify that @xmath123 is really an asymptotic solution of the model equations  and prove the necessary estimates .",
    "in section  [ s6 ] we prove the estimate .",
    "the proof uses the residue , with which the function @xmath120 satisfies the equations  .",
    "the main difficulty in the proof is that though we want to prove that @xmath124 is bounded uniformly with respect to @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the residue term itself is not bounded for @xmath46 , but instead behaves like @xmath125 .    in the bibliography of @xcite",
    "we gave many references to the literature on existence , uniqueness and asymptotics for models containing the allen - cahn and cahn - hilliard equations .",
    "we refer the reader to that bibliography and discuss here only some publications , which are of interest in the construction of asymptotic solutions .",
    "we believe that for the model  an asymptotic solution was constructed and used to identify the associated sharp interface problem for the first time in @xcite , following earlier such investigations for other phase field models .",
    "for example , in @xcite these investigations were carried out for a model from solidification theory , which consists ot the allen - cahn equation coupled to the heat equation .",
    "the considerations in @xcite are formal , since it is not shown that the asymptotic solution converges to an exact solution of the model equations for @xmath45 . under the assumption that the associated sharp interface problems have smooth",
    "solutions , this was proved in @xcite for the allen - cahn equation , in @xcite for the cahn - hilliard equation , in @xcite for the model from solidification theory and in @xcite for a model consisting of the cahn - hilliard equation coupled with the elasticity equations .",
    "the proofs use variants of a spectral estimate derived in @xcite . for the model from solidification theory",
    "the associated sharp interface model is the mullins - sekerka model with surface tension .    in @xcite an asymptotic solution for the cahn - hilliard equation",
    "has recently been constructed with a method different from the one used in @xcite , and which is similar to our method .",
    "in @xcite the numerical efficiency of simulations based on the phase field model consisting of the allen - cahn equation coupled to the heat equation is studied .",
    "it is shown that for suitably chosen coefficients of the model the second order term in an asymptotic expansion of the solution vanishes . by arguments similar to the ones we gave in the above discussion",
    "it is seen that this improves the numerical efficiency of the model .",
    "this result has been improved and generalized in @xcite .",
    "a similar idea is also present in @xcite .",
    "since the construction of asymptotic solutions is based on sharp interface problems , a rigorous analysis of these problems is of special interest .",
    "of particular interest is the hele - shaw problem with surface tension , since this is the sharp interface problem associated with the cahn - hilliard equation .",
    "existence , uniqueness , and regularity of classical solutions of this problem have been investigated in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that if the initial data are close to a sphere then a classical solution exists and converges to spheres .",
    "existence of solutions to the mullins - sekerka problem mentioned above has been shown in @xcite .",
    "the model  describes the evolution of phase transitions in a solid when temperature effects are negligible .",
    "this model is the prototype of a large class of models obtained by extensions and generalizations of the model , which are used in the engineering sciences to simulate the behavior of complex and functional materials . from the very large literature in this field",
