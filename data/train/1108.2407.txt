    "finer analysis of the brain s constitution identifies anatomical structures , such as the cortical columns , composed of the order of few thousands to one hundred thousand neurons belonging to a few different species , in charge of specific functions , sharing the same input and strongly interconnected , communicating through the emission of action potentials after delays depending on the anatomical or functional distance between themselves .",
    "two interesting well - understood cortical areas are the primary visual cortex of certain mammals and the rat s barrel cortex . in the primary visual cortex v1",
    ", neurons can be divided into orientation preference columns responding to specific orientations in visual stimuli , forming specific patchy connections @xcite .",
    "similarly , the rat s barrel cortex presents a clear columnar organization , and neurons responding to the sensory information of a particular whisker anatomically gather into barrels  @xcite .",
    "more generally , it is now understood that brain s activity results from the interactions of different cells , among which neurons , manifesting highly complex behaviors often characterized by the intense presence of noise .",
    "the communication between two such columns is characterized by a delay due to the transport of information through axons at a finite speed and to the typical time the synaptic transmission takes .",
    "these delays have a clear role in shaping the neuronal activity , as established by different authors ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "several relevant brain states rely on the coordinated behaviors of large neural assemblies , and recently raised the interest of physiologists and computational neuroscientists , among which we shall cite the rapid complex answers to specific stimuli  @xcite , decorrelated activity  @xcite , large scale oscillations  @xcite , synchronization  @xcite , and spatio - temporal pattern formation  @xcite",
    ".    most computational models of neural area have relied on continuum limits ever since the seminal work of wilson , cowan and amari @xcite , in which the activity is represented through a macroscopic variable , the population - averaged firing rate , that is generally assumed to be deterministic .",
    "this approach successfully accounted for several phenomena , for instance for the problem of spatio - temporal pattern formation in spatially extended models ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . in this approach ,",
    "the effect of noise is neglected in large populations .",
    "increasingly many models now consider that the different intrinsic or extrinsic noise sources are a meaningful part of the neuronal signal rather than a pure disturbing effect , that conveys important information  @xcite .",
    "for instance , sparsely connected neural networks were studied , in wihch the sparse connectivity assumption allows studying regimes where the activity is uncorrelated  @xcite .",
    "again , the emergent global activity of the population in the limit of an infinite number of neurons is deterministic , and evolves according to a mean - field firing rate equation .",
    "the stochastic nature of the firing was also developed through such methods as the population density  @xcite , or from a markovian model governing the firing dynamics of the neurons in the network , where the transition probability satisfies master equation .",
    "this modeling recently gathered the interest of the community ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "most of these approaches are proved correct in some parameter regions using statistical physics tools such as path integrals and van - kampen expansions , and involve a moment expansion and truncation .",
    "we are interested here to start include noise at the level of each individual neuron . from the mathematical viewpoint ,",
    "each neuron is a diffusion process , and different neurons belong to particular populations in which they receive a common input and are interconnected in a similar fashion .",
    "these equations motivated by biological analysis , are studied in a probabilistic setting in a recent paper  @xcite , taking into account spatial information and delayed interconnections , using probabilistic methods from the propagation of chaos domain ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",

    ", this analysis provides a mean - field equation corresponding to the behavior of a particular neuron in the network .",
    "these equations , in the original general framework , apply to such neurons as the hodgkin - huxley and fitzhugh - nagumo neuron models , which are relevant representations of individual neuronal activity .",
    "we analyze here the implications of this result in that general setting in the discussion section .",
    "we also discuss an extended notion of synchronization , the _ synchronization in law _ , and provide general conditions for this property to occur in spatially extended mean - field neural fields systems .",
    "the mean - field equations obtained in  @xcite are implicit equations on probability distributions , and as such extremely hard to tame in general .",
    "simulations of such equatiosn are relatively hard to perform , as illustrated in the case where no delay and no spatial extension is taken into account  @xcite , and this difficulty makes it hard to identify qualitative effects of noise levels in such systems . in order to start uncovering the structure of the solutions of these equations and possible effects of noise levels each individual neuron",
    "is submitted to , we consider in section  [ sec : firingratemodels ] a simplified neuron model based on the description of firing - rates . in this particular case",
    ", we demonstrate that the solution of the complicated mean - field equations are gaussian , similarly to what was done in a way simpler model in  @xcite . characterizing the mean and covariance functions are hence sufficient to describe the dynamics of the solutions , and these are shown to exactly reduce to a set of deterministic delayed differential or integro - differential equations .",
    "the derivation of these equations and the bifurcations of these equations are studied , in the finite - population case ( section  [ sec : analysisfinite ] ) and an intricate bifurcation structure with the appearance of a cascade of hopf bifurcations as a function of noise levels and delays , that tend to accumulate as delays are increased in a restricted region of noise levels .",
    "this bifurcation structure results in the presence of an increasing number of unstable cycles that provoke extremely complex and irregular transient behaviors . in the continuous - populations case ( section  [ sec : analysisinfinite ] )",
    ", we show noise levels very strongly shape the form of the spatio - temporal solutions of the system .",
    "spatially homogeneous stationary or periodic solutions are found as a function of the noise levels .",
    "an additional state is exhibited for small values of the noise levels , in which spatially inhomogeneous , non - stationary spatio - temporal patterns with a complicated shape arise .",

    "the observations are essentially of the same kind as identified in the functional connectivity case . first of all , the bifurcation diagram of the spatially homogeneous equations can be segmented , like the previous case , into the same qualitative regions ( a)-(d ) , and it appeared in that case again that the spatially homogeneous states were unstable only in the small noise region ( a ) .",

    "s we find phenomena resembling to what was found the functional connectivity case : for small values of the noise parameter , a wave - splitting and interference phenomenon is found , progressively turning into quasi - periodic spatio - temporal waves , spatially - homogeneous oscillations and spatially homogeneous stationary solutions as the noise is increased .",
    "the wave splitting phenomenon is displayed on figure  [ fig : wavesplit ] , other cases resemble to the other patterns found and are not displayed .",
    "in this article , we addressed the problem of characterizing the dynamics of large assemblies of neurons that are spatially extended and interact after delays . modeling each individual neuron and characterizing their interactions , we derived neural field equations using a rigorous probabilistic mean - field theorem developed in  @xcite .",
    "the equations that were obtained in that article were implicit equations on stochastic processes probability distributions , and are extremely hard to tame in that general framework .",
    "we summarized the mathematical results obtained in a general setting , and provided a simple condition for the existence of solutions that are spatially homogeneous in law .",
    "the main result of the present article is the precise analysis of the dynamics of these equations in the particular case of firing - rate neurons , corresponding to the fact that membrane potential of the neurons have a linear intrinsic dynamics with nonlinear interactions .",
    "we were able in that case to reduce the mean - field equations to a set of delayed differential or integro - differential equations that are mathematically tractable , and using this description evidenced the important role of the microscopic noise in the dynamics in a series of examples of increasing complexity : finite - populations networks with delays , one - layer neural fields and two - layers neural fields .",
    "several phenomena such as cascades of hopf bifurcations , turing - hopf bifurcations and irregular spatio - temporal patterns were evidenced for specific levels of noise , and different levels of noise were identified corresponding to specific typical behaviors .",
    "the first obvious limitation of the study is the fact that this precise analysis reduces to the case of firing - rate neurons .",
    "though popular in the study of neural fields in the neuroscience community and widely used , this choice can be discussible in the present study .",
    "indeed , the model does not takes into account the highly nonlinear nature of several neuronal phenomena .",
    "this linear approximation is often seen as a heuristic mean - field limit itself , which can raise questions of the relevance of our present approach for neuroscience applications .",
    "the analysis developed here might hence better account for large - scale neuronal areas in which a very large number of cortical columns , described by the wilson and cowan model , s interact .",
    "as far as neurons are concerned , we may add that a large body of experimental results have proved successfully accounted by linear dynamics , generally relative to the specific nonlinearly determined fixed point of normal brain activity .",
    "these linear models , though less general and accurate that the nonlinear ones , yielded much greater insight , and in particular analytic treatment , of the cortical dynamics within their regimes of validity .",
    "probably the main reason why we chose this type of models is the reduction allowed by the gaussian nature of the solutions .",
    "indeed , as we demonstrated here , these models have the great advantage to be exactly and rigorously reducible to a set of tractable deterministic equations .",
    "this is hence a breach to go further in analyzing the complex dynamics of the neural fields mean - field equations , with the aim of further understanding nonlinear neuron models .",
    "the analysis provided here is the first ( and to our understanding , the only case where such an analytical study is possible ) to address precisely the dynamics of such complex mean - field equations , and can also be seen as a proof of concept of the dynamics of this class of equations , in particular the effects of noise and delays in these equations .",
    "all these reasons motivated the investigation of linear models to uncover the dynamics of the more complex nonlinear neural fields models .",
    "we expect that nonlinear equations of this kind will also reveal other behaviors that are not reproduced in our linear approach .",
    "a perspective of great interest also would be to derive from the non - linear mean - field equations systems governing macroscopic variables such as the mean firing - rate .",
    "this is a complex and deep question we are currently investigating .",
    "the general version of the results of theorems  [ thm : propagationchaossummary ] and [ thm : propagationchaosspacesummary ] have several implications in neuroscience that are discussed in  @xcite . among these",
    ", we may recall that the propagation of chaos property implies an independence between the behavior of finite sets of neurons , a surprising property in the classical view of neural populations postulating that the activity of neurons belonging to the same neuronal population , since sharing common input and strongly interconnected , was highly correlated .",
    "this view was recently contradicted by several experimental articles that exhibited high quality data corresponding to extremely low levels of correlation , in the primary visual area v1 of awake macaques  @xcite and in the rodent neocortex  @xcite .",
    "these results confirm that the chaotic state is biologically relevant , and also have several implications in neural coding , as shown in the analysis of the coding efficiency of decorrelated activity in  @xcite .",
    "the independence of the neural activity also reconciles spike  @xcite and rate  @xcite coding , two opposing conceptions of the neural activity , by emphasizing the role of collectivity : observing the state of several independent neurons during a time corresponding of the emission of a few spikes allows precise evaluation of the probability distribution of the interspike interval , hence the firing rate of neurons .",
    "one of the main new feature of the mean - field model is the consubstantial integration of the noise in the dynamics of the neural field : in the reduced equations obtained for the linear systems , we observed that noise appeared as a parameter in the sigmoidal function transforming the voltage into a mean - firing rate .",
    "this property quantified precisely the effect of noise in the behavior of neural fields through our mean - field equations .",
    "we studied a finite - population mean - field model with delays , and showed noise and delays shape the behavior of the system .",
    "as delays are increased , a sequence of hopf bifurcation appears in the system , that was observed numerically and accounted for analytically by the analysis of the characteristic roots for a particular system .",
    "this sequence of hopf bifurcations produces complex transient behaviors , and simultaneously with noise levels shape the nature of the response of the neural field , by producing either stationary or oscillatory responses .",
    "continuous neural fields were then analyzed with the particular aim of exhibiting qualitative changes in the behavior of a neural field due to noise levels .",
    "this is why we addressed the presence of turing - hopf bifurcations , first in a one - layer system semi - analytically , and then numerically in a more complex two - layers neural field .",
    "we evidenced several noise - induced dynamical turing - hopf bifurcations generating different spatio - temporal patterns , sometimes irregular and extremely complex .",
    "we also observed that noise also governs the stability of synchronized in law behaviors .",
    "the periodic solutions triggered by an increase in the noise standard deviation correspond at the level of the network to solutions in which in neuron fires synchronously , in systems that present a unique stable fixed point when neurons are not driven by noise .",
    "noise hence appear to have a very strong structuring effect on the dynamics of the system , which can appear at first sight counterintuitive as noise is usually seen as altering the structure of the activity .",
    "these observations add to different phenomena documented in the neural networks literatures , as for instance coherent oscillations in neural networks  @xcite where evidences for the presence of noise - induced in noisy integrate - and - fire neurons .",
    "the phenomena observed in our analysis differs from the more classical stochastic resonance or coherence resonance phenomena well documented in the neurocomputational literature ( see e.g.  @xcite for a review of the effect of noise in excitable systems ) , since these correspond to the fact that there exists a particular level of noise maximizing the regularity of an oscillatory output related to periodic forcing ( stochastic resonance ) or to intrinsic oscillations ( coherence resonance ) .",
    "another important result that can be derived from the present analysis is the ability to define classes of parameter ranges attached to a few generic bifurcation diagrams as functions of the parameters .",
    "this property suggests model - based strategies for parameter evaluations in experimental measurements .",
    "the present analysis , reducing noise levels to a simple parameter of a dynamical system , allowed going further into the analysis of the functional role of noise in the brain , a question currently widely debated in the neuroscience community , and relates this question to the presence of synchronized oscillations , as we showed in our different numerical simulations that noise levels determined the presence of oscillations , and the type of noise ( additive or synaptic ) the sharpness of the synchronization of oscillations across different neurons or areas .",
    "several extensions of the present study with applications in neuroscience and in applied mathematics are envisioned .",
    "the first would be , as already mentioned , to investigate similar phenomena in biologically relevant models and to study the behavior of the solutions of the mean - field equations in that mathematically much more complex setting that would include in particular nonlinear , excitable intrinsic dynamics and different ionic populations .",
    "the mean - field equations in that setting are complicated implicit stochastic equations , that can be written as a non - local nonlinear partial differential equation on the space of probability distributions .",
    "these equations are extremely hard to analyze directly , and the proof of concepts provided by this simpler analysis foreshadows interesting behaviors .",
    "an additional intricacy of the model is that , as we observed in our analysis , the system does not always present stationary solutions , and when these exist , they are not necessarily stable .",
    "cycles were found , and bistable states between stationary and periodic behaviors were found , as well as irregular states in spatially extended systems . analyzing the solutions of the nonlinear mean - field equations will hence present interesting technical difficulties and probably complex behaviors , and necessitates the development of techniques to analyze the convergence of such stochastic equations towards periodic solutions .",
    "another important direction in the development of this work would consist in fitting the microscopic model to biological measurements .",
    "this would yield a new neural assembly model for large scale areas and develop studies on the appearance of stochastic seizures and rhythmic activity in relationship with different parameters of the model , integrating the presence of noise in a mathematically and biologically relevant manner .",
    "a question that remains largely open is the question of the number of neurons per population .",
    "motivated by the fact that typical sizes of the neuronal populations are generally orders of magnitude larger than the number of neural populations ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , we followed the choice made in  @xcite and assumed that the number of neurons in each population was increasing fast enough with the number of neurons ( assumption of equation  ) , which left room for the propagation of chaos to occur in each population .",
    "if this condition is not satisfied , different limits can appear , and characterizing these different limits is a challenging mathematical question .",
    "another very interesting and deep question in this setting is the question of mean - field limits in slow - fast systems , problem that is highly relevant for different aspects of the neuronal behavior , and which raises a number of technical and applied questions .",
    "in this appendix we prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions of the fully synchronized system given by equations  .",

    "<S> the cortex is composed of large - scale cell assemblies sharing the same individual properties and receiving the same input , in charge of certain functions , and subject to noise . </S>",
    "<S> such assemblies are characterized by specific space locations and space - dependent delayed interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the mean - field equations for such systems were rigorously derived in a recent paper for general models , under mild assumptions on the network , using probabilistic methods . </S>",
    "<S> we summarize and investigate general implications of this result . </S>",
    "<S> we then address the dynamics of these stochastic neural field equations in the case of firing - rate neurons . </S>",
    "<S> this is a unique case where the very complex stochastic mean - field equations exactly reduce to a set of delayed differential or integro - differential equations on the two first moments of the solutions , this reduction being possible due to the gaussian nature of the solutions . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained equations differ from more customary approaches in that it incorporates intrinsic noise levels nonlinearly and make explicit the interaction between the mean activity and its correlations . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the dynamics of these equations , with a particular focus on the influence of noise levels on shaping the collective response of neural assemblies and brain states . </S>",
    "<S> cascades of hopf bifurcations are observed as a function of noise amplitude , for noise levels small enough , and delays , in a finite - population system . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of spatially homogeneous solutions in law is discussed in different non - delayed neural fields and an instability , as noise amplitude is varied , of the homogeneous state , is found . in these regimes , very complex irregular and structured spatio - temporal patterns of activity are exhibited including in particular wave or bump splitting .    </S>",
