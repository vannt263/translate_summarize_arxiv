    "the field of neutrino oscillations is rapidly developing .",
    "the goals of the current and planed set of accelerator - based neutrino experiments  @xcite are the precision measurements of observed neutrino mass splitting and the detailed study of the neutrino mixing matrix .",
    "the data of these experiments will greatly extend the statistics due to extremely intense neutrino beamline .    to study the neutrino oscillation effects on the terrestrial distance scale , the neutrino beams cover the energy range from a few hundred mev to several gev .",
    "in this energy range , the dominant contribution to the neutrino - nucleus cross section comes from the charged - current ( cc ) quasi - elastic ( qe ) reactions and resonance production processes .",
    "the cross section data in this energy range are rather scarce and were taken on the targets , which are not used in the neutrino oscillation experiments ( i.e. water , iron , lead or plastic ) .",
    "in this situation , the statistical uncertainties should be negligible as compared to systematic errors in the incident neutrino flux , neutrino interaction model and the detector effects on the neutrino events selection and neutrino energy reconstruction . apparently ,",
    "these uncertainties produce systematic errors in the extraction of oscillation parameters .",
    "to evaluate the neutrino mass squared difference in the muon neutrino disappearance experiments , the probability of @xmath3 disappearance versus neutrino energy is measured . because the ccqe interaction represents a two - particle scattering process , it forms a good signal sample , and the neutrino energy may be estimated using the kinematics of this reaction .",
    "there are two ways of measuring the neutrino energy : either kinematic or calorimetric reconstruction . in detectors with the energy threshold for",
    "proton detection @xmath4 gev ( cherenkov detectors ) the muon neutrino ccqe interactions will produce the one - track events , i.e. only muons are detected in the final states .",
    "the kinematic reconstruction is applied for these events . assuming the target nucleon to be at rest inside the nucleus",
    ", the correlation between the incident neutrino energy and a reconstructed muon momentum and scattering angle is used in this method .    in the fine - grained detectors the two - track ccqe events",
    "are detected , and the calorimetric reconstruction can be applied , if the particle identification of the second track and the resolution for proton momentum are reliable . in this case",
    "the visible neutrino energy is simply a sum of the reconstructed muon energy and kinematic proton energy . in this paper",
    "we consider the procedures for neutrino energy reconstruction , which are based on the kinematics of the ccqe interaction .",
    "in general , the detector efficiency and energy response are highly dependent on the type of interaction : qe or non - qe ( the resonance and deep inelastic scattering ) .",
    "the monte carlo ( mc ) simulation of the detector response to neutrino interactions is used for tuning the values of cuts for separation of the qe and non - qe ( nqe ) events and for estimating the efficiency of detecting the ccqe events after all cuts . to model the scattering from a nuclei ,",
    "the most part of an event generator  @xcite is based on the rfgm  @xcite , in which the nucleus is described as a system of quasi - free nuclei with a flat nucleon momentum distribution up to the same fermi momentum @xmath5 and nuclear binding energy @xmath6 . but this model does not take into account the nuclear shall structure , the final state interaction ( fsi ) between the outgoing nucleon and residual nucleus and the presence of short - range nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) correlations , leading to appearance of a high - momentum and high - energy component in the nucleon momentum - energy distribution in the target .",
    "the comparison with the high - precision electron scattering data has shown  @xcite that the accuracy of the rfgm prediction becomes poor at low @xmath7 , where the nuclear effects are largest , and this model fails  @xcite in application to exclusive cross sections .",
    "the modern quasi - elastic neutrino scattering data ( the ccqe event distribution as a function of @xmath7 )  @xcite also reveal the inadequacies in the present neutrino cross section simulation .",
    "the data / mc disagreement shows the data deficit in the low @xmath7 region ( @xmath8 gev@xmath2 ) and the data excess in the high @xmath7 region .",
    "the disagreement at low @xmath7 would eventually result in the data / mc disagreement in the reconstructed neutrino energy .",
    "the relativistic distorted - wave impulse approximation , which takes into account the nuclear shall structure and fsi effects , was developed for description of electron - nucleus scattering , and it was successfully tested against the data  @xcite . the rdwia approach was also applied to neutrino - nucleus ( @xmath9 ) interactions for calculating the exclusive and inclusive qe cross sections  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the fsi effects on the inclusive cross section in the presence of the nn - correlations were estimated .",
    "the aim of this work is twofold .",
    "first , we compute the rdwia ccqe cross section versus @xmath7 for muon neutrino scattering off oxygen .",
    "second , we show the nuclear - model dependence of the efficiency of two - track ccqe events selection .",
    "we also estimate systematic uncertainties in the reconstructed neutrino energy within the rdwia and rfgm taking into account the nucleon momentum distribution in the target , i.e. the nucleon fermi motion effect .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present briefly the formalism for ccqe scattering process and the rdwia model .",
    "the nuclear - model dependence of cuts , which are applied for ccqe events selection , as well as the neutrino energy reconstruction methods are discussed in sec .",
    "the results of numerical calculations are presented in sec .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "v. in appendix a we present the equation for neutrino energy , and in appendix b the expressions for the moments of the reconstructed neutrino energy distribution are given .",
