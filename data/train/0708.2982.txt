    "currently two scenarios are considered to generate polarized positrons for the ilc . both are utilizing low energy circularly polarized photons and high energy electrons to boost these photons to mev energies and then convert them into electron - positron pairs . each method named after the photon source as undulator  @xcite or laser  @xcite based positron production .",

    "for a laser scattering compton photons and @xmath0 tungsten target , title=\"fig : \" ]   for a laser scattering compton photons and @xmath0 tungsten target , title=\"fig : \" ]    to achieve high number of positrons the target should be thick , of the order of one radiation length , @xmath1 hence , the mev photons may initiate showers , or at least 2 - 3 generations of particles and we would need a proper tracking tool like egs or geant .    r0.5    [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     to address the polarisation issue one have to take care also about the polarisation tracking .",
    "this has been incorporated into the egs by k.  flttmann  @xcite and into the geant-4 by desy - zeuthen e166 group  @xcite . here",
    "we will use geant-3  @xcite modified in a way to account polarisation transfer in the processes summarized in table  [ tab1 ] . for the multiple scattering and @xmath2 energy loss continuous approximations",
    "there are certain difficulties to treat the depolarisation especially for energies below the critical @xmath3 and this is mostly because lack of the theoretical and experimental input .",
    "anyhow , for our calculations we use straight trajectory / no depolarisation for the @xmath2 loss and @xmath4 approximation as depolarisation factor for a @xmath5 multiple scattering angle with @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the lorentz factor .",
    "one example of the simulation outcome for a @xmath8 tungsten is shown on figure  [ fig:1 ] where initial photons originate from a helical 1 m long undulator with k=0.19 on a 46.6  gev energy electron beam ( e166 experiment configuration ) .",
    "on the lower right figure one can find also total number of the positrons / electrons for the @xmath9 simulated initial photons .",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ] displays results for the initial compton photons produced by a @xmath10 laser , scattered on 1.3  gev electrons with a crossing angle of 8  deg .",
    "number of simulated compton events is @xmath11 .",
    "using positrons intensity @xmath12 and polarisation @xmath13 distributions we can    r0.5     form a product @xmath14 ( figure  [ fig:3 ] ) to serve as a figure of merit for the target material and thickness optimization .",
    "to choose best production target we try tungsten and titanium changing their thickness by @xmath15 steps , each time recording the positrons yield , polarisation and energy at the maximum figure of merit .",
    "resulting numbers are displayed on figure  [ fig:4 ] and figure  [ fig:5 ] for the undulator and laser case respectively .",
    "one can note that in general the positron polarisation depends weekly on the target thickness i.e. the target optimization could be done by maximizing only the positron yield .",
    "the distributions also indicate that the tungsten is preferable with a thickness of @xmath16 for the undulator and @xmath17 for the laser case .          for the laser produced positrons.,title=\"fig : \" ]   for the laser produced positrons.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
