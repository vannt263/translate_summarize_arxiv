    "the layered structure of cuprates makes these materials good candidates for observing zeeman response to a magnetic field @xmath2 directed parallel to the cu - o planes @xcite .",
    "moreover , the @xmath3 symmetry of the order parameter ( hereafter @xmath0-wave ) leads in principle to substantial differences with respect to the zeeman response of isotropic @xmath1-wave superconductors .",
    "for example , at zero temperature , the tunneling conductance @xmath4 of a @xmath0-wave superconductor - insulator - metal junction is nonzero for finite voltages @xmath5 provided @xmath6 @xcite , in sharp contrast to ordinary isotropic @xmath1-wave junctions for which @xmath4 is zero for @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the energy gap and @xmath9 is the electron charge @xcite . on the other hand , the phase diagrams of pure @xmath1-wave and @xmath0-wave superconductors in the presence of a zeeman magnetic field have similar qualitative behaviours .",
    "for example , for both symmetries of the order parameter , a first order phase transition to the normal state is found at low temperatures and for sufficiently strong magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "however there are quantitative differences .",
    "for example , at @xmath10 , the critical field is @xmath11 for @xmath1-wave @xcite and @xmath12 for @xmath0-wave @xcite , where @xmath13 is the zero temperature order parameter without magnetic field .    so far ,",
    "systematic theoretical studies of the zeeman response of anisotropic superconductors have been focused on the clean limit of @xmath0-wave bcs formulation .",
    "a more realistic situation would require the inclusion of impurity effects , since these are known to have important effects on both thermodynamic and spectral quantities @xcite .",
    "moreover , in addition to the disorder potential , the quasiparticles are also spin - orbit coupled to the impurities , so that the zeeman response is affected by spin - mixing processes . an additional source for spin - orbit effects could be provided by the electric fields in the vicinity of the conducting cu - o layers and the charge reservoirs interfaces .",
    "although , in the past years , the effect of spin - orbit coupling has been largely studied for isotropic @xmath1-wave superconductors @xcite , the corresponding situation for @xmath0-wave superconductors ( or other anisotropic symmetries ) is still unknown .",
    "however , it is expected that the spin - orbit effects on the zeeman response of @xmath0-wave superconductors differ from those of @xmath1-wave superconductors in a qualitative way . in fact , already at zero magnetic field , the spin - orbit scattering is pair - breaking and reduces both the critical temperature @xmath14 and the order parameter @xcite . as a consequence , for @xmath15 , the pair - breaking effects of both the external magnetic field and the spin - orbit coupling add together .",
    "this situation must be contrasted with the @xmath1-wave case , where the spin - orbit potential is not pair - breaking and competes with the zeeman response reducing the pair - breaking effect of the magnetic field @xcite .    in this paper , the effects of both impurity and spin - orbit scattering potentials are studied within a self - consistent born approximation for @xmath0-wave superconductors .",
    "both thermodynamic and spectral properties are investigated and compared with those of @xmath1-wave superconductors .",
    "let us consider a two - dimensional system with electrons ( holes ) moving in the @xmath16-@xmath17 plane under the effect of an external magnetic field @xmath2 directed along the plane .",
    "in this situation , the coupling of the orbital motion of the charge carriers to the magnetic field is vanishingly small . in the following , no particular pairing mechanism is assumed and the condensate will be described within the bcs formalism . in this framework ,",
    "the hamiltonian is : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the bohr magneton . for a @xmath21 symmetry of the gap ,",
    "@xmath22 is parametrized as follows : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the polar angle in the @xmath25-@xmath26 plane . in eq.([hami0 ] ) , @xmath27 and @xmath28 refer to the spin direction along and opposite to the direction of @xmath2 and it is assumed that @xmath2 is directed along the @xmath16 direction , so that @xmath29 .    the interaction hamiltonian describing the coupling to the impurities located randomly at @xmath30 is given below : @xmath31\\cdot \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\sigma$}_{\\alpha\\beta } ) c^{\\dagger}_{{\\bf k}\\alpha}c_{{\\bf k}'\\beta},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 and @xmath33 refer to the non - magnetic and spin - orbit coupling to the impurities , respectively ( @xmath34 is the fermi momentum ) . from the elliott relation @xcite ,",
    "the impurity and spin - orbit potentials are roughly given by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the shift of the g - factor which , for cuprates , is of order @xmath37 . here",
    ", however , @xmath32 and @xmath33 will be treated as independent variables .",
    "note that , since the momenta @xmath38 and @xmath39 are defined in the @xmath16-@xmath17 plane , the spin - momentum dependence of the spin - orbit interaction simplifies to : @xmath40\\cdot \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\sigma$}_{\\alpha\\beta}= [ { \\bf k}\\times{\\bf k}']\\cdot { \\bf \\hat{z}}\\,\\sigma^z_{\\alpha\\beta}.\\ ] ] since the spins have been quantized along the @xmath16-axis , the spin - orbit coupling leads to scattering events always accompanied by spin - flip transitions .",
    "the following analysis is simplified by introducing the usual four - components field operators @xcite : @xmath41;\\,\\ ,   \\psi^{\\dagger}_{{\\bf k}}=\\left[c^{\\dagger}_{{\\bf k}\\uparrow } , c^{\\dagger}_{-{\\bf k}\\downarrow},c_{{\\bf k}\\uparrow } , c_{-{\\bf k}\\downarrow}\\right].\\ ] ] from eqs.([hami0],[hamiimp ] ) it is possible to evaluate the equation of motion of the field operator @xmath42 in the imaginary time @xmath43 : @xmath44\\cdot { \\bf \\hat{z}}\\,\\tau_1\\right]\\psi_{{\\bf k}'},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the products @xmath45 are @xmath46 matrices acting on the field operators ( [ four ] ) .",

    "are assumed to be sufficiently weak to justify a self - consistent born approximation for the self - energy @xmath58 .",
    "because of the momentum dependence of the spin - orbit interaction , the feynmann diagrams describing the born approximation do not involve impurity  spin - orbit mixed terms and @xmath58 is given by the diagrams showed in fig .",
    "[ bornfig1 ] .",
    "therefore , by using eq.([pot ] ) , the self - consistent born approximation for @xmath58 reads : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the concentration of impurities .",
    "equations ( [ green3 ] ) and ( [ self ] ) must be solved self - consistently and the solution can be written in terms of the following renormalized green s function @xcite : @xmath61 where for brevity the momentum and frequency dependence of the tilded quantities has been omitted .",
    "the renormalized quantities can be calculated by substituting eq.([green4 ] ) into eqs.([green3],[self ] ) .",
    "if there is particle - hole symmetry , the quasiparticle dispersion remains unaffected by the presence of impurities , _",

    "in fact , non - magnetic impurities does not renormalize the gap function when this has @xmath0-wave symmetry @xcite whereas the spin - orbit interaction , by means of the angular function @xmath77 , provides a finite renormalization .",
    "this can be readily seen by realizing that if @xmath83 is of the form given by eq.([gap1 ] ) , then a consistent solution of eq.([delta2 ] ) is provided by setting @xmath84 , where @xmath65 is the solution of : @xmath85^{1/2}},\\ ] ] and , in the same way , eq.([omega2 ] ) becomes : @xmath86^{1/2 } }   + \\frac{1}{\\tau_{so}}\\int\\frac{d\\phi}{2\\pi}\\sin(\\phi)^2 \\frac{\\tilde{\\omega}_{\\mp } } { [ \\tilde{\\omega}_{\\mp}^2+\\tilde{\\delta}_{\\mp}^2\\cos(2\\phi)^2]^{1/2}}. \\nonumber \\\\\\ ] ] in obtaining eqs.([delta3],[omega3 ] ) , it has been used the identity : @xmath87= \\int\\frac{d\\phi}{2\\pi}\\sin(\\phi)^2 f[-\\cos(2\\phi)],\\ ] ] where @xmath88 $ ] is a general function of @xmath89 .",
    "as expected , the scalar impurity scattering contribution has disappeared from the gap renormalization ( [ delta3 ] ) . on the contrary",

    "when @xmath94 , equation ( [ swave ] ) reduces to @xmath95 and does not depend on the spin - orbit scattering rate while eq.([u1 ] ) still depends on @xmath43 and @xmath96 .",
    "in fact , in a @xmath0-wave superconductor , both the non - magnetic impurity and the spin - orbit scatterings are pair breaking and they tend to suppress superconductivity @xcite .",
    "when @xmath6 , it is therefore expected that the zeeman response of a @xmath0-wave superconductor differs qualitatively from that of a @xmath1-wave condensate .",

    "3 , the phase diagram is insensitive to @xmath123 , while finite values of @xmath124 enhance the critical field for all temperatures .",
    "moreover , the temperature interval of first - order phase transition ( dashed lines ) decreases as @xmath124 increases and for @xmath125 the transition becomes continuous for all temperatures @xcite .",
    "this behavior is due to the spin - mixing effect of the spin - orbit interaction which lowers the zeeman response and consequently the depairing effect of the magnetic field . on the other hand , in the @xmath0-wave case shown in fig .",
    "4 , the spin - orbit scattering is pair breaking and for @xmath126 the critical field is lowered .",
    "this situation can be understood by realizing that finite values of @xmath124 lead to a weakening of the superconducting state @xcite so that , with respect to the @xmath127 case , lower values of @xmath128 are needed to suppress completely superconductivity .",

    "it is important to stress that the remarkable difference between the @xmath0-wave and @xmath1-wave phase diagrams has been obtained in the born limit of non - magnetic and spin - orbit impurity scatterings .",
    "however it is well known that in high-@xmath14 superconductors the effect of disorder is best described by the strongly resonant limit of the impurity potential so that the born approximation may result inadequate . in practice",

    "having described the effect of @xmath131 and @xmath124 on the phase diagram , it is interesting to investigate also how the spectral properties are modified . to this end , equation ( [ u1 ] ) must be analytically continued to the real axis by setting @xmath132 and @xmath133 . in this way",

    "the two dos per spin state , @xmath141 ( dashed lines ) and @xmath142 ( solid lines ) , show a clear zeeman splitting and for @xmath143 the total dos @xmath144 is different from zero as expected for a @xmath0-wave superconductor . for @xmath126",
    "the total dos at @xmath143 is enhanced at the expenses of the coherence peaks which show a decrease of spectral weight . moreover , at @xmath145 , @xmath142 develops a structure ( marked by the arrows ) which becomes a peak at @xmath129 .",

    "the origin of this peak can be understood by the following reasoning . at the fermi wave - vector , and for a pure superconductor ,",
    "the quasiparticle energies for spin up and down are @xmath148 and therefore , depending on the values of @xmath128 and @xmath8 , two quasiparticles with different spin orientation and angles @xmath24 can have equal energies .",
    "for example , for @xmath149 and @xmath150 , the two energies @xmath151 and @xmath152 are equal to @xmath153 if @xmath154 .",

    "[ bornfig6 ] the low energy peak is more pronounced for @xmath155 where , since @xmath156 , the condition @xmath154 is nearly fulfilled .",

    "both the phase diagram and the quasiparticle density of states show features qualitatively different from those of a @xmath1-wave superconductor .",
    "in fact , by increasing the value of the spin - orbit scattering parameter @xmath121 the critical field @xmath157 is strongly lowered whereas in a @xmath1-wave superconductor @xmath157 increases .",
    "moreover , the influence of @xmath124 on the superconducting state is much stronger for the @xmath0-wave symmetry . concerning the spectral properties , the zeeman splitted density of states of a @xmath0-wave superconductor shows interesting features which are missing in a @xmath1-wave superconductor . in fact , for sufficiently large values of @xmath124 and/or @xmath128 a resonant peak develops at energies close to @xmath158 .",
    "the origin of this feature is given by the anisotropy of the order parameter and the spin - flip transitions due to the spin - orbit scattering .",
    "an important open question concerns with the possibility of going beyond the born approximation and employing a t - matrix approach for the zeeman response in the presence of impurity and spin - orbit scattering centres in order to test the solidity of the results here presented .                            in ref.@xcite",
