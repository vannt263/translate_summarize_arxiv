    "in few years since their discovery  @xcite pulsars have been identified with rotating neutron stars , first predicted theoretically by baade & zwicky ( 1934a , b , c ) , endowed with a strong magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "+ it is widely believed that there are no alternative models able to provide as satisfactory an explanation for the wide variety of pulsar phenomena as those built around the rotating neutron star model .",
    "nevertheless , recently we have proposed ( cea 2004a , b ) a new class of compact stars , p - stars , which is challenging the standard paradigm .",
    "+ p - stars are compact stars made of up and down quarks in @xmath0-equilibrium with electrons in a chromomagnetic condensate . in our previous studies ( cea 2004a , b )",
    ", we find that p - stars are able to account for compact stars , stars with radius comparable with canonical neutron stars , as well as super massive compact objects .",
    "moreover , we show that p - stars once formed are absolutely stable . the cooling curves of p - stars compare rather well with observations",
    ". we also suggested that p - matter produced at the cosmological deconfinement phase transition could be a viable candidate for baryonic cold dark matter .",
    "+ in addition , in cea ( 2006 ) we discuss p - stars endowed with super strong dipolar magnetic field .",
    "we find that soft gamma - ray repeaters and anomalous x - ray pulsars can be understood within our theory .",
    "in particular , we point out that within our p - star model there is a quite natural mechanism to account for the generation of dipolar surface magnetic fields up to @xmath1 .",
    "we succeed in obtaining a well defined criterion to distinguish rotation powered pulsars from magnetic powered pulsars .",
    "we show that glitches , that in our theory are triggered by magnetic dissipative effects in the inner core , explain both the quiescent emission and burst activity in soft gamma - ray repeaters and anomalous x - ray pulsars .",
    "we are able to account for braking and normal glitches observed in soft gamma - ray repeaters and anomalous x - ray pulsars .",
    "we discuss and explain the observed anti correlation between hardness ratio and burst intensity . within our p - star theory",
    "we are able to account quantitatively for light curves from both gamma - ray repeaters and anomalous x - ray pulsars . + it is worthwhile to briefly discuss the theoretical foundation of our proposal .",
    "indeed , quite recently , the qcd vacuum was probed by means of an external constant abelian chromomagnetic field on the lattice  @xcite .",
    "we found that by increasing the strength of the applied external field the deconfinement temperature decreases towards zero .",
    "in other words , there is a critical field @xmath2 such that for @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the color gauge coupling and @xmath5 is the strength of the chromomagnetic field directed along the third direction in color space ) the gauge system is in the deconfined phase ( the color meissner effect ) . as a consequence , we see that there is an intimate connection between abelian chromomagnetic fields and color confinement .",
    "the existence of a critical chromomagnetic field is compatible with the qcd vacumm behaving like a disordered chromomagnetic condensate , for strong enough chromomagnetic field strengths enforce long range colour order thereby destroying confinement . in a seminal paper , r. p. feynman ( 1981 ) argued that qcd in two spatial dimensions the confining vacuum at large distances is a chromomagnetic condensate disordered by the gauge invariance .",
    "the confinement of colors comes from the existence of a mass gap and the absence of colour long range order . as a matter of fact",
    ", we were able to show that , indeed , the qcd vacuum in three spatial dimensions does display at large distance a mass gap and no colour long range order and that the vacuum displays the color meissner effect .",
    "we find that chiral symmetry breaking for quarks in the fundamental color representation is an inevitable consequence of the disordered chromomagnetic condensate .",
    "finally , we argue that the deconfined vacuum behaves more like a correlated liquid than an ideal gas , in accordance with recent results from heavy ion experiments .",
    "this , in turns , leads us to the conclusion that the deconfined qcd vacuum is characterised by long - range chromomagnetic correlations and whence p - matter , namely almost massless up and down quarks immersed in a chromomagnetic condensate , must be quite close to the true qcd deconfined state . in absence of strong gravity effects , the chromomagnetic condensate in p - matter is of order of the critical field strength , which turns out to be @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "+ note that we are using natural units where @xmath7 . in this units",
    "@xmath4 is dimensionless and @xmath8 has dimension of energy . to switch to cgs units",
    "it suffices to replace @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "+ on the other hand , when including the effects of gravity it turns out that p - matter gives rise to compact stars ( p - stars ) , which are more stable than neutron stars  @xcite whatever the value of @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , we have in general that in p - stars the chromomagnetic condensate must satisfy the constraint : @xmath11 we see , then , that the chromomagnetic condensate in p - stars acts like a dynamical effective bag constant which can be varied according to eq .",
    "( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "the actual value of the chromomagnetic condensate depends only on the central density of the compact star . in this way , p - stars are able to overcome the gravitational collapse irrespective to the stellar mass . indeed , as discussed in cea ( 2004a )",
    ", our p - stars do not admit the existence of an upper limit to the mass of a completely degenerate configuration .",
    "in other words , our peculiar equation of state of degenerate up and down quarks in a chromomagneticn condensate allows the existence of finite equilibrium states for stars of arbitrary mass . to see this",
    ", we note that on dimensional ground from the tolman - oppenheimer - volkov equation  @xcite we get : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the stellar central density . as a consequence",
    "we obtain : @xmath15 for reader s convenience , it is worthwhile to rewrite the previous equations in cgs units .",

    "( [ 1.2 ] ) and ( [ 1.3 ] ) we see that by decreasing the strength of the chromomagnetic condensate we increase the mass and radius of the star , while the ratio @xmath21 depends only on @xmath22 .",
    "it turns out  @xcite that the function @xmath23 defined in eq .",
    "( [ 1.3 ] ) is less than 1 for any allowed values of @xmath24 . by varying the chromomagnetic condensate strength in the allowed range",
    ", the m - r p - star curves span the allowed region in the m - r plane .",
    "indeed , a clear observational evidence in favour of p - stars would be the detection of pulsars with mass above @xmath25 .",
    "+ in the present paper we focus on few selected topics with the aim to furnish further compelling evidences in support of our proposal . in section  [ masses ] we compare recent determination of masses and radii of isolated and binary pulsars with our p - star model . in section  [ cooling ] , after a brief review of cooling in p - stars , we compare our theoretical cooling curves with several observational data . finally , we draw our conclusions in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "in a recent analysis of the low - mass x - ray binary pulsar exo 0748 - 676 observational data zel ( 2006 ) concluded that the determination of the mass and radius of this pulsar appears to rule out all the soft equations of sate of neutron - star matter .",

    "it follows , then , that on the surface of the star there is a positively charged layer which is able to support a thin crust of ordinary matter .",
    "the vacuum gap between the core and the crust of order of several hundred @xmath92 leads to a strong suppression of the surface temperature with respect to the core temperature . in principle",
    ", the actual relation between @xmath86 and @xmath93 can be obtained by studying the crust and core thermal interactions . in any case , our phenomenological relation eq .",
    "( [ 3.3 ] ) allows a wide variation of @xmath86 , which encompasses the neutron star relation ( see , for instance , gudmundsson 1983 ) .",
    "moreover , as we discuss below , our cooling curves display a rather weak dependence on the parameter @xmath94 in eq .",
    "( [ 3.3 ] ) .",
    "+ in cea ( 2004a ) we showed that the dominant cooling processes by neutrino emission are the direct @xmath0-decay quark reactions  @xcite : @xmath95 we find the following neutrino luminosity  @xcite : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the temperature in units of @xmath98 @xmath99 , and @xmath100 is the nuclear density .",

    "this peculiar dependence on the core temperature is due to the presence of the strong chromomagnetic condensate which strongly constraints the quark transverse motion .",
