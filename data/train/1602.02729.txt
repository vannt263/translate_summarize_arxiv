    "the formation of rotationally supported disk ( rsd ) from magnetized dense molecular cloud cores is a long - standing problem in star formation . although rsds are frequently observed around young stellar objects @xcite , including deeply embedded sources @xcite , theoretical studies have found it difficult to form such disks due to strong magnetic braking which catastrophically removes most angular momentum of circumstellar gas .",
    "this is the so - called `` magnetic braking catastrophe '' in disk formation @xcite .    in the axisymmetric ideal mhd limit ,",
    "the magnetic field strength required for such catastrophic magnetic braking is moderate @xcite .",
    "the observed magnetization of dense cores , quantified by the dimensionless mass - to - flux ratio @xmath4 , has a typical value of @xmath5 23 from oh zeeman survey @xcite .",
    "although uncertainty exists due to oh depletion at high densities @xcite , the bulk of dense core should still have @xmath5 a few . such a strong magnetic field , if not sufficiently decoupled from collapsing matter , can transport most angular momentum away from the circumstellar region via magnetic braking , and hence suppress the formation of rsds @xcite .",
    "in reality , dense cores are only slightly ionized @xcite , and magnetic fields are expected to at least partially decouple from neutral matter through non - ideal mhd effects , including ambipolar diffusion ( ad ) , ohmic dissipation , and hall effect ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "their effects on disk formation have been studied previously @xcite ; however , whether a large ( say 50  au sized ) , long - lived rsd can form or not remains unclear .",
    "most of these studies show that ad and ohmic dissipation can only help to form a small rsd ( < 10  au ) early in the first core phase @xcite ; but whether such disk can survive or grow in the subsequent evolution is unclear due to numerical difficulties .",
    "the rsd formed via hall effect can indeed be larger ( @xmath030  au ) , yet only when the direction of magnetic field is nearly anti - parallel to the net rotation axis of dense core @xcite . in a realistic turbulent core , it is unclear whether such a requirement in field geometry can be satisfied throughout the entire protostellar evolution phase .",
    "therefore , the inconsistency between disks formed in theoretical calculations and those observed around young stellar objects remains unresolved .",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggest that in order to bridge this gap , magnetic diffusivity over a large circumstellar region must be at least 1 order of magnitude above the classical value used in most studies .    the magnetic diffusivity due to non - ideal mhd effects is essentially determined by chemistry and microscopic physical processes @xcite .",
    "the key is to calculate the fractional abundances of charged species ( electron , ions , and charged grains ) and their effective conductivities .",
    "however , uncertainty still exists in such calculations due to the lack of observational constraints on grain size distribution in dense molecular cloud cores ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "typical chemistry models either choose a single grain size ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or adopt the standard mrn ( mathis - rumpl - nordsieck ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) size distribution from diffuse interstellar clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the choice of grain size can greatly affect the ionization fraction @xcite and the magnetic diffusivity @xcite ; because grains not only provide surface for recombination of ions and electrons , but also couple to the magnetic field if they are charged ( the smaller the grain , the stronger the coupling ) .",
    "therefore , non - ideal mhd studies on disk formation should pay special attention to the effect of grain size on magnetic diffusivities .",
    "recent studies have shown evidence of magnetic diffusivity enhancement by removing very small grains .",
    "@xcite find that removal of @xmath010@xmath6 grains greatly reduces the hall conductivity and hence increases the diffusivity for hall effect ; however , its impact on ambipolar diffusivity has not been addressed .",
    "@xcite explore different single sized grains ranging from @xmath00.010.1  @xmath7 m , and reveal that the effective magnetic diffusivity ( including both ohmic dissipation and ad ) with @xmath00.1  @xmath7 m grains is 12 orders of magnitude higher than that with a mrn size distribution ( see their fig.2 ) .",
    "however , they did not elaborate on how this affects disk formation .",
    "@xcite apply post - processing chemistry models to the ideal mhd simulations of @xcite , and find that the size of matter - field decoupling region increases significantly with a `` truncated '' mrn distribution ( @xmath8 m ) compared with the full mrn distribution . to verify their findings ,",
    "a more complete chemical network and a self - consistent calculation are necessary .",
    "inspired by the seminal work of @xcite , we improve their chemical network and revisit the non - ideal mhd effects on disk formation in this paper , with a particular focus on enhancing ad by truncating very small grains ( vsgs : @xmath010  @xmath1 to few 100  @xmath1 ) off the mrn distribution . the truncation is a simple representation of the actual removal of very small grains in dense cores of molecular clouds .",
    "there is observational evidence for the removal of very small grains in dense cores .",
    "extinction ( optical and near - infrared ) and polarimetric observations of dense molecular clouds indicate that dust grains have larger sizes than those in diffuse interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "recent discovery of `` coreshine '' ( light scattered by large dust grain up to 1  @xmath7 m ; pagani+2010,steinacker+2010 ) from nearby dense cores also implies that grains have grown substantially to larger sizes .",
    "evidence of grain growth has also been collected using multi - wavelength studies @xcite .",
    "two grain growth mechanisms can operate in such cold dense environment : accretion onto grain mantles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and grain coagulation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the latter  grain coagulation  has been shown theoretically to be rather efficient in removing small grains ( < 0.1  @xmath7 m ) from the mrn size distribution within a few 10@xmath9 years @xcite .",
    "such a process may have already finished during the quiescent , slowly - evolving prestellar phase if the cloud is magnetically supported @xcite .",
    "therefore , the exclusion of vsgs from mrn size distribution may in fact be more appropriate for evaluating the magnetic diffusivity in dense cores .",

    "for instance , with @xmath152  s@xmath13 , long - lived rsd of 2030  au can still form when grain size sets to tr - mrn , magnetic field to @xmath128 , and rotation to @xmath153 .",
    "this may provide clues for potentially constraining cosmic - ray ionization rate of dense cores using disk observations .",
    "we will leave the detailed discussion to future studies .",
    "we have implemented an equilibrium chemical network to study the effect of changing grain size on magnetic diffusivities , and coupled the chemistry into 2d axisymmetric mhd simulations to revisit the formation of rsds through non - ideal mhd effects .",
    "our main conclusions are summarized as follows .",
    "\\1 . removing vsgs ( @xmath010  @xmath1 to few 100  @xmath1 ) from the grain size distribution can increase the ambipolar diffusivity by @xmath012 orders of magnitude at densities below 10@xmath2  @xmath3 , because vsgs are both well - coupled to the magnetic field and able to exert strong drag to their surrounding neutral molecules , and the large number of vsgs in the size distribution greatly increase the fluid conductivity and decrease the ambipolar diffusivity .",
    "\\2 . truncating the standard mrn distribution ( while keeping the dust - to - gas mass ratio at 0.01 ) at @xmath154 m ( tr - mrn case ) has the optimal effect on enhancing the ambipolar diffusivity @xmath86 in the low density regime . in this case , both pedersen ( @xmath90 ) and hall ( @xmath91 ) conductivities of the fluid are much smaller than that with the full mrn distribution ; they together raise the @xmath86 by @xmath012 orders of magnitude .",
    "however , the reduction of total grain surface area only increases the ionization fraction by a factor of a few , because the effect scales with @xmath155 and is partially offset by gas - phase ion - electron recombinations .",
    "note that when @xmath45 is set to 1  @xmath7 m , the optimal @xmath44 occurs at @xmath1560.055  @xmath7 m .",
    "pedersen conductivity @xmath90 is normally determined by ions ; however , a large number of vsgs can dominate @xmath90 instead , especially when @xmath44 is between @xmath010  @xmath1 and @xmath0200  @xmath1 ( 0.02  @xmath7 m ) . for the mrn distribution in particular",
    ", the @xmath157 is over 12 orders of magnitude larger than the contribution of ions . for the optimal tr - mrn distribution , the @xmath157",
    "is reduced by @xmath010@xmath139 times and the total @xmath90 by @xmath012 orders of magnitude than those of the mrn case .",
    "hall conductivity @xmath91 is generally dominated by negatively charged grains as long as grain size is below @xmath1460.5  @xmath7 m and above @xmath7110  @xmath1 . by increasing @xmath44 from the mrn case to the tr - mrn case ,",
    "the @xmath91 decreases by up to @xmath0100 times at densities below @xmath010@xmath2  @xmath3 , mainly because of a reduction ( @xmath0500 times ) in the fractional abundance of negatively charged grains @xmath158 and an offsetting effect from the grain s hall parameter @xmath159 .",
    "the low @xmath91 combines with the low @xmath90 in the tr - mrn case together enhances ad in the low density regime .",
    "the enhanced ad by truncated mrn grains can enable massive ( @xmath0few 10@xmath13  m@xmath160 ) long - lived ( > few 10@xmath13910@xmath161  years ) rsds to form in 2d simulations .",
    "the efficient ambipolar diffusion of the magnetic field in the envelope reduces the amount of magnetic flux being dragged in by the collapsing flow , which weakens magnetic braking in the circumstellar region .",
    "therefore , the infalling gas can retain enough angular momentum required for sustaining a large rsd of tens of au .",
    "large gas angular momentum naturally leads to a large centrifugal radius that also determines the disk size .",
    "the centrifugal barrier hosts a hydrodynamic shock as infalling materials slow down and pile up . across the shock , magnetic field geometry changes abruptly from pinched field lines outside the centrifugal radius into straight field lines inside . as a result ,",
    "field lines pile up near the centrifugal radius , field strength amplifies , and magnetic braking becomes the strongest .",
    "however , inside the centrifugal radius where field lines straighten up ( due to lack of infall motion ) , the magnetic braking timescale is much longer than the orbital period , by up to a factor of 10@xmath162 .",
    "magneto - centrifugal outflows are launched at the centrifugal radius ( disk edge ) , which , although are partly affected by the numerical technique , continuously carve the bipolar regions .    \\7 .",
    "faster initial rotation speed and/or weaker initial magnetic field strength further aid the formation of rsds and increase disk size and lifetime , because of an increased amount of angular momentum available in the circumstellar region . in cases with truncated mrn grains and low cosmic - ray ionization rate ,",
    "a large disk ( @xmath7130  au ) forms first and later evolves into a `` compound disk '' that consists of a small keplerian i d and a massive rotationally supported self - gravitating or .",
    "the disk gap that separates the two substructures appears gradually as a result of competition of gravitational force from the origin and that exerted by the massive or , i.e. , gas either falls towards the origin or is pulled backward to the or .",
    ". cosmic - ray ionization rate @xmath163 also plays an important role , besides grain size , on the formation of rsds . in order for the truncated mrn grains to avert the `` magnetic braking catastrophe '' and produce rsds , @xmath163 can not be too high .",
    "we find that @xmath164  s@xmath13 on the corescale can still allow rsds of 2030  au to form in strongly magnetized ( @xmath128 ) cores .",
    "however , @xmath165  s@xmath13 may be too high ; even when other parameters are less stringent , disk radius is at most 1020  au and may further shrink somewhat .",
    "most of the results presented here should still hold in 3d calculations .",
    "the main drawback of 2d axisymmetry is the lack of 3d gravitational and magnetic instabilities , which can redistribute angular momentum inside the disk and drive inward accretion and outward expansion ( to conserve angular momentum ) .",
    "therefore , in 3d , the disk would be less massive ( but larger ) and the star would be more massive than the ones in 2d .",
    "disk fragmentation may also occur in 3d if massive rsds become gravitational unstable @xcite .",
    "hence tight binary and multiple systems with 50  au separation or smaller may form naturally even without tightening wide binaries through magnetic braking @xcite .",
    "magnetic interchange instability in the stellar vicinity has been shown to strongly hinder disk rotation and suppress disk formation , owing to the decoupled magnetic flux from accretion flow that is trapped in the circumstellar region ( dems : decoupling - enabled magnetic structure ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the dems is likely substantially weakened , if not eliminated , by a high ad diffusivity , which makes it difficult for the collapsing flow to drag magnetic flux close to the central object .",
    "although the numerical study here includes both ad and ohmic dissipation , we have also carried out simulations with ad alone for comparison ( not shown ) and find the same results .",
    "the ohmic dissipation has negligible effect on disk formation , at least within the density range and resolution limit of this study .",
    "it is easily explicable from   [ chap.chemresult ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : mhdcoefs ] . in the mrn case , even though ohmic diffusivity dominates over ambipolar diffusivity at high densities ( @xmath7110@xmath27  @xmath3 ) , it has little opportunity to take effect due to a lack of dense long - lived rsd in the first place .",
    "the low ad diffusivity at low densities is simply unable to preserve enough angular momentum to sustain a well defined rsd , if any . in the tr - mrn case ,",
    "ohmic diffusivity is much smaller than ambipolar diffusivity over the entire density range in this study ( even without the cap on the ohmic diffusivity ) , and hence makes little difference to the result .",
    "future studies regarding the subsequent evolution of protoplanetary disk may still consider ohmic dissipation at a much higher density .",
    "we have also explored different slopes of the size distribution than -3.5 and found the corresponding changes on ad diffusivity are much less significant than by removing vsgs .",
    "again , we fix the total grain mass fraction at 0.01 and @xmath166 m .",
    "when the slope is in range ( -4.0 , -3.0 ) , there is only a slight change ( less than a factor of @xmath02 ) to the ad curve .",
    "when the slope is in range ( -3.0 , -2.0 ) , ad diffusivity slightly enhances to the level of @xmath167 m in the -3.5 case , which is still more than 1 order of magnitude lower than that in the optimal @xmath154 m case .",
    "such tests , though very rough , reinforce the pivotal role of removing vsgs on enhancing the ambipolar diffusivity , which is unlikely to be replaced by a reasonable change in the slope of size distribution .",
    "we will leave the detailed analysis in a more refined chemical framework in future study .",
    "although grain coagulation provides natural means of removing vsgs , grain growth to 1  @xmath7 m or larger has been shown to be difficult @xcite in dense cores unless they are relatively long lived .",
    "however , the ad enhancement discussed in this study only require moderate growth of grains .",
    "the optimal cut - off size is just around 0.1  @xmath7 m for @xmath166 m , and around 0.055@xmath168 m for @xmath169 m .",
    "therefore , the removal of vsgs less than few 100  @xmath1 can be efficiently achieved in a few 10@xmath9 years through grain coagulation @xcite .",
    "such a process is also likely to take place during the quiescent prestellar phase which can last for several free - fall times ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "another possible approach to removing vsgs from the collapsing flow is proposed by @xcite ; they suggest that different degrees of grain coupling to the magnetic field can cause small grains to be left behind in the low density envelope , while allow only larger grains to follow the collapse into dense part of the core . in reality",
    ", both mechanisms can operate to help removing vsgs during the prestellar and collapse phase .",
    "more complete chemistry models including advection of gas - phase and grain species as well as grain evolution are needed in non - ideal mhd simulations to obtain a more realistic picture of disk formation in particular and star formation in general .",
    "although much work remains to be done , our calculations have strengthened the case for the non - ideal mhd effects , especially ambipolar diffusion , as a viable mechanism for enabling the formation of rotationally supported disks in even strongly magnetized cloud cores and the growth of such disks to at least tens of aus in size .",
