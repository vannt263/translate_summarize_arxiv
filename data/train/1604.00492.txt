    "excitons are the quanta of the fundamental optical excitations in both insulators and semiconductors in the visible and ultraviolet spectrum of light .",

    "this simple band model assumes that both the valence band and the conduction band are parabolic , isotropic and nondegenerate .",
    "however , in all crystals with zinc - blende and diamond structure the valence band is degenerate at the center of the first brillouin zone  @xcite .",

    "we solve the corresponding schrdinger equation in a complete basis including the coulomb - sturmian functions , which also allows the direct calculation of oscillator strengths from the excitonic wave function and is not limited to certain quantum numbers as in previous works  @xcite . using this method we will reinvestigate the calculations of ref .",

    "concerning its hydrogen - like spectrum up to a principal quantum number of @xmath6  @xcite , the yellow exciton in @xmath4 seems to be a perfect example of a wannier exciton .",
    "however , a more precise investigation of this spectrum shows clear deviations from the simple model with spherical effective masses  @xcite .",
    "these deviations can be explained in terms of the complex valence band structure of @xmath4 .    without spin - orbit coupling the valence band in @xmath4",
    "has the symmetry @xmath8 and is threefold degenerate at the @xmath9-point or the center of the brillouin zone .",
    "this degeneracy can be accounted for by a quasi - spin @xmath10 , since @xmath4 has cubic symmetry , the symmetry of the bands can be assigned by the irreducible representations @xmath11 of the cubic group @xmath12 , where the superscript @xmath13 denotes the parity .",
    "considering the spin - orbit coupling between the quasi - spin @xmath14 and the spin @xmath15 of a hole in the valence band , this sixfold degenerate band ( now including the hole spin ) splits into a lower lying fourfold - degenerate band @xmath16 and a higher lying twofold - degenerate band @xmath17 by an amount of @xmath18 , which is the spin - orbit coupling constant ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : band - structure - of ] ) .",
    "the presence of the nonspherical symmetry of the solid as well as interband interactions cause these bands to be nonparabolic but deformed .    @xcite . due to the spin - orbit coupling ( [ eq : soc ] ) the valence band splits into a lower lying fourfold - degenerate band @xmath16 of and a higher lying twofold - degenerate band @xmath17 .",
    "the lowest lying conduction band has @xmath19 symmetry .",
    "depending on the bands involved , one distinguishes between the yellow , green , blue , and violet exciton series .",
    "[ fig : band - structure - of ] ]    neglecting these effects at first , one arrives at the simple - band model and can distinguish between four exciton series depending on the valence band and the conduction band involved ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : band - structure - of ] ) . within this model",
    "the wave function of an exciton consists of the so - called envelope function , which describes the relative movement of the electron and the hole , and the bloch functions of the bands involved  @xcite .    due to the spins of electron and hole ,",
    "e.g. , the yellow exciton series is fourfold degenerate .",
    "the presence of an exchange interaction between the spins of the electron and the hole lifts this degeneracy and leads to ortho and para excitons  @xcite .",
    "while the threefold degenerate ortho excitons can be observed in absorption spectra , the nondegenerate para excitons are spin - flip - forbidden  @xcite .",
    "going now beyond the simple - band model , the anisotropic dispersion of the valence band has a significant influence on the excitons of the yellow series .",
    "the anisotropic dispersion leads to a coupling between the relative motion of the electron and the hole and the orbital bloch functions @xmath20 ,",
    "@xmath21 , and @xmath22  @xcite of the original @xmath8-band . this will be described mathematically by the so - called @xmath23-term in sec .",
    "[ sub : basis ] .    as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : band - structure - of ] , the yellow exciton series is connected with the @xmath24-valence band . due to symmetry considerations , the amplitudes , which describe the magnitude of the contribution of the orbital bloch functions @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 to this band , must have the same absolute value .",
    "thus , the anisotropy of the @xmath8-bloch functions is compensated in the @xmath24-band .",
    "the same statement now also holds for all nondegenerate exciton states : for reasons of symmetry , the wave function of para excitons contains the orbital bloch functions with amplitudes having the same absolute value .",
    "thus , the dispersion of the para exciton can be described by an isotropic exciton mass .",
    "as regards the threefold degenerate ortho exciton , the situation is different : each of the three exciton states can have a larger contribution of one of the orbital bloch functions , respectively , without a violation of symmetry .",
    "the disparity in the orbital bloch components of the ortho exciton is caused by an admixture of the @xmath25-valence band via the @xmath23-term .",
    "this disparity has then an impact on the relative motion of electron and hole . as a consequence ,",
    "the envelope function of the ortho exciton has no further spherical or cubic symmetry but @xmath26-symmetry .",
    "since @xmath26 is a subgroup of @xmath12 , it contains all symmetry operations , which leave a given @xmath8-component of the ortho exciton invariant .",
    "for instance , in the case of the @xmath20-component the symmetry axis of the according subgroup @xmath26 is the @xmath27-axis of the crystal .",
    "so the reduction of the symmetry of the envelope function reflects the anisotropic dispersion of the orbital bloch functions . due to the @xmath23-term the cubic symmetry @xmath12 holds no",
    "further for the bloch functions and the relative motion separately but only for the combined function .",
    "the lower symmetry of the envelope function allows for a smaller mean distance between electron and hole in a specific direction , which leads to a gain of energy due to the coulomb interaction .",
    "this effect may be compared to the jahn - teller effect , where a reduction of symmetry in connection with degeneracies leads to a gain of energy in the system .    as can be seen",
    ", there is a close connection between degeneracy and symmetry reduction of the envelope function .",
    "this fact explains one of the most striking features of excitonic spectra in @xmath4 : the visibility of @xmath28 and @xmath29 exciton states , i.e. , exciton states with angular momentum @xmath30 and @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "the visibility arises due to the admixture of quadrupole or dipole - allowed @xmath32- and @xmath33-exciton states .    in the following sections  [ sub : hamiltonian ] and  [ sub : basis ] we will now introduce the problem of excitons in @xmath4 from a more mathematical point of view",
