    "ac electrokinetic phenomena , i.e. , electrorotation , dielectrophoresis and traveling wave dielectrophoresis , have gained an increasing amount of attention during the past decade .",
    "this is due to their wide range of applications from cancer research to identifying and separating parasites , cell populations and viruses  @xcite , and even to design of nanomotors  @xcite . despite the number of applications ,",
    "there is a need for a theory that treats the different aspects of electrokinetic phenomena on an equal footing starting from the general underlying physical principles  @xcite .    in this article",
    "we concentrate on electrorotation .",
    "electrorotation ( er ) is a phenomenon in which an interaction between a rotating ac electric field  @xcite and suspended dielectric particles leads to a rotational motion of the particles .",
    "this phenomenon was first observed experimentally over four decades ago  @xcite and during the last two decades , er has been increasingly employed as a sensitive tool for non - invasive studies of a broad variety of microparticles , ranging from living cells to spores , seeds as well as synthetic materials  @xcite .    in electrorotation",
    ", a rotating ac electric field induces a dipole moment inside a polarizable particle which rotates at the angular frequency of the external field . if the frequency of the field increases , the period of the rotating field becomes comparable to the time scale related to the formation of a dipole . to minimize its energy ,",
    "the dipole tries to line up with the field but at high frequencies the particle is no longer able to follow the field .",
    "this leads to a lag in its response and a torque is induced by the interaction of the out - of - phase part of the induced dipole moment and the external field .",
    "the torque and , in turn , the rotating speed are proportional to the imaginary part of the dipole factor ( also called clausius - mossotti factor ) . in addition , the rotating speed of a particle is inversely proportional to the dynamic viscosity , since the particle is suspended in a viscous medium and experiences a dissipative drag force .",
    "different models have been suggested and used for analyzing experimental results , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "the most commonly used ones are the so - called shell models .",
    "this approach was first used by fricke already in 1925  @xcite . a model for a biological cell consisting of a single spherical dielectric shell",
    "was introduced by arnold and zimmermann in 1982 to investigate the rotation of a mesophyll protoplast  @xcite .",
    "four years later , a two - layer model consisting of two spherical shells is put forth to discuss the electrorotation of a single plant cell  @xcite . due to the inhomogeneous compartmentalization of cells ,",
    "three - shell models have been used to investigate er of liposomes  @xcite .",
    "these inhomogeneities can be studied in the framework of graded materials , i.e. , materials with spatial gradients in their structure .",
    "biomaterials such as cells and bones are typical examples as their composition varies through the object .",
    "gradations can also be used to control and improve the strength and other properties , for a recent review see ref .  @xcite . in biological and medical applications identification and separation of graded objects in micron scale ( and below )",
    "is of great importance . in these situations",
    "gradation is generic due to inhomogeneous compartments of cells , the cytoplasm often contains organelles or vacuoles .",
    "these inhomogeneities are reflected in their dielectric properties . since differences and changes in the dielectric properties are intimately related to physical and chemical properties of cells ( as well as other objects ) , electrorotation and other electrokinetic phenomena allow identification of particles and detection of compositional changes .    as far as one decade ago , freyria _ et al .",
    "_ observed a graded cell response when they experimentally study cell - implant interactions  @xcite .",
    "recently , motivated by positional information of protein molecules , honda and mochizuki performed computer simulations of cell pattern formation showing that graded cells can be generated by cell behavior involving differences in intercellular repulsion  @xcite . to discuss such graded cells ,",
    "the above - mentioned multi - shell models fail to apply .",
    "it is thus necessary to develop a new theory to study the effective properties of graded composite materials under externally applied fields . in a recent work  @xcite , we succeeded in deriving the dipole factor after putting forth a differential effective dipole approximation ( deda ) . in this work",
    ", we generalize deda to non - spherical particles and apply it to investigate the er spectrum of graded particles in an attempt to investigate their dielectric behavior .",
    "finally , to demonstrate the validity of our model , we fit our theory to experimental data  @xcite and find good agreement .",
    "we consider an inhomogeneous biological cell or a particle of radius @xmath0 with complex dielectric constant profile @xmath1 , embedded in a host fluid of dielectric constant @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath3 , where @xmath4 denotes real part of the dielectric constant , @xmath5 stands for conductivity , @xmath6 is the frequency of an external field , and @xmath7 .",
    "the dipole factor reflects the polarization of a particle in surrounding medium .    in a recent work  @xcite",
    ", we derived the dipole factor for spherical particles by introducing a differential effective dipole approximation ( deda ) .",
    "the idea of deda can be summarized as follows : consider a shell model for an inhomogeneous particle . in deda one adds new shells of infinitesimal thickness to the particle under consideration .",
    "each of these cells have distance dependent dielectric constant . as the thickness of the layer approaches zero , i.e. , @xmath8 , then the correction to the dipole factor due to it is infinitesimal and one can obtain a differential equation for it",
    " hence the name differential effective dipole approximation .",
    "next we extend deda to the general case of graded spheroidal particles",
    ". then , we study the effect of different conductivity and dielectric profiles to the electrorotation spectrum , and finally compare the theory to experiments .",
    "we first consider a homogeneous dielectric spheroid in a uniform electric field .",
    "the spheroidal inclusion has a dielectric constant @xmath9 and it is embedded in a host medium of dielectric constant @xmath2 .",
    "a spheroidal particle can be parametrized by @xmath10 and the dielectric profile for the graded particle is given by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the aspect ratio and @xmath14 is the length of the semi principle axis along @xmath15  axis .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath16 denotes a prolate spheroid , whereas @xmath17 indicates an oblate one .",
    "we assume that the longest axis of the spheroid is along the @xmath18axis with the depolarization factor @xmath19 , satisfying a sum rule @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the depolarization factor along @xmath22axis .",
    "for a homogeneous spheroid , the dipole factor along @xmath18axis @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 which measures the degree of polarization for a particle in an external field .",
    "next , we add a confocal spheroidal shell of dielectric constant @xmath25 to the spheroidal particle to make a coated spheroid .",
    "then , the dipole factor of the coated spheroid is  @xcite @xmath26 }                   { [ \\te_2+l_z(\\te-\\te_2)]+3x_1\\rho l_z(1-l_z)(\\te-\\te_2 ) } , \\label{b1z}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the volume ratio of the core with respect to the whole spheroid , and @xmath28    this approach can be extended to more shells of different dielectric constants , at the expense of obtaining more complicated expressions .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath29 ( eq .  ( [ b1z ] ) ) reduces to @xmath30 ( eq .  ( [ bz ] ) ) when @xmath31 .",
    "thus , the dipole factor remains unchanged if one adds a spheroidal shell of the same dielectric constant .",
    "next , we consider an inhomogeneous spheroid with the dielectric profile @xmath11 . to establish deda ,",
    "we mimic the graded profile by a multi - shell construction by building up a dielectric profile by gradually adding shells .",
    "we start with an infinitesimal spheroidal core of dielectric constant @xmath32 and continue to add confocal spheroidal shells of dielectric constant @xmath11 until @xmath33 is reached . at @xmath34 , we have an inhomogeneous spheroid . to establish a functional form",
    ", we replace the inhomogeneous spheroid by a homogeneous spheroid of the same dipole factor , and the graded profile is replaced by an effective dielectric constant @xmath35 .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ bz ] ) becomes @xmath36 next , we add a confocal spheroidal shell of infinitesimal thickness @xmath37 , and dielectric constant @xmath11 . the dipole factor will change according to eq.([b1z ] ) .",
    "the effective dielectric constant @xmath38 , being related to @xmath39 , will also change . to see this ,",
    "let us write @xmath40 and take the limit @xmath41 .",
    "we obtain a differential equation : @xmath42\\nonumber\\\\                              & & \\left[\\te_2 l_z(1 + 3b_zl_{1z})+l_{1z}(1 - 3b_zl_z)\\te ( r ) \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 .",
    "the dipole factor of a graded spheroidal particle can be calculated by solving the above differential equation with a given gradation profile @xmath11 .",
    "this nonlinear first - order differential equation can be integrated , at least numerically , if we are given a profile for @xmath44 and an initial condition for @xmath45 .",
    "it is worth noting that the dipole factor is a tensorial quantity and the dipole factor along @xmath22 axis @xmath46 can be obtained by changing @xmath19 to @xmath21 in the equation above .",
    "it is important to note that substituting @xmath47 into this equation yields the deda equation for spherical graded particles  @xcite , @xmath48 \\label{deda } \\\\   \\ , & & \\left[(1 + 2b)\\te_2 + 2(1-b)\\te_1(r ) \\right ] , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 , and @xmath0 is the radius of the spherical particle .",
    "this is the expression we will use in our studies of the effect of conductivity and dielectric profiles on the er spectrum .",
    "the dipole factor of a graded spherical particle can be calculated by solving the above nonlinear first - order differential equation ( eq .  ( [ deda ] ) ) with a given profile @xmath1 and the initial condition b(r=0)=.    if we apply a rotating field to the system , a torque between induced dipole moment inside the cell and the electric field vector will set the cell in a rotational motion .",
    "it is well known that the frequency - dependent rotation speed @xmath50 is proportional to the imaginary part of the dipole factor @xmath51 $ ] .",
    "the rotation speed is given by ( f)=-[b(r = a ) ] , where @xmath52 is the magnitude of the rotating field and @xmath53 the viscosity of the host fluid .",
    "hence , when @xmath54 is solved by integrating eq .",
    "( [ deda ] ) , we can investigate the electrorotation spectrum .    in order to perform numerical calculations",
    ", we take the conductivity and dielectric profiles to be @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are profile dependent constants .",
    "the profile is quite physical in the sense that the conductivity can change rapidly near the boundary of cell and a power - law profile prevails .",
    "the profile constant @xmath56 can take any positive values and it can be larger than unity . from the above equations it is clear that the conductivity is largest at the boundary .",
    "this is the case in real systems as well , since the outermost shell ( e.g. cell wall ) of a cell is always conductive and often has the largest conductivity . on the other hand ,",
    "the dielectric constant may vary only slightly and thus a linear profile suffices .",
    "in particular , the dielectric constant at the center , i.e. , @xmath58 , may be larger than that at the boundary .",
    "thus , we will choose @xmath59 . by integrating the dielectric profile",
    ", we obtain an average dielectric constant @xmath60 for different values of @xmath57 by using a volume average : _",
    "1^av=. [ eave ] for the present dielectric profile , we obtain @xmath61 .",
    "we are now in a position to perform numerical calculations .",
    "we set @xmath62s / m , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 s / m for all of the computations .",
    "parameter @xmath66 denotes the dielectric constant of vacuum . here",
    ", the numerical results and the comparison to experimental data is limited to spherical cells only since we were not able to find appropriate experimental data describing non - spherical cells .",
    "for the numerical computations , we used the fourth - order runge - kutta algorithm with step size @xmath67 to solve the above nonlinear first - order differential equation ( eq .",
    "( [ deda ] ) ) .",
    "it was verified that this step size guarantees accurate numerics .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the er spectrum is investigated for various indices @xmath56 with profile parameters @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath70 and @xmath71 calculated using eq .",
    "( [ eave ] ) , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows that the rotation peak is always present .",
    "it is important to note that the characteristic frequency at which the rotation speed reaches its maximum may be red - shifted , especially at large @xmath56 ( e.g. @xmath72 ) in comparison with small @xmath56 .",
    "thus , the conclusion is that large fluctuations in conductivity of graded particles may lead to a red - shift of the characteristic frequency .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , er spectrum is investigated for @xmath73 and @xmath74 , using various slopes @xmath57 .",
    "we use @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath75 corresponding to @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath76 , respectively . from the figure ,",
    "it is evident that large spatial fluctuations in the dielectric constant may enhance the rotation peak .    from figs .",
    "[ fig1 ]  and  [ fig2 ] , we find that spatial conductivity fluctuations are able to make the characteristic frequency red - shifted and have a clear effect on the rotation peak .",
    "in contrast , spatial dielectric constant fluctuations may enhance the peak value , but their effect on the characteristic frequency is very small . to summarize ,",
    "we can theoretically obtain a typical er spectrum with lower characteristic frequency and high rotation speed by adjusting conductivity and dielectric profiles .",
    "this corresponds to the physical / experimental situation in the case of graded particles .    in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ]  and  [ fig2 ] , the particles under consideration are spherical , i.e. , @xmath47 .",
    "we should remark here that for non - spherical particles , e.g. prolate @xmath77 and oblate spheroids @xmath78 , the same conclusions hold ( no figures shown here ) .",
    "in addition , it is also found that for prolate ( oblate ) graded particles , smaller ( larger ) depolarization factor ( @xmath19 ) can make the characteristic frequency significantly red - shifted .    finally , to demonstrate our theory",
    ", we fit our theory to experimental data in fig .",
    "the data for yeast cells is extracted from the experiments of reichle _ et al . _",
    "@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , from upper panel to lower panel , the symbols denote experimental data of the er spectrum of a yeast cell in water measured at the beginning of the experiment , after 20 minutes , and after 40 minutes , respectively .",
    "the corresponding continuous lines are the fitted result using the present theory .",
    "as discussed earlier , the assumption of homogeneous compartments is not generally justified for biological cells , and the cytoplasm often contains organelles or vacuoles . for this reason",
    ", the experimental data is typically fitted using a ( two-)shell model . to improve fitting using cell models , one would have to adjust six parameters , i.e. , real dielectric constant and conductivity of two shells , as well as cell interior .",
    "in contrast , using on our theory , only two parameters need to be adjusted , namely the profile parameters @xmath57 and @xmath56 .    for all of the three fittings , we set @xmath64 , @xmath79  s / m ( from the experiment ) , @xmath63 , @xmath80  s / m , @xmath81  kv / m ( from experiments ) , @xmath82  kg/(ms ) , and @xmath83 m ( given by experiment ) . for the upper panel , @xmath69 ( namely @xmath84 ) and @xmath85 . for the middle panel , @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) and @xmath88 . for the lower panel , @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) and @xmath91 .    as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , our theory performs very well .",
    "due to the inhomogeneous compartments of a yeast cell , we believe that the graded cell model is a very choice .",
    "in this article , we have generalized the differential effective dipole approximation ( deda ) to non - spherical particles .",
    "this allows studies of shape effects , and indeed colloidal suspensions and many kinds of cells have non - spherical shapes , e.g. red blood cells are oblate spheroids .",
    "in particular , for oblate spheroids larger depolarization factor leads to a red - shift of the characteristic frequency , for prolate spheroids the systems behaves the opposite way  @xcite . to check",
    "the validity of deda , it was compared against exact solutions which can be obtained for a power - law profile  @xcite and a linear profile  @xcite by solving the laplace equation for the local electric field . in both cases deda produced the same results thus showing that it is essentially exact .    in this article , we have applied deda to discuss the electrorotation spectrum of graded colloidal suspension in an attempt to discuss its dielectric behavior . as a result , we find that changes in the conductivity profile can affect both the characteristic frequency ( red - shift ) and rotation peak , whereas changes in the dielectric profile may enhance the rotation peak only .",
    "consequently , we may conclude that the graded behavior does play an important role in the dielectric properties of graded suspensions .",
    "we used our theory ( for spherical cells ) to fit results obtained by reichle _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite for yeast cells and obtained excellent agreement .",
    "it would be interesting to compare this theory to experimental results for non - spherical cells as well , and hopefully new experiments will be performed in that direction .",
    "our work may be extended to discuss the er spectrum of a pair of particles by taking into account the multiple image effect  @xcite and to investigate high concentration suspensions by discussing the local - field effects  @xcite .",
    "a generalization which includes both of these effects is of particular interest .",
    "in addition to er spectrum , our theory may be used to discuss other electrokinetic effects , e.g dielectrophoresis  @xcite and electro - orientation  @xcite .",
