    "<S> these open questions motivate us to develop a more comprehensive theory on tlsm .    </S>",
    "<S> our results are presented in two parts on tlsms without and with soc , respectively . in the first part </S>",
    "<S> , we revisit systems with @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the absence of soc , and find a new class of nodal lines that can only be created and annihilated in pairs , characterized by a new @xmath0 topological invariant . </S>",
    "<S> for a closed surface around the nodal line , we define a new @xmath0 invariant protected by @xmath9 , classifying all nodal lines into two classes , with and without a @xmath0-charge , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> nodal lines with @xmath0 charge can only be created and annihilated in pairs , as the total charge of the bz must be zero . </S>",
    "<S> finite perturbation can make a nodal line with @xmath0 charge shrink to an accidental nodal point , but can not gap it . in the second part , </S>",
    "<S> we discuss systems with @xmath7 , @xmath8 and strong soc . </S>",
    "<S> we show that if there is an additional twofold screw axis , a four - band crossing line , or a double nodal line ( crossing between two doubly degenerate bands ) , can be protected on the boundary of the bz . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first analytic proof of the symmetry protection of a four - band crossing line . </S>",
    "<S> we apply the resultant theory to explain the double nodal line found in earlier model studies@xcite on sriro@xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry we consider is the composition of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , or @xmath9 , an anti - unitary symmetry that preserves the momentum of a single particle . in a system without soc , we have @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12=0 $ ] , which imply @xmath13 </S>",
    "<S> . the action of @xmath9 on the atomic orbitals can hence be represented by complex conjugation ( @xmath14 ) up to a basis choice . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the single particle hamiltonian , @xmath15 , is a real matrix at every @xmath2 in bz . </S>",
    "<S> a real , gapped hamiltonian has @xmath0 topological classification in both one and two dimensions , indicated by the first and the second homotopy groups of the projector onto the occupied bands@xcite _ 1()=_2()=z_2 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the numbers of the unoccupied and the occupied bands ( @xmath18 ) . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath15 is real , at each @xmath2 there is a real representation for all eigenstates of @xmath15 . </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath0 classification of @xmath15 in 1d directly leads to protected nodal points in 2d and nodal lines in 3d , which have been studied in refs . </S>",
    "<S> [ ] . to see this , consider a closed path , i.e. , a loop , in the 3d bz , along which the hamiltonian is gapped . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 invariant for the loop is simply the berry s phase for all occupied bands , quantized to either @xmath22 or @xmath23 , corresponding to the trivial and the nontrivial classes respectively . </S>",
    "<S> if a loop belongs to the nontrivial @xmath0 class , it can not shrink to a point and vanish without crossing a singularity . in 3d bz , this implies a line of singularities threading through the loop [ see fig.[fig:1](a ) ] . given @xmath15 continuous , </S>",
    "<S> each singularity is where the gap closes between the conduction and the valence bands , i.e. , a nodal point , and a line of singularities is hence a nodal line . </S>",
    "<S> given a nodal line in 3d , any loop that interlocks with the nodal line has berry s phase of @xmath23 , while the other loops have zero berry s phase . </S>",
    "<S> thus we conclude that @xmath9 topologically protects a nodal line in 3d in the absence of soc . </S>",
    "<S> unlike the monopole charge of weyl nodes , the 1d @xmath0 invariant does not forbid a single nodal line from being annihilated or created locally in @xmath1-space in 3d . consider the following two band model as example [ eq : model1 ] h(k)=(m - k^2)_x+k_z_z . </S>",

    "<S> consider a sphere divided by an equator into two halves , say the northern and the southern hemispheres . </S>",
    "<S> the wavefunctions on each hemisphere , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , can be real and smooth because each hemisphere is contractible . at each point on the equator , denoted by the azimuthal angle @xmath30 , where the two hemispheres meet , the projectors to the occupied space must be equal _ n|u^n_n(,)^n_n(,)|=_n|u^s_n(,)^s_n(,)| , because the hamiltonian is smooth on the whole sphere . </S>",

    "<S> the new @xmath0 invariant classifies nodal lines in 3d systems with @xmath9 into two classes : with and without a @xmath0 charge . </S>",
    "<S> a nodal line with a @xmath0 charge can be considered a @xmath0 monopole , which can only be created or annihilated in pairs . </S>",
    "<S> this is easy to prove by contradiction : if a @xmath0 monopole is created ( annihilated ) locally in @xmath1-space , the wavefunctions sufficiently away from this point are changed by a small amount , so the @xmath0 invariant on a surface far away from the point is unchanged , contradicting the assumption that a @xmath0 monopole is created ( annihilated ) within .    for concreteness </S>",
    "<S> , we construct a 3d hamiltonian around such a @xmath0 monopole [ eq : model2 ] h(k)=q_xs_x+q_y_ys_y+q_zs_z+m_xs_x , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are pauli matrices acting on two isospin degrees of freedom and @xmath35 is the momentum relative to the origin of the @xmath36 expansion . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum is given by e(k)=. the band crossing can be found by solving @xmath37 , yielding @xmath24 and @xmath38 , i.e. , a nodal line on the @xmath39-plane of radius @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath27 changes from positive to negative , the radius decreases and shrinks to zero at @xmath41 but increases again when @xmath27 becomes negative [ see fig.[fig:1](d ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> an explicit calculation of the @xmath0 charge of this nodal line is given in appendix [ apn : model2 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that the su(2 ) rotation plays an important role in protecting a line node . </S>",
    "<S> when su(2 ) is broken , or there is soc , the composition of inversion and time - reversal ensures double degeneracy at each @xmath2 in bz . any crossing point between two doublet bands </S>",
