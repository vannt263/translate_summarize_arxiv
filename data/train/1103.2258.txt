    "the scale invariance of the perturbations growth in the matter dominated epoch is known as the result of both the newtonian and einstein gravity theories .",
    "it is caused by the absence of the euler term in the propagation equations  .",
    "partial differential equations derived as the first order expansion of einstein equations , immediately reduce to ordinary ones . according to standard procedures the initial conditions for these equations are being imposed at the beginning of the matter dominated epoch .",
    "initial velocity field is set to zero throughout the space , or alternatively , the decaying mode is neglected  .",
    "the perturbation then is the product of time - dependent factor and an arbitrary function of the space coordinates .",
    "perturbations of any shape and any scale grow equally slow    too slow to form compact objects in the time interval admitted by observations  @xcite .    similar constraints for initial conditions are often applied to the @xmath2-body simulations  . following  @xcite",
    "numerous treatments additionally adopt the zeldovich approximation  @xcite or its generalizations  .",
    "the perturbations statistics and amplitudes are confronted with the cmb data and inflationary scenarios  .",
    "most approaches adopt newtonian gravity or the newtonian limit of gr .",
    "the @xmath2-body simulations are promissory in non - linear regime .",
    "the question how to reach nonlinear regime still remains difficult for both simulations and analytical solutions .    in this paper",
    "we investigate initial condition which are simultaneously consistent with the perturbation equations in both , the radiation- and mater - dominated epochs .",
    "following the techniques elaborated in the gravitational waves theory  , we treat both epochs ( with the perturbation corrections included ) as the single riemannian manifold .",
    "appropriate junction conditions guarantee that the first and the second fundamental forms at the decoupling hypersurface @xmath3 are continuos .",
    "the perturbation modes are unique and regular in the entire spacetime .",
    "the momentum spectrum of sound in the radiation - dominated epoch ( the gauge - invariant and time - independent fourier coefficients @xmath4 ) uniquely determine the perturbations evolution , both prior and past to decoupling . due to junction conditions the perturbations in the late epoch ( @xmath5 ) inherit some properties from the epochs before decoupling .",
    "one of the symptoms is the breakdown of the late - time scale - invariance .",
    "einstein equations and darmois  israel conditions provide solution for the background scale factor @xmath6 @xmath7 stands for the time of decoupling , @xmath8 is a constant of motion , @xmath9 in the radiation filled universe . in the conformal newtonian gauge with the metric tensor @xmath10 the propagation equations for the density perturbations in both epochs take forms @xmath11 -\\frac{1}{3}\\nabla_{\\mu}\\nabla^{\\mu}\\pjez=0 ,      \\label{eq : pertrad }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the radiation - dominated epoch , and @xmath12=0 .",
