    "an increase of the spin splitting at fixed @xmath36 and @xmath17 leads to the decrease of @xmath60 therefore the number of backscattered particles decreases .",
    "the coherent backscattering is also pronounced in the @xmath227 pseudospin component . in this case",

    "to summarize , we have studied in detail the spin - dependent quantum interference and classical multiple scattering effects in dynamics of exciton - polaritons .",
    "we have derived the quantum corrections to the collision integral of exciton - polaritons in the leading order in @xmath243 .",
    "the quantum corrections are strongly sensitive to the value of the spin splitting of exciton - polaritons .",

    "the quantum correction to spin @xmath0-component diffusion coefficient changes its sign from negative to positive with the increase of the spin splitting while the correction to the diffusion coefficient of the in - plane spin components is negative .",
    "the relaxation of the longitudingal spin component is accelerated by the quantum interference effects and the relaxation rate of the transverse spin components can increase or decrease depending on the spin splitting value .",
    "the polarization conversion efficiency in the regime of the optical spin hall effect can also be larger or smaller than the value predicted by the classical theory depending on the relations between the lifetime of polaritons , their scattering time and the value of the spin splitting ."
