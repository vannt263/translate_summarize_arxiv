    "since most indirect effects of new physics first enter at the loop level , they are often dominated by tree level standard model ( sm ) contributions .",
    "it is for this reason that only now , with the advent of precision electroweak measurements , we are beginning to probe the structure of new physics .",
    "however an exception to this approach is the process @xmath4 . since this flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc )",
    "process first occurs at loop level in the sm , we have an interesting case where the effects of new physics may be comparable to the sm contribution .    on the experimental side , cleo has recently announced a measurement of the inclusive decay rate @xcite @xmath5 where the final two errors are both systematic in nature .",
    "this translates into @xmath6 at the 95% confidence level . while there are still substantial theoretical uncertainties in the sm prediction for @xmath1 ( mostly related to unknown next leading order qcd corrections @xcite ) , this experimental value agrees well with a standard model prediction of @xmath7 with a top quark mass @xmath8  gev @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of this fcnc process to new physics thus allows us to put limits on many theories of physics beyond the sm @xcite . in this paper",
    "we examine the implications of the @xmath1 penguin on the 3 - 3 - 1 model @xcite .",
    "this model , based on the gauge group @xmath9 , gives a potential answer to the question of flavor by predicting three families as a consequence of anomaly cancellation .",
    "this is accomplished by making one of the three quark families transform differently from the other two under the @xmath10 extended electroweak gauge group .",
    "hence this model suffers generically from large fcncs @xcite , leading to a possible large enhancement of the @xmath1 decay rate .",
    "while the 3 - 3 - 1 model predicts no new leptons , it predicts one new quark per family , denoted here by @xmath11 and @xmath12 with charge @xmath13 and @xmath14 with charge @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "these quarks interact with the ordinary quarks via the charged dilepton gauge boson doublet , @xmath16 .",
    "in addition , there is a neutral @xmath17 gauge boson with flavor changing couplings to the usual quarks .",
    "thus there are new processes contributing to @xmath1 incorporating @xmath18new quark loops as well as flavor changing @xmath17 loops .",
    "although many higgs multiplets are necessary in order to break the 3 - 3 - 1 gauge symmetry , we show that it is only necessary to look at an effective two - higgs - doublet model .",
    "an unusual feature of the 3 - 3 - 1 model are the strong bounds placed on the masses of the new particles .",
    "of present interest is the bound @xmath19  gev @xcite which indicates that the 3 - 3 - 1 contributions to @xmath1 may not be suppressed by simply increasing the 3 - 3 - 1 scale , @xmath20 .    as is well known , qcd corrections lead to an important enhancement of the @xmath1 decay rate in the sm .",
    "thus , when examining the additional contribution from the 3 - 3 - 1 model , we divide the calculation into two parts . in section 2",
    ", we calculate the new electroweak penguin diagrams associated with the 3 - 3 - 1 model , and in section 3 , we examine the effects of qcd running from the 3 - 3 - 1 scale to @xmath21-quark scale . in section 4",
    "we combine the results of the previous sections and examine the implications of the current cleo bound on the 3 - 3 - 1 model .",
    "finally we present our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "although the 3 - 3 - 1 model contains tree level fcnc interactions mediated by @xmath17 exchange , the decay @xmath1 remains a loop process in this model .",
    "thus we expect the additional 3 - 3 - 1 contributions to @xmath1 to be at most comparable to the sm penguin diagram .",
    "these new 3 - 3 - 1 contributions arise from dilepton gauge boson @xmath18 , @xmath17 and charged higgs loops . at one - electroweak - loop order ,",
    "all these contributions add linearly to the @xmath1 amplitude .",
    "hence we consider them one at a time .    in the gauge sector",
    "all lowest order contributions to @xmath1 are given by the penguin diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] where @xmath22 , @xmath18 or @xmath17 .",
    "since all charged gauge bosons contribute similarly , we first calculate the effective @xmath1 vertex for an arbitrary left handed gauge boson loop and subsequently specialize to @xmath23 or @xmath18 loops .",
    "the @xmath17 contribution is calculated separately since it involves flavor changing vertices .    for a left handed gauge boson @xmath24 , the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] give rise to an effective vertex @xmath25\\gamma_lb , \\label{eq : veff}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the momentum carried by the photon .",
    "while gauge invariance of the photon demands a vanishing @xmath27 , we will see that this arises in a subtle manner in the 3 - 3 - 1 model .",
    "we work in feynman gauge and ignore the light quark masses .",

    "on the other hand , the second line in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : yloop ] ) is present because the third family couples differently .",
    "this is already well known for the tree level @xmath17 couplings .",
    "however we see here that generation non - universality also appears in dilepton loop diagrams .",
    "we note that this imperfect gim cancellation has a couple of consequences .",
    "first of all , unlike the sm , the dilepton induced @xmath1 penguin in the 3 - 3 - 1 model may be non - vanishing even when all exotic quarks are degenerate in mass .",
    "this is simply another manifestation of potentially large fcncs in the 3 - 3 - 1 model .",
    "secondly , we may worry about the divergent gauge non - invariant term @xmath27 of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : nab ] ) .",
    "because the gim sum involves the gauge bosons @xmath54 and @xmath55 , we find a left over divergent term of the form @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "this , however , is cancelled by the @xmath17 fcnc vertex induced by @xmath57@xmath17 mixing as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] @xcite .",
    "since this diagram does not contribute to the dipole form factor , its only purpose for the present discussion is to eliminate the unwanted @xmath27 , and can otherwise be ignored .",
    "finally , the diagrams with a @xmath17 in the loop also contribute to @xmath58 due to the flavor changing @xmath17 couplings . in this neutral current case ,",
    "since the quark in the loop is light , we ignore its mass and find @xmath59 where @xmath60 arises from the @xmath17 coupling to quarks @xcite . in principle , this introduces yet another scale into the problem , namely @xmath61 .",

    "however , as a simplification we ignore the difference between the two 3 - 3 - 1 scales since the qcd running effects are less pronounced at higher energies . in this case",

    "the generalized gim cancellation is imperfect and @xmath170 is non - vanishing even for degenerate exotic quark masses . compared to the two - higgs - doublet model where @xmath2  gev , this limit is weakened to @xmath3  gev in the full 3 - 3 - 1 model .",
    "although the 3 - 3 - 1 model appears tightly constrained both by fcnc limits and by the large @xmath171 coupling @xcite , the model survives the test of @xmath1 , at least up to the current level of precision .",
    "as experimental evidence for a heavy top continues to build , the curious feature of a different third generation in the 3 - 3 - 1 model takes on more significance .",
    "hence we look forward with anticipation to what future experiments in the @xmath172 system will bring .",
