    "@xcite studied counterintuitive forces which arise between a black body and neutral atoms or molecules - named black body force ( bbf ) - due to the energy associated with shifts in the absorption lines of their spectra .",
    "these shifts are induced by the so - called dynamical stark effect , in which the incoherent electromagnetic waves generated from the heated black body surface disturbs the electronic transitions in the atomic spectrum .    in the above mentioned article ,",
    "the authors have found that attractive forces undoubtedly arise from shifts in the electronic transitions involving the @xmath0 level of the hydrogen atom , and such forces would eventually be stronger than the repulsive force caused by the radiation pressure and the gravitational force due to the black body mass .",
    "however , the energy associated to the spectral shift induced in other atom species could be positive , leading to repulsive forces . in the microscopic level",
    ", this effect can arise from other incoherent electromagnetic emissions , strongly dependent on the shape of the emitting surface .",
    "it is also noticeable in @xcite the emphasis put on the connection between the geometry of the bodies and the bbf , but the authors did not investigate the possible influences of both the topology and spacetime geometry on that force . in other words , those authors limited themselves to flat geometry with trivial topology .",
    "astrophysical and cosmological scenarios as well as some models in condensed matter physics offer possible investigation lines for the bbf .",
    "however , corrections to that force are necessary because even in a weak - field regime , in standard or alternative theories of gravitation , there are non - negligible modifications in the black body radiation law caused by the gravity @xcite , which must be taken into account for a complete understanding of the phenomena .",
    "this is another sense in which geometry is fundamental in understanding of the bbf .",
    "it is worth noticing that the authors of ref.@xcite show that the bbf depends on both the temperature and the solid angle , which are modified by the spacetime geometry .",
    "therefore this work focus on the effects due to both the spacetime geometry and topology on the bbf .",
    "this is considered for static and spherical gravitational sources as well as for infinitely long cylinders , including those ones like cosmic strings .",
    "we compute these force corrections and study their behavior comparing them with the flat case , obtained in @xcite . in the case of the spherical symmetry we will particularize for the schwarzschild solution , making equally manifest the role of the local spacetime geometry in the intensity of the bbf .",
    "we will numerically calculate this corrected force regarding typical neutron stars and the sun .    regarding the cylindrical geometry ,",
    "whose bbf is initially calculated for the infinitely long newtonian cylinder , an angular ( deficit ) parameter @xmath1 is appropriately introduced in order to investigate effects of the spacetime topology on that force .",
    "such a parameter multiplies the azimuthal angle entering in the calculation of the solid angle subtended by the atom , and it characterizes the global properties of the cosmic string spacetime , which presents a locally flat geometry , but with global curvature .",
    "this feature generates interesting effects , as self - interaction on particles and dipoles @xcite and gravitational lens @xcite .",
    "in addition , we also consider the bbf caused by a cosmic string rotating stationarily around its symmetry axis , where effects due to the spacetime rotation are expected .",
    "the cosmic string spacetime has a non - trivial topology which is encoded in the aforementioned angular parameter given by @xmath2 @xcite , where @xmath3 is the newtonian constant of gravity and @xmath4 is the linear mass density of the string .",
    "the more recent observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) provide an upper bound on dimensionless parameter @xmath5 of the order of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "it is worth emphasize that cosmic strings can have played an important role in the primitive universe , and it is known that in its very early ages the temperature was extremely hot @xcite ; thus it is natural thinking that those objects were in constant interaction with the thermal radiation that bathed the universe .",
    "indeed , the effects of the thermal equilibrium of cosmic strings with radiation were analyzed in @xcite .",
    "although cosmic strings are still subjects of theoretical speculation , a concrete realization of them occurs in some condensed matter systems .",
    "the static cosmic strings are emulated as topological defects termed disclinations , which lie within crystalline structures , including liquid crystals in the nematic phase [ 8,9 ] , while the avatars of the stationary cosmic strings are vortices in a superfluid [ 10,11 ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we analyze the bbf on a neutral atom due to the radiation emitted by spherical sources , studying changes in this force due to the gravitational field . in section 3",
    ", we consider cylindrical sources in the calculation of that force , revealing the role of both the topology and spacetime rotation in the production of it and , finally , in section 4 we discuss the results .",
    "units in which @xmath7 is taken in all calculations .",
    "in this section we examine the influence of spacetime geometry on the bbf . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , for the non - relativistic case , the attractive potential associated to this force exerted on the neutral hydrogen atom in its fundamental state , placed at a distance @xmath8 from the center of a spherical black body of radius @xmath9 at temperature @xmath10 is , in natural units , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the fine structure constant , @xmath13 is the mass of the electron , and @xmath14 is the solid angle subtended by the atom .",
    "about the above expression some points are worth comment . as pointed in ref .",
    "@xcite , for the hydrogen atom in an isotropic thermal bath , the dynamical stark effect will mostly cause a negative energy shift for the ground state .",
    "if the temperature of the thermal bath is @xmath10 , this shift is given by @xmath15    since the atom is in an isotropic thermal bath , the black body field can not have any directional effect on the atom motion , inducing only friction and diffusion .",
    "those authors then argue that if a finite source is considered , this produces a net force .",
    "the point is that in this case , the atom does not see radiation coming from all directions , but only from a solid angle determined by the source .",
    "therefore , only a fraction of the energy shift in the isotropic bath would cause the bbf .",
    "this fraction is given by the solid angle compared to @xmath16 , giving us the final potential energy of eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) . for the non - relativistic spherically symmetric case",
    "this solid angle is given by @xmath17    from the above expression we can see that the radial dependence of the potential comes only from the solid angle .",
    "however , when we consider curved static spacetimes , the effective temperature will also depend on the coordinates via tolman temperature @xcite . therefore , in order to find corrections to the bbf two aspects must be considered : the first is the curvature correction to the temperature and the second is the modification in the solid angle determined by the spacetime curvature .",
    "this is the general procedure that we will follow throughout this manuscript .",
    "now we must consider the specific case with spherical symmetry .",
    "the cases in which global or topological properties are relevant will be left to the next section , where cylindrical symmetries play an important role .",
    "the static and spherically symmetric exterior solution of einstein s equation of general relativity is considered , which is given by the metric @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath9 is the radius of the source as seem from infinity .",
    "the interior solution is also important to determine the solid angle as seem by the atom . for this",
    "we use the schwarzschild one which is given by @xmath20    as said above , the spacetime modification to the temperature is given by the tolman temperature . at the position of the atom",
    "this is given by @xmath21 where @xmath10 is the temperature of the isotropic thermal bath , as measured by an observer at the infinity .",
    "the fact that the temperature depends on the radial coordinate will contribute to modify the bbf .",
    "now we must consider the modification in the solid angle due to the spacetime curvature which occurs in the system investigated here .",
    "two corrections in expression ( [ solido ] ) must be considered , since the size of the source and the distance of the atom to its center are modified by gravity .",
    "these two quantities are calculated via @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the effective distance of the atom to the source center and the first integral in the rhs is its effective radius @xmath24 .",
    "this latter can be obtained by using eq .",
    "( [ metric < ] ) and is given by    @xmath25    and the second integral is @xmath26    thus we obtain that the modification in the solid angle will be given by @xmath27 notice that the above expression reproduces the euclidean solid angle for large values of @xmath8 and at the surface of the source is given by @xmath28 .",
    "plugging eq .",
    "( [ teff ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ solidomodificado ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) we get the final corrected expression for the potential @xmath29 this potential corresponds to a force that also drops with the cube - inverse at large distances and is infinity when @xmath30 , as in the flat spacetime case .    ,",
    "gravitationally corrected and flat , both as functions of the radial coordinate.,width=321 ]    in fig . 1",
    ", we depict the graph of the relativistically corrected potential @xmath31 over the temperature function @xmath32 , against the same potential energy in the flat case , both depending on the radius @xmath8 , for a compact sphere with @xmath33 .",
    "the difference between both is sensible , and the magnitude of the corrected one is considerably greater than the observed in the other case . at @xmath34 ,",
    "the corrected potential is approximately 14% lower than the flat case . at smaller distances ,",
    "the difference increases even more .",
    "the calculation of the bbf itself is made by performing @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "notice that by considering the sun , this reduction in the temperature - independent part of the bbf potential is approximately 0.001% at @xmath34 . for a quantum gravity correction to this force ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "in this section we will consider the bbf caused by systems with cylindrical symmetries .",
    "there are three cases to be considered here .",
    "one is the non - relativistic radiating infinity cylinder , which was not considered in the original ref .",
    "the other two cases consider the influence of the spacetime generated by both static and stationary cosmic strings , with and without thickness .      from the expression without gravity ( [ potential ] ) , the only change in the potential will be due to the solid angle . supposing that the particle is at a distance @xmath36 of the rectangle center , thus the solid angle of the whole cylinder subtended by the atom is given by @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 ; @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the length and width of the rectangle , respectively .",
    "taking an infinitely long cylinder , @xmath42 , and writing the width in terms of the cylinder radius , @xmath9 , and of the distance of the particle from the cylinder symmetry axis , @xmath8 , which coincides with the @xmath43 axis , we have @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "the argument @xmath46 is just the half - angle measured from the atom and which embraces the cylinder in the plane @xmath47 . in the fig .",
    "1 we depict the neutral atom ( a ) close to the cylindrical black body . according to it ,",
    "the geometrical elements present in our analysis are : @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "we find that the attractive potential on the hydrogen atom in the ground state due to the cylindrical black body at absolute temperature @xmath10 is given by @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the thermal shift in the absorption lines of the spectrum of the unexcited hydrogen atom .",
    "thus the magnitude of the radial force exerted on this atom is given by @xmath55 where @xmath12 is now the fine - structure constant .",
    "notice that the bbf is attractive , falling with a square - inverse law at large distances ( or @xmath56 ) . that is different from what happens in the spherical black - bodies where the force drops with the cubic - inverse law at those distances @xcite .",
    "the fact that the cosmic strings spacetime have a locally flat geometry but a non - trivial topology raises interesting points .",
    "first of all , due to the local flatness , the effective temperature is not changed and therefore the only possible correction comes from the solid angle like in the previous case .",
    "the interesting point is that the solid angle now depends on the deficit angular parameter @xmath1 , incorporating then topological features in the bbf .",
    "let us model a static cosmic string , or its realization as a disclination in a liquid crystal , by the cylinder above considered .",
    "first , the conical geometry of the space around of the defect has to be incorporated .",
    "such a geometry is described through the metric @xmath57 this expression describes the space around an ideal cosmic string of zero thickness , or the exterior region of that one endowed with an internal structure @xcite . for this defect , @xmath58 ( angular deficit parameter ) , and @xmath59 . for a disclination , @xmath1 can also be between zero and one , meaning that we have an angular excess parameter .",
    "then all we have to do is rewrite the half - angle from which the atom sees the cylinder , @xmath60 , in terms of the correspondent half central ( azimuthal ) angle , @xmath61 , such that @xmath62 and to insert the factor @xmath63 which multiplies the azimuthal angles , according to the metric ( [ 05 ] ) .",
    "thus the expression ( [ potentialnrc ] ) becomes @xmath64}}}},\\ ] ] and calculating the force via @xmath65 , we get @xmath66 it is worth notice that , for the neutral hydrogen atom in the minkowsky space ( _ i.e. _ , when @xmath67 ) we have the expression ( [ 04 ] ) again , and when one takes the limit @xmath68 valid for an ideal cosmic string , the bbf vanishes .",
    "then , an important conclusion is that ideal cosmic strings irradiating do not exert bbfs .    for non - zero thickness and @xmath69",
    ", we can approximate eq .",
    "( [ fnu ] ) by @xmath70 the force is attractive , due to the factor @xmath71 to be negative for neutral hydrogen atoms , and it still falls off with the inverse square of the radial distance . such a law is the same one that manages the self - force on neutral ( or charged ) massive particles situated in the spacetime of a gott - hiscock cosmic string , when the particle is far away from the string @xcite .",
    "let us now analyze the bbf on a neutral atom due to a spinning cosmic string , which is the stationary counterpart of the static cosmic string . as seen in the introduction ,",
    "these objects appear in condensed matter physics as vortices in superfluids .",
    "the correspondent spacetime metric is given by @xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the angular momentum per unit length of the string , such that when it vanishes , we recover eq .",
    "( [ 05 ] ) .",
    "from the above expression we can see that the effective angular deficit parameter is given by @xmath74 notice that this provides a consistent definition since it recover the static case for large @xmath8 .",
    "the bbf on the neutral atom , when one modifies @xmath75 in eq .",
    "( [ vnu ] ) is given by @xmath76 where @xmath77 .",
    "we call attention to the fact that the force now is non - zero when the string radius vanishes , yielding @xmath78 while the string is spinning . for a neutral hydrogen atom very distant from the string",
    ", the attractive bbf now falls off with the inverse cube of its radial distance , @xmath79 , and diverges at @xmath80 , _",
    "i.e. _ , at the neighborhood of the boundary that defines the region of the closed time - like curves ( ctc s ) @xcite . in the interior of that region , @xmath81 ,",
    "the bbf is not defined .",
    "strictly speaking , the solid angle given in eq .",
    "( [ cylindersolidangle ] ) is valid only for flat spaces .",
    "however , the modification that must occur in a curved space was effectively implemented in the above systems through the azimuthal angle , since this latter is the only geometric parameter that is changed in fact , as we can see in the metrics ( 23 ) and ( 28 ) , altering solely the global properties of these space - times , which remain locally flat .",
    "we have studied the effects of the black body radiation produced by spherical and cylindrical sources on a nearby neutral hydrogen atom in the ground state , which suffers , via dynamical stark effect , a shift in its spectrum absorption lines producing a attractive force ( bbf ) .",
    "this was made by analyzing geometrical and topological influences of their respective space - times on it .",
    "initially , we have calculated the effects due to a static and spherically symmetric gravitational background , starting by taking the tolman temperature and substituting it in bbf general expression , yielding a first correction to it . in order to arrive at the full correction , we taken also into account modifications in the solid angle subtended by the atom due to the curvature of the spacetime . to do this , we considered the radial proper distance to the center of the source , which was computed from both the exterior and interior schwarzschild solutions . when the results found here are applied to a compact object with this parameter measuring ten times the correspondent schwarzschild radius ,",
    "the bbf potential gravitationally corrected is _ circa _ 14% lower than the flat case at @xmath34 . for the sun",
    ", we verified that the einstein s gravity reduces the bbf potential about 0.001 per cent in relation to this quantity when calculated in the flat spacetime at the same distance , which is therefore a very tiny difference when compared to the previous case .",
    "the analysis continued by taking into account the radiation emitted from an infinitely long cylinder with a diameter equal to @xmath82 , and calculated the attractive potential on the hydrogen atom related to that effect , taking into account just the source s shape . in this case , the bbf is attractive , falling with a square - inverse law at large distances , differently of that happens with spherical black - bodies , in which the force obeys the inverse cube law at those distances as shown in @xcite .",
    "we must point out , as awaited , that the proper body geometry plays a central role in the bbf .",
    "next , we have appropriately introduced the angular parameter @xmath1 in the expression correspondent to the attractive potential due to the cylindric black body radiation .",
    "this parameter multiplies the azimuthal ( or central ) angle which enters in the calculation of the solid angle subtended by the atom , characterizing the conical geometry of the cosmic string ( or of its realization as a disclination in a crystal ) spacetime , and , thus , its topological properties .",
    "the bbf vanishes when we consider an ideal static cosmic string , in which @xmath83 , but it is non - zero when we taken into account an ideal spinning cosmic string ( or vortices in superfluids ) , now falling off at large distances according to an inverse cube law , as in the spherical case .",
    "we can conclude that such a force is weaker than that one presented in the static case because the non - inertial effects caused by the spacetime rotation itself , or , in other words , by the frame dragging associated with stationary cosmic strings @xcite .",
    "we have also shown that this force is not defined in the interior of the ctc s domain , diverging at its boundary .",
