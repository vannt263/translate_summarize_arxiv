    "<S> using the self - consistent born approximation we calculate reiter s wavefunction for a single hole introduced into the undoped and orbitally ordered ground state of the @xmath0@xmath1 model with @xmath2 orbital degrees of freedom . while the number of excitations is similar to the spin @xmath0-@xmath1 model for a given @xmath3 , a distinct structure of the calculated wavefunction and its momentum dependence </S>",

    "<S> introduction _ recently , using self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) , we showed that a single hole introduced into the undoped ground state of an orbital @xmath0@xmath1 model with @xmath2 orbital degeneracy propagates coherently as a quasiparticle @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this striking result contradicts the nave expectations which suggest that a hole should be trapped in this ising - like ordered ground state . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the motion of a single hole is due to the frequently neglected three - site terms and we showed @xcite that this new mechanism of hole movement is fundamentally different from the coherent hole motion via quantum fluctuations in the standard spin @xmath0@xmath1 model @xcite , or in the case of @xmath4 orbitals @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> though , a more detailed understanding of this novel mechanism is needed . </S>",
    "<S> hence , instead of considering the green s function of the problem @xcite , we investigate the corresponding reiter s wavefunction @xcite calculated in the scba .    _ </S>",
    "<S> orbital polarons _ the orbital @xmath0@xmath1 hamiltonian , relevant for ferromagnetic @xmath5 planes with two active @xmath2 orbitals , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , at each site , consists of three terms @xcite @xmath8 , with    [ eq : h_tj2 ] @xmath9    where a tilde above fermion operators denote the restricted hilbert space without double occupancies , the total on - site density @xmath10 , and the pseudospin operators @xmath11 . in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : h3s ] ) we neglected the three - site terms which require orbital excitation and therefore do not change the physical properties of the system in the low doping regime ( cf . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite ) .    following ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we reduce the @xmath0@xmath1 model to a polaronic problem , which is a physically justified procedure for the af or ao ordered phases with low concentration of added holes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we : ( i ) divide the square lattice into two sublattices @xmath12 and @xmath13 , ( ii ) rotate pseudospins on the @xmath12 sublattice , and ( iii ) introduce fermion operators @xmath14 and hard - core boson operators @xmath15 such that @xmath16 and @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> then , in the linear spin - wave approximation and having only one doped hole in the plane , we obtain the following fourier - transformed polaronic hamiltonian , @xmath18 , with    [ ht2g_pol ] @xmath19\\ ! , \\\\ \\label{hj_pol } h_{j}\\!=&\\ ; \\omega_0 \\sum_{\\bf k } \\left ( \\alpha_{{\\bf k } a}^\\dag \\alpha^{}_{{\\bf k } a } + \\alpha_{{\\bf k } b}^\\dag \\alpha_{{\\bf k } b}^ { } \\right),\\\\ \\label{h3s_pol } h_{\\rm 3s}\\!=&\\ ; \\sum_{\\bf k } \\left [ \\varepsilon_y ( { \\bf k } ) h_{{\\bf k } a}^\\dag h_{{\\bf k } a}^ { } \\!+\\ ! \\varepsilon_x ( { \\bf k } ) h_{{\\bf k } b}^\\dag h_{{\\bf k } b}^ { } \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here the sums go over all momenta @xmath20 in the brillouin zone for the whole lattice everywhere before summations . ] , the total number of sites is @xmath21 , and the orbiton energy is @xmath22 .    the vertices and the dispersion relations are equal to ( with @xmath23 ) : @xmath24    _ reiter s wavefunction _ in the spirit of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , let us assume that the wavefunction for a hole with quasiparticle ( qp ) momentum @xmath25 and initially doped into the sublattice @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , takes the form :    @xmath26    the coefficients @xmath27 ( with the sublattice index @xmath28 ) are the qp spectral weights which follow from the normalization of the wavefunction , whereas @xmath29 for @xmath30 are to be determined from the schrdinger equations @xmath31 . substituting eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : ansatza])([eq : ansatzb ] ) into them yields    [ eq : coeff ] @xmath32    where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the green s functions @xmath36 are defined by the self - consistent equations    [ eq : green ] @xmath37    and the qp energy has to be equal    [ eq : qpenergy ] @xmath38    note , that in order to obtain equations for the coefficients of the reiter s wavefunction @xmath39 eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : coeff ] ) we adopted the following contraction procedure : we neglected all terms which would correspond to the annihilation of orbitons in the @xmath40-th step if the orbitons were created earlier than in the @xmath41-th step . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure resembles the non - crossing approximation while calculating green s function using the diagrammatic technique . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , one may wonder why we still have to adopt such approximation since the closed loops which correspond to the crossing diagrams are anyway prohibited in the orbital @xmath0@xmath1 model under consideration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the answer to this puzzle is the following : to conclude that the crossing diagrams are unphysical we not only need to look at the structure of the hamiltonian eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ht2g_pol ] ) but also at the processes allowed by this hamiltonian on the square lattice . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we need some extra information about the lattice to exclude the crossing diagrams , and consequently we need to introduce the contraction procedure by hand .    _ consequences _ eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : coeff ] ) together with eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : green ] ) and ( [ eq : qpenergy ] ) can be easily solved numerically . </S>",
    "<S> while it is impossible to calculate the coefficients @xmath39 for all @xmath40 , one may ask whether there exists such an @xmath42 that all the coefficients with @xmath43 are so small that they could be safely neglected . </S>",
    "<S> this question is also of physical importance since knowing @xmath42 would mean that the wavefunction of the doped hole can be approximated by a superposition of the wavefunction of a free hole and @xmath42 wavefunctions of the hole dressed with @xmath42 orbitons .    </S>",
    "<S> the easiest way to answer the above question is to calculate the norm @xmath44 of the wavefunction on the @xmath12 sublattice given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : ansatza ] ) , and similarly @xmath45 for the @xmath13 sublattice . </S>",
    "<S> naturally , @xmath46 which yields the following suggestion : if the sum of the norms of the @xmath42 first terms of the wavefunction fulfills the equation @xmath47 , then all terms with @xmath43 in the reiter s wavefunction can be neglected .    in order to deduce what </S>",
    "<S> is the value of @xmath42 for different values of the orbiton energy @xmath1 we calculated numerically @xmath48 for @xmath49 as a function of @xmath1 on a mesh of @xmath50 @xmath51 points , is calculated directly from the green s function @xcite and not from the normalization factor to the wavefunction . ] </S>",

    "<S> we conclude that : ( @xmath53 ) for both cases for @xmath54 the norm of the wavefunction is close to @xmath55 already for @xmath56 and hence there are just up to three orbitons participating in the formation of a polaron , ( @xmath57 ) it seems that _ only few more _ orbitons are excited for smaller @xmath1 , and ( @xmath58 ) for the case _ with _ three - site terms @xmath59 depends slightly on the momentum @xmath25  it follows the dependence of the qp spectral weight @xmath60 on @xmath61 , with a maximum at @xmath62 , i.e. at the minimum of @xmath63 , cf . </S>",
    "<S> eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : disp ] ) , and ( @xmath64 ) the dependence of @xmath59 on @xmath25 found _ only when _ the three - site terms are included demonstrates that the three - site terms are indeed responsible for the formation of mobile polarons .     </S>",

    "<S> all of the results do not depend on the sublattice index @xmath52.,title=\"fig : \" ]    _ summary _ as a summary , it is instructive to compare the results of the realistic orbital @xmath0@xmath1 model ( i.e. _ with _ three - site terms included ) with those obtained for the spin ising model and for the spin su(2 ) symmetric model in refs . @xcite-@xcite . on one hand , for all @xmath40 </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the norm @xmath48 on @xmath25 resembles to some extent the spin su(2 ) model . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , a closer look reveals that even for @xmath67 the dependence of @xmath59 on @xmath1 is a concave function for all @xmath40 just as for the spin ising case and unlike in the @xmath68 case where it can be a convex function of @xmath1 for some @xmath40 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the detailed study of the reiter s vavefunction of the orbital polaron confirms that the hole doped into the @xmath2 ao forms a _ mobile _ polaron just like the mobile spin polaron in the af plane of high-@xmath69 cuprates @xcite but its properties are truly distinct , in agreement with discussion in ref . </S>",
