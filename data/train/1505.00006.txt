    "the stellar population of galaxies consists of objects of various classes each of which can be an x - ray source through physical processes of different nature . in particular , in binary systems with neutron stars , black holes , and white dwarfs , x - ray emission is generated during the accretion of matter onto compact objects ; stars of late spectral types have active coronas in which matter heated to millions and tens of millions degrees is an origin of x - ray emission ; young stars can heat up matter in strong wind flows emitted by them ; etc .",
    "analysis of the physical processes in these objects often has to be made by studying a whole population of sources of a certain class , which makes it necessary to perform sky surveys and to identify detected sources .    in view of different design features of the instruments capable of performing all - sky surveys and despite their continuously improving characteristics , so far even the most sensitive rxte ( revnivtsev et al . 2004 ) , integral ( krivonos et al .",
    "2007 ) , and swift ( baumgartner et al .",
    "2013 ) all - sky surveys have a sensitivity @xmath1 .",
    "the rosat sky survey performed at a sensitivity of @xmath2  ( voges et al .",
    "1999 ) constitutes an exception .",
    "however , this survey was performed at energies below 2 kev , an energy range strongly affected by interstellar absorption , which significantly limited its capabilities to study objects in the galactic disk .",
    "observations with more sensitive instruments within the framework of special survey programs ( see , e.g. , wang et al .",

    "2004 ; saxton et al . 2008",
    "; evans et al . 2010 , 2014 ; warwick 2014 ) also make it possible to obtain surveys of some galactic regions .",
    "however , since the field of view of focal telescopes is small , they all cover only small areas in the sky .",
    "so far the asca surveys ( sugizaki et al . 2001 ; sakano et al . 2002 ) have been among the most extensive ( in galactic center and galactic plane coverage ) surveys performed by x - ray telescopes with focusing optics at energies above 2 kev .    however , these surveys have also a significant shortcoming : a substantial fraction of the objects detected in these surveys are of unknown nature in view of the insufficient asca angular resolution , which makes it difficult to use them to study various populations of objects in our galaxy .",
    "in addition , the analysis of asca data , the search for sources , and their detection have been significantly hampered by the proper allowance for the contribution from the galactic ridge x - ray emission , allowance for the influence of bright objects , etc .",
    "the latest - generation chandra and xmm - newton x - ray observatories have carried out systematic observations of the sky fields in which sources were detected in the asca surveys for a long time .",
    "this allows one to improve considerably the astrometric positions of x - ray sources and then to carry out optical or infrared observations to determine their nature ( degenaar et al .",
    "2012 ; anderson et al .",
    "2014 ) .    in a harder x - ray band ( @xmath3 kev ) , the most sensitive galactic center and",
    "galactic plane survey is the integral one ( krivonos et al .",
    "this survey has a high identification completeness of detected sources ( @xmath4% ) and a deep and fairly uniform ( in exposure ) coverage of the inner part of the galactic plane , which allows statistical and population studies of x - ray sources of various classes to be performed ( see , e.g. , revnivtsev et al . 2008 and lutovinov et al . 2013 , for low - mass and high - mass x - ray binaries , respectively ) .",
    "the galactic center region is of particular interest for investigating the spatial distribution of high - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "this is because , according to the theory of stellar evolution , such objects representing the young population of the galaxy must concentrate toward the regions of enhanced star formation , i.e. , toward the spiral arms .",
    "currently available observational data confirm this viewpoint ( see , e.g. , grimm et al .",
    "2002 ; lutovinov et al . 2005 ; bodaghee et al . 2012 ; and references therein ) . at the same time",
    ", it should be noted that high - mass x - ray binaries can , in principle , also exist in galactic bulges ( a bulge is a thickening observed at the centers of spiral galaxies ) , in regions where star formation processes take place ( for example , in molecular clouds ) , but so far there are no unambiguous observational confirmations of this . within the framework of our program for search high - mass x - ray binaries in the galactic bulge",
    ", we are performing a systematic analysis of all the unidentified xray sources detected in the asca and integral galactic center surveys to establish their nature and to determine distances to them .",
    "we have selected a total of 17 sources from the asca survey and 7 objects from the integral survey for this study .    in this paper",
    ", we present the results of the first stage of this program within the framework of which we have identified six faint objects from the asca survey with the help of spectroscopic observations of candidates at the russian - turkish 1.5-m telescope ( rtt-150 ) using the _ tfosc _ medium- and low - resolution spectrometer .",
    "figure 1 shows the map of the galactic center region with coordinates @xmath5 , @xmath6 , obtained by summing all the available integral data over the period of observations 2003 2014 in the 1760 kev energy band ( the total exposure time is more than 40 ms ) .",
    "darker regions correspond to the positions of brighter objects in hard x - rays .",
    "the positions of the sources detected in the asca surveys are indicated by circles of different colors : the green color indicates the sources whose nature is known ( their widely used names rather than the names from the surveys themselves are given ) ; the red color marks the objects whose nature has not yet been established .",
    "a total of 42 sources detected by asca in this sky field are shown on the map , for 25 of which the type and class have already been determined , while the nature of 17 more sources is unknown .",
    "six of these 17 objects , which are the subject of our studies in this paper , are additionally marked by the red squares .",
    "note that all these sources are in the first quadrant and are distinguished by the fact that the optical counterparts are optically bright stars .",
    "the latter has allowed us to perform their optical spectroscopy and , in the long run , to determine their nature .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ axs_int_image ] that the signal from some of the objects detected by asca is also registered in hard x - rays , with this being also true for the sources of unknown nature .",
    "however , none of the objects investigated in this paper was detected at a statistically significant level by integral .",
    "the ( @xmath7 ) upper limits on the 2040 kev fluxes from           [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     four sources , axj173548 - 3207 , axj173628- 3141 , axj1739.5 - 2910 , and axj1740.5 - 2937 , are @xmath8 mcrab .",
    "formally , emission with fluxes of @xmath9 and @xmath10 mcrab is registered from position boxes of two other sources , axj1740.4 - 2856 and axj1743.9 - 2846 , respectively .",
    "however , given the insufficiently high angular resolution of the _ ibis_/integral telescope ( 12 , winkler et al 2003 ) , additional studies have established that these fluxes do not belong to the objects under study : the measured flux for axj1743.9 - 2846 is most likely attributable to the contribution of emission from the nearby source grs1741.9 - 2853 , while the emission from the error circle of axj1740.4 - 2856 actually belongs to a different source from the asca survey , axj1740.1 - 2847 ( mereminsky et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "the positional accuracies for the sources in the asca galactic center and galactic plane surveys are 50  and 1 , respectively ( sugizaki et al . 2001 ; sakano et al . 2002 ) , which is insufficient to identify the detected objects with optical and infrared sources and to determine their nature .",
    "nevertheless , owing to the data obtained in the special chandra , xmm - newton , and _",
    "xrt_/swift galactic center surveys , we have been able to identify the sources detected by asca with objects in these surveys .",
    "it should be noted that we took the astrometric positions of the corresponding objects from the chandra / xmm - newton/ xrt surveys ( evans et al .",
    "2010 , degenaar et al .",
    "2012 , evans et al .",
    "2014 ) , and the 3xmm - dr4 catalogue .",
    "this allowed us to measure their x - ray spectra and fluxes , to compare results obtained with the asca results , and to perform spectroscopic observations of the probable optical counterparts to these systems .",
    "the table gives the names of the corresponding objects and their j magnitudes from the 2mass catalog and , for the hard counterpart to axj173628 - 3141 , from the vvv / eso ( the vista telescope ) survey .    in the next section , we present results of our optical observations and discuss the nature of each source separately , while here we will consider results of spectral analysis in the x - ray wavelength range in general terms .",

    "xrt_/swift spectra of the six program sources in the 0.510 kev energy band .",
    "the best fits to these spectra and the corresponding fluxes are presented in the table .",
    "the fluxes are given in three energy bands : 0.52 , 210 , and 0.710 kev .",
    "the measurements in the first two bands provide information about the ratio of the soft and hard x - ray fluxes , while the last band allows the results of our measurements to be compared with the asca results obtained in the 0.7 10 kev energy band as well .",
    "the spectra of almost all sources can be satisfactorily described by a power law with absorption at low energies ; the corresponding values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 are given in the table .",
    "for very soft sources , in the spectra of which there are virtually no photons with energies @xmath02 kev , we used the thermal cevmkl model of the multi - temperature plasma emission from the xspec package ; the corresponding maximum temperature is given in the table .",
    "note in advance that most of objects under study have turned out to be active giants or subgiants of late spectral types ( g  k ) , probably rs cvn binaries .",
    "therefore , to fit spectra of the brightest sources , axj1739.5 - 2910 and axj1743.9 - 2846 , we used a power law with a break in the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 are the slopes of the spectrum before and after the break at energy @xmath15 .",
    "we fixed @xmath16 and @xmath15 at 0.5 and 0.9 kev , respectively , typical of them ( sazonov et al .",

    "ibis_/integral data is based on the balanced cross - correlation algorithm ( for a description , see krivonos et al .",
    "2010 ; churazov et al .",

    "the optical spectra of the sources were taken with the _ tfosc _ medium- and low - resolution spectrometer of rtt-150 using a grism that provided a resolution of about 12 - 15  and a high quantum efficiency in a wide spectral range , 4000 - 9000 .",
    "since all sources have declinations @xmath18 and are at very large zenith angles for rtt-150 ( the telescope is located at latitude 36@xmath19 49@xmath20 n , and longitude 30@xmath19 20@xmath20 e ) , the absolute accuracy of our spectrophotometric measurements is low ; therefore , we normalized the spectrum of an object to its continuum for the subsequent analysis .",

    "similar spectra were also obtained by torres et al .",
    "( 2014 ) for the x - ray sources from the galactic bulge survey identified as low - mass x - ray binaries in their low state .",
    "the total number of photons registered by chandra from the error circle of ax j173548 - 3207 is too small ( 46 ) to carry out detailed studies of its x - ray spectrum .",

    "the x - ray luminosity we derived is at the brightest edge of the distribution ; in particular , it can be higher than the x - ray luminosity of known rs cvn binaries within 50 pc of the sun ( see , e.g. , makarov 2003 ) .    ) with temperature @xmath92 k. the dotted straight lines mark the absorption bands in the earth s atmosphere . ]",
    "in this paper , we analyzed the x - ray and optical observations of six sources from the asca galactic center and galactic plane surveys : axj173548 - 3207 , axj173628 - 3141 , axj1739.5 - 2910 , axj1740.4 - 2856 , axj1740.5 - 2937 , and axj1743.9 - 2846 .",
    "these surveys are presently the deepest largearea ( about 45 square degrees ) surveys performed by focusing x - ray telescopes at energies above 2 kev , the energy band that is weakly affected by interstellar photoabsorption .",
    "we obtained an unambiguous identification for five of the six objects ; accurate chandra x - ray measurements for one more object ( axj173628 - 3141 ) reveal two x - ray sources within its localization region ( soft and hard ) of comparable brightness in the 0.58 kev energy band .",
    "three of the five sources with an unambiguous identification are active g  k stars , presumably rs cvn binaries .",
    "one of the two objects in the error circle of axj173628 - 3141 is a coronally active g star , while the other object is a symbiotic star , a red giant with an accreting white dwarf , presumably located in the galactic center region .",
    "axj1740.4 - 2856 is a coronally active red m0 - 2 dwarf ; one more source , axj173548 - 3207 , is presumably an x - ray binary in our galaxy ( most likely a low - mass one ) in its low state .",
    "we estimated the distances and corresponding luminosities in the soft x - ray band ( 0.510 kev ) for all sources , with none of them having been detected at a statistically significant level at energies > 20 kev based on integral data .",
    "this work was supported by the russian science foundation ( grant 14 - 22 - 00271 ) .",
    "we used the data retrieved from the archives of the goddard space flight center ( nasa ) and the european southern observatory .",
