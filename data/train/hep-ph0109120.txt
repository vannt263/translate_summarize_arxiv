    "new data on neutrino oscillations from experiments like superkamiokande  @xcite and sno  @xcite , have provided a means of testing theories of fermion masses . the simple idea that the observed hierarchies in the quark and charged lepton mass spectrum may be due to the sequential breaking of a horizontal symmetry has led to an expansive literature on possible symmetries and symmetry breaking patterns  @xcite .",
    "models based on non - abelian flavor symmetries like u(2 ) are interesting in that yukawa matrices decompose into a small set of flavor group representations , and the textures possible after symmetry breaking are often highly restricted .",
    "hierarchies in these textures are not difficult to obtain , since each stage of flavor symmetry breaking is associated with a small dimensionless parameter that appears in the low - energy effective lagrangian ( namely , the ratio of a vacuum expectation value to the cut off of the effective theory ) .",
    "it is much harder to see how the breaking of a non - abelian symmetry that leads to strictly hierarchical quark and charged lepton yukawa matrices can account for the two large mixing angles suggested by the current solar and atmospheric neutrino data  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will show how this situation can arise naturally in models with ",
    "u(2)-like \" yukawa textures ; we define what we mean by this more explicitly below .",
    "study of ways in which large neutrino mixing angles can arise in u(2)-like models is worthwhile since these theories can potentially explain all fermion masses and mixing angles in one consistent framework .",
    "let us briefly review the minimal u(2 ) model  @xcite , which has been described in detail elsewhere in the literature .",
    "u(2 ) is assumed to be a global symmetry that acts across the three standard model generations .",
    "quarks and leptons are assigned to @xmath0 representations , so that in tensor notation , one may represent the three generations of any matter field by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a u(2 ) index , and @xmath3 is @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , or @xmath8 .",
    "a set of symmetry breaking fields are introduced consisting of @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a u(2 ) doublet , and @xmath13 @xmath14 is a symmetric ( antisymmetric ) u(2 ) triplet ( singlet ) .",
    "these fields are assumed to develop the pattern of vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) @xmath15@xmath16 which follows from the sequential symmetry breaking @xmath17 this leads to the canonical u(2 ) texture @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 are order one coefficients that are also determined by fitting to the data  @xcite . the parameter @xmath22 is explained below .",
    "here we have displayed @xmath23 since the up quark yukawa matrix requires additional suppression factors to explain why @xmath24 while @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the cabibbo angle .",
    "for example , in su(5)@xmath27u(2 ) unified models , combined gut and flavor symmetries prevent the @xmath13 and @xmath28 flavons from coupling at lowest order in @xmath29 , provided that the @xmath13 flavon is chosen to transform as a * 75 * under su(5 ) .",
    "however , the presence of an su(5 ) adjoint field @xmath30 with @xmath31 leads to the viable texture @xmath32 the ratio @xmath33 is fixed by hand through the choice of the small parameter @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "note that the additional suppression factor multiplying the @xmath13 and @xmath28 flavon vevs can also be accommodated in models based on discrete subgroups of u(2 ) without requiring a grand unified embedding . in some of these models",
    ", @xmath34 is a prediction of the theory  @xcite .",
    "the feature crucial to the success of the u(2 ) model is the existence of a u(1 ) subgroup that rotates first generation fields by a phase .",
    "notice that the @xmath35 entries in eq  ( [ eq : u2 yd ] ) appear in the most general way consistent with this symmetry , while the @xmath36 entries which break the u(1 ) appear only in the first row and column .",
    "the fact that the u(1 ) breaking is accomplished by the antisymmetric flavon @xmath28 alone is a dynamical assumption , at least at the level of the low - energy effective theory . from this point of view",
    ", there is nothing wrong with vevs of order @xmath37 arising , for example , in the first component of a doublet or symmetrically in the off - diagonal components of @xmath13 .",
    "we will define a ",
    "u(2)-like \" model as any one whose yukawa matrices decompose into symmetric triplet , doublet , and antisymmetric singlet representations , and whose nonvanishing yukawa entries are of a size consistent with the u(2 ) symmetry breaking pattern given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : symbrk ] ) .",
    "let us illustrate this definition with a concrete example :    the smallest non - abelian discrete subgroup of u(2 ) with * 1 * , * 2 * , and * 3 * dimensional representations , and with the multiplication rule @xmath38 is the double tetrahedral group , @xmath39 .",
    "models based on @xmath40 , and the breaking pattern  @xcite @xmath41 can exactly reproduce the yukawa textures of a u(2 ) model when matter fields are assigned to appropriate one- and two - dimensional representations .",
    "the symmetry @xmath42 is a diagonal subgroup that provides the desired phase rotation on first generation fields .",
    "moreover , doublet , triplet and nontrivial singlet @xmath39 representations can be found that are in one - to - one correspondence with the @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath28 flavons of the original u(2 ) model . in ref",
    "@xcite , models based on @xmath39 symmetry were constructed with an additional doublet flavon that affected only the neutrino mass matrix textures : @xmath43 the pattern of vevs in @xmath44 is the most general one consistent with eq .",
    "( [ eq : symbrk2 ] ) and leads to the neutrino mass matrix textures  @xcite @xmath45 @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the right - handed neutrino mass scale , and @xmath48 , @xmath49 are @xmath50 coefficients .",
    "these textures are u(2)-like in that each entry is of a size consistent with the two - stage symmetry breaking pattern in eq .",
    "( [ eq : symbrk ] ) ; the precise power of @xmath35 or @xmath36 that appears is determined in this example by the details of the @xmath39 group theory .",
    "the left - handed majorana mass matrix follows from the seesaw mechanism @xmath51 and has the form @xmath52 as promised , a large 2 - 3 mixing angle has emerged from initial u(2)-like textures without any adjustment of parameters .",
    "the 1 - 2 mixing angle , of order @xmath53 , is naturally of the same size as the cabibbo angle . by choosing the @xmath50 coefficients appropriately , it is possible to numerically enhance this result to obtain the smallest mixing angle values consistent with the msw large mixing angle ( lma ) allowed parameter region given in ref .",
    "such solutions were considered in quantitative detail in ref .",
    "however , the fact that the current data appears to prefer relatively large mixing angles suggests another possibility : @xmath54 is a perturbation about a bimaximal mixing texture  @xcite that appears at lowest order in the symmetry breaking parameters .",
    "it is this possibility that we explore in the sections that follow .",
    "what is intriguing about the result in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mllexample ] ) is that it is superficially of the form suggested by haba  @xcite for achieving bimaximal mixing , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a small parameter , and @xmath57 a characteristic mass scale .",
    "the crucial difference is that the @xmath50 sub - block of the haba texture is assumed to be of rank one , up to corrections of order @xmath56 or smaller .",
    "a diagonalization of the largest entries leaves a matrix of the form @xmath58 which requires a large 1 - 2 rotation angle to diagonalize further .",
    "we now demonstrate that it is possible to achieve the haba texture via the seesaw mechanism in u(2)-like theories .",
    "our approach is to determine first the minimal number of entries in @xmath59 and @xmath60 that can reproduce the rank - one sub - block of eq .",
    "( [ eq : haba ] ) .",
    "we will then perturb about this texture by lifting the smallest number of texture zeros that allows for a viable phenomenology .",
    "the only organizing principle that we retain in this model - independent analysis is that entries in the first row and column of @xmath59 and @xmath60 must involve the appropriate power of @xmath36 to be consistent with the breaking of some subgroup that rotates the fields of the first generation by a phase .",
    "we begin with the observation that the matrices @xmath61 and @xmath62 lead via the seesaw to @xmath63 the sub - block has a vanishing determinant , by inspection ) and ( [ eq : mrrmin ] ) is completely general , given that we have not specified the size of @xmath35 or @xmath36 . ] .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ eq : mllmin ] ) that the entries shown in ( [ eq : mlrmin ] ) and ( [ eq : mrrmin ] ) are a minimal choice ; if one sets any of the parameters to zero , one either renders @xmath60 singular or loses the large @xmath64-@xmath65 mixing angle in the final result . note also that the textures in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mlrmin ] ) and ( [ eq : mrrmin ] ) are consistent with the symmetry breaking in eq  ( [ eq : symbrk ] ) , but require one fine tuning to be obtained : the @xmath66-@xmath64 block of @xmath59 can arise only by a specific linear combination of symmetric and antisymmetric flavon vevs . in the more realistic textures that follow , such a fine tuning will not be required .",
    "finally , we point out that certain texture zeros , in particular the @xmath65-@xmath65 entries of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , do not appear in the simplest formulation of u(2 ) models",
    ". however , as we mentioned earlier , such textures do arise in models based on discrete subgroups of u(2 )  @xcite . in section  4",
    "we will see how they can also arise in models with u(2 ) symmetry and additional abelian factors .",
    "we now seek the minimal modifications of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mlrmin ] ) and ( [ eq : mrrmin ] ) that provide for a viable phenomenology and are theoretically well motivated . to avoid any fine tuning between irreducible symmetric and antisymmetric representations ,",
    "the first zero that we choose to lift is the @xmath66-@xmath64 entry of @xmath59 .",
    "hence , we consider the modification @xmath67 which leads to @xmath68 if we identify @xmath53 with @xmath56 , we obtain a texture of the same form as eq .",
    "( [ eq : haba ] ) , with the desired rank one sub - block . unfortunately , the texture in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mlltwo ] ) is still not viable due to a specific relationship between the coefficients : the @xmath66-@xmath64 and @xmath66-@xmath65 entries appear in the same ratio as the @xmath64-@xmath64 and @xmath64-@xmath65 entries .",
    "diagonalization of the largest elements leaves a matrix of the form @xmath69 and no large @xmath66-@xmath64 mixing angle is obtained .",
    "it is necessary to lift at least one additional texture zero in order to disrupt this proportionality of coefficients .",
    "we find that the minimal choice , in which only one additional entry is altered , is unique : @xmath70 from here we finally obtain @xmath71 we will refer to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : minformin ] ) and ( [ eq : minformout ] ) as our minimal bimaximal mixing textures .    at this point",
    ", it is important that we be specific on the meaning of the zero entries in eq .",
    "( [ eq : minformout ] ) .",
    "we assume simply that there are no contributions to these entries at linear order in the symmetry - breaking parameters .",
    "as we will see in section  4 , most realistic models imply that texture zeroes are lifted at some order in the flavor expansion , unless those entries are protected by holomorphy .",
    "this is of significance to the phenomenological analysis presented in the next section for the following reason : while the ratio @xmath72 that follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : minformout ] ) is naturally of the right size to account for atmospheric and lma solar neutrino oscillations , the experimentally preferred value of @xmath73 is noticeably less than @xmath74 .",
    "corrections to the zero entries allow us numerically to obtain mixing angles consistent with allowed 95% confidence region .",
    "in particular , we will study the more general form @xmath75 since the higher - order @xmath76 entry is quite effective at allowing adjustment of @xmath73 , and is easily accommodated in realistic models .",
    "it is worth pointing out that u(2)-like values for @xmath35 and @xmath36 are not consistent with the low or vacuum oscillation solutions to the solar neutrino problem , since each requires a value of @xmath77 that is much larger than that predicted from eq .",
    "( [ eq : minformout ] ) .",
    "we now study the textures in eq .",
    "( [ eq : minformin ] ) and ( [ eq : nonminformin ] ) numerically , and show that atmospheric and large angle solar neutrino oscillations can be obtained . in the spirit of model independence , we assume a form for the charged lepton yukawa matrix that arises generically in u(2)-like models : @xmath78 the factor of @xmath65 that multiplies @xmath79 is the famous one suggested by georgi and jarlskog  @xcite , and arises as a consequence of grand unified group theory .",
    "we fit to leptonic observables while fixing @xmath80 and @xmath81 ; these are the preferred values obtained in fitting eq .",
    "( [ eq : u2 yd ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : u2yu ] ) to quark masses and ckm angles .",
    "this constrained fit is a reasonable approximation to a more involved global one , given the relatively large experimental uncertainty on each of the neutrino observables .",
    "we assume that the textures @xmath54 and @xmath82 are defined at some high scale , which we take to be @xmath83 gev , and perform a renormalization group analysis of the gauge and yukawa couplings .",
    "we do this by solving the one - loop renormalization group equations ( rge s ) of the mssm  @xcite from @xmath84 down to the electroweak scale taken to be @xmath85 gev .",
    "values of the gauge couplings at @xmath84 are obtained by starting with the precision values extracted at the scale @xmath86  @xcite , @xmath87 the gauge couplings are run from @xmath86 to @xmath88 using the one - loop standard model ( sm ) rge s , and then from @xmath88 to @xmath84 using the one - loop mssm rge s .",
    "the rge for the neutrino majorana mass matrix @xmath54 was computed in ref .",
    "@xcite and is included here in order to complete the rge evolution for all observables .    in order to perform the fits we incorporate experimental and theoretical uncertainties on the observables . for the charged leptons , they are either those appearing in ref .",
    "@xcite or @xmath89 of the central value of the given datum , whichever is larger .",
    "the latter , theoretical uncertainty takes into account that two - loop corrections to the running and possible high - scale threshold corrections have been neglected .",
    "the low - energy neutrino observables are taken to be @xmath90 which were extracted from refs .",

    "lepton masses and neutrino mixing angles are converted to yukawa couplings @xmath95 , and contribute an amount @xmath96 to @xmath93 , as usual .",
    "there are 6 observables ( 3 charged lepton masses , 2 neutrino mixing angles , and 1 neutrino mass ratio ) and 11 parameters @xmath92 ; on the surface , it seems that the fit is always under - constrained .",
    "however , our demand that the parameters @xmath92 lie near unity imposes additional restrictions , which we include by adding terms to @xmath93 of the form @xmath97 for each @xmath98 .",
    "thus , the parameters @xmath92 are effectively no longer free , but are to be treated analogously to pieces of data , each of which contributes one unit to @xmath93 if it is as large as 3 or as small as 1/3   is a matter of taste . ] .",
    "thus , the value of @xmath99 determining a ` good ' fit is 6 , since there are 6 pieces of true data and effectively no _ unconstrained _ fit parameters .",

    "we now demonstrate that it is possible to construct models that realize the textures studied numerically in the previous section .",
    "we aim for the basic forms @xmath102 as mentioned earlier , it will require more than just u(2 ) symmetry to account for these textures .",
    "for one , there is no invariant @xmath65-@xmath65 entry in each matrix , as one would expect in a minimal u(2 ) model with the generations assigned to @xmath103 representations .",
    "moreover , these textures imply the existence of three doublet fields , with distinct couplings , while u(2 ) provides only for one .",
    "the simplest approach , which we will utilize here for the purposes of providing an existence proof , is to extend the u(2 ) symmetry by an additional abelian factor  @xcite . at the end , we describe how similar models may be obtained using non - abelian discrete subgroups of u(2 ) .",
    "we present examples that do and do not require a unified gauge group , respectively :      in this model we let the superfields @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 transform as @xmath105 where the subscript indicates the @xmath106 charge ( _ i.e. _ the subscripts add modulo 5 ) .",

    "thus , the predictions of the minimal unified u(2 ) model are maintained .",
    "the pattern of vevs in the doublet flavons is a dynamical assumption , at the level of our effective field theory analysis , but is at least well motivated : it is known that minima of potentials occur at enhanced symmetry points , and the pattern of vevs is one consistent with the sequential breaking in eq .",

    "for some discussion of possible flavon potentials in u(2 ) models , see ref .",
    "@xcite . finally , we point out that the presence of additional fields with vacuum expectation values can perturb these textures ; this is not unlikely given that additional fields are usually required in constructing a realistic flavon potential .",
