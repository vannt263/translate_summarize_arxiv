    "<S> we present preliminary results for the axial and tensor charge of the nucleon obtained from simulations with @xmath0 clover fermions . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison with chiral perturbation theory is attempted .    </S>",
    "<S> lattice qcd offers the possibility to investigate the internal structure of the nucleon without additional model assumptions . in particular , one can study how the mass , the axial charge and further properties of the nucleon change when the quark mass is varied or the nucleon is squeezed into a finite spatial box . even if we could simulate at the physical quark mass and in a huge volume </S>",
    "<S> , we would like to examine the dependence on the quark mass and on the volume , because it contains important information on low - energy qcd . </S>",
    "<S> this information can be extracted by comparing the outcome of lattice qcd simulations with parameterisations provided by chiral effective field theories ( cheft ) .    </S>",
    "<S> this comparison with cheft , if successful , leads to two important achievements : firstly , it gives us control over the chiral extrapolation and the thermodynamic limit of the simulation results and secondly it allows us to determine phenomenologically relevant coupling constants in cheft .    in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we shall present preliminary results from simulations with @xmath1 non - perturbatively improved wilson quarks and the standard plaquette action for the gauge fields obtained by the qcdsf and ukqcd  @xcite collaborations . </S>",
    "<S> previous quenched qcdsf results can be found in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and for a review see ref .  @xcite . for the time being we do not yet perform an extrapolation to the continuum limit and neglect lattice artefacts .    </S>",
    "<S> originally , cheft was invented to describe the quark mass dependence of low - energy quantities by means of effective hadron fields . </S>",
    "<S> however , for sufficiently large volumes and sufficiently small pion masses , finite size effects are dominated by pions `` propagating around the world '' , and therefore cheft can also be used to calculate the volume dependence : the effective lagrangian is independent of the volume .    </S>",
    "<S> our paradigm is the analysis of the nucleon mass  @xcite , where we could describe the pion mass dependence and the finite size effects up to surprisingly large masses by formulae derived from relativistic baryon chiral perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> we are trying to perform a similar analysis also for the axial and the tensor charge of the nucleon , and in the following we shall report on the status of these attempts . </S>",
    "<S> whenever we need numbers in physical units , we shall set the scale using @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> compared with the case of the nucleon mass there are several additional difficulties when dealing with such matrix elements of composite operators :    * the cheft calculations are not as advanced as for the nucleon mass . * in order to suppress lattice artefacts , the operators should be improved . however , the required improvement coefficients are not yet known non - perturbatively . in the following , we shall present results from the unimproved operators . </S>",
    "<S> * the operators have to be renormalised . </S>",
    "<S> we shall use non - perturbative renormalisation factors computed by means of the rome - southampton method with a linear chiral extrapolation at fixed bare gauge coupling . * </S>",
    "<S> the quark - line disconnected contributions to the matrix elements are hard to evaluate . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we shall consider only flavour - nonsinglet quantities , where these contributions cancel .    in order to compute the axial form factor of the nucleon @xmath3 on the lattice we use the flavour - nonsinglet axial vector current @xmath4 and the form factor decomposition of its proton matrix element . </S>",
    "<S> using the so - called small scale expansion , which takes @xmath5 degrees of freedom explicitly into account , the authors of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite have studied the mass dependence of the nucleon axial charge @xmath6 to @xmath7 and compared with quenched data .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.ga ] we perform a similar comparison with our presently available dynamical data for @xmath8 choosing some reasonable values for the parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the curve reproduces the weak mass dependence of the simulation results as well as the physical point , at least approximately , but the chiral logarithm dominates only for very small pion masses .    </S>",
    "<S> what about the finite size effects for @xmath8 ? there are indications that they could be quite large ( for a quenched study see , e.g. , ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , and they might not yet be negligible for the results in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.ga ] . </S>",
    "<S> we have performed simulations on three different volumes at the same bare gauge coupling and quark mass , leading to @xmath9 on the largest lattice , and found a clear volume dependence . </S>",
    "<S> first calculations within cheft have appeared  @xcite . to @xmath10 in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory ( without explicit @xmath5s ) one finds @xmath11 \\displaystyle \\quad { }    - \\frac{g_a^0 m_\\pi^2}{4 \\pi^2 f_\\pi^2 } \\left ( 1 + { \\mbox{\\small $ \\frac{2}{3}$}}(g_a^0)^2 \\right )   \\sum_{\\vec{n } } { } ^\\prime \\frac{k_1(l |\\vec{n}| m_\\pi)}{l |\\vec{n}| m_\\pi } \\ , , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the value of @xmath8 in the chiral limit and @xmath13 is the pion decay constant . in fig .  [ fig.gafs ] we plot our data together with the above expression for the finite size effect . </S>",
    "<S> not even the sign is reproduced correctly . </S>",
    "<S> of course , one may blame the large pion mass in connection with the low order of chiral perturbation theory for this discrepancy , and further investigations are clearly needed .    </S>",
    "<S> the tensor charge of the nucleon is the lowest moment of the transversity distribution @xmath14 . for flavour @xmath15 </S>",
    "<S> it is given by the proton matrix element @xmath16 with @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> again , we restrict ourselves to the flavour nonsinglet combination @xmath18 and plot it in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.combi ] together with @xmath8 data , because in the non - relativistic limit one expects that both quantities agree . </S>",
    "<S> hence this comparison gives us some information on how relativistic the quarks in our simulations are and the data seem to indicate that the quarks are not very relativistic .    </S>",
    "<S> concluding we may say that the interpretation of our results is only at its beginning . </S>",
    "<S> once we have analysed our configurations completely , we hope to gain more insight into the structure of the nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> but further improvements are certainly desirable , in particular smaller quark masses and lattice spacings in the monte carlo simulations as well as more extensive calculations in cheft . </S>"
