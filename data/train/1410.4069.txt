    "the stability of impedance driven modes is usually ensured by non - linearities via landau damping .",
    "the strength of the landau damping is represented in a stability diagram , defining the area of complex tune shifts which can be kept stable  @xcite .",
    "the computation of the stability diagram is a crucial element for the evaluation of the non - linearity required for the beam stability .",
    "it can be done analytically in many simple cases , in particular considering lattice non - linearities and a limited number of beam  beam interactions .",
    "facing the complexity of the lhc collision scheme , a numerical approach seems more appropriate . in particular , the dispersion integral is solved numerically using the amplitude detuning provided by single particle tracking , thus allowing the computation of stability diagrams in arbitrarily complex cases .",
    "following the same approach , the effect of non - gaussian distribution functions can be introduced in the computation .",
    "previous studies have shown that the distribution function plays a crucial role in the stability diagram  @xcite and , being usually poorly known , greatly diminishes the predicting power of such a consideration .",
    "the numerical evaluation of the stability diagram allows us to go further in the understanding of this effect by using a non - analytical distribution function .",
    "in particular , coloured external noise is known to enhance diffusion of resonant particles  @xcite , greatly modifying the distribution and therefore the stability diagram .",
    "the method to derive the stability of impedance driven multibunch modes by placing their tune shifts in the stability diagram derived using the lattice non - linearities , as described in  @xcite , considers bunches with identical detuning . in the lhc ,",
    "this assumption is no longer valid once beam  beam effects are considered .",
    "indeed , the asymmetric layout of the interaction points as well as the asymmetric filling scheme lead to a variety of bunches having significantly different detuning . theoretical treatment of the beam stability in such configurations is currently lacking .",
    "it is however possible to assess these cases using multiparticle tracking simulation  @xcite , at the expense of large computational power .",
    "the beam  beam interactions do not only introduce bunch dependent detuning , they also change the nature of the coherent modes .",
    "the landau damping of beam  beam modes in the single bunch regime is addressed in  @xcite , the extension to multibunch coherent beam  beam mode is , however , not trivial .",
    "preliminary studies by the means of multiparticle tracking simulation are presented in  @xcite .",
    "such an approach is well suited to studying the lhc in its full complexity , however it is very demanding in terms of computing power .",
    "it is therefore interesting to consider simplified cases . in this paper",
    ", we address the stability of single bunch impedance modes with detuning from the lattice and beam  beam interactions , in other words , multibunch effects from the impedance as well as beam  beam coherent mode are neglected .",
    "these drastic assumptions are motivated by the observation , in the lhc , of single bunch instabilities , while operating in the multibunch regime .",
    "figure  [ fig - observation ] shows such an instability at the end of the squeeze during operation of the lhc in 2012 .",
    "in particular , the measurement of the beam oscillation amplitude provided by the bbq system indicates a coherent instability on beam 1 .",
    "the observation of bunch intensities indicates that only one bunch lost its intensity in an abnormal way , with respect to the other bunches , suggesting that only this bunch had undergone the instability .",
    "considering a case without coupling , the stability diagram of each plane is obtained by solving the dispersion relation for a given detuning @xmath0 and distribution function @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the unperturbed actions in each plane , @xmath4 the @xmath5 found for different values of @xmath6 are the tune shifts at the limit of stability , therefore , they define an area in which the tune shifts are stable . in cases where the denominator is strictly non - zero , the tune shift is purely real , which indicates the absence of landau damping . in the relevant cases ,",
    "the integral possesses poles , and can be evaluated using various techniques . whereas it is difficult to obtain analytically in complex configurations ,",
    "the detuning is easily obtainable numerically .",
    "the dispersion integral can then be evaluated by standard numerical techniques , in our case by adding a vanishing complex part to the denominator .",
    "the detuning is obtained numerically from tracking simulation with mad - x  @xcite .",
    "particles with different actions are tracked for 1024 turns from which the tunes can be evaluated , the result is represented in the tune diagram as a tune footprint ( fig .  [ fig - footprint ] ) .",
    "a significant number of particles is required to reduce the noise in the evaluation of the integrals .",
    "in particular , the effect of resonant driving term on the tracking can have a significant effect on the evaluation of the footprint .",
    "this effect is reduced by an automatic removal of faulty points and interpolation from the closest non - faulty points . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - footprint ] , this technique does not allow us to fully remove distortions due to strong non - linearities , in particular from coupling resonances . in the cases of practical interests ,",
    "however , the effect on the footprint , and consequently on the stability diagram , is tolerable .",
    "the integrity of the footprint is nevertheless systematically checked before deriving a stability diagram .",
    "figure  [ fig - benchmarking ] shows a good agreement between stability diagrams computed analytically and numerically in the case of octupolar detuning using a gaussian distribution .",
    "practical applications of this code for the lhc can be found in  @xcite .",
    "external coloured noise enhances the diffusion of resonant particles . in the presence of amplitude detuning ,",
    "this results in a depletion of certain parts of the distribution .",
    "this effect is illustrated with a simple model , using a multiparticle code that tracks particles through a lattice with amplitude detuning described by @xmath7 the noise is modelled with a sinusoidal excitation with finite correlation time .",
    "the relative difference to the initial distribution in action space after @xmath8 turns is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - distr ] .",
    "the depletion of the distribution at the position of resonant particles is visible .",
    "this effect was already studied for different purposes in  @xcite .",
    "the measurable effect on the distribution in real space is very small ( fig .",
    "[ fig - distr ] ) , the effect on the stability diagram is , however , significant , as illustrated by the comparison of the stability diagrams obtained using the initial and perturbed distributions ( fig .",
    "[ fig - distr ] ) .",
    "the effect illustrated by this simple model can be simulated in more realistic scenarios . in particular ,",
    "the combi code  @xcite , extended with an impedance model , was used to model the action of external noise on a beam stabilized by both amplitude detuning and a transverse feedback .",
    "we consider a study case , where a single bunch is rendered unstable by negative chromaticity .",
    "this study case intends to mimic a situation similar to the lhc at the end of the squeeze where the beams have to be stabilized by high damper gain and high octupole current , while relaxing significantly the need for computational power due to the large number of bunches in this case .",
    "the results are therefore not meant to be compared to measurements , but rather to illustrate an effect that should be studied in more realistic cases in the future .",
    "the upper dot in fig .",
    "[ fig - study case ] shows the coherent tune shift of the most unstable mode , with a large positive imaginary part .",
    "the imaginary part is brought down to the lower dot using a transverse feedback .",
    "the line represents the stability diagram provided by an octupolar amplitude detuning . in this configuration",
    ", this analysis suggests that both the damper and the octupoles are required to stabilize the beam , which is confirmed by tracking ( fig .",
    "[ fig - study case ] ) , showing the oscillation amplitude as a function of time for the different scenarios .",
    "the stable configuration can , however , be rendered unstable by a wideband noise , i.e. a random kick is applied every turn , the kick being constant over the bunch length .",
    "indeed , the response to the wideband noise is more important at the mode frequencies as it can not be entirely damped by a transverse feedback with finite gain .",
    "wideband noise in this configuration has a similar effect on the diffusion as coloured noise , and therefore can compromise the stability from landau damping , as described above . in particular , in fig .",
    "[ fig - study case noise ] , the simulation of the stable case for different noise amplitude shows that the latency time before the instability takes off depends on the noise amplitude .",
    "the extension of this study case to more realistic configurations including multibunch impedance and beam  beam interactions promises great challenges from the computational point of view , but is however not out of reach with current resources .",
    "in particular , one could expect that other sources of diffusion may counterbalance the effect described .",
    "nevertheless , this analysis suggests that the external noise could play a critical role in configurations where both a transverse feedback and amplitude detuning are required to stabilize the beams .",
    "single bunch stability of beams colliding in arbitrary complex configurations can be investigated by numerically solving the dispersion integral , using amplitude detuning derived from single particle tracking simulations .",
    "a new code , based on mad - x output , has been developed to assess the stability of the lhc beams in any operational configuration .",
    "this approach is however not suited to studying the stability of multibunch coherent modes .",
    "the effect of distributions perturbed by external noise on the stability diagram has been investigated using the code mentioned above , and revealed very strong effects for modifications of the distributions well below the sensitivity of current measurements .",
    "it has been shown using multiparticle tracking codes that , indeed , a beam well stabilized by both amplitude detuning and transverse damper could be rendered unstable by the introduction of wideband noise .",
