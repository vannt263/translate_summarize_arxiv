    "the dimensional reduction of the self - dual yang - mills equations to @xmath0 has long been of interest , even though this system does not admit smooth finite - energy solutions with compact gauge group @xcite .",
    "but there are solutions if one allows singularities and/or infinite energy @xcite , or for complex or non - compact gauge group @xcite .",
    "the equations are conformally invariant , and so one can also study the system on general riemann surfaces ; in that context , the equations are known as the hitchin equations , and in particular there are smooth solutions on compact riemann surfaces of genus at least two @xcite . the @xmath0 case , with appropriate boundary conditions ,",
    "may be viewed as a system on @xmath7 with a singularity at infinity ; and more generally one could allow several designated singularities .",
    "there is a natural @xmath3 metric on the space of solutions , although the integral defining it may not always converge ; these moduli - space metrics , when well - defined , are hyperkhler @xcite .",
    "such hitchin systems and their moduli spaces have close connections with supersymmetric field theory : see , for example , reference @xcite .",
    "the focus in this paper is on smooth su(2 ) solutions of the hitchin equations on @xmath0 .",
    "there is a natural boundary condition which involves a positive integer @xmath1 : namely , the determinant @xmath8 of the complex higgs field @xmath9 is taken to be a polynomial of degree  @xmath1 in @xmath10 .",
    "then the solutions generically resemble @xmath1 lumps on @xmath0 , located at the zeros of @xmath8 : the solutions are parametrized by these locations , together with relative angles between the lumps .",
    "some of these parameters have @xmath3 variation , and these are moduli ; this is only possible when @xmath2 , and the main aim below is to describe some of the geometry of the @xmath6 moduli space @xmath11 . in particular , we calculate the asymptotic geometry by using a singular approximation to the fields , and obtain the metric on two natural totally - geodesic surfaces in @xmath11 with the help of a numerical calculation . to begin with",
    ", however , we recall the rotationally - symmetric @xmath4 solution , and describe a one - parameter family of rotationally - symmetric @xmath5 solutions .    some of the methods used below first arose in studies of the hitchin equations on the cylinder @xmath12 , in connection with periodic monopoles @xcite .",
    "periodic monopoles correspond , via the generalized nahm transform , to solutions of the hitchin equations on the cylinder @xmath12 satisfying appropriate boundary conditions . since the cylinder is conformally equivalent to the punctured plane , these hitchin fields are defined on @xmath0 minus a point ( or @xmath7 minus two points ) , and so they do not overlap with the solutions considered below .",
    "let @xmath13 be a smooth su(2 ) gauge potential on @xmath0 , with corresponding gauge field @xmath14 $ ] , and let @xmath9 denote a higgs field taking values in the complexification of the lie algebra @xmath15 .",

    "the system ( [ h1 ] ) is completely - integrable in the sense of having a lax pair , namely the reduction of the lax pair for the self - dual yang - mills equations @xcite .",
    "in addition , for example , the moduli spaces of solutions on riemann surfaces may be regarded as completely - integrable hamiltonian systems @xcite .",
    "it follows from ( [ h1 ] ) that the determinant @xmath19 is holomorphic in @xmath20 ; as a boundary condition , we require that @xmath21 should be a polynomial in @xmath20 , and that @xmath22 as @xmath23 .",
    "such solutions generically have @xmath24 peaked at the zeros of @xmath25 , and we may visualize these as lumps .",

    "if ( [ l2norm ] ) converges , then @xmath26 is a modulus ; whereas if ( [ l2norm ] ) diverges , we refer to @xmath26 as a parameter .",
    "the moduli space @xmath11 is the space of moduli , for fixed values of the parameters .    a useful choice of gauge was described in @xcite ; it may be summarized as follows .",
    "the gauge field @xmath24 is taken to be in the @xmath35-direction in @xmath15 , and @xmath9 has the form @xmath36 here @xmath37 are polynomials in @xmath20 satisfying @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is a smooth real - valued function .",
    "the gauge potential has the form @xmath40 where @xmath41 is smooth complex - valued function .",
    "the hitchin equations then reduce to equations on @xmath39 and @xmath41 , namely @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "the residual gauge freedom consists of constant diagonal su(2 ) transformations , plus conjugating by @xmath44 . in the special case @xmath45 , the equation ( [ psi - eqn ] )",
    "is locally equivalent to the sinh - gordon equation , via a conformal mapping combined with a transformation @xmath46 . in other words , the explicit @xmath20-dependence in ( [ psi - eqn ] ) could then be removed , at the cost of more complicated global conditions on the field @xmath39 .",
    "we are taking @xmath21 to be a polynomial of degree  @xmath1 , so @xmath47 , where the @xmath48 are complex constants .",
    "the hitchin equations are conformally invariant , but the quantity @xmath49 ( say ) sets the length scale , and from now on we shall fix this scale by setting @xmath50 .",
    "the equations also have a rotational symmetry @xmath51 , as well as a global phase symmetry @xmath52 , and these are in effect linked by the argument of @xmath53 ; we fix this phase by setting @xmath54 .",
    "some solutions are rotationally - symmetric , which clearly can only happen if @xmath55 .",
    "we say that the field @xmath56 with @xmath57 is rotationally - symmetric if the rotated field @xmath58 is gauge - equivalent to @xmath59 .",
    "rotationally - symmetric solutions were studied a long time ago , in effect only for the case @xmath60 @xcite ; and also more recently , where it was shown that in certain cases the solutions can be expressed in terms of painlev transcendents @xcite .    although most of the global phase symmetry has been removed by fixing the phase of @xmath53 as we did above",
    ", there is a remnant left over , namely @xmath61 .",
    "now @xmath62 changes the sign of the function @xmath41 appearing in the gauge potential ( [ a - form ] ) , so the @xmath62-invariant fields are precisely those with @xmath45 . by putting @xmath63 in ( [ rotsym ] ) , we see that a rotationally - symmetric field with @xmath1 odd is also @xmath62-invariant . but for @xmath1 even , there are rotationally - symmetric fields which are not @xmath62-invariant , as we shall see in the next section .    for the remainder of this section ,",
    "let us focus on the @xmath4 case .",
    "we can use translation freedom to set @xmath64 .",
    "there is a rotationally - symmetric @xmath4 solution which has its gauge field @xmath24 peaked at @xmath65 ; it is given by ( [ psi - form ] ) and ( [ a - form ] ) with @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath45 , where @xmath69 .",
    "if we change variables to @xmath70 and @xmath71 , then the remaining field equation ( [ psi - eqn ] ) becomes a particular case of the painlev - iii equation , namely @xmath72 figure  1 shows the magnitude @xmath73 of the corresponding gauge field , obtained by solving ( [ piii_1 ] ) numerically .",
    "we see that the gauge field is peaked at @xmath65 , and has a radius of order unity ; it is in effect abelian , and so we can use green s theorem to compute @xmath74 .     and the gauge field @xmath73 for the @xmath4 solution .",
    "[ fig1 ] ]    outside the core region around @xmath65 , there is an approximation to the field , or ` limiting configuration ' @xcite , which turns out to be a useful one : namely @xmath75 here the square root is branched along the negative @xmath76-axis , where the gauge potential has a delta - function singularity .",
    "the corresponding gauge field @xmath24 is supported at @xmath65 : in fact , it is a 2-dimensional delta - function @xmath77 .",
    "the branch discontinuity is gauge - removable , but the singularity at @xmath65 is not . for a given @xmath9 as in ( [ 1-lump_approx ] ) ,",
    "the gauge field could instead be proportional to @xmath78 , so there is an angle @xmath79 associated with the lump . in the @xmath4 case , this angle is gauge - removable ; but for @xmath80 the relative phase between lumps plays a role , as shall see below .",
    "the general form of @xmath25 is @xmath81 , and the singular approximation generalizing ( [ 1-lump_approx ] ) , namely @xmath82 , can be used to determine which of the coefficients @xmath48 are moduli .",
    "the convergence of ( [ l2norm ] ) is determined by the asymptotic behaviour of the fields as @xmath83 , and the singular approximation is a good one in this asymptotic region .",
    "the @xmath3 norm of the derivative @xmath84 , for the singular field , is @xmath85 assuming that the zeros of @xmath8 are simple , this integral converges if and only if @xmath86 lies in the range @xmath87 .",
    "so for these values of @xmath86 , the coefficient @xmath48 is a complex modulus .",
    "in particular , the @xmath4 and @xmath5 cases do not admit moduli , whereas for @xmath2 we do get moduli .",
    "in addition to the coefficients @xmath48 , there are other moduli : these are the relative phases between the @xmath1  lumps . if  @xmath1 is odd , then @xmath88 of the coefficients @xmath48 are complex moduli , which together with @xmath89 relative phases gives a total of @xmath90 real moduli . if  @xmath1 is even , then @xmath91 of the coefficients are complex moduli . in this case , there are @xmath89 relative phases , but one combination of them does not have @xmath3 variation , so we end up with a total of @xmath92 real moduli in the even case . in particular , the @xmath6 and @xmath93 cases each have a 4-dimensional moduli space @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath62-invariant fields are exactly those for which the lumps are parallel or antiparallel , in other words the relative phases are @xmath94 or @xmath95 .",
    "this may be understood in the gauge ( [ psi - form ] , [ a - form ] ) , as follows .",
    "let @xmath96 denote the roots of @xmath25 .",
    "then the relative phase between the lump at @xmath97 and the one at @xmath98 is the angle in @xmath15 between the gauge fields @xmath99 and @xmath100 at these two points . to make sense of this",
    ", we have to specify how to compare the isovectors @xmath24 at the two points .",
    "but for @xmath62-invariant fields we have @xmath45 in ( [ a - form ] ) , and then parallel - propagation between the two points does not change @xmath24 at all ; so we conclude that @xmath99 and @xmath100 , both being in the @xmath35-direction , are either parallel or antiparallel .",
    "we now examine some features of the @xmath5 case .",
    "let @xmath101 denote the set of solutions which are invariant under @xmath62 , up to gauge .",
    "then @xmath102 has two components , namely @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 are parallel , and @xmath106 where they are antiparallel .",
    "let @xmath107 denote the space of rotationally - symmetric fields .",
    "then @xmath108 has the two gauge fields cancelling : indeed , it is the explicit degenerate solution @xmath109 the set @xmath107 of rotationally - symmetric solutions is a 1-parameter family of fields interpolating between ( [ explicit2 ] ) and the non - explicit field @xmath110 .",
    "this family can be obtained as solutions of a boundary - value problem for a single real - valued function , as follows .",
    "we work in the gauge ( [ psi - form ] , [ a - form ] ) , with @xmath111 and @xmath67 . in the @xmath5 case ,",
    "the rotational - symmetry condition becomes @xmath68 and @xmath112 .",
    "then the general solution of equation ( [ alpha - eqn ] ) is @xmath113 , where @xmath114 are real constants and @xmath115 now the boundary condition @xmath22 as @xmath83 implies that @xmath116 , so we end up with an expression for @xmath41 in terms of @xmath117 and the real constant @xmath118 , namely @xmath119 .",
    "this can then be substituted into ( [ psi - eqn ] ) to give an equation for @xmath117 , namely @xmath120      ( r^4{{\\mathrm{e}}}^{\\psi}-{{\\mathrm{e}}}^{-\\psi } ) . \\ ] ] the boundary conditions on @xmath39 are @xmath121 and @xmath122 as @xmath83 . in the @xmath123 case ( where @xmath45 )",
    ", it is again a painlev - iii equation , but with a different parameter .",
    "its nature for general @xmath124 might be worth investigating , for example via a painlev analysis .     for a rotationally - symmetric @xmath5 field with @xmath123 ; and @xmath125 as a function of @xmath124 .",
    "[ fig2 ] ]    for each value of @xmath126 , we get a rotationally - symmetric solution , and this family is illustrated in figure  2 .",
    "the left - hand plot is the @xmath123 case , and shows the norm @xmath127 of the gauge field as a function of @xmath76 and @xmath128 ; this was obtained by solving ( [ psi - eqn ] ) numerically with @xmath45 .",
    "the field @xmath127 is peaked on a circle centred at @xmath65 , and @xmath129 .",
    "the right - hand diagram shows the result of solving the boundary - value problem ( [ rotsym2 ] ) numerically , and plots @xmath125 as a function of @xmath124 .",
    "the limit @xmath130 is the degenerate solution ( [ explicit2 ] ) where @xmath131 , whereas @xmath123 is the solution depicted in the left - hand plot .",
    "if @xmath6 , then @xmath25 has the form @xmath132 . the constants @xmath133 and @xmath134 are complex parameters , whereas @xmath135 is a complex modulus . by translation of @xmath20",
    ", we may set @xmath136 .",
    "we can also use a rotation to make @xmath134 real .",
    "this leaves us with @xmath137 where @xmath138 is a fixed parameter , and @xmath139 is a complex modulus . for each value of @xmath140",
    ", we have a 4-dimensional moduli space @xmath141 , on which the local coordinates are the real and imaginary parts of @xmath139 together with two relative phases @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "note that @xmath144 admits a rotational killing vector , since @xmath145 is then an isometry .",
    "the asymptotic region of @xmath141 is where @xmath146 , and in this region the singular approximation @xmath82 is a good one @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is that the lumps become smaller as they separate , _ ie .",
    "_  as @xmath147 .",
    "for example , if @xmath148 , then @xmath149 near @xmath150 , and so the lump at @xmath150 has characteristic size @xmath151 , and in effect it approaches a delta - function as @xmath152 .",
    "so the singular approximation is an accurate one in the asymptotic region of @xmath11 where the zeros of @xmath25 are well - separated .",
    "let @xmath153 denote the zeros of ( [ h3poly ] ) .",
    "the gauge field near @xmath97 has the approximate form @xmath154\\,\\delta(z - z_j).\\ ] ] this gives us three angles @xmath155 in the @xmath156-plane , and hence two relative angles , say @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "the asymptotic moduli are @xmath139 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 , and the structure is that of a @xmath159-bundle over the @xmath139-space , with @xmath160 $ ] being the @xmath159 coordinates . this bundle is twisted : if the phase of @xmath139 goes from @xmath94 to @xmath161 , thereby permuting the zeros of @xmath25 , then the angles @xmath162 are transformed by an element @xmath163 of the modular group sl(2,@xmath164 ) , namely @xmath165 in fact , @xmath163 is a cube root of unity in sl(2,@xmath164 ) .",
    "one may now calculate the asymptotic metric on the moduli space from the integral formula ( [ l2norm ] ) , by using the singular approximation .",
    "the calculation is analogous to that described in @xcite , and will only be sketched here . for large @xmath166 , the parameter @xmath140 may be ignored , and so the singular approximation is @xmath167 . differentiating this with respect to @xmath139",
    "gives a vector @xmath168 , and its norm is @xmath169 .",
    "the structure of the perturbation equations ( [ perteqns ] ) enables us to write down three other vectors @xmath170 , giving an orthogonal tetrad @xmath171 of vectors all having the same norm .",
    "for each of the @xmath172 , we can compute the corresponding change in the coordinates @xmath173 .",
    "this then gives us a coordinate expression for the metric , which turns out to be @xmath174 where @xmath175 this",
    "metric is flat , with a conical singularity at @xmath176 .",
    "it is of type alg @xcite , since the 4-volume of a ball with geodesic radius @xmath177 is proportional to @xmath178 for large @xmath179 .",
    "it is invariant under the modular transformation @xmath163 , and therefore well - defined .",
    "now @xmath180 is an isometry , and so the subset @xmath181 of @xmath62-invariant fields is a 2-dimensional totally - geodesic submanifold of @xmath141 . in what follows ,",
    "we study the geometry of this surface @xmath102 .",
    "now @xmath102 has two components : one of them is @xmath103 , where the three lumps are parallel ( @xmath182 ) ; and the other is @xmath106 , where two lumps are parallel and the third is antiparallel to them .",
    "let us first consider @xmath103 , which is diffeomorphic to @xmath0 and has @xmath139 as a global complex coordinate .",
    "the induced metric on @xmath103 has the form @xmath183 . from ( [ singmetric ] )",
    "we expect that @xmath184 as @xmath185 .",
    "in fact , @xmath186 is a cone , and so @xmath103 is this cone with its vertex smoothed .    a numerical calculation can be used to obtain information about the geometry of @xmath103 in its central region .",
    "the procedure is as follows : solve ( [ psi - eqn ] ) with @xmath45 numerically , for a range of values of @xmath139 ; obtain tangent vectors @xmath187 by evaluating the difference in the fields for neighbouring values of @xmath139 and then projecting orthogonal to the gauge orbits ; evaluate the integral ( [ l2norm ] ) to calculate @xmath188 ; and finally compute the gaussian curvature @xmath189 from @xmath188 .",
    "this numerical procedure gives results that are consistent with the expected asymptotic form : for example , in the case @xmath190 one finds @xmath191 when @xmath192 .",
    "the results are illustrated in figure  3 , which plots the curvature @xmath189 versus @xmath139 , for two values of the parameter @xmath140 .",
    "of @xmath103 , for @xmath190 and @xmath193.[fig3 ] ]    the left - hand plot is for @xmath190 , and is rotationally - symmetric as expected .",
    "the right - hand one is for @xmath193 , and we see that the curvature is peaked at two points : these are the values @xmath194 for which the polynomial @xmath25 has a double root , which means that two of the three lumps coincide .    , for @xmath190 and @xmath193.[fig4 ] ]    next we do the same thing for the other component @xmath106 .",
    "the surface @xmath106 is a triple cover of the @xmath139-plane , since any one of the three lumps can be the odd one out ( antiparallel to the other two ) .",
    "indeed , @xmath106 has a global complex coordinate @xmath195 , where @xmath196 .",
    "repeating the procedure described above leads to figure  4 . in this case , the gaussian curvaure @xmath189 is ( predominantly ) negative , and @xmath197 is plotted .",
    "once again the @xmath190 case is rotationally - symmetric , while in the @xmath193 case the curvature has four peaks .",
    "there are two values of @xmath195 , and hence @xmath139 , for which a lump concides with the antilump , leaving only a single lump in @xmath0 ; the curvature is negative at these values of @xmath195 ( in the right - hand plot of figure  4 , this is at @xmath198 ) .",
    "and there are two values of @xmath195 for which the two parallel lumps coincide ; the curvature is positive at those values ( @xmath199 in figure  4 ) .",
    "the picture therefore is that the moduli space @xmath141 has an asymptotically - conical geometry ; the vertices of this cone , which are located at the values of @xmath139 for which @xmath21 has coincident zeros , are smoothed out , and the curvature of @xmath141 is concentrated at these loci .",
    "the natural energy functional for the hitchin system , arising as a dimensional reduction of the yang - mills action in @xmath200 , is @xmath201|^2\\right)\\,dx^1\\,dx^2.\\ ] ] solutions of the hitchin equations ( [ h1 ] ) are critical popints of ( [ energy ] ) .",
    "however , for the soliton - like solutions described in this paper , the integral ( [ energy ] ) diverges , on account of the @xmath202 term .",
    "one could try to regularize the integral by subtracting a fixed function from the integrand , in other words one that does not depend on the moduli .",
    "but a calculation with the approximate solution quickly shows that this does not work : a moduli - dependent part remains which is at least logarithmically divergent .",
    "so it remains unclear as to whether the energy ( [ energy ] ) can be regularized in a satisfactory way .",
    "the information which determines a solution may also be understood in terms of spectral data , consisting of a bundle over a spectral curve , which is the zero - set of @xmath203 . in the su(2 ) case with @xmath6 described above , the spectral curve is the standard elliptic curve @xmath204 .",
    "the spectral data are preserved under the generalized nahm transform .",
    "the details of this transform depend on the boundary conditions being imposed , and several different examples of nahm transforms applied to the hitchin equations have been studied @xcite .    in this paper , we have only considered one particular moduli space , namely that of smooth @xmath6 solutions with gauge group su(2 ) .",
    "the same sort of methods can readily be applied to other cases , where @xmath1 and the gauge group are different and where one allows singularities .",
    "one would expect there to be isometries between some of the resulting moduli spaces ; a first step would be to classify these spaces up to isometry , using the nahm transform , along the lines of what was done for doubly - periodic monopoles @xcite .",
