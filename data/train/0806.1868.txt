    "we are in the year following the momentous announcement of experimental evidence for @xmath1-@xmath3 mixing  .-@xmath3 mixing as ` charm mixing ' or simply ` @xmath1 mixing ' . ] the time elapsed from the discovery of the charm degree of freedom was long ( more than thirty years ) . from my own perspective",
    ", things really began to take off on the experimental side with the large fixed target experiments e687 and e791 in the 1990 s .",
    "then the announcement by focus of a much larger than expected width difference ( @xmath4 ) created a buzz in the field .",
    "finally in 2007 we saw the positive results of the b - factory experiments babar and belle ( followed by cdf ) . in the next section ,",
    "i review the latest findings and discuss what lessons they teach us .",
    "let us consider four points regarding the current experimental situation as summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite .    1 .",
    "_ experimental evidence for charm mixing has improved_. at the charm 2007 workshop ( cornell university 8/5/07 - 8/8/07 ) the euphoria of the moment provoked me to point out  @xcite that in light of the physical review letters criteria of ` observation ' ( @xmath5 ) or ` evidence ' ( @xmath6-to-@xmath7 ) , the then - existing @xmath8 determination of @xmath9 amounted to merely a ` measurement ' ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the current values ( for the ` no cp - violation ' fit ) @xmath11 are at the level of ` evidence ' , and indeed in a plot of @xmath12 , the point @xmath13 is excluded by @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "the current data set contains no evidence for cp - violation ( hereafter cpv ) in charm mixing_. we will consider the corresponding situation for charm decays in sect .",
    "3 .   _ weeding out theoretical descriptions _ :",
    "due to the heretofore uncertain status of charm mixing , i have been reluctant to discard various theoretical descriptions . however , in view of the @xmath15 c.l .",
    "values in the cpv - allowed fit to charm mixing , @xmath16 for @xmath17 and @xmath18 for @xmath19 , i now feel that models having @xmath20 are no longer tenable .",
    "the strong phase @xmath21 is not ` very large'_. the no - cpv determination yields @xmath22 whereas in the cpv - allowed fit the @xmath15 c.l .",
    "values are @xmath23 for @xmath24 .",
    "this developing topic is detailed in the following subsection .      in the field of charm mixing , the ` strong phase ' is defined as the relative phase between the @xmath25 and @xmath26 decay amplitudes .",
    "it appears in wrong - sign @xmath1 transitions because the @xmath27 final state occurs both via doubly cabibbo suppressed ( dcs ) decays and @xmath1 mixing followed by a cabibbo favored ( cf ) decay . as a consequence , the parameters @xmath28 appear in the analysis . in the world of flavor su(3 ) invariance , one has @xmath29 .    there is no way to completely avoid the presence of @xmath21 .",
    "for example , the time dependent rate for wrong - sign events in @xmath1 decay , @xmath30 depends explicitly on @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "there is no fundamental physics in @xmath21 ; it is a detail of the strong interactions . from the viewpoint of electroweak physics ( and more specifically of charm mixing )",
    ", it is an irritant , a nuisance .",
    "let me briefly review two rather different theoretical attempts to determine @xmath21 .",
    "although neither is a first - principles application of qcd , both are well thought - out calculations .    1 .",
    "_ nearby resonances _ : in ref .",
    "@xcite , the cf and dcs amplitudes , respectively called @xmath33 and @xmath34 , are each expressed as a sum of tree and resonance contributions .",
    "the latter involves the weak transition of the initial @xmath1 into a resonance @xmath35 whose mass is nearby that of the @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath35 propagates and then decays strongly into the final state .",
    "the relative phase between tree and resonance components arises from the phase @xmath36 of the @xmath35 propagator , @xmath37 straightforward algebra then relates the strong phase @xmath21 to the resonance phase @xmath36 . in view of the vanishing of @xmath21 in the su(3 ) limit , it is convenient to plot @xmath38 as a function of an su(3)-breaking parameter @xmath39 , @xmath40 at the time ref .",
    "@xcite was written , one had @xmath41 .",
    "this led to speculation among some that @xmath21 was quite large , although the large uncertainty in @xmath39 allows no such conclusion .",
    "a more recent evaluation gives @xmath42 .",
    "the uncertainty is now rather smaller and so is the central value .",
    "phenomenological @xmath43 analysis _ : in ref .",
    "@xcite , a study of seven cf and dcs @xmath44 modes is carried out in a model based on a traditional factorization and quark diagram approach .",
    "su(3 ) breaking is incorporated largely via the decay constants @xmath45 and @xmath46 . a formula for @xmath47",
    "is derived in terms of the branching ratios @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .    from the above two models",
    ", we should not be suprised to find @xmath51 ( both approaches predict only the magnitude @xmath52 ) .",
    "in other words , the strong phase is not expected to be ` very large ' , a result in accord with the phenomenological analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite ( whose determinaton gives a result consistent with zero ) .",
    "there has been recent progress in measuring @xmath21 experimentally .",
    "consider the reaction chain  @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 refers to some final state .",
    "the @xmath55 pair will have @xmath56 .",
    "define the cp eigenstates @xmath57 the approach under discussion has the two remarkable features of emphasizing quantum correlations and of directly involving the cp - eigenstates .",
    "the transition rate for producing the final state @xmath54 obeys @xmath58 the minus sign ( since @xmath59 ) in the first of the rate equations is due to the quantum nature of the process and the second of the rate equations exhibits the explicit presence of the cp - eigenstates @xmath60 .",
    "not all final states @xmath54 are optimal for determining the strong phase .",
    "it is best to choose one of the final states as a cp eigenstate @xmath61 and the other a @xmath62 pair , _",
    "e.g. _ as in @xmath63 where the dependence on @xmath21 is explicit .",
    "measurements based on this approach are presented in refs .  , which give @xmath64 .",
    "by further including external measurements of charm mixing parameters , an alternate measurement of @xmath47 is obtained , yielding @xmath65 .",
    "presumably , future experimental studies will be able to reduce present uncertainties , _",
    "e.g. _ for a discussion of measuring the strong phase at bes - iii see ref .  @xcite .",
    "in principle , charm mixing can arise from the standard model ( sm ) and/or from new physics ( np ) .",
    "we shall cover both in this talk , but consider the np possibility in greater detail .",
    "theoretical estimates of charm mixing have been performed using either quark or hadron degrees of freedom .",
    "we shall discuss each of these in turn .",
    "to my knowledge , the earliest attempt of this type is continaed in ref .",
    "these days , the usual approach ( like that used in @xmath66 mixing ) is to express the mixing matrix element as a sum of local operators ordered according to dimension ( operator product expansion or simply ope )  @xcite . at a given order in the ope , the mixing amplitude is expanded in qcd perturbation theory .",
    "finally matrix elements of the various local operators are determined .",
    "it is a peculiarity of charm mixing that the various mixing amplitudes are most conveniently characterized by expanding in the small parameter @xmath67 .",
    "a full implementation of this program is daunting because the number of local operators increases sharply with the operator dimension @xmath68 ( _ e.g. _ @xmath69 has two operators , @xmath70 has fifteen , and so on )  @xcite .",
    "the matrix elements of the various local operators are unknown and can be only roughly approximated in model calculations . in principle , qcd lattice determinations would be of great use , but they are not generally available at this time  @xcite .",
    "an analysis of @xmath9 and @xmath71 in the leading order @xmath69 in the ope has been carried out through @xmath72 in ref .",
    "the result through @xmath72 is @xmath73 .",
    "these small values are due in part to severe flavor cancellations ( the leading terms in the @xmath74-expansion for @xmath9 and @xmath71 respectively are @xmath75 and @xmath76 at order @xmath77 and @xmath75 and @xmath76 at order @xmath78 .    evidently , the quark approach as implemented via the ope has been seen as _ not _ the way to understand charm mixing .",
    "it involves a triple expansion ( in operator dimension @xmath68 , qcd coupling @xmath79 and parameter @xmath74 ) which is at best slowly convergent .",
    "one long - standing beacon of hope has been the suggestion in ref .",
    "@xcite that six - quark operators whose wilson coefficients suffer only one power of @xmath74 suppression might give rise to @xmath80 . even this effect ( whose estimated size is problematic due to uncertainties in matrix element evaluation ) is too small .",
    "let us restrict our attention to the following exact relation for the width difference @xmath81 where @xmath82 we can calculate @xmath71 by inserting intermediate states between the @xmath83 weak hamiltonian densities @xmath84 .",
    "of course , knowledge of the matrix elements @xmath85 is required .",
    "this method yielded an entirely reasonable estimate for @xmath86 , where the number of large matrix elements turns out to be quite limited  @xcite .",
    "by contrast , for charm mixing the number of contributing matrix elements is quite large.perhaps the most comprehensive analysis to date for charm is the phenomenological evaluation based on factorization given in ref .",
    "the result @xmath87 thus obtained is too small .",
    "this unfortunate circumstance shows how delicate this sum over many contributions seems to be .",
    "what then is one to do , given that the hadron approach appears tied to the issue of matrix element evaluation ?",
    "perhaps it is best to rely more on charm decay data and less on the underlying theory . the earliest work of this type  @xcite focussed on the @xmath88 intermediate states in eq .",
    "( [ had1 ] ) . in the flavor su(3 )",
    "limit , exact cancellations reduce the contribution from this subset of states to zero .",
    "however , su(3 ) breaking was already known to be significant in individual charm decays , and based on data available at that time , these references concluded that ` @xmath71 might be large ' .",
    "a modern version of this approach exists  @xcite , but with the above argument essentially turned on its head .",
    "a main new ingredient is the realization that su(3 ) breaking occurs at second order in charm mixing  @xcite .",
    "can it be that all two - particle and three - particle sectors ( such as @xmath89 ) contribute very little to charm mixing due to flavor cancellations ?",
    "perhaps , but this argument can not be continued to the four - particle intermediate states because decay into four - kaon states is kinematically forbidden . in fact , ref .",
    "@xcite claims that these very sectors can generate @xmath90 .",
    "a dispersion relation calculation using charm decay widths as input can be used to estimate @xmath9 , but this contains an additional layer of model dependence .",
    "i believe the claim that sm contributions produce values for @xmath9 and @xmath71 at the @xmath91 level is not unreasonable . at the same time , however , compared to sm predictions for kaon , @xmath92 and @xmath93 mixing , the status of charm mixing is decidely ` fuzzy ' .",
    "the lhc era is about to begin .",
    "yet , what we will learn from lhc data is still highly uncertain .",
    "this is in stark contrast with sm expectations at the time lep came on line .",
    "our own recent work on @xmath9 has tried to be bias - free by allowing for a variety of extensions to the standard model  @xcite ,    1 ] extra gauge bosons ( lr models , _ etc _ )    2 ] extra scalars ( multi - higgs models , _ etc _ )    3 ] extra fermions ( little higgs models , _ etc _ )    4 ] extra dimensions ( split fermion models , _ etc _ )    5 ] extra global symmetries ( susy , _ etc _ ) .",
    "np contributions to charm mixing can affect @xmath71 as well as @xmath9 .",
    "we do not consider the former in this talk , but instead refer the reader to refs .  .",
    "the strategy for calculating the effect of np on @xmath1 mixing is , for the most part , straightforward .",
    "one considers a particular np model and calculates the mixing amplitude for as a function of the model parameters .",
    "if the mixing signal is sufficiently large , constraints on the parameters are obtained .",
    "for all we know , the observed @xmath1 mixing signal is a product of both sm _ and _ np contributions .",
    "in general we will not know the relative phase between the sm and np amplitudes , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : smnp ] , or even the precise value of the ` fuzzy ' sm component .",
    "this affects how np constraints are treated , as shown later in a specific example .",
    "we now turn to the issue of np and @xmath9 , as based on the work in ref .",
    "@xcite , which studied a total of 21 np models .",
    "these are listed in table  [ tab : bigtable ] .",
    ".np models studied in ref .",
    "@xcite [ cols=\"^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : asymm ]    i leave it to the reader to study the various technical details present in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , some general patterns of expected np behavior are :    1",
    ".   some supersymmetric models can give @xmath94 whereas models with minimal flavor violation can not .",
    "2 .   only the scs decays probe gluonic penguin amplitudes .",
    "thus any large cpv asymmetries arising from this source would be unlikely for cf and dcs decays .",
    "cpv asymmetries as large as @xmath95 would be expected from np theories which contribute via loop amplitudes but not tree amplitudes ( tree amplitudes tend to be constrained by @xmath1 mixing constraints ) .",
    "as we enter the lhc era , our field will require the resources to pursue both _ discovery _ and _ precision _ options .",
    "the discovery option will be carried out at the lhc .",
    "if , as anticipated , new physics is revealed , perhaps ( i ) the signature will be so striking that a specific np model is clearly identified , or ( ii ) the situation will be unclear for quite some time ( _ e.g. _ some of the np degrees of freedom might remain beyond the lhc reach ) . in either case",
    ", it will be important to carry out the precision option .",
    "for the case ( i ) above , we need to check and verify the lhc results , whereas for case ( ii ) observing the pattern of rare effects should help clarify the lhc findings",
    ". this will require the participation of lhc - b and @xmath96 super - flavor factories .",
    "how many such facilities will become operable only time will tell .",
    "one can only hope . now onto a summary of the main topics :      the data on @xmath1 mixing allow us at long last to claim ( in the sense of prl discovery criteria ) ` evidence ' for determinations of @xmath97 and a true ` observation ' of mixing .",
    "the quality of the mixing signal now can rule out theoretical descriptions predicting charm mixing at the @xmath98 level .",
    "there has been real progress on the issue of the strong phase difference @xmath21 between the @xmath26 and @xmath25 amplitudes .",
    "we expect that improved sensitivity in the quantum correlation approach will provide a more accurate measure of @xmath21 .",
    "there is little change in our previous understanding of this subject .",
    "the quark approach which is carried out in the ope has , to date , yielded @xmath99 .",
    "even the most optimistic prediction for using this method predicts a mixing signal an order of magnitude too small .",
    "we have here a very slowly convergent process which nobody has yet been able to conquer .",
    "more promising is the hadron approach which might in fact get the magnitudes @xmath100 right , but is hampered by theoretical uncertainties .",
    "nonetheless , we are still able to conclude that the observed @xmath1 mixing might well be a consequence of sm physics .      the comprehensive study in ref .",
    "@xcite of 21 possible np contributions to charm mixing shows that the observed @xmath1 mixing might also well be a consequence of beyond - sm physics ! further progress on this front",
    "will presumably require input from lhc data for selecting among np possibilities .",
    "we have pointed out how the inter - related phenomenologies of charm mixing and rare charm decays allows for a more systematic probe of np parameter spaces .      with the observation of charm mixing ,",
    "the study of cp - violations in charm has taken its place at the forefront of research in this field . given the expectation that cp - violating sm asymmetries should be less than @xmath101 and that some np models can exceed this value",
    ", there should be a real window of opportunity to aim at .",
    "however , this window has begun to close .",
    "one is left wondering as usual  where is the new physics ?",
    "this work was supported in part by the u.s .",
