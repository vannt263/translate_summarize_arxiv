    "an opaque set ( or a barrier ) for @xmath0 is a set @xmath7 such that any line intersecting @xmath2 also intersects @xmath1 .",
    "a simple example is that given any geometric shape ( e.g. , square , triangle , and so on ) , its boundary forms a barrier .",
    "note that we do not assume @xmath1 is contained in @xmath2 .",
    "a barrier is called _ rectifiable _ if it is a union of countably many finite - length curves which are pairwise disjoint with each other except at the endpoints .",
    "the problem considered in this paper is to minimize the length of rectifiable barriers , that is , what is the shortest barrier for given @xmath2 ?",
    "this problem is so classic , which is first posed by mazurkiewicz in 1916  @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , even for simple polygons such as squares or triangles , the length of the shortest barrier is still not identified .",
    "currently , only lower bounds , which are probably not tight , are known : a general lower bound has been shown by jones in 1964  @xcite , which proves that the shortest barrier for any convex polygon must be longer than the half of its perimeter .",
    "that is , the shortest barrier for the unit - size square must be at least two , and for the unit - size equilateral triangle it must be at least @xmath3 . after that , the problem was revived in several times  @xcite , and there are a number of papers considering its algorithmic aspects  @xcite .",
    "this paper focuses more on the mathematical aspect : we argue explicit lower bounds for a specific shape @xmath2 .    for explicit lower bounds beyond jones one ,",
    "very recently , two papers propose improved lower bounds for squares  @xcite .",
    "the result by @xcite is conditional , which assumes that any segment in the barrier is not so far from the boundary of the square .",
    "the paper by kawamura et al .",
    "@xcite gives an unconditional lower bound of @xmath8 for the unit - size square .",
    "furthermore , they show that any ( possibly non - regular ) convex @xmath4-gon for @xmath9 whose perimeter is @xmath10 , there exists a constant @xmath11 such that @xmath12 becomes a lower bound for the barrier . unfortunately , this result assumes @xmath9 and thus does not cover triangles .",
    "the best known lower bound for the unit - size equilateral triangle is still @xmath3 . in this paper",
    ", we improve this lower bound by a small constant .",
    "more precisely , we obtain the lower bound of length @xmath6 . while it is still far from the currently best barrier @xmath13 with length @xmath14 ( figure  [ fig : conjecture ] ) , which is conjectured to be optimal ,",
    "this result is the first nontrivial improvement of jones bound for equilateral triangles .",
    "the following part of the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : preliminaries ] , we state several notations and our proof ideas , which include the proof of jones bound .",
    "our proof is divided into two subcases .",
    "section  [ sec : bound6 ] and [ sec : bound3 ] correspond to those cases , and they are integrated in section  [ sec : boundgeneral ] .",
    "finally , we conclude this paper in section  [ sec : concludingremarks ] .",
    "( bold lines ) conjectured to be optimal.,width=226 ]",
    "throughout this paper , we use the term `` equilateral triangle '' as the meaning of `` unit - size equilateral triangle '' .",
    "we assume that any barrier @xmath1 considered in this paper is a straight barrier , and thus regard @xmath1 as a ( possibly infinite ) set of segments .",
    "note that this assumption not essential : by kawamura et al .",
    "@xcite , it is shown that getting a lower bound for straight barriers implies getting the same bound for general ( unconditional ) barriers . for @xmath15 , we define @xmath16 as the image of @xmath17 projected onto the line with angle @xmath18 passing the origin .",
    "precisely , @xmath19 .",
    "for any set @xmath17 of segments , we denote by @xmath20 the sum of the length of all the segments in @xmath17 , and denote by @xmath21 the sum of the length of the segments constituting the image @xmath22 .",
    "we have the following necessary condition : @xmath23 : |u(\\alpha)| \\leq |b(\\alpha)| \\leq   \\sum_{l \\in b } |l(\\alpha)| \\label{eq : necessarycondition}\\ ] ] that is , for any angle @xmath24 , the projection of @xmath2 must be covered by the projection of @xmath1 .",
    "otherwise , @xmath1 can not be a barrier because there exists a line orthogonal to the plane with angle @xmath18 intersecting @xmath2 but not intersecting @xmath1 .",
    "we call this inequality the _ projection - cover condition _ for @xmath18",
    ".    the bound by jones  @xcite is obtained by summing up the projection - cover condition for all @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "@xmath26    where @xmath27 is the perimeter of @xmath2 . in the case that @xmath2 is the equilateral triangle , @xmath28 . note that the first equality is obtained by cauthy s surface area formula .",
    "our lower bound proof is based on two new ideas .",
    "the first one is to consider _ angle - restricted _ barriers : letting @xmath29 $ ] , we say that @xmath1 is @xmath30-restricted if any segment @xmath31 has an angle in @xmath30 .",
    "given an @xmath30-restricted barrier and an angle @xmath32 , we denote the set of segments in @xmath1 with angle @xmath33 by @xmath34 .",
    "the next idea is an extension of jones bound to obtain better bounds for angle - restricted barriers .",
    "the key observation behind the extension is an interpretation of jones bound in the context of linear programming .",
    "let @xmath2 be a convex polygon , @xmath35 be the set of lines with angle @xmath36 intersecting @xmath2 , and @xmath37 .",
    "now we define any segment by their two endpoints , that is , we regards a segment as an element in @xmath38 .",
    "the length of a segment @xmath39 is denoted by @xmath40 . for segment @xmath39 , we also define a @xmath41-@xmath42 variable @xmath43 . letting @xmath44",
    "be the set of segments intersecting a line @xmath45 , the constraint that the line @xmath46 is `` blocked '' by some segment is described by @xmath47 .",
    "that is , we have an integer - programming formulation for the shortest barrier problem : @xmath48 now we sum up the constraints for all @xmath49 .",
    "since the number of lines with angle @xmath36 intersecting to a geometric shape @xmath50 is proportional to the volume of the projection @xmath51 , the number of appearance for variable @xmath43 in the left side of the summation is proportional to @xmath52 .",
    "similarly the right - side value is proportional to @xmath53 .",
    "consequently , we can write the summation as follows : @xmath54",
    "interestingly , when we fix a barrier ( i.e. , variable assignments ) the inequality above is equivalent to the projection - cover condition for angle @xmath18 , and thus summing up all constraints for @xmath55 consists in jones bound .",
    "the implication of this observation is that jones bound can be seen as a construction of a dual solution for the lp relaxation of the above ip , i.e. , @xmath56 is a feasible dual solution ( where @xmath57 is a all - one vector ) .",
    "this interpretation yields a natural question : can we construct a better dual solution for improving lower bounds ?",
    "if we can construct such a solution for the dual lp , it implies a better lower bound for the shortest barrier .",
    "unfortunately , this approach fails because the integrality gap of the lp relaxation is not sufficiently small to improve jone s bound : actually , there exists a fractional ( more precisely , half - integral ) solution for that lp relaxation with the cost matching the jones bound  @xcite : letting @xmath17 be the set of segments forming the boundary of @xmath2 , and consider the value assignment setting @xmath58 for any @xmath59 .",
    "this is a feasible solution of the relaxed lp and the value of the objective function is obviously equal to the half of the perimeter .",
    "our approach for circumventing this issue is to utilize the lp - based argument to obtain the bound for @xmath60-restricted barriers .",
    "obviously , this class contains the barrier @xmath13 .",
    "that is , the upper bound for the shortest barrier in that class is @xmath14 .",
    "interestingly , for the ip formulation of finding the optimal of all @xmath60-restricted barriers , its lp relaxation exhibits an integrality gap arbitrarily close to one . that is , the conjecture shown in figure  [ fig : conjecture ] is the shortest barrier of all @xmath60-restricted barriers .",
    "the final step of our proof is a reduction : we show that most of barriers with length at most @xmath3 induce @xmath60-restricted barriers with length less than @xmath14 .",
    "thus we can eliminate the existence of such barriers .",
    "only the exception is the class of @xmath61-restricted barriers .",
    "any barrier of length @xmath3 in that class induces only @xmath60-restricted barriers of length @xmath14 , and thus we can not lead a contradiction . to resolve this exceptional case , we also provide an improved lower bound for @xmath61-restricted barriers based on the approach by kawamura et al .  @xcite . putting all results together ,",
    "we obtain a general lower bound strictly larger than @xmath3 .",
    "in what follows , let @xmath2 be the unit - size equilateral triangle .",
    "this section provides the optimal bound for @xmath62-restricted barriers for @xmath2 is @xmath14 .",
    "note that this restricted class contains the barrier @xmath13 conjectured to be optimal .",
    "that is , our proof implies that @xmath13 is the optimal barrier in that class . as we discussed in the previous section , the proof is based on the construction of a better dual solution for the ip / lp formulation of the shortest barrier problem .",
    "it can be interpreted as a `` weighted sum '' of projection - cover conditions .",
    "the core of the proof is to provide a nice weight function yielding the optimal bound .",
    "first , we identity the value of @xmath53 , which is described as follows : @xmath63    it is easy to verify the above description by figure  [ fig : triangleprojection ] .",
    "the case of @xmath64 is obtained by the symmetry of @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath1 be the optimal @xmath62-restricted barrier .",
    "then the right side of the projection - cover condition can be described as follows : @xmath65    now we introduce a function @xmath66 over @xmath67 $ ] , which is defined by another arbitrary function @xmath68 over @xmath69 $ ] : @xmath70    we use @xmath66 as a weight function . assuming @xmath66 is non - negative , the weighted sum of projection - cover conditions is stated as follows :    @xmath71    we look at the right side the above inequality .",
    "since @xmath66 is a periodic function of period @xmath72 , and @xmath73 for any @xmath74 $ ] is a periodic function of period @xmath75 , we have @xmath76 . then the inequality ( [ eq : weightedinequality ] )",
    "is simplified as follows : @xmath77    the remaining issue is to find the function @xmath68 maximizing the left side of the above inequality .",
    "we have the following lemma :    [ lma:6lowerbound ] letting @xmath78 and @xmath79 , @xmath80 that is , @xmath81 holds .",
    "just a calculation suffices .",
    "we add in the appendix the calculation result by mathematica so that readers can believe its correctness without spending their time .",
    "@xmath82     onto the line with angle @xmath18 ( @xmath83),width=453 ]",
    "this section considers lower bounds for the other extreme case , that is , @xmath61-restricted barriers . in this case , the proof relies on the lemma by kawamura et al .",
    "@xcite .",
