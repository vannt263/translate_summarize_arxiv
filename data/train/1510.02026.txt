    "the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) algorithm proposed by white @xcite to solve one - dimensional effective models in condensed matter theory has been established as a powerful method to tackle strongly correlated systems in quantum chemistry @xcite .",
    "in contrast to other active space methods such as casscf and casci , much larger active spaces can be treated .",
    "the original dmrg algorithm formulated by white is a variant of other renormalization group methods , relying on hilbert space decimation and reduced basis transformations . instead of truncating the eigenstates of the hamiltonian according to their energy , the selection of eigenstates based on their weight in reduced density matrices",
    "dramatically improved the performance for one - dimensional systems studied in condensed matter physics .",
    "an important contribution towards the present understanding of the algorithm was made by stlund and rommer @xcite , who showed that the block states in dmrg can be represented as matrix product states ( mps ) .",
    "they permitted predictions @xcite for the decay of the spectra of reduced density matrices via area laws @xcite for the entanglement entropy and by verstraete et al .",
    "@xcite , who derived the dmrg algorithm from a variational principle .    at first , mps were mainly a formal tool to study the properties of dmrg ; an application for numerical purposes was only considered for special cases , such as calculations under periodic boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "the usefulness of the matrix - product formalism for general applications was demonstrated by mcculloch @xcite and by crosswhite et al .",
    "@xcite who employed the concept of matrix product operators ( mpo ) to represent hamiltonian operators .",
    "mpos were previously introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite to calculate finite - temperature density matrices .",
    "the main advantage of mps is that they encode wave functions as stand - alone objects that can directly be manipulated arithmetically as a whole . in traditional dmrg by contrast , a series of reduced basis transformations entail a sequential dependency dictating when a certain part of the stored information becomes accessible .",
    "an mps - based algorithm may therefore process the information from independently computed wave functions .",
    "mcculloch @xcite exploited this fact to calculate excited states by orthogonalizing the solution of each local dmrg update against previously calculated lower lying states .",
    "this state - specific procedure converges excited states fast and avoids the performance penalty incured by a state - average approach , where all states must be represented in one common and consequently larger basis .",
    "we are not aware of any excited - state algorithm based on projecting out lower states in the context of traditional dmrg , but note that wouters et al .",
    "@xcite employed such an algorithm in the chemps2 dmrg program , which respresents the wave function as an mps , but employs a traditional operator format .",
    "we may refer to these traditional dmrg programs in quantum chemistry as first - generation programs and denote a truly mpo - based implementation of the dmrg algorithm a second - generation dmrg algorithm in quantum chemistry .",
    "such a second - generation formulation allows for more flexibility in finding the optimal state and allows for a wider range of applications . the possibility to store",
    "the wave function in the mps form allows us to perform ( complex ) measurements at a later time without the need to perform a full sweep through the system for the measurement .    in the mpo formalism",
    ", we can perform operator arithmetic , such as additions and multiplications .",
    "an example where this is useful is the calculation of the variance @xmath0 , requiring the expectation value of the squared hamiltonian . since the variance vanishes for an exact eigenstate",
    ", it is a valuable measure to assess the quality of dmrg wave functions , albeit of limited relevance for quantum chemistry , because quantum chemical dmrg calculations are limited by the size of the hamiltonian mpo , whose square is too expensive to evaluate for large systems . but apart from the possibility of operator arithmetic , the adoption of mpos for quantum chemical dmrg has additional advantages .",
    "the mpo structure inherently decouples the operator from core program routines performing operations on mps and mpos .",
    "the increased flexibility for hamiltonian operators , on the one hand , permitted us to implement both abelian and non - abelian symmetries with only one set of common contraction routines .",
    "we note , that the relativistic coulomb - dirac hamiltonian can also be solved by the same set of program routines , which we will describe in a later work .",
    "measuring observables , on the other hand , requires no additional effort ; only the locations of the elementary creation and annihilation operators need to be specified for a machinery capable of calculating expectation values of arbitrary mpss and mpos .",
    "the 26 different correlation functions required to calculate single- and two - site entropies @xcite , for example , can thus be specified as a program input .",
    "the algorithm that we develop in this work is implemented based on the alps mps program @xcite , which is a state - of - the - art mpo - based computer program applied in the condensed matter physics community . to its quantum chemical version presented in this work",
    "we refer to as qcmaquis .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in secs .",
    "[ sec : mps ] and [ sec : mpo ] we introduce the basic concepts of mps and mpo respectively .",
    "the inclusion of fermionic anticommutation is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : fermions ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : eval ] , we describe how mpos act on mpss .",
    "finally , we apply our implementation to the problem of two - dimensionally correlated electrons in graphene fragments in sec .",
    "[ sec : calculations ] .",
    "any state @xmath1 in a hilbert space spanned by @xmath2 spatial orbitals can be expressed in terms of its configuration interaction ( ci ) coefficients @xmath3 with respect to occupation number vectors @xmath4 . @xmath5 with @xmath6 . for mps ,",
    "the ci coefficients @xmath3 are encoded as the product of @xmath2 matrices @xmath7 , explicitly written as @xmath8 so that the quantum state reads @xmath9 collapsing the explicit summation over the @xmath10 indices in the previous equation as matrix - matrix multiplications , we obtain in compact form @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) are required to have matrix dimensions @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , respectively , as the above product of matrices must yield the scalar coefficient @xmath3 .",
    "the reason why eq .   is not simply a more complicated way of writing the ci expansion in eq .",
    "is that the dimension of the matrices @xmath13 may be limited to some maximum dimension @xmath19 , referred to as the number of renormalized block states @xcite .",
    "this restriction is the key idea that reduces the exponential growth of the original full - ci ( fci ) expansion to a polynomially scaling ansatz wave function . while the evaluation of all ci coefficients @xmath3 is still exponentially expensive , the ansatz in eq .   allows one to compute scalar products @xmath20 and expectation values @xmath21 of an operator @xmath22 in polynomial time as shown in section  [ sec : expectation_values ] . at the example of the norm calculation",
    "@xmath23 we observe that the operational complexity only reduces from exponential to polynomial , if we group the summations as @xmath24 in addition to limiting the matrix sizes .    the price to pay",
    ", however , is that such an omission of degrees of freedom leads to the introduction of interdependencies among the coefficients .",
    "fortunately , in molecular systems , even mps with a drastically limited number of @xmath19 accurately approximate ground and low - lying excited state energies ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for examples ) .",
    "moreover , mps are systematically improvable towards the fci limit by increasing @xmath19 and extrapolation techniques are available to estimate the distance to this limit for a simulation with finite @xmath19 .    despite the interesting properties of mps , eq",
    ".   might still not seem useful , as we have not discussed how the @xmath13 matrices can be constructed for some state in the form of eq .  .",
    "although the transformation from ci coefficients to the mps format is possible @xcite , it is of no practical relevance , because the resulting state would only be numerically manageable for small systems , where fci would be feasible as well  @xcite .",
    "dmrg calculations may , for instance , be started from a random  @xcite or from a state guess based on quantum informational criteria  @xcite .",
    "the lack of an efficient conversion to and from a ci expansion is therefore not a disadvantage of the mps ansatz .",
    "we also note that given an mps state , the most important ci coefficients can be reconstructed even for huge @xmath25 spaces  @xcite .",
    "mps that describe eigenstates of some given hamiltonian operator inherit the symmetries of the latter and the constitutent mps tensors @xmath7 therefore feature a block diagonal structure .",
    "examples of how block diagonal tensors can be exploited in numerical computations may be found in refs . @xcite and @xcite . for additional information about mps such as",
    "left and right normalization with singular value or qr decomposition we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite and to the detailed review by schollwck  @xcite .",
    "formally , the mps concept can be generalized to mpos .",
    "the coefficients @xmath26 of a general operator @xmath27   + may be encoded in matrix - product form as @xmath28 since we are mainly interested in operators corresponding to scalar observables , the two indices @xmath29 and @xmath30 are restricted to @xmath31 , such that we may later express the contraction over the @xmath32 indices again as matrix - matrix multiplications yielding a scalar sum of operator terms .    combining eqs .   and , the operator @xmath33 reads @xmath34 in contrast to the mps tensors @xmath13 in eq .  , the @xmath35 tensors in eq .",
    "each have an additional site index as superscript originating from the bra - ket notation in eq .  .",
    "to simplify eq .  , we perform a contraction over the local site indices @xmath36 in @xmath37 by defining @xmath38 so that eq",
    ".   reads @xmath39 the motivation for this change in notation is that the entries of the resulting @xmath40 matrices are the elementary operators acting on a single site , such as the creation and annihilation operators @xmath41 and @xmath42 . to see this , note that we may write , for instance ,",
    "@xmath43 which in practice can be represented as a @xmath44 matrix with two non - zero entries equal to @xmath31",
    ". hence , @xmath40 essentially collects all operators acting on site @xmath45 in matrix form . if we again recognize the summation over pairwise matching indices @xmath32 as matrix - matrix multiplications",
    ", we may drop them and rewrite eq .   as @xmath46    in practical applications one needs to find compact representations of operators corresponding to physical observables . for our purposes , the full electronic hamiltonian",
    ", @xmath47 is particularly important .",
    "the mpo formulation now allows us to arrange the creation and annihilation operators in eq .   into the operator valued matrices @xmath33 from eq .  .",
    "in the following , we present two ways to find such an arrangement .",
    "first , a very simple scheme is discussed to explain the basic concepts with a simple example .",
    "then , to obtain the same operational count as the dmrg in its traditional formulation , we describe in a second step , how the @xmath33 matrices can be constructed in an efficient implementation .",
    "we start by encoding the simplest term appearing in the electronic hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamil ] ) , @xmath48 , as an mpo @xmath49 . with the identity operator @xmath50 on sites @xmath51",
    ", we may write @xmath52 for simplicity , we neglected the inclusion of fermionic anticommutation , which will be discussed in section [ sec : fermions ] . to express this operator as an mpo",
    ", we need to find operator valued matrices @xmath53 , such that @xmath54 . in this case",
    ", there is only one elementary operator per site available .",
    "the only possible choice is therefore @xmath55 which recovers @xmath49 after multiplication .",
    "note that the coefficient @xmath56 could have been multiplied into any site and its indices are therefore not inherited to the @xmath57 notation . by substituting the identity operators in eq .   with elementary creation or annihilation operators at two additional sites",
    ", we can express two - electron terms as an mpo .",
    "while this changes the content of the @xmath58 matrices at those sites sites , their shape is left invariant .    turning to the mpo representation of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    ", we enumerate its terms in arbitrary order , such that we may write @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the @xmath61-th term of the hamiltonian in the format of eq .  .",
    "by introducing the site index @xmath62 , we can refer to the elementary operator on site @xmath62 of term @xmath61 by @xmath63 and generalize eq .   to @xmath64 the formula above states how a sum of an arbitrary number of terms can be encoded in matrix - product form .",
    "since all matrices are diagonal , except @xmath65 and @xmath66 which are row and column vectors respectively , the validity of @xmath67 is simple to verify .    as the number of terms in the hamiltonian operator is equal to the number of non - zero elements of each @xmath68 , the cost of applying the mpo on a single site scales as @xmath69 with respect to the number of sites , and hence the total operation of @xmath70 possesses a complexity of @xmath71 .",
    "this simple scheme of constructing the hamiltonian operator in matrix - product form thus leads to an increase in operational complexity by a factor of @xmath2 compared to the traditional formulation of the dmrg algorithm for the quantum chemical hamiltonian of eq .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is possible to optimize the hamiltonian mpo construction and reduce the operational count by a factor of @xmath2 .",
    "we elaborate on the ideas presented in refs . @xcite and @xcite , where identical subsequences among operator terms in the form of eq",
    ".   are exploited .",
    "if one considers tensor products as graphical connections between two sites , we can abstract the term in eq .   to a single string running through all sites .",
    "because of the nature of matrix - matrix multiplications , each element in column @xmath72 of @xmath68 will be multiplied by each element in row @xmath72 of @xmath73 in the product @xmath74 . in the naive representation in eq .   of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    ", operators were only placed on the diagonal , such that each matrix entry on site @xmath62 is multiplied by exactly one entry on site @xmath75 . in a connectivity diagram ,",
    "the construction discussed in the previous section therefore results in parallel strings , one per term , with no interconnections between them .",
    "the naive scheme may be improved in two different ways .",
    "first , if two or more strings are identical on sites @xmath31 through @xmath76 , they can be collapsed into one single substring up to site @xmath76 , which is then _ forked _ into new strings on site @xmath77 , splitting the common left part into the unique right remainders .",
    "this graphical analogy translates into placing local operators on site @xmath77 on the same row of the mpo matrix @xmath78 . because each operator on the site of the fork will be multiplied by the shared left part upon matrix - matrix multiplication , the same operator terms are obtained .",
    "the second option is to _ merge _ strings that match on sites @xmath45 through @xmath2 into a common right substring , which is realized if local operators on site @xmath79 of the strings to merge are placed on the same column in @xmath80 . if the hamiltonian operator in eq .",
    "is constructed in this fashion , there will also be strings with identical subsections in the middle of the lattice of sites .",
    "if we wanted to collapse , for instance , two of these shared substrings , we would first have to merge strings at the start of the matching subsection and subsequently fork on the right end .",
    "in general , however , it is not possible to collapse shared substrings in this manner , because each of the two strings to the left of the merge site will be multiplied by both forked strings on the right .",
    "four terms are thus obtained where there were initially only two . as an example , the mpo manipulation techniques discussed in this paragraph are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : mpoexample ] .",
    "we encoded the two terms @xmath81 and @xmath82 in an mpo according to the naive construction and subsequently applied _ fork _ and _ merge _ optimizations .     and",
    "@xmath82 are encoded in one mpo , whose matrices are depicted in the figure for the seven sites .",
    "the naive construction leads to the matrices shown in panel @xmath83 .",
    "optimization was carried out in panel @xmath84 to exploit the common operator on site @xmath31 .",
    "the combination of both _",
    "fork _ and _ merge _ optimizations yields panel @xmath85 .",
    "finally , the attempt to exploit the common identity operator on site @xmath86 in panel @xmath87 by introducing an additional _ fork _ and _ merge _ optimization fails , as unwanted cross terms are generated .",
    "we note that @xmath85 is only possible if both terms have the same matrix elements ( @xmath31 in this example ) . ]    to compact the @xmath88 matrices , we collapse strings from both sides of the orbital chain lattice simultaneously . starting from the naive construction of the hamiltonian operator ,",
    "each string is divided into substrings between the sites , which we call mpo bonds .",
    "next , we assign to each mpo bond a symbolic label which will later indicate , where we may perform merges and forks . the decisive information , that such a symbolic label carries , is a list of ( operator , position)-pairs which either have already been applied to the left , implying forking behavior , or which will be applied to the right , leading to merging behavior .",
    "more specifically , if we assign an mpo bond between sites @xmath76 and @xmath77 with one of the labels @xmath89 we denote , in the first case that , on the current string , operators @xmath90 and @xmath91 were applied on sites @xmath62 and @xmath92 to the left and @xmath93 .",
    "we refer to this type of label as a _",
    "fork_-label , because we defined forking as the process of collapsing substrings to the left .",
    "for this reason the label must serve as an identifier for the left part of the current string . in the second case , operators @xmath90 and @xmath91 will be applied on sites @xmath45 and @xmath94 to the right , @xmath95 , which serves as an identifier for the right substring from site @xmath77 onwards . for both types of labels",
    "we imply the presence of identity operators on sites not mentioned in the label . between each pair of sites , all mpo bonds with identical labels",
    "may now be collapsed into a single bond to obtain a compact representation of the hamiltonian operator .",
    "duplicate common substrings between different terms are avoided in this way , because the row and column labels will be identical within shared sections . in a final stage , at each mpo bond , we enumerate the symbolic labels , in arbitrary order , which yields the @xmath96 and @xmath97 matrix indices of @xmath98 .    , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , with combined common subsequences .",
    "open squares correspond to operators , filled squares to operators multiplied by the matrix element @xmath101 . ]",
    "this leads to the question of when to apply which type of label .",
    "the general idea is to start with fork labels from the left and with merge labels from the right .",
    "considering , for instance , a term @xmath102 , @xmath103 , the four non - trivial operators divide the string running over all sites into the five substrings 1@xmath62 , @xmath62@xmath76 , @xmath76@xmath45 , @xmath45@xmath92 and @xmath92@xmath2 with different symbolic labels . since we start with fork from the left and merge from the right , we need to concern ourselves with the three substrings in the center .",
    "regarding the connectivity types of the labels for these substrings , the combinations _ fork - fork - merge _ or _ fork - merge - merge _ lead to particularly compact mpo representations .",
    "the former combination is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4term ] : all terms in the series @xmath102 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 share the operators at sites @xmath104 and @xmath92 , such that the matrix element @xmath101 has to be multiplied by the operator at site @xmath45 , coinciding with the position at which the label type changes from _ fork _ to _ merge_.    we now focus on one site @xmath105 only and describe the shape of @xmath106 for an mpo containing the terms @xmath107 this simplification will retain the dominant structural features of the mpo for the hamiltonian in eq .  , because there are still @xmath69 terms in this set . assigning all terms the described labels and subsequent numbering on each mpo bond yields @xmath108 .",
    "[ fig : mposcale ] shows the result with labels sorted such that distinct subblocks can be recognized . from their labels we can infer the following properties : +    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     both rows and columns contain labels with at most two positions , implying that the matrix size scales as @xmath109 .",
    "the cost of contracting the operator with the mps on one site is proportional to the number of non - zero elements in the mpo matrix .",

    "although the convergence behaviour may be improved by introducing a tiny ad - hoc noise term @xcite , for chemical applications , the so - called two - site dmrg algorithm , in which two sites are optimized at the same time , achieves faster convergence and is much less likely to get stuck in local minima . in the mps - mpo formalism",

    "from the previous section to two - site dmrg by exchanging @xmath191 with @xmath192 and @xmath193 with @xmath194 and obtain @xmath195 the different steps in evaluating the above expression are essentially the same as for the single - site case , such that the same program routines can be used for both optimization schemes after the generation of the two - site tensors .      the mps - based state specific algorithm to economically calculate excited states @xcite repeatedly orthogonalizes the excited state against a supplied list of orthogonal states at every micro - iteration during the jacobi - davidson diagonalization step .",

    "the efficiency of an mpo dmrg implementation critically depends on the representation of the mpo .",
    "as we have shown , both a compact construction and the exploitation of sparsity are necessary to achieve optimal scaling . to demonstrate its capabilities , we calculated ground- and excited - state energies of the graphene fragments g2 and g3 shown in fig .",

    "the conjugation in both molecules provides for long - range correlation in two dimensions and they are therefore difficult to treat with dmrg , which performs best for one - dimensional and quasi one - dimensional systems . in other systems with less delocalization and mixed active spaces , containing both @xmath205- and @xmath206-type molecular orbitals and possibly exhibiting spatial point group symmetry ,",

    "@xcite , employing the same basis set . in accordance with their work , we found that performing pipek - mezey localization @xcite first within the active occupied orbitals , followed by a second pipek - mezey localization of the active virtual orbitals , provided the molecular orbital basis with the best convergence .",
