    "condensed matter physics has , in recent years , been partly focused on the search for new materials that harbor topological states .",
    "a topological state is a gapped many - body state that can not be adiabatically connected to the atomic limit while preserving a certain symmetry group , and yet can not be associated with any local order parameter . in place of order parameters , topological numbers , a global quantity contributed to by all the electrons in system , distinguish a topological state from a trivial one .",
    "initial efforts have focused on the elucidation of topological states whose existence and global properties are stabilized by the presence of time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) .",
    "this search has led to the examination of a plethora of 2d@xcite and 3d non - interacting band insulating systems@xcite under a wide variety of experimental conditions seeking to explore the fundamental spin and charge behavior of trs topological band insulators . yet",
    "the underlying principles of symmetry preservation required for the stability of a topological phase within a given host material are quite general in nature thereby making the trs class of topological non - interacting band insulators but one in a long list of candidate topological materials .",
    "therefore , while we understand a great deal about the physical nature of trs topological band insulators , we are at but the beginning in the search for topological materials@xcite .    from theoretical point of view , the discussion of topological materials beyond those that preserve trs took a significant step forward when the heusler class of materials were predicted as topological candidates@xcite . while the specific focus of the original work@xcite had been to explore the existence of additional trs topological band insulator candidates in the heusler class of materials , the heusler compounds exhibit an extremely wide range of physical phenomena such as ferromagnetism@xcite , which expressly breaks trs , and heavy fermion behavior@xcite .",
    "this work provided early indications that multiple symmetries can be present in materials and establish different topological orders .",
    "fu@xcite was the first to provide an explicit proof that , in 2d and 3d band insulating systems , the presence of rotational symmetry in the underlying lattice structure , namely @xmath5 , together with time - reversal symmetry give rise to a new @xmath6 classification for such insulators even in the absence of spin - orbit coupling .",
    "such materials which have topological states whose existence is guaranteed by the presence of underlying crystalline symmetry are commonly referred to as topological crystalline insulators ( tci ) . from this early work ,",
    "the search for topological materials beyond those with trs has since been expanded .",
    "predictions of other types that can be generally classified as topological crystalline systems have emerged , including that of inversion symmetric topological materials@xcite , and of rotationally invariant topological band insulators@xcite .",
    "topological crystalline insulators protected by mirror reflection symmetry@xcite and glide reflection symmetries@xcite have been theoretically studied and some have been confirmed in experiments@xcite .",
    "most recently , predictions of topological semimetals whose band crossings are protected by rotational invariance@xcite have also seen experimental confirmation in na@xmath7bi@xcite and in cd@xmath7as@xmath8@xcite .",
    "one can further consider the case where particle number is no longer conserved - that is , the case of superconductors , represented by a bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) hamiltonian . ref .",
    "[ ] studied the topological classifications of fully gapped superconductors in all dimensions both in the presence and absence of time - reversal symmetry and spin - rotation symmetry .",
    "this initial work has been followed by further research into topological phases in superconductors containing various symmetries such as : trs superconductors@xcite , reflection symmetric superconductors@xcite , non - centrosymmetric superconductors@xcite , topological superfluid @xmath9he - b@xcite , and weyl superconductors@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the superconducting phase of materials with general rotational invariance has remained relatively unstudied ( yet see ref .",

    "rotational symmetries are important in understanding the superconducting behavior demonstrated in the heusler alloys labipt@xcite and , most recently , in yptbi@xcite .",
    "hence there is a need for theoretical elucidation of the possible corresponding topological nature of such superconducting systems .    in this work",
    "we study topological superconductors that possess @xmath10 rotational symmetry with and without spin - orbital interactions , and ask if the presence of @xmath10 symmetry can stabilize additional topological crystalline superconductors .",
    "we also explore how the @xmath11 symmetry places constraints on the invariants of the original bdg classes .",
    "we ask this question broadly by considering the behavior of each of the @xmath12 distinct bogoliubov- de gennes ( bdg ) symmetry classes , namely class c , d , ci and diii , of random matrices from the altland and zimbauer ( az)@xcite in @xmath2d , @xmath3d , and @xmath4d .",
    "the answer to such a question has direct relevance to a wide range of unconventional superconducting materials such as cuprates and iron - based superconductors . in section [ sec : prelim ] , we discuss the necessary general background to understand the subsequent analysis . in section [ sec:1d ] , we perform a complete classification of @xmath2d superconductors with rotational symmetries . in the classification , we find it important to distinguish the case where the @xmath11 symmetry is represented projectively from the case where it is linearly represented : in the former case , time - reversal symmetry _",
    "anti - commutes _ with the rotation symmetry when acting on a bogoliubov quasiparticle .",
    "which case appears depends on the total angular momentum of the cooper pair . in section [ sec:2d ]",
    ", we consider chern superconductors in @xmath3d with rotational symmetries , deriving explicit relations between the chern number and the rotation eigenvalues of occupied bands at high - symmetry points . in section [ sec:3d ] , we apply our knowledge of @xmath2d superconductors to classify both high - symmetry and generic lines within the brillouin zone ( bz ) of @xmath4d superconductors by determining not only the bulk invariants but also the effective surface theory . in section",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] , we summarize our results and their implications .",
    "the az classification of single particle hamiltonians@xcite is based on the transformation properties of the single particle hamiltonian under two local symmetries , namely , particle - hole symmetry ( phs , or @xmath13 ) and time - reversal symmetry ( trs , or @xmath14 ) , and their composition which is called chiral symmetry .",
    "a non - interacting hamiltonian here refers to a hamiltonian that only has quadratic couplings among the creation and annihilation operators ( in the second quantized form ) , and can be put into a matrix , @xmath15 , in the orbital basis ( or nambu basis when charge is not conserved ) in the first quantized form .",
    "the two local antiunitary symmetries are , given a basis , represented by @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 are unitary matrices and @xmath19 complex conjugation .",
    "a hamiltonian @xmath15 is said to have @xmath14 if and only if @xmath20=0 $ ] and have @xmath13 if and only if @xmath21 .",
    "we remark that these formulas apply in the first quantized form , where all operators are represented by matrices , while in the second quantized form , where operators are expanded in terms of fermion annihilation and creation operators , both p and t should commute with h , and p becomes a _",
    "unitary _ operator .",
    "hereafter , we use hatted symbols for second quantized operators , and non - hatted ones for their first quantized forms.when both @xmath13 and @xmath14 are present , we can define @xmath22 such that @xmath23 , and we say the system has chiral symmetry @xmath24 . however , there are cases where @xmath24 is a symmetry , i.e. , @xmath23 , while neither @xmath17 nor @xmath16 is a symmetry .",
    "now we consider a local unitary symmetry added to the system , represented by some unitary matrix @xmath25 , which generically satisfies = 0",
    ". therefore the hamiltonian can be block - diagonalized into sectors spanned by eigenvectors of @xmath26 , namely , = h_r_1_r_2 ... +h_r_l , where @xmath27 is the number of eigenvalues of @xmath26 , and @xmath28 the eigenvalues ; in sector @xmath29 , the basis vectors are eigenstates of @xmath25 with eigenvalue @xmath29 . for each sector , we can classify each @xmath30 according to its transformation under time - reversal , particle - hole and chiral symmetries .",
    "physically , time - reversal and particle - hole symmetries commute with all spatial symmetries , and let us assume that @xmath31=[{kp},{l}]=0 $ ] .",
    "however , one is reminded that generally @xmath32\\neq0 $ ] and @xmath33\\neq0 $ ] . this is because if @xmath34 , @xmath17 or @xmath16 sends the state to another sector with eigenvalue @xmath35 .",
    "however the chiral symmetry , represented by a unitary matrix , preserves the block structure of @xmath15 .",
    "based on this discussion , we come to a simple conclusion : for any @xmath36 , the hamiltonian @xmath37 inherits the particle - hole , time - reversal and chiral symmetries the system may have , thus having the same topological classification as that found ref .",
    "[ ] . on the other hand , if @xmath38 , @xmath37 only inherits the chiral symmetry of the system , should the system possess chiral symmetry , while the time - reversal and particle - hole symmetries relate @xmath37 to @xmath39 . due to this relation , the topological invariants for @xmath40 and @xmath39",
    "will be shown to be either the same or opposite , depending on @xmath24 and the symmetry class of the hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , a local unitary symmetry in general enhances the topological classifications , as now the full system is labeled by all the quantum numbers from each sector ( if @xmath36 ) and each pair of sectors ( if @xmath38 ) , rather than the single @xmath1 or @xmath6 number for the entire hamiltonian @xmath15 .    a point group , or specifically rotational , symmetry is in general _ not _ a local symmetry , as it changes the position of an electron .",
    "the only exceptions are mirror reflection in a 2d system when then mirror plane and the system are coplanar , and the rotation in a 1d system when the rotation axis coincides with the system .",
    "nonetheless , for single particle hamiltonians with translational symmetry , there are always some sub - manifolds in the @xmath41-space that are invariant under a point group symmetry . for example",
    ", in a 3d simple cubic lattice , the tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath42 in @xmath41-space is invariant under mirror reflection @xmath43 when @xmath44 or @xmath45 ; and it is invariant under the fourfold rotation about the @xmath46-axis @xmath47 , if @xmath48 or @xmath49 , where the lattice constant is taken to be unity , @xmath50 . for an invariant sub - manifold ,",
    "the point group symmetry becomes a local symmetry , and hence , we can use the general scheme described above , i.e. , classifying the sectors labeled by the eigenvalues of @xmath25 , to find the classification and the corresponding invariants of the hamiltonian on the sub - manifold .",
    "the set of quantum numbers defined on all these invariant sub - manifolds characterize a general topological crystalline insulator or superconductor .",
    "it is this method that we will be using to classify superconductors with rotation symmetry within the context of this work .",
    "we should note , however , that this characterization is incomplete and there exist interesting exceptions@xcite .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "[ ] , the authors show that 3d spinless systems host topological numbers that are protected by rotation symmetry but yet can not be defined on any of the high - symmetry lines .      having clarified the role of rotational symmetries in general hamiltonians , it is important to mark the difference between spinless and spinful systems .",
    "as superconductors are , naturally , electronic systems and their constituent electrons are elementary particles with spin one - half , this distinction does not refer to the spin state of an electron . for our purposes",
    ", the term ` spinless ' simply refers to the unbroken su(2 ) spin rotation symmetry , while the term ` spinful ' indicates its absence .",
    "when the spin - orbit interaction is ignored , an su(2 ) invariant hamiltonian can be block - diagonalized into two parts , namely those of spin up and the spin down parts , while both the trs and phs can be composed with a spin - rotation about a specific directional axis ( say , @xmath51-axis ) so as to not change the spin state , thus acting within each block .",
    "this signifies that the symmetries of the whole system completely pass to each of the respective spin sectors , and it is therefore sufficient to study any one of the two independent ` spinless ' hamiltonians to understand the properties of the system as a whole .",
    "however , this is not quite the complete picture of the proper physics .",
    "one needs to take caution in that since phs and trs are now combined with a spin rotation , their squares change sign , resulting in @xmath52 .",
    "this becomes a vital distinction and is needed when we discuss rotational symmetries .",
    "a full rotation of an electron gives a @xmath53 factor to the wavefunctions due to the inherent @xmath54 berry s phase .",
    "this points to the fact that for a general electronic system , we have @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the rotation operator of an @xmath0-fold rotation .",
    "when su(2 ) is present , the rotation symmetry can be redefined as a rotation of both spin and space followed by a spin rotation in the opposite direction .",
    "in such a case , we have @xmath57 .",
    "physically this means that in the absence of soc , a rotation symmetry only operates on the spatial degrees of freedom , leaving the spin part unchanged . within the context of operators , the terms ` spinless ' and ` spinful ' indicate @xmath58 and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "we are interested in discussing the properties of mean - field superconducting systems , and hence we must understand how the previously discussed rotational symmetries manifest themselves in a bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) hamiltonian .",
    "the second - quantized form of a bdg hamiltonian reads : = _ 0++^ , where _ 0&=&h_abc^_ac_b+h.c . , + & = & _ abc_ac_b , where @xmath59 are composed indices labeling the site , orbital and spin in a lattice system . in an @xmath0-fold rotation invariant system",
    ", we require that [ eq : rotcomnorm ] [ _ n,_0]=0 , and [ eq : delta ] _ n_n^-1=e^i . using the fact that @xmath60 for spinless and spinful systems respectively in conjunction with eq.([eq : delta ] ) , we find @xmath61 , or @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",
    "consider a gauge transform @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the total electric charge operator , such that _",
    "mc_a^-1_m = e^-im / nc_a , and if we combine @xmath66 with @xmath67 , from eq .",
    "[ eq : rotcomnorm ] , we have = 0 .",
    "therefore , we may define @xmath68 as a symmetry of the system . in a translation invariant system",
    ", we have [ eq : cnginvariance ] c_n , mh(k)c_n , m^-1=h(c_nk ) , where @xmath69 is the first quantized matrix representation of @xmath70 in the nambu basis .",
    "the significance of eq.([eq : cnginvariance ] ) lies in that the spectrum of @xmath71 remains rotationally invariant even when @xmath72 .",
    "physically , @xmath72 indicates that the cooper pair has total angular momentum @xmath73 along the rotation axis ( modulo @xmath0 ) , because the pair gains a phase of @xmath74 after a rotation through @xmath75 .",
    "nevertheless , this change of phase is not reflected in the quasiparticle spectrum , which is still @xmath0-fold symmetric , due to eq.([eq : cnginvariance ] ) .",
    "this is because the phase can be compensated by a u(1 ) transform which leaves @xmath76 invariant .",
    "additionally , we should also point out that [ eq : cnmandcn ] c_n , m^n=(-1)^m_n^n=(-1)^m+f , where @xmath77 for spinless and spinful fermions , respectively .",
    "therefore , when @xmath78 , @xmath79 is like a spinless ( spinful ) rotation in a spinful ( spinless ) system .",
    "mathematically , when @xmath78 , eq.([eq : cnmandcn ] ) indicates that @xmath69 and @xmath17 form a projective representation of the group generated by @xmath11 and @xmath13 , a fact that we rigorously prove in appendix [ app : pc ] .      in this paper",
    "we also consider superconductors with trs .",
    "naturally , trs implies that ^-1=. using eq.([eq : delta ] ) , we have [ eq : cntdelta1 ] _",

    "eq.([eq : cnmandt ] ) indicates that the @xmath88 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 form a projective representation of the group generated by @xmath14 , @xmath11 and @xmath13 .",
    "we again defer the proof to appendix [ app : pct ] .",
    "we now proceed to @xmath2d , and some quasi-@xmath2d systems , where the rotation along an axis parallel to the system is a symmetry represented by a matrix @xmath69 satisfying the commutation relation , = 0 .",
    "it should be noted that in one dimension , there is no crystallographic constraint on @xmath0 , and therefore @xmath89 ( positive integers ) . as we classify the respective gapped superconductors with rotational symmetries in @xmath2d below , we separate the discussions into two distinct sections : one in which the total angular momentum of the cooper pair is zero ( @xmath83 ) and one where the angular momentum is non - zero ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "most generic of bdg hamiltonians , which belong to class d in the az classification table , have preserved particle - hole symmetry , which is represented by @xmath17 in the nambu basis , where @xmath19 is the complex conjugate and @xmath13 is a unitary matrix .",
    "physically , we have @xmath90 for an electron , which leads to [ eq : phs ] ( kp)^2=pp^=1 , + p = p^t .",
    "since phs changes electrons to holes and vice versa , it anti - commutes with the first quantized hamiltonian and the momentum operator .",
    "this means that it sends one single particle state to another with opposite energy and momentum ; symbolically we have ( kp)h(k)(kp)^-1=-h(-k ) , or ph(k)p^=-h^t(-k ) .",

    "in addition to phs , which is shared by all superconductors , we consider the presence of trs , corresponding to class diii in the az classification . in the nambu basis",

    "( iv ) finally , for @xmath143 , @xmath94 may take the value of @xmath141 but not @xmath53 , and @xmath144 gives a @xmath6 number @xmath145 .",
    "the @xmath6-index for the full hamiltonian , neglecting rotation symmetry , is the same as the sum of the @xmath6-indices corresponding to each sector with a real eigenvalue of @xmath69 .",
    "now we consider adding trs to the system .",
    "in sec.[sec : project ] we have shown that the only nonzero @xmath81 that is compatible with trs is @xmath84 when @xmath85 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath146 and @xmath16 anti - commute , i.e. , [ eq : cnandt2 ] tc_n , n/2t^=-c^_n , n/2 .",
    "eq.([eq : cnandt2 ] ) indicates that trs maps a state with @xmath69 eigenvalue @xmath94 to a state with eigenvalue @xmath147 .",
    "we note that in this case time - reversal operator anti - commutes with @xmath69 from eq.([eq : cnm ] ) due to the fact that : ( i ) trs commutes with @xmath11 yet anti - commutes with imaginary unit @xmath135 and ( ii ) it commutes with @xmath133 for it does not interchange particles and holes .",
    "therefore , for the case when @xmath84 and we have @xmath85 , we separately discuss the following two constraints on the rotational symmetry : ( i ) @xmath148 and ( ii ) @xmath149 .",
    "when @xmath150 ( @xmath151 being a non - negative integer ) and the general eigenvalue of @xmath69 is @xmath152 ( @xmath27 being a non - negative integer ) , then under phs the @xmath153-sector and the @xmath154-sector are mapped to each other while , at the same time , under trs , the @xmath153-sector and the @xmath155-sector are mapped to each other .",
    "therefore , @xmath156 ( note that @xmath157 in this case ) belongs to class aiii , thereby having a @xmath1-index .",
    "( since @xmath158 maps @xmath159 , the direct sum is invariant under the composite symmetry . )",
    "however , this @xmath1-number must vanish and this can be shown by contradiction .",
    "suppose this @xmath1 number is @xmath160 , then on the edge there are @xmath46 states that are eigenvectors of @xmath158 having eigenvalue @xmath122 , such that @xmath158 in the hilbert space spanned by the zero modes is @xmath161 , where @xmath162 is the identity matrix the dimension of which is the number of zero modes .",
    "then we assume that the rotation symmetry @xmath69 be represented by some matrix @xmath163 , and we have @xmath164=0 $ ] contradicting eq.([eq : pandcnm],[eq : cnandt2 ] ) .",
    "considering the second case , @xmath165 , we know that the general eigenvalue of @xmath146 is @xmath166 . under phs , the @xmath153-sector and the @xmath167 sectors are mapped to each other with the exceptions of @xmath168 and @xmath169 , where @xmath106 and @xmath170 , respectively . as in the previous case , under trs , the @xmath153-sector and the @xmath171-sector are mapped to each other . therefore , for @xmath172 , the hamiltonian @xmath156 belongs to class aiii , while @xmath173 belongs to class diii . based on above argument ,",
    "the @xmath1-index of the class aiii component must vanish , leaving to an overall classification to be @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath6-index for the full hamiltonian , again without considering rotation symmetry , is the same as the @xmath6-index for @xmath173 .    finally , we consider adding su(2 ) symmetry . with phs and su(2 )",
    "the full hamiltonian is in class c , having @xmath174 as the only symmetry . in this case , all sectors of the hamiltonian belong either to class c or to class a , both being trivial .",
    "when we include trs along with phs and su(2 ) , we again need to separately consider the two cases above with regards to the rotational symmetry of the given system .",
    "we first consider the case for @xmath150 in which a generic eigenvalue of @xmath146 is @xmath166 .",
    "under phs , the @xmath153-sector and the @xmath167 sectors are mapped to each other with the exceptions of @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "further , under the application of trs , the @xmath153-sector and the @xmath171-sector are mapped to each other , with the exceptions of @xmath175 and @xmath176 , where @xmath177-sector is mapped to itself .",
    "therefore , for @xmath178 , the hamiltonian @xmath179 belongs to class aiii and is characterized by a vanishing @xmath1-index .",
    "similarly , the sectors corresponding to @xmath180 and @xmath181 belong to class ci , and possess only a trivial classification resulting in an overall classification for the system that is trivial .",
    "for the case corresponding to rotational symmetries satisfying @xmath165 , we have eigenvalue of @xmath152 . as before , under phs , the @xmath153-sector and the @xmath154-sector are mapped to each other , and the application of trs maps the @xmath153-sector and the @xmath155-sector to one another , with the exception of @xmath182 . therefore , for @xmath183 , the hamiltonian @xmath156 belongs to class aiii , having a @xmath1-classification but with vanishing @xmath1-index , while @xmath181 belongs to class ci , having trivial classification .",
    "accordingly , the overall classification is again trivial .    in table",
    "[ tab:1d ] , we summarize the classification of all gapped 1d superconductors within four bdg classes ( c , d , ci and diii ) of the az classification enhanced by @xmath69-symmetry .    .complete classification of 1d gapped superconductors with rotation symmetry , @xmath69 . within the table ,",
    "` 0 ' indicates that for the given system the classification is trivial.[tab:1d ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in conclusion , we have examined the topological properties of the bogoliubov - de gennes hamiltonians from the altland - zimbauer classification scheme corresponding to gapped topological superconductors in one , two and three spatial dimensions in the presence of rotational symmetry . in @xmath2d , we complete the classification by block - diagonalizing the hamiltonian into sectors labeled by rotation eigenvalues , and finding the topological index , @xmath1 or @xmath6 or trivial , for each sector . the role played by the angular momentum of the cooper pairs",
    "is emphasized : it generally leads to a nontrivial projective representation of rotation symmetry , where anomalous commutation relations include @xmath184 and the anti - commutation between the time - reversal and the rotation . in @xmath3d",
    ", we explicitly proved the relation between the chern number and the rotation eigenvalues at high - symmetry points , and showed that in the weak - coupling limit , the contribution breaks down to two parts .",
    "one part is from the normal state band structure the other part is from the angular momentum of the cooper pairs . in @xmath4d",
    ", we found the bulk topological invariants for all rotational symmetries , linearly and projectively represented , defined on high - symmetry lines and generic lines ; we correspondingly found the relevant surface theories for both generic and high - symmetry points in the surface brillouin zone .",

    "a linear representation of the group generated by @xmath13 and @xmath11 must satisfy [ eq : linearrp ] d(p)d^(p)&=&1 , + d^n(c_n)&=&(-1)^f , + d(c_n)d(p)&=&d(p)d^(c_n ) . all representations that do not obey these relations , but obey them up to some phase factor , are called projective representations .",
    "however , there is a class of projective representations that are trivial , as they can be transformed back into a linear representation by multiplying each element some phase factor .",
    "if a projective representation can not be brought back to a linear representation , it is called a nontrivial projective representation .",
    "we prove by contradiction that if a projective representation satisfies d(c_n)d(p)=d(p)d^(c_n ) , + d^n(c_n)=-(-1)^f , then it must be nontrivial .",
    "suppose it is trivial , then we can redefine the generators as [ eq : projrp ] d(p)(p)e^i(p ) , + d(c_n)(c_n)e^i(c_n ) , so that eq.([eq : linearrp ] ) becomes d(p)d^(p)&=&1 , + d^n(c_n)&=&e^in(c_n)(-1)^f , + d(c_n)d(p)e^i(c_n)&=&d(p)d^(c_n)e^-i(c_n ) . in order to satisfy eq.([eq : projrp ] ) , one requires ( c_n)=m / n , ( c_n)=0 , , where @xmath78 .",
    "it is obvious that the two equations are contradictory .",
    "therefore , a representation satisfying eq.([eq : projrp ] ) is a nontrivial projective representation .",
    "a linear representation of the group should satisfy , besides the equations in eq.([eq : linearrp ] ) d(p)d^(t)&=&d(t)d^(p ) , + d(t)d^(c_n)&=&d(c_n)d(t ) , + d(t)d^(t)&=&(-1)^f . we prove that when @xmath85 , representations that satisfy [ eq : projrp2 ] d(t)d^(d_n)&=&-d(c_n)d(t ) , + d(p)d^(c_n)&=&d(c_n)d(p ) . must be nontrivial .",
    "again we first assume that it is trivial , so that one can find @xmath185 and @xmath186 such that eq.([eq : projrp2 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "multiply @xmath187 and @xmath188 with phase factors @xmath189 and @xmath190 so that they satisfy d(t)d^(c_n)e^-i(c_n)&=&d(c_n)d(t)e^i(c_n ) , + d(p)d^(c_n)e^-i(c_n)&=&d(c_n)d(p)e^i(c_n ) . in order to satisfy eq.([eq : projrp2 ] ) , one requires , respectively ( c_n)&= & , + ( c_n)&=&0 , which obviously contradict each other .",
    "therefore , a representation satisfying eq.([eq : projrp2 ] ) is indeed a nontrivial projective representation .",
    "here we assume that the wavefunction , or more precisely , the projector onto the occupied space at @xmath192 is well defined , which is denoted by @xmath193 .",
    "this ensures a closed manifold , which is necessary for a well regularized chern number calculation .    consider a loop that consists of three parts : ( i ) a straight line from @xmath194 to a very large @xmath195 , the azimuthal angle of which is zero , ( ii ) an arc going counterclockwise by @xmath196 from @xmath195 to @xmath197and ( iii ) a straight line going from @xmath197 back to @xmath194 ( see fig.[fig : appn ] ) .      calling them segments 1 , 2 , 3 and dividing each segment into @xmath199 smaller segments ,",

    "the last equality uses the fact that for very small @xmath196 , the integral must also be very small , so the integer part is zero .",
