    "it is generally accepted that a final distinct stage in the formation of our planetary system consisted of the clearing of a residual planetesimal population by the gravitational perturbations of fully  formed giant planets .",
    "the formation of the oort cloud , which is a spherical swarm of comets orbiting the sun at distances of @xmath9 au , is thought to be a product of this stage of solar system formation .",
    "mass estimates for the oort cloud are in the range @xmath0 to @xmath10 ( @xcite ) .",
    "another remnant of the planetesimal disk is the recently discovered population of the kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) that orbit beyond neptune .",
    "although the mass of the observable portion of the kuiper belt is only @xmath11 m@xmath1 ( @xcite ) , planetesimal accretion models require an initial mass that is of order @xmath12 m@xmath1 for the assembly of pluto and the @xmath13 km ",
    "sized kbos in the 3050 au zone ( @xcite , @xcite ) . noting also that the solid cores of the giant planets are of order @xmath0 m@xmath1 , and that core formation is not likely to have been @xmath14 efficient , it is quite plausible that there was still a residual planetesimal disk of mass @xmath0100 m@xmath1 in the vicinity of the giant planets after they formed .",
    "the eventual removal of this mass via gravitational scattering by the giant planets could have caused significant evolution of the planetary orbits , such that the presently observed orbital configuration of the jovian planets is considerably altered from that which was obtained soon after their formation .    not only is an early epoch of planet migration plausible based upon formation considerations , but recent advances in our knowledge of the outer solar system provide new motivation for studying this process .",
    "the determination of reasonably reliable orbits for several dozen kbos has revealed that their distribution is quite non  uniform : there is a near  complete dearth of kbos having semimajor axes @xmath15",
    "interior to neptune s 3:2 mean  motion resonance at 39.4 au , and there is a prominent concentration of objects at the 3:2 resonance with moderately large eccentricities @xmath160.35 ( @xcite ) .",
    "several other kbos orbit at the 4:3 , 5:3 , and at the 2:1 resonances , all with moderately large eccentricities .",
    "there is also a non  resonant kbo population beyond the 3:2 resonance which extends out to 47 au ; these objects exist in more circular orbits with @xmath17 .",
    "this peculiar orbital distribution supports the hypothesis that neptune s orbit migrated radially outwards , sweeping the primordial kuiper belt with that planet s mean  motion resonances , and capturing pluto as well as a cohort of kbos at those resonances ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "both the semimajor axes and the eccentricities of captured bodies would have grown concurrently with the planet s orbital expansion .",
    "the inclinations of kbos can also become excited when a vertical secular resonance sweeps past ( @xcite ) .",
    "analysis of the resonance  sweeping mechanism shows that if planet migration were responsible for the eccentric and inclined orbits of pluto and the other kbos at the 3:2 resonance , then neptune s orbit must have expanded by @xmath18 au on a timescale of order @xmath19 years or longer ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite estimated that the gravitational clearing of a residual planetesimal disk having a mass of about 35 m@xmath1 distributed in the vicinity of uranus and neptune would expand neptune s orbit by @xmath20 au .",
    "the planet ",
    "migration / resonance  sweeping hypothesis not only accounts for the abundance of eccentric , inclined kbos locked in orbital resonance with neptune , but it also accounts for the lack of low  eccentricity orbits in the 3:2 , the depleted region interior to the 3:2 as well as the excited @xmath16 state of the non  resonant kbos .",
    "it is thus possible that the characteristics of the orbital migration history of neptune ( and , by extension , the other giant planets ) is preserved in the details of the kbo orbital distribution .",
    "orbital migration was first noted in the giant planet accretion models of @xcite which showed that the orbits of a growing proto uranus and neptune could shift by @xmath2110 au while embedded in a planetesimal disk having a mass of order @xmath22 m@xmath1 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite argue that uranus and neptune would preferentially gain angular momentum ( and thus expand their orbits ) by scattering planetesimals and lowering their perihelia down to jupiter and saturn .",
    "jupiter , being an effective planetesimal ejector , would shrink its orbit due to the resulting energy and angular momentum losses .",
    "however it should be noted that this argument , while plausible , is not fully supported by their numerical simulations .",
    "those simulations show net orbital expansion by uranus and neptune in some instances and orbital decay in others .",
    "individual runs show considerable to  and  fro motion by neptune .",
    "such evolution would only stir up the planetesimals rather than trap them at resonances .",
    "we note that these simulations were not fully self ",
    "consistent since gravitational interactions were considered only between planets and planetesimals that were on crossing orbits ; long range forces between the planets and the planetesimals were neglected , as were the mutual planet - planet perturbations .",
    "also , the giant planets gravitational cross  sections were artificially increased in order to speed up the system s evolution .",
    "this approximate treatment of planet - planetesimal dynamics was necessitated partly due to the limited computer resources available at the time . a more realistic treatment of disk clearing and planet  migration is clearly warranted .",
    "the present work revisits the planet ",
    "migration scenario using more sophisticated numerical techniques to evolve a system of giant planets that is embedded in a disk composed of many low  mass particles . in section [ method ] , we describe the model and test results in detail .",
    "primary results on the giant planets orbital evolution with disks having different initial masses are given in section [ migration ] .",
    "since the planetesimal disk is the source of oort cloud , we discuss the implications of our results for the formation of the oort cloud in section [ oort_cloud ] . particles that manage to avoid ejection will reside in what are sometimes called the classical and the scattered disks , which are characterized in section [ scat_disk ] .",
    "the role of unmodeled effects such as disk self  gravity and the role of spiral density waves are discussed in section [ waves ] , and conclusions are given in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "our model consists of the sun , the four giant planets jupiter , saturn , uranus , neptune , and a population of numerous @xmath23 low  mass particles initially distributed in a disk .",
    "ideally , one would like to have @xmath24 to follow the evolution of this system with a completely self - consistent calculation of the mutual gravitational perturbations and also include the external forcing due to the galactic tide .",
    "however such a calculation exceeds current computational resources . instead ,",
    "as we describe below , we use a fast orbit integrator together with several simplifications to obtain an approximation to the ideal within a reasonable amount of computing time .    in our simulations ,",
    "all bodies are treated as point masses , thus the possibility of collisions or accretion is neglected .",
    "this approximation is justified during the late stages of giant planet formation when the frequency of planet - particle collisions is smaller than the scattering frequency by a factor of the planet s physical radius / hill radius squared , which ranges from @xmath25 for jupiter to @xmath26 for neptune .",
    "the model includes the mutual gravitational forces exerted between the planets as well as the forces between the planets and the low  mass particles , but the forces amongst the particles themselves are neglected .",
    "this approximation is employed to reduce the computational expense , and it also eliminates the unphysical self  stirring that would otherwise occur in the model disks considered below that have masses of @xmath2 to 200 m@xmath1 distributed among just @xmath27 particles .",
    "had the particle - particle interactions been included , the relatively small number of @xmath28 massive disk particles would quickly stir themselves up so much that the resulting system would hardly resemble a planet  forming particle disk .",
    "although this difficulty is avoided by neglecting the particle  particle forces , this approximation also precludes the possibility that the planets might generate spiral density waves in the disk ( see section [ waves ] ) .",
    "dynamical models have shown that particles scattered into wide orbits with semimajor axes @xmath29 au become decoupled from the planets due to the galactic tide ( @xcite ; see also section [ oort_cloud ] ) .",
    "these distant bodies are deposited in the oort cloud , which is effected here by simply removing particles from the system when @xmath30 au .",
    "a second - order mixed variable symplectic ( mvs ) mapping is used to rapidly advance the heliocentric positions and velocities of the planets and low  mass particles as they interact in the sun s gravitational field .",
    "our implementation follows the algorithm of @xcite with the improvements of @xcite .",
    "a fixed step size of @xmath31 years is used , which is sufficiently short to resolve the orbits of particles that evolve down to perihelia of @xmath32 au as well as most encounters between particles and planets . for the latter ,",
    "the dynamical timescale of a typical scattering event is to @xmath33 for a planet  centered parabolic orbit having a pericenter distance @xmath34 from the planet . ]",
    "@xmath35 where @xmath36 is the scattering planet s mass and @xmath34 is the particle s closest approach distance .",
    "evaluating @xmath37 with @xmath34 set to each planet s hill sphere radius shows that @xmath38 years at jupiter , 10 years at saturn , 29 years at uranus , and 57 years at neptune .",
    "thus the integration timestep of @xmath31 years is at worst 1/10 of the dynamical time for orbits that graze jupiter s hill sphere .",
    "however an mvs algorithm that employs a fixed step size will fail to resolve very close planet ",
    "particle encounters that penetrate well within a planet s hill sphere , and will also fail to correctly evolve a very eccentric orbit when the perihelion passage is not well time  sampled ( @xcite ) .",
    "these difficulties are mitigated by the using the following approximations .",
    "( _ i. _ ) during a close encounter between a particle and a planet , two ",
    "body trajectories are adopted for their relative motion whenever a particle passes sufficiently close to a planet .",
    "experimentation shows that a `` sufficiently close '' encounter is one that changes the particle s fractional distance from the planet by more than 50% , or varies its planet  centered angular coordinate by more than 90@xmath39 , during the time step @xmath40 . for particles that are initially in low  eccentricity heliocentric orbits , the two  body approximation is triggered only when a particle approaches within about @xmath41 of the planet s hill sphere . for more distant encounters , particle trajectories",
    "are in fact evolved with greater accuracy using the standard mvs mapping .",
    "_ ) when a particle evolves into an orbit of sufficiently high eccentricity , its motion during perihelion passage may be poorly time - sampled and the mvs mapping can produce unphysical evolution . for the step size employed here , significant errors accrue in orbits having perihelia @xmath42 au .",
    "proper treatment of such orbits is not of minor import since approximately 30% of the disk particles cycle through the inner solar system with heliocentric distances of @xmath43 au .",
    "a simple , but impractical solution , is to use a step size small enough to resolve all perihelion passages .",
    "however a more practical approach consists of turning off all planetary perturbations while a particle travels interior to a heliocentric distance of @xmath43 au ; this results in a piecewise keplerian trajectory that is approximately correct . with this approximation ,",
    "the particle s perturbations upon the planets are still not fully time  sampled , which causes slow drifts in the system s total energy and angular momentum .",
    "numerical experimentation has shown that the most economical and robust solution to this problem requires turning off the particle s perturbations upon the planets while its _ perihelion _ distance is @xmath44 au .",
    "the remainder of this section describes a few critical tests of the algorithm in order to demonstrate that the approximations made here do not introduce any artificial orbital evolution of the planets and the particles that is of any significance .",
    "the quality of the orbit integrations may be illustrated with the restricted three  body problem that consists of a massless particle perturbed by a planet on a circular orbit about the sun .",
    "for this system the particle s jacobi integral @xmath45 is conserved , where @xmath46 is the particle s energy , @xmath47 is its component of angular momentum perpendicular to the planet s orbit , and @xmath48 is the planet s mean motion .",
    "figure [ delta j ] shows the mean fractional variations @xmath49 that result when integrating 100 particles for @xmath50 years with a jupiter - mass planet at @xmath51 au . squares are shown for those particles that start in rather circular orbits near and beyond the planet ; these experience a @xmath52 that decreases with distance provided they have not already made a close approach to jupiter .",
    "filled squares indicate particles that approach closer than a hill distance to jupiter ; these experience larger variations in @xmath53 due to the close ",

    "the remaining particles ( crosses and circles ) are all on jupiter  crossing orbits with their perihelia ranging over @xmath54 au .",
    "crosses are shown for particles that do not encounter jupiter , whereas filled circles represent particles that do encounter the planet .",
    "the crosses show that @xmath49 grows inwards of jupiter s orbit due to the poor time  sampling of the particles perihelion passages",
    ". however the error @xmath49 levels off where the integrator turns off the planet s perturbation and the particle motions are temporarily keplerian . failure to implement this procedure would have instead yielded disastrous results inwards of about @xmath55 au . shrinking the step size @xmath40",
    "would of course reduce the error in @xmath53 but at the expense of precious computer cycles .    an alternate scheme that avoids the growth of numerical errors among low@xmath34 particles is to simply remove them when they drop down to a heliocentric distance of @xmath43 au .",
    "although this procedure inhibits error growth , it is less than desirable since it introduces an unphysical ( and very hungry ) mass sink to the system . when employing this procedure to the simulations of planet ",
    "migration described in section [ migration ] ( which employ the keplerian approximation whenever @xmath43 au ) , we find that the orbital migration of saturn , uranus , and neptune proceeds radially outwards at similar rates",
    ". however the removal of @xmath43 au particles results in an artificial sunward mass  flux that causes jupiter s orbit to expand rather than shrink .",
    "nonetheless , the fact that the orbital evolution of the outer giant  planets is rather insensitive to the treatment of low@xmath34 particles adds confidence that the keplerian approximation employed here is not driving the planet ",
    "migration reported in section [ migration ] .",
    "however enforcing the particles keplerian motion inside of @xmath43 au is still needed in order to accurately model jupiter s orbital history .    in the absence of any close encounters between particles and planets",

    "although this orbit is dynamically forbidden to the test particles , numerical diffusion might allow particles to cross uranus orbit which would result in an unphysical exchange of particles between neptune and uranus .",
    "the system is integrated for @xmath69 years , and at the end of the run 11 particles have diffused into forbidden uranus - crossing orbits that have @xmath70 .",

    "the characteristic diffusion timescale for particles to diffuse across the jacobi ` gap ' , _ i.e. _ , the time when @xmath73 , is @xmath74 years .",
    "however it should be noted that a particle s @xmath53 is not conserved in a multi  planet system .",
    "for example , adding a jupiter at 5 au to the above simulation will drive these particles into uranus - crossing orbits having @xmath70 at a rate that is about 10 times faster . since the numerical diffusion rate is considerably slower than the dynamical diffusion that occurs in a multi  planet system ,",
    "we conclude that the transport of particles between the planets due to numerical diffusion is not significant in these simulations .",
    "as already noted , it is the close encounters between the planets and the planetesimals , and their concomitant exchange of angular momentum , which drive the planet migration process . in our simulations , the planet - particle relative motion during very close encounters is not computed exactly , so any small error in the angular momentum exchange is also reflected in the recoiling planet s orbit . the final test discussed below verifies that the errors in this angular momentum exchange are in fact too small to drive the planet ",
    "migration described in section [ migration ] .",
    "the motion of neptune as well as several hundred particles of infinitesimal mass @xmath75 are integrated at the usual step size @xmath31 years for 200 years .",
    "the same experiment is then repeated using a step size 50 times smaller .",
    "since integration errors decrease with step size , this latter run may be regarded as a much more exact representation of the particle trajectories . upon differencing the two runs ,",
    "the error in each particle s velocity relative to the planet , @xmath76 , is calculated as the particle exits the planet s hill sphere ( see fig .",
    "the figure shows that most encounters occur at the periphery of the planet s hill sphere which result in rather small relative velocity errors .",
    "however the very close encounters having periapse @xmath77 , which account for @xmath78 of these encounters , result in sizable velocity errors that are of order @xmath79 .",
    "the error in the specific angular momentum @xmath80 exchanged between the planet and a scattered particle is @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the planet s heliocentric coordinate and @xmath36 is its mass .",
    "figure [ dv]b shows a histogram of the @xmath83component of the errors @xmath84 which are distributed about zero .",

    "mean  square error is @xmath86 . for the encounters shown in fig .",
    "[ dv ] , the fractional error in the angular momentum exchanged is only @xmath87 .",
    "the above procedure is also repeated for encounters at jupiter , which are less well time  resolved , and yields a larger fractional error @xmath88 .",
    "it should be noted that these fractional errors decrease for higher relative velocities , which reflects the fact that the two  body approximation , which neglects the sun s gravity , becomes more accurate at faster encounters .",
    "thus the error in the total angular momentum exchanged between the planet and neighboring particles will steadily decrease as the planet heats up the particle disk .",
    "since these fractional errors are small , we conclude that the close encounter approximation used here does not drive the planet migration described below .",
    "in the simulations reported here , we adopted initial planet orbits similar to those used in previous investigations of planet migration , in which the semimajor axes of jupiter , saturn , uranus , and neptune are displaced from their present orbits by respective amounts @xmath89 , -0.8 , -3.0 , and -7.0 au ( @xcite ) .",
    "the planets are assumed to have their present masses .",
    "the initial planetesimal disk is composed of 1000 equal  mass particles distributed in orbits of @xmath90 au such that the disk s inner edge lies just exterior to saturn and the outer edge lies just beyond the present location of neptune s 2:1 resonance .",
    "the disk surface density @xmath91 varies as @xmath92 , @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the total disk mass .",
    "thus , approximately two  thirds of the disk starts exterior to neptune s initial orbit .",
    "four separate simulations are presented below in which the disk s initial mass is @xmath2 , 50 , 100 , and 200 m@xmath1 , and the individual disk particles have masses @xmath95 , 0.05 , 0.1 and 0.2 m@xmath1 .",
    "an additional 50 massless particles are also distributed between @xmath96 au in order to assess the degree of perturbation of a hypothetical part of the kuiper belt extending well past that which is presently observable .",
    "it should be noted that accretion models advocate an initial disk containing several tens of earth  masses in the 3050 au zone in order to form pluto and qb@xmath97type kuiper belt objects ( @xcite , @xcite ) , a scenario that is bracketed by the models explored here .    for those particles that initially lie far from any planets , initial eccentricities of @xmath98 and inclinations",
    "@xmath99 are adopted .",
    "however particles having a semimajor axis near a planet will already have experienced a history of stirring that results in particle dispersion velocities @xmath100 of the order of the planet s escape velocity at its hill sphere radius @xmath101 ( @xcite ) , where @xmath102 @xmath103 is the gravitation constant , @xmath104 the planet s mass , and @xmath105 the solar mass . assuming the particles inclinations are half their eccentricities , the particles dispersion velocity is @xmath106 which corresponds to an eccentricity of @xmath107 .",

    "since jupiter and saturn start interior to the particle disk , initially circular and coplanar orbits are adopted for these two planets .",
    "figure [ a(t ) ] shows the orbital histories of the four giant planets as they scatter the surrounding disk particles in each of the four simulations .",
    "we find that the lowest  mass disk , @xmath116 , yields little evolution in the planets orbits , but the higher  mass disks result in significant radial displacements of the planets during the 30 myr runs .",
    "these simulations confirm the expectation that saturn , uranus and neptune migrate radially outwards while jupiter migrates slightly inwards . for a given disk mass ,",
    "the magnitude of radial migration is largest for neptune and successively less so for the interior planets . as might be expected , planetesimal disks of greater mass result in planet migration that is larger in magnitude and more rapid , and also more stochastic owing to the individual particles greater mass .",
    "although the planets orbital eccentricities and inclinations remain small , there is a clear trend towards larger @xmath59 s and @xmath60 s at larger disk masses .",
    "since their final @xmath59 s and @xmath60 s are largely determined by the numbers and masses of disk particles used in the simulations , their final state have little relation to the giant planets current @xmath59 and @xmath60 configurations .",
    "it is worth noting that , in the high  mass disk simulations , the planets pass through a few mutual low ",
    "order mean  motion resonances , but the planets orbits do not persist in any resonance - locked configurations .",
    "this is not entirely surprising as the general trend in the orbital evolution is such that the planets are driven towards greater mutual orbital separation , which is not conducive to maintaining a resonance libration ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ ea ] shows the state of the @xmath117 m@xmath1 system at logarithmic time intervals .",
    "large dots indicate the planets eccentricities and semimajor axes while small dots / crosses denote particles that have / have not had a close approach to a planet .",
    "those particles scattered by the planets yet still bound to the sun tend to have perihelia between the orbits of saturn and neptune , as indicated by the two curves .",
    "it should be noted that in all of the simulations reported here , the orbital migration of the planets has not ceased by the end of the runs , and that further planet ",

    "[ a(t)_50 ] , which shows neptune slowly expanding its orbit out to 30 au .",
    "these results suggest that in order to actually ` park ' neptune at @xmath118 au requires an adjustment of parameters towards a slightly lower disk mass , and/or a steeper gradient in the disk s surface density profile , and/or an outer disk edge that lies closer than 50 au .",
    "the disk particles used in all of these simulations are sufficiently massive that their perturbations upon neptune result in non ",
    "adiabatic expansion of that planet s orbit .",
    "however it is evident in fig.[a(t ) ] that planet migration is smoother when the disk particles have lower mass .",
    "thus a more realistic simulation employing larger numbers of particles will better resolve the disk ",
    "planet perturbations .",
    "we expect that such simulations will exhibit orbit migration which proceeds more smoothly .",
    "nearly adiabatic orbital migration is in fact required if neptune is to efficiently capture particles at its exterior mean  motion resonances .",
    "since smooth outward expansion was not realized in these simulations , neptune did not capture any particles at its mean  motion resonances .",
    "thus the simulated disk s end state can not be directly compared to the delicate resonant structure that is observed in the kuiper belt .",
    "nevertheless , these simulations do provide useful constraints on the likely mass of the initial debris disk that may have been present during an early epoch of planet migration .",
    "figure [ da ] reports the radial displacement @xmath119 experienced by each planet after @xmath120 years as a function of the initial disk mass @xmath94 .",

[ da ] , should be regarded as upper limits since resonance trapping did not occur in these simulations . had resonance capture been realized here , an opposing torque on the planet would have developed since the planet must transfer angular momentum to expand the orbits of particles trapped at resonances .",
    "the back  torque due to a ring of mass @xmath75 that is captured at an exterior @xmath124 mean  motion resonance can be calculated from the rate of change of its angular momentum , @xmath125 .",
    "since the resonant torque from the planet expands the ring s semimajor axis at the rate @xmath126 and also pumps up eccentricities at the rate @xmath127 ( @xcite ) , the rate of change of @xmath128 is @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the ratio of the semimajor axes of the planet and the resonance site , @xmath131 is the planet s mass , and @xmath132 is the net torque on the planet , which simplifies to @xmath133 .",

    "however this mass estimate should be regarded as uncertain by at least an order of magnitude since it relies upon a host of uncertain quantities such as the efficiency of comet detections , the comet brightness ",

    "the dynamics of the oort cloud is succinctly summarized by @xcite .",
    "unless a particle is otherwise ejected from the system , planetary perturbations cause its semimajor axis to diffuse both inwards and outwards while keeping its perihelion locked in the giant planet region of the solar system .",
    "however a more distant particle is susceptible to perturbations by the galactic tide and passing stars which cause its perihelion to diffuse on a timescale that varies as @xmath151 .",
    "those particles reaching @xmath152 au which have had their perihelia raised well beyond the orbit of neptune are thus decoupled from the planets and are usually identified as _ inner _ oort cloud comets .",
    "however the perihelia of more distant bodies diffuse more rapidly , and those with @xmath153 au that reside in the _",
    "oort cloud are in fact more likely to diffuse back into the inner solar system and become observable as new long  period comets .",
    "it is this flux of new comets that provides an important constraint on the amount of mass driven from the initial disk that has managed to avoid ejection during the last 4.5 gyr .",
    "estimates of the oort cloud mass may be inferred from the data given in table [ oort_mass ] .",
    "the quantity @xmath154 is the fraction of the _ dynamically active _ disk that diffuses into the oort cloud at @xmath155 au during each simulation .",
    "the dynamically active disk is that part of the disk where particles are likely to be perturbed into neptune  crossing orbits over the age of the solar system .",
    "long  term integrations of kuiper belt orbits show that particles in the active disk have semimajor axes @xmath156 , where @xmath157 is neptune s semimajor axis ( @xcite ) .",
    "the mass of the dynamically active disk , m@xmath158 ( table [ oort_mass ] ) , is defined here as the total mass of ejected particles plus all survivors having @xmath156 that are presumably in unstable orbits .",

    "[ fr ] displays @xmath154 and @xmath160 versus time for the @xmath161 m@xmath1 run .",
    "what is most striking is that at the end of all four runs both @xmath154 and @xmath159 vary little among the different simulations ( table [ oort_mass ] ) .",
    "this indicates that the total mass deposited in the cloud depends only on the mass of the disk that lies within the planets gravitational reach , and is not very sensitive to the orbital histories of the migrating planets .",
    "ultimately , all particles starting in the dynamically active disk are either ejected , deposited in the oort cloud , or in some instances accreted by the planets .",
    "although the latter outcome is not modeled here , impacts may be assessed _",
    "ex post facto _ using the collision probabilities of @xcite . after summing the probability of each particle striking each planet ,",
    "we find that @xmath162 of the 1000 particles would have struck the giant planets during each simulation , with roughly half of these impactors striking jupiter . such impacts would have contributed no more than @xmath163 to any planet s mass , so the neglect of particle  planet collisions is justified .",
    "it is also worth noting that a few percent of the disk passes through the terrestrial zone , as is indicated by the @xmath164 curve of fig .",
    "[ fr ] which shows the instantaneous disk fraction having perihelia inside of 3.5 au . in these simulations",
    "typically @xmath165 of all disk particles have brief episodes with @xmath44 au .",
    "these findings are consistent with earlier studies showing that planetesimals scattered during the epoch of disk  clearing and planet  migration may have contributed significant numbers of impactors during the late heavy bombardment of the terrestrial planets ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "table [ oort_mass ] shows that in the four simulations the active disks are depleted by a factor @xmath166 after @xmath120 years .",
    "it should be noted that the family of @xmath167 curves is described well by a power ",
    "law @xmath168 .",
    "this indicates that a fully evolved system having @xmath169 requires an integration lasting the duration of the disk s dynamical lifetime @xmath170 years , which is beyond our computational means .",
    "however it is straightforward to extrapolate the formation of the oort cloud from the simulations at hand .",
    "[ fr ] shows that the ratio @xmath171 remains relatively constant during the bulk of the run .",
    "this relation permits an extrapolation to a fully evolved state of the system having @xmath172 , where the primes denote final extrapolated values .",
    "assuming @xmath173 over the age of the solar system , the extrapolated fractions become @xmath174 and @xmath175 ; these values are also given in table [ oort_mass ] .",
    "since these disk fractions are both number as well as mass fractions , the extrapolated planetesimal mass that is initially deposited in the inner oort cloud is @xmath176 .",
    "however the galactic tide will subsequently strip away comets that diffuse past @xmath177 au , and passing stars will eject others .",
    "numerical studies show that these external perturbations acting over the age of the solar system will reduce the oort cloud mass to about a third of its initial value ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus the final oort cloud mass reported in table [ oort_mass ] is @xmath178 , and is also displayed as the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ moc ] as a function of the initial disk mass @xmath94 .    the nebula origin of the oort cloud is given by the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ oc_origin ] , which shows a histogram of the oort cloud particles initial semimajor axes for the @xmath117 m@xmath1 disk ; after @xmath120 years , the planetary configuration in this system most resembles the solar system .",
    "since the inner edge of our model disks is truncated at 10 au , any oort cloud mass originating in interior orbits is still unaccounted for .",
    "we estimate this contribution after the fact by evolving a system of four giant planets in their present configuration plus an annulus of 153 massless test particles having an initial @xmath179 surface number density between @xmath180 au .",
    "their oort cloud contribution is given by the dashed curves in figs .",
    "[ moc ] and [ oc_origin ] .",
    "evidently , all parts of the giant planet domain contribute mass to the oort cloud .",
    "these findings are in agreement with @xcite who reported that a small fraction of oort cloud bodies can originate from orbits interior to jupiter and thus have asteroidal rather than cometary compositions .    if the initial disk had a mass @xmath181 m@xmath1 ( section [ migration ] ) , then fig .",
    "[ moc ] indicates that the resulting oort cloud mass is @xmath182 m@xmath1 .",
    "this mass estimate must be qualified for two reasons .",
    "for the lower  mass disks , @xmath183 m@xmath1 , the mass estimate @xmath184 as given in fig .",
    "[ moc ] is likely an underestimate , because in deriving it we have not accounted for the possibility that neptune can migrate deeper into the disk as the system evolves further on timescales longer than @xmath185 myr , thus allowing additional material to be injected into the oort cloud .",
    "( this does not affect the higher disk  mass simulations since neptune s gravitational reach has already swept across the entire disk in the higher  mass runs . ) for the higher  mass disks , @xmath184 is likely overestimated in fig .",
    "[ moc ] because resonance trapping tends to slow planet ",
    "migration and may reduce the mass encountering the planets and thus the mass deposited in the oort cloud .",
    "we note that an oort cloud having a total mass @xmath186 m@xmath1 and a population @xmath146 comets ( @xcite ) suggests that a characteristic oort cloud comet has a radius @xmath187 km for a density @xmath188 gm/@xmath189 .",
    "although the giant planets scatter planetesimals throughout the entire solar system , a large gap in orbital phase space will develop , as illustrated by fig .  [ disk ] .",
    "this gap is easily explained via the restricted three  body problem , which shows that a planet on a circular orbit will scatter a massless body in a manner that preserves the particle s jacobi integral @xmath53 ( eq .  [ jacobi ] ) .",
    "particles originating in a cold disk in the vicinity of the planet have semimajor axes @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",
    "once scattered , these particles will have eccentricities defined by the curve @xmath192 ( fig .  [ disk ] ) , assuming @xmath193 .",
    "it has also been shown that a planet of low eccentricity will repeatedly scatter particles along a curve that approximately preserves @xmath191 ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus when several planets are present , those interior to neptune can loft particles into high  eccentricity neptune  crossing orbits and ultimately fill the @xmath194 region of phase space . those particles in the high ",
    "eccentricity @xmath195 orbits of fig .",
    "[ disk ] are referred to as the scattered disk ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the region occupied by bodies of lower eccentricity beyond @xmath12 au is sometimes referred to in recent literature as the ` classical ' kuiper belt ; the eccentric , resonant objects ( including the so - called plutinos at neptune s 3:2 resonance ) may be considered a distinct dynamical sub - class of the latter population .    although fig .",
    "[ disk ] shows the scattered and classical disks after only @xmath69 years , @xcite have integrated test particle orbits for the age of the solar system .",
    "they find that while most particles in the scattered disk are removed in less than the age of the solar system , about @xmath196 of the scattered particles survive for longer times ( perhaps by acquiring protection via the kozai mechanism ( @xcite ) or by sticking near mean  motion resonances ) . in the absence of disk ",
    "stirring by any other large distant perturbers , we note that the phase ",
    "space gap between the classical and scattered disk will persist over the age of the solar system .",
    "this gap should become evident as deeper observations begin to peer beyond neptune s 2:1 resonance .    until very recently",
    ", no kbos were known to orbit at neptune s 2:1 resonance , in apparent conflict with the prediction of the planet  migration / resonance  sweeping theory that kbo populations at the 2:1 and 3:2 should be similarly abundant and have comparable eccentricities ( @xcite ) .",
    "as this paper was being written , we learned that two kbos , 1997 sz@xmath197 and 1996 tr@xmath198 , have been identified as librating in the 2:1 neptune resonance ( @xcite ) .",
    "we note that these two kbos were formerly identified in neptune s 5:3 and 3:2 resonances , and that their orbits were revised to the 2:1 resonance only after observations spanning two and three oppositions , respectively .",
    "clearly , orbit - fitting biases and observational incompleteness remain in the current census of the kuiper belt . a robust test of the planet ",
    "migration / resonance  sweeping theory requires a larger observational sample of reliable kbo orbits .",
    "@xcite offer an alternative explanation for the structure in the kuiper belt .",
    "they suggest that if a stationary neptune had scattered a couple of earth  mass planetesimals",
    "( e.g. , lnsps = large neptune  scattered planetesimals ) outwards , these massive bodies could have stirred up kbo eccentricities to @xmath199 , similar to those observed for kbos at neptune s 3:2 resonance .",
    "gravitational scattering can indeed insert kbos into , as well as remove objects from , mean  motion resonances , but scattered objects tend to librate at resonance with such large amplitudes that close encounters with neptune become possible and long  term orbital stability is precluded ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore an additional sequence of collisions and/or scattering events is required in order for particles to diffuse to stable , low ",
    "amplitude librating orbits .",
    "only the fortunate few would survive this process , so the yield of kbos scattered into stable @xmath199 orbits at the 3:2 resonance would be much smaller than that which might otherwise be acquired by means of adiabatic orbit expansion and resonance  sweeping by neptune .",
    "@xcite also point to the @xmath16 kbos that reside between the 3:2 and 2:1 resonances as additional evidence for lnsps .",
    "but resonance capture is not entirely efficient , and similar eccentricities are also achieved as neptune s orbit expands and its 2:1 resonance sweeps across the disk and stirs up eccentricities ( fig .",
    "[ disk ] ) .",
    "a census of kbos beyond neptune s 2:1 resonance ( at 48 au ) would permit an evaluation of possible stirring by hypothetical lnsps .",
    "if the natal planetesimal disk does extend past 48 au , then fig .",
    "[ disk ] shows that planet migration will produce a stirred zone interior to the 2:1 yet leave the disk exterior to the 2:1 relatively undisturbed .",
    "however , an abundant population of eccentric kbos beyond the 2:1 would suggest a history of additional stirring by other unseen perturbers ( though this would not preclude an episode of planet  migration ) .",
    "as noted earlier , our simulations neglect the planetesimal disk s self  gravity in order to inhibit an unphysical degree of self  stirring .",
    "the consequences of disk self ",
    "gravity could be better studied only by simulating disks composed of many more lower  mass particles . in this section ,",
    "we discuss the possible consequences of the disk s self  gravity .    if the local disk mass exceeds the mass of a nearby planet ( as is the case for neptune in most of the simulations considered here ) , it is the disk s gravity that can control the rates at which the perihelia and nodes of both the planet and the disk particles precess and/or regress ( @xcite ) .",
    "secular resonances are sites in the disk where a planet s perihelion / node varies at the same rate as the disk particles , and large eccentricities and inclinations can get excited at these resonances . as planets sculpt the disk and cause its surface density to evolve over time , the location and strength of secular resonances will shift .",
    "although radial drifts in the location of secular resonances might alter the details of how a planet depletes the disk as it excites particles into crossing orbits , this issue is likely of lesser importance when compared to the mean  motion resonances .",
    "in particular , a planet that is embedded in a self  gravitating disk can launch spiral density waves at its mean  motion resonances .",
    "numerous examples of this phenomenon exist in saturn s rings which exhibit density waves driven by orbiting satellites .",
    "the gaps in these rings reveal a history of angular momentum exchange between ring material and satellites , and similar exchanges are expected of planet  forming systems . when neptune launches density waves at an exterior @xmath124 mean  motion resonance , the disk exerts the torque @xmath200 on the planet which opposes its radial migration ( @xcite ) : @xmath201 here , @xmath202 is the planet s forcing function , @xmath203 is the planet s mass in solar units , @xmath204 is the disk s mean motion , @xmath205 is the frequency difference from exact resonance which has the gradient @xmath206 , and the preceding quantities are evaluated at resonance @xmath207 where @xmath62 and @xmath48 are the planet s semimajor axis and mean motion ( @xcite ) .",
    "the dimensionless ` disk mass ' is @xmath208 for the disk simulations that have @xmath209 m@xmath210/au@xmath211 .",
    "figure [ torque ] sums the torques @xmath200 due to neptune s outer @xmath212 to 5 resonances for comparison with the non  resonant torque @xmath213 that drives neptune s orbit expansion .    evidently",
    ", the resonant disk torques can inhibit neptune s outward migration if the disk admits a wave response at the @xmath214 resonances .",
    "it should be noted that these torques are also operative in non  self  gravitating disks ( @xcite ) , and similar torques also slow orbit expansion when resonance trapping is effective ( section [ back_torque ] ) .",
    "but when trapping is not of concern , the resonant torques in a non  gravitating disk shut off once particle eccentricities get excited ( @xcite ) .",
    "however in a self  gravitating particle disk , density waves transport the planet s forced disturbance downstream of the resonance in the direction of the planet s orbit . as long as wave action",
    "is sustained , particles at resonance maintain low eccentricities and the resonant disk torque can oppose planet ",
    "migration .",
    "there are two ways in which the propagation of density waves might be inhibited in particle disks . in a disk that is populated by comet ",
    "sized ( or larger ) planetesimals , dissipative forces such as gas drag or viscosity due to inter - particle collisions are insufficient to damp out density waves ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this case ,",
    "density waves reflect at a @xmath215barrier in the disk and return to the launch zone where they are reabsorbed by the particles at resonance ( @xcite ) .",
    "this absorption of the returning waves energy will steadily heat the disk and can eventually shut off subsequent wave generation . a second way to defeat waves",
    "is via stirring by larger bodies which also heats the disk and inhibits wave propagation .",
    "consequently , the resonant torque that the particle disk exerts on neptune will delay the onset of orbit expansion until the disk becomes too stirred to sustain density waves at its @xmath214 resonances .",
    "the existence of the oort comet cloud as well as the kuiper belt suggest that there was once a residual planetesimal disk of mass @xmath0100 m@xmath1 in the vicinity of the giant planets following their formation .",
    "further , any inefficiencies in the formation of the giant planets cores implies additional disk mass .",
    "the eventual clearing of this planetesimal population involves a substantial exchange of orbital energy and angular momentum with the planets , implying that the present locations of the giant planets are not necessarily their formative ones .",
    "we have numerically simulated the evolution of a system of four giant planets embedded in a planetesimal disk of mass ranging from @xmath216 to @xmath217 .",
    "our numerical simulations show a gradual increase in the mutual separation of the planets orbits as the disk is dispersed via gravitational scattering by the planets .",
    "higher disk masses yield planetary orbital migration that is faster and larger in magnitude .",
    "if planet  migration and resonance  trapping is invoked to explain the eccentricities of pluto and its cohort of kuiper belt objects at neptune s 3:2 mean  motion resonance , then these simulations show that a disk mass of order @xmath3 m@xmath1 is required to expand neptune s orbit the requisite distance of @xmath4 au to pump up plutino eccentricities to @xmath5 .",
    "such an episode of planet migration implies that the initial solar system was more compact in the past , with the jupiter  neptune separation having been smaller by about @xmath6 .",
    "this finding also confirms the disk mass estimate previously obtained by @xcite .    our model disk ",
    "planet systems behave similarly to other disk systems that experience a gravitational or viscous torque ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , which causes angular momentum to be carried radially outwards ( in this application , by the outer three planets ) while disk particles deliver mass radially inwards .",
    "however these particles tend to get ejected upon reaching jupiter s orbit , which accounts for that planet s slight orbital decay .",
    "since our simulations neglected the disk s self  gravity , collective effects such as density waves are precluded .",
    "a planet embedded in a self  gravitating planetesimal disk will tend to launch spiral density waves at its resonances .",
    "the torque due to wave generation is sufficient to oppose neptune s orbit expansion as long as the disk remains dynamically cold enough to admit a wave response from its @xmath218 or higher resonances .",
    "such an episode of wave generation will delay the onset of planet migration until the disk s wave response is defeated .",
    "the bulk of the disk particles deposited in the oort cloud originate in the vicinity of the saturn ",
    "neptune region of the solar nebula .",
    "assuming that galactic tides and passing stars decouple particles from the planetary system when they achieve a semimajor axis of @xmath30 au , and that these perturbations also remove about two  thirds of the oort cloud over the age of the solar system ( @xcite ) , we estimate that about @xmath219 m@xmath1 of the @xmath117 m@xmath1 disk is initially emplaced in the oort cloud , of which @xmath8 m@xmath1 will persist to the present age of the solar system .",
    "due to the fact that the disks simulated here were sparsely populated by particles having masses @xmath950.2 m@xmath1 , their vigorous scattering caused the planets orbits to evolve non  adiabatically such that resonance trapping of kbos was inhibited .",
    "however previous studies have shown that adiabatic orbit expansion by neptune can account for the abundance of eccentric kbos that are known to orbit at neptune s 4:3 , 3:2 , 5:3 , and 2:1 mean  motion resonances ( @xcite ) . unless there are ( or were ) additional unseen , distant perturbers , any primordial kbos beyond neptune s 2:1 resonance should reside in nearly circular , low  inclination orbits .    the planet  migration / resonance trapping phenomenon might also have applications in extrasolar planetary systems",
    ". the most visible component of an extrasolar planetary system is likely its dust , which should be most abundant when planets and planetesimals are colliding , accreting , and eroding .",
    "dusty circumstellar disks and rings are known to orbit the stars @xmath220 pictoris , formalhaut , hr 4796a , 55 cancri , and @xmath221 eridani ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in some of these systems , collisions and/or radiation forces",
    "will remove the observed dust on a timescale shorter than the age of the parent star .",
    "the presence of dust thus suggests an additional source  perhaps dust generation due to collisions by unseen planetesimals that reside in the disk .",
    "any planets that might form within this environment will deplete the disk region that lies within their gravitational reach , which could account for these disks central gaps .",
    "however an episode of planetesimal disk  clearing would also drive planet  migration , which can concentrate planetesimals at the outermost planet s exterior",
    "mean  motion resonances .",
    "since the collision frequency and hence the dust generation rate varies as the square of the planetesimal density , one might speculate that this mechanism is also responsible for the formation of dust rings observed around @xmath221 eridani , formalhaut , and hr 4796a .",
