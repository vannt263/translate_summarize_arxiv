    "the connected sum , the disjoint sum , and cabling are well - known operations on links . as pointed out by eisenbud and neumann @xcite , these are special cases of an operation which they call _ splicing_. informally , the splice of two links @xmath0 and @xmath1 along components @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the link @xmath4 obtained by pasting the exterior of @xmath5 and the exterior of @xmath6 along their boundary torus ( see section [ section : prel ] for a precise definition ) .",
    "but splicing is not only a natural generalization of classical operations .",
    "indeed , eisenbud and neumann gave the following reinterpretation of the jaco - shalen and johannson splitting theorem : any irreducible link in an integral homology sphere can be expressed as the result of splicing together a collection of seifert links and hyperbolic links , and the minimal way of doing this is unique ( see ( * ? ? ? * theorem 2.2 ) ) .",
    "given such a natural operation , it is legitimate to ask how invariants of links behave under splicing .",
    "eisenbud and neumann gave the answer for several invariants , including the multivariable alexander polynomial ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5.3 ) ) .",
    "for an oriented ordered link @xmath7 with @xmath8 components in an integral homology sphere , this invariant is an element of the ring @xmath9 $ ] , well - defined up to multiplication by @xmath10 for integers @xmath11 .",
    "now , there exists a refinement of the alexander polynomial called the _ conway function _ , which is a well - defined rational function @xmath12 .",
    "this invariant was first introduced by conway in @xcite and formally defined by hartley @xcite for links in @xmath13 .",
    "the extension to links in any integral homology sphere is due to turaev @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we give a closed formula for the conway function of a splice @xmath7 in terms of the conway function of its splice components @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this result can be considered as a refinement of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5.3 ) .",
    "as applications , we refine well - known formulae of seifert , torres , and sumners - woods .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ section :",
    "prel ] , we define the splicing and the conway function as a refined torsion . section [ section : res ] contains the statement of the main result ( theorem [ thm ] ) and a discussion of several of its consequences ( corollaries [ cor:1 ] to [ cor:4 ] ) .",
    "finally , section [ section : pr ] deals with the proof of theorem [ thm ] .",
    "in this section , we begin by recalling the definition of the splicing operation as introduced in @xcite .",
