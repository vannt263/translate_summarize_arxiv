    "@xcite statics and dynamics in heisenberg magnets was studied in 1980s , in particular by the group of kosevich @xcite .",
    "typically , the vortex is considered as a rigid particle without internal degrees of freedom ; such a vortex undergoes a so - called gyroscopic dynamics in the framework of thiele - like equations @xcite . using a rigid vortex dynamics a number of dynamical effects",
    "were studied , for a review see ref .",
    "cycloidal oscillations around the mean vortex trajectory can be explained by taking into account changes of the vortex shape due to its velocity @xcite .",
    "the rigid approach also fails when considering the vortex dynamics under the influence of a strong or fast external force .",
    "in particular , it is known that external pumping excites internal modes in vortex dynamics in heisenberg magnets , whose role is important for understanding the switching phenomena @xcite , and the limit cycles in vortex dynamics @xcite .",
    "very recently we have found that under the action of a magnetic field , or , alternatively , under the action of a spin current on a vortex state nanodot , the vortex core magnetization ( polarity ) can be switched .",
    "this effect was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite analytically and confirmed numerically by direct spin - lattice simulations for heisenberg magnets . however , the presence of the long - range dipolar interaction crucially changes the vortex dynamics @xcite , because this interaction creates an effective nonhomogeneous anisotropy @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to consider the generic properties of polarity switching in magnetic nanodots .",
    "the magnetic energy of nanodots consists of two parts : heisenberg exchange and dipolar interactions    @xmath3    here @xmath4 is a unit vector which determines the spin direction at the lattice point @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the exchange length ( @xmath7 is the exchange constant , @xmath8 is the vacuum permeability , @xmath9 is the saturation magnetization ) , the vector @xmath10 connects nearest neighbors , and @xmath11 is a unit vector .",
    "the lattice constant is chosen as a unity length .",
    "it is known that as a result of the competition between the exchange and the dipolar interactions the ground state of a thin magnetically soft nanodisk is a vortex state : the magnetization lies in the xy disk plane in the main part of the disk and is parallel to the disk edge , forming the magnetic flux - closure pattern characterized by the vorticity @xmath12 . at the disk center",
    "the magnetization distribution forms a vortex core , which is oriented either parallel or antiparallel to the z - axis .",
    "the former is characterized by a polarity @xmath13 and the latter by @xmath14 .",
    "the spin dynamics of the system is described by the modified landau ",
    "gilbert equation @xmath15 here the overdot indicates the derivative with respect to the dimensionless time @xmath16 with @xmath17 , @xmath18 is a damping coefficient .",
    "the last term is a spin torque due to external forces , which results in a magnetic field @xmath19 . in the presence of the homogeneous rotating field @xmath20 , the dimensionless field    [ eq : b ] @xmath21 here and below all frequencies",
    "are measured in units of @xmath22 , and all distances in units of @xmath23 .",

    "in the case of weak dipolar interactions , the characteristic exchange length @xmath23 is larger than the lattice constant @xmath35 , so that in the lowest approximation in the small parameter @xmath36 and weak gradients of magnetization @xmath37 we can use the continuum approximation for the hamiltonian .",
    "@xmath38,\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the normalized magnetostatic field , which comes from the dipolar interaction @xcite . in",
    "we suppose that the magnetization distribution does not depend on the @xmath40-component ( which is valid for thin disks ) and we have normalized the energy by the disk thickness @xmath29 .",
    "let us consider a cylindric nanoparticle of top surface radius @xmath41 and thickness @xmath29 . for small size nanoparticles the ground state is uniform",
    "; it depends on the particle aspect ratio @xmath42 : thin nanodisks are magnetized in the plane ( when @xmath43 @xcite ) and thick ones along the axis ( when @xmath44 ) .",
    "when the particle size exceeds some critical value , typically @xmath45 @xcite , the magnetization curling becomes energetically preferable due to the competition between the exchange and dipolar interactions . for a disk - shaped particle",
    "there appears the vortex state . for thin enough disks the vortex structure",
    "does not depend on the @xmath40-coordinate of the disk and the magnetization distribution for the vortex , which is situated in the disk center , is determined by the expressions @xcite    [ eq : vortex - ansatz-1 - 2 ] @xmath46 here @xmath47 is the coordinate in the disk plane , @xmath12 is the vortex @xmath48 topological charge ( vorticity ) , @xmath49 characterizes the vortex chirality , and @xmath50 determines the direction of the vortex core magnetization ( polarity ) .",

    "the @xmath56-field has the form @xmath57 such a form of the @xmath56field satisfies the laplace equation , so it describes the planar vortex dynamics ( neglecting the z - component of magnetization ) for the infinite heisenberg magnets .",
    "the finite size effects for the circular heisenberg magnet can be described by the image - vortex ansatz @xcite .",
    "moreover , one has to take into account the long - range dipolar interactions , which lead in general to integro - differential equations @xcite . for a thin ferromagnet",
    "the dipolar interactions produce an effective uniaxial anisotropy of the easy - plane type caused by the faces surface magnetostatic charges @xcite and an effective in - plane anisotropy caused by the edge surface charges ( surface anisotropy ) @xcite . due to the surface",
    "anisotropy the magnetization near the disk edge is constrained to be tangential to the boundary , which prevents its precession near the edge ( absence of surface charges ) @xcite .",

    "the vortex starts to move .",
    "if such forces are weak , the vortex behaves like a particle during its evolution .",
    "such rigid vortex dynamics can be well - described using the thiele approach @xcite . following this approach we use the traveling wave ansatz @xmath60 , where the function @xmath61 on the right  hand side describes the vortex shape .",
    "this results in a force balance equation @xmath62 .",
    "the first term @xmath63 $ ] is a gyroscopical force @xcite , which acts on a moving vortex in the same way as the magnetic field influences a charged particle by a lorentz force .",
    "the second term is a dissipative force @xmath64 with @xmath65 , and the last term is an external force @xmath66 , where the total energy is described by eq .  .",
    "the magnetostatic part of this force is caused mainly by magnetostatic energy of volume charges . for small displacements",
    "@xmath67 from the disk origin and small aspect ratios ( @xmath68 ) , it can be found analytically that @xmath69 @xcite with @xmath70 @xcite . for finite @xmath71 one can use the analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite , which results in @xmath72 .",
    "finally the force balance condition takes the form of a thiele equation @xmath73 = { \\bm{f}}^{\\text{ext } } - \\eta \\dot{{\\bm{r } } } - \\omega_g { \\bm{r}}.\\ ] ] without dissipation and external force this equation describes a gyration of the vortex around the disk origin with a frequency @xmath74 .",
    "the dissipation damps the possible circular motion of the vortex .",
    "however , an external force can excite a non - decaying vortex motion .",
    "for example , it is known that the rotating magnetic field can excite a circular rotation of the vortex in a heisenberg magnet @xcite and a nanomagnet @xcite due to the force @xcite    [ eq : force ] @xmath75\\sin(\\phi-\\omega\\tau)\\!\\bigr\\}.\\ ] ] in the case of electrical current influence the circular vortex dynamics can be excited by the force @xcite : @xmath76.\\ ] ]    note that the vortex motion can be excited by any small magnetic field @xmath77 @xcite ; howeber , to excite the vortex motion by a spin current , its intensity should exceed threshold value @xcite .",
    "in order to check the analytical predictions about the driven vortex dynamics , we have performed numerical simulations . in the case of a rotating magnetic field",
    "we used the micromagnetic simulator for landau - lifshitz - gilbert equations @xcite as described in ref .",
    "@xcite . to study the vortex dynamics under the action of a spin - polarized electrical current",
    ", we used numerical simulations of the discrete spin - lattice eq .   with the spin torque given by eq .",
    "as described in refs .",
    "@xcite . in both cases , as initial condition we use the vortex with positive polarity ( @xmath13 ) , centered at the disk origin . to identify precisely the vortex position we use , similar to ref .",
    "@xcite , the crossection of isosurfaces @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "let us start with the case of a spin current .",
    "if we apply the current , whose polarization is parallel to the vortex polarity ( @xmath80 ) , the vortex does not quit the disk center , which is a stable point . however , if the spin current has the opposite direction of the spin polarization ( @xmath81 , @xmath13 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 in our case ) the vortex motion can be excited when the current intensity is above a threshold value @xcite as a result of the balance between the pumping and damping . following the spiral trajectory",
    ", the vortex finally reaches a circular limit cycle .",
    "the rotation sense of the spiral is determined by the gyroforce , i.e. by the topological charge @xmath84 , which is a clockwise rotation in our case . at some value , the radius becomes comparable with the system size @xmath41 and the vortex dynamics becomes more complicated and can not be described by the thiele equation .",
    "finally it results in a switching of the vortex core , see below .",
    "a qualitatively similar picture is found in the case of a rotating field with angular frequency directed opposite to the vortex polarity : @xmath85 .",
    "there exist different regimes in the vortex dynamics @xcite . in the range of frequencies close to the frequency of the orbital vortex motion ( @xmath86 ghz )",
    "the vortex demonstrates a finite motion in a region near the disk center along a quite complicated trajectory and does not switch its polarity .",
    "these cycloidal vortex oscillations are similar to those in ref .",
    "@xcite , and correspond to the excitation of higher magnon modes during the motion . if @xmath87 , then for weak fields the vortex motion can be considered as a sum of two constituents : ( i ) the gyroscopic orbital motion as without field , and ( ii ) cycloidal oscillations caused by the field influence . for the case",
    "@xmath88 the direction of the cycloidal oscillations coincides with the direction of the field rotation , while the direction of the gyroscopic orbital motion is opposite to it . for stronger fields the vortex motion becomes more complicated and its average motion can be directed even opposite to the gyroscopical motion ( this situation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : v_av_nv ] ) .",
    "the irreversible switching of the vortex polarity can be excited in a specific range of parameters @xmath89 , with typical frequencies about @xmath90 ghz and intensities about @xmath91 mt @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of the switching is discussed below .",
    "( a )  * t=110 ps * : the rotating field causes the vortex motion , as a result a negative dip is forming .",
    "( b )  * t=320 ps * : a vortex - antivortex pair has been born in region 1 .",
    "( c )  * t=420 ps * : the vortex pair has annihilated in region 2 , after some time a new vortex - antivortex pair is born in region 3 .",
    "( d )  * t=495 ps * : the new antivortex has annihilated with the old vortex in region 4 and only the new vortex of opposite polarity remains .",
    "the mechanism of the vortex switching is of general nature ; it is essentially the same in all systems where the switching was observed @xcite . under the action of pumping , the original vortex ( v , @xmath92 ) , situated in the disk center , moves along a spiral trajectory in the case of a current or along a more complicated trajectory ( as described in the previous section ) in the case of the rotating field . during its motion ,",
    "the vortex excites a number of spin waves @xcite .",
    "mainly magnon modes of two kinds are excited in this system : symmetrical and azimuthal ones @xcite . due to the continuous",
    "pumping the system goes to the nonlinear regime : the amplitude of the azimuthal mode increases and there appears an out - of - plane dip nearby the vortex , see fig .",
    "[ fig : v_av_nv](a ) . when the amplitude of the out - of - plane dip reaches its minimum [ @xmath93 , fig .",
    "[ fig : v_av_nv](b ) ] a pair of a _ new _ vortex ( nv , @xmath94 ) and antivortex ( av , @xmath95 ) is created .",
    "these three objects move following complicated trajectories which result from thiele - like equations .",
    "the directions of the motion of the partners are determined by the competition between the gyroscopical motion and the external forces , which are magnetostatic force @xmath96 , pumping force @xmath97 , see eqs .  , and the interactions between the vortices @xmath98 .",
    "the magnetostatic force for the three body system can be calculated , using the image vortex approach , which corresponds to fixed ( dirichlet ) boundary conditions . for the vortex state nanodisk such boundary conditions results from the magnetostatic interaction , which is localized near the disk edge @xcite .",

    "the interaction force @xmath104 between vortices is a 2d coulomb force @xmath105 .",
    "the internal gyroforces of the dip impart the initial velocities to the nv and av , which are perpendicular to the initial dip velocity and have opposite directions . in this way",
    "the av gains the velocity component directed to the center , where the v is moving .",
    "this new - born pair is a topologically trivial @xmath106 pair , which undergoes a kelvin motion @xcite .",
    "this kelvin pair collides with the original vortex . if the pair was born far from v then the scattering process is semi ",
    "elastic ; the new - born pair is not destroyed by the collision . in the exchange approach",
    "this pair survives , but it is scattered by some angle @xcite . due to additional forces ( pumping , damping and magnetostatic interaction ) , the real motion is more complicated and the kevin pair can finally annihilate by itself , see fig .  [ fig : v_av_nv](c ) .",

    "the switching picture involving the creation and annihilation of a vortex - antivortex pair is very general and does not depend on the details how the vortex dynamics was excited . in particular , such a switching mechanism can be induced by a field pulse @xcite , by an ac oscillating @xcite or rotating field @xcite , by an in - plane electrical current ( nonhomogeneous spin torque ) @xcite and by a perpendicular current ( homogeneous spin torque ) @xcite .",
