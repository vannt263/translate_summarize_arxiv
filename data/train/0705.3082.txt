    "a broad enhancement @xmath0 with @xmath6 was observed by bes collaboration in @xmath7 invariant mass spectrum in the @xmath8 channel @xcite .",
    "its resonance parameters are @xmath9 mev .",
    "the branching ratio is @xmath10\\cdot b[x(1576)\\to k^{+}k^{-}]=(8.5\\pm 0.6^{+2.7}_{-3.6})\\times 10^{-4}$ ] .",
    "its extremely large width around 800 mev motivated theoretical explanations such as a @xmath11 molecular state @xcite , tetraquark @xcite , diquark - antidiquark bound state @xcite , a composition of @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "since there are two broad overlapping resonances @xmath12 and @xmath13 with the same quantum number around 1600 mev , we investigated whether such a broad signal could be produced by the final state interaction ( fsi ) @xcite effect in our previous work @xcite .",
    "we noticed that the interference effect of @xmath2 could produce an enhancement around @xmath14 mev with the opening of the @xmath15 channel , similar to the cusp effect discussed in ref .",
    "however , the branching ratio @xmath16\\cdot b[\\rho(1450,1700)\\to k^{+}k^{-}]$ ] from the fsi effect was far less than the experimental data .",
    "it s important to point out that we considered only the contribution of the absorptive part in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recently meng and chao explored the possible assignment of @xmath17 as the @xmath18 candidate @xcite .",
    "they found the dispersive part of the fsi amplitude contributes more importantly to the hidden charm decay width of @xmath17 than the imaginary part derived in ref .",
    "@xcite because the intermediate states @xmath19 and @xmath20 lie very close to @xmath17 .",
    "motivated by the above observation , we investigate the potential role of the dispersive contribution of fsi since the @xmath15 intermediate states are rather close to @xmath2 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the formulation of @xmath21 by exchanging @xmath22 is presented in section [ sec2 ] and our numerical result and discussion in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "as shown in fig . [ kk ] , we focus on the fsi of the @xmath15 intermediate states through the exchange of the @xmath22 meson : @xmath21 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     c    in this short note , we revisit the final state interaction of the @xmath5 decay .",
    "different from our former work @xcite , we consider the additional contribution from the dispersive part .",
    "our result shows that there exists an enhancement around 1580 mev as shown in fig .",
    "[ diagrams ] .",
    "such an enhancement occurs with the opening of the @xmath15 channel .",
    "the decay width of @xmath23 from the fsi effect is a few mev only .",
    "if the width of @xmath2 is 300 mev , the branching ratio of @xmath24 is about @xmath25 . with @xmath26",
    "$ ] roughly around @xmath27 @xcite , @xmath28\\cdot b[\\rho(1450,1700)\\to ab\\to k^{+ } { k}^{-}]$ ] is about @xmath29 .",
    "the dispersive contribution enhances the branching ratio of @xmath30 by two orders than that in ref .",
    "however , such a ratio is still far less than experimental value @xmath31\\cdot b[x(1576)\\to k^{+}{k}^{-}]=(8.5\\pm 0.6^{+2.7}_{-3.6})\\times 10^{-4}$ ] , although the @xmath32 spectrum from the fsi effect of @xmath2 decays mimics the observed broad spectrum from bes s measurement .    throughout our calculation , we ignored the direct coupling between @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "recently , li argued that @xmath33 can have strong coupling with @xmath7 at the tree level @xcite . adding this contribution certainly increases the branching ratio .",
    "however , the experimental upper limit of @xmath35 $ ] is @xmath36 and @xmath34 is not one of the dominant decay modes of @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "clearly , future besiii high - statistics data around 1.6 gev in the @xmath34 channel will be very helpful in the clarification of @xmath0 .",
    "we also calculate the decay amplitude of @xmath37 using the same technique .",
    "there exists one similar enhancement around 1580 mev , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ diagrams-1 ] .",
    "this enhancement will be useful to test if x(1576 ) arises from the fsi effect .",
