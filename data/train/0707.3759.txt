    "a comparison of the frameworks underlying classical and quantum mechanics shows that the two descriptions have several common mathematical structures .",
    "however , a striking difference emerges : the classical setting is geometrical and nonlinear while the quantum is algebraic and linear .",
    "the emphasis on the underlying linearity in quantum mechanics is usually attributed to the description of the interference phenomena @xcite .",
    "therefore , the carrier space of quantum systems is required to be a hilbert space @xmath2 from the beginning .",
    "the hermitian structure is required to describe the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics . however , it is exactly this probabilistic interpretation which forces on us the identification of physical states not with the hilbert space but rather with the space of rays , i.e. the complex projective space of @xmath2 , say @xmath3 .",
    "of course @xmath4 is a genuine nonlinear manifold and on it the hermitian structure gives rise to a khler structure .",
    "the appearance of this manifold in the quantum setting calls for a geometrical formulation of quantum mechanics .",
    "it is clear that in the manifold view point we have to give up the usual `` superposition of states '' and the notion of operators , eigenvectors and eigenstates as usually presented .",
    "nevertheless , due to their physical relevance and interpretation we must be able to recover these `` attributes '' for quantum systems also at the manifold level .",
    "the overall formulation must allow for nonlinear transformations and therefore only tensorial objects should be identified with physically relevant quantities . to fully exploit the geometrical picture , one prefers to work with real differential manifolds , i.e. one replaces the complex vector space @xmath2 with its realification @xmath5 .",
    "the hermitian structure then splits into a complex structure , a symplectic structure and a riemannian structure ( compatible among them to define a khler structure ) hermitian operators are transformed into functions by replacing them by their expectation values .",
    "these functions project onto @xmath4 . with the help of the poisson tensor associated with the symplectic structure it is possible to give rise to a flow by integrating the hamiltonian vector field associated with the expectation value function corresponding to a given hermitian operator @xcite .",
    "the symplectic structure appearing in quantum mechanics makes also possible to consider it as a `` classical field theory '' associated with a lagrangian description with relativity group the galilei group @xcite , since we deal with non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "thus , classical and quantum descriptions have in common a symplectic structure .",
    "however , this is the only quantum feature that has a direct classical analogue .",
    "some characteristic features like the quantum uncertainties and state vector reduction in a measurement process are strictly related to the additional complex structure , available in quantum mechanics but not present in classical mechanics @xcite .",
    "this additional structure lies at the heart of the difference between the mathematical structures underlying the two theories , much more than the linear structure .",
    "going back to the manifold view point introduced in quantum mechanics , i.e. the identification of @xmath4 as the true manifold of physical states , we have to recover the notion of superposition of physical states @xcite .",
    "this has been done and creates a deep relation with pancharatnam connection , bargmann invariants and geometric phases @xcite .",
    "in addition we have to recover the notion of `` eigenvector '' and `` eigenvalue '' . as a matter of fact by considering the expectation value function associated with any operator we find that their critical points will correspond to eigenstates and their values at those critical points correspond to the eigenvalues . if we consider the expectation value - functions of generic operators we get complex valued functions on @xmath4 and they provide us with a @xmath6 algebra , thus paving the way for the geometrization of the @xmath6algebraic approach to quantum theories . in this latter approach usually the space of states",
    "is identified with the space of normalized positive linear functionals on the @xmath6algebra describing the quantum system . as a provisional geometrization of this approach",
    "we shall construct these spaces with the help of the momentum map associated with the symplectic action of the unitary group on the khler manifold @xmath4 .",
    "the aim of this section is to present a brief summary of the set of the geometrical tools which characterize the description of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "the first step consists in replacing the usual complex vector space structure of the hilbert space @xmath2 of a quantum system by the corresponding realification of the vector space .",
    "we shall denote as @xmath5 the resulting vector space . in this realification process the complex structure on @xmath2 will be represented by a tensor @xmath7 on @xmath5 .",
    "the natural identification is then provided by @xmath8 under this transformation , the hermitian product becomes , for @xmath9 @xmath10    to consider @xmath5 just as a real differential manifold , the algebraic structures available on @xmath2 must be converted into tensor fields on @xmath5 . to this end",
    "we have to introduce the tangent bundle @xmath11 and its dual the cotangent bundle @xmath12 .",
    "the linear structure available in @xmath5 is encoded in the vector field @xmath13 @xmath14    we can consider the hermitian structure on @xmath15 as an hermitian tensor on @xmath11 . with every vector we can associate a vector field @xmath16    therefore , the hermitian tensor , denoted in the same way as the scalar product will be @xmath17 the scalar product above is written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is now a symmetric tensor and @xmath20 a skew - symmetric one .",
    "it is also possible to write them as a pull - back by means of the dilation vector field @xmath13 as : @xmath21    the properties of the hermitian product ensure that :    * the symmetric tensor is positive definite and non - degenerate , and hence defines a riemannian structure on the real vector space . *",
    "the skew - symmetric tensor is also non degenerate , and is closed with respect to the natural differential structure of the vector space .",
    "hence , the tensor is a symplectic form .",
    "as the inner product is sesquilinear , it satisfies @xmath22 this implies @xmath23 we also have that @xmath24 , and hence that the triple @xmath25 defines a khler structure .",
    "this implies , among other things , that the tensor @xmath7 generates both finite and infinitesimal transformations which are orthogonal and symplectic .",
    "linear transformations are converted into @xmath26tensor fields by setting @xmath27 where @xmath28 the association @xmath29 is an associative algebra isomorphism .",
    "it is possible to recover the lie algebra of vector fields by setting @xmath30 .",
    "complex linear transformations will be represented by @xmath26tensor fields commuting with @xmath7 .    for finite dimensional hilbert spaces it may be convenient to introduce adapted coordinates on @xmath2 and @xmath5 .",
    "fixing an orthonormal basis @xmath31 of the hilbert space allows us to identify this product with the canonical hermitian product of @xmath32 : @xmath33 the group of unitary transformations on @xmath2 becomes identified with the group @xmath34 , its lie algebra @xmath35 with @xmath36 and so on .",
    "the choice of the basis also allows us to introduce coordinates for the realified structure : @xmath37 and write the geometrical objects introduced above as : @xmath38    if we combine them in complex coordinates we can write the hermitian structure in a simple way @xmath39 : @xmath40    in an analogous way we can consider a contravariant version of these tensors .",
    "it is also possible to build it by using the isomorphism @xmath41 associated to the riemannian tensor @xmath19 .",
    "the result in both cases is a khler structure for the dual vector space @xmath42 with the dual complex structure @xmath43 , a riemannian tensor @xmath44 and a ( symplectic ) poisson tensor @xmath45 : the coordinate expressions with respect to the natural base are :    * the riemannian structure @xmath46 * the poisson tensor @xmath47 * while the complex structure has the form @xmath48      the space of observables ( i.e. of self - adjoint operators acting on @xmath2 ) may be identified with the dual @xmath49 of the real lie algebra @xmath35 , according to the pairing between the unitary lie algebra and its dual given by @xmath50    under the previous isomorphism , @xmath49 becomes a lie algebra with product defined by @xmath51=[a , b]_-=(ab - ba)\\ ] ]    we can also transfer the jordan product : @xmath52_+=2a\\circ b = ab+ba\\ ] ] both structures are compatible . as a result , @xmath49 becomes a jordan - lie algebra ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we can also define a suitable scalar product , given by : @xmath53 which turns the space into a real hilbert space .",
    "this scalar product is the restriction of the one on @xmath54 defined as @xmath55 .    besides this scalar product is compatible with the lie - jordan structure in the following sense : @xmath56 , b\\rangle _ { \\mathfrak{u}^*(\\hil)}=\\langle a , [ \\xi , b]\\rangle _ { \\mathfrak{u}^*(\\hil ) } \\quad \\langle [ a,\\xi]_+ , b\\rangle _ { \\mathfrak{u}^*(\\hil)}=\\langle a , [ \\xi , b]_+\\rangle _ { \\mathfrak{u}^*(\\hil)}\\ ] ]    these algebraic structures may be given a tensorial translation in terms of the association @xmath57 .",
    "however we can also associate complex valued functions with linear operators @xmath58 by means of the scalar product @xmath59    in more intrinsic terms we may write @xmath60 hermitian operators give rise thus to quadratic real valued functions .",
    "the association of operators with quadratic functions allows also to recover the algebraic structures on @xmath61 and @xmath62 by means of approapriate @xmath63tensors on @xmath5 . by using the contravariant form of the hermitian tensor @xmath64 given by : @xmath65    it is possible to define a bracket @xmath66    in particular , for quadratic real valued functions we have @xmath67    the imaginary part , i.e. @xmath68 , defines a poisson bracket on the space of functions .",
    "both brackets allow us to define a tensorial version of the lie - jordan algebra of the set of operators .    for hermitian operators we recover previously defined vector fields : @xmath69 where the vector fields associated with operators , we recall , are defined by : @xmath70    @xmath71    we can also consider the algebraic structure associated to the full bracket @xmath72 , as we associated above the jordan product and the commutator of operators to the brackets @xmath73 and @xmath68 respectively .",
    "it is simple to see that it corresponds to the associative product of the set of operators , i.e. @xmath74    this particular bilinear product on quadratic functions may be written also as a star product @xmath75 the set of quadratic functions endowed with such a structure turns out to be a @xmath6algebra .",
    "we see then that we can reconstruct all the information of the algebra of operators starting only with real - valued functions defined on @xmath5 .",
    "we have thus    the hamiltonian vector field @xmath76 ( defined as @xmath77 ) is a killing vector field for the riemannian tensor @xmath44 if and only if @xmath78 is a quadratic function associated with an hermitian operator @xmath79 , i.e. there exists @xmath80 such that @xmath81 .",
    "finally , we can consider the problem of how to recover the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operators at the level of the functions of @xmath15 .",
    "it is simple to see that    * eigenvectors correspond to the critical points of functions @xmath82 , i.e. @xmath83 * the corresponding eigenvalue is recovered by the value @xmath84    thus we can conclude that the khler manifold @xmath85 contains all the information of the usual formulation of quantum mechanics on a complex hilbert space .    up to now",
    "we have concentrated our attention on states and observables .",
    "if we consider observables as generators of transformations , i.e. we consider the hamiltonian flow associated to the corresponding functions , the invariance of the tensor @xmath44 implies that the evolution is actually unitary .",
    "it is , therefore , natural , to consider the action of the unitary group on the realification of the complex vector space .",
    "the unitary action of @xmath87 on @xmath2 induces a symplectic action on the symplectic manifold @xmath88 . by using the association @xmath89",
    "we find , with @xmath90 , that @xmath91).\\ ] ] thus if we fix @xmath92 , we have a mapping @xmath93 .",
    "thus with any element @xmath94 we have an element in @xmath62 .",
    "hence it defines a momentum map @xmath95 which provides us with a symplectic realization of the natural poisson manifold structure available in @xmath62 .",
    "we can write the momentum map from @xmath5 to @xmath49 as @xmath96    if we make the convention that the dual @xmath62 of the ( real ) lie algebra @xmath61 is identified with hermitian operators by means of a scalar product , the product pairing between hermitian operators @xmath97 and the anti - hermitian element @xmath98 will be given by @xmath99    if we denote the linear function on @xmath62 associated with the element @xmath100 by @xmath101 , we have @xmath102    the pullback of linear functions on @xmath103 is given by the quadratic functions on @xmath5 associated with the corresponding hermitian operators .",
    "it is possible to show that the contravariant tensor fields on @xmath5 associated with the hermitian structure are @xmath104related with a complex tensor on @xmath62 : @xmath105 where the two new tensors @xmath106 and @xmath107 are defined by @xmath108_+ \\rangle } _ { \\u^*}=\\frac 12 \\tr ( \\xi ( ab+ba))\\ ] ] and @xmath109_- \\rangle } _ { \\u^*}=\\frac 1{2i } \\tr ( \\xi ( ab - ba))\\ ] ]    clearly , @xmath110    as we know that @xmath62 is foliated by symplectic manifolds , we wish to consider more closely the map from @xmath5 to the minimal symplectic orbit on @xmath62 .",
    "as we have already remarked , the association of states of the quantum system with vectors in the hilbert space needs further qualifications because of the probabilistic interpretation required in quantum mechanics .",
    "more specifically , states should be identified with rays in the hilbert space , i.e. equivalence classes of vectors , orbits of non - null vectors under the action of @xmath111 .",
    "the equivalence class of the vector @xmath112 will be denoted then as @xmath113=\\ { \\lambda \\psi , \\lambda\\in \\c_0\\}\\ ] ]    as the infinitesimal generators of the real and imaginary parts of the action of @xmath114 on @xmath5 are given by the dilation vector field @xmath13 and the vector field @xmath115 respectively , it is clear that we have to undertake the projection of the relevant tensors on @xmath5 to the complex projective space or ray space @xmath116 .    without entering in too many details , we find that we have to modify @xmath44 and @xmath45 by a conformal factor to turn them into projectable tensors .",
    "specifically we have @xmath117    these tensors are projectable onto non - degenerate contravariant tensors on @xmath116 and gives rise to a lie - jordan algebra structure on the space of real valued functions whose hamiltonian vector fields are also killing vector fields for the projection @xmath118 .    as a matter of fact a theorem by wigner allows us to state that these functions are necessarily projections of expectation values of hermitian operators @xmath119    the action of the unitary group",
    "may also be projected and gives rise to a symplectic action on @xmath116 .",
    "the momentum map from @xmath5 projects onto the momentum map from @xmath116 because it is equivariant with respect to the action of @xmath120 on @xmath5 and the action of @xmath121 on @xmath62 .    from @xmath122",
    "we find @xmath123    the momentum map for the projected action may be written in the form @xmath124)=\\frac{|\\psi \\rangle \\langle \\psi | } { { \\langle \\psi , \\psi \\rangle } } = \\rho_\\psi.\\ ] ]    this map identifies @xmath125 with the hermitian operators in @xmath62 which are of rank one and are projectors , i.e. @xmath126    as the ray space is a principal bundle with base manifold @xmath116 and structure group @xmath114 , we may look for a connection one form .    the connection one - form @xmath127 is given by @xmath128 with associated curvature form @xmath129 , because the structure group is abelian .",
    "this curvature form coincides with the symplectic structure on @xmath116 arising from the projection of @xmath130 ( conformally related to @xmath107 ) .",
    "it is also possible to write the hermitian tensor which coincides with the hermitian tensor on @xmath116 when evaluated on horizontal vector fields . we thus have @xmath131    it is not difficult to see that both @xmath13 and @xmath115 are annihilated by this tensor .",
    "the embedding of @xmath125 into @xmath62 by means of the momentum map allows us to consider convex combinations of the image @xmath132 .",
    "the convex combinations will generate the space of density states , i.e. normalized positive linear functionals on the lie - jordan algebra of observables .",
    "this convex body inherits some structures from those existing on @xmath62 , which are particularly important and useful when we are interested in describing evolutions of states which are not unitary . in particular",
    "they inherits a poisson structure and a jordan structure . in the next section",
    "we shall study more closely the space of density states .",
    "as we have already remarked the space of density states is the space of positive normalized linear functionals on the real linear space of observables .",
    "a theorem by gleason @xcite asserts that these functionals may be represented by suitable operators when the trace is used as a bilinear pairing . by using this theorem",
    "we can start by considering states directly as appropriate operators .",
    "let us introduce first the space of all non - negatively defined operators , i.e. the space of all those @xmath133 which can be written in the form @xmath134 we shall denote by @xmath135 this space of operators , which is a convex cone in @xmath62 . by imposing the condition @xmath136 we select in @xmath137 the convex body of density states which we denote by @xmath0 .",
    "we shall also consider non - negative hermitian operators and density states of rank @xmath138 , and denote as @xmath139 and @xmath140 respectively the corresponding spaces .",
    "the complex projective space is in one - to - one correspondence with @xmath141 .",
    "indeed , any state in @xmath0 can be written as a convex combination of distinct states @xmath142 , with @xmath143 .",
    "we shall call * extremal states * those which can not be written in this form ( i.e. as convex combination of two @xmath144 and @xmath145 ) .",
    "the extremal states are thus given by @xmath141 .",
    "as @xmath107 and @xmath106 are not invertible in @xmath62 , it is convenient to use the pairing between @xmath61 and @xmath62 defined by the trace , to introduce two tensor fields on @xmath62 .",
    "we set then    @xmath146 defined as @xmath147_-)=\\lambda ( \\xi)(d\\hat a ) \\\\",

    "the image of @xmath106 is also a distribution , which we shall denote as @xmath150 , but in this case it is not involutive .",
    "it is possible to see that combining @xmath150 and @xmath149 we can define two distributions @xmath151 and @xmath152 which are indeed involutive .",

    "the distribution @xmath157 is involutive and the leaves are related to orbits of the following @xmath1action : @xmath158    we obtain some interesting results",
    "@xcite :    1 .",
    "the hermitian operators @xmath159 and @xmath160 belong to the same @xmath161orbit if and only if they have the same number @xmath162 of positive eigenvalues and the same number @xmath163 of negative eigenvalues ( counted with multiplicities ) .",
    "any @xmath161orbit intersecting the positive cone @xmath137 lies entirely in @xmath137 ; so that @xmath137 is stratified by the @xmath161orbits .",
    "these @xmath161orbits in @xmath137 are determined by the rank of the operator , i.e. they are exactly @xmath139 .",
    "when we restrict to the space of density states by imposing the condition @xmath164 , this @xmath161action will not preserve the states .",
    "it is however possible to define a new action that maps @xmath0 into itself by setting @xmath165    this action does preserve the rank of @xmath159 and then the following proposition holds true :    the decomposition of the convex body of density states @xmath0 into orbits of the @xmath1action @xmath166 is exactly the stratification @xmath167 into states of a given rank .",
    "the boundary of the convex body of density states consists of states of rank lower than @xmath168 , i.e. @xmath169 , and each stratum is a smooth submanifold in @xmath62 .",
    "however , the boundary @xmath170 is not smooth ( for @xmath171 ) .",
    "we have the following theorem :    every smooth curve @xmath172 through the convex body of density states is tangent , at every point , to the stratum to which it belongs , i.e. @xmath173    one may gain further insight on the `` location '' of the boundary by using the notion of `` face ''    a non - empty closed convex subset @xmath174 of a closed convex set @xmath175 is called a * face * of @xmath175 if any closed segment in @xmath175 with an interior point in @xmath174 lies entirely in @xmath174 .",
    "thus , for any @xmath176 we may consider the decomposition @xmath177 into the kernel and the image of @xmath159 .",
    "we have :    the face of @xmath0 through @xmath178 consists of states @xmath79 which are `` projectable '' with respect to the projection defined by @xmath179 , i.e. @xmath180 . the face through @xmath159 is then equivalent to @xmath181 .",
    "the inner product defined by the trace allows to define a probability transition function @xmath182 when @xmath144 and @xmath145 belong to the boundary @xmath183 , the space of extremal states .",
    "this function satisfies @xmath184 moreover , @xmath185 if and only if @xmath186 .",
    "it is not difficult to show that the hamiltonian vector fields which leave @xmath106 invariant will preserve also the probability transition functions .",
    "this result is related to a theorem by wigner and may be used to recover the space of density states starting with a poisson space carrying a compatible probability transition function .",
    "further details and a full treatement of poisson spaces with a transition probability function have been considered by landsman ( see @xcite ) .",
