    "the rapidly developing technologies of ultrashort light sources have gained wide applications in the past 10 years  @xcite , most notably with the use of attosecond pulses in time - resolved spectroscopy .",
    "a typical measurement scheme shines an extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) light pulse , in the form of an attosecond pulse train ( apt ) or a single attosecond pulse ( sap ) , together with a synchronized infrared ( ir ) laser pulse , on an atomic or molecular target , and measures the photoions , photoelectrons , or photoabsorption of the euv .",
    "the adjustable time delay between the euv and the ir gives information of the dynamics of the target .",
    "for the sap in the x - ray regime , this technique has been used to study the emission of auger electrons  @xcite in the so - called `` streaking '' model . down to the euv energy ,",
    "a similar scheme was used to time - resolve autoionization where the ir primarily just depleted the resonances excited by the euv  @xcite . for a sap at even lower energies , a series of bound states",
    "can be excited at once .",
    "these states can then be ionized by the ir through different quantum pathways to exhibit interference patterns  @xcite , or dressed by the ir temporarily to exhibit the ac stark shift  @xcite .",
    "the studies of coupled autoionizing states ( ais ) by lasers have been carried out over the past 30 years theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite . in these earlier investigations ,",
    "long pulses were used . for a typical ais with a lifetime up to tenths of femtoseconds",
    ", the coupling lights were considered to be monochromatic , and the measured spectrum was obtained by scanning the photon energy over the widths of the resonances .",
    "not until a few years ago was the same coupling scheme extended to the euv energy range with femtosecond pulses , where transient absorptions were measured or calculated  @xcite .",
    "very recently , with the emerging attosecond pulses , the timescale of the coupling has been pushed shorter than the decay lifetime of an ais  @xcite for direct observation in the time domain . in the same scheme ,",
    "numerous new spectroscopic features were suggested by simulations  @xcite . some of these features have been shown recently by experiments with improved energy resolution  @xcite of the spectrometers .",
    "further technological developments will likely bring more discoveries .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on resonant laser coupling between two aiss , where an sap passing through the medium is strongly reshaped in its spectral and temporal distributions by controlling the parameters of the laser and the medium .",
    "this reshaping of the sap , which behaves much beyond what can be described by the simple absorption rate or beer s law  @xcite , has not been investigated so far . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the actual propagation of euv pulses was studied ; however , those pulses with durations of tens of femtoseconds are too narrow in bandwidth to demonstrate any meaningful modification in the resonant spectrum . in this study",
    ", we look for how an sap evolves in the medium , which can not be revealed by a single - atom absorption cross section .    for demonstration at the single - atom model , a 200 as euv pulse and a time - delayed 9-fs laser pulse are applied to the helium atom .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 aiss are coupled by a 540-nm laser with intensities between @xmath5 and @xmath6  w/@xmath3 , where the weak euv excites @xmath7 from the ground state . for clarity ,",
    "the pulses are not distinguished as the pump or the probe since they just couple different sets of states . in the single - atom calculation , the electronic wave function , photoelectron , and euv absorption spectra are carried out for a given set of pulses and atomic parameters . in order to extract the universal features resulting from the coupling ,",
    "we further derive simple analytic forms of the spectra for short light pulses that are approximated by @xmath4 functions in time .",
    "this is a valid approximation if the pulse durations are shorter than the atomic timescales , e.g. , the 17 fs decay lifetime of @xmath7 .",
    "the fano @xmath8 parameter  @xcite preserved in the final forms of the spectra indicates how the population transfer between the aiss is controlled by the coupling and how the wave packet evolves .    for the macroscopic model ,",
    "the pulses are allowed to propagate through a 2 mm helium gas with number density @xmath9  @xmath10 ( or a pressure of 25  torr at room temperature ) .",
    "the detected euv spectra as the pulses exit the medium are calculated .",
    "we found that at certain coupling and gas conditions , an enhancement of more than 50% of the incident light at the resonance is produced in the transmission spectrum .",
    "this enhancement peak in the frequency domain persists through the propagation where the surrounding background decays along the light path .",
    "this demonstrates a remarkable extension of the nonlinear optical control to the attosecond time regime .",
    "in this section , we derive the time - dependent total wave function of a three - level autoionizing system coupled by an euv pulse and a laser pulse .",
    "two aiss , composed by the bound parts @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and the associated background continua @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively , are coupled by the laser , while the @xmath11-@xmath13 resonance is coupled to the ground state @xmath15 by the euv , both by dipole transitions .",

    "( 3 ) the matrix elements of the hamiltonian involving @xmath13 and @xmath14 are independent of energy , where we are only concerned with the energy ranges near the resonances .",
    "this means that the target structure is given in terms of the resonance energies @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the widths @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and the @xmath8 parameter of the @xmath11-@xmath13 resonance , which together constitute the basic fano lineshapes  @xcite .",

    "the procedure so far is identical to what has been employed in the early studies concerning coupled aiss  @xcite , except that we do not apply rwa on the laser pulse .    for pulses that are long compared to the resonance lifetime ,",
    "the pulse bandwidth is narrow , thus each measurement gives the ionization yield at just one single photon energy in the spectrum . in this case ,",
    "calculation of the ground - state population @xmath46 described above would be enough for carrying out the ionization spectra .",
    "however , in the present study , the bandwidth of the attosecond pulse is broad and can excite the whole ais , including a significant fraction of the background continuum .",
    "the continuum part of the wave function is needed in determining the electron or absorption spectra in a single measurement . here",
    ", the coefficients of the continuum part are retrieved from the original coupled equations @xmath47 the retrieval of the continua can be viewed as a `` correction '' after an iteration from the preliminary forms in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : adia1 ] ) and ( [ eq : adia2 ] ) .",
    "now , the time - dependent total wave function in the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : psi ] ) is completely solved .      in the following ,",
    "the electron energy spectrum and photoabsorption spectrum for a single atom are defined by the probability density per unit energy for emitting an electron and for absorbing a photon , respectively . in macroscopic cases where propagation is taken into account ,",
    "the spectroscopy is expressed in terms of the transmitted light intensity versus the photon energy .      in standard scattering theory ,",
    "the atomic scattering waves for momentum @xmath48 are given by @xmath49 in the energy - normalized form , where @xmath50 are real standing wave radial functions , and @xmath51 are the scattering phase shifts . both @xmath50 and @xmath51 are determined by the atomic potential .",
    "if one detects photoelectrons , the momentum distribution will be the projection of the total wave function at a large time onto the scattering waves , i.e. , @xmath52 likewise , if one measures the energy of the photoelectrons , the spectrum is given by @xmath53 , where @xmath54 are the scattering waves for energy @xmath55 .",
    "remember that @xmath13 and @xmath14 are conventionally chosen as standing waves , which contains both the incoming and the outgoing components . at large times , since physically the aiss will decay to the continuum , the wave packet will not have incoming components , i.e. , the projection onto scattering waves is the same as the projection onto standing waves .",
    "thus , the photoelectron spectra corresponding to the two resonances are simply @xmath56 which require us to calculate the total wave function for a physical time much longer than the decay lifetimes , until @xmath57 and @xmath58 stop evolving other than an oscillating phase .      in a given external field ,",
    "the total energy absorbed by the atom is @xmath59 where the response function @xmath60 for @xmath61 represents the absorption probability density , and is proportional to the pulse intensity in the frequency domain  @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath62 and @xmath60 have the same dimension and can be directly compared .",
    "the absorption cross section @xmath63 is related to @xmath60 by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the fine structure constant , and @xmath66 is the fourier transform of the electric field . by considering dipole interaction between the electric field and the atom , @xmath60",

    "with the wave function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : psi ] ) , the dipole moment is given by @xmath69 where the carrier frequency of the euv has been factored out , and @xmath70 note that this model aims to deal with both short and long pulse lasers . in the case of a few - cycle laser ,",
    "the fourier transform @xmath68 at very low frequencies may contain the contributions from both @xmath71 and its complex conjugate , where the separation of the carrier frequency and the envelope is not beneficial ; we thus do not employ this separation for the laser pulse in our study .    in a typical ultrafast euv - plus - ir experiment ,",
    "the electron or absorption spectra measured over variable time delays between the two pulses are the most common .",
    "photoions are also usually measured , but they do not carry additional information . to study dynamic behavior of autoionization directly in the time domain , light pulses shorter than the typical decay lifetime are necessary .",
    "by now few - cycle lasers of durations less than 10 fs are quite common . in the case",
    "where both pulses are significantly shorter than any other atomic timescale , major features of the dynamics can be recovered by assuming the pulses are @xmath4-functions in time . with this approximation , we are able to reduce the electron and absorption spectra to very simple forms in terms of the pulse areas of the euv and the laser , the time delay , and the @xmath8 parameter , where the detailed derivations are shown in the appendix .",
    "the modification brought by the laser will have maximum effects when the laser follows the euv immediately and its pulse area is @xmath72 for integer @xmath73 . in this case",
    "the photoelectron distribution flips about the resonance energy . for the light",
    ", the absorption line changes to the emission line .",
    "these dramatic changes gradually die down when the time delay increases in terms of the decay lifetime of the observed resonance .",
    "this @xmath4-pulse analysis will serve to qualitatively explain the result of realistic numerical calculation later in this article .",
    "we have shown how to model the resonance shape of an ais changed by the strong coupling laser in an atomic system . in principle , both the electron and absorption spectra carry the same essential information , depending on the resonance structure of the states and the laser parameters .",
    "however , in electron measurements , high precision spectroscopy is usually harder to achieve since the lineshape of most fano resonances requires mev energy resolution .",
    "in contrast , such resolution is easier with the transient absorption spectroscopy , as exemplified in a recent report  @xcite .",
    "thus , in the present work we will put emphasis on absorption spectroscopy .    in a linear medium , the absorption of light",
    "is commonly described by beer s law as @xmath74 , \\label{eq : beer}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are light intensities at the entrance and at the exit of the medium , respectively , @xmath77 is the number density of the particles , @xmath63 is the absorption cross section , and @xmath78 is the travel distance of light in the medium .",
    "this form requires that the cross section has no spatial and temporal dependence and is only a function of energy , and the transmission of light simply decays exponentially with its traveling distance and the gas density .",
    "however , in the presence of intense ultrashort ir pulses , the response of the medium can be more complicated , which should be carried out by propagating the exact electric field in the medium .    in the present work , by assuming",
    "that the laser is loosely focused , the electric field is a function of time @xmath79 and the spatial coordinate in the propagation direction @xmath80 only , where the dependence on the transverse direction is neglected .",
    "we assume that the propagation is only forward in @xmath80 and approximately at the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath81 . by expressing the time in the moving frame @xmath82 , the maxwell equation is reduced to @xmath83 where @xmath77 is the gas density .",
    "because the euv and laser frequencies are widely separate , they can be propagated separately .",
