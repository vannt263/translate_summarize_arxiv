    "svivon contribution to the electron bands ( discussed above ) , while the temperature - independent part is of the same origin as the nodal kink ( thus due to the qe contribution to the electron bands ) .",
    "as will be discussed below , the opening of a superconducting ( sc ) gap causes a decrease in the svivon linewidth around the energy minimum at @xmath21 , resulting in the narrowing of the stripon  svivon contribution to the antinodal electron bands below @xmath0 .",

    "the existence of high electron dos close to @xmath31 around the antinodal points is actually a consequence of the hybridization between qe s and convoluted stripon  svivon states of svivons around @xmath93 .",

    "the resonance energy at @xmath109 is higher than the maximal sc gap , and thus a sharp peak is not observed there , being too wide ( see discussion below ) ; however , sharp peaks have been observed @xcite at incommensurate @xmath114 points , where the energy is lower than the maximal sc gap . in the lbco system , the energy dependence of the peak ( whether it is sharp or wide ) with @xmath97 was also found @xcite to have branches dispersing both downward and upward around @xmath109 .",

    "these are excitations towards the destruction of the stripe - like inhomogeneities ; their width determines the speed of the inhomogeneities dynamics , and they exist for stoichiometries where sc exists @xcite . because of the lattice dressing of svivons , these double - svivon excitations are expected to be lattice - dressed spin excitations , and indeed , cu  o optical phonon modes have been found to be involved in such excitations @xcite .",

    "this vertex was also demonstrated @xcite to enable inter - stripe hopping of pairs of neighboring stripons through intermediary states of pairs of opposite - spin qe s , obtained by the exchange of svivons .",
    "the pair hopping was shown to result in a gain in inter - stripe hopping energy ( compared to the hopping of two uncorrelated stripons ) , avoiding intermediary svivon excitations .",
    "furthermore , the hybridization of the qe s with orbitals , beyond the @xmath5@xmath6@xmath7 model , results in further gain in both intra - plane and inter - plane hopping energy .",
    "this provides a pairing scheme based on transitions between pair states of stripons and qe s through the exchange of svivons .",
    "the inter - plane pair hopping , introduced within this scheme , is consistent with @xmath150-axis optical conductivity results @xcite , revealing ( in addition to the opening of the sc gap ) , the increase of the spectral weight in the mid - ir range ( well above the gap ) below @xmath0 .",
    "this effect has been observed both in bilayer and single - layer cuprates , and proposed @xcite to be the signature of a @xmath150-oriented collective mode emerging ( or sharpening ) below @xmath0 .",
    "the existence of such a mode below @xmath0 is due to the hopping of pairs in the @xmath150-direction , during their qe - pair stages , while above @xmath0 , @xmath150-axis hopping of stripons ( through intermediary qe ",
    "svivon states ) is , at the most , limited to adjacent cuo@xmath4 planes .    the pairing diagram ( sketched in ref .",
    "@xcite ) provides eliasherg - type equations , of coupled stripon and qe pairing order parameters .",
    "coherent pairing occurs @xcite between two subsets of the qe and stripon states . for qe s",
    "these subsets are , naturally , of the spin - up ( @xmath151 ) and spin - down ( @xmath152 ) qe s .",
    "since the stripons are spinless , their subsets should be determined according to a different criterion .    as was illustrated in fig .  1 , for a cuo@xmath4 plane within the @xmath5@xmath6@xmath7 model , the @xmath151 qe s can reside on @xmath152 sites , and",

    "since the qe subsets have a spatial interpretation in the cuo@xmath4 planes ( within the adiabatic time scale ) it is natural to choose the stripon subsets also on a spatial basis , in a manner which optimizes the coupled pairing .    since the pairing is optimal between neighboring stripons along the charged stripes @xcite , the stripon pairing subsets",

    "these symmetry characteristics of @xmath164 and @xmath157 are reflected in the symmetry of the physical pairing order parameter .",
    "the overall symmetry is expected to be of a @xmath1 type ; however , the sign reversal of @xmath164 through the charged stripes , and the lack of coherence in the details of the dynamic stripe - like inhomogeneities between different cuo@xmath4 planes , is expected to result in features different from those of a simple @xmath1-wave pairing ( especially when the @xmath150-direction is involved ) .",
    "there is a strong experimental support in the existence of features of @xmath1-wave pairing , though different features have been reported too .",
    "the pairing mechanism here depends on the stripe - like inhomogeneities , and is expected to be stronger when the af / stripes effects are stronger , thus closer to the insulating side of the mott transition regime .",
    "consequently one expects the pairing temperature @xmath170 to decrease with the doping level @xmath83 , as is sketched in the pairing line in fig .",
    "the existence of sc requires the existence of not only pairing , but also of phase coherence of the pairing order parameters . under conditions satisfied for low @xmath83 values , within the phase diagram of the cuprates",

    "the normal - state pg , observed in the cuprates above @xmath0 ( except for high @xmath83 values ) is a pair - breaking gap at @xmath172 ( see fig .",

    "the pairs in the pg state behave similarly to localized bipolarons , and do not contribute to electrical conductivity at low temperatures .",
    "pairing coherence requires energetic advantage of itineracy of the pairs .",
    "thus @xmath173 is expected to increase with @xmath83 , as is sketched in the coherence line in fig .",

    "the existence of a coherent three dimensional fs in this regime has been demonstrated through polar angular magnetoresistance oscillations @xcite .",
    "measurements of the in - plane optical conductivity through @xmath0 @xcite , show a bcs - type behavior in the od regime , supporting the existence of fermi - liquid normal state there ( as shown in fig .",
    "on the other hand , in the ud regime these measurements reveal the transfer , below @xmath0 , of spectral weight from high energies ( extending over a broad range up to at least 2  ev ) , to the infrared range .",
    "this behavior has been associated with the establishment of coherence @xcite . within the present approach",
    "the pg state consists of localized pairs ( and unpaired carriers ) within the hubbard gap , while the establishment of pair coherence in the sc state requires moving states from the upper and lower hubbard bands into this gap , to contribute to bloch - like states , explaining the observed transfer of spectral weight .",
    "arpes measurements on lsco thin films @xcite show that @xmath0 rises under strain , while the bands close to @xmath31 become wider .",
    "such a change in the bands is consistent with a move towards the metallic side of the mott transition regime .",
    "thus we predict that the increase in @xmath0 under that strain is due to an increase in @xmath180 , and that @xmath170 ( where the pg state sets in ) may have decreased in this case .    as is sketched in fig .",
    "6 , there is an increase in the values of @xmath181 and @xmath173 in the regime where pairing and coherence coexist , compared to their extrapolated values from the regimes where only one of them exists .",
    "this is due to the energy gain in the sc state , compared to both the pg and the fermi - liquid normal states .",
    "if the sc state is suppressed , the occurrence of a metal - insulator transition ( mit ) is expected here at @xmath2 , at the mit point in the phase diagram ( see fig .",
    "6 ) , where the metallic phase is of the fermi - liquid regime , and the insulating phase is of the pg regime of localized electrons and electron pairs within the hubbard gap . and indeed , experiments where the sc state is suppressed by a magnetic field @xcite , or by doping @xcite , show an mit at @xmath178 , at @xmath182 .",
    "this stoichiometry corresponds here to a fractional stripon occupancy of @xmath183 , as was determined from the tep results above ( see fig .",
    "the existence of the mit close to this stoichiometry is plausible , because for higher doping levels inter - atomic coulomb repulsion destabilizes the dynamic charged stripes , essential for the pg state ( though the energy gain in the sc state helps maintaining them for higher @xmath83 ) .",
    "the mit point in fig .",
    "6 is a quantum critical point ( qcp ) , and there have been various theoretical approaches addressing the existence of such a qcp .",
    "such approaches often consider different mechanisms for the sc pairing and for the driving force of the pg state , and consequently predict ( in difference with the present approach ) the existence different regimes of different symmetries , within the sc phase @xcite .",
    "this has not been confirmed by experiment , in agreement with the present approach .",
    "the existence of an intrinsic nanoscale heterogeneity of sc and pg regions @xcite will be addressed below .",
    "the connection between sc and an mit ( where the insulating state is due to localization ) in the cuprates , as well as in other systems with a similar phase diagram , has been pointed out by osofsky _",
    "the conclusion from the present approach is that if a pairing interaction exists , and the insulating state is characterized by the existence of localized pairs at low temperatures , then an sc phase , based on the same pairing interaction , ought to exist around the mit regime .",
    "the qe and stripon pairing gaps @xmath184 and @xmath185 are closely related to the order parameters @xmath164 and @xmath157 [ see eqs .  (",

    "pairing without coherence results in the pseudogap state of localized electrons and electron pairs , and coherence without pairing results in a fermi - liquid normal state .",
    "suppression of superconductivity results in a quantum critical point of a metal - insulator transition between these two states at @xmath2 .",
    "an intrinsic heterogeneity exists of nanoscale superconducting and pseudogap regions .",
