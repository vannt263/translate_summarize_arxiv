    "the ( single - species ) partially asymmetric exclusion process ( pasep ) is an important non - equilibrium model that has generated interest in many areas of mathematics .",
    "partly this is due to the existence of an exact solution ( i.e.  there are explicit formulas ) for the stationary distribution for this process , which makes it a useful example in the study of non - equilibrium processes .",
    "moreover , the pasep has a rich combinatorial structure .",
    "most notably , corteel and williams @xcite gave a beautiful combinatorial interpretation of the stationary distribution of the pasep in terms of certain tableaux called permutation tableaux , which are in bijection with several related objects , such as alternative tableaux , staircase tableaux , tree - like tableaux .",
    "the single - species pasep describes the dynamics of particles hopping on a finite one - dimensional lattice on @xmath1 sites with open boundaries , with the rule that there is at most one particle in a site , and at most one particle hops at a time .",

    "figure [ tableaux_samples ] shows examples of the alternative tableaux , the rhombic alternative tableaux , and the @xmath0-rhombic alternative tableaux . note that 2-rat are the same as rat , and 1-rat are the original alternative tableaux .    a common strategy to prove the combinatorial formula for the tableaux is to use the matrix ansatz , as in @xcite .",
    "another interesting and more direct proof of this formula is to explicitly construct a markov chain on the tableaux , and show that it projects to the markov chain of the underlying process , as in @xcite .",
    "as our final result , we construct such a markov chain on the rat that projects to the two - species pasep .",

    "the two - species partially asymmetric exclusion process ( pasep ) has been studied extensively as an interesting generalization to the single - species pasep .",
    "the two - species pasep has two species of particles , one `` heavy '' and one `` light '' .",
    "the `` heavy '' particle can enter the lattice on the left with rate @xmath18 , and exit the lattice on the right with rate @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , the `` heavy '' particle can swap places with both the hole and the `` light '' particle when they are adjacent , and the `` light '' particle can swap places with the hole .",
    "each of these possible swaps occur at rate 1 when the heavier particle is to the left of the lighter one , and at rate @xmath20 when the heavier particle is to the right ( we simplify our notation by treating the hole as a third type of `` particle '' ) .",
    "the parameters of the two - species pasep are shown in figure [ 2pasep_parameters ] , where the  represents the `` heavy '' particle , and the  represents the `` light '' particle .",
    "more precisely , if we denote the `` heavy '' particle by @xmath2 , the `` light '' particle by @xmath21 , and the hole by @xmath3 , and let @xmath4 and @xmath5 be any words in @xmath22 then the transitions of this process are : @xmath23    @xmath24 where by @xmath8 we mean that the transition from @xmath4 to @xmath5 has probability @xmath9 , @xmath1 being the length of @xmath4 ( and also @xmath5 ) .",
    "notice that since only the `` heavy '' particle can enter or exit the lattice , the number of `` light '' particles must stay fixed .",
    "in particular , if we fix the number of `` light '' particles to be 0 , we recover the original pasep .",
    "uchiyama provides a matrix ansatz along with matrices that satisfy the conditions , to express the stationary probabilities of the 2-species pasep as a certain matrix product .",

    "<S> we study a generalization of the partially asymmetric exclusion process ( pasep ) in which there are @xmath0 species of particles of varying weights hopping right and left on a one - dimensional lattice of @xmath1 sites with open boundaries . in this process </S>",
    "<S> , only the heaviest particle type can enter on the left of the lattice and exit from the right of the lattice . in the bulk </S>",
    "<S> , two adjacent particles of different weights can swap places . </S>",
    "<S> we prove a matrix ansatz for this model , in which different rates for the swaps are allowed . based on this matrix ansatz </S>",
    "<S> , we define a combinatorial object which we call a @xmath0-rhombic alternative tableau , which we use to give formulas for the steady state probabilities of the states of this @xmath0-species pasep . </S>",
    "<S> we also describe a markov chain on the 2-rhombic alternative tableaux that projects to the 2-species pasep .     + olya mandelshtam </S>"
