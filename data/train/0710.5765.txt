    "furthermore , since almost none of the absorbing galaxies were observed above the @xmath29 boundary and that almost none of the non  absorbing galaxies were observed below the @xmath29 boundary , s95 inferred that _ all _ @xmath36 galaxies are hosts to absorbing gas halos characterized by a covering fraction of unity and a spherical geometry which truncates at @xmath29 .",

    "they found @xmath38  kpc .    using a reverse approach of establishing foreground galaxy redshifts and then searching for absorption in the spectra of background quasars yields results inconsistent with a covering fraction of unity .",

    "thus , our sample is consistent with a holmberg  like luminosity relationship in the case @xmath168 .    a central issue to",
    "this discussion is whether there is a fundamental physical difference between the halos of non  absorbing ( weak ) and absorbing galaxies or whether the difference in @xmath85 arise only from a chance intersection of the quasar line of sight through a single gas cloud or a gas cloud complex in these halos . even if weak @xmath169   systems are similar to strong systems , and differ only by the number of clouds intersected along the quasar line of sight , our arguments for constraining the halo gas covering fraction for @xmath3   still hold .",
    "strong absorbers are typically characterized by a dominant and blended subsystem and accompanied by significantly weaker subsystems at relative velocities ranging from @xmath170 to @xmath171  km  s@xmath172 @xcite .",
    "in fact , there may be different physical processes governing the @xmath85 distribution of weak absorption associated with strong absorbers and the general population of weak absorbers .",

    "these facts suggest that lines of sight through galaxy halos often probe a dominant , more massive structure surrounded by smaller fragments of gas ; a scenario consistent with patchy halos , in which some lines of sight near galaxies would be expected to probe only @xmath174   weak absorption .",
    "there is also the possibility that some of the galaxies in our sample having redshifts consistent with those of the absorbers may not be the primary structure responsible for the absorption . in some cases there could be a faint unidentified galaxy located directly in front of the quasar that can not be identified even with careful point  spread subtraction of the quasar ( see * ? ? ?",
    "thus , our estimated values of @xmath0 and @xmath50 could be slightly skewed toward smaller and larger values , respectively .",
    "it is difficult to quantify this affect since such putative faint galaxies could actually be companions to the galaxies in our sample .",
    "in conclusion , the gas covering fraction must be less than unity since the observed impact parameter distribution of absorbing galaxies does not fall exclusively within the statistical absorber halo radius in the range of @xmath175  kpc .",
    "the fact that some absorbing galaxies are found at @xmath8 and some non  absorbing galaxies are found at @xmath176 implies @xmath58 and that the standard halo model can not describe halos on a case by case basis .",
    "this highlights the power of using the statistics of absorption line surveys to constrain the properties of halos in relation to the measured distributions in absorption selected galaxy surveys .    by quantifying how individual galaxy halos deviate from a `` standard '' halo ,",
    "we have obtained an average gas covering fraction of @xmath177 .",
    "it is possible that @xmath0 exhibits both a radial and an equivalent width dependence , though we can not address this with our sample .",
    "values of @xmath0 are likely to depend on galaxy star formation rates , and galaxy  galaxy mergers and harassment histories ; processes that give rise to patchy and geometrically asymmetric gas distributions .",
    "alternatively , the absorption properties of intermediate redshift halos may be governed by the dark matter over density , @xmath178 , and redshifts at which the galaxies formed @xcite .",
    "our results also show that , if @xmath110 , the sizes of absorbing halos can still follow a holmberg  like luminosity relation with @xmath5 in the range of @xmath11 ( s95 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which corresponds to @xmath179  kpc .",

    "* ) , a holmberg  like luminosity relation in quasar absorption line systems naturally arises @xcite .",
    "however , these models have great difficulty explaining absorption at impact parameters greater than @xmath180  kpc .",

    "<S> we deduced @xmath0 must be less than unity and obtain a mean of @xmath10 for our sample . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the data suggest halo radii of absorbing galaxies do not follow a luminosity scaling with @xmath5 in the range of @xmath11 , if @xmath12 as previously reported . however , provided @xmath13 , we find that halo radii can remain consistent with a holmberg  like luminosity relation with @xmath14 and @xmath15  kpc . </S>",
    "<S> no luminosity scaling ( @xmath16 ) is also consistent with the observed distribution of impact parameters if @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the data support a scenario in which gaseous halos are patchy and likely have non  symmetric geometric distributions about the galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest halo gas distributions may not be govern primarily by galaxy mass / luminosity but also by stochastic processes local to the galaxy . </S>"
