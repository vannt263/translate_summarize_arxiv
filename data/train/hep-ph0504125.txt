    "<S> we obtain quite small widths for the decay @xmath1 and for @xmath2 consistent with the experimental situation . for the sum of the decay widths for @xmath3 and @xmath4 we find values of the order of @xmath5 mev for pentaquarks of the characteristic size considered in this work . </S>",
    "<S> ( the experimental situation with respect to te observation of the @xmath6 is somewhat uncertain at this time . ) </S>",
    "<S> we also provide results for the decays @xmath7 and @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> our model of confinement plays an important role in our analysis and makes it possible to use feynman diagrams to describe the decay of the pentaquark . </S>"
