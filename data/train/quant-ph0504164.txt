    "so both the quadratures , @xmath109 and @xmath110 , are squeezed for a particular detuning @xmath71 and obey the weaker entanglement criterion in eq.([entanglement ] ) when the mismatch between the transmissions is less than 40@xmath0 .",
    "with further increase in transmission , the stronger criterion is also satisfied .    in fig 4(b ) , where the transmissions are equal , all the transmitted light is squeezed and entangled either weakly or strongly .",
    "the squeezing is almost ideal .",
    "however , the strong epr criteria is not satisfied till transmission is about 0.75 though the light from the opa is ideally squeezed and obeys both the epr criteria over the entire bandwidth @xmath13 .",
    "we find that the differences in transmission of the two modes adversely affect both entanglement and squeezing .",
    "this can be explained as follows . squeezing occurs due to destructive interference of phase sensitive and insensitive fluctuations .",
    "as long as the transmissions of the two modes is not equal , the magnitude of destructive interference is not enough for the light to be squeezed .",
    "the low correlation of fluctuations also causes the loss of entanglement .",
    "loss of light through absorption or filtering is a common occurrence in any real world optical experiment . up until now",
    ", the aim has been to avoid such losses in case of squeezing experiments since they lead to reduced squeezing efficiency by adding vacuum fluctuations . in this calculation",
    "we see that for two - mode squeezed light , squeezing can be preserved as long as the transmissions of the two modes are matched , even if they are less than unity . by coupling one mode into a fiber and varying it s transmission ,",
    "we can maintain two - mode squeezing in a small range of detuning within the transparency window while destroying squeezing coherence for all other detuning frequencies .",
    "here we have used an eit medium since it provides a smooth well understood transmission feature over a compact frequency bandwidth .",
    "teleportation and cryptography schemes using continuous variable entanglement in squeezed states have long been discussed in literature  @xcite .",
    "the ability to selectively preserve entanglement and squeezing can be very useful in such schemes .",
    "the experiment suggested here provides a practical method to do this .",
    "for example , if the two modes are shared between two parties , the sequence of fiber transmissions , required to reconstruct the information contained in the entanglement , could be the shared key . in the absence of the key",
    "the information can not be reliably reconstructed .",
    "further any eavesdropping , by diverting part of a transmitted mode , adds vacuum noise that is easily detectable if the message can not be reconstructed with the shared key .",
    "the eit medium , apart from providing a varying transmission also slows down the transmitted light .",
    "the effects discussed here may also be important for application of any slow light effects in such continuous variable teleportation or cryptographic schemes .",
    "in this paper we have theoretically investigated the preservation of two mode squeezing and entanglement when the transmission of the two modes are not equal .",
    "an eit medium provides varying transmission for one the modes and a fiber is used to transmit the other mode .",
    "we find that two mode squeezing is preserved as the transmission of both modes approach the same value . using the strong and weak continuous variable entanglement criteria , we find that entanglement in the weak regime is maintained whenever two mode squeezing is preserved but loss of transmission degrades entanglement in the strong regime .",
    "we have also outlined a scheme by which two mode squeezing and entanglement can be selectively maintained or destroyed using varying fiber transmissions .",
    "such a scheme , if experimentally demonstrated , can have interesting application to continuous variable quantum cryptography .",
