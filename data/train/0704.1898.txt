    "the casimir effect is among the most interesting macroscopic manifestations of vacuum fluctuations .",
    "it have important implications on all scales , from cosmological to subnuclear , and has become in recent decades an increasingly popular topic in quantum field theory .",
    "in addition to its fundamental interest the casimir effect also plays an important role in the fabrication and operation of nano- and micro - scale mechanical systems .",
    "the imposition of boundary conditions on a quantum field leads to the modification of the spectrum for the zero - point fluctuations and results in the shift in the vacuum expectation values for physical quantities such as the energy density and stresses .",
    "in particular , the confinement of quantum fluctuations causes forces that act on constraining boundaries .",
    "the particular features of the resulting vacuum forces depend on the nature of the quantum field , the type of spacetime manifold , the boundary geometries and the specific boundary conditions imposed on the field . since the original work by casimir casi48 many theoretical and experimental works",
    "have been done on this problem ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "many different approaches have been used : mode summation method with combination of the zeta function regularization technique , green function formalism , multiple scattering expansions , heat - kernel series , etc .",
    "advanced field - theoretical methods have been developed for casimir calculations during the past years @xcite . however , there are still difficulties in both interpretation and renormalization of the casimir effect .",
    "straightforward computations of geometry dependencies are conceptually complicated , since relevant information is subtly encoded in the fluctuations spectrum @xcite .",
    "analytic solutions can usually be found only for highly symmetric geometries including planar , spherically and cylindrically symmetric boundaries .",
    "recently the casimir energy has been evaluated exactly for several less symmetric configurations of experimental interest .",
    "these include a sphere in front of a plane and a cylinder in front of a plane @xcite .",
    "a great deal of attention received the investigations of quantum effects for cylindrical boundaries .",
    "in addition to traditional problems of quantum electrodynamics under the presence of material boundaries , the casimir effect for cylindrical geometries can also be important to the flux tube models of confinement @xcite and for determining the structure of the vacuum state in interacting field theories @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the vacuum energy of electromagnetic field with boundary conditions defined on a cylinder turned out to be technically a more involved problem than the analogous one for a sphere .",
    "first the casimir energy of an infinite perfectly conducting cylindrical shell has been calculated in ref . @xcite by introducing ultraviolet cutoff and later the corresponding result was derived by zeta function technique milt99,gosd98,lamb99 .",
    "the local characteristics of the corresponding electromagnetic vacuum such as energy density and vacuum stresses are considered in @xcite for the interior and exterior regions of a conducting cylindrical shell , and in @xcite for the region between two coaxial shells ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "the exactly solvable problems with this type of boundaries are useful for testing the validity of various approximations used to deal with more complicated geometries . from this point of view",
    "the wedge with a coaxial cylindrical boundary is an interesting system , since the geometry is nontrivial and it includes two dynamical parameters , radius of the cylindrical shell and opening angle of the wedge .",
    "this geometry is also interesting from the point of view of general analysis for surface divergences in the expectation values of local physical observables for boundaries with discontinuities .",
    "the nonsmoothness of the boundary generates additional contributions to the heat kernel coefficients ( see , for instance , the discussion in apps98,dowk00,nest03 and references therein ) .",
    "the present paper is concerned with local analysis of the vacuum of the electromagnetic field constrained to satisfy perfectly conducting boundary conditions on boundary surfaces of a wedge with a coaxial cylindrical boundary .",
    "namely , we will study the vacuum expectation values of the field squares and the energy - momentum tensor for the electromagnetic field for both regions inside and outside the cylindrical shell .",
    "in addition to describing the physical structure of the quantum field at a given point , the energy - momentum tensor acts as the source of gravity in the einstein equations .",
    "it therefore plays an important role in modelling a self - consistent dynamics involving the gravitational field .",

    "the vacuum expectation values of the field square and the energy - momentum tensor in the geometry of a wedge with an arbitrary opening angle and with a cylindrical boundary are evaluated in @xcite .",
    "note that , unlike the case of conformally coupled fields , for a general coupling the vacuum energy - momentum tensor is angle - dependent and diverges on the wedge sides .",
    "our method here employs the mode summation and is based on a variant of the generalized abel - plana formula @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "this enables us to extract from the vacuum expectation values the parts due to a wedge without the cylindrical shell and to present the parts induced by the shell in terms of strongly convergent integrals .",
