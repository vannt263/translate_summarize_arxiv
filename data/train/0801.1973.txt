    "recently , it was shown by the author @xcite that asymptotic freedom appears at very short distances in the model of low - energy quantum gravity @xcite . in this case",
    ", the screened portion of gravitons tends to the fixed value of @xmath5 , that leads to the very small limit acceleration of the order of @xmath6 of any screened micro - particle .",
    "while asymptotic freedom of strong interactions @xcite is due to the anti - screening effect of gluons , the gravitational one is caused by the external character of graviton flux and the limited rise of the screened portion at ultra short distances . in this paper ,",
    "i consider how a transition occurs from the inverse square law to almost full asymptotic freedom .",
    "the most important property of this transition is its non - universality : for different particles it takes place in different distance ranges , and the order of these ranges is terribly far from the planck scale where one usually waits of manifestations of quantum gravity effects .",
    "= 9.0 cm    in the model of low - energy quantum gravity @xcite , the condition of big distances : @xmath7 should be accepted to have the newton law of gravitation .",
    "i use here the notations of @xcite : @xmath8 is the cross - section of interaction of graviton pairs with an average pair energy @xmath9 with a particle having an    = 9.0 cm    energy @xmath10 , @xmath1 is a distance between particles 1 and 2 . as it was shown in @xcite , the equivalence principle should be broken at distances @xmath11 when the condition ( 1 ) is violated for a proton - mass particle .",
    "the ratio @xmath12 describes the screened portion of gravitons for a big distance @xmath1 . for small @xmath1 ,",
    "let us consider fig .",
    "1 , where @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the screening area ( the square of the spherical segment of the hight @xmath15 ) , and @xmath16 is an angle for which @xmath17 .",
    "then we get for @xmath18 @xmath19 and it is necessary to replace the ratio ( 2 ) by the following one : @xmath20 i rewrite ( 2 ) as @xmath21 and i introduce the ratio of these functions : @xmath22 in fig .",
    "2 , the behavior of the functions @xmath23 is shown .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath24 by @xmath25 is equal to 1/2 ; namely this property of the function leads to asymptotic freedom @xcite .",
    "= 9.0 cm    in this model , the cross - section @xmath26 is equal to @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the temperature of the graviton background , @xmath29 , @xmath30 is a graviton energy , the new constant @xmath31 has the value : @xmath32 the quantity @xmath33 has been computed for the two cases ( see fig .",
    "3 ) : @xmath34 ( the left vertical axis on fig .",
    "3 ) and @xmath35 ( the right vertical axis on fig .",
    "3 ) , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are masses of a proton and of an electron , correspondingly .",
    "to find the net force of gravitation @xmath38 at a small distance @xmath1 , we should replace the factor @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( 31 ) of @xcite with the more exact factor @xmath40 .",
    "then we get : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is an energy of particle 1 , and @xmath43 is the function of @xmath1 : @xmath44 where @xmath45 . by @xmath46 , this function s    = 9.0 cm    limit for any @xmath10",
    "is : @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "because breaking the inverse square law is described with this new function , it will be convenient to introduce the function @xmath48 which differs from @xmath43 only with the replacement : @xmath49 .",
    "graphs of these two functions , @xmath43 and @xmath50 , are shown in fig . 4 for the case @xmath34 .",
    "for comparison , graphs of the function @xmath43 are shown in fig . 5 for    = 9.0 cm    the following different energies : @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the functions have the same limit by @xmath46 , but the most interesting thing is their different transition to this limit when @xmath1 decreases .",
    "= 9.0 cm    to underline this non - universal behavior , we can compute the ratio : @xmath51 which aims to unity by big @xmath1 .",
    "graphs of this function @xmath52 are shown in fig . 6 for the same energies : @xmath34 and @xmath35 . as we see in this picture , the range of transition for a proton is between @xmath53 meter , while for an electron it is between @xmath4 meter .",
    "so as @xmath54 , it is obvious that the functions @xmath55 and @xmath56 are universal for any energy @xmath10 of a micro - particle .",
    "this scaling law means , for example , that if deviations from the inverse square law begins for a proton at @xmath57 , then for a particle with an energy of @xmath58 , the same deviations appear at @xmath59 .",
    "the considered model has the two unexpected properties : asymptotic freedom and a non - universal transition to it . as distinct from qcd , at very small distances",
    "the attractive force of gravitation does nt decrease when @xmath46 , instead , it remains only finite and very small - but its limit value is the maximal possible one .",
    "perhaps , it would be better to say that gravity between micro - particles gets a saturation at short distances in this model .",
