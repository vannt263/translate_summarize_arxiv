    "two spheres , one inside the other , in differential rotation with a layer of fluid between will generate a broad array of possible dynamics in the enclosed fluid , depending on the aspect ratio , the rotation rates of the spheres , and the viscosity of the fluid .",
    "if the fluid is electrically conducting and permeated by a magnetic field , applied and/or self - excited , the array of possible dynamics broadens further .",
    "the configuration , known as magnetized spherical couette flow , was first studied numerically by hollerbach @xcite as an extension of the nonmagnetic spherical couette problem @xcite . since then",
    "the flow has been investigated , numerically @xcite and experimentally @xcite , under a variety of imposed fields and magnetic boundary conditions with sometimes surprising results .",
    "for example , in the case of a conducting inner boundary an applied magnetic field can induce a flow rotating faster than the inner sphere or rotating in the opposite direction to the inner sphere , depending on the applied field configuration @xcite .",
    "the superrotating case was experimentally demonstrated in the derviche tourneur sodium ( dts ) experiment @xcite .",
    "a compendium of magnetized spherical couette results can be found in @xcite .",

    "<S> this demonstrates a mechanism for the saturation of one mode and for the suppression of other unstable modes . </S>",
    "<S> a given mode grows by extracting energy from the axisymmetric flow , and then saturates as the energy transfer to its second harmonic equals this inflow . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> , this mode suppresses other unstable modes by facilitating an energy transfer to linearly stable modes . </S>"
