    "this paper reports multiband study of ngc 708 a radio loud elliptical galaxy selected from b2 @xmath2[3]}$ ] for which observational data in radio , nir , uv and x - ray band are already available through various data archives .",
    "the main goal of this multi wavelength study is to investigate possible inter - correlation among different constituents of ism and coexistence of multiphase ism in extra - galactic environment .",
    "this work adresses a wide variety of issues related to different physical properties of dust in early type galaxies . in particular",
    ", the data is used to ( 1 ) perform multi - band surface photometry and generate composite and multicolor profiles for the galaxies .",
    "( 2 ) use color profiles to study morphology of molecular gas , dust and other faint features .",
    "( 3 ) obtain dust properties from wavelength - dependent dust extinction and compare it with the properties of dust in the milky - way .",

    "the integrated exposure time in b , v , r and h@xmath0 bands were 3600s , 2700s , 1800s , 5400s respectively .",
