    "recently , mhd calculations including radiative effect are used to reveal the interaction between flux emergence and the convective motion near the surface @xcite .",
    "toroidal flux tubes are also considered as an initial condition to study the dynamics of flux emergence @xcite .",
    "the works introduced above can be divided into two groups : one is for the dynamics within the interior from @xmath5 to the surface , and the other for the emergence from the uppermost convection zone ( a few @xmath6 depth ) to the corona .",
    "an additional experiment is required on the evolution of the emerging flux tube from the deep convection layer to the corona through the surface for the further understanding of the flux emergence in a self - consistent manner @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we perform a two - dimensional compressible mhd study on the buoyant twisted magnetic flux tube initially embedded deep in the convection zone ( @xmath7 ) , of which the depth is the same as our previous study ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) and is ten times deeper than most of previous calculations considering the emergence from the uppermost convection zone .    in paper",
    "i , we carried out numerical experiments on the emerging flux sheet , which decelerates in the convection zone and extends horizontally beneath the surface .",
    "when the magnetic flux accumulates near the surface due to the successive emergence below , the flux sheet is subject to the parker instability and thus further evolution to the corona occurs ( the `` two - step emergence '' model ) . when the field is too weak , the rising flux can not evolve further to the corona and remains within the solar interior ( `` failed emergence '' ) , while , in the case of a strong field , the flux directly emerges to the upper atmosphere without showing a deceleration ( `` direct emergence '' ) .",
    "the results of the present study are similar to the previous experiments . in the convection zone ,",
    "the cross - sectional evolution of the flux tube is similar to the papers by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we found that , as the flux tube rises , aerodynamic drag becomes more effective , since the external flow from the apex forms a wake behind the main tube .",
    "also , the emergence above the surface is similar to the calculations by @xcite .",
    "however , there is an important difference from those papers ; the deceleration of the rising tube occurs when the tube is far below the photosphere , and the tube makes a flattened @xmath8-shaped structure widely beneath the surface . by conducting an analytic model which includes the effect of the mass pile - up , we confirm that the tube s deceleration is the consequence of the fluid accumulation between the rising tube and the photosphere .",
    "the magnetic flux stretched horizontally beneath the surface becomes magnetic buoyancy - unstable locally so that the second - step emergence to the corona takes place .",
    "these features resemble the previous two - step model in paper i. we also carry out parameter surveys to study the dependence on the initial twist and the field strength .    in the next section (  [ sec : model ] ) , we give a description of the model used in this study , while the results of the numerical experiments are shown in detail in section [ sec : results ] . in section [ sec : param ] , we present the results of the parameter study .",

    "the evolution within the interior resembles the studies by @xcite and @xcite , and the evolution to the upper atmosphere is similar to @xcite .",

    "figure [ fig : ro ] displays the evolution of the density profile ( color contour ) in a vertical plane normal to the tube axis , while the solid lines and arrows indicate the magnetic field lines and the velocity vectors , respectively . figure [ fig : ro](a ) presents the initial state ; the flux tube is located at @xmath86 with a circular shape , and begins to emerge because of the buoyancy due to its smaller density relative to the surroundings .",

    "thus , the tube moves up with a constant acceleration rate . in the next phase ( @xmath88 )",
    ", the aerodynamic drag grows to counteract buoyancy , since the external flow around the tube s cross - section develops a wake behind the main tube ( figure [ fig : ro](c ) ) , and the acceleration of the rise velocity is reduced .",
    "the azimuthal field of the flux tube resists this deformation and prevents the tube from fragmenting into a counter - rotating vortex pair ( the so - called `` umbrella shape '' in @xcite ) . during the emergence in the convection zone",
    ", the rise velocity of the tube center fluctuates due to the internal torsional oscillation ( figure [ fig : vz_3 ] ; see  [ sec : conv ] ) . as the flux tube reaches close to the photosphere",
    ", it expands horizontally ( figure [ fig : ro](e ) ) and its rise speed decreases after @xmath89 .",
    "eventually , the subsurface flux extends widely in the range of @xmath90 at @xmath91 ( figure [ fig : ro](f ) ) . when the top of the subphotospheric flux becomes unstable to the magnetic buoyancy instability , further evolution to the corona breaks out ( figures [ fig : ro](f)-(i ) ; see  [ sec : corona ] ) .",
    "the consequent coronal loop at the time @xmath92 has its width @xmath93 and height @xmath94 .",
    "the picture of this evolution resembles our previous `` two - step emergence '' model ( paper i ) . in the following sections",
    ", we will describe some more detailed results , especially on the magnetic and the flow field within the convection zone , the comparison with the analytic model , and the second - step evolution starting at the photosphere .",
    "to study the flux tube s emergence in the solar interior , we show the variation of the field configuration with time in figure [ fig : mag ] .",
    "the color contour indicates the distribution of the longitudinal field ( @xmath95 ) while the strength of the azimuthal field ( @xmath96 ) is overplotted with solid lines . in figure",
    "[ fig : vor ] , we plot the @xmath23-component of the vorticity vector @xmath97 , where @xmath98 and white and black colors indicate positive ( counter - clockwise ) and negative vorticity ( clockwise ) , respectively .",
    "these figures ( figures [ fig : mag ] and [ fig : vor ] ) look similar to those of previous experiments within the convection zone @xcite .",
    "figures [ fig : mag](a ) and [ fig : vor](a ) present the initial state : the flux tube has a circular shape and there is no vorticity within the domain . as the tube begins to emerge , the field strength reduces and the tube expands , since the background density decreases with height ( figures [ fig : mag](b)-(d ) ) . also , the external flow from the apex to the flanks of the tube creates negative and positive vortex sheets in the right and left side of the main tube , respectively ( figures [ fig : vor](b)-(d ) ) .",
    "therefore , the tube is deformed and the wake behind the main tube grows with a pair of counter - rotating vortex rolls . because of the azimuthal fields , however , the tube is not entirely fragmented into an `` umbrella shape . ''",
    "as a consequence , the rising tube feels aerodynamic drag , and , thus , the rise velocity levels off at this time .",
    "the longitudinal field component keeps its strength in the core of the vortex rolls as well as in the main tube ( see figure [ fig : mag](e ) ) . behind the main tube , in @xmath99 in figure [ fig : mag](f ) , there is a weakly magnetized tail with non - zero vorticity ( figure [ fig : vor](f ) ) .    during this phase ,",
    "the rise speed of the tube center reveals oscillation as seen in figure [ fig : vz_3 ] .",
    "this is a result of torsional oscillation due to the differential buoyancy caused by the magnetic field distribution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "initially , the flux tube has its maximum field strength at the center and thus the central region rises faster than the periphery .",
    "therefore , the azimuthal field around the apex is compressed and strengthened to fortify the magnetic tension force , which inhibits the tube from a distortion into vortex rolls .",
    "the tension force decelerates the center of the tube and , as a result , induces the internal torsional oscillation .",
    "the period of this oscillation is observed to be consistent with the time of the azimuthal alfv@xmath100n speed traveling across the tube s diameter .    at around @xmath89 ,",
    "the rise motion begins to decelerate and the front of the tube expands horizontally , since the tube is close enough to the surface .",
    "the plasma above the rising tube can not move through the isothermal ( i.e. , convectively stable ) photosphere so that the fluid is compressed and piles up between the front of the tube and the photosphere .",
    "the fluid between them suppresses the rising motion of the flux below , and thus , the flux extends sideways . the horizontal expansion caused by the photosphere",
    "was previously reported by @xcite .",
    "his flux tube was not so deformed as to develop a wake including vortex rolls and directly entered the photosphere mostly keeping its original cylindrical shape , because the initial tube was located just beneath the surface ( @xmath101 ) with a strong field strength ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "in our case , the initial tube was embedded so deep in the convection zone ( @xmath103 ) that the wake behind the main tube was formed and the drag force became more effective .",
    "the velocity shear between the horizontal flow above the tube and the photosphere forms vortex sheets at around @xmath104 ( figure [ fig : vor](e ) ; the positive sheet in the right half , and the negative in the left ) .",
    "finally , at @xmath105 , the flux tube has a @xmath8-shaped structure and the magnetic field extends widely beneath the surface ( figure [ fig : mag](f ) ) . the vortex sheet at the tube front collides against the subphotospheric sheet ( figure [ fig : vor](f ) ) . in this stage ,",
    "the azimuthal field beneath the surface is much stronger than the longitudinal field because of the radial expansion of the flux tube @xcite .",
    "@xcite compared their numerical results of the emerging twisted flux tube obtained by 2.5d anelastic mhd experiments with those of the thin - flux - tube model . according to @xcite ,",

    ", the torsional oscillation due to the differential buoyancy is seen in figure [ fig : vz_tft ] , which was mentioned in  [ sec : conv ] .",
    "after @xmath89 , the rising flux tube decelerates as the mass on the tube is compressed and piles up , since the mass can not persist through the convectively stable surface .",
    "this deceleration indicates that , before @xmath89 , the cross - sectional evolution as a whole can be regarded as radial , although the tube suffers aerodynamic deformation ; after that time , however , the mass pile - up becomes much more efficient so that the tube decelerates and the apex expands horizontally to become @xmath8-shaped ( see the solid and the dotted line in figure [ fig : vz_tft ] ) .    figure [ fig : dro](a ) shows the density accumulation @xmath139/\\rho_{0}$ ] , where @xmath140 is the initial background density profile ( see equation ( [ eq : pre ] ) ) , and the field lines with velocity vectors at the time @xmath141 .",

    "thus , when the tube reaches the surface , the apex of the tube can not hold sufficient flux for the further evolution , which leads to `` failed emergence . ''",
    "the situation can also be explained as follows ; when the initial twist is weak , the flux tube expands and extends very widely beneath the surface .",
    "thus , the magnetic buoyancy falls short of compressing the flux to satisfy the criterion ( [ eq : newcomb ] ) for the second - step emergence . in figure [ fig : further2 ] , we show the distribution near the surface for the case @xmath187 at the time @xmath188 . figure [ fig : surface2 ] plots the magnetic pressure , the gas pressure , and the density along the symmetric axis @xmath148 .",
    "the subsurface magnetic field is not fortified enough so that the magnetic pressure is much smaller than the plasma pressure .",
    "therefore , the index @xmath162 ( see  [ sec : corona ] ) is not negative in almost the whole area shown in figure [ fig : newcomb2 ] , which means that the further evolution to the solar corona due to the magnetic buoyancy instability does not take place in this weaker twist case .",
    "figure [ fig : btube ] shows the height - time relations for the cases with @xmath189 , @xmath190 , and @xmath191 , which are indicated with dashed , solid , and dash - dotted lines .",
    "we can conclude from this figure that the rise speed is faster with the stronger field . as is the case with the dependence on the twist , we can say that , if the initial field is too weak , the rise speed is slower and the flux tube can not pass through the surface to rise further into the corona .",
    "the general tendency of the parametric studies varying the tube s twist and the strength is consistent with previous two- and three - dimensional experiments @xcite .",
    "the numerical experiments studied in this paper are on the cross - sectional evolution of the emerging twisted flux tube . in this section ,",
    "we summarize the calculations presented above and discuss the results .",
    "the discussions are mainly in connection with paper i. we can predict the conditions for three - dimensional experiments by considering the results of the present and previous two - dimensional studies .",
    "so , in this section , we discuss the two - dimensional results in connection with our future three - dimensional experiments .    in this paper",
    ", we have studied the dynamical evolution of the twisted flux tube that emerged from the deep convection zone . for the typical case ,",
    "the initial flux tube is located at @xmath52 with the axial field strength @xmath63 , the tube radius @xmath62 , and the total magnetic flux @xmath192 .",
    "the tube is initially buoyant and , thus , begins to rise through the convection zone .",
    "halfway to the surface , after @xmath193 , the periphery of the tube is peeled away to develop a wake , composed of vortex rolls and a long - drawn tail , due to the external flow from the apex to the flanks . as a result ,",
    "the aerodynamic drag becomes more effective .",
    "however , the azimuthal field prevents the flux tube from being fragmented into a pair of counter - rotating vortices moving away from each other , so that the expansion as a whole can be said to be radial .",
    "the picture of the emergence within the convective layer is similar to previous papers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the essential difference from these preceding studies is the effect of the convectively stable photosphere ; the apex of the tube expanding horizontally and the rising motion turning into the deceleration after @xmath194 , because the rising tube comes close to the photosphere .",
    "the deceleration occurs at ten times deeper than previously reported by @xcite ; the deceleration depth is @xmath195 in magara s case , while it is @xmath196 in our case , which shows that the flux tube slows down before the tube itself reaches the surface .",
    "there seems to be another mechanism for the slowdown other than the tube itself entering the photosphere .",
    "the plasma on the flux tube piles up between the flux and the convectively stable surface , and depresses the flux below .",
    "we confirmed this effect by comparing the numerical result with an extended analytic model ( see section [ sec : analytic ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath8-shaped emerging flux extends widely beneath the surface ( @xmath197 in width ) . in this stage ,",
    "the azimuthal field component is dominant , since the twist of the flux tube increases as the tube rises .",
    "when the horizontal flux at the photosphere becomes unstable to the magnetic buoyancy instability at @xmath198 , the second - step emergence to the corona takes place ( `` two - step emergence '' ) .",
    "the evolution above the surface is similar to that of @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear evolution is well described by the expansion law given by @xcite .",
    "the consequent coronal loop at @xmath199 has its width @xmath93 and height @xmath94 , and the photospheric field is @xmath200 .    by performing parameter studies",
    ", we found that the initial twist necessary for the further evolution is @xmath201 when the axial field @xmath202 g. if @xmath58 is less than this value , the emerging tube remains within the convection zone ( `` failed emergence '' ) .",
    "we also found that the flux with a weaker field strength shows the failed emergence .",
    "when the tube twist is @xmath203 , the flux with @xmath204 g can not rise further above the surface .    in paper",
    "i , we carried out numerical experiments on the two - dimensional undular evolution of the flux sheet from the deep convection zone ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "we found that the emerging flux sheet also decelerates in the convection zone .",
    "however , deceleration depth is deeper than that of the present study .",
    "table [ tab : discuss ] summarizes the characteristic values of both types of emergence .",
    "as seen from table [ tab : discuss ] , the initial conditions ( the field strength , the total magnetic flux , the sheet thickness and the tube radius , and the depth ) are similar to each other , while the obtained values concerning the evolutions in the convection zone ( the arrival time at the photosphere and the deceleration depth ) are different .",
    "that is , the twisted flux tube rises faster than the flux sheet and the deceleration occurs at a higher altitude .",
    "the difference between the two cases comes from the geometry of the emerging fluxes , i.e. , a sheet or a tube .",
    "the plasma on the emerging flux tube can flow around the tube s cross - section so that the tube rises faster .",
    "the fluid on the flux sheet , however , drains only along the magnetic field lines to both troughs , so that the plasma suppresses and slows down the rising sheet below halfway to the surface . as for the twisted flux tube ,",
    "the deceleration occurs in the later phase when the tube itself approaches the surface and begins to expand horizontally ( see  [ sec : conv ] and  [ sec : analytic ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that , in the initial state , the flux sheet is in hydrostatic equilibrium while the flux tube is in mechanically non - equilibrium .",
    "in addition , the mass draining along the longitudinal field line is not considered in the present tube calculation .",
    "three - dimensional experiments are required to investigate these effects .    by conducting the parameter survey",
    ", we found that the emerging flux tube can not rise further if the initial twist is too weak ( `` failed '' case ) , because the weak azimuthal field can not hold the tube s coherency and thus can not hold the field intensity necessary for the second - step emergence .",
    "such a flux remains below the surface and floats around the solar interior .",
    "the condition for the `` two - step emerging '' flux tube that yields a realistic active region at the surface is @xmath205 with @xmath206 at @xmath52 . in paper",
    "i , it was also found that there is a threshold of the flux sheet strength and the total flux for further emergence .",
    "that is to say , the emerging flux with a weak twist also shows `` failed emergence '' as well as the flux with a weak field strength and an insufficient total flux . if we put these results obtained from the two experiments together , the preferable initial conditions for the three - dimensional calculation using the twisted flux tube from the same depth ( @xmath7 ) are the field strength @xmath165 a few @xmath207 , the total magnetic flux of @xmath208 , and sufficient twist ( @xmath201 ) . in future three - dimensional simulations",
    ", we will take into account the above mentioned conditions .",
    "the comparison with the results by thin - flux - tube experiments ( see  [ sec : intro ] ) has been discussed in paper i. in figure 10 of paper i , the typical case of the present calculation ( case 1 with @xmath209 and @xmath210 ) locates in the middle of the area for the two - step emergence . @xcite found that the magnetic flux tube with weaker field `` explodes '' within the interior and never reaches the surface ; when the pressure gap between inside and outside the initial flux tube is too small , i.e. , when the initial magnetic field is too weak , the tube will be collapsed at a certain height , since the pressure gap decreases . in paper",
    "i , we found that the cases showing two - step emergence would have survived the `` explosion '' during their ascents through the interior .",
    "therefore , we can see that the typical tube ( the present case 1 ) also would have emerged through the convection zone without suffering explosion .",
    "numerical computations were carried out on nec sx-9 at the center for computational astrophysics , cfca , of the national astronomical observatory of japan , and on m system ( fujitsu fx1 ) and v system ( nec sx-9 ) of jaxa supercomputer system .",
