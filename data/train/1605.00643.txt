    "understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies is one of the most fascinating problems in modern cosmology .",
    "the observed galaxy luminosity and hi - mass functions have much shallower faint - end slopes than predicted by @xmath2cdm models ; this is locally known as the ` missing satellites problem ' of the milky way , which should contain many more dwarf - sized subhalos than observed ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "recent cosmological simulations have identified feedback in the form of galactic winds as being primarily responsible for solving this problem as well as for obtaining realistic rotation curves of disk galaxies and for enriching the intergalactic medium with metals @xcite . however , galactic winds in these simulations are often included as a phenomenological model .",
    "their basic properties , such as the wind velocity or mass loading , are tuned to match observed global relations of galaxies .",
    "ideally , we would like to directly simulate the physics responsible for the wind driving , but the exact nature of this physical origin is still strongly debated .",
    "one popular idea is that momentum - driven winds could result from radiation pressure acting on dust grains and atomic lines in dense gas , imparting enough momentum to accelerate the gas , potentially explaining strong outflows in starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , direct radiation - hydrodynamics simulations of the rayleigh - taylor instability @xcite and large - scale galaxy models @xcite fail to see strong , mass - loaded winds because the radiation is not sufficiently trapped ( as assumed in more simplified analytical calculations ) but instead generates a channel structure along which a substantial fraction of the radiation is able to escape .",
    "crs in galaxies have also been proposed to drive outflows in a number of theoretical works @xcite or by using three - dimensional simulations of the ism @xcite .",
    "polarized radio observations of edge - on galaxies show poloidal field lines at the disk - halo interface ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this argues for a dynamical mechanism that is responsible for reorienting the toroidal magnetic field in the disk and may be explained by a cr - driven parker instability @xcite .",
    "indeed , recent hydrodynamical simulations of the formation and evolution of disk galaxies have shown that cr pressure can drive strong bipolar outflows in disk galaxies provided they are allowed to stream @xcite or diffuse @xcite relative to the rest frame of the gas .",
    "however , they also showed that injecting crs at supernova remnants and only accounting for their advective transport is not sufficient for launching winds @xcite .",
    "most of these simulations treated cr transport in the isotropic approximation , even though it is clear that crs are dominantly transported along magnetic field lines @xcite . here , we present high resolution simulations of the formation and evolution of a disk galaxy in an isolated @xmath0 dark matter halo with isotropic as well as anisotropic diffusion and analyze the differences .",
    "we describe our methods and setup in  [",
    "sec : methods ] .",
    "we then discuss differences in the properties of the gas disk and the outflow in ",
    "[ sec : disk ] .",
    "we analyze the magnetic field amplification in the disk for the different runs in  [ sec : bfield ] and end with a brief summary in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we simulate the formation and evolution of an isolated disk galaxy in a @xmath0 halo with the moving - mesh code arepo @xcite .",
    "we use the new second order hydro scheme @xcite .",
    "cooling and star formation are modelled as described in @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields are modelled with ideal mhd using cell - centered magnetic fields and the powell scheme @xcite for divergence control @xcite .",
    "crs are modelled as a relativistic fluid with a constant adiabatic index of @xmath3 in the two fluid approximation @xcite . and @xmath4 .",
    "] to model the generation of crs in supernova remnants from core - collapse supernovae , we inject @xmath5 erg of cr energy per solar mass of formed stars into the local environment of every newly created star particle .",
    "in contrast to similar work @xcite , we describe the thermal and kinetic energy injection with an effective equation of state @xcite .",
    "we model cr cooling to thermal energy and radiation via coulomb and hadronic interactions assuming an equilibrium distribution @xcite .",
    "moreover , in addition to advection of the cosmic ray fluid with the gas we include active cr transport relative to the gas rest frame in the form of isotropic or anisotropic diffusion @xcite . for isotropic diffusion ,",
    "we assume a constant isotropic diffusion coefficient of @xmath6 . for anisotropic diffusion ,",
    "we employ the same constant value parallel to the magnetic field and no diffusion perpendicular to it .",
    "our setup is very similar to the isolated disk setup described in @xcite .",
    "we model the dark matter halo as a static nfw @xcite density profile with a concentration parameter of @xmath7 . in this dark matter",
    "halo we put slowly rotating gas in hydrostatic equilibrium with a baryonic mass fraction of @xmath8 and add rotation with a spin parameter of @xmath9 .",
    "the magnetic field is initialized as a uniform homogeneous seed field along the @xmath10-axis with an initial field strength of @xmath11 .",
    "there are no crs in the initial setup .",
    "we start with about @xmath12 gas cells with a target mass of @xmath13 , the same as the typical mass of a star particle . using explicit refinement and de - refinement",
    "we enforce that the mass of all cells is within a factor of two of the target mass .",
    "moreover , we require that adjacent cells differ by less than a factor of @xmath14 in volume , otherwise the larger cell is also refined .",
    "we employ the standard mesh regularization scheme in arepo @xcite . in the following",
    ", we discuss @xmath15 simulations with crs that differ by either employing transport with isotropic diffusion , by using anisotropic diffusion , or by not including transport at all .",
    "otherwise the simulations are identical .",
    "initially in all of our simulations , the gas sphere immediately begins to cool , with the fastest cooling rates occurring at the dense center .",
    "the gas loses pressure support and collapses into a disk as it keeps its specific angular momentum .",
    "once the gas density in the disk becomes high enough , stars are formed and crs are injected for every star particle formed . due to the resulting inhomogeneous cosmic ray distribution , the transport of crs becomes important .",
    "the star formation rate for all runs peaks around @xmath16  myr and then declines quickly , with most stars being formed in the first gyr ( see figure  [ fig : energies ] ) . as the first stars form , the cr energy density in the disk quickly increases and is about @xmath14 times as large as the thermal energy density when it peaks around @xmath16  myr .",
    "later it declines again , mostly owing to cooling processes .",
    "for our runs the star formation rate decreases with increasingly efficient diffusion .",
    "this effect is caused by crs diffusing away from the center of the disk where most stars are formed .",
    "they reduce the flow of gas to the center as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : energies ] .",
    "this is different to @xcite who found that diffusion increases the star formation rate .",
    "the discrepancy is likely a consequence of the different setup , as @xcite simulate the evolution of an existing disk which leads to much more distributed star formation .",
    "figure  [ fig : diskslice ] shows the disk after @xmath17  gyr for the runs with isotropic and anisotropic diffusion . at this time , the gas densities in the disks are very similar in both runs .",
    "they strongly peak in the center of the disks , where most of the stars are formed and thus most of the crs are injected . for the run with isotropic diffusion , they are then transported away in all directions and become quickly diluted into an almost spherical distribution .",
    "in contrast , with anisotropic diffusion , crs can only be transported along magnetic field lines and therefore the diffusion process is very sensitive to the structure of the magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic field strength is initially ( in the first @xmath16  myr ) amplified exponentially on very small timescales to a field strength of about @xmath18 ( see top right panel in figure  [ fig : energies ] ) , consistent with a turbulent small - scale dynamo .",
    "after this initial phase the disk has formed and the differential rotation in the disk dominates the velocity field .",
    "the magnetic field continues to grow exponentially , but on much longer timescales , indicating that the dominant amplification mechanism has changed . around that time",
    ", the structure of the magnetic field also changes from a chaotic small - scale field to one completely dominated by its azimuthal component ( see right panel in figure [ fig : diskslice ] ) .",
    "note that even though the magnetic field is essentially completely aligned with the velocity field , it features a large number of field reversals , a behavior that is clearly different to our previous results for more massive halos @xcite .",
    "we will explore this interesting dependence of the magnetic field structure on halo mass in a separate publication .",
    "for the simulation with anisotropic diffusion , this magnetic field structure means that within the first @xmath16  myrs , the crs diffuse essentially isotropically , but with a significantly lower effective diffusion coefficient as they are not transported along straight lines on large scales .",
    "afterwards , however , they are mostly trapped at their radial and vertical positions and are only carried along the angular coordinate .",
    "thus , a much larger fraction of the injected crs remains in the disk as compared to the run with isotropic diffusion . also , the run with anisotropic diffusion is more similar to the simulation without any diffusion in terms of the overall population of crs in the disk .",
    "perhaps the strongest indication of a difference in the dynamic state of the gas in the disk for the different types of diffusion can be seen in the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "after @xmath17  gyrs , the typical magnetic field strength in the anisotropic diffusion run is about @xmath19 .",
    "in contrast , in the isotropic diffusion run it only reaches a field strength of order @xmath20 by this time .",
    "since the structure of the magnetic field is very similar in both runs , it appears that either the same amplification mechanism works with different efficiencies in the two runs , or that different amplification mechanisms dominate in the two runs .    even though the total energy in crs in the disk is very similar for the runs with anisotropic diffusion and without diffusion , the effect of the crs is rather different with respect to outflows .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : wind ] , both simulations with diffusion develop strong centralized bipolar outflows , comparable to previous simulations of isolated disks with isotropic diffusion @xcite . the wind is driven by the vertical cr pressure gradient in the outer layers of the disk . at early times",
    "@xmath21  myr , its effect is very similar for both diffusion runs ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : energies ] ) .",
    "later , the magnetic field becomes dominated by its azimuthal component , and vertical cr diffusion is suppressed by a factor of @xmath22 for the anisotropic diffusion run .",
    "its outflow fully develops after 800 myr ; by contrast , only 400 myr are needed in the isotropic diffusion run .",
    "after @xmath17  gyr , the outflows have mass loading factors of @xmath23 ( measured at a height of @xmath24  kpc above and below the disk and within a radius of @xmath14  kpc ) and @xmath25 in the runs with anisotropic diffusion and isotropic diffusion , respectively , broadly consistent with previous results for milky way like massive halos @xcite .",
    "the run without diffusion does not develop any large scale outflows .",
    "instead , it shows a strong fountain flow up to a height of @xmath26-@xmath15  kpc .",
    "this fountain flow is also present in the diffusion runs , but is suppressed in the simulation with isotropic diffusion . in this calculation , the vertical velocity field in the disk ( excluding the bipolar outflow ) seems to be generally lower and lacks small - scale structure . note that in both diffusion runs we additionally see what looks like a large - scale fountain flow over the disk , outside the central outflow , that reaches beyond @xmath14  kpc in height .",
    "as discussed above , the amplification timescales of the magnetic field strength deviate after an initial period of small - scale turbulent amplification in the two runs with isotropic and anisotropic diffusion . at the same time , the azimuthal component of the magnetic field starts to dominate over the vertical and radial components in all runs , even though initially all three components of the magnetic field were of equal strength .",
    "this indicates a change in the dominant amplification mechanism from small - scale turbulent amplification to a large - scale dynamo .",
    "an analytical model to describe magnetic field amplification in an axisymmetric disk has been proposed by @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the mean radial field @xmath27 and mean azimuthal field @xmath28 in cylindrical coordinates change as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the mean vertical velocity in the disk , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the radial and azimuthal components of the turbulent electric field , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 parameterize the angular velocity as @xmath35 . here",
    ", we already neglected additional terms containing ohmic diffusion , as assumed by ideal mhd in our simulations .",
    "the angular velocity shown in figure  [ fig : rprof ] can be well described by a power law that it is very similar for all runs .",
    "therefore , it can not explain the differences in the observed amplification timescales of the magnetic field .",
    "note that the magnetic field strength already differs by a factor of two at @xmath16  myrs between the runs with isotropic and anisotropic diffusion .    to estimate the importance of the remaining terms in the galactic dynamo equations above",
    ", we show the vertical profiles of the total magnetic field strength , mean vertical velocity , and @xmath36 and @xmath37 in figure  [ fig : zprof ] . at @xmath16  myrs , when the magnetic field strength starts to diverge , the vertical velocities close to the disk are still very similar in all three runs .",
    "however , the gradients in the strength of the radial and vertical magnetic field are shallower for the isotropic diffusion run as some highly magnetized gas has been pushed vertically out of the disk .",
    "therefore , the amplification terms are smallest for the run with isotropic diffusion .",
    "the largest amplification terms are present for the run without diffusion .",
    "it also has the strongest gradients in the magnetic field strength as there is no significantly magnetized material above a height of @xmath26  kpc .",
    "the situation is very similar after @xmath17  gyrs .",
    "now the magnetic field strength has mostly saturated for the runs without diffusion and with anisotropic diffusion , as the magnetic energy has become comparable to the kinetic energy in the vertical component of the velocity field .",
    "the still ongoing amplification is sufficient to compensate losses by numerical diffusion of the magnetic field and by the transport of magnetized gas out of the disk . in the run with isotropic diffusion",
    "the magnetic field strength is one order of magnitude smaller .",
    "it still increases slowly , but steadily , until its energy approaches the vertical kinetic energy after about @xmath14  gyrs .",
    "note that even though the galactic dynamo model seems to do a good job in explaining the amplification of the magnetic field strength in our simulations as well as the qualitative differences between the runs , it is important to point out that its applicability is not obvious , as the large - scale magnetic field has many local field reversals that make the definition and interpretation of a mean magnetic field difficult .",
    "we also note that we do not model ohmic diffusion , therefore all magnetic diffusion is due to numerical dissipation effects on the grid scale .",
    "in this work , we focussed on the impact of different cr transport processes in simulations of isolated disk galaxies . for clarity",
    ", we studied the same initial conditions with isotropic diffusion and with anisotropic diffusion based on our newly developed solver .",
    "in addition , we also applied to this set - up a model that does not explicitly account for diffusion processes .",
    "our simulation outcomes with isotropic diffusion are consistent with previous results .",
    "however , we find that with anisotropic diffusion , crs are initially mostly confined to the disk due to the predominantly azimuthal magnetic field , such that they end up being distributed similarly to the run without any diffusion .",
    "moreover , we find that there are significant secondary differences in the disk gas dynamics between the runs with isotropic diffusion and anisotropic diffusion .",
    "in particular , the isotropic diffusion run strongly suppresses the magnetic field amplification and needs almost a hubble time until the magnetic field strength saturates . in comparison , in the simulations with anisotropic diffusion and without diffusion",
    ", the field already saturates after around @xmath38  gyr .    given these differences ,",
    "we conclude that it is important to model the full anisotropic nature of cr transport , because the isotropic approximation can produce qualitatively and quantitatively incorrect results .",
    "it also seems likely that a similar conclusion holds for the more general case of cr streaming .",
    "this process has been included in simulations of galaxy formation for the first time by @xcite , but in an isotropic fashion .",
    "very recently , @xcite presented the first attempt of an anisotropic treatment .",
    "as our results confirm , this is clearly a very interesting research direction for future work on galaxy formation and evolution .",
