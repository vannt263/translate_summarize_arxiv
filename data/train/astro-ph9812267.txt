    "in a study of the kinematics and abundances of the outer regions of the galactic bulge ibata , gilmore & irwin ( 1994 , 1995 ) discovered a group of stars with heliocentric radial velocity around 140 kms@xmath3 and a low velocity dispersion , which could not be accounted for by any model of the galactic bulge .",
    "the finding was readily interpreted as a dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( dsph ) which is a satellite of our own galaxy . at a distance of about 25",
    "kpc sagittarius is the nearest external galaxy .",
    "it is undergoing tidal disruption and is probably in the process of merging with the galaxy .",
    "this could in fact be one of the many merger events which have contributed to shape the present day galaxy .",
    "the colour - magnitude diagram of sagittarius suggests a spread in metallicity , which may result from different bursts of star formation .",
    "we have analyzed low resolution spectra ntt+emmi / mos to obtain radial velocities and crude estimates of abundances .",
    "the method we have developed is quite powerful but the low s / n obtainable with ntt on these v@xmath4 stars does not allow any firm conclusion on the chemical history of sagittarius .",
    "the observations described here were taken at eso la silla on june 19th 1996 with the ntt telescope and emmi in multi - object - spectroscopy ( mos ) mode .",
    "we used grism # 5 , which provides a resolving power of about @xmath5 .",
    "the range covered varies slightly depending on the position of the star relative to the center of the field , but the range 480 - 550 nm was available for all the stars .",
    "the spectra are not useful towards shorter wavelengths due to the falling stellar flux and the decreased efficiency of the ccd .",
    "the log of observations is given in table 1 .",
    "details on the observed field can be found in marconi et al ( 1998 ) .",

    "the spectra were calibrated in wavelength using a he - ar lamp spectrum and zero - point shifts were determined from atmospheric emission lines . to measure radial velocities we used cross - correlation technique in the 480 - 530 nm range . as templates we used synthetic spectra of appropriate temperature and [ fe / h]@xmath7 computed with the synthe code ( kurucz 1993 ) .",
    "we selected as likely sgr members all the stars with @xmath8 ( ibata et al 1997 ) .",
    "this left us with a sample of 23 stars out of 57 observed .",
    "the velocity dispersion of these stars is 23 kms@xmath3 .",
    "since the internal velocity dispersion of sagittarius is only 10 kms@xmath3 ( ibata et al 1995 ) , we assume the dispersion to be dominated by the measurement error of which it may be taken as a somewhat conservative estimate .",
    "the radial velocities are given in table 2 , the stars are identified by their number in the marconi et al ( 1998 ) paper .",
    "for each star we determined the effective temperature from the @xmath9 colour of marconi et al ( 1998 ) and the calibration of alonso et al ( 1996 ) .",
    "although the calibration is only valid for dwarfs , @xmath10 depends little on gravity ; based on theoretical colours computed by castelli ( 1998 ) we expect to make an error less than 100 k , negligible in this context .",
    "gravities were determined from the isochrones of straniero , chieffi & limongi ( 1997 ) of 8 gyr and [ fe / h]@xmath7 .",
    "we developed an iterative procedure for the estimate of abundances .",
    "for each star we started from a guess of the metallicity and computed a synthetic spectrum .",
    "then both the observed and computed spectra were pseudo - normalized using the same pseudo - continuum windows , the observed spectrum was then normalized by multiplying it by the ratio normalized / pseudo - normalized obtained for the synthetic spectrum . on this normalized spectrum",
    "we measured four line indices , two of which measure the mgb triplet ( m1 and m2 ) and four which measure features due to iron - peak elements ( f1,f2,f3,f4 ) .",
    "placement of the indices is illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "the indices were defined so as to work efficiently on the sun .",
    "then for each index we iteratively computed its value on the synthetic spectrum , changing the input abundance until it matched the measured index .",
    "we first iterated only on the f ( iron - peak ) indices at each iteration scaling all of the abundances of the input model .",
    "next we took as scaling the median of the four f indices and keeping this value fixed we iterated on the m indices changing only the mg abundance .",
    "next we computed a new synthetic spectrum using this scaling and mg abundance and re - normalized the observed spectrum on this new synthetic spectrum and iterated the whole procedure until the change in metallicity was less than 0.2 dex .",
    "typically three iterations were enough to meet this criterion .",
    "the procedure is quite cpu intensive and each iteration takes about three hours on the dec alpha of the oat .",
    "the effectiveness of the procedure was tested on the solar spectrum using both the kurucz et al ( 1984 ) solar atlas , degraded at the resolution of our grism spectra and twilight spectra .",
    "we were able to reproduce the solar ( fe / h ) and ( mg / fe ) to within 0.1 dex .",
    "the values determined from the solar atlas for each index were used as zero point , so as to make our analysis strictly differential with respect to the sun .",
    "three matters are of main concern in assessing the results obtained in this way : 1 ) the reliability of the line list we are using .",
    "the good results obtained for the sun do not grant the completeness and correctness of the list , since our program stars are about 1000 k cooler and of much lower gravity .",
    "we shall try to quantify this issue in the future by analyzing the spectrum of a cool giant ; 2 ) the placement of the continuum .",
    "the emmi slitlets have ragged edges which do not allow a flux calibration , this , in conjunction with the low s / n of our spectra may induce an error in the continuum which is difficult to asses ; 3 ) the microturbulent velocity has to be assumed , the results presented here are obtained for @xmath11 .",
    "clearly at this resolution we have no handle on microturbulence what we shall do in a forthcoming paper is to quantify the effect of microturbulence on abundances .",
    "while these factors may affect our analysis in a systematic way ( i.e. we may have a zero point uncertainty in the derived metallicities ) they will not affect the relative abundances of the analyzed stars since the effective temperatures and gravities are quite similar .",

    "the results for eight of the 23 candidate members of sgr are presented in table 2 .",
    "two facts stand out : 1 ) we do not find any star as metal  poor as [ fe / h]@xmath30 , as was suggested by the photometry ; 2 ) three out of eight stars are metal  rich .",
    "our metallicity scale may still suffer from a zero - point uncertainty which could make the most metal  poor stars we observe close to @xmath31 , it is however interesting to note that a mismatch between photometric and spectroscopic metallicities in the same sense as the one we have here has been found by francois et al ( 1997 ) for the young halo globular cluster ruprecht 106 .",
    "investigation of abundances of the whole available sample might allow to establish if we are in the presence of some systematic effect in abundance determinations or if what we see is merely a selection effect .",
    "the presence of the metal - rich stars is disturbing , although they may in fact just be bulge interlopers , three out of eight seems a rather high percentage .",
    "furthermore the metal  rich stars do not show sign of alpha  element enhancement as that displayed by the bulge k giants analyzed by mcwilliam & rich ( 1994 ) , but are more like the smr stars in the solar neighbourhood",
    ". an independent investigation of metallicities of sgr giants has been carried out by smecker - hane , mcwilliam & ibata ( 1998 ) based on high - resolution spectra obtained at the keck telescope , their results indicate a metallicity @xmath32 for the metal  poor stars , lower than our lowest metallicity stars , however two out of seven stars they have analyzed are metal  rich and alpha  elements o and ca are underabundant with respect to solar , in keeping with our results .    probably the best way to decide whether these metal - rich stars belong to the bulge or to sagittarius is to determine the proper motions of the stars in their field .",
    "bulge stars should show larger proper motions while sagittarius stars should show a small and coherent proper motion .",
    "such an investigation is within the capabilities of a diffraction limited instrument , such as hst , over a time baseline of just few years . at the distance of 8.5 kpc a star with a transverse motion of 100 kms@xmath3",
    "would show a proper motion of 2.48 mas / yr .    the future for abundance determinations for sagittarius lies in the use of 8 m class telescopes .",
    "the 8.2 m vlt with the fors1 instrument will allow to obtain spectra of these stars with s / n @xmath33 , albeit with a slightly lower resolution .",
    "moreover the slitlets of fors1 in multi - object mode are sharp and will allow flux calibration of the spectra .",
    "our technique of abundance estimation applied to such spectra should then be capable of producing abundances accurate to the 0.3 dex level .",
    "we wish thank f. castelli for providing the theoretical colours and constant support in using the model  atmosphere and spectrum synthesis codes and a. chieffi for providing the isochrones used in this work .",
