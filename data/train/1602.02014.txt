    "thiol self - assembled monolayers ( sams ) on metal surfaces are ubiquitous systems due to their easy adaptability in many different applications ranging from bio - sensors to electronics.@xcite the utility of these systems is that by designing / using an appropriate thiol molecule , the properties of the metal surfaces can be altered in a controlled way .",
    "the properties of thiol sams are governed by the balance between the intermolecular and molecule - surface interactions and have been the subject of intense experimental@xcite and computational@xcite studies . by playing with the chemical nature of the thiol molecules",
    "this balance can be altered and sams with different structural , interface and/or surface properties could be obtained .",
    "one very important property , especially for electronic applications , is the work function of the metal surface coated with the sam which can be controlled by tuning the dipole moment of the molecules forming the sam.@xcite to alter the work function either single component sams made up of thiol molecules with appropriate dipole moment or mixed sams made up of two different thiol molecules each with a different dipole moment can be employed.@xcite in both cases , most of the time , the dipole moment of the molecules are tuned by adding a functional group to the backbone or to the end of the molecules .",
    "this approach however not only changes the dipole moment but also alters the geometry of the molecule which in turn may result in sams with different structural properties which is coupled to the electronic properties of the film / surface . to be able to study the effect of geometry and the chemical / electronic nature of the molecule on the properties of the film independently , hence ,",
    "it is necessary to decouple these two changes in the molecule .",
    "dicarbacloso - dodecaborane thiols ( c@xmath0b@xmath1h@xmath2s , will be referred to as carboranethiols ) is an outstanding alternative to this end , since by playing with the positions of the carbon and sulfur atoms , the electronic properties of the molecule ( i.e. dipole moment ) can be altered without changing geometry .",
    "this fact combined with their chemical stability and almost spherical shape make cts unique molecules for studying the fundamental properties of thiol sams and for preparing films that can be used in many different applications .",
    "hence , sams of cts and their derivatives have attracted increasing interest in recent years.@xcite    recently , lbben and coworkers have demonstrated that by using pure and mixed sams of two carborane dithiol isomers [ 1,2-(hs@xmath0)-1,2-c@xmath0b@xmath1h@xmath1 and 9,12-(hs@xmath0)-1,2-c@xmath0b@xmath1h@xmath1 ] with opposite dipole moments , the surface potential of silver surfaces could be tuned .",
    "weiss et al . , on the other hand , used two ct isomers [ 1-hs-1,7-c@xmath0b@xmath1h@xmath7 ( m1 ) and 9-hs-1,7-c@xmath0b@xmath1h@xmath7 ( m9 ) , see figure 1 for naming of ct isomers ] and were able to tune the gold work function over a range of 0.8 ev by preparing mixed sams of these two isomers in different ratios.@xcite then , they used such sam coated gold surfaces as electrodes of organic field effect transistors and observed an improvement in the device characteristics .",
    "in addition they found that m1 adsorbs on the au(111 ) surface stronger than m9 , based on contact angle and reflection absorption ir spectroscopy results , and attributed this to dipole - dipole interactions of the molecules in the sam . in case of m1 the dipole moment vector of",
    "the molecule is parallel to the gold surface ( see figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] ) whereas for m9 the direction is perpendicular to the surface .",
    "hence weiss _ et al .",
    "_ proposed that the head - to - tail orientation of the dipoles of the m1 molecules could yield a more favorable adsorption when compared with m9 .",
    "in addition , very recently they showed that dipole - dipole interactions to be highly defect tolerant based on stm measurements@xcite which can be interpreted as another outcome of the importance of the dipole - dipole interactions on determining thiol film structure and adsorption strength .",
    "finally , based on scanning tunneling microscope images , they suggested two possible unit cell [ ( 5 @xmath3 5 ) and ( @xmath8)r23.4@xmath9 structures for m1 and m9 sams which are depicted in figure  [ fig3].@xcite    inspired by these experimental results we set out to perform a computational study to investigate the relation between the dipole moments of the molecules and their binding strengths and monolayer electronic and crystal structures . to this end",
    "we have calculated the dipole moments of all possible ct isomers shown in figure  [ fig1 ] by using density functional theory .",
    "then we have modeled isolated molecules on au(111 ) surface and determined the binding energies .",
    "finally for the isomers m1 and m9 we have performed calculations for different full monolayer structures and determined the preferred crystal structure and the effect of the crystal structure on the electronic properties of the interface .    , width=313 ]",
    "in order to describe the atomic and electronic structures of isolated and full monolayer adsorption of carboranethiols on the flat gold surface , periodic boundary density functional theory ( dft ) calculations were carried out based on the projector augmented - wave ( paw)@xcite method as implemented in vasp.@xcite single particle valence states were expanded in terms of plane waves up to a kinetic energy cutoff of 400 ev .",
    "the electron - electron exchange and correlation interactions have been included using both the standard perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) functional within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) and the dispersion corrected optb86b - vdw functional@xcite within the van der waals density functional ( vdw - df ) approach.@xcite the vdw correction mimics the attractive electronic interactions beyond the equilibrium separations .",
    "therefore , the basic idea is to include the long range part of the correlation energy as a fully nonlocal functional of the charge density .    before moving on to the surface properties , we tested pbe and optb86b - vdw ( exchange - correlation ) xc functionals against the lattice parameter of the bulk gold ( fcc ) .",
    "the standard pbe gives a value of 4.160  .",
    "the vdw correction leads to 4.125  which better compares with the experimental value of 4.078 .@xcite we modeled the flat gold surface as a four atomic layer slab in a supercell which also contains a vacuum region with a height of 21  along the surface normal .",
    "this vacuum separation reduces to 14  after ct molecule adsorption on the surface .",
    "initial coordinates of gold atoms were taken from their bulk positions .",
    "then , we performed a full optimization of the ionic coordinates and lattice translation vectors based on the variational minimization of the hellmann - feynman forces by requiring each spatial component to be less than 0.01 ev /  on each atom .",
    "the average nearest neighbor au - au bonds were found as 2.917  with and as 2.942  without the dispersive corrections .",
    "the standard xc functionals tend to overestimate the bond lengths especially in metallic systems .",
    "this is basically due to the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "it tries to parametrize the xc energy as a functional of the electron density from the uniform distribution of an homogeneous electron gas with the same charge density .    for calculations involving molecular adsorbates on the surface ,",
    "the gold atoms at the bottom two layers were frozen to their fully relaxed positions .",
    "the ( @xmath10 ) surface unit cell is considered for the adsorption of an isolated ct on au(111 ) .",
    "this supercell is large enough to put at least 9.9  separation between the periodic images of the ct adsorbates on the surface .    in the full monolayer ct coverage on flat gold ,",
    "we considered the ( @xmath10 ) and ( @xmath4)r23.4@xmath5 structures as a probable surface phases as suggested by recent experiments.@xcite the surface brillouin zone integrations were carried out over @xmath11-point samplings with @xmath12-centered 5@xmath35@xmath31 meshes .",

    "we have calculated the total and projected densities of states ( dos ) of au(111 ) with m9 and m1 at low and full coverages using the vdw - df theory calculations .",

    "the homo - lumo separation of m9(m1 ) is found to be 4.4(4.7 ) ev . due mostly to dipole - dipole interactions within the ct layers , the energy levels , in both cases , get slightly dispersed without showing a significant shift in their positions .",

    "this result is also consistent with our calculated adsorption energies in table  [ table3 ] .",
    "although the dipole - dipole interactions are weak in sams , the inclusion of vdw correction terms in the description of electronic structures of organic - metal interfaces becomes important .",
    "we carried out periodic density functional theory calculations by considering isolated and full adlayer of carboranethiol isomers on the au(111 ) surface . in order to quantitatively show the effect of the long - range correlations on both the final geometries of ct - metal composite systems and their electronic structures",
    ", we included dispersive forces in a self - consistent implementation of the vdw - df method .",
    "then comparisons were made with the results obtained using the standard exchange - correlation functional .",
    "isolated carboranethiols prefer the hollow site for dissociative adsorption on the gold ( 111 ) surface by forming strong au - s bonds .",
    "pbe calculations indicate that m4 has the lowest total energy among the other isomers in the gas phase .",
    "m1 has a dipole moment almost parallel to the surface while m9 has a moment nominally along the surface normal .",
    "their 1 ml results indicate the role of the moment orientation on the relative total supercell energies of sams .",
    "the total energy of au(111 ) with a full monolayer of m9 is always lower that that of m1 with both the pbe and the optb86b - vdw functionals . on the other hand , m1 is more preferable than m9 in terms of stability since it always gives relatively stronger binding in both isolated and monolayer structures due to more favorable dipole - dipole interactions in sams .",
    "the lda tends to underestimate the adsorption energies because of improper description of the long - range correlations .",
    "pbe calculations favor a ( 5@xmath35 ) film phase between the two competing surface structures since the dissociative adsorption energy per ct appears to be positive on ( @xmath35)r23.4@xmath5 structure .",
    "the inclusion of vdw interactions correct the average adsorption energy per ct of the latter phase to be slightly negative .",
