    "[ structures]b ) and @xmath50 for fhua ( @xmath0 at the left corner of fig .",
    "[ structures]c ) , elicit special attention .",
    "the value of @xmath51 , especially for large sized rna arises from their characteristic chain organization : similar to tads in chromosomes , proximal sequences along the chain are stabilized by base pairing to form independently stable modular  contact domains \" , consisting of hairpin , bulges , and loops .",
    "further assemblies among these contact domains are achieved by a number of tertiary interactions ( base triples , kissing loops , coaxial stackings through ribose zipper , a - minor motif , and metal - ion interactions ) @xcite .",
    "the abundance of distal contacts resulting from the hierarchical chain assembly likely contributes to the greater frequency of the long - range contacts , giving rise to @xmath4 for 23s rrna on the scale of @xmath52 ( see the next section ) .",
    "the distinct chain organizations of rna and proteins become more evident when molecules are visualized using rainbow coloring scheme spanning the chain ( figs.[structures]b and [ structures]c ) .",

    "in stark contrast to rrna , typical proteins with @xmath53 ( indexed with black labels from 1 to 5 in figs.[structures]a and [ structures]c ) retain chain conformations whose subchains look topologically more intermingled with the rest of the structure , lacking visually distinct domains of a similar color .",
    "the intermingled chain configurations of native proteins as well as the contact probability scaling exponent @xmath53 points to a configuration of equilibrium globule , which is also supported by the same conclusion reached by investigating the loop size distribution of native protein structures @xcite . of particular note are the proteins with @xmath54 , which are found at the outliers of @xmath45 .",
    "for example , @xmath55 is for chrondroitin sulfate abc lyase i ( the protein indexed with 6 ) @xcite , the chain configuration of which has clearly demarcated contact domains .    instead of calculating the @xmath1-dependent contact probability for individual molecules ( @xmath35 , @xmath56 )",

    "cautionary remarks are in place in regard to the power - law scaling of @xmath0 .",
    "the characteristic power - law decay behavior of 23s rrna with @xmath61 is only valid for intermediate range of @xmath1 . for small @xmath1",

    "in the strict sense the chain organizations of both rna and proteins are _ not _ scale - invariant , which is not the case for any real polymer , either .",

    "of note , the new scaling exponent @xmath65 recently discovered for chromatin organization at resolution ( @xmath66 mb ) @xcite higher than the previous study ( @xmath67 kb ) @xcite implies that the self - similarity found at the intermediate resolution ( @xmath14 ) can not be extended to the internal structure of contact domain with @xmath68 .",

    "[ contacts]a ) and fhua ( @xmath50 ) ( fig .",
    "[ contacts]b ) reveal that 23s rrna has a greater density of long - range contacts than fhua .",
    "interestingly , in 23s rrna the modular contact domains made of sequences , spanning @xmath69 ( magenta ) and @xmath70 ( orange ) or between @xmath69 ( magenta ) and @xmath71 ( cyan ) , form extensive interfaces ( fig . [ contacts]a ) . in comparison",

    "it is of note that the analyses presented in figs . 3 , 4 , 5 are different from investigating each macromolecule one by one ( fig . 1 ) and finding the structure - function relationship .",
    "given that the ensemble in question is the product of evolution , clarifying the difference between two classes of macromolecules ( rna and proteins ) is promising as soon as the evolutionary questions are concerned .",
    "due to intramolecular forces stabilizing chain molecule , both native rna and protein molecules retain compact and space - filling structures , satisfying @xmath128 @xcite , which from the polymer physics perspective is regarded as the property of polymers in poor solvent conditions .",
    "it is , however , critical to note that the size of a _ subchain _ surrounded by other subchains should scale as @xmath129 , which is indeed confirmed for the proteins with @xmath10 ( fig.s5 ) .",
    "according to the  flory theorem \" @xcite , a test chain in a _ fully _ equilibrated homogeneous semi - dilute or concentrated polymer melt @xcite , in spherical confinement @xcite , or even in globule is expected to obey the gaussian statistics because of the screening of excluded volume interaction or counterbalance between attraction and repulsion @xcite , thus satisfying @xmath129 or @xmath13 ( see supporting material ) .",
    "the distinct contact probability exponent is highlighted by our analysis that @xmath130 for large rna and @xmath131 for small rna or globular proteins over the intermediate range of @xmath132 .",
    "evident from rrna structure ( fig .",
    "[ structures ] ) , subchains of rna at scales @xmath133 are assembled into modular contact domains , which are better demarcated in the form of stem - loop helices than proteins , and stitched together through long - range tertiary contacts ( fig .",
    "[ contacts]a ) .",
    "the evidence of this characteristic architecture of rna with multi - modular domains is visualized vividly in the form of multiple rupture events in single molecule pulling experiments of _ t_. ribozymes @xcite , while many proteins display a cooperative and effectively all - or - none unfolding under force @xcite .    what causes the crumpled structures of large rna at the scale of @xmath132 ?",
    "here , the statistical rarity of knots in native rna @xcite , which is unparalleled by proteins or dna @xcite , is worth noting . in general , knots are unavoidable when a long polymer chain ( @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the entanglement length @xcite ) is folded to an equilibrium globule @xcite .",
    "topological knot - free constraints inherent to the ring polymers , however , have been shown to organize melts of unconcatenated polymer rings or a single long polymer ring into crumpled globules , preventing entanglements @xcite . since large rna molecules , assembled by a number of secondary structural elements ( hairpin loops , stems ) , resemble a collection of small and large rings , it can be surmised during the folding process , the knot - free constraints are effectively imposed .",
    "the knot - free constraints are more likely applied for rna because the energy scale associated with secondary structure elements ( @xmath136 ) , is in general well separated from that of tertiary interactions ( @xmath137 ) , such that @xmath138 @xcite , which makes secondary structure elements _",
    "independently stable_. by contrast , in order to fold , proteins undergo reptation - like process , after the initial collapse @xcite , which may take place with ease because secondary structure elements of proteins ( @xmath17-helix , @xmath18-sheet ) are only marginally stable relative to the thermal energy . if necessary",
    ", these motifs can be reassembled into thermodynamically more stable structures .",
    "while local and remote contacts are mixed in the folding nuclei of proteins , the formation of secondary structures in rna folding usually precedes the formation of tertiary contacts , so that the folding of rna is hierarchical @xcite .",
    "folding under kinetic control produces thermodynamically metastable and kinetically trapped intermediates , which occurs ubiquitously in rna folding @xcite , especially in cotranscriptional folding of rna @xcite .",
    "a decision , made at an early stage of folding , involved with the formation of independently stable secondary structure elements is difficult to revert although in a worst case scenario , cofactors such as metal - ions @xcite , metabolites @xcite , and rna chaperones @xcite still can induce a secondary structure rearrangement .",
    "hence , a more proper way to understand conformational dynamics of a large rna molecule with @xmath48 is to consider an ensemble of multiple functional states @xcite instead of a thermodynamically driven , unique native state .",
    "it is noteworthy that rna secondary structure prediction algorithms which use the strategy of searching the minimum free energy structure @xcite fail to predict the correct secondary structure when @xmath48 , and require the comparative sequence analysis or experimental constraints @xcite .",
    "this could be ascribed to the consequence of error accumulated in predicting rna structures with large @xmath19 , but it is also suspected that the ( free ) energy minimization principle can not be extended to account for the folding process of large rna .",
    "the contact statistics of large rna , @xmath139 , can be used as an additional constraint or guideline for structure prediction .",
    "a situation analogous to the hierarchical folding of large rna is prevalent in the two - stage membrane protein folding where the insertion of transmembrane ( tm ) @xmath17-helices , guided by translocons , is followed by the post - insertion folding @xcite .",
    "we indeed find that the contact probabilities of class a g - protein coupled receptors ( gpcrs ) give @xmath12 ( blue circles in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ structures ] ) .",
    "since @xmath12 means the chain organization of native gpcrs is not in entropy - maximum state , a thermodynamically guided , spontaneous _ in vitro _ refolding of gpcrs into the native form is expected to be non - permissible .",
    "an afm experiment on an @xmath17-helical membrane protein , antiporter ( @xmath140 ) , whose @xmath9 value we find is @xmath141 , could not be refolded to the original form after mechanically unfolded @xcite .",
    "however , a recent remarkable single molecule force experiment @xcite has shown that glpg , an @xmath17-membrane proteins with @xmath142 , can reversibly fold in bicelles even after the entire structure including tm helices is disrupted by mechanical forces .",
    "remarkably , we find @xmath53 for glpg . for membrane proteins of known native structures , their @xmath9 values can be used to judge whether or not spontaneous _ in vitro _",
    "refolding is possible .",
    "since the time required for equilibrium sampling of conformations ( @xmath143 ) increases exponentially with the system size ( @xmath19 ) as @xmath144 @xcite , signatures of metastability or non - equilibration in chain conformation could be ubiquitous in a macromolecular structure with large @xmath19 . through the statistical analysis of structures in pdb ,",
    "our study puts forward that the present forms of crumpled chain organization with @xmath12 of large native rna and some classes of proteins are an ineluctable outcome of the folding mechanism under kinetic control .",
    "our results , based on the structures available in pdb , might be fraught with a possible sample bias since the current structural information available in pdb is limited underrepresenting intrinsically disordered proteins or membrane proteins for proteins , and long non - coding intron rna ( lncrna ) abundant in the cell for rna @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , our general conclusions on the difference in the organization principle between proteins and rna will still hold even when the database of pdb is further expanded .",
    "especially , we expect that an inclusion of long non - coding rna structures ( @xmath145 ) , which should be possible in the near future , will make our conclusions more robust since the hierarchical nature of rna folding process would become more evident for rna with larger @xmath19 and reinforce the territorial ( crumpled - like ) organization in rna .",

    "<S> proteins are in general more compact , globular , and flexible than rna @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such differences may be originated from distinct nature of building block . </S>",
    "<S> the energy scale of binary interaction that pairs nucleotides is typically greater than that of amino acids . </S>",
