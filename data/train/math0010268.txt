    "using the axiom of choice , felix hausdorff proved in 1914 that there exists a partition of the sphere into four parts , @xmath0 , such that @xmath1 has lebesgue measure @xmath2 , the sets @xmath3 are pairwise congruent and @xmath4 is congruent to @xmath5 ( _ cf._@xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "this theorem later became known as hausdorff s paradox .",
    "if we want to avoid this paradox , we only have to reject the axiom of choice .",
    "but if we do so , we will run into other paradoxical situations .",
    "for example , without the aid of any form of infinite choice we can not prove that a partition of a given set @xmath6 has at most as many parts as @xmath6 has elements .",
    "moreover , it is consistent with set theory that the real line can be partitioned into a family of cardinality strictly bigger than the cardinality of the real numbers ( see fact[fct : partition ] ) .",
    "set theory without the axiom of choice has a long tradition and a lot of work was done by the warsaw school between 1918 and 1940 .",
    "although , in 1938 , kurt gdel proved in @xcite the consistency of the axiom of choice with the other axioms of set theory , it is still interesting to investigate which results remain unprovable without using the axiom of choice ( _ cf._@xcite ) .    in 1963 , paul cohen proved with his famous and sophisticated forcing technique , that it is also consistent with the other axioms of set theory that the axiom of choice fails ( _ cf._@xcite ) . also with a forcing construction",
    ", thomas  jech and antonn  sochor could show in @xcite that one can embed the permutation models ( these are models of set theory with atoms ) into well - founded models of set theory .",
    "so , to prove consistency results in set theory , it is enough to build a suitable permutation model .",
    "we will investigate the relationships between some infinite cardinal numbers .",
    "for four cardinal numbers  which are related to an arbitrary given one  we will give all the possible relationships between two of them ; where possible means that there exists a model of set theory in which the relationship holds .",
    "for example it is possible that there exists an infinite set @xmath6 such that the cardinality of the set of all finite sequences of @xmath6 is strictly smaller than the cardinality of the set of all finite subsets of @xmath6 . on the other hand ,",
    "it is also possible that there exists an infinite set @xmath7 such that the cardinality of the set of all finite sequences of @xmath7 is strictly bigger than the cardinality of the power - set of @xmath7 . in a few specific permutation models , like the basic fraenkel model and the ordered mostowski model",

    "the set @xmath26 is called the * cardinality * of @xmath6 and a set @xmath27 is called a * cardinal number * ( or simply a * cardinal * ) if it is the cardinality of some set .",
    "note that a cardinal number is defined as a set .",
    "a cardinal number @xmath26 is an * aleph * if it contains a well - ordered set .",
    "so , the cardinality of each ordinal is an aleph .",
    "remember that the axiom of choice is equivalent to the statement that each set can be well - ordered .",
    "hence , in zfc ( this is zermelo - fraenkel s set theory with the axiom of choice ) , every cardinal is an aleph ; and vice versa , if every cardinal is an aleph , then the axiom of choice holds .",
    "if we have a model @xmath10 of zf in which the axiom of choice fails , then we have more cardinals in @xmath10 than in a model @xmath28 of zfc .",
    "this is because all the ordinals are in @xmath10 and , hence , the alephs as well .",

    "notice , that for infinite cardinals @xmath40 and @xmath41 , we must use the axiom of choice to prove that @xmath54 implies @xmath45 ( see _ e.g._@xcite ) .",
    "in general , if we work in zf , there are many relations between cardinals which do not exist if we assume the axiom of choice ( _ cf._@xcite ) ; and non - trivial relations between cardinals become trivial with the axiom of choice ( see also @xcite or @xcite ) .",
