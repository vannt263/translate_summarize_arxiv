    "one of the best `` smoking - gun '' signals for establishing the existence of an annihilating or decaying dark matter ( dm ) particle is the possible observation of a cosmic @xmath0-ray line @xcite .",
    "forthcoming satellites @xcite and air cherenkov telescopes @xcite , but also current instruments like the fermi large area telescope @xcite and the hess instrument @xcite , will allow to probe this possibility with further sensitivity . from dm particle annihilations the amount of monochromatic @xmath0-rays produced",
    "is expected to be limited ( even if in some cases it can saturate the present observational bounds ) because it is in general loop suppressed with respect to the total annihilation cross section , that is generically constrained by the dm relic density . for a decay , on the contrary",
    ", the amount of monochromatic rays emitted could a _ priori _ be much larger . even if in many scenarios the dm particle is not expected to decay at all , there exists a well - motivated theoretical framework where dm would naturally decay with a lifetime larger than the age of the universe : if its stability is due to an accidental low energy symmetry that has no reason to be respected by any ultraviolet ( uv ) theory , just as expected for the proton in the standard model ( sm ) . in this case",
    "the effect of the uv physics causing the decay is suppressed by powers of the uv scale . at low energy , this can be parametrized in full generality by writing down the most general effective theory respecting the low energy symmetries of the model . for a dm particle mass around the electroweak scale ( as supported by thermal scenarios ) , it turns out that a decay suppressed by 4 powers of the grand unified theory ( gut ) scale , _",
    "i.e. _ induced by dimension 6 operators , leads to a lifetime which can give fluxes of cosmic rays ( crs ) of the order of current observational sensitivities @xcite .",
    "this is a too nice opportunity to probe the gut scale to not study it in more detail .",
    "for an explicit example of a setup with an accidental symmetry , which can lead to dm decay into @xmath0-lines through dimension 6 operators , see reference @xcite .",
    "the use of an effective theory picture for a dm decay is fully justified because , unlike an annihilation , it necessarily requires a large uv scale ( unless one would invoke extremely tiny coefficients ) . as explained below",
    ", this model - independent gauge invariant effective operator approach implies that when a dm particle decays , it does so to several final states .",
    "it is therefore different from the usual model independent approach of considering indirect detection constraints on separated single decay final states , as e.g.  refs .",
    "the amount of crs that these several final states induce is also in general larger than those from electroweak corrections on a @xmath0-line final state , as considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . by allowing a systematic determination of the @xmath0-ray line emission possibilities , and by properly taking care of the low energy symmetries of the theory , the low energy",
    "effective operator language is the appropriate one to approach a series of important related questions : what are the theoretical expectations to see a @xmath0-line from a dm decay ( including , what effective structure a uv theory must induce to do so ) ?",
    "what are the possibilities to see a @xmath0-line , given the cr constraints , and conversely to see crs associated to the observation of a @xmath0-line ? and from there , what are the possibilities to discriminate among the various effective radiative operators , hence to have information on the dm particle whose decay would have produced the @xmath0-line , and maybe on the uv physics associated ?",
    "to write down the most general effective theory of dm decays is a quite tremendous task , especially if one allows for new particles into which the dm particle could decay . in scenarios of accidentally stable dm ,",
    "such particles can be expected , see e.g.  ref .",
    "however , for the production of monochromatic lines it turns out that this can be done , _",
    "i.e. _  the number of operators ( up to dimension 6 ) is quite limited .",
    "this is due to the stringent criteria an operator must fulfill in this case :    1 .   first",
    ", obviously the operator must contain the dm field .",
    "2 .   secondly , in order for the operator to lead to a two - body decay with a photon , it must not contain too many fields ( except eventually scalars that could be replaced by their vacuum expectation values ( vev ) ) and it must contain either a hypercharge @xmath1 or a @xmath2 @xmath3 field strength . if the dm particle is neutral , as we will assume here , the photon can not come from a covariant derivative because in the two body decays all fields are necessarily neutral .",
    "one could eventually have a photon emitted from an operator that contains a new @xmath4 gauge field that kinematically mix with the hypercharge gauge boson , @xmath5 ( rendering the various neutral particles to be effectively milli - charged ) .",
    "we will not consider this possibility here .",
    "it gives a range of bounds on the emission of @xmath0-ray lines which is similar to the one obtained below ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "thirdly , some operators can be related to other ones through various relations , equations of motions , shift of a derivative or use of the fact that the commutator of two covariant derivatives @xmath6 , @xmath7 gives @xmath8 .",
    "however one must be careful in using these relations .",
    "the criteria we apply here is that through these relations an operator can be dropped from the list only if in this way there is a one - to - one correspondence between this operator and another one already in the list .",
    "otherwise both operators must be kept because in general they give different ratios of @xmath0-line to crs .    applying the criteria above",

    "let us start by discussing a simple way to , in principle , distinguish between some operators in the above list : from the different number of @xmath0-lines they can give and the relative strength and energy of these @xmath0-lines .",
    "[ fig : operator ] shows all types of two - body final states including @xmath0-lines that eqs .",

    "the operators giving more than one @xmath0-line can be separated into two categories , depending on if they include one or two sm field strengths .    on the one hand",
    "all the operators with two sm field strengths in the operator give peaks associated to the @xmath37 and @xmath38 channels .",

    "only one @xmath0-line will appear when the detector resolution and sensitivity are not good enough to separate too close monochromatic lines .",

    "of course , a dm particle can always give multiple lines by appearing in several operators involving fields with different masses .",
    "in the previous section we have seen how multiple @xmath0 lines might allow to single out some operators .",
    "we will now focus on a feature shared by all operators in our list , which will allow us to characterize them further : all allowed operators that give a decay into a @xmath0-ray line will unavoidably also produce , with different amounts , decays into particles producing crs .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that gauge symmetries dictate the possible effective operator structures .",
    "it is particularly clear that , if kinematically allowed , a @xmath64 boson is always among the final states since the hypercharge and @xmath2 neutral gauge eigenstates are made of a mixture of a photon and a z boson .- line(s ) is induced by effective operators @xcite or induced at one loop in explicit models @xcite .",
    "this property is also characteristic of specific gravitino decay scenarios @xcite . ]",
    "this multiple final state property is the crucial one why , by merely studying the corresponding continuum of crs at lower energies , we can put upper bounds on the possible strength of the @xmath0-line signal for any given operator . in the following",

    "i.e. _ @xmath44 is sufficiently large so that channels with up to two sm gauge bosons are kinematically fully open .",
    "we will also make the assumption that the mass of any new beyond sm final state particle is negligible with respect to the dm particle , so that if the operator leads to several peaks , they all show up at the same @xmath66 and their contributions are summed .",
    ", some channels could be more phase space suppressed than others , modifying the constraints .",
    "note also that , if one decreases @xmath44 towards the @xmath45 threshold , the @xmath67 ratio could go to zero or to infinity , depending on whether the operator induces a decay to @xmath37 . ]",
    "inspection of the full list of operators shows that there is no single operator which can give a ratio of monochromatic photons to @xmath64 production larger than ( what we call prediction a ) @xmath68 where @xmath69 stands for any cr which could be produced out of the @xmath64 , with @xmath70 the number of crs produced per @xmath64 boson at a given energy .",

    "given the fact that cr fluxes are observationally bounded from above , this ratio sets the absolute upper bound on the intensity of @xmath0-ray lines that a single operator can give , to be determined below .",
    "it is out of the scope of this work to list all the exact predictions the various operators give for the monochromatic photons to cr emission ( and the corresponding upper bound they give , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) because a single operator may give different ratios depending on the quantum numbers of the particles it contains , and the nature of the @xmath22 or @xmath21 particles they might involve .",
    "however the @xmath23 labels we have put beside each operator in eqs .",
    "( [ ophidm5yy])-([ov3dml ] ) allow already to see rather well what is going on for each of them .",
    "varying between all possible multiplets in the operators , each operator turns out to give a _ maximum _ ratio which is given either by a above or by one of the four following relations @xmath72 with @xmath73 for d and e , respectively .",
    "signal ratio a is characteristic of operators containing only @xmath1 , b is typical of those containing both @xmath1 and @xmath3 , and signal ratios c to e correspond to operators including only @xmath3 .",
    "these bounds are obtained assuming that the @xmath22 and @xmath21 particles which may show up in the two - body final state do not produce any crs ( as could be the case for a beyond sm particle ) .    from these maximal ratios",
    ", each operator may give a @xmath67 ratio that can be smaller in three possible ways , if the extra @xmath22 or @xmath21 particle does decay to crs ( in these cases we put a `` x '' index label ) , if the operator gives different ratios for different multiplets ( `` m '' label ) , or if the @xmath67 depends on the ( unknown ) vev of a scalar field ( `` v '' label ) .",
    "there are also operators which give a totally fixed ratio . in these cases",
    "we do not attach any index label .",
    "this is the case for two a type operators and for all @xmath74 cases .",
    "the `` @xmath75 '' and `` @xmath76 '' variations of @xmath67 that can arise for an operator are relatively limited .",
    "given the fact that in each case there is already production of crs from the @xmath64 ( and sometimes @xmath77 ) boson , if we assume the extra particles `` x '' give an amount of cr similar to what a @xmath64 or a @xmath77 boson produces , these particles can not modify largely the ratio .",
    "typically , the change is not more than a factor of a few or at most , in rare cases of type a predictions , around one order of magnitude .",
    "similarly , among the different multiplet configurations that do lead to a @xmath0-line , a given operator can have the @xmath67 ratio varying by a factor of a few up to at most a factor @xmath78 ( except for eq .",
    "( [ opsi1dml ] ) which allows a factor @xmath79 variation because it involves two fields on top of the dm and gauge boson fields ) .",
    "for example many operators of class c with an index `` @xmath76 '' may easily give , for some multiplets , @xmath80 bosons in the final state , in that case the signal ratios can give predictions equal or close to @xmath81 or @xmath82 .",
    "therefore from these effects it is not possible to go far below the maximum signal ratio , a - e , that each operator are assigned . only by varying the value of the vev of a beyond sm scalar field",
    "can we go far below the operators maximal @xmath67 ratio value , which is only possible for the two `` v '' labelled operators in eqs .",
    "( [ ophidmy])-([ophidml ] ) .",
    "the latter possibility stems from the fact that the @xmath83 production is proportional to @xmath84 whereas the @xmath0-line productions are instead proportional to the vev of @xmath22 , and thus disappear when the vev goes to zero.)-([ov3dml ] ) there is also a vev dependence but it is much milder . ]    as examples of `` v '' specific cases which necessarily give ratios much smaller than the a - e predictions , let us consider @xmath22 being a triplet of hypercharge 2 in the operators of eq .",
    "( [ ophidmy ] ) and ( [ ophidml ] ) .",

    "the @xmath0-line production is proportional to @xmath87 , whereas the @xmath88 production is proportional to @xmath84 . since the vev of a triplet",
    "is constrained to be small by electroweak data ( @xmath89  gev ) , the @xmath67 is suppressed by at least a factor @xmath90 . as a result , for example the @xmath91 case of eq .",
    "( [ ophidml ] ) lies a factor @xmath92 below the absolute one of case a for the @xmath67 ratio ( and with a @xmath0-line intensity so weak that basically it can not be distinguished from the associated continuum of @xmath0 rays , see below ) .",
    "this shows that operators that give `` v '' labelled predictions crucially depend on the electroweak quantum numbers of the particles involved and for some multiplets predict very weak lines . as stated above the same operators of eq .",
    "( [ ophidmy ] ) and eq .",

    "once the ratio between the predicted line signal and the lower energy energy continuum of cr is known , observational constraints on crs put indirect limits on the possible strength of any associated @xmath0-line signals . in fig .",

    "for the med and max propagation models ( defined in @xcite ) the various a - f curves in this figure would be approximately suppressed by a factor of 4 and 10 , respectively . as fig .",

    "put in another way , taking into account these possible future experimental improvements , the following picture emerges . on the one hand , for the operators that involve the @xmath1 field strength , a and b cases , and if they have no `` m '' or `` x '' or `` v '' possibility of suppressions , it appears clearly improbable that in a near future we could see a cr excess associated to a @xmath0 line . for a cases with index `` m '' and/or `` x ''",
    "this is not impossible , but difficult . for the a case with `` v '' label , it is possible to see both associated signals easily , even without invoking any `` m '' or `` x '' suppressions ( as in the f@xmath85 example ) . on the other hand for the operators that have a @xmath105 field strengths , c - e cases ,",
    "the discussion is the same but with all upper bounds shifted downward , so that it is easier to see both associated signals .",
    "we now focus our analysis on the special case where all particles beside the dm one would be sm fields .",
    "this turns out to be a possibility for all operators ( with @xmath21 replaced by the @xmath106 , @xmath107 or @xmath108 doublet and the scalar @xmath22 fields replaced by the sm scalar doublet @xmath109 or its conjugate ) , with the exception of eqs .",
    "( [ ovdm5y ] ) , ( [ ovdm5l ] ) , ( [ ophidmyy ] ) , ( [ ophidmly ] ) and ( [ ov1dmy ] ) . note that there is no dimension 5 operator of this type for vector dm particles , and for operators of dimension up to 6 the scalar dm particles can only have the quantum numbers ( 1/3/5,0 ) , ( 2/4/6,1 ) , ( 4/6,3 ) or ( 6,5 ) .",
    "for fermion dm particles only the ( 1/3/5,0 ) , ( 3/5,2 ) or ( 2/4,1 ) , ( 4,3 ) multiplets are possible .",
    "the values of @xmath67 when the operators include only sm decay products are particularly interesting because they are almost totally fixed .",
    "indeed , in these cases the @xmath67 ratios neither depend on any unknown final state that might or might not give crs , nor on the unknown vev of new fields . for a given operator the @xmath67 ratio may only depend on the way the @xmath2 indices are contracted . here",
    "we will consider only the case where the dm particle has vanishing hypercharge ( _ e.g. _  to avoid constraints on direct detection processes mediated by a @xmath64 boson ) and the so called `` inert doublet '' candidate where the dm multiplet is a scalar doublet with the same hypercharge as the sm scalar doublet .",
    "depending on the operator , the hyperchargeless candidates lead to predictions a - e or new predictions , which we call @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "the predictions @xmath110 and @xmath111 correspond to the cases where a @xmath106 , @xmath107 or @xmath108 charged lepton is produced in association to a @xmath77 in the final state .",
    "they are obtained from the @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively , by simply replacing @xmath114 by @xmath115 in eq .",
    "( [ ngammanzphi1ll ] ) .",
    "the predictions @xmath112 and @xmath113 , corresponding to when a sm scalar boson is produced with the @xmath0 and @xmath64 in the 2-body final state , are obtained by simply adding a @xmath116 term in the denominator of the prediction @xmath117 and @xmath118 , respectively .",
    "the resulting constraints are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : sm ] , and the dictionary between signal predictions and possible effective operators for these hyperchargeless multiplets is given in table  [ tab:1 ] .",

    "( [ ophidmy])-([ophidml ] ) , which we call @xmath119 and @xmath120 and depend on whether the dm particle is made of the real ( r ) , of the imaginary ( i ) , or of both components ( ri ) of the neutral component of the inert doublet ( taking the sm scalar vev to be real by convention ) . depending on whether the @xmath121 term in the tree - level scalar potential gives a positive , negative or vanishing mass splitting between the two neutral components ( see e.g.  @xcite )",
    ", these @xmath122 predictions are different because , as for the @xmath121 term , these two operators break the peccei - quinn type symmetry between these two components .",
    "the signal to operator dictionary for this case is given in table  [ tab:2 ] .",
    ".all possible signal scenarios for a hyperchargeless dm candidates decaying into sm particles .",

    "[ fig : sm ] shows that , similarly to what one observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : abcde ] , almost all cases with only sm final states have potential @xmath0-ray line signal strengths that are not restricted by their associated continuum of crs .",
    "the only exception where actual direct limit on a @xmath0-line are weaker is for the @xmath123 cases  mainly because the photon - line emission for this `` v '' labelled operator in eq .",
    "( [ ophidml ] ) , is suppressed by a factor of @xmath124 with respect to the @xmath125 emission .",
    "note that for the cases with prompt charged leptons in the final state , leading to @xmath126 predictions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sm ] , we have checked that the @xmath0 flux from inverse compton interactions of these leptons can be neglected . as for the observational positron and electron constraints",
    "they turn out to not give any further bounds here .    note finally that in table .  1",
    "there is a case where the dm field is a quintuplet . assuming that there is no beyond the sm fields other than this quintuplet , this is the quintuplet of the  minimal dm `` setup @xcite",
    ". the neutral component of this quintuplet is naturally stable enough because ' ' accidentally \" it can not appear in any operator of dimension less than 6 . table .",
    "1 shows that it can lead to a @xmath0-line through the operator of eq .",
    "( [ opsi1dml ] ) , leading to prediction @xmath111 depending on which sm lepton doublet is considered in the operator , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sm ] .",
    "in figs .  [ fig : abcde ] and [ fig : sm ] we took into account only the full list of two - body decays the various operators give .",
    "this is expected to be a good approximation , except for the following case : if the two - body decays proceed through the vev of a scalar and if the dm mass is far above the value of this vev . in this case , if the three - body decay is kinematically allowed , the two to three - body decay - width ratio is expected to be of order @xmath127 . finally note that a uv theory is of course not necessarily expected to induce only one relevant operator . in presence of several operators the cr production could be easily boosted relatively to the @xmath0-line signal , so that the a to g @xmath0-line bounds in figs .",
    "[ fig : abcde ] and [ fig : sm ] would lower accordingly .",
    "alternatively , with several operators there exists also the possibility that the uv physics induces several effective operators that would produce the same final states , leading to a destructive or constructive interference for some of the channels .",
    "this issue is in many respects similar to the well - known one of determining the cut - off of possible new physics that would induce operators composed of only sm fields @xcite ( _ i.e. _   lower bounds on uv cut - offs given in the literature are typically derived for single operators , and they could be decreased if interferences between operators are allowed to be tuned ) .",
    "the variation in @xmath67 that such interferences could cause does highly depend on the operators considered and the multiplet considered in them . for many cases it is not possible to increase sizably @xmath67 in this way . for the other cases it is possible by invoking one or several tunings of the operator coefficients ( _ i.e. _  of couplings and quantum numbers in the uv theory ) .    in a similar vein",
    "one has also to keep in mind that , through renormalization group effects , a single operator generated at a high energy scale can generate other ones at low scale ( although in general with sub - leading coefficients ) .    in conclusion only a few dim @xmath128 effective operator structures can lead to a monochromatic @xmath0-line from dm decay , even if one accounts for possible new bsm particles in the decay products .",
    "each of these operators leads to a @xmath0-line to cr flux - ratio which turns out to be bounded from above and in almost all cases also from below .",
    "this leads to clear possibilities of observing a continuum of crs associated to a detected @xmath0-line . from the observation of a @xmath0-line and/or of a cr",
    "fluxes that these operators could induce , and from the observation / non - observation of multiple @xmath0-lines ( with characteristic energy and height ) , there exists a clear potential to constrain / discriminate various sets of operators .",
