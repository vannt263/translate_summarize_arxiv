    "this requires growth of a circular droplet to a diameter exceeding @xmath114 which is larger than both the intrinsic size limit imposed by the isotropic term in the dipolar energy and the largest droplet sizes observed experimentally for au on few layer graphenes @xcite .    in general",
    "the stability limits for the isotropic and distorted drops show different scaling with the width of the dipole layer @xmath21 .",
    "a size - limited circular droplet has a radius that increases @xmath115 while it is stable against shape fluctuations below a critical radius @xmath116 .",
    "thus in the limit of weak coupling ( large @xmath21 ) a size - limited circular droplet is stable , while for strong electrostatic coupling with @xmath117 interlayer spacing the droplet can undergo an interaction - driven shape instability .",

    "three features of fig . [ lambdas ] are noteworthy .",
    "first , the instability is driven by the terms in our expansion for the shape energy that are quadratic in the deformation amplitudes and have the strongest ( highest power ) dependence on @xmath79 .",
    "thus the instability requires only growth of a droplet past a critical radius for the shape change to occur . at larger @xmath79",
    "there is no mechanism that can restore a stable isotropic solution .",
    "thus sufficiently large droplets are absolutely unstable to this type of shape instability .",
    "second , the renormalization coefficient shows that the crossover from the weakly renormalized regime ( small @xmath77 ) regime to the unstable regime ( large @xmath77 ) occurs over a narrow size range .",
    "this also reflects the very strong @xmath94 dependence of the dominant term in the integrated coupling strength .",
    "thus one expects the fibrils to show a sharply peaked width distribution , as is demonstrated experimentally in fig .",
    "[ widthdist ] .",
    "third , it is striking that the integrated coupling strength is nearly the same for all the modes of deformation of the circular droplet .",
    "ultimately the shape instability is suppressed for large @xmath0 modes because of the @xmath118 scaling of the _ bare _ line tension rather than through the residual @xmath0 dependence in the interaction contribution .",
    "this leads to our simple scaling rule for the @xmath0-dependent critical radii .",
    "finally , we note that previous continuum formulations of this problem inevitably require a finite droplet height to regularize the short distance singularity in the dipole - dipole potential when they are treated as _ point _ dipoles @xcite . in our treatment",
    "this is regularized more naturally by representing the interaction potential using a nonsingular near field form controlled by the finite size of the relevant _ microscopic _ dipoles .",
    "more generally our expression for the interaction - renormalized line energy now can be applied to any repulsive two point potential in the droplet interior .",
    "indeed the scaling form for @xmath119 describes the renormalization of the line tension by any nonsingular bulk interaction .",
