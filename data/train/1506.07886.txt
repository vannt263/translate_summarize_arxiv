    "the same conclusion holds for .",
    "therefore , on longer timescales , the variability of  ( or ) has similar timescale - dependence to the variability of the @xmath55 continuum .",

    "this result is also consistent with @xcite ( see their figure  @xmath262 ) who ( indirectly ) find that  is less variable than the local continuum by exploring the photometric variability as a function of rest - frame wavelength ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our data suggest that the difference between the @xmath55 continuum and  variability decreases with @xmath58 .",
    "that is , as quasar luminosity decreases , the variability amplitude of  increases more slowly than @xmath55 .",
    "this may be related to a changing ionization structure as luminosity changes : this effectively changes the radius of the blr ( as inferred by reverberation - mapping studies , which measure a responsivity - weighted radius ) , and the responsivity ( defined as the ratio of the variability of emission lines to that of continuum emission ) increases with increasing radius @xcite .",
    "we find that  is slightly more variable than , in agreement with previous quasar spectral variability studies @xcite .",
    "the ionizing continuum that drives  ( @xmath258 ) is similar to that driving  ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "therefore , the differences between  and  variability are not likely to be due to the differences in ionizing continuum .",
    "the variability differences might be caused by the fact that  is a recombination line while  is a collisionally excited resonance line ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "each of these processes depends on the changes in incident euv flux in a different way .",
    "this difference might lead to a lower variability of  than .",
    "the differences between  and  might also be caused by the different optical depth for the two emission lines .",
    "since  is a resonance line , its optical depth is expected to be larger than that of . at a sufficiently high density ,  photons will be absorbed and re - emitted many times before escaping the blr .",
    "this process might effectively stabilize changes in  luminosity by diluting the response to continuum changes .",
    "the difference between  and  could also indicate the structure of the blr that emits  is different from the blr that produces .",
    "for instance , it is possible the blr material that emits  extends to larger radius that that of .",
    "therefore , as the quasar continuum varies ,  responds on a wider range of timescales , and the variability of  is again diluted .",
    "some of these ideas are included in the `` local optimally - emitting cloud '' ( loc ) model which assumes that the blr consists of various density gas clouds . a detailed photoionization equilibrium calculation of the loc model reveals that  is less variable than  over most of the typical range of blr conditions @xcite .    our data also indicate that the shapes of the structure functions of  and  are different at @xmath265 days .",
    "these results suggest that the transfer functions of  and  are also different in width : that is , the transfer functions of  and   have different radial profiles . at longer timescales ( @xmath229 days ) ,",
    "the shapes of the structure functions of   and  are similar ( the difference in slope @xmath202 is @xmath236 ) .",
    "this result is expected since the widths of the transfer functions for  and  are both likely less than @xmath266 days .",
    "our comparison of  and  variability is largely limited to low - luminosity quasars due to the low - redshift requirement for each spectrum to include both lines .",
    "it is possible that the relative difference in responsivity between  and  has a luminosity dependence @xcite , and comparing the different variability behavior of  and  over a larger luminosity range would place additional constraints on the physical conditions and excitation sources of the blr .",

    "we found that the shapes of the structure functions of the @xmath55 continuum and those of broad emission lines are different , indicating the transfer functions governing the response of broad emission lines are broad in time .",

    "we do not remove these stars when accounting for the variability of standard stars since these stars were not removed when calibrating the spectra . due to their small number , these stars do not significantly affect the flux calibration .      as a first step , we present the observed distribution of @xmath148 for standard stars .",
    "to do so , we created @xmath276 wavelength bins starting from @xmath277 , each with a width of @xmath278 .",

    "note that the distributions are not gaussian but are instead laplacian which indicates that the spectrophotometric errors are not perfectly gaussian ( and the tails are not due to the variable stars ) .",
    "since the quasar spectra were calibrated using standard stars , we can then use the structure function of standard stars as an estimation of spectrophotometric errors .",
    "_ note that the structure function quantifies the variability of a flux pair , and therefore the spectrophotometric uncertainty for a single epoch is the structure function divided by @xmath283_. the variability of standard stars depends on wavelength , and so we calculated the structure function of standard stars in each wavelength bin separately .",
    "figure  [ fig : sfstar ] plots our results .",
    "it is evident that the structure function of the standard stars is largely constant with @xmath149 for each wavelength bin .",
    "there is a small increase ( within @xmath284 ) at @xmath285 : this is associated with the time between different dark runs in the sdss - rm observations .",
    "the structure function of standard stars depends on wavelength and is the smallest in the @xmath286 band . in the @xmath287 band ,",
    "the scale of the variability is only @xmath288 ( for the iqr estimator ) .",
    "therefore , for a single epoch , the spectrophotometric error of our sdss - rm data is expected to be not smaller than @xmath289 ( also see figure  20 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .",
    "we also checked the variability of 3@xmath291   ( hereafter 3 ) .",
    "physically , we expect that there is no intrinsic variability of 3  on timescales of @xmath292 .",
    "that is , the variability of 3 should be equivalent to that of standard stars . to verify this , we calculated the structure function of 3  while subtracting only measurement errors ( i.e. , @xmath101 in section  [ sec : def ] only accounts for measurement errors ) and compared the structure functions with the expected spectrophotometric errors of the flux pairs .",
    "the expected spectrophotometric errors are the average of the structure function of standard stars at the same wavelength as the 3  ( i.e. , @xmath293 , where @xmath294 is the redshift of the quasar ) .",
    "we divided our sources into subsamples of point sources and extended sources in order to investigate the additional variability due to variable seeing . to investigate the effects of measurement errors on the estimation of the structure function , we binned quasars by @xmath295 . for each sub - sample",
    ", we created three bins : @xmath296 , @xmath297 , @xmath298 .",
    "we required a minimum of @xmath299 so that the measurement errors do not dominate over the spectrophotometric errors .",
    "we then calculated the structure function of each bin .",

    "the variability of [ oiii ] for point sources is nearly identical to the expected spectrophotometric errors . for each bin , we calculated the difference between the structure function and the spectrophotometric errors in quadrature .",
    "the difference is no more than @xmath300 mag , and there is no systematic offset .",
    "in addition , the variability is not a monotonic function of @xmath295 which suggests our @xmath301 cut reliably prevents a bias from large measurement errors dominating the observed variability .",
    "_ therefore , we conclude that our estimation of the spectrophotometric errors is robust_.    figure  [ fig : o3-extend ] plots the structure function for the sub - sample of extended sources .",
    "it is evident that , for each bin , 3  shows excess variability compared to the spectrophotometric errors .",
    "this is due to additional variability ( @xmath302 in the iqr ) from variable seeing in addition to the spectrophotometric errors .",
    "additional variability from seeing changes has consequences for the structure - function estimates of extended sources ( e.g. , if there is a substantial host - galaxy component to the measured @xmath50 luminosity , see section  [ sec : sf5k ] ) .",
