    "the chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) has been tremendously successful in describing low - energy hadronic properties in the non - perturbative regime of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "some of the major goals of low - energy qcd are the study of hadronic form factors , which reflect the static structure , and the investigation of the dynamical hadronic response to the external electromagnetic field via electric and magnetic polarizabilities . to study the dependence of the electric and magnetic polarizabilities on the photon energy , we use the relativistic chpt while applying the multipole expansion approach for the compton structure functions .",
    "unfortunately , the various versions of chpt predict a rather broad spectrum of values for the polarizabilities , introducing theoretical uncertainty .",
    "however , so far chpt is the only theory available in the regime of non - perturbative qcd , so our computational hadronic model ( chm ) employed here is based on relativistic chpt .",
    "chm gives us the opportunity to avoid the low - energy approximation in the compton structure functions and retain all the possible degrees of freedom arising from the su(3 ) chiral lagrangian .",
    "the article is constructed as follows .",
    "section 2 discusses the meson form factor and its role in the pion electroproduction .",
    "section 3 and 4 are dedicated to the dynamical polarizabilities of the mesons and baryons , respectively .",
    "section 5 briefly summarizes our conclusions .",
    "the spatial pion electromagnetic form factor has been addressed in @xcite and is under experimental study currently @xcite . to investigate the behavior of the pion form factor experimentally at momentum transfers @xmath0 and in the transitional region between long - distance and short - distance qcd",
    ", one must use the charged pion electroproduction process .",
    "the two - fold differential cross section for the exclusive pion electroproduction can be parametrized by a well known formula @xcite in terms of photoabsorption cross sections , where each term corresponds to certain polarization states of the virtual photon : @xmath1 here , subscripts l and t correspond to the longitudinal and transverse polarizations of the virtual photon respectively .",
    "parameter @xmath2 is the negative momentum transfer to the hadronic target squared and @xmath3 is the azimuthal angle of the detected hadron in the center - of - mass reference frame . if the experimental setup has the azimuthal acceptance @xcite , it is possible to determine interference terms , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and then extract the longitudinal term @xmath6 by the rosenbluth separation . in the t - pole approximation , the longitudinal term , @xmath6 , is related to the pion form factor , @xmath7 , in the following way : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a pion - proton coupling .",
    "thus , eq.([eq:2 ] ) allows the extraction of the pion electromagnetic form factor for different momentum transfers above the pion production threshold .",
    "as it is well known , the determination of the pion form factor from the pion electroproduction is impacted by radiative corrections , @xmath10 .",
    "the radiative corrections to the electron current and vacuum polarization were calculated in @xcite , and leading hadronic corrections ( two - photon box diagrams ) were addressed in @xcite . in @xcite , it was found that the two - photon box correction could reach as much as -20% for the backward kinematics ( @xmath11 ) and high momentum transfers . in order to calculate the form factor of the pion",
    ", we use the chm from @xcite , which is based on chpt . here",
    ", we do one - loop calculations with a subtractive renormalization scheme for the scale fixed by the charge radius of the pion : ( @xmath12 ) . for the @xmath13 interaction ,",
    "we arrive at the following renormalized amplitude : @xmath14 from this , we can form two form factors - one on - shell and another off - shell ( if one of the pions is off - shell ) : @xmath15 here , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are momenta of the incoming and outgoing pion , @xmath18 is the momentum of the virtual photon , and the functions , @xmath19 , depend on one- and two - point passarino - veltman functions . to incorporate chpt into the calculations of the two - photon box correction",
    ", we fit the pion on - shell monopole formfactor to the form factor in eq.[eq:4 ] for the @xmath20 and get @xmath21 with @xmath22 . a reason to choose the monopole form factor",
    "is its asymptotic behavior at high momentum transfers , @xmath23 , driven by the perturbative qcd . for the off - shell form factor in eq.([eq:5 ] ) , we also choose the monopole form , which is fitted to the chpt off - shell form factor , so we get @xmath24 with @xmath25    , blue line ) and high ( @xmath26 , green line ) hadronic momentum transfers . ]    from fig.[fig3 ] , one can see that our fit is in rather good agreement with experimental data .",
    "we now use the fitted form factors in the calculations of the two - photon box pion electroproduction correction with the same tools for the exact calculations as in @xcite , for high ( @xmath27 ) and low ( @xmath28 ) momentum transfers ( see fig.[fig3 - 1 ] ) .",
    "two lines , @xmath22 ( green dashed line ) and @xmath29 ( red solid line ) , illustrate the box correction sensitivity to the choice of the scale in the form factor .",
    "as can be clearly seen from the right plot of fig.[fig3 - 1 ] , for the low momentum transfer the correction is rather sensitive to the scale , which induces an additional theoretical uncertainty due to the box correction model dependence . for the high momentum transfer ( left plot of fig.[fig3 - 1 ]",
    ", we observe that the correction does not change much with the change of the scale in the form factor .",
    "thus , we observe a reduced degree of model dependence in the correction for high momentum transfers . for the off - shell part of the pion form factor ,",
    "we have observed a contribution of less than 1% to the correction , which certainly diminishes any role of the off - shell form factor in the pion electroproduction process .",
    "experimentally , a unique opportunity to study the dynamical structure of hadrons over a wide kinematic range is provided by compton scattering . in the non - relativistic approximation ,",
    "the hamiltonian related to the meson internal structure can be represented as @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are electric and magnetic polarizabilities of the meson , respectively . up to now , only charged and neutral pion polarizabilities have been measured , producing a broad range of values @xcite .",
    "precision measurements of the charged pion polarizability through the primakoff two - pion photo - production process with linearly polarized photons is planned at jlab . the cross section for this process",
    ", @xmath33 is related to the photon fusion cross section , @xmath34 , which can be easily turned into a compton cross section by means of crossing symmetry . in eq.([eq:7 ] ) , @xmath35 is the @xmath36 invariant mass , z is the atomic number , @xmath37 is the energy of the incident photon , @xmath38 is the electromagnetic form factor for the proton target , @xmath39 is the lab angle for the two pions , @xmath40 is the incident photon polarization and @xmath41 is the azimuthal angle of the @xmath36 system .",
    "one can relate photon fusion cross section , @xmath34 , to the polarizabilities of the pion @xcite as @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 here , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the mandelstam variables , @xmath47 is the meson charge , @xmath48 is the center - of - mass velocity of produced pions and @xmath49 or @xmath50 for a neutral or charged pion , respectively .",
    "eqs.[eq:7 ] and [ eq:8 ] are valid for any meson , not just pions . for real compton scattering",
    ", we can construct an invariant amplitude , @xmath51 here @xmath52 are polarization vectors of incoming and outgoing photons , respectively , and @xmath53 is the compton tensor , which is related to two compton structure functions ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) in the following way : @xmath56 the lorentz tensors , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , are @xmath59 the amplitude related to the meson electric and magnetic polarizabilities can now be rewritten as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the photon energy and @xmath62 denotes the magnetic vector . combining eq.([eq:10 ] ) and ( [ eq:12 ] ) , we get a connection between the polarizabilities and compton structure functions : @xmath63 terms in eq.([eq:13 ] ) are clearly energy - dependent , so we call them dynamical . in the limit",
    "when @xmath64 and @xmath65 , we recover the static values of the polarizabilities . using chm and restricting our calculations to one - loop in chpt ( two - loop su(2 ) calculations were done in @xcite and showed a rather small impact on the cross section in primakoff reaction ) , we calculate the dynamical polarizabilities of mesons including the entire su(3 ) octet of mesons in the loop integrals .",
    "in addition , we include a structure - dependent pole contribution arising from the vector mesons in similar fashion to @xcite .",
    "we now have the following static electric and magnetic polarizabilities ( in units of @xmath66 ) : @xmath67 the pion coupling constant is @xmath68 , @xmath69 is the fine structure constant , the low energy constants are @xmath70 and @xmath71 , and for the vector mesons coupling constants we use @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the polarizabilities for the octet of mesons are summarized in table [ tbl1 ] .",
    ".meson electric and magnetic static polarizabilities [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for all polarizabilities listed in fig.([ff2 ] ) , the electric polarizabilities have very similar resonant - type behavior near meson - production thresholds and the magnetic polarizabilities for all hyperons have negative low energy ( static ) values . once again , it is important to include both pole and loop resonance contributions for a complete analysis .",
    "it is clear that for the all dynamical polarizabilities of the su(3 ) octet of baryons , the values are strongly governed by the excitation mechanism reflected in the meson production peaks .",
    "hence , the study of these polarizabilities directly probes the internal degrees of freedom governing the baryon structure at low energies .",
    "in this work , we have evaluated the pion form factor and have investigated its influence on the behavior of the two - photon box pion electroproduction correction .",
    "we also calculated the dynamical polarizabilities of mesons including the entire su(3 ) octet of mesons in the loop integrals using relativistic chpt implemented in chm .",
    "the dynamical electric and magnetic polarizabilities of the su(3 ) octet of baryons were investigated in detail .",
    "we found that predictions of the chiral theory derived from our calculations ( up to one - loop order and not including resonances in loop calculations ) are somewhat consistent with the experimental results .",
    "the dependencies for the range of photon energies covering the majority of the meson photo production channels were analyzed .",
    "these extensive calculations are made possible by the recent implementation of semi - automatized calculations in chpt , which allows the evaluation of polarizabilities from compton scattering up to next - to - the - leading order .",
    "our current goal is the calculation of dynamical polarizabilities with baryon resonances in the loops .",
    "there is still some disagreement between heavy - baryon and relativistic versions of chpt introducing theoretical uncertainty .",
    "clearly , further experimental work is needed especially for the hyperon and strange mesons polarizabilities , which would help with the further development of the theory .",
    "this work has been supported by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada ( nserc ) ."
