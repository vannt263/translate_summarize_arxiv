    "protoplanetary disks begin as massive , gas - rich remnants of their parent interstellar molecular clouds , but rapidly evolve into tenuous , dusty disks within about 10  myr . these disks , called debris disks , differ from protoplanetary disks in that they are composed of secondary material recently generated by collisions between and evaporation of asteroids and comets .",

    "therefore , we fit atlas9 solar - metallicity photospheric models to the optical and near - ir data @xcite .",
    "the data used were the @xmath113- and @xmath114-band fluxes from the tycho-2 catalog , the @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 fluxes from 2mass , and the color - corrected wise band  1 flux .",

    "however , this fitting procedure could not provide a useful constraint on the stellar gravity .",
    "using the new effective temperature and age estimate , we placed the star on a @xmath120 h - r diagram , forcing it to lie precisely on the 40-myr isochrone .",
    "we used the evolutionary tracks and isochrones with solar metallicity from the yonsei - yale group @xcite . the stellar gravity indicated by the age constraint",
    "is @xmath121 , the corresponding stellar mass is 2 @xmath122 , and the stellar luminosity is 15.5 @xmath123 .",

    "no extinction was applied to the model , which was then normalized to the irs spectrum at 6  @xmath0 m .",
    "the final stellar model is shown with a black solid line in figure  [ fig : sed ] .    a strong check of the internal consistency of the set of stellar parameters consists of using the stellar luminosity derived from the age constraint ( @xmath126 ) and the total photospheric flux ( @xmath127 , computed by integrating the final stellar model ) to recover the observed distance .",
    "using the simple expression @xmath128 , the derived distance is 56  pc , in excellent agreement with the _ hipparcos _ distance of 59  pc .",
    "a lower gravity would imply a larger luminosity and hence a much greater distance ; as an example , @xmath124 k and @xmath129 in the @xmath130 h - r diagram corresponds to a luminosity of 34.67  @xmath123 ( using pms tracks ) or 36.31  @xmath123 ( using post - ms tracks ) .",
    "these luminosities give distances of @xmath131  pc , inconsistent with the _ hipparcos _ distance .",
    "we began our analysis of the 49  cet  dust excess emission with a very simple model , i.e.  the sum of the best stellar model and a single - temperature modified blackbody .",
    "starting from equation  6 in @xcite , an optically thin modified blackbody has the form @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the planck function for temperature @xmath134 , @xmath135 is the optical depth , and @xmath136 is the solid angle of the emitting area ( effectively a constant of proportionality ) . the optical depth is proportional to the dust mass opacity . at mid - ir to mm wavelengths , mass opacities for expected debris disk grains",

    "* ) . at shorter wavelengths ,",
    "the mass opacity for simple astronomical silicate grains abruptly becomes nearly independent of wavelength .",
    "therefore , our formulation for the optical depth is @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the optical depth at reference wavelength @xmath90 and @xmath3 is the emissivity power - law index .",

    "the temperature of the warm component ( @xmath143  k ) is higher than the temperature found by fitting a single - temperature simple blackbody to the irs spectrum alone ( @xmath153  k ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is presumably because we are now accounting for the flux in the irs spectrum coming from the cold component .",
    "the emissivity power - law index found for the cold component ( @xmath154 ) is smaller that the values typically seen in the interstellar medium ( @xmath155 ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this is often seen in protoplanetary and debris disk seds and it indicates that the emitting grains are larger than the typical sub - micron interstellar grains ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "assuming the dust grains are in radiative equilibrium with the central star , we estimated the minimum characteristic radius of each dust component .",
    "starting from equation  1 in @xcite , we adopted simple blackbody grains and used the bolometric stellar flux from our best stellar model .",
    "more realistic grains will be further from the star than simple blackbody grains at the same temperature , so the distances calculated are lower limits on the characteristic dust radii .",
    "the characteristic radius of the warm component is @xmath156  au , while that of the cold component is @xmath157  au .",
    "there are two possible explanations for the gas content of the 49  cet  disk .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the most common previous scenario interprets the co as the last remnant of the primordial gas left over from star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in the first subsection , we describe our attempts to fit the 49  cet  sed and gas observations using a primordial - like disk model .",
    "the next subsection considers the second explanation , that the 49  cet  gas is secondary material coming from the destruction of planetary material .",
    "we began a detailed investigation of the 49  cet  gas emission using an advanced disk modeling code , prodimo , which self - consistently determines the temperature , density , and chemical structure of combined gas and dust disks @xcite .",
    "prodimo calculates the heating and cooling of both gas and dust , and takes into account 960 chemical reactions involving 71 species .",
    "photochemistry , h@xmath12 formation on grain surfaces , and cosmic - ray heating are all included .    as a first step ,",
    "we considered the 49  cet  disk model from @xcite that successfully reproduced the basic features of the spatially and spectrally resolved sub - mm co emission , as well as the dust emission from the outer disk ( the inner disk was ignored ) . in that work ,",
    "steady - state chemistry was adopted and solar elemental abundances assumed .",
    "some key features of the model were 1 ) a lack of gas within 40  au of the star , 2 ) an outer disk radius of 200  au , and 3 ) a total gas mass of @xmath158 .    in the original @xcite model , the gas - to - dust ratio had to be set to the unusually high value of 500 .",
    "this was likely caused by necessary simplifying assumptions about the dust properties : well - mixed gas and dust , a uniform dust composition ( astronomical silicates ) , and a single large grain size .",
    "here we retained the first two assumptions but used a dohnanyi power - law grain size distribution ( @xmath159 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we then calculated several models that reproduced the observed sub - mm co emission while varying other disk parameters ( e.g.  gas - to - dust ratios from 300 to 65 ) . while it was possible to find models that matched the sub - mm co emission and the upper limit on [ ] 63  @xmath0 m  emission , they under - predicted the [ ] 158  @xmath0 m  emission by factors of @xmath160 .    in sum",
    ", simple adjustments to the @xcite model were unsuccessful at simultaneously reproducing the sub - mm co emission , the emission , and the lack of emission .",
    "for example , reducing the oxygen abundance in an attempt to decrease the emission led to less co formation and reduced co cooling , which resulted in a warmer gas disk .",
    "paradoxically , this had the effect of increasing the emission rather than decreasing it .",
    "the only adjustment that showed some promise involved increasing the carbon abundance over the solar value . further work on detailed modeling of the 49  cet  disk with prodimo is underway . for",
    "now , it appears that the observations can not be reproduced with a `` primordial - like '' protoplanetary disk model .",
    "we therefore consider whether the gas could also be consistent with a secondary source from planetesimals .",
    "if so , its composition could shed light on the make - up of the young parent planetesimals  outcomes of the planet formation process and the building blocks of full - sized planets .",
    "questions that can be addressed include whether the parent planetesimals are rocky or icy and whether there are any abundance anomalies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this scenario ,",
    "the presence of relatively abundant co ( for a debris disk ) suggests that this gas comes from icy material , more comet - like than asteroid - like ( as proposed in * ? ? ?",
    "there are several possible mechanisms for its production , including outgassing of comet - like bodies , photodesorption of ice - coated grains , and grain - grain collisions @xcite .",
    "how large a mass of comets would be needed to supply the observed mass of co ?",
    "in equilibrium , the co production rate will match the loss rate .",
    "assuming the co is in a low - density environment , chemical reactions can be ignored and the primary loss mechanism is photodissociation .",
    "therefore , the co loss rate is @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the co number volume density , @xmath163 is the photodissociation rate , @xmath164 is the total number of co molecules , @xmath114 is the total volume of the gas .",
    "given the low @xmath139  value , shielding of the co from dissociating uv radiation by dust grains should be negligible .",
    "shielding by h@xmath12 is hard to assess , although most hydrogen in comets is locked in h@xmath12o rather than h@xmath12 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for now , we ignore the competing effects of shielding and the stellar uv field , and consider only the interstellar field .",
    "the unshielded photodissociation rate for co in a draine interstellar uv field is @xmath165 , giving an unshielded co lifetime @xmath166  yrs @xcite .",
    "the co production rate is @xmath167 where @xmath168 is the fractional abundance of co relative to water in comets , @xmath169 is the water production rate , and @xmath170 is the total number of @xmath171 molecules .",
    "observations of solar system comets show @xmath168 values ranging from about @xmath172 to @xmath173 @xcite .    equating the production and loss rates",
    "shows that equilibrium is achieved for a water mass loss rate of @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the total mass of h@xmath12o , @xmath176 is the mass of a h@xmath12o molecule , @xmath177 is the mass of a co molecule , and @xmath178 is the total mass of co ( @xmath179 ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the water mass loss rate needed to produce the observed co is @xmath180 since comets are mostly water , we can adopt these values as approximate comet mass loss rates .",
    "collisional modeling of the solar system s kuiper belt predicts an initial mass of @xmath181 @xcite .",
    "scaling this value up by the larger stellar mass of 49  cet  ( @xmath182 ) gives an initial planetesimal mass of @xmath183 . with the loss rates given above",
    ", it would take between roughly 0.4  myr and 32  myr to exhaust the total initial planetesimal mass .",
    "since the star is likely to be @xmath7  myr old @xcite , this analysis would suggest that if the co is being produced from comets , it is a relatively short - lived phenomenon .",
    "the dissipation of abundant primordial material left over from star formation sets crucial constraints on the formation of planetary systems . on one hand ,",
    "the removal of the gas limits the time available for formation of gas giant planets . on the other hand ,",
    "the presence of a modest amount of gas during the later stages of formation can help damp the inclinations and eccentricities of terrestrial planets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , understanding the speed of gas dissipation and the mechanisms by which it occurs is vitally important for informing planet formation theories .",
    "primordial dust lifetimes are fairly well - constrained by observations to be @xmath184  myr , although there is a large dispersion in values for individual stars of nearly the same age and uncertainties remain about the effects of stellar mass , binarity , and star - forming environment ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "determining gas lifetimes , one of the primary goals of the _ herschel _  gasps project , is far harder .",
    "while arguments can be made that gas and dust dissipate on roughly similar timescales @xcite , there is significant uncertainty about the co - evolution of gas and dust ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "from this perspective , 49  cet  might be a nearly unique disk system that is just finishing dissipation of its primordial gas . with gas emission reminiscent of a low - mass protoplanetary disk , 49  cet",
    "does look to be in some sort of intermediate state .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the presence of an inner dust disk that lacks significant molecular gas could be consistent with disk dissipation from the inside out through photoevaporation , if the inner disk grains are large enough not to be entrained in a photoevaporative flow ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with the previous age estimate of @xmath185",
    "myr @xcite , 49  cet  would have a relatively long but not implausible primordial gas lifetime .",
    "however , the new 40  myr age @xcite requires an anomalously long lifetime for the observed co to be primordial gas .",
    "our preliminary disk modeling with prodimo casts further doubt on the 49  cet  gas being primordial , since we have great difficulty fitting all the gas observations with a low - mass but otherwise normal protoplanetary disk model .",
    "looking at 49  cet s dust properties , it greatly resembles a young debris disk .",
    "the low fractional dust luminosity ( @xmath186 of a typical herbig ae disk value ; * ? ? ? * ) and the lack of 10  @xmath0 m  silicate emission indicating few small grains in the warm inner disk are both highly characteristic of debris disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "all of the estimated ages for 49  cet  could place it in a late stage of terrestrial planet formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , recent work has shown that many debris disk seds are best fit by two - temperature models , like 49  cet , suggesting radially separated inner and outer dust belts @xcite .",
    "the 49  cet  gas may also be secondary debris material coming from destruction of planetesimals .",
    "our simple calculations of gas production from comet - like ices indicate that the amount of material required to produce the observed co is not implausibly large .",
    "unfortunately , we are not able to say at this time if the lower limit on the mass and non - detection of emission are also consistent with the comet - evaporation scenario .",
    "first , if the gas is coming from planetesimals , then the parent species for the bulk of the carbon gas is not necessarily co. in the better - studied case of @xmath3  pic , balancing production by photodissociation of co with loss by photoionization suggests that only about 2% of the total carbon gas comes from dissociation of co @xcite .",
    "since the primary atomic gas production mechanism is likely to be photodesorption of grain surfaces or grain - grain collisions , many other materials could supply carbon gas to the disk ( e.g.  amorphous carbon ) .",
    "this makes interpreting the lower limit on the 49  cet   mass difficult .",
    "second , while we expect oxygen gas as an end - product of water ice evaporation , we are not able to turn the observed flux upper limit into a useful oxygen mass upper limit ( see section  [ sub : gas_mass ] ) .    however , recent monitoring of lines in optical spectra of 49  cet  show absorption features that are variable in both strength and velocity shift @xcite .",
    "similar features are also seen in spectra of @xmath3  pic and are attributed to so - called `` falling evaporating bodies '' ( febs ) , which are star - grazing planetesimals passing through the line of sight to the central star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , each absorption feature is effectively a transit of an exo - comet or exo - asteroid . taken together , the difficulty fitting the 49  cet  observations with a primordial disk model , the possibility of producing the observed co from comet - like material , and the detection of gas - producing planetesimals all indicate that 49  cet  is a close analog of the better - understood @xmath3  pic debris disk .",
    "tighter constraints on the gas - to - dust ratios in both systems , through more accurate determination of dust masses and measurements of additional gas species , would help confirm their similarity and allow studies of the effect of the gas on grain dynamics .",
    "the _ herschel _  far - ir imaging and spectroscopy of 49  cet  has provided an extremely rich dataset for better characterizing both the dust and gas .",
    "our primary findings are as follows .    1 .   in our 70  @xmath0 m  image ,",
    "dust continuum emission from the outer disk is spatially resolved for the first time .",
    "the disk orientation agrees with that determined from spatially and spectrally resolved sub - mm co emission , suggesting the gas and dust are co - spatial .",
    "the deconvolved image does not show a central clearing in the dust ; the gaussian hwhm along the disk major axis is @xmath30  au .",
    "the [ ] 158  @xmath0 m  emission line was detected at the @xmath187 level in a preliminary shallow spectrum and at the @xmath188 level in a deep follow - up spectrum .",
    "no other emission lines were detected , including [ ] 63  @xmath0 m .",
    "the integrated line flux is @xmath189 , giving an ionized carbon gas mass @xmath103 . with various assumptions",
    ", this suggests a lower limit on the total atomic gas mass of @xmath109 .",
    "simple modeling of the new sed confirms the two - component structure of the disk .",
    "we find blackbody temperatures of 175  k for the inner dust and 62  k for the outer dust , implying characteristic radii of @xmath156  au and @xmath157  au .",
    "preliminary thermochemical modeling of the combined gas and dust disk indicates that a `` primordial - like '' protoplanetary disk model can not simultaneously reproduce all the gas observations .",
    "the gas may instead be secondary material coming from the destruction of comet - like ices .",
    "the next step in our work on the 49  cet  system is fitting the sed with an advanced dust disk modeling code ( grater ; * ? ? ?",
    "this code includes realistic grain properties and can take into account the powerful constraints provided by resolved imaging , as was done in our modeling of the hd181327 debris disk @xcite .",
    "the new dust disk model will provide a more accurate dust mass and can be input to prodimo for further exploration of the disk parameter space .",
    "we will also experiment with prodimo runs in `` debris disk mode , '' adopting time - dependent chemistry and non - solar starting compositions . through these and other studies",
