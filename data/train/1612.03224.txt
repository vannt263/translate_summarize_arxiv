    "the number of new publications every year is growing rapidly .",
    "for example , on defect prediction , 729 studies were published on ieee xplore during the year of 2005 while 1,564 studies were published during the year of 2015 .",
    "given this increasingly faster pace of software engineering ( se ) research , it has become harder and harder to remain current with the state - of - the - art research in software engineering .",
    "systematic literature reviews ( slrs ) are one approach to this problem .",
    "slrs are a well established and widely applied review method in software engineering since kitchenham , dyb , and jrgensen first adopted it to support evidence - based software engineering in 2004 and 2005  @xcite .",
    "researchers can get a general idea of current activity in their field of interests by reading the slr studies .",
    "furthermore , a deeper understanding of the topic may be gained by conducting an slr .",
    "an increasing number of slrs has been conducted since the proposal and revision of the slr guidelines by kitchenham in 2007  @xcite .",
    "for example , there are 26 slrs on ieee xplore during the year of 2005 and the number has increased to 137 for the year of 2010 and 199 for the year of 2015 .",
    "various scholars suggest that an slr is required before any research in software engineering is conducted  @xcite .",
    "while this is certainly a good advice , currently an slr is a large , time consuming and complex task  @xcite .",
    "the goal of our research is to reduce the effort of an slr to days of work and make it practical to be conducted frequently .",
    "previously we have analyzed the costs of slrs  @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : barrier ] , primary study selection , which is noted as `` selecting papers '' in figure  [ fig : barrier ] , is among the top three most difficult as well as time - consuming aspects in an slr .",
    "usually , reviewers need to evaluate thousands of studies trying to find dozens of them that are relevant to the research questions based on their title , abstract , or full text .",
    "an extreme example of this is where reviewers sourced over 3,000 studies , and only used 7 of them in their final review  @xcite .",
    "the cost associated with primary study selection has become a serious problem and will continue to grow in the near future as the population of candidates for primary studies increases dramatically .    the problem of how to read more materials , faster , has been studied by many fields .",
    "researchers in evidence - based medicine rely on extensive reading studies in order to survey their field  @xcite .",
    "also , researchers exploring `` electronic discovery '' have developed algorithms to quickly discover what documents are most relevant to a particular legal summons  @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to check if any of those methods from other fields can assist slrs in software engineering .    to accomplish this , we explored state - of - the - art methods in machine assisted reading from medical and legal domains .",
    "it turns out , those methods were not exactly suited to slrs for se .",
    "however , by breaking them apart and refactoring them , we created fastread , a new state - of - the - art method for machine assisted slrs in software engineering .",
    "we recommend fastread because :    * using fastread , 90% of the `` relevant '' studies can be retrieved by reviewing only 10% of the candidate studies .",
    "that is , fastread can significantly reduce the cost of se slrs . * on se slrs",
    ", fastread performs remarkably better than state - of - the - art methods from medical and legal domains .",
    "the rest of this paper defines and refactors machine assisted reading techniques from evidence - based medicine  @xcite and electronic discovery  @xcite .",
    "to assess our newly refactored methods , we need some `` gold sets '' , against which we can compare different methods .",
    "fortunately , in the arena of software engineering , there exist very prominent `` gold sets '' as published slrs .",
    "this paper explores two such slrs : wahono et al .",
    "2015  @xcite and hall et al .",
    "2012  @xcite .",
    "we choose these since they seem to be the state - of - the - art in this arena .",
    "one is very recent ( 2015 ) , the other is highly cited ( 305 citations ) , and both define their work in enough details for us to try to reproduce their results using automatic methods .",
    "more details about the `` gold sets '' will be presented later in section  [ sect : data sets ] . using these `` gold sets ''",
    ", we ask and answer the following four research questions :    * * rq1 : what are the costs of a standard slr primary study selection ? * according to our literature survey , it usually requires months of tedious work for a standard slr primary study selection .",
    "* * rq2 : what are the state - of - the - art machine assisted reading methods ? * the state - of - the - art machine assisted reading techniques are patient active learning from evidence - based medicine and continuous active learning from electronic discovery .",
    "these two methods are explained later in section  [ sect : evidence - based medicine ] and [ sect : electronic discovery ] . *",
    "* rq3 : should we just adopt the state - of - the - art methods from other fields ?",
    "is it possible to build a better one by mixing and matching from those ?",
    "* we should not just adopt the state - of - the - art methods from other fields . by refactoring those state - of - the - art techniques",
    "we build our method called fastread , which outperforms both the existing state - of - the - art techniques . * * rq4 : how much effort can fastread save in an slr ? * in our two case studies , fastread is able to retrieve @xmath0 of the relevant studies by reviewing only @xmath1 of the candidates .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are :    * a demonstration of the value of machine learning techniques for assisting primary study selection in se slrs . * the adaptation of two state - of - the - art methods from evidence - based medicine and electronic discovery to se slrs . * the evaluation of our new method .",
    "the experiments shown below indicate that fastread saves 90% review efforts on primary study selection . * the development of a simple tool for machine assisted reading .",
    "this tool is explained at the end of this paper and is available for download on github .",
    "in contrast to a primary study , which investigates a specific research question , a systematic literature review is a form of secondary study aimed at identifying , evaluating and interpreting all available research relevant to a particular research question , topic area , or phenomenon of interest  @xcite . in the modern academic world , it is impossible to start a research without first knowing what other researchers have done in the topic area .",
    "conducting an slr is one way to gain background knowledge on a certain topic area .",
    "if that slr is published , then that paper becomes a useful research tool for other researchers .",
    "kitchenham recommend slrs to be standard procedure in se research  @xcite .",
    "an slr is usually conducted following the procedures in figure  [ fig : slr ] .",
    "there can be variances on the real implementations  @xcite , but all are based on the same guideline  @xcite . in this study , we focus on step 6 : primary study selection .     +",
    "* rq1 : what are the costs of a standard slr primary study selection ?",
    "*          primary study selection starts with an initial candidate collection of studies retrieved by searching . in the first round of that process , the reviewers job is to read the titles and abstracts of candidate studies and classify each as `` relevant '' or `` irrelevant '' .",
    "after the first round of review , the reviewers read through the full text of the previously included studies and make further decision on whether it is actually `` relevant '' or not .",
    "the whole procedure is shown in figure  [ fig : prime ] . in this study , we focus on how to utilize machine learning algorithms to speed up the `` exclude irrelevant studies '' step .    typically , reviewers need to identify a final list of dozens of primary studies among the initial collection of thousands of candidates . in terms of actual cost , malheiros",
    "has documented in @xcite that it requires 3 hours for one reviewer to review 100 studies .",
    "this implies that it is a month s work for one graduate student to review 3000 studies or three month s work to review 9000 studies .",
    "also , in our previous studies , primary study selection has been identified as one of the top three most time - consuming and difficult step in slr  @xcite , as well as one of the top desired features to be automated by tools and has not yet been supported  @xcite .",
    "the target of this paper is to reduce the cost of the primary study selection by applying machine learning techniques to assist the review process since :    a major cost in slr is the effort associated with primary study selection .",
    "months of tedious work are required to review thousands of candidate studies .      in recent years",
    ", various tools have been developed to facilitate slrs in software engineering community , as summarized in  @xcite .",
    "these tools aim at providing support for protocol development  @xcite , automated search  @xcite , primary study selection  @xcite , quality assessment  @xcite , data extraction and validation  @xcite , data synthesis  @xcite , and report write up  @xcite .",
    "it is extremely helpful to have a tool for managing the whole slr process .",
    "however , the support for primary study selection using these tools is limited ( e.g. , to tasks such as assigning review jobs to multiple reviewers or to resolving disagreements ) .",
    "hence , we assert that the current se slr literature provides no tool that can offer reductions in the effort required for primary study selection comparable to those reductions offered by machine assisted reading .",
    "visual text mining ( vtm ) is a technique especially explored in software engineering community to support slr .",
    "it is an unsupervised learning method which visualizes the relationship between candidate studies and helps the reviewer to make quick decisions .",
    "malheiros et al .",
    "@xcite first applied vtm to support primary study selection in slr . in their small - scale experiment",
    "( 100 candidate studies , 31 of which are `` relevant '' ) , vtm retrieves around 90% of the `` relevant '' studies by spending about 30% as much time as manual review .",
    "however , vtm requires some prior experience and knowledge of text mining and visualization techniques to use  @xcite , and more case studies with large scale are needed to validate their results .",
    "after the study of  @xcite , instead of being applied to assist primary study selection , vtm has been further explored to support systematic mapping  @xcite , validate the primary study selection result  @xcite , and the continuing update of slr  @xcite .",
    "vtm has thus been proved to be a powerful technique to help user better understand the hidden relationship between selected primary studies .    in this paper",
    ", we are exploring a different direction to reduce cost in primary study selection . instead of an unsupervised learning technique such as vtm",
    ", we use semi - supervised learning method . given the performance of our method",
    " i.e. , 90% of the `` relevant '' studies can be found by reviewing only 10% of the candidate studies  we suggest that slr authors use our method for primary study selection but also use tools like vtm before and after the selection process to have a better understanding of the studies .",
    "the potential of combining vtm and machine assisted reading to further boost primary study selection is also considered in our future research .",
    "our work is the first to explore machine - assisted - reading for primary study selection in the software engineering community  @xcite .",
    "however , other recent studies do focus on the search process for systematic literature reviews .",
    "zhang et al .",
    "@xcite assessed the qgs - based systematic search process for slrs and found that use of such a search process can help both to identify more relevant studies and to save the time spent in the search process .",
    "jalali and wohlin  @xcite compared the use of two different search approaches  database search and backward snowballing  as the first step in the search process for se slrs and found that neither approach is the superior choice for the first step in the search process .     + * rq2 : what are the state - of - the - art machine assisted reading techniques ? *      systematic literature reviews were first adopted from evidence - based medicine in 2004  @xcite .",
    "to facilitate citation screening ( primary study selection ) in systematic review , wallace conducted a series of studies with machine learning techniques , especially active learning  @xcite .",
    "wallace first set up a baseline approach called `` patient active learning '' , which will be explained later in this subsection , for machine learning assisted citation screening  @xcite .",
    "the performance of patient active learning is good enough ( nearly 100% of the `` relevant '' citations can be retrieved at half of the conventional review cost ) to convince systematic review conductors to adopt machine learning assisted citation screening . instead of improving this baseline method , wallace then focused on other aspects of machine learning assisted citation screening such as introducing external expert knowledge  @xcite , allocating review tasks to multiple experts  @xcite or to crowd sourcing workers  @xcite , and building a tool called abstrackr to provide overall support  @xcite .",
    "wallace s work on this topic is of exemplary high - impact and his core algorithm ( on simple expert screening ) , is the most popular machine assisted reading technique we have found in the evidence - based medical literature .",
    "that said , this technique has not been updated since 2010  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are focused on cost minimization .",
    "hence , we do not explore techniques such as wallace s use of multiple experts ( but in future work , we will explore this approach ) .",
    "other work related to machine learning assisted citation screening do not utilize active learning and machine assisted reading .",
    "pure supervised learning requires a sufficiently large training set , which leads to a huge review cost  @xcite .",
    "therefore the patient active learning proposed by wallace et al .",
    "is still the state - of - the - art method for citation screening in the scenario with no external knowledge and equally expensive reviewers .",
    "details on patient active learning will be provided in section  [ sect : patient active learning ] .",
    "electronic discovery ( e - discovery ) is a part of civil litigation where one party ( the producing party ) , offers up materials which are pertinent to a legal case  @xcite .",
    "this involves a review task where the producing party need to retrieve every `` relevant '' document in their possession and turn them over to the requesting party .",
    "it is extremely important to reduce the review cost in e - discovery since in a common case , the producing party will need to retrieve thousands of `` relevant '' documents among millions of candidates .",
    "technology - assisted review ( tar ) is the technique to facilitate the review process .",
    "the objective of tar is to find as many of the `` relevant '' documents in a collection as possible , with reasonable cost  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the relationship between e - discovery and evidence - based medicine have been discussed in  @xcite but their methods are still diverged . relying on grossman and cormack  @xcite for support ,",
    "many legal service providers have adopted tar to facilitate the review process .",
    "the machine assisted reading methods applied in tar are simple passive learning , simple active learning , and continuous active learning .",
    "so far , in every controlled studies , continuous active learning has outperformed others  @xcite , which makes it the state - of - the - art method in tar .",
    "details on continuous active learning will be provided in section  [ sect : continuous active learning ] .    in summary",
    ":    the state - of - the - art machine assisted reading techniques are patient active learning in evidence - based medicine and continuous active learning in e - discovery .",
    "in this section , we provide details on technical terms used in the paper , along with some brief introductory notes on machine learning techniques used in machine assisted reading",
    ".      support vector machine ( svm ) is a well - known and widely used classification method .",
    "the idea behind is to map input data to a high - dimension feature space and then construct a linear decision plane in that feature space  @xcite .",
    "linear svm  @xcite has been proved to be a useful model in se text mining  @xcite and is applied in the state - of - the - art machine assisted reading methods of both evidence - based medicine and electronic discovery  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : svm ] illustrates linear svm model on a two - dimension feature space .",
    "active learning is a cost - aware machine learning algorithm where labels of training data can be acquired with certain costs .",
    "the key idea behind active learning is that a machine learning algorithm can perform better with less training if it is allowed to choose the data from which it learns  @xcite .",
    "there are several scenarios active learning is applied to , such as membership query synthesis , stream - based selective sampling , and pool - based sampling  @xcite .",
    "there are also different query strategies of active learning , such as uncertainty sampling , query - by - committee , expected model change , expected error reduction , variance reduction , and density - weighted methods  @xcite . here",
    ", we will briefly introduce one scenario and two query strategies , which will be used in our later experiments and discussions .",
    "* pool - based sampling * is the scenario of primary study selection .",
    "this scenario starts with a fixed size pool of unlabeled data .",
    "labels for the data can be acquired by querying an oracle selectively .",
    "the goal of pool - based sampling is to select the most informative data in the pool for query , thereby building a better model with less training .",
    "* uncertainty sampling * is the query strategy utilized in the state - of - the - art machine assisted reading technique of evidence - based medicine  @xcite .",
    "it is also recognized as the most simple and commonly used query strategy  @xcite . in this query strategy , uncertainty sampling queries the instances about which the learner is least certain how to label .",
    "these instances are those ( a ) whose posterior probability of being positive are nearest 0.5 in probabilistic models or ( b ) closest to the decision boundary in models such as svm .",
    "a demonstration of certainty sampling with svm model can be found in figure  [ fig : svm ] .",
    "* certainty sampling * is another query strategy which is applied in the state - of - the - art machine assisted reading technique of electronic discovery  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to uncertainty sampling , certainty sampling queries the instances about which the learner is most certain to label as positive .",
    "these instances are those ( a ) whose posterior probability of being positive are highest in probabilistic models , or ( b ) lies in the positive side of the decision boundary and furthest to the decision boundary in models such as svm .",
    "a demonstration of certainty sampling with svm model can be found in figure  [ fig : svm ] .",
    "this query strategy is usually not used when building the classifier of active learning since it is commonly believed that examples queried by certainty sampling contains less information than those by uncertainty sampling .",
    "machine assisted reading is a combination of manual review and machine suggestions  @xcite . in this approach :    * humans read a stream of documents , commenting on whether or not each one is `` relevant '' .",
    "* machine learners use feedback from the human opinion to incrementally update their models actively . *",
    "the models generated via machine learning are used to sort the stream of documents such that the humans focus on the most informative documents .",
    "machine assisted reading is a pool - based active learning scenario since ( 1 ) the process starts with a fixed size candidate list without any labels and ( 2 ) training examples gradually become available to the learner as the human reviewer reviews the documents .",
    "however , a significant difference between machine assisted reading and other active learning methods is that every document labeled as `` relevant '' has been reviewed by a human .",
    "the machine never makes the final decision on whether a document is `` relevant '' ; a human makes such decisions and the machine only suggests a review order based on the human s input . as a result , instead of building a better classification model , the objective of machine assisted reading is to retrieve most `` relevant '' documents from a pool of candidates while manually reviewing as few documents as possible .",
    "simple active learning , which is pool - based active learning with uncertainty sampling  @xcite , is the most basic form of learning methods applied to machine assisted reading .",
    "although simple active learning achieves satisfactory performance , it has been outperformed by the state - of - the - art machine assisted reading techniques in both evidence - based medicine  @xcite and electronic discovery  @xcite .",
    "the state - of - the - art machine assisted reading method in evidence - based medicine , patient active learning can be described as following  @xcite :    * * stage i : construct an initial seed training set * by random sampling from the candidate study pool and asking a human reviewer to label the papers in the set as `` relevant '' or `` irrelevant '' . stop and proceed to stage ii when _ enough _ `` relevant '' studies have been retrieved to represent the `` relevant '' class .",
    "( note that wallace et al .",
    "@xcite do not provide an explicit definition of",
    "_ `` enough''_. ) * * stage ii : build the classifier * , which is a linear svm , by repeatedly training on labeled studies and uncertainty sampling .",
    "unlabeled studies in the pool will be ranked in the descending order of uncertainty ( uncertainty sampling ) .",
    "the human reviewer labels the studies in the ranked order and feeds them back to retrain the classifier .",
    "stop and proceed to stage iii when the classifier is _",
    "stable_. ( note that wallace et al .",
    "@xcite do not provide an explicit definition of _",
    "`` stable''_. ) * * stage iii : prediction . *",
    "retrain the classifier with aggressive undersampling and then stop training .",
    "unlabeled studies in the pool will be ranked in the descending order of the classifier s prediction probability of being `` relevant '' ( certainty sampling as discussed in section  [ sect : active learning ] ) .",
    "the human reviewer labels the studies in the ranked order until finished ( running out of review cost budget , enough `` relevant '' studies found , or no more `` relevant '' studies are detected in multiple rounds ) .",
    "* aggressive undersampling : * the data for citation screening are ( at times , extremely ) imbalanced , i.e. , the prevalence of `` relevant '' citations is always smaller than @xmath2 ( and often much smaller ) .",
    "classification algorithms are typically optimized for overall accuracy , rather than accuracy , precision , recall to a particular class .",
    "this becomes a problem when only the performance on a minority class matters .",
    "patient active learning utilizes aggressive undersampling for data balancing . by throwing away majority ( `` irrelevant '' ) class training examples which are closest to the svm decision hyperplane , it undersamples the majority class training examples to the same size as minority ( `` relevant '' ) class .",
    "it is a recall friendly undersampling method since the new decision hyperplane is pushed away from the minority class .",
    "an exampling of aggressive undersampling is shown in figure  [ fig : svm ] .",
    "the state - of - the - art machine assisted reading method in e - discovery , continuous active learning can be described as following  @xcite :    * * stage i : construct an initial seed training set * by random sampling from the candidate study pool and ask a human reviewer for labels . stop and proceed to stage ii as soon as * one * `` relevant '' study is retrieved . * * stage ii : predict and retrain * by repeatedly training on labeled studies and certainty sampling .",
    "unlabeled studies in the pool will be ranked in the descending order of the classifier s prediction probability of being `` relevant '' ( certainty sampling ) .",
    "a human reviewer labels the studies in the ranked order and feeds them back to retrain the classifier until finished .",
    "in contrast to patient active learning , continuous active learning is the opposite of `` patient '' .",
    "it starts to train the model as soon as _",
    "one _ `` relevant '' study shows up and skips the uncertainty sampling stage , which is believed to be essential for active learners  @xcite .",
    "the reason for this `` greedy '' strategy can be derived from the objective of machine assisted reading mentioned in section  [ sect : machine assisted reading ] .",
    "since the objective is to retrieve `` relevant '' studies with candidates reviewed as few as possible , it is reasonable not to waste any single effort on building up the classifier  @xcite .",
    "also , the experiment results in @xcite has demonstrated the value of this `` greedy '' strategy .",
    "this section describes our data sets and their preparation then describes and refactors state - of - the - art methods for machine assisted reading .",
    "this refactoring process will create fastread , our preferred machine assisted reading method .",
    "although a large number of slrs are published every year , there is no data set clearly documenting the details in primary study selection . as a result ,",
    "two data sets are collected from existing slrs and being used in this study .",
    "the first data set is extracted from the slr on defect prediction by wahono in 2015  @xcite .",
    "the second data set is extracted from the slr on defect prediction by hall and et al . in 2012  @xcite .    for each of the data set",
    ", we retrieve the initial candidate collection from ieee xplore with the search string stated in the original literature .",
    "then make a final list of inclusion by comparing the initial collection retrieved and the final list proposed in the corresponding slr . here ,",

    "the first difference is because , as stated in @xcite , the search string is always refined manually in order to retrieve a satisfied candidate study list .",

    "this refinement of search string is actually a common attempt to reduce the size of candidate study list , thus save review effort in primary study selection with some sacrifice on completeness . with machine assisted primary study selection ,",
    "the refinement of the search string is no longer necessary , because we can now tackle large candidate study list with a small amount of effort .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the completeness will even increase when 90% of `` relevant '' studies are retrieved , given that we now have a richer candidate list of studies .",
    "the second difference is mainly because the candidate study lists are retrieved from ieee xplore only , while some of the `` relevant '' studies in the final inclusion lists of @xcite are not in ieee xplore .",

    "<S> , fastread outperforms the current state - of - the - art methods . + </S>",
    "<S> * results : * using fastread , it is possible to find @xmath0 of the studies found by standard manual methods , but after only reading less than @xmath1 of the candidate studies . </S>",
    "<S> + * conclusions : * with the help of fastread , conducting an slr is much more efficient and less difficult . </S>",
    "<S> software engineering researchers now have no excuse : they should conduct slrs .    </S>",
