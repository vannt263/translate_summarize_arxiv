    "the ( 2j+1)-fold degeneracy of the single - ion s hund s rule ground state with total momentum @xmath10 is lifted by the crystal electric field ( cef ) and the lowest - lying sublevel is a doublet , which almost completely consists of the @xmath11 state with @xmath12 for the ho(dy)-based material  @xcite . for each ion ,",
    "the local quantization axis points from the corner to the center of the tetrahedron , _",
    "i.e. _ along one of the @xmath13 directions of the cubic structure .",
    "because the energy difference to the first excited sublevels is of the order of 200300  k , the low - temperature magnetism of both materials can be well described by non - collinear @xmath14 ising spins with large magnetic moments of about 10  @xmath15 .",
    "antiferromagnetic exchange interactions are so weak that the dipolar interactions dominate , which favor a six - fold degenerate groundstate with two spins pointing into and two out of each tetrahedron .",

    "spin creates a pair of `` 3in/1out '' and `` 1in/3out '' excitations on neighboring tetrahedra and due to the ground - state degeneracy",
    "such a pair fractionalizes into two individual excitations that can freely propagate through the crystal and can be described as independent magnetic ( anti-)monopoles .",
    "the dynamics of these anomalous excitations is subject of intense research  @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we discuss the influence of such magnetic monopole excitations on the heat transport of spin - ice materials .",
    "as @xmath0  and @xmath1  are good insulators , the heat transport is dominated by phonons and the magnetic excitations may influence the total heat transport in two ways .",
    "the magnetic excitations might add an additional contribution to the heat transport or they scatter with phonons and therefore suppress the phonon heat transport .",
    "in general , both effects are present and as an approximate ansatz the superposition @xmath16 can be used , where both individual contributions @xmath5 and @xmath6 are reduced compared to their hypothetical bare values by phonon - magnon scattering . concerning the above - described monopole excitations in spin ice ,",

    ", some similarities between the monopole / antimonopole excitations and the two - spinon continua of one - dimensional quantum spin chains can be expected . during the last years",
    ", intense studies of the ( magnetic ) heat transport of low - dimensional quantum spin systems have been performed , but still many aspects are not yet understood  @xcite .    for low - dimensional spin systems , the expected anisotropy of @xmath6",
    "is typically used to separate it from @xmath5 .",
    "this strategy is not possible in the three - dimensional spin - ice materials , but weak magnetic fields in the range of less than 1  t are sufficient to lift the ground - state degeneracy and thus to prevent the monopole / antimonopole deconfinement and somewhat larger fields even cause a full saturation of the magnetization , meaning that any types of magnetic excitations can be strongly suppressed due to the large zeeman splitting .",
    "another strategy to separate @xmath5 and @xmath6 is to study ( non-)magnetic reference compounds of the same structure . for the spin - ice materials this can be achieved by the substitution series @xmath17 and @xmath18 because of the very similar ionic radii of @xmath9 , @xmath8 , and the non - magnetic @xmath19 .",
    "the magnetic - field dependent heat transport of @xmath1  has been studied by different groups and a significant decrease of @xmath20 in the low - temperature range is observed  @xcite .",
    "@xcite assume a purely phononic heat transport in zero field and a field - induced suppression of @xmath5 by some field - dependent scattering mechanisms which is not further specified .",
    "this differs from our interpretation  @xcite , which is based on the comparative study of @xmath17 for @xmath21 , 0.5 , and 1 .",
    "our data reveal that , in the field range above about 1.5  t , a very similar dy - related , field - induced suppression of @xmath7 is present for both , the spin ice @xmath1  and the highly dilute @xmath4 , which does not show spin - ice behavior . in @xmath1 , however , we observe an additional low - field dependence of @xmath20 , whose anisotropic field dependence and hysteresis behavior clearly correlates with the spin - ice physics .",
    "this evidences a sizeable @xmath6 in zero field , which is successively suppressed by the application of a magnetic field due to the field - induced suppression of the monopole mobility .",
    "experimental evidence for a zero - field monopole contribution to the heat transport has been also proposed from an analysis of @xmath22 of @xmath0@xcite .",

    "[ fig:1](e ) , the magnetization of both materials is essentially saturated above about 1  t in this low - temperature range .",
    "the opposite field dependences of @xmath20 are not related to the spin - ice physics , which mainly takes place below 1  t. in the field range below about 0.5  t , @xmath20 of both materials shows a rapid drop , which can be attributed to a field - induced suppression of @xmath39 . in particular towards higher temperature , this effect is significantly less pronounced in @xmath0  than it is in @xmath1 . on this qualitative level , the data of fig .",

    "as the spin - ice physics in these materials is almost completely suppressed , these data yield clear evidence that the opposite field dependences of @xmath20 of the dy- and the ho - based materials arise from different field dependences of the phononic background .",
    "this raises the question why @xmath7 decreases with increasing field in @xmath4  and increases in @xmath3 . as described above",
    ", localized magnetic moments may serve as scattering centers for the phonons and because spin flips are suppressed in large magnetic fields , this mechanism can explain an increase of @xmath7 as it is observed in @xmath3 , but it can not explain the decreasing @xmath7 of @xmath4 . as we have already discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the decrease of @xmath7 is probably related to magnetic - field induced lattice distortions , which arise from the fact that the local quantization axes of the magnetic ions at the different corners of each tetrahedron are not collinear .",
    "consequently , for any direction of the external magnetic field at least 3/4 of the magnetic ions feel a symmetry - breaking transverse field component , which mixes the higher - lying levels into the groundstate doublet , which in zero field almost completely consists of the @xmath45 state  @xcite .",
    "this effect causes a van vleck susceptibility , which is seen as a finite positive slope of the high - field magnetization data that varies between about 0.3 to 1%/t , depending on the sample and the field direction  @xcite .",
    "a further consequence is a pronounced anisotropic magnetostriction , _ i.e. _ field - induced length changes @xmath46 . in @xmath1",
    ", we found a significant elongation of @xmath47 and weak contractions of @xmath48  @xcite . within a simplified classical picture ,",
    "such field - induced lattice distortions may be visualized as resulting from the finite torques @xmath49 , which tend to align the non - collinear localized magnetic moments towards the field direction . with respect to the phononic heat transport",
    ", @xmath7 may decrease with increasing field due to the reduced lattice symmetry .",
    "in addition , the spin - flip rate may also increase due to the stronger mixing of the @xmath45 states with other @xmath50 levels , but this effect should vanish towards larger fields when spin flips are suppressed by the enhanced zeeman splitting . summarizing the discussion so far",
    ", there are different mechanisms which may either increase or decrease @xmath7 and it is difficult to predict which of them dominates .",
    "experimentally , we find that the dy- and the ho - based materials are very different in this respect and this difference is not restricted to @xmath7 . as is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:1](f ) and  [ fig:2](d ) , the magnetostriction for both dy - based materials is about 4 times larger than that of the corresponding ho - based ones .",
    "this suggests that the stronger magnetostriction in the dy - based materials seems to make the distortion - induced decrease of @xmath7 the dominant process , whereas in the ho - based materials the decreasing phonon scattering by spin flips is dominant .     of the ho - based ( left ) and the dy - based ( right ) spin - ice materials @xmath51ti@xmath25o@xmath26  with the corresponding @xmath20 of the respective non - spin - ice reference materials @xmath44yti@xmath25o@xmath26 .",
    "the inset of panel ( a ) shows an expanded view of the low - field range.[fig:3 ] ]    because the electronic configurations of @xmath9  and @xmath8  just differ by one electron ( @xmath52 _ vs. _ @xmath53 ) in the inner @xmath54 shell , it may appear surprising that the magnetostriction @xmath55 and the magnetic - field dependent phonon heat transport @xmath7 of the dy- and the ho - based materials are so different .",
    "however , both quantities depend on various material parameters and , in particular , the differences in the crystal - field level schemes of both ions may become important  @xcite , _",
    "e.g. _ the fact that there is a kramers protection of the zero - field doublet states of @xmath9  but not for those of @xmath8 . with respect to the question of a possible heat transport via magnetic monopoles ,",
    "the different @xmath7 in the higher - field range are of minor importance because the spin - ice behavior is restricted to low fields .",
    "therefore , the main question in this context is , whether it is possible to obtain a reliable estimate of the phononic background .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] we directly compare representative @xmath20 measurements of the spin - ice materials @xmath0  and @xmath1  with @xmath20 of @xmath3  and @xmath4 . unfortunately , it is not possible to simply consider the difference between the @xmath22 curves of the pure and the respective reference material .",
    "the main reason is that the absolute values of @xmath2 of different samples differ , which is partly due to experimental errors as , _",
    "e.g. _ , the exact determination of the sample s geometry .",
    "this uncertainty should not exceed 20% and could be treated by a temperature- and field - independent scaling factor .",
    "more important for a transport property is , however , its dependence on defect and impurity scattering . because @xmath2 usually increases with increasing sample quality , one may expect somewhat lower values of @xmath2 for the dilute reference compound than for the pure spin - ice .",
    "this is more or less fulfilled for the dy - based materials , but not for the ho - based ones .",
    "if , however , the above - described spin - flip scattering is a dominant scattering mechanism for @xmath5 in a certain temperature and field range , its decrease due to the lower ho content may overcompensate an increasing ho / y - disorder scattering in the dilute material .",
    "in addition , @xmath5 can be reduced by scattering via crystal - field excitations of the partially filled @xmath54 shells of ho and dy , but due to the rather large energy splitting this effect should become relevant towards higher temperatures and , indeed , @xmath56 of @xmath57  significantly exceeds that of @xmath1  in the range of about 2 to 100  k  @xcite . due to all these reasons and the possibility that even the half - doped materials may still show some remnant spin - ice behavior we have to conclude that an unambiguous quantitative determination of the phonon background @xmath7 is not possible . as already discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , it appears reasonable to assume an essentially field - independent @xmath58 in the low - field range . because @xmath59)$ ] of @xmath1  shows a step - like decrease to a pronounced plateau around 1  t , which anticorrelates with the rapid saturation of the magnetization for this field direction , we estimated @xmath58 by these plateau values and derived the magnetic heat transport for different field directions via @xmath60 . from this analysis , which has to be restricted to the low - field range below about 1  t , we derived in ref .",

    "[ fig:4 ] ]    an analogous analysis is more difficult for @xmath0 , because the @xmath20 curves do not show plateau - like features around 1  t ( see fig  [ fig:1 ] ) . concerning the comparison with the data of @xmath3 , it is also clear that again considering just the difference of both data sets does not yield reliable results",
    "nevertheless , this comparison reveals that the low - temperature @xmath20 curves of @xmath0  show a sharp low - field decrease suggesting the presence of a sizeable @xmath6 in zero - field , whereas the corresponding @xmath20 curves of @xmath3  only weakly change with field for @xmath73  t ( see figs .",
    "[ fig:2 ] and  [ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "thus , it appears again reasonable to assume an essentially field - independent @xmath58 for @xmath0  and in order to get at least a rough estimate of @xmath74 we assume @xmath75 .",
    "these differences at various fixed temperatures then yield an estimate of the temperature - dependent zero - field @xmath76 for @xmath0 , which is compared to the corresponding @xmath76 of @xmath1  in fig .",

    "with respect to a possible monopole heat transport , the direction of the heat flow should be of minor importance , because an isotropic monopole mobility can be expected in @xmath77 .",
    "moreover , one may also expect that a possible monopole contribution @xmath76 should be of comparable order of magnitude for the two spin - ice materials @xmath0  and @xmath1  because of the very similar energy scales characterizing their spin - ice behavior . in view of the above - described experimental uncertainties ,",
    "the comparison of our @xmath76 data of both materials essentially confirms these expectations , which is a basic result of this work .",
    "moreover , our data clearly indicate that @xmath76 of @xmath0  is significantly smaller than @xmath76 of @xmath1 .",
    "this difference can be naturally explained by an enhanced spin - flip / phonon scattering in @xmath0 , which would simultaneously explain the reduced @xmath6 and @xmath5 in zero field and the observed increase of @xmath7 with increasing @xmath78 .",

    "our data of fig .",
    "[ fig:4](e , f ) clearly show that using the high - field data @xmath81 as an estimate of @xmath58 overestimates this background considerably and causes a drastic underestimate of the corresponding zero - field @xmath82 . in ref .",

    "@xcite insofar that the difference @xmath85 is systematically decreasing with decreasing temperature and one may also suspect a sign change at somewhat lower temperature .",
    "in conclusion , we observe clear experimental evidence for a sizeable magnetic contribution @xmath6 to the low - temperature , zero - field heat transport of both spin - ice materials @xmath0  and @xmath1 .",
