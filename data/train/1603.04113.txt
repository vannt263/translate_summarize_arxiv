    "density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite has provided valuable information of the electronic structure for a wide range of materials over several decades .",
    "however , it is now well known that popular approximations in dft such as local density approximation ( lda ) and generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) lack accuracy for strongly correlated systems .",
    "one possible strategy to go beyond is to develop highly accurate dft functionals .",
    "such trials have improved the situation to some extent , but the exact form of the exchange - correlation energy functional is out of reach owing to its non - trivial nature .    another strategy is to employ a promising theoretical framework independent of dft : wave function theory ( wft ) such as quantum chemical methods  @xcite and several flavors of novel quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods  @xcite .",
    "wft explicitly handles a many - body wave function , which enables systematic improvement of accuracy .",
    "although this strategy works well for molecular systems , we have been faced with expensive computational cost for solids as a result of such an explicit treatment of many - body problems . from this viewpoint , the transcorrelated ( tc )",
    "method  @xcite , one of wfts , has been attracting much attention because of its fascinating advantages with practical computational cost .",
    "the tc method makes use of a single - particle picture under an effective hamiltonian explicitly represented with the jastrow correlation factor . for molecular systems ,",
    "some recent works have shown a high potentiality of the tc method  @xcite .",
    "optimization of the wave function with a help of monte carlo integration  @xcite and development of the canonical tc theory  @xcite are also remarkable recent innovation . for solid - states calculations , the tc method is shown to reproduce accurate band structures  @xcite and optical absorption spectra  @xcite . the tc method and a related theory",
    "have been successfully applied also to the hubbard model  @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that the tc method has a close relationship with some qmc methods in the sense that both methods employ the jastrow correlation factor .    as of now",
    ", the tc method has been applied only to weakly correlated systems in solid - states calculations . to apply the tc method to strongly correlated solids",
    ", it is necessary to employ an efficient basis set for representing the one - electron orbitals in the tc method . in the former studies",
    "@xcite , the tc orbitals are expanded with the lda orbitals .",
    "whereas a small number of lda orbitals is required for convergence in weakly correlated systems , its number will inevitably increase when one handles localized states , which are not well - described by lda . as a matter of fact",
    ", we shall see that an enormously large number of lda orbitals are sometimes required and then computational requirement becomes very expensive .",
    "this problem should be resolved for further advance in the tc method , especially for application to strongly correlated systems .",
    "note that because an effective hamiltonian in the tc method is non - hermitian , whether an efficient convergence is achieved in the tc method just like other conventional methods is a non - trivial problem .    in this study",
    ", we develop an iterative diagonalization scheme in solving a one - body self - consistent - field ( scf ) equation in the tc method using a plane - wave basis set .",
    "we find that a subspace dimension to represent the tc orbitals drastically decreases compared with the former lda - basis approach .",
    "this new development enhances applicability of the tc method to various systems . as a test",
    ", we apply our new algorithm to some simple @xmath0-electron systems with deep core states ( i.e. , a part of the deep core states are not just included in pseudopotentials but explicitly treated in a many - body wave function ) and clarify how the core electrons affect the tc band structures .",
    "treatment of core electrons has recently been recognized as an important issue to be taken care of . in",
    "the _ gw _ method  @xcite , it has been pointed out that an error arising from the pseudopotential is not negligible in some cases  @xcite . the same situation was reported also in qmc calculations  @xcite . in the tc method , such an effect has not been investigated , but to elucidate the impact of core electrons on the band structure is an important and unavoidable problem .",
    "in addition , because the tc method employs a many - body wave function common to some qmc methods , such investigation will provide a valuable information also for the qmc community .",
    "we find that an explicit treatment of core states improves a position of deep valence states whereas the band structures in upper energy region do not exhibit large changes , which means that our choice of the jastrow factor can provide consistent electronic structures for a wide energy range whether the core electrons are explicitly treated or not .",
    "our findings in this study encourage application of the tc method to strongly correlated materials with @xmath1 electrons where an explicit treatment of semi - core @xmath0 electrons with the same principal quantum number will be necessary  @xcite .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we give a brief introduction of basic features of the tc method . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , we present a block - davidson algorithm to solve a one - body scf equation in the tc method using a plane - wave basis set . in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] , we demonstrate how efficiently our new algorithm works , and using this algorithm , we compare the band structures calculated with core electrons explicitly treated in many - body wave functions and those just included in pseudopotentials for some simple @xmath0-electron systems .",
    "section  [ sec:5 ] summarizes this study .",
    "since a detailed theoretical framework of the tc method was presented in previous papers  @xcite , we just make a brief review here . in electronic structure calculations ,",
    "our objective is to solve the schr \" odinger equation @xmath2 for the many - body hamiltonian @xmath3 under the external potential @xmath4 , @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes a set of spatial and spin coordinates associated with an electron .",
    "first , we formally factorize the many - body wave function @xmath7 as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the jastrow factor @xmath10 and @xmath11 is defined as @xmath12 . next",
    ", we perform a similarity transformation of the hamiltonian as @xmath13 in this way , the electron correlation described with the jastrow factor is incorporated into the similarity - transformed hamiltonian @xmath14 , which we called the tc hamiltonian hereafter . a jastrow function @xmath15 is chosen as the following simple form :  @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 with @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 being the number of electrons in the simulation cell , the volume of the simulation cell , and the static dielectric constsant , respectively .",
    "core electrons effectively included in pseudopotentials are not counted in the definition of @xmath18 , which should be the same as that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamil ] ) . a choice of @xmath20 in this study shall be described in sec .",
    "[ sec:4a ] .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of this function is determined so as to reproduce the screened electron - electron interaction in solids @xmath21 in the long - range limit  @xcite and satisfy the cusp condition  @xcite in the short - range limit . to satisfy the exact cusp condition for singlet and triplet pairs of electrons",
    ", one should adopt the operator representation of the jastrow function , which introduces troublesome non - terminating series of the effective interaction in the tc hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "thus we use the approximated cusp conditions in the same manner as in qmc studies  @xcite .",
    "because this jastrow function captures both the short- and long - range correlations , a mean - field approximation for the tc hamiltonian is expected to work well . here",
    "we approximate @xmath11 to be a single slater determinant consisting of one - electron orbitals : @xmath22 $ ] , and then a one - body scf equation is derived : @xmath23 \\notag \\\\ - \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{j=1}^n \\sum_{k=1}^n \\int \\mathrm{d}x_2 \\mathrm{d}x_3\\   \\phi_j^*(x_2)\\phi_k^*(x_3)v_{\\mathrm{3body}}(x_1,x_2,x_3 )   \\notag \\\\",

( [ eq : scf ] ) , one can optimize tc one - electron orbitals",
    ". this procedure costs just the same order as the uncorrelated hartree - fock ( hf ) method with a help of an efficient algorithm  @xcite . by construction",
    ", @xmath11 can be systematically improved over a single slater determinant  @xcite , which is an important advantage of the tc method , but in this study , we focus on the case where @xmath11 is supposed to be a single slater determinant .",
    "we note that the non - hermiticity of the tc hamiltonian originating from the non - unitarity of the jastrow factor is essential in the description of the electron correlation effects .",
    "it is obvious that the purely imaginary jastrow function @xmath28 that makes the jastrow factor exp[@xmath29 unitary can not fulfill the cusp condition and the long - range asymptotic behavior mentioned before .",
    "although some previous studies adopted approximations for the effective interaction in the tc hamiltonian to restore the hermiticity for molecular systems with a small number of electrons  @xcite , it is unclear that such approximation is valid for general molecular and periodic systems .",
    "therefore , in this study , we explicitly handle the non - hermiticity of the tc hamiltonian without introducing additional approximations .",
    "we also mention the bi - orthogonal formulation of the tc method , which we called the bitc method .",
    "the bitc method was applied to molecules  @xcite and recently also to solids  @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of the bitc method can be found in these literatures . in the bitc method , we use left and right slater determinants consisting of different one - electron orbitals : @xmath30 $ ] and @xmath31 $ ] , respectively , with the bi - orthogonal condition @xmath32 and the normalization condition @xmath33 .",
    "then a one - body scf equation becomes slightly different from eq .",
    "( [ eq : scf ] ) in the sense that ` bra ' orbitals @xmath34 are replaced with @xmath35 . because the similarity transformation of hamiltonian introduces non - hermiticity , such formulation yields a different result from the ordinary tc method . in this study",
    ", we investigate both the tc and bitc methods .",
    "in the former studies of the tc method applied to solid - state calculations , we have used lda orbitals as basis functions to expand the tc orbitals in solving the scf equation for efficient reduction of computational cost  @xcite .",
    "this prescription works well if a moderate number of lda orbitals are required for convergence as in previous studies .",
    "however , this is not necessarily the case when we deal with the systems where tc and lda orbitals are expected to exhibit sizable differences , e.g. , for strongly correlated systems . to overcome this problem , we develop an iterative diagonalization scheme using a plane - wave basis set .",
    "because the tc hamiltonian is non - hermitian owing to the similarity transformation , some standard methods such as the conjugate gradient ( cg ) method  @xcite do not work and so we adopted the block - davidson algorithm  @xcite . whereas the block - davidson algorithm has been successfully applied to other conventional methods such as dft , some modifications described below are necessary to adopt it to the tc method .",
    "figure  [ fig : algo ] presents a flow of our calculation .",
    "here we define the tc - fock operator @xmath36 $ ] as @xmath36\\phi_i(x)$ ] equals the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : scf ] ) .",
    "our algorithm consists of a double loop . in the inner loop labeled with @xmath37",
    ", a subspace dimension is gradually increased . in the outer loop labeled with @xmath38",
    ", the tc - fock operator is diagonalized in that subspace and the convergence is checked .",
    "both indices start from @xmath39 .",
    "detailed description of the algorithm is presented below .",
    "first , we begin with the initial trial vectors @xmath40 and eigenvalues @xmath41 of the tc - fock operator , i.e. the initial estimates of the tc orbitals @xmath42 and the eigenvalues of the @xmath43 matrix in eq .",
    "( [ eq : scf ] ) , at each @xmath44-point @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the number of bands to be calculated here .",
    "these initial estimates are obtained in the previous @xmath47-th outer loop , where @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) is satisfied . in the first loop ,",
    "i.e. @xmath50 , we set lda orbitals and their energies as initial guesses .",
    "next , we calculate @xmath51 where @xmath52-\\epsilon_m^{(q)})v_m^{(p , q)}(\\mathbf{g})\\ ] ] for the wave vector @xmath53 and the preconditioner @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath55 is defined later .",
    "the preconditioner is introduced to reduce numerical errors by filtering high - energy plane waves .",
    "diagonal elements of the fock operator in terms of a plane - wave basis set are usually used in the preconditioner , but their evaluation requires sizable computational effort for the tc method owing to the existence of the three - body terms .",
    "thus we tried two types of the preconditioner : ( i ) using diagonal elements of the kinetic energy @xmath56 and ( ii ) an empirical form proposed by m. c. payne _ et al . _",
    "@xcite in the context of the cg method @xmath57 where @xmath58 we found that both schemes sufficiently improve the convergence of calculations .",
    "here we used the latter one , but no large difference is observed for calculations in this study . then we perform the gram - schmidt orthonormalization for @xmath59 and obtain @xmath60 where @xmath61 is orthogonalized with @xmath62 ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) and @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "in other words , the gram - schmidt orthonormalization is performed for @xmath67 vectors , @xmath68 , and only @xmath69 are changed .",
    "the subspace for diagonalization is now spanned with these @xmath67 vectors .",
    "then we return to the beginning of the @xmath37 loop and continue to expand the subspace dimension up to @xmath70 .",
    "after the end of the inner @xmath37 loop , we evaluate the matrix elements of @xmath71 $ ] in the subspace spanned with @xmath62 ( @xmath63 , @xmath72 ) , and then diagonalize it .",
    "the eigenvectors and eigenvalues obtained here are used as the initial guesses for the next @xmath38 loop : @xmath73 and @xmath74 where the only @xmath46 eigenvectors and eigenvalues are picked up from the lowest eigenvalue .",
    "trial vectors @xmath75 included in @xmath71 $ ] are updated for every @xmath76 loops of @xmath38 , i.e. , @xmath55 is defined as ( the maximum multiple of @xmath76 ) @xmath77 not exceeding @xmath38 . at the same time as such update",
    ", we check convergence for @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the occupation number , instead of a bit expensive evaluation of the total energy in the tc method .",
    "@xmath79 is always 0 or 1 in this study but can be a fractional number for metallic systems .",
    "if we store the matrix elements of the one , two , and three - body terms in the fock matrix separately , the total energy can be efficiently evaluated and future implementation along this line is possible , but the present convergence criteria does not arise any problem in this study . for band structure calculation after an self - consistent determination of the occupied orbitals@xcite , we instead check convergence of @xmath80 . if convergence is achieved , we once evaluate the total energy for output and calculation ends .",
    "otherwise , the @xmath38 loop is continued . in principle , other convergence criteria are also applicable , e.g. , that with respect to the electron density .",
    "all updates , evaluation of matrix elements , generation of new basis , the gram - schmidt orthonormalization , and diagonalization in our algorithm are performed simultaneously with respect to the @xmath44-points .",
    "we comment on the choice of the parameters . in this study , we fixed @xmath81 to be 2 , i.e. , the max value of the subspace dimension is @xmath82 .",
    "we also fixed @xmath76 to be 3 for scf calculations .",
    "we verified that these choices work well both for accuracy and efficiency in this study .",
    "for the bitc method , we employ essentially the same algorithm , but the orthonormalization condition is replaced with the bi - orthonormalization conditions : @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( @xmath49 ) where @xmath85 are the left trial vectors  @xcite .",
    "note that the left and right eigenvectors are obtained simultaneously in the subspace diagonalization .    to improve the speed of convergence",

    "experimental lattice parameters used in this study were also the same as those in ref .",
    "lda calculations were performed with tapp code  @xcite to make an initial guess for tc orbitals .",
    "subsequent tc calculations were performed with tc++ code  @xcite .",

    "these calculations are called lda - basis and plane - wave - basis calculations hereafter .      to see",
    "how efficiently our new algorithm works , we performed band structure calculations for bulk silicon with core states .",
    "this is because a regular setup , bulk silicon without core states , requires only a small number of subspace dimension both for lda - basis and plane - wave - basis calculations and is not appropriate as a test case here . in figure",
    "[ fig : bandconv ] , we present the convergence behavior of the band structure for bulk silicon with core states in terms of the number of bands @xmath46 , where the subspace dimension for diagonalization is @xmath46 and @xmath89 for lda - basis and plane - wave - basis calculations , respectively ( see section  [ sec:3 ] ) . band gaps between the highest valence and lowest conduction bands at the @xmath90 point , that between the highest valence band at the @xmath90 point and the lowest conduction band at the @xmath91 point , and the valence bandwidth at the @xmath90 point are shown here . a cut - off energy of plane waves was 256 ry , and a @xmath92 @xmath44-point mesh was used throughout this subsection .",
    "convergence of the total energy is also shown in figure  [ fig : econv ] .    in these figures",
    ", we can see that lda - basis calculations require an enormously large number of the subspace dimension .",
    "even when we used 800 lda bands , the direct gap at the @xmath90 point still exhibits an error of about 0.8 ev compared with the well - converged value obtained in plane - wave - basis calculation .",
    "total energy also shows much slower convergence in lda - basis calculation than in plane - wave - basis calculation .",
    "because one needs to take such a huge number of lda bands even for bulk silicon when one explicitly takes the core states into account , lda - basis calculation for more complex materials such as strongly correlated systems seems to be intractable both in computation time and memory requirement . on the other hand ,",
    "plane - wave - basis calculations require a moderate number of bands to achieve sufficient convergence especially for the band structure calculations .",
    "figure  [ fig : banditer ] presents the convergence behavior of the band structure with respect to the number of iterations for lda - basis and plane - wave - basis calculations .",
    "lda - basis and plane - wave - basis calculations shown here were performed with the number of bands @xmath46 being 800 and 60 , respectively , where the convergence errors in calculations with two basis sets are comparable using these values of @xmath46 as we have seen in figs .  [ fig : bandconv ] and [ fig : econv ] .",
    "the number of iteration here denotes that for the outer loop described in section  [ sec:3 ] for plane - wave - basis calculations .",
    "since we did not calculate the total energy at each iteration in plane - wave - basis calculations as noted in section  [ sec:3 ] , we only show data for the band structure .",
    "we verified that about 5 iterations are sufficient to obtain convergence within an error of 0.1 ev for both basis sets in this case .",
    "as for the computation time , one iteration takes about 60 and 22 hours without parallelization on our workstation for lda - basis and plane - wave - basis calculations , respectively .",
    "note that lda - basis calculation with the number of bands @xmath93 still does not achieve sufficient convergence as mentioned in the previous paragraph , which means that , to achieve the same level of accuracy , lda - basis calculation needs much longer computation time and larger memory requirement than plane - wave - basis calculation .    ) and plane - wave - basis ( @xmath94 ) calculations.,width=8 ]      as a test of our new algorithm , we investigated the band structures with core states using a plane - wave basis set .",
    "because accurate calculation of the total energy with an explicit treatment of core electrons requires sizable computational effort , we concentrate on the band structures in this study .    in figure  [ fig : lih ] , we present the band structures of lih calculated with the tc and bitc methods using a @xmath95 @xmath44-mesh and @xmath96 .",
    "we used 49 and 169 ry for the cutoff energy of plane waves in without - core and with - core calculations , respectively .",
    "there is almost no difference between the tc and bitc band structures for this material .",
    "we can see that the position of the valence band is affected by inclusion of core electrons , which improves the agreement of the calculated band gap with experimental one as presented in table  [ table : band ]  @xcite .",

    "cutoff energies of 121 and 900 ry and @xmath99 and @xmath100 were used for without - core and with - core calculations , respectively .",
    "we again see that an explicit inclusion of core electrons makes the position of the deepest valence band a bit shallow .",
    "a similar trend is found also for si , where the overestimated valence bandwidth is improved by an inclusion of core states as presented in table  [ table : band ] .",
    "this feature can be relevant to the observed overestimation of the valence bandwidth for bulk silicon calculated with the state - of - the - art diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) method  @xcite . in the upper energy region ,",
    "band structures of @xmath97-sic are again almost unchanged but exhibit some differences between with - core and without - core calculations .",
    "the difference in the bitc band structures can be interpreted as mere shifts for each angular momentum .",
    "the tc band structures , on the other hand , show changes that are not constant shifts .",
    "note that these slight changes are natural because our jastrow factor is different between with - core and without - core calculations as mentioned before .",
    "furthermore , the lda core states used to construct our lda pseudopotentials should be different from those in the tc and bitc methods , which naturally can , in principle , produce complicated changes in the band structures .",
    "in addition , the deep core states explicitly included in the many - body wave function are expected to dominate the wave - function optimization , which can affect the obtained eigenvalues in the upper energy region .",
    "it is noteworthy that , nevertheless , the bitc band structures are always improved by an inclusion of deep core states as shown in table  [ table : band ] , for materials we calculated here .",
    "the position of the deepest valence bands is always improved both for the tc and bitc methods .",
    "further investigation for different materials is an important future issue .",
    "it is also an important future issue to construct ( bi)tc pseudopotentials that are free from the aforementioned pseudopotential errors evaluated in our analysis .",
    "such development is a nontrivial task because of the difference of the jastrow factor among with / without - core calculations for solids and atomic calculations required in constructing the pseudopotentials , but the similarity between the band structures obtained in with - core and without - core calculations is a hopeful observation for this purpose .",
