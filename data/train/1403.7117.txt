    "we therefore observed the galaxy in the 3 and 0.8 mm bands in alma cycle 0 and also made supplemental 1.3 mm observations with the sma .",

    "all alma data were calibrated from the raw data in a uniform manner using the casa reduction package versions 4.0 and 4.1 .",
    "most notably , we used the ` butler - jpl - horizons 2012 ' model for titan and mars in our flux calibration , measured and accounted for the spectral slopes of our bandpass and gain calibrators in our calibration , and checked the flatness of our spectral bandpass by looking at the spectrum of the gain calibrator after all calibrations .",

    "therefore , when one of the two linear polarizations on a baseline was found faulty the remaining one was copied over the corrupted one and both the original and copied visibilities were down - weighted to conserve the net weights of the rescued data .",

    "the continuum has been subtracted from our line data in the  domain for the csvcycle 0 data and in the image domain for the rest .",
    "this is because we are most interested in weak and broad line emission near the phase center in the former dataset while better subtraction across the imaging area is more desired for other datasets .",
    "parameters of our reduced data are summarized in tables [ t.data_cont_properties ] and [ t.data_line_properties ] . compared to our previous sma observations the new alma observations improved spatial resolution by about a factor of three and sensitivity in line brightness temperature by about an order of magnitude .",

    "we expect similar or higher recovery rates for other band 3 lines and continuum but the recovery rate must be lower for emission in band 7 because the central hole in the  plane is larger in band 7 .",

    "the peaks of line emission are in the vicinity of the two nuclei , the spiral feature running between the two nuclei , and in the linear feature across the western nucleus , particularly in its western side .",
    "at least for these regions , our data do not show significant decline of ( integrated ) intensity in higher transitions that would suggest significantly subthermal excitation or significant increase in ( integrated ) intensity arising from optically - thin emission from thermalized warm molecular gas .",
    "other lines are much weaker than the  lines , having peak brightness temperatures at about 1 k or lower .",
    "possible reasons for this include that these lines are optically thin , have lower excitation temperatures than  ( i.e. , subthermally excited ) , and are emitted from smaller regions than the  lines .      the total flux of co line emission is measured to be @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 jy   for j=10 , 21 , and 32 transitions , respectively , in a 20  diameter aperture centered at the midpoint of the two nuclei .",

    "we note that the co(21 ) to co(10 ) flux ratio at about 3  resolution , 4.0 with 10% calibration uncertainty , is what is expected for the thermalized optically thick gas at @xmath30 k. the two data sets have about the same ranges of baseline length in units of wavelength and hence the ratio must be affected little by missing flux .",
    "the co(32 ) to ( 21 ) ratio at about 06 resolution is 1.9 in flux and 0.86 in brightness temperature .",

    "[ f.spectra.nuclei ] .",
    "moreover , much of the high - velocity emission peaks slightly offset from the nuclei where any passband error could make the largest artifact .",
    "secondly , it is unlikely that the high - velocity emission is due to line - blending , i.e. , from lines other than the target line , in part because of the offset of the high - velocity emissions from the nuclei where all lines peak and also because of the lack of molecules that may plausibly contribute to the observed emission .",
    "individual line wings of a single co transition sometimes have possible alternative sources , such as ( 3837 ) and ( 43 ) on the red ( i.e. , low - frequency ) side of co(32 ) .",

    "in addition , the peak of the emission on the red side of co(32 ) is not exactly at the redshifted frequencies of ( 3837 ) and ( 43 ) .",
    "[ f.spec.noblend ] shows this in the spectrum sampled at the midpoint of the two nuclei .",
    "the peak of the redshifted component clearly does not coincide with the expected frequencies of ( 3837 ) and ( 43 ) .",
    "therefore their contribution to the high - velocity emission should be small , if any . finally , the line wings are unlikely due to the response pattern of the spectral correlator to a strong narrow line , as this would appear symmetric about the line center .",

    "it is expected to form because gas is not collisionless unlike stars and hence can not remain on the original disks at the larger radii where the two disks have already collided with each other . although the small visible perturbation in the observed co velocity field can be also because the northern galaxy , whose nucleus we found to be more massive than the southern one , had a dominant fraction of gas in the system , the presence of two tidal tails makes it unlikely that the large scale gas disk is only from the northern galaxy .",

    "one is that the low - luminosity agn is very efficient in driving the radio and molecular jets and the other is that the agn was previously active but is currently inactive possibly due to the quenching effect of the outflow .",

    "@xcite determined it implausible that the broad line emission is reflected light of an agn broad line region citing the lack of a luminous agn that can illuminate the scattering ism several kpc away .",

    "if the broad line emission at least 3 kpc away from the southern nucleus is a light echo of the past activity , the nucleus was ( much more ) active @xmath147 yr ago .",

    "a caveat for the scenario that the southern outflow was driven by a radio jet from a recently deactivated agn is that agn radio jets are not preferentially aligned with the galaxy rotation axes @xcite though a good alignment was recently reported for sgr a@xmath150 @xcite .",
    "the southern outflow and the southern nuclear disk have apparent alignment at least in the projection onto the sky .",
    "unless this is another case of intrinsic galaxy - jet alignment , this probably suggests collimation by the nuclear disk",
    ". it may be through interaction of a radio jet and the nuclear gas concentration , perhaps through which the jet is loaded with molecular gas .",
    "alternatively , the alignment might be because the outflow is not entrained by a radio jet but driven by some other mechanisms including a compact starburst , agn , and their combination where the nuclear disk works as a collimator .",
    "star formation in the southern nucleus is active , having one third of the star formation in the northern nucleus @xcite fueled by the high surface - density gas of @xmath40 .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to expect some contribution of star formation to the southern outflow .",
    "if the southern outflow is driven mainly by starburst then the kinetic luminosity of the outflow must be much lower than that calculated from our fiducial conversion factor and outflow inclination ; these parameters must be lower than we assumed .",
    "on the whole we regard that agn jet - driven outflow is more plausible than others to be the main mechanism for the southern molecular jet .",
    "some help from starburst is certain .",
    "this model is , however , not yet proven and needs further studies for verification and to determine the true driving mechanism(s ) .",
    "we have reported our alma and sma observations of molecular line and continuum emission in the center of ngc 3256 .",
    "we constrained the configuration of the two merger nuclei and their nuclear molecular disks much better than before and resolved for the first time the high - velocity molecular gas in the merger into two molecular outflows from the two nuclei .    we have suggested the southern molecular outflow from ngc 3256s to be driven by an agn bipolar jet .",
    "if confirmed , it joins a small group of outflows that share the same driving mechanism and have been imaged in molecular line(s ) .",
    "they include the molecular outflows in m51 @xcite , ngc 1266 @xcite , and ngc 1433 @xcite . compared with these outflows , the bipolar molecular jet of ngc 3256s is better collimated and more energetic for a common .",
    "this may be because the agn radio ` jets ' in the other galaxies are wider radio plumes . mainly because of the large outflow velocity , the kinetic luminosity of the southern outflow approaches that of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies and quasar hosts observed by @xcite , who obtained outflow kinetic luminosities on the orders of @xmath151@xmath152 w with a conversion factor 3 times lower than ours .",
    "the large maximum velocity of the southern outflow is also comparable to or larger than those in their survey but this is probably because ours is helped much by the high alma sensitivity and the proximity of ngc 3256 .",
    "the overall significance of agn - driven , jet - entrained molecular outflows is an open question .",
    "agn time variability similar to the one we suggested for ngc 3256s may reduce the apparent agn contribution to galactic molecular outflows . regarding jet - entrained outflows , on one hand ,",
    "radio jets have been found only in minority of agns .",
    "for instance , @xcite found `` linear '' structures of radio continuum in 14/52 = 27% of optically selected , nearby seyfert galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "the parameters of our southern outflow imply that a jet - entrained outflow can be more powerful and efficient than other outflows when normalized by the source bolometric luminosity .",
    "it is possible therefore that the small number and/or short lifetime of the outflows driven by agn radio jets are offset to some extent by their efficiencies and luminosities .",
    "the two molecular outflows in ngc 3256 are excellent targets for such assessment because we can simultaneously study properties and driving mechanisms of two powerful molecular outflows of different natures .",
    "our observations have added two similarities between ngc 3256 and arp 220 in addition to both being late stage mergers with large infrared luminosities .",
    "one is the presence of outflows from both of the two merger nuclei ; for arp 220 blueshifted molecular line absorption indicative of outflow has been detected toward both nuclei @xcite .",
    "the other is that the two merger nuclei with less than 1 kpc projected separation still retain their nuclear gas disks with misaligned rotational axes ; for arp 220 this was first imaged by @xcite .",
    "our submillimeter observations also revealed a clear difference between the two mergers .",
    "namely , the nuclei of ngc 3256 are less obscured than the arp 220 nuclei in terms of gas and dust column density averaged at 100 pc scale .",
    "this is most clearly seen in the submillimeter continuum emission whose opacity due to dust is almost unity at 860 toward the nuclei of arp 220 but about two orders of magnitude lower toward the nuclei of ngc 3256 . in order for ngc 3256 to evolve into arp 220 ,",
    "therefore , significant gas accretion is needed to the nuclei despite the ongoing strong molecular outflows that would deplete the gas in the nuclei in myrs . such evolution may indeed occur because arp 220 is probably more advanced as a merger than ngc 3256 judging from their nuclear separations .",
    "ngc 3256 may become more luminous in that process , perhaps as luminous as arp 220 , because there is a statistical trend for larger nuclear obscuration ( i.e. , more gas funneling to the nuclei ) and larger total luminosities in more advanced mergers @xcite . further studies on ngc 3256 are warranted also for the purpose of tracing the late evolutionary path of a merger that is plausibly about to become ultraluminous .    finally we reemphasize our caution on  in particular for the high - velocity molecular outflows .",
    "the large line widths of the outflow gas reduce the co column density per line width and hence may well result in optically thin co emission . the conversion factor for that case",
    "is @xmath153 .",
    "such a low conversion factor for optically - thin co has been adopted , for example , for the molecular outflow in ngc 1266 on the basis of multi - line co excitation analysis @xcite .",
    "the outflows in ngc 3256 may have a similar situation and .",
    "alternatively , the outflowing gas may consist of an ensemble of optically - thick ( in co ) clouds that spread in a wide velocity range . in its partial support",
    "is our detection of cn(10 ) lines , with likely enhancement relative to co(10 ) , in the high - velocity gas (  [ s.result.line.hv.spectra ] ) .",
    "although cn may be subthermally excited , the detection of a line with a @xmath65  critical density implies gas clumping for dense gas to exist in the high velocity outflows .",
    "even if individual clumps are not virialized as assumed for the standard , the conversion factor for optically thick clumps will be larger than that for optically thin co ( and lower that that for virialized co - thick clouds ) .",
    "similar clumping and presence of dense gas in a galactic molecular outflow have been deduced for mrk 231 by @xcite from their detection of broad line wings in hcn , , and hnc lines . because most outflow parameters in table  [ t.4418measured.param ] depend on , followup studies on the physical and chemical properties of the high - velocity gas are highly desired .",
    "each of the two merger nuclei has its own nuclear disk where molecular line and continuum emission peak .",
    "the northern nuclear disk is nearly face - on ( @xmath154 30 ) , has a 200 pc characteristic radius , and clearly rotates around the northern nucleus .",
    "the southern nucleus has a more compact emission peak and a linear structure extending 200 pc on either side .",
    "it is deduced to be a nearly edge - on nuclear disk rotating around the southern nucleus .",
    "the mean molecular gas surface densities of both nuclei is about 3@xmath155 at 240 pc resolution , where @xmath156 is the co - to-  conversion factor in the unit of @xmath157 .",
    "the peak gas surface density is @xmath158  at the southern nucleus at 80 pc resolution .",
    "the high velocity molecular gas previously found at the center of the merger is resolved to two molecular outflows associated with the two nuclei .",
    "we detected not only co but also cn lines with enhancement in these outflows .",
    "the cn detection in a galactic outflow is for the first time to our knowledge .",
    "the total molecular outflow rate of the two outflows is on the same order of the total star formation rate in ngc 3256 .",
    "the molecular outflow from the northern nuclear disk is a bipolar flow with a wide opening angle and a nearly pole - on viewing angle .",
    "it has de - projected outflow velocities up to 750  at @xmath644@xmath66 and an outflow time scale ( crossing time ) of 1 myr .",
    "its molecular gas mass is @xmath159 , mass outflow rate @xmath160 , and kinetic luminosity on the order of @xmath161 .",
    "the last three are for the gas at de - projected velocities above 260 . at the current rate",
    "the outflow would deplete molecular gas in the northern nuclear disk in 3 myr if the same conversion factor applies to the nuclear disk and the outflow .",
    "most of the outflow / superwind signatures found so far at other wavelengths in ngc 3256 must be from this outflow .",
    "the molecular outflow from ngc 3256s is a well collimated bipolar jet with a @xmath162 opening angle and is nearly edge on .",
    "it has a de - projected maximum velocity 2600  for a favored inclination angle 80   or 1300  for @xmath163",
    ". the line - of - sight outflow velocity increases with distance up to 300 pc from the nucleus .",
    "this molecular jet has a 0.5 myr crossing time , a mass of @xmath164 , a mass outflow rate @xmath165 , and a kinetic luminosity on the order of @xmath166  for @xmath167 .",
    "these are for gas at projected velocities above 220  and the lower velocity gas in the outflow may be an order of magnitude larger in mass .",
    "the gas depletion time for the central 80 pc is 0.6 myr under the same assumption about the conversion factor as above and ignoring the lower velocity flow .",
    "the northern outflow is a starburst driven superwind in all likelihood .",
    "the southern outflow is most likely entrained by a radio jet from a weak or recently dimmed agn in the southern nucleus .",
    "pieces of evidence for the latter outflow driver are the large differences in the outflow parameters from the northern superwind , off - nuclear broad  lines in ngc 3256 , and a pair of radio spurs from the southern nucleus that matches in shape the southern molecular bipolar jet .",
    "continuum spectral indexes are negative at 3 mm and positive at 0.86 mm for both nuclei .",
    "the index is lower , in particular at 0.86 mm , for the southern nucleus , suggesting significant synchrotron and/or free - free emission even at 860 .",
    "neither nucleus has a bright ( @xmath168 k ) dust continuum core of several 10 pc size at 860   such as those found in arp 220 and ngc 4418 .",
    "this disfavors presence of a highly compton - thick and currently luminous agn in the nuclei of ngc 3256 .",

    "<S> we report alma and sma observations of the luminous infrared merger ngc 3256 , the most luminous galaxy within @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> our data show that both of the two merger nuclei separated by 5  ( 0.8 kpc ) on the sky have a compact concentration of molecular gas . </S>",
    "<S> we identify them as nuclear disks with molecular gas surface densities over @xmath1   and determine that while one at the northern nucleus is nearly face - on the other at the southern nucleus is almost edge - on . </S>",
    "<S> the northern nucleus is more massive and has molecular arcs and spiral arms around . </S>",
    "<S> the high - velocity molecular gas previously found in the system is resolved to two components . </S>",
    "<S> they are two molecular outflows associated with each of the two nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the molecular outflow from the northern nuclear disk is part of a starburst - driven superwind seen nearly pole on . </S>",
    "<S> it has a maximum velocity greater than 750  and its mass outflow rate is estimated to be @xmath2 for a conversion factor @xmath3 of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the outflow from the southern nucleus is a highly collimated bipolar molecular jet seen nearly edge - on . </S>",
    "<S> its line - of - sight velocity increases with distance out to 300 pc from the southern nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum de - projected velocity is on the order of 2000  for the estimated inclination and should exceed 1000  even allowing for its uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> the mass outflow rate is estimated to be @xmath5  for this outflow . </S>",
    "<S> there are possible signs that this southern outflow has been driven by a bipolar radio jet from an agn that became inactive very recently . </S>",
    "<S> the sum of these outflow rates , although subject to the uncertainty in the molecular mass estimate , either exceeds or compares to the total star formation rate in ngc 3256 . </S>",
    "<S> the feedback from nuclear activities in the form of molecular outflows is therefore significant in the gas consumption budget , and hence evolution , of this luminous infrared galaxy . </S>"
