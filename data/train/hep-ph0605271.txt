    "the observation of wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) has successfully determined the cosmological parameters and nature of density fluctuations with high precision .",
    "the wmap result is quite consistent with the prediction of the inflationary cosmology , _",
    "i.e. _ , the flat universe with almost scale - invariant adiabatic density fluctuation . if one take a closer look at the shape of the power spectrum of the density fluctuations obtained by wmap , however , small deviation from scale invariance is found .",
    "in fact , the wmap 1st year result suggested that the data fits to the power spectrum with running spectral index @xmath1  @xcite , although the statistical significance was not high enough @xcite .",
    "there has been a renewed interest in the running spectral index because it is favored by the recently published three year wmap result  @xcite which gives @xmath2 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , no evidence of running was found from the combining analysis of the 1st year wmap and the improved data of ly-@xmath3 forests .",
    "however , as mentioned in  @xcite , the three year wmap result is not in good agreement with this ly-@xmath3 data .",
    "then , it seems premature to adopt the power spectrum obtained from ly-@xmath3 forests .",
    "therefore it is worth studying the inflation model which provides the running spectral index .",
    "it is not an easy task to build an inflation model which produces density perturbations whose power spectrum has a running index @xcite . after the release of the 1st year wmap data , the double inflation models ( hybrid+new  @xcite , smooth hybrid+new  @xcite ) were proposed",
    "however , since the power spectrum was obtained by analytical method in those works , the precise form of the spectrum on scales corresponding to transition from one inflation to another was not clear , which makes it difficult to compare the theoretical prediction with observations .    in this paper , therefore , we consider a double inflation model and calculate the power spectrum by numerical integration of evolution equations for density fluctuations .",
    "we adopt the smooth hybrid + new inflation  @xcite as a double inflation model .",
    "the model consists of smooth hybrid inflation  @xcite and new inflation  @xcite , both of which are based on supergravity .",
    "the running index is realized by the smooth hybrid inflation .",
    "the new inflation is necessary because the hybrid inflation with a large running index only has small @xmath4-folds @xmath5 and the remaining @xmath4-folds for successful inflation are provided by the new inflation .",
    "we show that the model can give an appropriate power spectrum which are consistent with wmap result .",
    "moreover , we find that large density fluctuations are produced through parametric resonance  @xcite of the inflaton fields at the transition epoch , which leads to a sharp peak on small scales in the spectrum and formation of primordial black holes ( pbhs ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec.ii , we introduce the smooth hybrid new inflation .",
    "the results of our numerical calculation on the power spectrum of the density perturbation are shown in sec.iii . in sec.iv",
    ", we investigate the parametric resonance in this inflationary model which results in a sharp peak found in sec.iii . in sec.v ,",
    "pbh formation is discussed as a consequence of a resonant peak .",
    "sec.vi is devoted to a discussion .    in this paper , we set the reduced planck scale @xmath6 to be unity unless otherwise stated .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the smooth hybrid new inflation model @xcite , which is based on supergravity .",
    "its superpotential is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) is the superpotential responsible for smooth hybrid ( new ) inflation .",
    "@xmath8 is written as @xmath10 here , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are a conjugate pair of superfields transforming as nontrivial representations of some gauge group @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 is a superfield whose scalar component is the inflaton and transforms as a singlet under @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , @xmath8 has two symmetries : one is an @xmath15-symmetry under which @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and the other is a discrete @xmath18 symmetry under which the combination @xmath19 has unit charge . @xmath20 sets a cutoff scale which controls nonrenormalizable terms in @xmath8 .",
    "we include possible coupling constants in the definition of @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 sets the scale of the smooth hybrid inflation .",
    "the superpotential @xmath9 is given by @xmath22 @xmath23 is the inflaton superfield for the new inflation and has a discrete @xmath15-symmetry , @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "@xmath25 , which satisfies @xmath26 , is the scale of the new inflation , and @xmath27 is a coupling constant of nonrenormalizable terms in @xmath9 .",
    "the khler potential is given by @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a constant smaller than unity .",
    "first , we make the assumption that initially @xmath37 is sufficiently large though @xmath38 is satisfied , and that @xmath39 and @xmath40 are set around local minimum .",
    "indeed , if @xmath37 is sufficiently large , @xmath39 and @xmath40 have effective masses larger than the hubble parameter @xmath41 , so that they roll down to their respective minima quickly .",
    "thus , the effective potential of @xmath0 determines not only the dynamics of the smooth hybrid inflation but also primordial density fluctuations generated during the smooth hybrid inflation @xcite . retaining only relevant terms ,",
    "it is given by @xmath42 hereafter , we consider only the case with @xmath43 . as long as @xmath44 , the effective potential is dominated by the false vacuum energy @xmath45 , and hence inflation takes place .",
    "the hubble parameter @xmath41 is almost constant @xmath46 . the second term of eq.([effective_vh ] ) , which originates from nonrenormalizable term of superpotential , has a negative curvature . on the other hand , the third term of eq.([effective_vh ] ) , which comes from supergravity correction , has a positive curvature .",
    "then , for modes crossing the horizon while the third term dominates the dynamics , the spectrum of curvature perturbation has a spectral index @xmath47 . in opposition , for modes crossing the horizon while the second term dominates , the spectrum of curvature perturbation has a spectral index @xmath48 . in this way , this smooth hybrid inflation model can generate the spectrum with the running spectral index suggested by wmap results .",
    "we estimate the amplitude of curvature perturbation @xmath49 , spectral index @xmath1 and its running @xmath50 , up to second order of slow - roll parameters ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) . according to wmap three year result",
    ", these cosmological parameters are constrained by @xmath51 at 1@xmath0 level , where @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "we can determine the parameters requiring that the spectrum satisfies these constraints .",
    "however , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the number of @xmath4-foldings @xmath53 after the mode with @xmath52 $ ] crosses the horizon is estimated to be @xmath54 .",
    "this is too small to solve the horizon and the flatness problems , and hence the second inflation is needed .",
    "in addition , we must require that @xmath53 is sufficiently large : @xmath55 , for , as we will see later , the perturbations produced by the second inflation has a very large amplitude .",
    "the scale of those perturbations should be sufficiently small , say @xmath56 $ ] , in order not to conflict with observations .",
    "it is difficult to meet this request while reproducing the best - fit values of wmap three year result , because the latter requires large running .",
    "if we allow 1@xmath0 range of wmap three year constraint , we can reproduce such a spectrum .",
    "we choose the following parameters : @xmath57 this reproduces best - fit values of @xmath49 and @xmath1 , but @xmath50 within the @xmath58 range .",

    "we can estimate the amplitude of the long - period oscillation of @xmath142 , in terms of the power spectrum for @xmath127 $ ] , @xmath229 hereafter , we will concentrate on amplitudes @xmath230 and @xmath231 of the oscillations of @xmath140 and @xmath142 , respectively .",
    "we approximated that the @xmath214 term gives the same contribution as that of @xmath213 term .",
    "the numerical calculation gives @xmath232 .",
    "our estimation is very rough , but gives the same order of the result of numerical calculation .    at the time",
    "the long - period oscillation ceases , this estimation underestimates the amplitude @xmath233 . at @xmath234 and @xmath235 ,",
    "the long - period oscillation ceases , with @xmath236 and @xmath237 .",
    "these give @xmath238 , while the numerical result is @xmath239 .",
    "this is because of the complexity of the evolution : since @xmath240 , the evolution is in the transition regime between subhorizon to superhorizon , and hence the evolution of @xmath241 marginally freezes .    on the other hand",
    ", we can verify that @xmath142 at the horizon crossing determines the curvature perturbation . at the horizon",
    "crossing , numerical calculation gives @xmath242 . at that time , @xmath243 and @xmath244 .",
    "we can get @xmath245 this gives @xmath246 at the peak , which is the same order of the result of numerical calculation @xmath247 .",
    "the presence of the large sharp peak around @xmath248 $ ] may lead to interesting consequences , one of which is the formation of primordial black holes . from the peak position",
    "@xmath127 $ ] of the spectrum shown in fig.[fig : spectrum]-(a ) , the mean mass of resultant pbhs is estimated as @xmath249 here we assume that the whole mass within the overdense region when it enters the horizon collapses into a black hole .",
    "the abundance of such a massive pbh is constrained by assuming that they must not overclose the universe @xcite . in this case ,",
    "initial mass fraction @xmath250 is constrained to be @xmath251 .",
    "we estimate the black hole abundance , following @xcite based on numerical simulation of pbh formation from an overdense region @xcite .    assuming a spherically symmetric overdense region ,",
    "two conditions must be satisfied for the formation of pbhs from the overdense region .",
    "first , the overdense region must have larger density than a critical value . under the linear approximation , this is given by curvature perturbation at the horizon crossing @xmath252 as @xmath253 the other independent condition is given by @xmath254 where @xmath255 at the horizon crossing .",
    "the latter condition requires that the excess mass around the overdense regin is sufficiently large . the initial mass fraction @xmath250 of pbhs",
    "can be identified with the probability @xmath256 .",
    "assuming that the density perturbation has a gaussian probability distribution , the probability @xmath257 is given by @xmath258 where @xmath259 is the variance of @xmath49 at the horizon crossing .",
    "for the spectrum shown in fig.[fig : spectrum]-(a ) , we can get @xmath260 , which results in @xmath261 .",
    "on the other hand , under the presence of a peak with @xmath262 , the conditional probability of @xmath263 is found to be 0.5 .",
    "consequently , the initial mass fraction of pbhs is estimated to be @xmath264 this is far larger than the constraint @xmath251 .",
    "if we introduce larger decay rates of inflaton fields @xmath0 and @xmath39 , resultant pbh abundance can be acceptably small . the spectrum shown in fig.[fig : spectrum]-(b )",
    "gives @xmath265 , which is below the bound @xmath251 .",
    "we have reexamined the smooth hybrid new inflation model , which was designed to reproduce the running spectral index suggested by the wmap three year result , by numerical calculation of the perturbation .",
    "we have confirmed that this model can reproduce the spectrum within 1@xmath0 range of the wmap three year result .",
    "in addition , we find strong peaks on smaller scales , which originate from the amplification of perturbation @xmath266 and @xmath267 by parametric resonance .",
    "since there are interactions between @xmath75 and @xmath40 , this amplified perturbation is transfered to @xmath266 .",
    "@xmath266 begins large - amplitude and long - period oscillation , and freezes out at the horizon crossing , determining the primordial curvature perturbation .",
    "the resultant curvature perturbation depends on the phase of oscillating @xmath266 , so that the resonant peak consists of several steep peaks and valleys .",
    "the strength of the resultant peak can be controlled by the decay rate of the first inflaton , and the comoving scale of the peak can be controlled by the scale factor at the beginning of oscillatory phase .",
    "such a peak in the spectrum of primordial curvature perturbation can be a source of pbhs . due to the strong peak , mass of generated pbhs",
    "can be estimated by the horizon mass at the horizon crossing of the scale which corresponds to the resonant peak .",
