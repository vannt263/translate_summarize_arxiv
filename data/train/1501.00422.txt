    "low dimensional interacting spin systems have long been a laboratory for the discovery of novel quantum states of matter . enhanced quantum fluctuations due to reduced dimensionality",
    "enable the appearance of multiple quantum phases with unique characteristics  driven by the interplay between strong interactions , external ( e.g. , pressure and magnetic field ) and internal ( e.g. , crystal field effects ) potentials and lattice geometry  that are suppressed in higher dimensions . the relative simplicity of the microscopic models facilitates the development of exact analytical solutions in many cases and powerful field theoretic and computational approaches in others  providing greater insight into the emergence of these complex phases and their physical properties .",
    "concurrent rapid advances in the synthesis and characterization of low - dimensional quantum magnets have kept the study of these systems one of the most active frontiers in condensed matter physics ( see landee and turnbull@xcite for a recent pedagogical review ) .",
    "one of the most remarkable results in the study of quantum spin models  one that substantially enhanced our understanding of long range order in quantum many body systems  is the pioneering work by haldane.@xcite by studying the non - linear sigma model in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions , haldane conjectured that the ground state of the one - dimensional ( 1d ) heisenberg antiferromagnet ( hafm ) has gapless excitations for half - odd integer spins , whereas that for integer spins is separated from all excited states by a finite spin gap ( haldane gap ) .",
    "haldane s conjecture has inspired numerous theoretical studies of integer spins in low dimensions , primarily @xmath0 spins where the haldane phase is most robust .",
    "these include chain mean field theory ( cmft),@xcite exact diagonalization,@xcite density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg),@xcite and quantum monte carlo  ( qmc ) simulations.@xcite    the theoretical studies have been complemented by the discovery of several quasi - one - dimensional ( q1d ) spin @xmath0 quantum magnets , such as agvp@xmath1s@xmath2@xcite ndmap,@xcite nenb,@xcite nenp,@xcite nino,@xcite pbni@xmath1v@xmath1o@xmath3,@xcite srni@xmath1v@xmath1o@xmath3,@xcite tmnin,@xcite and y@xmath1banio@xmath4.@xcite in these materials , the magnetic ions are arranged in chains , with weak but finite inter - chain couplings , which affect the ground state phases .",
    "additionally , in most known @xmath0 magnets , the ubiquitous heisenberg exchange is complemented by a single - ion anisotropy .",
    "the expanded hilbert space of the @xmath0 spins , and the interplay between multiple competing interactions , external magnetic field and different lattice geometries result in a rich variety of ground state phases .",
    "in addition to the gapped haldane phase , examples of exotic quantum states realized in low dimensional interacting spin systems include experimentally realized bose einstein condensation  ( bec ) of magnons,@xcite quantum paramagnet,@xcite and the recently proposed spin supersolid@xcite and ferronematic@xcite phases .",
    "recent advances in synthesis techniques have made it possible to engineer quasi - low - dimensional materials where the `` effective dimensionality '' ( that is , inter - chain or inter - layer couplings ) and hamiltonian parameters ( such as the ratio of exchange interaction and single - ion anisotropy ) can be controlled.@xcite this raises the possibility of preparing materials with desired predetermined properties .",
    "the search for such tailor - made materials has grown in recent years , as these are believed to drive the next generation of electronics .",
    "in addition to condensed matter systems , rapid advances in the field of ultracold atoms in optical lattices have opened up a new frontier in the study of interacting many - body systems in arbitrary dimensions . the unprecedented control over number of atoms , interactions , and lattice geometry makes it an ideal testbed for preparing and studying novel quantum states .",
    "the most remarkable property of the haldane phase is that even though there is no long - range magnetic order  all spin - spin correlations decay exponentially  there exists a hidden or nonlocal order measured by the string order parameter introduced by den nijs and rommelse@xcite .",
    "the introduction of a nonlocal order parameter was a marked departure from the conventional practice of characterizing quantum many body states in terms of local order parameters and ushered in the study of topological phases  an area of intense current research .",
    "much insight into the nature of the haldane phase can be gained from the aklt ( affleck - kennedy - lieb - tasaki ) state  the exact ground state of a 1d @xmath0 spin chain where the near - neighbor heisenberg interaction is supplemented by an additional interaction between neighboring spins.@xcite the aklt state may be understood by noting that the spin at each site can be thought of as a symmetric combination of two @xmath5 spins .",
    "pairs of these spins on neighboring sites form a singlet on each bond . for a periodic chain",
    ", this forms a unique valence bond solid ground state  a singlet on each bond  with a gap to lowest excitations .",
    "but for open chains , there remains an unpaired @xmath5 moment at each end which is doubly degenerate ( see fig .",
    "[ aklt ] for an illustration of this state ) .",
    "consequently , the ground state is gapped in the `` bulk '' and has degenerate gapless edge states .",
    "the state is protected by this @xmath6 symmetry .",
    "using the current terminology of topological states , this state is a symmetry protected topological ( spt ) phase .",
    "the haldane phase is adiabatically connected to the aklt state  in other words , it has the same qualitative character .",
    "in fact , the haldane phase is widely recognized as the earliest and best understood spt phase in interacting many body systems.@xcite     degrees of freedom composed of the symmetric combination of two spin @xmath5 spins ( small solid circles ) . in the aklt state ,",
    "pairs of @xmath5 spins on neighboring sites form a singlet state ( blue lines ) . for open boundaries",
    ", this leaves an unpaired @xmath5 degree of freedom at each boundary . in the thermodynamic limit , these spins are completely decoupled from the rest of the lattice , leading to a fourfold degenerate ground state . ]",
    "what happens to the haldane phase in the presence of additional interactions , such as , inter - chain coupling and single - ion anisotropy ?",
    "the question is not simply of academic interest  all real materials have nonzero interchain coupling and in many quantum magnets , the crystal electric field lifts the degeneracy of the local hilbert space in the form of a single - ion anisotropy .",
    "theoretical studies have shown that both these interactions destroy the haldane phase at sufficiently strong interaction strengths  the single - ion anisotropy drives a transition to a quantum paramagnetic phase whereas interchain coupling favors long - range afm ordering  but the ground state remains gapped up to finite values of the couplings .",
    "what is the nature of the gapped ground state away from the isotropic heisenberg point ?",
    "does it still retain its spt character ?",
    "the string order parameter  the only definitive probe for the haldane phase  is strictly defined only in one dimension and its extension to coupled chains can not be trusted without corroboration from additional measurements .",
    "fortunately , recent advancements in the study of spt phases have yielded new probes that provide better insight into the nature of the putative haldane phase away from the isotropic heisenberg point . in this brief review ,",
    "we summarize some of our recent progress towards fully characterizing the haldane phase in quasi - one - dimensional geometries .",
    "we consider a model of low dimensional quantum magnets consisting of an array of weakly coupled spin-1 hafm chains .",
    "this model can be described by a spatially anisotropic hamiltonian of @xmath0 spin operators with nearest - neighbor spin exchange interactions and on - site single - ion anisotropy : @xmath7}{\\vec s}_{i}\\cdot{\\vec s}_{j}+d\\sum_{i}\\left(s_{i}^{z}\\right)^{2}.\\ ] ] the first two sums are over all pairs of interacting spins @xmath8 , with @xmath9 and @xmath10 $ ] referring to nearest neighbor spin pairs along and perpendicular to the chain direction , respectively , while the third sum is over all lattice sites @xmath11 . here ,",
    "we limit ourselves to nearest neighbor interactions on bipartite lattices to avoid the sign problem in qmc , and tune the interactions @xmath12 and @xmath13 to generate systems of weakly interacting spin chains .",

    ", we consider several bipartite lattices in the quasi - one - dimensional limit . for each lattice",

    "the ratio of these two length scales forms the aspect ratio @xmath18 , which we set at @xmath19 unless otherwise stated .",
    "we henceforth set the intrachain interaction strength to unity ( @xmath20 ) , and study the ground state properties of the above model for various single - ion anisotropy @xmath21 and interchain coupling @xmath13 .",

    "quantum monte carlo methods map quantum systems onto equivalent classical representations in @xmath22 dimensions , where the configuration space can be stochastically sampled by markov chain monte carlo methods.@xcite the numerical results presented here were obtained using the stochastic series expansion ( sse ) formulation of qmc.@xcite briefly , the density matrix can be expanded as a taylor series , @xmath23 . for a spin hamiltonian consisting of onsite fields and pair interactions ,",
    "we can write @xmath24 , where the sum is over all pair interactions , or _ bonds_. the powers of @xmath25 appearing in the taylor expansion of @xmath26 can then be written as a sum over products of bond operators , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 represents a sequence of bond operators called the _ operator string_. note that the overall sign of a particular operator string depends on the number of bond operators with negative weight . to avoid the sign problem in qmc",
    ", all the bond operators must therefore be positive definite , which in practice limits the study of heisenberg antiferromagnets to bipartite lattices , where a suitable sublattice rotation is available .",
    "the configuration space consists of all possible rearrangements of the operator string , the length of which takes into account the expansion variable @xmath29 , while its sequence dictates the states @xmath30 appearing in the partition function , @xmath31 .",
    "loop algorithms exist to efficiently sample this configuration space.@xcite    in addition to the sse method , we implement a projective qmc method that allows us to access both ground state expectation values as well as wave function overlaps between the ground state and a trivial product state .",

    "here we present recent qmc results on the ground state properties of the spin @xmath0 hafm described by the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) .",
    "first , we show how finite size scaling can be used to accurately determine the ground state phase boundaries between the haldane phase and neighboring magnetically ordered phases .",
    "next , we examine the effect of lattice geometry on the critical coupling of bipartite lattices .",
    "the phase diagram is then presented in the quasi - one - dimensional regime using a spatially anisotropic rectilinear lattice .",
    "this phase diagram is directly compared to the experimentally determined parameters of haldane gap materials .",
    "we also show the magnetization curves of the q1d model for the various zero - field ground state phases , and calculate the low - lying excitation spectrum of the haldane phase near the haldane gap minimum .",
    "finally , the haldane phase in q1d geometries is shown to belong to the new class of symmetry protected topological states .",
    "even with a simulation method such as sign - free quantum monte carlo that scales polynomially in system size , it is impossible to directly access results for macroscopic system sizes . to overcome this difficulty",
    ", we employ finite - size scaling ( fss ) methods to extrapolate our results to the ground state thermodynamic limit .",
    "since quantum systems map onto classical systems in @xmath32 dimensions , where @xmath33 is the dynamic critical exponent , similar procedures can be used to access the @xmath34 and @xmath35 limits . for ground states that break a continuous spin symmetry ,",
    "the spin stiffness is a useful observable to determine the boundary of such a gapless phase ( as per the goldstone theorem ) with a gapped state of any order .",
    "this is because the spin stiffness must be finite in the gapless phase and zero in the gapped phase .",

    "due to the shortcomings of the string order parameter in more than one spatial dimension , it would be nice to find alternative ways to characterize the haldane phase in q1d geometries .",
    "since the haldane state in 1d is a nontrivial spt state , we might expect it to remain such in q1d systems .",
    "still , direct evidence for this has been lacking .",
    "this may have to do with the difficulty of characterizing spt states in general .",
    "one common method is to look at the low lying entanglement spectrum,@xcite where an overall degeneracy signals a nontrivial spt state.@xcite while the entanglement spectrum can be easily accessed using powerful dmrg techniques in 1d , systems in higher dimension pose a tougher challenge . additionally , there is the possibility that the `` cut '' used to form a bipartition of the system during the construction of the reduced density matrix may break an off - site symmetry , and so misdiagnose spt phases protected by such symmetries .",
    "fortunately , in 1d and 2d there exists an alternative way to distinguish between trivial and nontrivial spt states .",
    "this is the so - called strange correlator of you _",
    "et al._,@xcite which uses a mapping between the space - time correlations at the spatial boundary of a nontrivial spt state with a trivial spt state ( or vacuum ) and ( through a laplace transform ) the spatial correlations at the temporal boundary between the time - evolved quantum field theories of the respective trivial and nontrivial spt states .",
    "since the space - time correlations at the aforementioned spatial boundary are known to possess long - range ( or , possibly quasi - long - range ) order in one and two dimensions,@xcite a long - range or quasi - long - range strange correlator is then a direct measure of spt order in 1d and 2d , while short - range behavior is a sign of a trivial product state . in 3d",
    ", the possibility of a topologically ordered edge state allows for the construction of nontrivial spt phases with short - range strange correlators ; however , long - range or quasi - long - range behavior remains indicative of spt order .",
    "the strange correlator is calculated as a `` mixed '' correlation function between the nontrivial spt state @xmath139 and the trivial spt state @xmath140 , @xmath141 in practice , @xmath140 is taken as a symmetric product state , which is by definition a trivial spt state .",
    "the state @xmath139 can be our putative spt state in question , and thus a ( quasi- ) long - range strange correlator becomes a direct probe of the nontrivial spt character of the state @xmath139 .",
    "it should also be mentioned that this only applies to states that are gapped and symmetric , i.e. they are either trivial or nontrivial spt states to begin with . for the case considered here",
    ", there is a host of evidence that the q1d haldane phase is just such a state .",

    "the identification of the quasi - one - dimensional haldane phase as a nontrivial spt state in its own right naturally leads us to consider what sort of topological edge modes might be present in this system .",
    "although these edge states are yet to be directly determined using numerical methods , there exists a solid theoretical framework from which we can speculate on their nature .",
    "first , consider that the haldane phase in 1d supports degenerate spin-1/2 edge states .",
    "next , if we couple haldane chains into an @xmath147-leg ladder , the edge states will form an overall singlet for @xmath147 even , but retain a degeneracy for @xmath147 odd due to kramers theorem .",
    "this explains why even leg ladders form trivial spt states , while odd leg ladders form non - trivial spt states .",
    "what happens to the edge states as @xmath148 ?",
    "for infinitesimal interchain couplings , they must be none other than the spin-1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain , with a gapless linear dispersion near the antiferromagnetic ordering wave vector . similarly , the edge states of a three - dimensional q1d haldane phase correspond to the ground state of the spin-1/2 heisenberg square lattice antiferromagnet , which is likewise gapless .",
    "it is natural to assume the edge state spectrum will not significantly alter as @xmath13 is increased while remaining in the quasi - one - dimensional haldane phase .",
    "further , as long as the protecting symmetry of space inversion about chain bonds remains intact , these edge states are robust to any symmetry conserving perturbations .",
    "the question then becomes : how can we measure these directly , both in simulation as well as in experiment ?",
    "in this context , we mention that a method has recently been proposed for the experimental probe of fractional edge states in @xmath0 heisenberg chains.@xcite    string order has been predicted to decay exponentially , with correlation length @xmath149 , for any finite coupling @xmath13 between chains.@xcite if this is the case , we might expect essentially 1d behavior when the length of individual chains @xmath150 . since spin-1/2 edge states have been observed in doped haldane chain compounds using non - magnetic dopant ions ( which break the spin chains into finite segments ) , we may surmise that the finite segments @xmath151 in such systems obey the relation @xmath152 , where we use the expectation value to reflect the distribution of @xmath151 values due to random placing of the dopant ions ( for a doping concentration @xmath153 , we expect @xmath154 ) . in a system such as y@xmath1banio@xmath4 where the interchain coupling is very small ( @xmath155),@xcite the resulting correlation length is so large ( @xmath156 ) that almost any finite doping @xmath153 is sufficient to guarantee that @xmath152 .",
    "indeed , spin-1/2 edge states are observed in the system y@xmath1bani@xmath157mg@xmath158o@xmath4 with @xmath159 and @xmath160.@xcite however , it is interesting to speculate what might occur in haldane materials with relatively strong @xmath13 , such as pbni@xmath1v@xmath1o@xmath3 and srni@xmath1v@xmath1o@xmath3 : might there exists a critical doping @xmath161 , below which @xmath162 ?",
    "if so , are spin-1/2 edge states still detectable ?",
    "one exciting possible use of the symmetry protected edge states in haldane chains is for measurement - based quantum computation ( mbqc).@xcite in this quantum computing scheme , an entangled state is initially prepared , after which single qubit measurements are performed .",
    "these measurements destroy the resource state , so this method is also referred to as _ one - way _ quantum computing .",
    "the aklt state , and haldane ground states in general , have been shown to be a possible resource state for mbqc.@xcite however , in order to achieve universal quantum computation , a two dimensional resource state is required . in this fashion ,",
    "the spin-3/2 aklt state on the honeycomb lattice has been proposed as a universal resource for mbqc.@xcite it is interesting to speculate that any vbs state with protected edge modes in two dimensions might prove to be a universal resource state for mbqc , in which case the haldane phase of spin-1 heisenberg chains weakly coupled into a two dimensional array ( as in fig .  [ lattice ] ) might be a way to achieve such a state .",
    "this would be very useful since aklt states of higher spins require additional hamiltonian terms beyond the bilinear and biquadratic ones needed for spin-1 .",
    "spin-1 chains also have the distinction that the aklt state is adiabatically connected to the haldane phase at the heisenberg point ( i.e. as the biquadratic term is tuned to zero , the vbs state remains intact ) . in higher dimensions",
    ", the heisenberg ground state tends towards nel order , which is the case on honeycomb and square lattices .",
    "the remarkable properties of the haldane phase in spin-1 heisenberg antiferromagnets have spurred continued interest in haldane gap materials and their low - energy effective spin models . yet",
    "surprisingly , no accurate determination of the phase diagram for these models in experimentally relevant geometries has been completed until recently . here , we have presented some of our recent work on these systems , including an accurate phase diagram for a square superlattice of weakly interacting heisenberg antiferromagnetic spin chains .",
    "further , we have shown the magnetization and differential susceptibility curves for longitudinal magnetic fields , and calculated the low - lying dispersion along the @xmath163 plane in reciprocal space .",
    "we have also presented direct evidence for the symmetry protected topological character of the haldane phase in quasi - one - dimensional geometries .",
    "this includes extended string correlations along the weakly coupled chains , as well as a direct characterization through the long - range behavior of the strange correlator .",
    "these calculations lead to a picture of the quasi - one - dimensional haldane phase as a symmetry protected topological phase with an effective gapless spin-1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnetic state at its surface .    in this brief review ,",
    "we have endeavored to introduce the haldane phase within the current classification of short - range entangled symmetric states of matter  namely , the symmetry protected topological states .",
    "this exciting development is stimulating renewed interest in this field . at the same time , recent developments in the growth and chemical synthesis of molecule - based magnets allow for greater control over the microscopic properties of magnetic materials .",
    "the convergence of these two lines of inquiry will be a promising direction for future research .",
    "in particular , the experimental identification of edge states at the surface of a quantum antiferromagnet would potentially realize the first known example of a bosonic spt state .",
    "such a state could have potential uses in measurement - based quantum computing .",

    "<S> we review the basic properties of the haldane phase in spin-1 heisenberg antiferromagnetic chains , including its persistence in quasi - one - dimensional geometries . using large - scale numerical simulations , we map out the phase diagram for a realistic model applicable to experimental haldane compounds . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the effect of different chain coupling geometries and confirm a general mean field universality of the critical coupling times the coordination number of the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> inspired by the recent development of characterization of symmetry protected topological states , of which the haldane phase of spin-1 heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain is a preeminent example , we provide direct evidence that the quasi - one - dimensional haldane phase is indeed a non - trivial symmetry protected topological state . </S>"
