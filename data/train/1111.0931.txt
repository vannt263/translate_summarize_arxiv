    "in the well - known theory of period polynomials one constructs a vector space of polynomials associated with a vector space of modular forms .",
    "the hecke operators act on each space and have the same eigenvalues .",
    "thus , either vector space produces the usual degree 2 l - series associated with holomorphic modular forms . in 2001",
    "lewis and zagier extended this theory and defined spaces of period functions associated to non - holomorphic modular forms , i.e. to maass forms and real analytic eisenstein series .",
    "period functions are real analytic functions @xmath2 which satisfy three term relations @xmath3 where @xmath4 . the period functions for maass forms are characterized by ( [ eqn : three ] ) together with the growth conditions @xmath5 as @xmath6 and @xmath7 as @xmath8 ; for these @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the eigenvalue of the laplacian associated with a maass form . for eisenstein series , the @xmath11 s in the above growth conditions are replaced by @xmath12 s if @xmath13 and by @xmath14 and @xmath15 if @xmath16 .",
    "they show that @xmath17 , which is initially defined only in the upper half plane , actually has an analytic continuation to all of @xmath18 apart from the negative real axis .    to each period function",
    "is also associated a periodic and holomorphic function @xmath19 on the upper half plane , @xmath20    in this paper we focus on the case of real analytic eisenstein series . for these",
    ", the periodic function @xmath19 turns out to be essentially @xmath21 where , as usual , @xmath22 indicates the sum of the @xmath23-th power of the divisors of @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we interpret lewis and zagier s results directly in terms of this function , obtaining a better understanding of the taylor series of the associated period function .",
    "it turns out that the case @xmath26 , i.e. @xmath16 is especially useful . in this case",
    "the arithmetic part of the @xmath24-th fourier coefficient is @xmath27 , the number of divisors of @xmath24 .",
    "there are several nice applications that are consequences of the analytic continuation of the associated period function , i.e. they are consequences of the surprising fact that the function @xmath28 which apparently only makes sense when the imaginary part of @xmath29 is positive , actually has an analytic continuation to @xmath30 the split complex plane ( the complex with the negative real axis removed ) .",
    "first , we obtain a new formula for the weighted mean square of the riemann zeta - function on the critical line : @xmath31 previously , the best formula for this quantity was a main term plus an asymptotic , but not convergent , series of powers of @xmath32 , each term an order of magnitude better than the previous as @xmath33 .",
    "our formula gives an asymptotic series which is also convergent .",
    "the situation is somewhat analogous to the situation of the partition function @xmath34 .",
    "hardy and ramanujan found an asymptotic series for @xmath34 and subsequently rademacher gave a series which was both asymptotic and convergent . in both the partition case and our case , the exact formula allows for the computation of the sought quantity to _ any _ desired degree of precision , whereas an asymptotic series has limits to its precision .",
    "of course , an extra feature of @xmath34 , that is not present in our situation , is that since @xmath34 is an integer it is known exactly once it is known to a precision of @xmath35 .",
    "however , our formula does have the extra surprising feature that the time required to calculate our desired mean square is basically independent of @xmath32 , apart from the intrinsic difficulty of the extra work required just to write down a high precision number @xmath32 .",
    "a second application proves a surprising reciprocity formula for the vasyunin sum , which is a cotangent sum that appears in the nyman - beurling criterion for the riemann hypothesis .",
    "specifically , the vasyunin sum appears as part of the exact formula for the twisted mean - square of the riemann zeta - function on the critical line : @xmath36 the fact that there is a reciprocity formula for the vasyunin sum is a non - obvious symmetry relating this integral for @xmath37 and the integral for @xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "it is not apparent from this integral that there should be such a relationship ; our formula reveals a hidden structure .",
    "the reciprocity formula is most simply stated in terms of the function @xmath40 defined initially for non - zero rational numbers @xmath37 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are integers with @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the reciprocity formula can be simply stated as , `` the function @xmath45 extends from its initial definition on rationals @xmath46 to an ( explicit ) analytic function on the complex plane with the negative real axis deleted . ''",
    "this is nearly an example of what zagier calls a `` quantum modular form . ''",
    "we proved this reciprocity formula in  @xcite ; in this paper , we generalize it to a family of `` cotangent sums '' , containing both @xmath47 and the dedekind sum .",
    "these ( imperfect ) quantum modular forms are analogous to the `` quantum maass forms '' studied by bruggeman in  @xcite , the former being associated to eisenstein series and the latter to maass forms .",
    "the main difference between these two classes of quantum forms comes from the fact that the @xmath48-functions associated to maass forms are entire , while for eisenstein series the associated @xmath48-functions are not , since they are products of two shifted riemann zeta functions .",
    "this translates into quantum maass forms being quantum modular forms in the strict sense , whereas the reciprocity formulas for the cotangent sums contain a non - smooth correction term .    as a third application",
    ", we give a generalization of the classical voronoi summation formula , which is a formula for @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a smooth rapidly decaying function . the usual formula proceeds from @xmath51 where @xmath52 one obtains the formula by moving the path of integration to the left to @xmath53 , say , and then using the functional equation @xmath54 of @xmath55 . here , as usual , @xmath56 in this way one obtains a leading term @xmath57 from the pole of @xmath55 at @xmath58 , plus another term @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a kind of fourier - bessel transform of @xmath19 ; specifically , @xmath61 with @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the usual bessel functions . by contrast , the period relation implies , for example , that for @xmath65 and @xmath66 @xmath67 where @xmath68 . this is a useful formula which can not be readily extracted from the voronoi formula .",
    "in fact , the voronoi formula is actually an easy consequence of the formula . in section",
    "[ vf ] we give some other applications of this extended voronoi s formula .",
    "the theory and applications described above are for the period function associated with the eisenstein series with @xmath26 .",
    "in this paper we work in a slightly more general setting with @xmath69 , an arbitrary complex number .",
    "the circle of ideas presented here have other applications and further generalizations , for example to exact formulae for averages of dirichlet l - functions , which will be explored in future work .",
    "for @xmath70 and @xmath71 , consider @xmath72 for @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 is essentially the eisenstein series of weight @xmath76 , @xmath77 for which the well known modularity property @xmath78 holds when @xmath79 . for other values of @xmath23",

    "here and throughout the paper equalities are to be interpreted as identities between meromorphic functions in @xmath23 .",

    "for ease of reference , note that   can be rewritten in terms of @xmath90 and @xmath91 as @xmath92    another important feature of the function @xmath93 comes from the properties of its taylor series .",
    "for example , in the case @xmath94 one has @xmath95 with @xmath96 and where @xmath97 denotes the @xmath98-th bernoulli number . in particular , the values @xmath99 are rational polynomials in @xmath100 .",

    "moreover , @xmath119 as @xmath120 .    some of the ideas used in the proofs of theorem  [ tb ] and  [ tb2 ] can be easily generalized to a more general setting .",

    "moreover , if we assume that @xmath121 is holomorphic on @xmath135 , then it follows that the taylor series of @xmath136 converges very fast , @xmath137 for any @xmath138 and @xmath109 such that @xmath139 .",
    "also , @xmath140 decays faster than any power of @xmath29 at infinity and so the second sum in   is rapidly convergent and is very small if we let @xmath29 go to zero in @xmath141 . in section  [ vf ]",
    "we will give an explicit example ; a subsequent paper will elaborate on this .",
    "the voronoi summation formula is an important tool in analytic number theory ; in its simplest form , it states that , if @xmath142 is a smooth function of compact support , then @xmath143 where @xmath144 this formula can be deduced from   ( or also directly from  ) as a very easy corollary .",
    "actually , voronoi s formula can be interpreted as a version of the formula   confined to the positive real axis .",
    "if we get rid of this limitation and we use directly the period formula  , we are able to obtain interesting results also for weight functions of the shape @xmath145 , for which the voronoi summation formula fails to give a useful formula .",
    "( try it ! ) thus , we have a generalization of voronoi s formula .",
    "the use of a weight function of the shape @xmath146 is fundamental to investigate the smoothly weighted second moment of the riemann zeta function , @xmath147 in the case @xmath148 .",
    "these integrals play a major role in the theory of the riemann zeta function and getting good upper bounds on their growth as @xmath149 would imply the lindelf hypothesis .",
