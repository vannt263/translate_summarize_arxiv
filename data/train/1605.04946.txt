    "the universe is assumed to be in a pure state .",
    "we also assume that it is subject to a completely arbitrary _ global constraint _",
    "for example , in the standard context of statistical mechanics it can be the fixed energy constraint .",
    "such constraint is concretely imposed by restricting the allowed states to the subspace @xmath7 of the states of the total hilbert space @xmath8 which satisfy the constraint @xmath6 : @xmath9 @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the hilbert spaces of the system and environment , with dimensions @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",

    "this means that , as the dimension of the hilbert space @xmath31 grows , a huge fraction of states gets concentrated around the canonical state .",
    "the proof of the result relies on the _ concentration of measure phenomenon_. the key tool to prove this result is the _ levy _ lemma , which we briefly report for completeness in appendix [ levy ] .",

    "therefore , each edge of the graph is dual to a surface patch intersecting the edge and the area of such patch is proportional to the representation @xmath42 .",

    "the main reason behind the choice of @xmath73 as constrained space is that in the semiclassical limit one can think of this system , dually , as a closed surface with area @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the planck length .",

    "this simple computation provides evidence that the result in eq.([eq : ent2 ] ) follows from the two aforementioned assumptions .      eventually , we compute the behaviour of the entropy in the intermediate regime @xmath201 . with respect to the previous cases ,",
    "this regime does not add anything new to the analysis .",
    "the observed behaviour is extensive in the number of links of the system , with a coefficient which is slightly different from the previous one :    @xmath202)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the relevant computation can be found in the supplementary material .",
    "in this manuscript we extend the so - called typicality approach , originally formulated in statistical mechanics contexts , to a specific class of tensor network states given by @xmath0 invariant spin networks . in particular , following the approach given in @xcite ,",
    "we investigate the notion of canonical typicality for a simple class of spin network states given by @xmath1-valent intertwiner graphs with fixed total area .",
    "our results do not depend on the physical interpretation of the spin - network , however they are mainly motivated by the fact that spin networks provide a gauge - invariant basis for the kinematical hilbert space of several background independent quantum gravity approaches , including loop quantum gravity , spin - foam gravity and group field theories .",
    "the first result is the very existence of a regime in which we show the emergence of a canonical typical state , of which we give the explicit form .",
    "geometrically , such a reduced state describes a patch of the surface comprising the volume dual to the intertwiner .",
    "the structure of correlations described by the state should tell us how local patches glue together to form a closed connected surface in the quantum regime .",
    "we find that , within the typicality regime , the canonical state tends to an exponential of the total spin of the subsystem with an interesting departure from the gibbs state .",
    "the exponential decay  la gibbs of the reduced state is perturbed by a parametric dependence on the norm of the total angular momentum vector of the subsystem ( closure defect ) .",
    "such a feature provides a signature of the non local correlations enforced by the global gauge symmetry constraint .",
    "this is our second result .",
    "we study some interesting properties of the typical state within two complementary regimes , @xmath203 and @xmath204 . in both cases , we find that the area - law for the entropy of a surface patch must be satisfied at the local level , up to sub - leading logarithmic corrections due to the unavoidable dependence of the state from the closure defect . however , the area scaling interpretation of the entropy in the two regimes is quite different . in the @xmath203 regime ,",
    "the result is related to the definition of a generalised gibbs equilibrium state .",
    "the area is playing the role of the energy , as imposed by the specific choice of the global constraint , requiring total area conservation .    on the other hand , in the @xmath205 regime",
    ", the area scaling is given by the extensivity of the entropy in the number of links comprising the reduced state , as for the case of the generalised ( non @xmath0-gauge invariant ) spin networks @xcite .",
    "in this regimen , each link contributes independently to the result , indicating that the global constraints are very little affecting the local structure of correlations of the spin network state .",
    "still , interestingly , the remainder of the presence of the constraints can be read in the definition of what looks like an effective dimension for the single link hilbert space .",
    "we interpret these results as the proof that , within the typicality regime , there are certain ( local ) properties of quantum geometry which are `` universal '' , namely independent of the specific form of the global pure spin network state and descending directly from the physical definition of the system encoded in the choice of the global constraints .",
    "we would like to stress that our result is purely kinematic , being a statistical analysis on the hilbert space of spin - network states .",
    "for the case of a simple intertwiner state , such study necessarily requires to consider a system with a _ large number _ of edges , beyond the very large dimensionality of the hilbert space of the single constituents . in this sense ,",
    "the presented statistical analysis and thermal interpretation is very different from what recently done in @xcite , considering quantum geometry states characterised by few constituents with a high dimensional hilbert space .",
    "in fact , we expect a large number statistical analysis to play a prominent role in facing the problem of the continuum in quantum gravity .",
    "therefore we think it is important to propose and develop new technical tools which are able to deal with a large numbers of elementary constituents and extract physically interesting behaviours .",
    "+ the kinematic nature of the statement of typicality , together with its general formulation in terms of constrained hilbert spaces given in @xcite , provide an important tool to study the possibility of a thermal characterisation of reduced states of quantum geometry , regardless of any hamiltonian evolution in time . beyond the simple case considered in the paper and in a more general perspective",
    ", we expect typicality to be useful to understand how large the effective hilbert space of the theory can be , given the complete set of constraints defining it .",
    "it will also help in understanding which typical features we should expect to characterise a state in such space .",
    "if we think of dynamics as a flow on the constrained hilbert space , we generally expect that , even if the initial state is highly un - typical after a certain `` time''-scale we will find the system in a state which is extremely close to the typical state .",
    "this happens because , as it has been shown in the original paper on typicality , the number of states close to the typical state are the overwhelming majority . + finally , it is interesting to look at the proposed `` generalised '' thermal characterisation of a local surface patch , within the standard lqg description of the horizon , as a closed surface made of patches of quantized area . differently from the _ isolated horizon _",
    "analysis ( see e.g. @xcite ) , in our description the thermal character of the local patch is not ( semi)classically induced by the thermal properties of a black hole horizon geometry , but emerges from a purely quantum description . in this sense , our picture goes along with the informational theoretic characterisation of the horizon proposed in @xcite .",
    "in fact , we think that typicality could be used to define an information theoretic notion of quantum horizon , as the boundary of a generic region of the quantum space with an emergent thermal behaviour .",
    "we leave this for future work .",
    "the authors are grateful to daniele oriti , aldo riello and thibaut josset for interesting discussions and careful readings of the draft of the paper .",
    "in order to better understand the result it is useful to look at its most important step , which is the so - called levy - lemma . take an hypersphere in @xmath206 dimensions @xmath207 , with surface area @xmath208 .",
    "any function @xmath209 of the point which does not vary too much      will have the property that its value on a randomly chosen point @xmath211 will approximately be close to the mean value .",
    "@xmath212}{\\mathrm{vol}\\left [ \\phi \\in   s^d \\right ] } \\leq 4 \\ ,",

    "@xmath215 is the average of the function @xmath209 over the whole hilbert space and @xmath216 $ ] is the total volume of the hilbert space .",
    "integrals over the hilbert space are performed using the unique unitarily invariant haar measure . + the levy lemma is essentially needed to conclude that all but an exponentially small fraction of all states are quite close to the canonical state .",
    "this is a very specific manifestation of a general phenomenon called `` concentration of measure '' , which occurs in high - dimensional statistical spaces @xcite .",
    "the effect of such result is that we can re - think about the `` a priori equal probability '' principle as an `` apparently equal probability '' stating that : as far as a small system is concerned almost every state of the universe seems similar to its average state , which is the maximally mixed state @xmath217 .",
