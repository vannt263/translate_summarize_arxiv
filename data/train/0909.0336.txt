    "the advent of radioactive ion beams has opened the possibility of reaching unexplored regions of the nuclear landscape . this has lead to the realization that single particle levels evolve with changing the number of neutrons or protons  @xcite , sometimes invalidating the conventional magic numbers known for stable isotopes .",
    "another unexpected observation is that spectroscopic factors for the same states ( which we will also refer to as _ quasiparticles _ ) may change dramatically with proton / neutron asymmetry  @xcite .",

    "for both methods , the number of configurations to be dealt with scales more gently with the increasing particle numbers and the infinite summation of connected diagrams guarantees size extensivity and accuracy .",
    "applications to medium - heavy nuclei are ( for the moment ) limited to systems around closed subshell structures .    for open shell systems , standard shell model calculations",

    "one could attempt to bridge shell model hamiltonians to realistic nuclear forces by employing the above _ ab - initio _ approaches and studying quasiparticle states and their interactions for different shell closures across the nuclear chart . in this respect ,",
    "the scgf is the method of choice since the one - body green s function already contains , in its energy representation , all information of quasiparticle properties . as we will note below , self - consistency ( sc )",

    "these are based on the realistic chiral n3lo interaction and employ also a g - matrix to account for the effects of short - range correlations .",
    "a dependence on proton - neutron asymmetry is indeed observed in the frpa , with the spectroscopic factors becoming smaller with increasing nucleon separation energy .",
