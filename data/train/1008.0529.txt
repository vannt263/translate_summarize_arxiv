    "the accepted strategy , which allows to classify the solutions for the matrix order parameter from the self - consistent equations , relays on symmetry considerations @xcite .",
    "the symmetry arguments alone allow to identify stationary states of the free energy , as it was done recently for the spinor condensates @xcite . here",
    "we need not only to identify the symmetry classified states , but we also want to investigate the phase diagram as a function of the interaction parameters . therefore , we have to compare free energy of symmetry classified phases to find the minimal one . in the investigation of superfluid @xmath60he",
    "it was observed @xcite , but not strictly proven , that the phase possessing the highest remaining symmetry corresponds indeed to a local , and very often to the global free energy minimum .",
    "we follow the standard symmetry classification approach .",
    "we start by determining the highest allowed symmetry phase , and then we consider the solutions with a lower symmetry . for the sake of completeness of the presentation we give below a more detailed account of this derivation .",
    "we will use the classification introduced in this section to determine numerically the phase diagram , by solving the non - linear mean field equations within a given symmetry class .",
    "the full symmetry of our system ( in a generic case @xmath61 ) involves the gauge and the spin rotation symmetry , so it is @xmath62 .",
    "this symmetry is smaller then in the superfluid @xmath60he case , which has @xmath63 symmetry group .",
    "the possibility of breaking the gauge invariance is crucial in our search of the phases with pairing .",
    "symmetry of our system allows the gauge symmetry to be broken not only independently , but also in a combination with the spin symmetry operation .",
    "thus we have to consider also the possibility of gauge - spin symmetry breaking , similar to superfluid @xmath60he .",
    "we start the discussion of symmetry with the global @xmath64 gauge symmetry transformation @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is a constant phase .",

    "the spin rotation so(3 ) is described by a unitary matrix @xmath69 , which acts as follows : @xmath70 .",
    "the general rotation matrix @xmath69 can be parameterized by three euler angles of elementary rotations generated by three components of the spin - one operator . from the definitions of the averages @xmath44 and @xmath45 we obtain the transformation rules @xmath71 the above transformations substituted to and give the following spin rotation of the effective potential and the pairing order parameter : @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "we have used the identity @xmath74 , which follows from the explicit form @xmath75 .",
    "one can check that the right - hand side of the mean field equation eq .   consequently transforms as @xmath76 , with a unitary @xmath77 , where @xmath78 stands for a block diagonal matrix .",
    "the left - hand side of this equation transforms upon in the same manner , thus verifying the @xmath1 spin rotation symmetry of our mean - field formulation .",
    "_ no broken symmetry .",
    "_ the requirement of invariance upon the full symmetry transformation @xmath62 applied to @xmath53 and @xmath52 gives as the only solution @xmath79 and @xmath80 , where @xmath81 .",
    "the single site density is @xmath82 and the occupation matrix reads @xmath83 .",
    "this describes a free boson gas with a renormalized chemical potential due to the hartree - fock treatment of the contact interaction .",
    "_ singlet phase .",
    "_ the highest possible symmetry phase with non - zero pairing amplitude arises when we break the @xmath64 gauge symmetry , but leave the spin rotation symmetry .",
    "we derive from the invariance condition @xmath84 that for a general @xmath69 the order parameter has to be @xmath85 with some complex @xmath86 and @xmath87 , with @xmath88 the same as in the free case discussed above .",
    "going back to eq .",
    "we find that the expectation values of the bosonic pair operators @xmath89 are non - zero only for @xmath17 in this @xmath1 symmetric phase .",
    "we will call this phase the _ singlet phase _ as pairing happens only in the singlet channel , with the finite order parameter @xmath90 .",
    "_ quintet phase .",
    "_ we search now for paired phases , which allow for non - vanishing @xmath18 ( i.e. quintet ) components of the order parameter . the simplest way to achieve",
    "this is by lowering the spin rotation @xmath1 symmetry to an axial @xmath64 symmetry .",
    "we choose an arbitrary quantization axis and express the spin rotations around this axis as @xmath91 , with some angle @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "we require now a more general spin - gauge invariance condition for the order parameter @xmath94 where the gauge symmetry breaking phase @xmath66 can now depend on the spin rotation angle @xmath92 .",
    "we obtain three different solutions , which are presented below :    [ all ] @xmath95    we follow the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite to label the above spin - rotation breaking axial phases .",
    "remaining solutions with @xmath96 , and @xmath97 can be obtained by changing the direction of the quantization axis , so they do not describe a different symmetry phase .",
    "the only non - zero pair expectation amplitude is @xmath98 for the @xmath99 phase and @xmath100 for @xmath101 , which follows from the comparison of @xmath52 definition in with the result . in these two axial phases",
    "the symmetry allows for pairing only in the _ quintet channel_. the remaining @xmath102 phase has a mixed singlet  quintet pairing order parameter , which has to be parameterized by two ( complex ) numbers @xmath86 and @xmath103 .",
    "the hartree ",
    "fock potential @xmath53 in all the axial phases is restricted by the symmetry to be diagonal .",
    "this brings a possibility of magnetic order , coexisting with the pairing , marked by spin rotation symmetry breaking in the spin dependent site occupation .      within only @xmath41 matrix representations one can not construct the icosahedral or octahedral symmetry , without allowing for generation of all possible rotations .",
    "the biggest non - trivial discrete symmetry is thus @xmath104  the symmetry group of tetrahedron without reflections .",
    "the set of group generators can be explicitly expressed as @xmath105 , where we use @xmath41 matrix representation of spin one with @xmath106 . substituting these generators for @xmath69 in the invariance condition we obtain as the only solution @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "the singlet phase , introduced from the symmetry arguments in section [ chapcont ] is our natural candidate for a physically attainable phase .",
    "the system in the singlet phase has a maximal remaining symmetry of all the phases with non - zero pairing .",
    "the singlet phase is unitary , meaning that the matrix order parameter @xmath52 is proportional to a unitary matrix .",
    "stable phases of liquid @xmath60he were previously found to be unitary @xcite as well .",

    "the quasi - particle excitation energy @xmath111 is a triple degenerate eigenvalue of @xmath55 as defined in eq .  .",
    "we can now directly calculate the generalized occupation factor in the mean field equation @xmath112 with @xmath113 .",

    "we substitute into @xmath55 in and then equate to the left - hand side of eq .  .",
    "the resulting self - consistent equations in the singlet phase take a simple form    [ selfbcs ] @xmath115    the first equation provides a relation between the average occupation @xmath82 and the chemical potential @xmath7 , while the second guarantees a non - zero paring amplitude .",
    "the form of this second equation is similar to the gap equation in the bcs theory , but with a different function @xmath116 due to boson statistics of condensating quasiparticles .",
    "interestingly , these equations are formally equivalent to the one obtained in the case of scalar attracting bosons in ref .",
    "the only difference is that the optical lattice provides a natural ultraviolet cutoff in our model .",
    "the existence of the bcs type singlet solutions depends only on the strength @xmath2 of attraction in the singlet channel and is insensitive to scattering in the quintet channel .",
    "we will show in the next section that the singlet paired phase of attracting bosons can be stabilized by a repulsive quintet interaction .",
    "this is in a marked difference to the scalar case , where the system always undergoes a mechanical collapse before reaching evans - rashid transition @xcite .",
    "we note that the quasiparticles in bcs type bosonic condensate may undergo a statistical ( bose - einstein ) condensation @xcite .",
    "the transition occurs when the excitation spectrum in eq .",
    "becomes gapless @xcite .",
    "the singular condition @xmath117 can be satisfied in a thermodynamic limit for @xmath118 which fixes the chemical potential similarly to a standard bec .",
    "we separate the @xmath119 terms to obtain @xmath120 where we introduce @xmath121  a finite average density for quasi - particles with @xmath119 only .",
