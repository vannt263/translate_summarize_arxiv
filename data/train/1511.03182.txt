    "there is a long tradition of using galactic open clusters to study the structure and evolution of the milky way disk .",
    "such ensembles contain stars with common properties , making it possible to establish solid estimates for their basic parameters ( metallicity , age , and distance ) in statistical fashion ( netopil et al . 2015 ) .",
    "relationships between parameters , such as the age - metallicity relation , the radial and vertical metallicity gradients , and so forth , make it possible to characterise the disk , and understand how it formed and evolved ( magrini et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "the simple spatial distribution of star clusters permits us to derive global structural properties for the disk , such as the radial and vertical scale - lengths , the disk extent , and its spiral structure ( popova & loktin 2005 , 2008 ; vazquez et al .",
    "2008 ; baume et al . 2009",
    "; carraro et al .",
    "2010 , 2015 ) . over the years",
    "such studies have generated a picture of the milky way disk that is becoming more and more solid , including : ( 1 ) the location and shape of the spiral arms close to the sun ( perseus , orion , and carina - sagittarius ) , ( 2 ) evidence that the outer disk is warped and flared , and , finally , ( 3 ) evidence that the galactic disk does not have a clear density and luminosity cut - off , but most probably only a break , in full analogy with spiral galaxies in the local universe ( laine et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "a novel approach to such studies was recently developed , beginning with early studies of the third galactic quadrant ( @xmath3 ) by carraro et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and moitinho et al .",
    "it consists of analysing the distribution of stars not only in well - known star clusters , but also in their surrounding background and forground fields . that is made possible by the structure and geometry of the galactic disk in the third quadrant , which displays a significant warp . while the warp was noticed many years ago ( vogt & moffat 1975 ; carney & seitzer 1991 ) , it is only recently that the implications have been considered properly ( momany et al .",
    "essentially , because of significant disk warping in the third quadrant , there are lines of sight that may completely cross the thin and thick disk .",
    "it is particularly important for the young thin disk , which , once intersected , produces prominent features in color - magnitude diagrams for the field , popularised as _",
    "blue plumes_. the nature of the features ( color width , magnitude , tilting , and so forth ) depends on the line of sight in a way that makes it possible in theory to reconstruct the properties of the thin disk by viewing in different galactic directions ( carraro 2015 ) .",
    "such a scenario has recently become more complex as a result of two additional evidences .",
    "first , the thick disk is also warped , and that produces additional features in color - magnitude diagrams that , in the past , were often interpreted as evidence of an extragalactic population ( canis major and/or monoceros ) .",
    "second , the thick and thin disk are also flared ( lopez - corredoira & molg 2014 ) , implying that , occasionally , one can find young populations far from the expected disk locus ( carraro et al . 2015 ; kalberla et al .",
    "2014 ; feast et al .",
    "it is therefore important to explore new directions in such studies .",
    "we have adopted the strategy of centering our fields on cataloged open clusters ( dias et al .",
    "it is particularly efficient and successful since it permits us first of all to derive properties of previously unstudied groups , while at the same time providing an indication of the quality of our data , since in several cases the fields we select contain clusters for which some data are available for comparison . from such considerations we selected for study five fields strategically located in the third quadrant , and present the results here .",
    "the identity of the fields and their equatorial and galactic coordinates are listed in table  1 .",
    "readers may note the extreme nature of the lines of sight selected , since they cover a broad region of the third galactic quadrant , both in longitude and in latitude .",
    "one field lying well below the galactic plane ( eso489  sc01 ) was selected in an attempt to find a direction where contamination by the thin and thick disks is negligible .",
    "a line of sight above the plane ( haffner  22 ) and opposite with respect to the formal galactic plane ( eso489  sc01 ) was also chosen , since that is additionally where one expects minimal contamination by thin or thick disk populations . the other three fields ( ruprecht  11 , ngc  2215 , and ngc  2354 ) span a galactic latitude range where one expects to find important but different contaminations by stars belonging to the young thin disk , the old thin disk , and perhaps also the thick disk .",
    "except for the star cluster ngc  2215 , the fields have never received proper attention previously .",
    "the five selected fields turn out to be very complex , and identification of the different stellar populations has been difficult .",
    "to tackle the challenge as efficiently as possible , we make use here of a combination of star counts and photometric analysis in order to separate different populations and establish their intrinsic properties ( distance , reddening , and age ) and spatial distributions .",
    "our approach is not tied to any galactic model , in contrast with studies linked to the besancon ( robin et al .",
    "2003 ) or trilegal ( giradi et al . 2005 ) models , which assume an _ a priori _ description of the milky way , and which led to erroneous results in the past . among them",
    "we recall the claim for a sharp cut - off in the light and mass distribution along the galactic plane ( robin et al .",
    "1992 , revised by carraro et al .",
    "2010 ) , and the interpretation of the canis major over density as a dwarf galaxy ( bellazzini et al .",
    "2004 , revised by moitinho et al .",
    "2006 and momany et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "we believe that the present study shows clearly that features belonging to the thin and thick disk are not evenly distributed across the third galactic quadrant , but follow a pattern where the thin disk is warped and organised in spiral arms ( orion , perseus , and norma - cygnus ) , in confirmation of our earlier results ( carraro et al .",

    "the layout of the present work is as follows .",

    "7 summarises our findings .           0.1truecm    .equatorial and galactic coordinates of program fields , as listed by webda . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we underline here that in the case of haffner 22 and ngc 2354 the size of the fields may simply be too small , so that the estimated radius would refer only to the cluster core .",
    "as noted by kholopov ( 1969 ) , most star clusters consist of a concentrated nu- clear region surrounded by a lower density corona , typically larger than the fields imaged for each cluster .",
    "to establish the full extent of each cluster would therefore require estimating star densities be- yond the fields surveyed here ( see , for example , turner et al .",
    "it seems therefore more conservative to consider the values in ta- ble 4 as lower estimates of radius .    in the specific case of ngc 2354 , the map in fig .",
    "5 ( upper mid panel ) reveals a second density maximum about 7 arcmin from the center reported in table  4 . if the density profile for ngc 2354 is derived by considering only to @xmath4 arcmin ( as in fig .",
    "6 ) , the second maximum is not detectable .",
    "if it is considered as part of the cluster ( which is highly probable ) , the cluster radius might be as large as @xmath5 arcmin .",
    "the availability of photometry in four different bands ( _ ubvi _ ) and 2mass observations for each cluster field make it possible to establish reddenings for each cluster using two - color data .",
    "the reddening law in several open clusters lying along segments of the milky way examined here was studied forty years ago by turner ( 1976 ) , and more recently by turner ( 2012 ) , who established localized reddening laws described by e@xmath6/e@xmath7 , which was adopted here .",
    "the corresponding derived values of @xmath8 range from 2.75 to 3.20 , but a recent study of the reddening law ( turner et al .",
    "2014 ) implies that a value of @xmath9 would be more suitable .",
    "the reddening law in the kron - cousins system appears to be more stable , with a value of e@xmath10/e@xmath11 being appropriate for all values of e@xmath6/e@xmath12 ( turner et al .",
    "2011 ) . for clusters lying away from the galactic plane , a reddening law of slope e@xmath6/e@xmath13 with @xmath14 would seem to be more appropriate ( turner et al . 2014 ) , but the reddening in such fields is typically so small that any differences do not affect the results significantly .",
    "color - color diagrams in _ ubv _ and _ bvi _ for each field are shown in fig .  7 , where the intrinsic relations in _ ubv _ are from turner ( 1996 ) and those in _",
    "bvi _ are from turner et al .",
    "the data were limited to stars brighter than _ v _ = 15 in order to limit uncertainties in the colors to about @xmath15 .",
    "the _ ubv _",
    "relation for gk - type stars incorporates the main sequence relation for stars of pleiades ( roughly solar ) metallicity ( turner 1979 ) as well as the relation for `` zero - age zero - rotation '' af - type stars ( see turner 2012 ) , so is ideal for detecting , although not calibrating , the ultraviolet excesses expected for cooler stars lying away from the galactic plane ( wildey et al . 1962 ) .",
    "the intrinsic colors of giant stars ( lc iii ) are also indistinguishable from those of dwarfs of late spectral type , so the relation is also useful for establishing the reddening of old open clusters .",
    "it is important to point out that interstellar reddening and extinction does not characteristically increase linearly with distance , as is sometimes assumed .",
    "rather , it increases in direct proportion to the amount of dust , or possibly hydrogen , along the line of sight ( turner et al . 2011 , 2014 ) . in such conditions all photometrically - measured stars in a field contribute valuable information on the reddening of both cluster and field stars .    the data of fig .  7",
    "provide insights into the reddening in each field . in the direction of eso489  sc01 , for example , only a few late - type stars",
    "are unreddened , and most exhibit ultraviolet ( uv ) excesses , typical of directions away from the plane .",
    "most solar - metallicity stars exhibit a reddening of e@xmath16 , with the reddening and extinction occurring in dust clouds close to the galactic plane .",
    "most stars lying in the direction of ngc  2215 , by contrast , are significantly reddened , on average by e@xmath17 , with very few unreddened foreground stars in the population .",
    "stars lying in ruprecht  11 exhibit more complicated reddening .",
    "many are unreddened foreground objects , but at some distance differential reddening takes over .",
    "clumps of stars reddened by e@xmath18 and e@xmath19 are evident , with the main group being less reddened .",
    "a full differential reddening analysis may be needed to sort out cluster parameters .",
    "the stars lying towards ngc  2354 are similar in some respects , in displaying differential reddening , although there does appear to be a main group reddened by e@xmath20 .",
    "finally , stars lying towards haffner  22 are less complicated , with a main group displaying reddenings of e@xmath21 .      with the results of the previous section on hand , it is possible to highlight star cluster sequences in the cmds , and then estimate their fundamental parameters by means of isochrone fitting .",
    "use was made of the most recent suite of padova models ( bressan et al .",
    "2012 ) , in conjunction with a radial selection of stars using the cluster center and radius estimated in table  4 .",
    "the results are shown in the panels of fig .  8 , with comments on a cluster - by - cluster basis .",
    "it is important to stress that the cmd sequences are sometimes difficult to fit because of field star contamination and differential reddening . to make the fitting solutions less confusing in fig .  8 , only the best - fit isochrones are shown .",
    "they were always superposed by eye .",
    "associated uncertainties were also estimated by eye , adjusting each isochrone in color and magnitude until an acceptable fit was no longer possible . + * ngc  2215 * + ngc  2315 is a difficult cluster to study , since it is sparsely populated , without an obvious rgb clump and with a poorly - defined to region . yet the cluster emerges clearly as an overdensity above the general field , and its ms is obvious ( upper left panel in fig .",

    "nevertheless , it does appear to be a cluster , provided the group of red stars at @xmath27 is the rgb clump ( see lower - right panel in fig .",
    "main - sequence and isochrone fitting then yields the following parameters for ruprecht  11 : age of 1.5@xmath240.5 gyr , reddening of e@xmath12 = 0.17@xmath240.02 , and distance of 1.87@xmath240.13 kpc . + * eso489  sc01 * + no fit was made for the eso489  sc01 star distribution since there is no evidence for a cluster lying in this direction .",
    "the cmd and color - color plots leave the impression of a lightly - reddened star field lying toward the galactic halo .",
    "+ the results of our analysis are summarised in table  4 .",
    "it is now possible to analyse the surrounding star fields along the lines of sight under investigation , by interpreting the various features highlighted in section  4 .",
    "blue plumes are present in the background of three clusters , as noted above : ngc  2354 , ruprecht  11 , and haffner 22 .",
    "no such feature is detected in the field of eso489  sc01 , while a weak background group of yellow dwarfs is visible in the field of ngc  2215 .",
    "it is necessary to establish if the stars in each blue plume are young or old , or if they are dispersed in distance or spatially confined .    for that we consider in each cmd the magnitude strip that encompasses blue plume stars : @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 for ngc  2354 , haffner  22 , and ruprecht  11 , respectively .",
    "the stars are plotted in _",
    "color - color diagrams in fig .",
    "9 to establish their reddening distribution and approximate spectral types , from which can be inferred an approximate age .",
    "dwarf stars occupy the bluest region of the diagram ( _ b  v _ bluer than 0.5 for ngc  2354 and haffner  22 , and bluer than 0.75 for ruprecht  11 ) .",
    "the solid black line is the intrinsic relation described earlier , while the red line is the same relation reddened to fit the bluest plume stars .",
    "the location of the blue branch does not depend on metallicity ( carraro et al .",
    "the color excesses of the bluest stars correspond to reddenings e@xmath31 0.25 , 0.20 , and 0.53 for ngc  2354 , haffner  22 , and ruprecht  11 , respectively .        from the data of fig .",
    "9 we infer that the earliest spectral types are b8 for ngc  2354 , b9 for haffner  22 , and b4 for ruprecht  11 , implying ages for blue plume stars in the direction of ruprecht  11 as young as 50 million years , and slightly older , up to 70 - 80 million years , for those in the lines of sight to ngc  2354 and haffner 22 .",
    "such ages are typical of stars in young open clusters that are preferentially located close to the spiral arm where they formed .",
    "as noted earlier , the blue plumes in ngc  2354 and ruprecht  11 appear to correspond to a spatially confined population , while blue plume stars in haffner  22 are much more scattered , which would mean they are distributed over a larger range of distances .",
    "the mean distances from the sun are estimated by superimposing a zams on the stars in the cmds , as illustrated in fig .  10 . that yields ( m - m ) = 15.5@xmath240.2 for ngc  2354 , (",
    "m - m ) = 11.2 to 14.30@xmath240.2 for haffner  22 , and ( m - m ) = 16.4@xmath240.1 for ruprecht  11 .",
    "therefore , in the lines of sight towards ngc  2354 and ruprecht  11 young stars appear to peak in their distribution at distances of 9.0@xmath240.8 kpc and 8.2@xmath240.4 kpc , respectively , whereas blue plume stars lying towards haffner  22 are dispersed over distance of 1.25.5@xmath240.5 kpc .",
    "such extreme galacto - centric distances challenge modern galactic models that adopt a sharp disk cut - off at 1214 kpc ( carraro et al .",
    "2010 ) , and confirm beyond any reasonable doubt that the young galactic disk is significantly warped at these galactic longitudes .",
    "attention can now be focused on the last prominent feature identified in the cmds of ngc  2354 , ngc  2215 , and ruprecht  11 , a thick , faint ms typical of an intermediate - age , possibly metal poor , stellar population .",
    "the feature was not detected in eso489  sc01 or in haffner  22 , although in the latter case the to may simply be hidden because it is confused with the cluster itself and with the ms of foreground stars , located between the sun and the cluster .",
    "the direction where the population is best visible is that towards ngc  2354 .",
    "its ms is broad in color for various reasons , among which are variable reddening across the field , different distances for the stars , and contamination by other galactic components ( thick disk and halo ) sampled by the line of sight to the cluster .",
    "the same is true for ngc  2215 and ruprecht  11 . in the case of ngc  2215 ,",
    "fitzgerald et al . ( 2015 ) suggest that this population is about 5 gyr old for a metallicity as low as [ fe / h ] = 0.8 , which would then represent material from the galactic thick disk , with little to do with the perseus arm , where a much younger population is expected .",
    "sequences such as these are routinely found in the galactic anticenter , and are normally considered to be part of the monoceros ring , a structure that might represent the leftover of an in - plane accretion event ( conn et al .",
    "such a narrow ms is not expected to be produced by the general galactic disk population when sampling either along the plane , where one can find stars at any distance , or off - plane , where one does not expect to find many thin disk stars .",
    "an alternative view has been proposed by vzquez et al .",
    "( 2008 , 2010 ) and carraro et al .",
    "( 2010 , 2015 ) , who suggest that this population is made of old thin disk stars that follow the galactic warp .",
    "as in the case of the young thin disk , the warp introduces the effect that the line of sight intersects and eventually crosses the disk completely , producing the impression of a population confined in space ( see carraro 2014 , fig  9 for an illustration of the effect ) .",
    "it should be stressed that stars belonging to this population are visible in the color - color diagrams in fig .",
    "they produce a _",
    "helmet_-like ( or _ hump_-like ) structure where stars of fg spectral type are expected .",
    "that happens at 0.5 @xmath32 for ngc  2354 , at 0.4 @xmath330.6 for haffner  22 , and at 0.5 @xmath34 0.9 for ruprecht  11 .",
    "it is an indication that such stars have ultraviolet excesses , namely they are bluer in _ u  b _ than the intrinsic relation for solar - metallicity stars , and therefore metal - poor .",
    "it confirms earlier findings by our group ( carraro et al .",
    "yet it is difficult to estimate what the metallicity is precisely , since we are looking at a population spread in space at different distances , which might include old thin disk , contamination from thick disk , and even halo stars .",
    "more importantly , the derivation of photometric metallicity using the ultraviolet excess index @xmath35 requires precise photometry and homogenous ( in terms of stellar population ) samples ( see carraro et al .",
    "at best it can be noted that the component is more metal poor than the sun .",
    "there is no obvious way to derive an age estimate for this component . in carraro",
    "( 2008a ) we superimposed two extreme isochrones to the same population ( but located at @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) and provided only an indication of a possible age range , concluding that what we are seeing at low latitude is probably thick disk population . here",
    ", we try a more empirical approach . in fig .",
    "10 we compare the cmd of stars in the ngc  2354 field with that for the intermediate - age star cluster ngc  2158 ( carraro et al .",
    "the latter is a well - known , rich , intermediate - age ( @xmath0 2 gyr ) cluster that is metal - poor ( [ fe / h = 0.3 ) , located in the second galactic quadrant .",
    "it is also known to suffer from significant variable reddening that makes it an ideal comparison with the stellar population studied here , which we tentatively assume to be composed mostly of old thin - disk stars , spread by reddening , and more metal - poor than the sun .    for the purpose of the comparison ,",
    "ngc  2518 stars were displaced in color and magnitude by @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively , to position the cluster sequence where the old , faint population in ngc  2354 is located .",
    "although contamination is strong , it can be argued that , if one eliminates blue plume stars from the ngc  2354 cmd , the ms of ngc  2158 would then reproduce and match qualitatively well the faint ms of ngc  2354 .",
    "it is not a conclusive argument , but only an attempt to provide a simple and direct comparison with similar stellar populations located in other regions of the disk , where the warp is less important . given the similarity with the ms of ngc  2158 , the faint ms would mostly be old , thin - disk population .",
    "analysed here are the cmds of five star fields located in the third galactic quadrant and centered on the catalogued open clusters ngc  2215 , ngc  2354 , haffner  22 , ruprecht  11 , and eso49  sc01 .",
    "star counts and photometry are used to discuss their nature and properties , and to provide estimates of fundamental parameters . those for ngc  2215 and ngc  2354 agree with results of previous studies , while those for haffner  22 and ruprecht  11 are new .",
    "we can not provide solid confirmation for the reality of the latter , but the former is an intermediate - age open cluster with a conspicuous rgb clump . finally , we argue that eso489  sc01 is not a star cluster , but only a chance overdensity projected toward the galactic halo .",
    "the main goal of the study was to analyse the additional features present in the cmds , namely the existence of young populations in the field of ngc  2354 , haffner  22 , and ruprecht  11 . in the case of haffner  22 , this population is not spatially confined , but is distributed along the line of sight to the cluster , from 1.2 kpc from the sun to as distant as 5.5 kpc , implying that the line of sight to haffner  22 ( at @xmath40=+3@xmath41.37 ) crosses the local arm ( orion ) only , and then misses the outer thin disk which starts to bend below the plane because of the warp at about 34 kpc from the sun ( carraro et al .",
    "2015 , vazquez et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the blue plume populations in ngc  2453 and ruprecht  11 , on the other hand , share the same properties .",
    "they describe a galactic feature confined in space , located at about 89 kpc from the sun , and about 1 kpc below the galactic plane .",
    "that feature , according to our previous investigations , coincides with the location of the outer spiral arm , also known as the norma - cygnus arm ( vazquez et al .",
    "disk warping renders it easier to detect the feature since the line of sight intersects the arm transversally , thus producing the effect of detecting a spatially confined structure ( see carraro 2014 , fig .",
    "9 , for a clear illustration of the effect ) .",
    "interestingly , no blue plume is seen in ngc  2215 at @xmath42 , which would indicate that the young disk is not present at such low latitudes .",
    "that is in agreement with the warp structure as derived by clump stars ( momany et al .",
    "2006 ) , which predicts the maximum of the warp at larger galactic longitudes ( @xmath43 ) .    an additional comment can be made . from the analysis of color - color diagrams we find that the blue plume population in ruprecht  11 ( @xmath44 ) is younger than those in ngc  2354 ( @xmath45 ) and haffner  22 ( @xmath46 ) . that may imply the existent of a vertical age gradient , with the direction towards ruprecht  11 sampling a more centrally concentrated ( and therefore younger ) region of the warped galactic thin disk",
    ".    also noted is the presence of an older , metal - poor , stellar component in the fields of ngc  2354 , ngc  2215 , and ruprecht  21 .",
    "they would be old thin disk populations , similar to that in the open cluster ngc  2158 or tombaugh  2 , and therefore not older than 2 - 3 gyr .",
    "it is , however , difficult to estimate the metallicity from photometry only .",
    "the population is present along the lines of sight in different proportions .",
    "it is quite strong towards ngc  2354 and ruprecht  11 , which are located relatively close in the third quadrant .",
    "ruprecht  11 shows a significantly larger reddening , and therefore the corresponding faint ms appears much fainter than in the case of ngc  2354 .",
    "on the other hand , ngc  2215 is located much more distant from the warped galactic plane than ngc  2354 , which implies that the line of sight to the cluster intersects a lower and less dense portion of the disk .",
    "the same population may also be present towards haffner  22 .",
    "but in that direction we may be seeing only the northern edge of the disk .",
    "in such a situation we would not be able to see a distinct to , since the line of sight , close to the sun , is almost parallel to the formal galactic plane , and stars are spread over a large distance range from the sun to the cluster , and beyond , up to 5 kpc , as in the case of the blue plume stars . beyond 5 kpc from the sun ,",
    "the line of sight would no longer intersect the disk , which is warped , and located at much lower latitudes .",
    "finally , this population is totally absent at the latitude and longitude of eso489  sc01 . in our opinion",
    ", future lines of research should focus on the derivation of stellar parameters of stars in both young and intermediate - age populations using spectroscopic data , to better assess their metallicity properties and nature .",

    "<S> multi - color photometry of the stellar populations in five fields in the third galactic quadrant centred on the clusters ngc  2215 , ngc  2354 , haffner  22 , ruprecht  11 , and eso489  sc01 is interpreted in terms of a warped and flared galactic disk , without resort to an external entity such as the popular monoceros or canis major overdensities . except for ngc  2215 , </S>",

    "<S> the data generate basic parameters for each cluster , including the distribution of stars along the line of sight . </S>",

    "<S> fields surrounding the clusters show signatures of young and intermediate - age stellar populations . </S>",
    "<S> the young population background to ngc  2354 and ruprecht  11 lies @xmath089 kpc from the sun and @xmath01 kpc below the formal galactic plane , tracing a portion of the norma - cygnus arm , challenging galactic models that adopt a sharp cut - off of the disk 12@xmath114 kpc from the galactic center . </S>",

    "<S> it has a large color spread and is difficult to locate precisely . </S>",
