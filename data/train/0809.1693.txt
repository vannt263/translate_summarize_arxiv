    "near the big bang or big crunch singularity , the matter density and the space - time curvature become arbitrarily large .",
    "it is generally believed that in this regime , quantum effects should come into play , which could even prevent the formation of the singularity .",
    "this effect has first been analzyed in  @xcite for classical gravity coupled to a second quantized matter field ; see also  @xcite . for a quantized gravitational field , this effect has been studied in  @xcite , and it was worked out in more detail in the framework of string cosmology  @xcite and in loop quantum gravity  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the above approaches , we are here more modest and work with classical gravity coupled to dirac wave functions , without using second - quantized fields . we find a new mechanism , based on the oscillations of the spin of the matter field , which tends to prevent the formation of a space - time singularity .",
    "the mechanism can be understood as a _",
    "spin condensation _ effect .",
    "an advantage of our model is that it is very simple and can be analyzed without any approximations .",
    "the dirac field could be interpreted physically as a new fermionic particle which becomes significant on the cosmological scale .",
    "alternatively , the dirac field can be understood similar to a `` quintessence ''  @xcite as effectively describing unknown fields acting in our universe on the large .",
    "describing such a cosmological field by the dirac equation seems physically natural and changes the behavior of the cosmological model drastically near the big bang or big crunch , where quantum oscillations can prevent the formation of space- time singularities depending on the initial conditions .",
    "such a bounce back may happen several times , before , generically , the solution collapses .",
    "for brevity we here restrict attention to the case of a closed universe . however , the flat and hyperbolic cases are less interesting , since they expand infinitely .",
    "we remark that the hyperbolic case allows for solutions with negative energy density where the matter turns to be repulsive ( see  @xcite ) .    for the derivation of the equations we follow the standard approach in  @xcite where we work with a torsion free connection ( for the effect of torsion see the cosmological model in einstein - cartan theory  @xcite ) .",
    "the einstein - dirac ( ed ) equations read @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the energy - momentum tensor of the dirac particles , @xmath2 is the gravitational constant , @xmath3 denotes the dirac operator , and @xmath4 is the dirac wave function ( we always work in natural units @xmath5 ) . for the metric we take the ansatz of the closed friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) geometry @xmath6 where  @xmath7 is the time for an observer at rest , @xmath8 is the scale function , and  @xmath9 is the line element on the unit @xmath10-sphere , @xmath11 where  @xmath12 is a radial variable , and  @xmath13 are the angular variables . the dirac operator in this metric can be written as ( see  @xcite ) @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the usual @xmath16 dirac matrix , and",
    "@xmath17 is the dirac operator on the unit @xmath10-sphere .",
    "the operator  @xmath17 has discrete eigenvalues @xmath18 , corresponding to a quantization of the possible momenta of the dirac particles . for a given eigenvector  @xmath19",
    ", we can separate the dirac equation with the ansatz @xmath20^{-\\frac{1}{2 } } \\left ( \\begin{matrix } \\alpha(t ) \\:\\psi_{\\lambda}(r,\\vartheta,\\varphi ) \\\\",
    "\\beta(t ) \\:\\psi_\\lambda(r,\\vartheta,\\varphi ) \\end{matrix } \\right ) , \\ ] ] thus describing the time dependence of the wave function by two complex functions  @xmath21 and  @xmath22 .",
    "in order to be consistent with the homogeneous and isotropic ansatz of the metric , the dirac spinors must also be in a homogeneous and isotropic configuration .",
    "in analogy to the method employed in  @xcite for spherical symmetry , this can be achieved by taking an anti - symmetrized product of the wave functions  ( [ ansatz ] ) , where  @xmath23 runs over an orthonormal basis of the eigenspace corresponding to a fixed  @xmath24 , where the symmetry is expressed by the fact that @xmath25 , with the sum running over all corresponding angular quantum numbers . we thus obtain a fermionic hartree - fock state composed of  @xmath26 particles .",
    "the energy momentum tensor @xmath1 can be derived in a similar way as in @xcite , see equ .",
    "( 4.4 ) . by spherical symmetry the components @xmath27 have to vanish as well as the components @xmath28 , which is due to the homogeneity in space .",
    "therefore @xmath1 is a diagonal matrix where the space components are equal , again due to the fact that our system is homogeneous in space .",
    "analogously to @xcite we derive the time component of the energy momentum tensor , which reads @xmath29 is constant in space , since the sum runs over the angular quantum numbers corresponding to @xmath24 , we obtain that @xmath30.\\ ] ] substituting the ansatz   and into the ed equations  , we obtain the following system of odes in the spinors  @xmath31 and the scale function  @xmath8 ( for a detailed derivation see  @xcite ) , @xmath32 let us mention that the equations obtained from the spacial components of the energy - momentum tensor are automatically satisfied due to the continuity equation , for which reason we omitted its exact form .",
    "let us emphasize again that all particles in our model have the same momentum @xmath24 and therefore give rise to the same spinor equation , meaning they are represented by the same spinor @xmath33 .",
    "this is what we mean by the above - mentioned notion of _ spin condensation_.    note that  ( [ einstein ] ) determines  @xmath34 only up to a sign , and at first sight this seems to lead to an ambiguity whenever  @xmath34 becomes zero .",
    "however , @xmath34 becomes uniquely determined by demanding that  @xmath8 be twice differentiable , implying that  @xmath34 must change sign at every zero of  @xmath34 .",
    "normalizing the probability integral to one , we obtain the condition @xmath35 ) , one sees that this normalization condition is indeed time independent .",
    "a short calculation shows that the equations  ( [ dirac ] , [ einstein ] ) are for any  @xmath36 invariant under the scalings @xmath37 since this scaling changes the norm of the spinors , it is no loss of generality to replace  ( [ norm1 ] ) by the simpler condition @xmath38 ) equals one .",
    "the resulting ed system involves the physical parameters  @xmath39 ( the rest mass of the dirac particles ) and  @xmath24 ( the dirac momentum , also related to the number of particles ) , as well as two free parameters to set the initial conditions of the spinors  @xmath21 and  @xmath22 .",
    "these four parameters describe all the physical configurations of our system .",
    "for the analysis of the system of odes  ( [ dirac ] , [ einstein ] ) it is convenient to regard the spinor @xmath31 as a two - level quantum state , and to represent it by a bloch vector  @xmath40 .",
    "more precisely , introducing the @xmath10-vectors @xmath41 ( where  @xmath42 are the pauli matrices , and  @xmath43 are the standard basis vectors in  @xmath44 ) , the ed equations become @xmath45 ( where  ` @xmath46 ' and  ` @xmath47 ' denote the cross product and the scalar product in euclidean  @xmath44 , respectively ) . to further simplify the equations , we introduce a rotation  @xmath48 around the @xmath49-axis , such that  @xmath50 becomes parallel to  @xmath51 , @xmath52 then the vector  @xmath53 satisfies the equations @xmath54 where @xmath55 we refer to the two equations in  ( [ bloch ] ) as the dirac and einstein equations in the bloch representation , respectively .",
    "notice that equation can only have solutions if @xmath56 is negative .    in the bloch representation",
    ", one can most easily recover the dust and radiation dominated frw - geometries .",
    "in the two limiting cases  @xmath57 and  @xmath58 , the second term in  ( [ ddef ] ) drops out , and thus the ed equations simplify respectively to @xmath59 in both cases , the dirac equation describes a rotation around the fixed axis  @xmath51 .",
    "this implies that  @xmath56 is constant in time , and thus the einstein equations reduce to the well - known friedmann equations for a radiation dominated universe and a dust universe , respectively .",
    "note that the components  @xmath60 and  @xmath61 do oscillate due to quantum effects .",
    "these oscillations can be understood as the familiar `` zitterbewegung '' of dirac particles . but these quantum oscillations do not enter the einstein equations .",
    "away from the above limiting cases , the function  @xmath56 is in general not constant , but it takes part in the oscillations as described by the first equation in  . as a consequence , the dynamics can no longer be described by a single friedmann equation , but only by the coupled system of einstein - dirac equations  .",
    "the relevant length scale is characterized by the radius @xmath62 on this length scale , the quantum oscillations do enter the einstein equations , leading to effects which go beyond the scope of classical cosmology .",
    "we point out that the radius  @xmath63 can be much larger than the planck length .",
    "thus , in contrast to  @xcite , our mechanism is not related to quantum gravity ; instead we are working consistently within the framework of einstein s general theory of relativity .",
    "using a standard ode solver , we shoot for numerical solutions starting at the point where the scale function  @xmath8 reaches its maximum @xmath64 , solving forward and backwards in time , until we reach a big crunch or big bang singularity , respectively . in  figure  [ figcrunch ]",
    "a typical solution is shown .",
    "the function  @xmath8 increases after the big bang similar as in the classical frw solution up to its maximal value  @xmath64 , where it starts decreasing .",
    ", @xmath65 and  @xmath66.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ] @xmath67 , @xmath65 and  @xmath66.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ] + , @xmath65 and  @xmath66.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ] @xmath67 , @xmath65 and  @xmath66.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    the classical contraction stops on the scale  @xmath68 , where the quantum oscillations become important .",
    "this leads to an oscillatory behavior of  @xmath8 . as a consequence",
    ", the sign of  @xmath34 may flip at some minimal radius  @xmath69 , where the universe again begins to expand , going over to a classical frw - like space - time .",
    "the functions  @xmath60 and  @xmath61 oscillate , with slightly varying amplitude .",
    "the function  @xmath56 is nearly constant in the classical region , but becomes oscillatory near the quantum regime  @xmath68 ( see figure  [ figcrunch ] ) ; its nonlinear interplay with the scale function  @xmath8 leads to the surprising effect that the big crunch is avoided .",
    "the behavior in the quantum regime depends crucially on the phase  @xmath70 of the dirac oscillations , defined by  @xmath71 . in figure  [ figprob ]",
    "the minimal radius  @xmath69 is plotted as a function of the initial value of  @xmath70 .     for  @xmath72 , @xmath65 and  @xmath66.,width=302 ]    if  @xmath73 , the big crunch is avoided and  @xmath8 `` bounces back , '' whereas in the case  @xmath74 the big crunch appears despite the quantum effects .",
    "considering the phase  @xmath70 as unknown , one can give the result of figure  [ figprob ] a statistical interpretation : for a random initial phase , this bounce appears with a finite probability ( in the example of figure  [ figprob ] , this probability has the value @xmath75 ) .",
    "let us briefly discuss the qualitative dependence of the bounce on the free parameters  @xmath64 , @xmath63 , @xmath24 , and  @xmath70 of our model ( for a detailed analysis we refer to  @xcite ) .",
    "first of all , the probability of preventing the crunch can be increased by choosing  @xmath76 smaller .",
    "this is shown in the example figure  [ fignocrunch ] , where the bounce occurs even with probability one .    ,",
    "@xmath65 and  @xmath77.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ] @xmath67 , @xmath65 and  @xmath77.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    we point out that small  @xmath76 does not imply that  @xmath64 is also small .",
    "namely , as one sees from the einstein equation in  ( [ bloch ] ) by setting  @xmath34 equal to zero , a small value of  @xmath76 can be compensated by choosing  @xmath39 or  @xmath24 large .",
    "this leaves us the freedom to choose  @xmath63 , ( [ rqudef ] ) , at will . in this way",
    ", one can construct space - times with a high probability of bouncing in the physically relevant case where  @xmath64 is the size of our universe and  @xmath63 is a microscopic length scale .    an interesting limiting case of our ed equations is obtained by dropping the first summand in  ( [ ddef ] ) .",
    "this is a good approximation in the so - called _ scale dominated region _ where  @xmath8 decreases so fast that the oscillations of  @xmath60 and  @xmath61 can be neglected . in particular , the scale dominated region describes the bounce in the physically interesting limit  @xmath78 ( for fixed  @xmath24 ) . in this limiting case",
    ", we can integrate the dirac equation in  ( [ bloch ] ) explicitly and express  @xmath79 as a function of @xmath8 , @xmath80 where @xmath81 + \\arctan[r(t_0)/r_{\\rm qu}]$ ] , and  @xmath82 is the time from which on the scale dominated approximation applies .",
    "for the probability  @xmath83 that the crunch is avoided one obtains @xmath84 this probability tends to  @xmath85 as  @xmath86 tends to infinity , showing that the bounce is of significance even for fixed  @xmath76 in an arbitrarily large universe .",
    "by iteratively adjusting the starting values at  @xmath87 , we constructed time - periodic solutions . in figure  [ figperiod ]",
    "an example of a time - periodic solution is shown . except near the `` quantum turning points '' between collapse and expansion ,",
    "the space - time is well - approximated by the classical dust - dominated frw universe .",
    "it is remarkable that the dominant energy condition is fulfilled even near the quantum turning points , as is shown on the right of figure  [ figperiod ] .",
    "we point out that the periodic solutions were constructed by fine - tuning the initial condition and are thus not generic .",
    "a generic solution collapses after a finite number of cycles .    , @xmath88 , @xmath89.,title=\"fig:\",width=245 ] , @xmath88 , @xmath89.,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ]",
    "a new class of solutions of the einstein equations coupled to dirac spinors was constructed .",
    "these solutions satisfy the dominant energy condition and are thus physically relevant .",
    "our model reveals in a simple and explicit setting a general mechanism which tends to avoid space - time singularities , such as the big bang or the big crunch , if the quantum mechanical nature of matter is taken into account . by fine - tuning the initial conditions our model even allows for periodic solutions , an eternal universe with an infinite number of cycles .",
