    "<S> our results suggest that the initial correlations of the rydberg ensemble should persist through the avalanche . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath4 is readily achieved , which has allowed the observation and driving of collective mechanical modes@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> reaching deep into the strongly - coupled regime , however , has remained out of reach partly due to disorder - induced - heating ( dih ) , where the coulomb interaction energy due to the initially random distribution of the atoms is converted into kinetic energy of the ions  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> gases of atoms in high - lying ( rydberg ) states offer an alternative approach to study ucps , as they can be easily ionized , and the strong rydberg - rydberg interactions lead to dramatic new effects . </S>",
    "<S> the spontaneous evolution of an attractively interacting rydberg gas into an ucp has been observed in several experiments@xcite , which initiated in - depth studies on the ionization mechanisms  @xcite and on the electron - ion recombination dynamics towards rydberg states@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> we observe , after a well defined but controllable time , a spontaneous avalanche ionization , as evidenced by a sudden increase in the number of detected ions , accompanied by a depletion of the ground and rydberg state populations . </S>",
    "<S> we identify the relevant processes leading to plasma formation , and using a simple coupled rate - equation model we quantify the relevant formation rates . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that repulsive interactions delay the onset of avalanche ionization , and lead to a density dependence which differs significantly from previous observations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate that the typical time - scale for plasma formation is short compared to the motional dynamics of the ions , suggesting that the initial correlations should be preserved in the plasma phase . </S>",
    "<S> the basic principle behind our observations can be understood in three main stages ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phyics_idea ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) an initially randomly distributed gas of ultracold neutral atoms is excited to rydberg states via a continuous two - photon laser coupling . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) due to the rydberg blockade , each rydberg - excited atom blocks further excitations within a radius @xmath8 leading to density - density correlations which resemble those of a gas of hard - spheres . after a short time </S>",
    "<S> , the rydberg density reaches steady state , however over time rydberg atoms start to decay by a combination of blackbody photoionization  @xcite and ionizing collisions with atoms in the ground and intermediate states @xcite , which leads to a gradual increase in the number of charged particles in the system . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) once a critical number of ions @xmath9 accumulates the resulting space charge can trap subsequently produced electrons . at this critical time @xmath10 , </S>",
    "<S> rapid electron - rydberg collisions trigger an ionization avalanche , leading to the formation of an ucp . since the avalanche is triggered by the fast moving electrons the plasma forms rapidly compared to the motion of the ions . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the original spatially ordered structure of the rydberg ensemble should be preserved . </S>",
    "<S> this is predicted to reduce the effects of dih by several orders of magnitude  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , after this sudden ionization of most of the rydberg ensemble , the continuous laser excitation feeds the avalanche until the ground state population is fully depleted .    in our experiments </S>",
    "<S> we measure simultaneously the atom number in the ground or intermediate state @xmath5 , the rydberg atom number @xmath6 , and the ion number @xmath7 in a small excitation volume through a combination of absorption imaging and ionization detection . </S>",
    "<S> our experimental setup is as follows : dense atomic samples of up to @xmath11 @xmath12rb atoms in the @xmath13 state are loaded into a single beam optical dipole trap . </S>",
    "<S> we hold the atoms in the trap for a short time to equilibrate at a temperature of @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> we then release the atoms , and let the cloud expand during a typical time - of - flight of @xmath15 to a radially symmetric gaussian distribution with @xmath16-radii of @xmath17 and @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the peak atomic density is varied between @xmath19 while maintaining an approximately constant cloud shape by reducing the overall atom number during trap loading .    </S>",

    "<S> @xmath26 expands by less than @xmath31 . to stop the excitation , we switch on an electric field which field ionizes the rydberg atoms and subsequently guides all ions to a micro - channel plate detector ( mcp ) .     </S>",

    "<S> the sharp evolution of @xmath5 is well reproduced , although the model does not completely reproduce @xmath6 and @xmath7 after the avalanche . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this to three - body recombination towards rydberg states counted in the detection process , and to plasma expansion , both not included in the model . </S>",
    "<S> the best fit parameters and uncertainties are : @xmath63 ; @xmath64 , a factor of 8 - 15 larger than the geometrical cross - section of the rydberg atoms ( @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the bohr radius and @xmath67 is the effective principal quantum number ) ; and @xmath68ev , i.e. approximately 60@xmath69 of the electron binding energy in @xmath20 , similarly to@xcite . given our geometry , @xmath61 relates to @xmath70 ( typically 5@xmath71 of the initial rydberg number ) , and to @xmath72  @xcite .    to investigate the regimes in which a plasma develops , we extracted @xmath10 from the data as a function of density ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> we observe a critical dependence , following an approximate power law of @xmath73 with @xmath74 on the considered density range . </S>",
    "<S> we have also studied the role of the excitation volume by performing experiments for a shorter time - of - flight of @xmath75s , which leads to a reduced volume @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the onset times are delayed , since @xmath9 decreases slower with @xmath26 than the total atom number@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is well reproduced by the model , when accounting for the new geometry with conserved rates and cross sections .    from the model </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the rydberg blockade has a significant effect on the formation of the ucp , delaying @xmath10 by typically 80@xmath69 for the data shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> in such a time , rydberg interactions are suspected to develop strong spatial correlations  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> , the ions only move by at most 600 nm , which is much less than their average spacing ( @xmath78 ) : thus , the correlations from the rydberg sample are most - likely preserved in the avalanche . </S>",
    "<S> the observed packing fraction @xmath79 is similar to the highest considered in @xcite : provided the laser couplings are turned off immediately after @xmath10 , we expect that the importance of dih as compared to final ion interactions should be strongly reduced .    to further study the effect of rydberg interactions on the avalanche dynamics , we compared the dynamics from different rydberg states , while keeping all other experimental parameters ( in particular @xmath80 ) approximately constant . in comparison to @xmath20 </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : density_dependence ] ) . rescaling the parameters @xmath84 ; @xmath85 ; and @xmath86 @xcite , the model accounts for approximately half of the relative shift in @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> this discrepancy could be due to a different scaling of the ionization cross - section @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> for the @xmath87 state we observe an immediate production of ions ( @xmath88 ) , presumably due to the anisotropy of d - state interactions which breaks the blockade effect and leads to an increased rate of ionizing rydberg  </S>",
    "<S> rydberg collisions @xcite .    * </S>",
    "<S> ( log - log scale ) . </S>",
    "<S> dark and light symbols correspond to experiments with excitation volumes @xmath26 and @xmath76 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> circles and triangles correspond to the @xmath20 and @xmath81 states , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> continuous lines are the model predictions for @xmath20 for both volumes , using the same parameters fitted on experiments in @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line shows the model outcome in @xmath26 when neglecting the blockade effect . ]    in conclusion , we have experimentally investigated the spontaneous evolution from a strongly blockaded and spatially correlated rydberg gas to an ucp . </S>",
    "<S> simultaneous absorption imaging and ion detection allow us to observe the complete dynamics of this process . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we identified a regime in which the ionization avalanche is faster than the motional timescale of the produced ions , suggesting a new route to the production of strongly coupled ucps with large ionic coupling parameters @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , rydberg states allow for a large tuning of the correlation length given by @xmath85 . future experiments could directly resolve the spatial structure of the resultant plasmas , for example by using atomic species with more than one valence electron  @xcite , or by using rydberg states as a sensitive probe  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . this would open promising new avenues to experimentally investigate novel effects in ucps , such as liquid - vapor phase coexistences , critical points  @xcite and strongly coupled liquid phases . </S>"
