    "the nature of the metal insulator transition in multi - band materials involving subbands of different widths is not yet fully understood . as a result of the geometric complexity of many transition metal oxides ,",
    "the degeneracy of valence bands is frequently lifted , giving rise to coexisting narrow and wide partially filled bands .",
    "a key issue in these materials is therefore whether these subbands exhibit separate mott transitions or whether single - particle hybridization among subbands and inter - orbital coulomb interactions ensure the occurrence of a single transition involving all subbands simultaneously .",
    "an example is the layer perovskite sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 which consists of a wide , two - dimensional @xmath2 band and narrow , nearly one - dimensional @xmath3 bands.@xcite this system is believed to exhibit unconventional p - wave superconductivity .",
    "@xcite iso - electronic replacement of sr by ca leads to a distortion of oxygen octahedra and an effective narrowing of the ru - derived @xmath4 bands , causing a metal insulator transition .",
    "@xcite another case is the layer compound na@xmath5coo@xmath0 which as a function of doping concentration exhibits a wide range of properties , including superconductivity ( when hydrated ) , while the parent material coo@xmath0 is an insulator.@xcite    in previous work @xcite we investigated the mott transition in ca@xmath6sr@xmath5ruo@xmath1 by considering a 3-band model appropriate for sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 and varying the on - site coulomb interaction rather than modifying the band width . extending earlier quasi - particle calculations for this system @xcite within the dynamical mean field theory@xcite ( dmft ) we found that inter - orbital coulomb interactions lead to a significant redistribution of spectral weight between @xmath4 orbitals . as a result , despite the completely different shapes and widths of the single - particle densities of states , for increasing @xmath7 the @xmath2 and @xmath3 subbands exhibit similar correlation features , suggesting the existence of a single mott transition .",
    "additional single - particle coupling between @xmath4 states caused by octahedral distortions @xcite undoubtedly will enhance the trend towards a single transition .",
    "this result was in conflict with dmft calculations by anisimov et al.@xcite who obtained a sequence of mott transitions as the on - site coulomb interaction was increased beyond the single - particle widths of the narrow and wide @xmath4 subbands of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , respectively .    to avoid the uncertainties stemming from the maximum entropy reconstruction @xcite of real - frequency spectra we recently considered a simple two - band model and focused on quantities directly available from the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) calculations carried out at imaginary times and frequencies .",
    "@xcite the subbands were assumed to have semi - circular density of states of widths @xmath8  ev , @xmath9  ev , to be each half - filled , and to interact only via local intra- and inter - orbital coulomb energies @xmath7 and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the hund s rule exchange integral .",
    "the quantum impurity calculations were performed within the dmft and multi - orbital qmc method for @xmath12  mev . for increasing @xmath7 and @xmath13 ( with fixed @xmath14  ev )",
    "the subband quasi - particle weights @xmath15 were found to vanish at about the same critical @xmath16 , within a characteristic uncertainty caused by critical slowing down .",
    "the same behavior was found for the quantities @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) which define the spectral weight of the coherent subband peaks within a few @xmath19 of @xmath20 . also , two - band calculations at @xmath21 within the iterated perturbation theory@xcite ( ipt ) supported the existence of a common transition .",
    "these results confirmed our previous finding , namely , that inter - subband coupling due to local coulomb interactions gives rise to a single mott transition rather than a sequence of orbital - selective transitions .",
    "recently koga et al.@xcite considered the same two - band hubbard model involving semi - circular densities of states with @xmath8  ev , @xmath9  ev and on - site coulomb interactions specified by @xmath22 . also assuming both subbands to be half - filled",
    ", they studied the effect due to larger hund s rule coupling by choosing @xmath23 and @xmath24 . to be able to reach lower temperatures ,",
    "the dmft calculations were performed within the exact diagonalization ( ed ) method @xcite and a linearized two - site version of the dmft.@xcite surprisingly , both impurity treatments indicate the existence of orbital - selective metal insulator transitions , i.e. , the narrow subband exhibits a smaller critical @xmath16 than the wide subband , implying a region of coexisting metallic and insulating subbands in spite of the inter - orbital coulomb interactions defined by @xmath13 and @xmath11 .",
    "the conflicting results obtained within these various approaches underline the subtle and complex nature of the mott transition in multi - orbital systems .",
    "since the non - isotropic multi - band character among transition metal oxide materials is the rule rather than an exception there is evidently a need to clarify this fundamental issue .",
    "further theoretical studies are required to test the reliability of the dmft method and various quantum impurity treatments .",
    "contradictory results for a rather simple model which nevertheless captures a key feature present in many real systems obviously shed doubts on predictions obtained for more complex materials .    in the present work we reconsider the same two - band hubbard model as in refs .  11 and 13 .",
    "since the qmc calculations are difficult to perform at low temperatures , we consider first the simpler iterated perturbation theory at finite @xmath25 .",
    "although this scheme is not reliable on a quantitative level , it can serve as a useful guide for qualitative purposes . at sufficiently low temperatures",
    ", the ipt reveals a single first - order transition for both subbands , confirming our previous results . because of the numerical simplicity of this model we are able to obtain the entire @xmath26 phase diagram .",
    "we then study the same model within the two - band qmc method .",
    "although convergence is considerably more difficult at low temperatures , these results also suggest a common mott transition . on the other hand ,",
    "the interpretation of this multi - band phase transition is complicated since in both phases the subbands exhibit quite different correlation features due to their different single - particle properties .",
    "thus , in the metallic phase , the narrow band is much more correlated than the wide band and shows a mixture of both metallic and insulating features .",
    "similarly , in the insulating phase the narrow band exhibits a gap while the wide band reveals pronounced bad - metal behavior .",
    "thus , the transition is partially incomplete for individual subbands .",
    "this complexity of the quasi - particle spectra , and the difficulty of clearly identifying metallic and insulating properties at finite temperatures , presumably is the origin of some of the contradictions between the previous works .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in the next section",

    "since we take both subbands to be half - filled we do not consider here corrections to the bare second - order self - energy which should be introduced in the absence of particle - hole symmetry .",
    "@xcite at half - filling , the first - order hartree - fock terms are identical for both bands , @xmath42 , and can be absorbed by the chemical potential . throughout this paper",
    "we assume @xmath23 and @xmath24 , unless noted otherwise .",
    "the self - energies @xmath31 are now inserted in eq.(1 ) and the procedure is iterated until self - consistency is achieved .",
    "the starting self - energy is taken to be zero .",
    "in particular at low temperatures , the direct and inverse fourier transforms must be done with sufficient accuracy.@xcite also , at each iteration the symmetry condition @xmath35 is enforced to remove spurious effects due to numerical inaccuracies .",
    "this ensures that the @xmath31 remain purely imaginary as they should be for symmetric half - filled bands .",
    "typically @xmath43 time slices and @xmath44 matsubara frequencies were used .",
    "also , the real-@xmath45 integration in eq.(1 ) must be performed on a rather fine mesh in order to capture the narrow coherent peak close to the metal insulator transition .",
    "this can be achieved by linearly interpolating @xmath46 and performing the @xmath45 integral analytically between mesh points .",
    "once a converged solution is found , the green s functions @xmath47 are used to generate the fourier transforms @xmath48 from which the quasi - particle spectra at real frequencies are derived via the maximum entropy method.@xcite    -3 mm    -3 mm    -3 mm    -3 mm    figures 1 to 4 show the variation of the subband quasi - particle weights @xmath49 $ ] as functions of @xmath7 for various temperatures .",
    "up to @xmath50  ev the results show the typical hysteresis behavior obtained also for the single - band hubbard model.@xcite if @xmath7 is gradually increased from the metallic side the transition occurs at a slightly larger critical value than if one begins in the insulating phase and gradually decreases @xmath7 .",
    "the hysteresis is most pronounced at low temperatures and becomes weaker as @xmath25 increases . for @xmath51",
    "ev it is negligibly small and the transition begins to resemble the typical cross - over behavior .",
    "the important point of these results is that the quasi - particle weights of the narrow and wide subbands exhibit first - order transitions at precisely the same critical @xmath52 .",
    "this picture supports our previous results suggesting a single mott transition in a non - isotropic multi - orbital environment , in contrast to the orbital selective transitions found in refs .  9 and 11 .",
    "in line with the notation used in the single - band case , we denote the common critical value for decreasing @xmath7 as @xmath53 and for increasing @xmath7 as @xmath54 .",

    "ev finite temperature broadening progressively dominates the transition region .",
    "figure 5 shows the phase diagram obtained from the functions @xmath57 .",
    "the overall shape of the phase boundaries agrees well with those obtained for the single - band hubbard model.@xcite according to the single - band phase diagram , the actual first - order metal insulator transition takes place along an intermediate line @xmath52 such that @xmath58 ( schematically indicated by the dashed curve ) .",
    "extrapolation of the phase boundaries suggests a common transition temperature of about @xmath59  ev .",
    "this value agrees well with the average between the critical temperatures derived for isotropic narrow and wide two - band systems , @xmath60  ev and @xmath61  ev , respectively .",
    "[ in the single band case the ipt - dmft yields @xmath62 .",
    "@xcite according to eq.(3 ) , for doubly degenerate bands and @xmath63 , this value should be reduced by a factor @xmath64 . ]",
    "although inter - orbital coulomb interactions lead to a common metal insulator transition in the narrow and wide subbands , it is clear from figs .  1 to 4 that the subband quasi - particle weights differ greatly both in the metallic and insulating phases . in this sense",
    ", the subband transitions are partly incomplete : on the metallic side , @xmath65 is consistently smaller than @xmath66 because of the more pronounced correlations within the narrow band . as as result , as will be discussed below , this band can exhibit quasi - insulating behavior .",
    "conversely , on the insulating side of the transition , @xmath65 drops almost to zero while @xmath66 drops to a finite intermediate value and gradually decreases towards larger @xmath7 .",
    "this ` bad - metal ' behavior of the wide band above the transition is weak at low temperatures but becomes more important towards @xmath67 .",
    "there is no indication of a second first - order transition in the wide subband at larger @xmath7 .    to analyze the subband quasi - particle properties close to the transition in more detail we show in fig .",

    "the narrow band exhibits significant deviations from this linear behavior . only at the two lowest frequencies @xmath71 is roughly linear in @xmath72 . at larger frequencies it becomes inversely proportional to @xmath72 .",
    "thus , this band is in the intermediate region between metallic and insulating behavior , exhibiting a narrow coherent peak near @xmath20 nearly separated from pronounced hubbard bands ( see below ) . at @xmath73  ev , i.e. , just above the transition",
    ", the narrow band has become fully insulating with @xmath74 .",
    "in contrast , @xmath75 approaches a constant in the limit of small @xmath72 .",
    "thus , the wide band still is in the intermediate range between metallic and insulating behavior .",
    "these results demonstrate that in the vicinity of the mott transition the two subbands exhibit a complicated superposition of different cross - over behaviors as they switch between the metallic and insulating phases .",
    "the effect of these subband dependent correlations on the quasi - particle spectra is illustrated in fig .  7 for @xmath76",
    "ev just below and above @xmath53 . on the metallic side ,",
    "the wide band is perfectly metallic .",
    "the narrow band exhibits a very narrow coherent peak near @xmath20 and nearly vanishing weight between this peak and the large hubbard peaks.@xcite thus , the narrow band shows features indicative of both metallic and insulating behavior .",
    "similarly , above the transition the coherent peak in @xmath77 has vanished and a narrow excitation gap is visible .",
    "@xmath78 , on the other hand , still has appreciable spectral weight near the fermi energy . according to the phase diagram , at sufficiently low temperatures the true first - order line @xmath52 approaches the boundary @xmath54 . in fact , within a consistent dynamical two - site approximation @xcite @xmath52 is only slightly smaller than @xmath54 .",
    "1 shows that near this line the ` bad - metal ' character of the wide subband above the transition is much weaker than close to @xmath53 .",
    "the above results suggest that , although there is a single metal insulator transition for both subbands , slightly below and above this transition the quasi - particle spectra are rather complicated , partially exhibiting ` coexisting ' metallic and insulating behavior .",
    "in fact , in the range @xmath79  ev  @xmath80 , the transition in the wide band might be more appropriately described as metal / bad - metal transition . however",
    ", this behavior is associated with the fact that at finite @xmath25 there is no clear distinction between metal and insulator .",
    "extrapolation of the results shown in figs .",
    "1 to 4 to even lower temperatures suggests that the ` bad - metal ' behavior in the wide band above @xmath54 eventually disappears and that the gaps in both bands open simultaneously at the same critical @xmath52 .    before closing this section",
    "we briefly address the effect of the hund s rule exchange coupling on the correlations within the two - band hubbard model .",
    "the relatively large value assumed so far , @xmath23 , gives rise to considerable anisotropy and is partly the origin of the qualitative differences between the subbands , in particular near the transition .",
    "the reason for these differences can be understood in terms of the self - energy expression given in eq .",
    "( 3 ) . for @xmath23 : @xmath81 while for @xmath82 : @xmath83 .",
    "near the fermi level the single - particle density of states scales with the band width , i.e. , @xmath84 before the coulomb interaction is switched on .",
    "thus for @xmath23 , @xmath85 one finds : @xmath86 whereas for @xmath82 : @xmath87 .",
    "the subband contributions to the self - energy therefore differ significantly for @xmath23 , but they are quite similar for @xmath82 , giving rise to much more isotropic behavior .    fig .",
    "8 shows the quasi - particle weights @xmath15 as functions of @xmath7 for @xmath82 at @xmath68  ev . the comparison with fig .",
    "2 demonstrates that as a result of the greater isotropy of the system the correlation induced reduction of quasi - particle weight is now quite similar for both subbands . in particular , slightly below and above the transition both bands",
    "show similar metallic and insulating behavior , respectively , in contrast to the much more complex superposition of quasi - metallic and -insulating behavior obtained for @xmath23 . as before ,",
    "both bands undergo a first - order metal insulator transition at the same critical @xmath7 .",
    "since there is neither single - particle hybridization nor hund s rule coupling between subbands , the common transition is entirely caused by the inter - orbital coulomb interaction @xmath88 . without this interaction ,",
    "we would have @xmath89 ( slight differences arise as long as the temperature is held fixed ) .",
    "thus , the critical coulomb energies of the subbands would differ by the same factor as the band widths @xmath90 .",
    "8 shows that @xmath13 enforces a single transition at an intermediate @xmath16 . as in fig .  2 , the @xmath15 exhibit similar hysteresis behavior : for decreasing @xmath7 the critical coulomb energy is @xmath91  ev while for increasing @xmath7 we find @xmath92  ev .",

    "while @xmath65 drops almost to zero near @xmath99  ev @xmath66 drops to a finite value and then decreases gradually towards larger @xmath7 .",
