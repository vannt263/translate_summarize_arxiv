    "the formulation of photon - counting theory in the frame of quantum electrodynamics @xcite gave birth to modern quantum optics .",
    "recent progress in physics of ultracold atoms made possible to develop and apply techniques of single atom counting to various systems . since the pioneering experiments of shimizu @xcite , spectacular measurements of hanbury brown - twiss effect for bosons @xcite , and fermions @xcite have been performed with ultra - cold meta - stable helium atoms .",

    "these new detection methods allow in principle to measure full atom - counting distributions with spatial resolution ( by counting only atoms in a certain spatial region ) , and provide novel efficient ways of detection of strongly correlated systems @xcite .",
    "equally spectacular progress has been achieved in spin - counting , or in other words , measurements of total atomic spin for atoms with spin , or pseudo - spin degree of freedom .",

    "we show how the atom counting techniques can be used to detect properties of strongly correlated systems .",
    "we concentrate , in particular , on the case of fermion and/or spin counting in one - dimensional ( 1d ) optical lattices , that are equivalent , via jordan - wigner transformation @xcite , to 1d spin chains .",
    "the problem of spin counting for a local block of spins in the 1d ising model in a transverse field has been considered in a beautiful work of demler s group @xcite .",

    "second , employing ideas of ref .",
    "@xcite , we calculate not only the counting distribution for the total fermion number ( total @xmath2-spin component ) , but also for  effective \" number , corresponding to certain spatial fourier components of the fermion density . while for the considered family of models , counting distributions are always smooth , their cumulants exhibit critical behavior , evident even for small detection efficiencies .",
    "the distributions are always sub - poissonian , but the sub - poissonian character changes , as we sweep @xmath1 from 0 to @xmath3 . for small ( large ) @xmath0 ,",
    "the @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) distribution is always the narrower ( broader ) one . through the paper ,",
    "we use an elegant generalization of the photon - counting theory to fermions , derived by cahill and glauber within the formalism of grassmann variables @xcite . for the cases we consider , we obtain analytic expressions for the counting distribution in terms of simple recursion relations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec_model ] , we briefly describe the models of the 1d optical lattice that we consider , and the jordan - wigner transformation that can be used to diagonalize them . in the next section ( sec . [ sec_counting ] )",
    ", we derive the counting statistics of fermions in the systems described by these models ; in particular , we discuss them for the ising model ( subsec .",
    "[ sec_ising ] ) , and more generally for the asymmetric xy model ( subsec . [ sec_xy ] ) . in subsec .",
    "[ sec_mean_variance ] , we consider the means and variances of the counting distributions : we derive recurrence relations that allow for easy calculation of these moments for an arbitrary number of particles in the system .",
    "we discuss also the generalization of our method to the case of fourier components of the total spin in subsec .",
    "[ sec_ditiyo ] .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in sec .",
    "[ sec_obosesh ] .",
    "let us consider a family of models describing an one - dimensional fermi gas in an optical lattice , described by the hamiltonian @xmath6+\\frac{1}{2}ng,\\label{eq - ham1}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the energy associated to fermion tunneling , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the number of sites .",
    "one way to realize such hamiltonian with ultracold atoms is to use a fermi - bose mixture in the strong coupling limit . in this limit",
    ", the low energy physics is well described by fermionic composites theory @xcite , in which fermions form composite objects with @xmath10 bosons , or bosonic holes repectively .",
    "the fermionic composites undergo tunneling and interact via nearest neighbor interactions , which may be repulsive or attractive , weak or strong , depending on the original parameters of the system , such as scattering lengths , etc . in the case of weak attractive interactions ,",
    "the system undergoes , at zero temperature , a transition into a `` @xmath11-wave '' superfluid , described well by the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory , corresponding exactly to the hamiltonian ( [ eq - ham1 ] ) .      using jordan - wigner transformation @xcite",
    ", one can transform the hamiltonian ( [ eq - ham1 ] ) into the one of a 1d asymmetric xy spin chain in the transverse magnetic field @xmath1 , @xmath12 s_j^z\\right ] , \\label{eq - xy}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 are the spin @xmath14 operators at site @xmath15 , proportional to pauli matrices .",
    "the special cases @xmath16 ( i.e. the so called symmetric xy , or xx limit ) and @xmath17 can be realized with single species bosons in the hard core ( i.e. strongly repulsive ) bosons limit @xcite , or in a chain of double well sites filled with bosons interacting via weak dipolar forces @xcite , respectively . in general , one should use a two component bose - bose and fermi - fermi mixture , which , in the strong coupling limit , and in the mott insulator state with one atom per site , is described by an asymmetric ( xxz ) heisenberg model ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) in the z oriented field . by appropriate tuning of the scattering lengths via feshbach resonances , one can set the @xmath18 coupling to zero , i.e. achieve the xx model in the transverse field . in order to introduce the asymmetry @xmath0 , one",
    "should additionally introduce tunneling assisted with a laser or microwave induced double spin flip .",
    "for this aim , one should make use of the resonance between on - site two atom `` up - up '' and `` down - down '' states , without disturbing `` up - down '' configurations .",
    "as it is well known , jordan - wigner transformation works for open chains , and in particular for an infinite chain",
    ". we will nevertheless assume periodic boundary conditions to solve the fermion model ( [ eq - ham1 ] ) using fourier and bogoliubov transformations ( see e.g. @xcite ) . for large @xmath9 ,",
    "such precedure gives the right leading behaviour .",
    "we define fourier transformed operators as @xmath19 and @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "we perform then the bogoliubov transforms @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 are real numbers satisfying @xmath25 so that we can write @xmath26 when @xmath27 the hamiltonian reduces then to the noninteracting fermions hamiltonian , @xmath28 with @xmath29 the ground state is thus the vacuum of the @xmath30 operators .",
    "for @xmath31 the spectrum is everywhere gapped , except at the critical point @xmath32 . for",
    "@xmath33 , @xmath30 s coincide with @xmath34 s or @xmath35 s , and the ground state is a fermi sea .",
    "for @xmath36 the spectrum is then gapless and the system critical .",
    "note that the number of original fermions @xmath37 , as well as the the total z - component of the spin , @xmath38 are not conserved , except at @xmath33 .",
    "let us now turn to counting procedures .",
    "for the case of fermions , one should think about the analogue approach as one used in the experiments on metastable helium . for spins",
    ", one could use directly qndps to measure the distribution of @xmath39 , or even its spatially resolved version @xcite . an alternative way would be to switch off the hamiltonian ( [ eq - xy ] ) ( by switching off lasers ) , and induce spontaneous raman transition from the state `` up '' to some side level .",
    "counting of spontaneously emitted photons would correspond then to counting of `` up '' spins ",
    "mathematically , as known for photons @xcite , and generalized by cahill and glauber for fermions @xcite , the probability of detecting @xmath40 photons in a given interval of time can be expressed as the @xmath40th derivative with respect to a parameter @xmath41 of the generating function @xmath42 as @xmath43 where @xmath42 is the expectation value of a normally ordered exponential @xmath44 .",
    "the operator @xmath45 is a space - time integral of the product of the positive - frequency and negative - frequency parts of the quantum fields describing particles to be counted .",
    "the mean values of normally ordered products can be calculated in a particularly convenient and elegant way using the grassmann variables formalism , introduced in @xcite . in the case of counting the total number of particles , we have @xmath46 , where @xmath47 , while @xmath48 is the detector efficiency , and @xmath49 is the exposure time .",
    "for the spatially resolved qndps , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the wave vector of the standing wave used for detection , and @xmath52 is the position of the @xmath15-th site .    for counting the total number of particles ,",
    "the generating function @xmath53 can be written as @xmath54 the operators @xmath55 commute for different @xmath56 , so that the expression for @xmath57 can be rewritten as @xmath58 as @xmath59 , etc .",
    "the terms @xmath55 and @xmath60 can then be expressed in terms of the @xmath61 fermions : @xmath62      we consider the counting statistics of the @xmath63 fermions in the ground state of the hamiltonian , i.e. _ in the vacuum state of @xmath61 fermions_.    the trace in the generating function can be now easily calculated by the formalism of grassmann variables @xcite . the @xmath64 representation for the density operator @xmath65 is @xmath66 where @xmath67 are the fermionic coherent states , as defined in @xcite . using the @xmath64 representation , the mean values of normally ordered products of @xmath61-fermions",
    "can then be calculated as @xmath68 where the @xmath69 are grassmann variables , and are defined by the eigen - equation @xmath70 . for the vacuum state of the @xmath61-fermions ,",
    "@xmath71 the @xmath64-function is given by @xmath72 evaluating eq .",
    "( [ eq - trace ] ) using eq .",
    "( [ eq - p ] ) , we get the relations @xmath73 and @xmath74 the relevant remaining terms in the product @xmath75 in the generating function are thus @xmath76 elementary calculations using the relations ( [ normalordering ] ) and ( [ qwert ] ) yield @xmath77 at this point it is convenient to introduce the distribution function @xmath78 of counting @xmath40 particles for @xmath79 pairs of modes . it is given by the same expression as before , but with the product in eq .",
    "( [ eq - q ] ) limited to @xmath80 terms .",
    "the counting distribution is calculated from the generating function by the relation in eq .",
    "( [ eq - p ] ) .",
    "we use the generalized leibniz rule , @xmath81 where the generalized newton s symbol is given by @xmath82 to derive a recurrence relation , to calculate the distribution for @xmath83 modes , given the distribution for @xmath79 modes .",
    "the distribution function @xmath78 for @xmath79 modes is given by @xmath84 where the summations run over @xmath85 such that @xmath86 , where @xmath87 , @xmath88 , or @xmath89 , for @xmath90 .",
    "we can now derive the recursive relation @xmath91 where @xmath92 are the probabilities of detecting 0,1 , or 2 particles in the modes @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "therefore , starting from @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , we can use the recurrence relation ( [ asol_jinis ] ) to calculate the counting distribution for an arbitrary number of modes .",
    "let us turn now to our results and discuss the counting statistics for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "in the figures that we plot below ( except in fig .",
    "[ fig - splitting ] in subsec .",
    "[ sec_split ] ) , we choose a value of the total number of modes , @xmath9 , such that the corresponding quantities ( distribution , mean , variance , etc . )",
    "have already converged . in the cases that we consider ,",
    "such convergence occurs for @xmath98 .",
    "the counting distributions for the transverse ising model ( transverse xy model with @xmath99 ) for two exemplary values of the field parameter @xmath8 are shown in fig .",
    "[ comaparison ] .",
    "the ising model has a quantum phase transtition at @xmath100 @xcite , and one exemplary value of @xmath101 is chosen below the qpt , and the other above it .",
    "the difference in behavior is clearly seen .",
    "( @xmath102 and @xmath103 denote the mean and variance of the distribution , respectively . ) below , it will be more clearly revealed by looking at the mean and the variance of the distribution .      in fig .",
    "[ comaparison1 ] , we plot counting distributions as a function of @xmath104 for four values of @xmath0 , for a fixed value of the efficiency @xmath105 , and for two extreme values of @xmath101 : @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "note that all the distributions presented in fig .",
    "[ comaparison1 ] are smooth and their widths ( @xmath108 ) are of order of 0.01 .",
    "since , as we argue below , @xmath109 , all the distributions are sub- poissonian , because @xmath110 , despite the finite detection efficiency . for @xmath111 ,",
    "the distribution for @xmath106 is narrower than that for @xmath112 .",
    "this tendency is inverted in the ising model , when the distribution for @xmath106 has a _",
    "larger _ variance than the one for @xmath113 . at , what we call , _ transition anisotropy _",
    "@xmath114 , the distributions for @xmath115 and @xmath112 practically coincide .",
    "this transition anisotropy depends on the efficiency @xmath116 , and it moves to @xmath111 , as @xmath117 .",
    "this indicates that the probability distribution of counting can distinguish the two universality classes ( the xx , with @xmath33 , and the ising , with @xmath118 ) among the xy models on a chain . in the limit of @xmath119 , only the model with @xmath111",
    "has lower variance for @xmath106 as compared to @xmath107 , while all the other xy models ( with @xmath120 ) have the opposite behavior .      in order to understand the properties of counting distributions better ,",
    "we look at the mean and variance , which can be calculated from the following recurrences : @xmath121 since @xmath122 and @xmath123 can be trivially calculated , the mean and variance can be obtained by these relations for an arbitrary number of modes .",
    "the recurrences imply that the mean @xmath124 ; we find typical value of @xmath125 indeed of order of @xmath126 . on the other hand , the variance @xmath127 .",
    "both quantities show singular behavior in the thermodynamical limit at criticality . in particular , for the transverse ising model ( @xmath128 ) , near the critical point @xmath129 , the mean @xmath102 can be written in terms of elliptic integrals of first and second kind , and can be expressed as @xcite @xmath130 so that @xmath131 since all models with @xmath120 belong to the same universality class , they all present the same singular behavior @xcite .",
    "this is contrasted with the case of xx model , which belongs to a different universality class . the singular behavior is clearly seen in the plots of @xmath132 and @xmath133 obtained for finite @xmath134 and ideal @xmath135 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - gammas ] ) . for finite values of @xmath0",
    ", the variance shows a jump in the first derivative , while the first derivative of the mean tends to  infinity \" at @xmath136 .",
    "this behavior is better seen , when one plots directly the derivatives of @xmath102 and @xmath103 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - gammasderivatives ] ) .",
    "this behavior changes drastically as @xmath137 .",
    "the variance tends then to zero ( in the symmetric xx model the particle number is conserved ) , and the mean has a diverging derivative for @xmath138 , and is constant for @xmath139 .",
    "amazingly , although finite detector efficiency obviously smoothes out the curves , the signatures of the singularities are clearly visible even for @xmath140 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - means - variances ] ) . a clear change of behavior of the curves is visible even at @xmath141 !",
    "note , that in all considered cases so far , the variance @xmath142 , i.e. all distributions are sub - poissonian .",
    "note , however , that going from anti - ferromagnetic to the _ ferromagnetic _ case , does not affect the variance , but replaces @xmath143 . in that case",
    "we do observe a transition from sub - poissonian behavior at small @xmath144 , to ( weakly ) super - poissonian for @xmath145 ; the value of @xmath146 tend to @xmath136 from below as @xmath147 .",
    "the bogoliubov transformation used to solve the considered models can be regarded as a `` squeezing '' or `` pairing '' transformation .",
    "the ground state that we investigated is analogous to bcs states of semiconductors , i.e. they involve fermion ( cooper - like ) pairs .",
    "thus , in the ideal case of @xmath135 , the counting distributions are exactly zero for odd numbers of particles . in practice , for finite values of @xmath9 and @xmath148 , the distributions oscillate between larger values for even , and small for odd number of counts .",
    "this behavior is very strongly affected by @xmath148 , since at finite efficiency , one may easily miss single atoms from the cooper pairs , and obtain odd counts . in effect , for a given value of @xmath9 , the even - odd asymmetry is visible only for @xmath116 close enough to 1 .",
    "similarly , the even - odd asymmetry is strongly affected by the finite size effects - for a given value of @xmath148 it is visible only for @xmath9 small enough ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - splitting ] ) .      finally , let us point out that the methods proposed in @xcite allow for measurements of various kinds of fourier components of the total spin ; in terms of particle counting , these methods allow for instance to count particles in every second , every third site , etc .",
    "our theory is easily generalized to such situations .    in the case",
    "when we count every second @xmath63 fermion , we have to express @xmath149 in terms of the @xmath61 fermions .",
    "as before , as a first step we do the fourier transform : @xmath150 the expression @xmath151 can thus be written as @xmath152 which is non vanishing for @xmath153 or @xmath154 .",
    "finally @xmath155 we can now calculate @xmath42 as follows : @xmath156    after performing the bogoliubov transform , and keeping the relevant terms for the vacuum state of the @xmath61 fermions , the generating function @xmath57 is given by @xmath157 which is in the same form as in eq .",
    "( [ eq - q ] ) , with the product restricted , however , to @xmath158 terms .",
    "we then easily derive analogous recurrences as in the cases considered so far .",
    "[ fig - means - variances - sec ] show the behavior of the mean and the variance , when counting every second spin , in the transverse ising model .",
    "note that the traces of singular behavior at @xmath159 persist .",
    "what is perhaps more interesting is that the general behavior is more rich .",
    "in particular , there is a crossing from sub- to super - possoinian behavior at @xmath160 . for @xmath111 the point of crossing moves to zero , and",
    "the variance disappears .",
    "summarizing , we have formulated and applied fermion and spin counting theory to a family of one - dimensional strongly correlated systems that can be realized and detected with ultracold atoms . the counting distributions exhibit traces of singularities at criticality , that persist even at low detection efficiencies .",
    "they show various kinds of rich behavior , such as transitions from sub- to super - poissonian character and even - odd oscillations .",
