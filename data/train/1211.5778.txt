    "radio sources in the centres of distant galaxies have both historical and current significance as beacons which indicate high - energy processes in high - redshift sources .",
    "they are also thought to be important in the life - cycle of galaxies because they may regulate the processes of star - formation by periodic ejection of gas from the central regions of the galaxy ( e.g. bower et al .",
    "2006 ; croton et al .",
    "2006 ; best et al . 2006 ; best & heckman 2012 ; cattaneo et al .",
    "much effort has been devoted to studying radio source populations in order to understand the physical processes in , and space distributions of , the different types of active galactic nucleus ( agn ) which host them . for most radio sources with fluxes of more than a few hundreds of @xmath0jy , jet emission associated with",
    "an agn is likely to be the dominant contribution to the radio flux density .",
    "a transition occurs at this level ( richards et al . 2000 ; muxlow et al .",
    "1999 , padovani et al . 2009 ) ; in fainter radio quasars , examples of which can now be detected to intrinsic flux densities of @xmath1jy ( e.g. jackson 2011 ) , synchrotron emission associated with stellar processes takes over ( e.g. padovani et al . 2011 ) .",
    "the structures of radio sources in agn typically include a core , coincident with the centre of the host galaxy , and jets , which extend from the core and terminate in hotspots , which are in turn surrounded by more diffuse extended emission known as lobes .",
    "however , the detailed structures are very diverse for several reasons .",
    "first , the presence of prominent hotspots is associated with high - power radio sources , the so - called friis ( fanaroff & riley 1974 ) , whereas lower - power fri sources show extended jet / lobe structure which becomes less bright with distance along the jet and do not have prominent hotspots .",
    "second , the cores of radio sources contain components which exhibit superluminal motion , implying that ejection is taking place at relativistic speeds .",
    "this affects particularly our view of a source whose ejection axis is close to the line of sight , because in this case the core will appear much more dominant because of relativistic doppler boosting .",
    "we will then see core radio emission which is stronger than the other extended components of the source ( hotspots and lobes ) which do not move at relativistic speeds .",
    "this leads to a powerful selection effect , in that we will observe intrinsically faint , apparently core - dominated radio sources which are beamed into flux - limited samples by this relativistic boosting effect .",
    "this suggests that the ratio of the core to extended radio flux , @xmath2 is usually defined as the ratio of core- to lobe- flux density in the emitted frame of the object at 5ghz , with the necessary @xmath3-correction carried out using a spectral index of 0 for the core and @xmath4 for the lobe emission .",
    "] , can be used as at least a crude orientation indicator , with higher values of @xmath2 corresponding to jet ejection angles close to the line of sight .",
    "such `` unified schemes '' of radio sources were developed 30 years ago ( blandford & rees 1974 ; orr & browne 1982 ; kapahi & saikia 1982 ; jackson & wall 1999 ) .",
    "subsequently they were modified to incorporate the idea ( peacock 1987 , scheuer 1987 , barthel 1989 ) that quasars represent a preferentially oriented population whose parent population , closer to the sky plane , consists of radio galaxies .",
    "radio galaxies , although similar in appearance to frii lobe - dominated radio quasars , do not have strong broad emission lines , and this is postulated to happen because their broad emission - line regions are hidden behind a torus - shaped obscuring component , in a similar manner to the presumed distinction between seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies . the boundary between quasars and radio galaxies",
    "is thought to correspond to an orientation of the outflow axis of approximately 45@xmath5 to the line of sight , based on statistics of the 3c sample .    as part of these developments , it is natural to ask what the properties of the different type of radio source would be in other wavebands , and whether these can also be explained by the operation of unified schemes .",
    "a number of correlations between radio properties and optical structure were found .",
    "for example , the width of the h@xmath6 line is generally larger for low-@xmath2 objects , as might be expected if the line is emitted from a disk whose axis lies along the ejection axis ( wills & browne 1986 ) .",
    "browne & murphy ( 1987 , hereafter bm87 ) developed this model to incorporate anisotropic optical and x - ray continuum emission , postulating that some fraction of the continuum is beamed , or at least anisotropic .",
    "provided that the narrow emission lines ( e.g. [ oiii ] ) of quasars are approximately isotropically emitted , their equivalent width should be lower in high-@xmath2 objects because the optical continuum in such objects would be expected to be relatively stronger .",
    "this was indeed found by jackson et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and jackson & browne ( 1991 ) in a sample of bright radio quasars for which good radio maps and optical spectra were available . in this work , [ oiii ]",
    "line strengths of core- and lobe - dominated quasars were matched between quasars of similar extended radio power , to remove possible luminosity effects . in samples",
    "not so matched ( boroson & oke 1984 ; boroson , persson & oke 1985 ; fine , jarvis & mauch 2011 ) the lobe - dominated quasars tend to have more luminous [ oiii ] but even if this effect is not due to a secondary correlation it is smaller than the differences in equivalent width that we consider here .",
    "an alternative / additional hypothesis is that the optical continuum in quasars is affected by aspect - dependent extinction ( baker 1997 , but see also fine , jarvis & mauch 2011 ) which causes the optical continuum of low-@xmath2 objects , which are seen at a larger angle to the line of sight , to be relatively obscured compared to high-@xmath2 objects , or that the continuum emission source is itself arranged in a flattened disk - like structure .",
    "risaliti , salvati & marconi ( 2011 ) have analysed the distribution of [ oiii ]  equivalent widths in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , abazajian et al .",
    "2009 ) quasar sample ( schneider et al . 2010 , shen et al . 2011 ) and find that the distribution is consistent with that expected from anisotropic continuum emission .",
    "modifications of this model can be made to explain differences in optical spectra as a function of source power .",
    "for example , `` receding - torus '' models ( lawrence 1991 ; simpson 1998 ; grimes , rawlings & willott 2004 ) propose that the opening angle of obscuring material around the agn becomes smaller as the objects become intrinsically less powerful .",
    "recently kimball et al . ( 2011a , b , hereafter k11a , k11b ) have analysed a large sample of radio sources selected from the sdss quasar sample ( schneider et al .",
    "of the original sample of optical quasars , they isolate a sample of 4714 quasars with significant detections in the first 1.4-ghz radio survey ( becker et al .",
    "1995 ) . of these ,",
    "a significant minority of 619 objects have radio extents large enough to be resolved by visual inspection into a core and two lobes ( `` triple sources '' ) , and a further 387 into a core coincident with the quasar and a single other component , assumed to be a lobe ( `` lobe sources '' ) .",
    "we will adopt the same terminology throughout the paper .",
    "having flux densities for both a core and lobe(s ) allows the @xmath2 parameter to be determined and , together with the published sdss spectra , yields plots of equivalent widths of a range of emission lines against @xmath2 .",
    "no correlations are found which are significant at 3@xmath7 , although in table 8 of k11b just for the `` lobe '' sources the anti - correlation between ew[oiii ]  and @xmath2 is significant at the 2.8@xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) level , thus apparently consistent with the earlier results by jackson et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and jackson & browne ( 1991 ) .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the expected correlations of emission line properties with radio structure , first comparing the small , but well characterized , jackson et al .",
    "( 1989 ) sample with the much larger k11a sample .",
    "we begin in section 2 by direct comparison of the data from the original sample with the new data from the sdss . in section 3",
    "we describe the approach of using simulations to quantify selection effects in the sample and try to assess the degree to which these effects affect the observed correlations . in section 4",
    "we discuss the distribution of radio structures within the sample . in section 5 ,",
    "given our knowledge of the selection effects we use the surviving correlation to investigate the range of models which are still compatible with the data by considering the extent to which the properties of the simulated and real samples are consistent with each other . throughout the paper",
    "we assume a flat cosmology with @xmath9km@xmath10s@xmath11mpc@xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the original sample of jackson et al .",
    "( 1989 ) consisted exclusively of bright radio objects , typically having flux densities of few hundred mjy at ghz frequencies , unlike the k11a sample which contains objects with flux densities @xmath13mjy . on the other hand",
    ", high - resolution ( normally sub - arcsecond ) radio maps were available in the smaller sample , compared to the much lower resolution ( 5-arcsecond ) maps available with first .",
    "we can assess the effect of this difference in resolution by examining the first data for the jackson et al . sample .",
    "of the 26 sources from this sample within the first footprint , 13 are found in the dr5 version of the sdss quasar catalogue , which had less complete sky coverage than more recent versions of the catalogue but which we use throughout this paper for compatibility with k11a . of these , only five are visible as resolved sources in the first catalogue , one knotty source ( b1217 + 023 ) , three triples ( b1004 + 130 , b1028 + 313 , b1512 + 370 ) and one lobe ( b1111 + 408 ) . of the four triple and lobe sources , the derived @xmath2 values for three are in very close agreement .",
    "the fourth , b1111 + 408=3c254 , is very discrepant ; for this source , @xmath14=@xmath15 according to jackson et al . , but table 2 of k11a lists this source as having a core flux density of 2004  mjy and an extended flux density of 1030  mjy .",
    "examination of high - resolution radio maps reveals that the former is correct , and that the origin of the discrepancy is that this source has a very asymmetric structure , with one lobe close to the core ( owen & puschell 1984 ; saikia et al . ,",
    "1990 ) . on the lower resolution",
    "first images , this lobe appears as part of the core , leading to an overestimate by a factor of @xmath16100 of the @xmath2 value , thus incorrectly leading to its classification as a core - dominated radio source .",
    "most of the sdss quasars in the jackson et al .",
    "sample , however , do not appear amongst the sources used in the k11a analysis .",
    "this is because they have such small angular extents that they appear as single sources in first .",
    "this unfortunately tends to selectively exclude the more core - dominated radio sources ; of the seven core - dominated radio sources from the jackson et al .",
    "sample which are both in first and sdss - dr5 , only one appears as a resolved source in the catalogue of k11a . to illustrate this , in fig .",
    "[ compare ] we show the anti - correlation between [ oiii ]  equivalent width and log@xmath2 for the jackson et al . data and highlight the objects with measured @xmath2 values from first .",
    "the @xmath2 values have been corrected to the emitted frame at 5ghz assuming a spectral index of @xmath17 , where @xmath18 .",

    "( 1989 ) ( circles ) with the same sample whose @xmath2 values have instead been calculated from the first data ( crosses ) .",
    "only four objects are resolved by the first data , one of which has an @xmath2 value affected by blending of the core with one lobe ; these four are plotted as filled circles from higher - resolution radio data .",
    "all points are plotted using the spectroscopic data from jackson et al .",
    "3c254 is the anomaly , having moved from core- to lobe - dominated due to the higher - resolution radio data.,width=302 ]",
    "the analysis in section 2 indicates that lack of high resolution radio maps affects the equivalent width/@xmath2 correlation .",
    "it is also likely that , despite a visual inspection process , some of the k11a `` lobe sources '' may be misclassified , again because of limited resolution and sensitivity of the radio data .",
    "in section 2 we pointed out that 3c254 has been misclassified as a high r lobe source simply because the resolution was insufficient to separate the second lobe from the adjacent core .",
    "another potential for mis - classification happens when one of the lobes of a triple source is either too weak or of too low a surface brightness to be detected in the first maps .",
    "finally , since the source density is high , some of the `` lobes '' of lobe sources may be chance associations . to assess how important these effects are we have performed some simulations .",
    "we first look at the effects of resolution and then try and quantify the effect of including a significant number of chance associations in the k11a sample .",
    "the original samples are small and contain mainly very radio - bright quasars .",
    "one possibility is that the fainter quasar population may be qualitatively different .",
    "the other possibility , considered here , is that the fainter quasars may behave in the same way as the brighter ones , but that the use of the first sample introduces a selection effect in the larger sample due to the exclusion of core - dominated quasars , primarily because of the limited angular resolution of first .",
    "we have therefore undertaken studies of a simulated radio population in order to assess the effect of selection .",
    "this has been done using the data and methods of wilman et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , who simulated a large population of radio sources to predict the sky as it would be seen by the square kilometre array ( ska ) .",
    "these s@xmath19 simulations are publicly available simulations , we have instead used the prescription given by wilman et al . , together with the s@xmath19 flux - redshift distribution to generate our own samples .",
    "we have checked that these agree with the properties of the s@xmath19 samples , and in particular that the sample of friis which is generated reproduces the source counts at low ( 1.4  ghz ) and high ( 18  ghz ) frequencies . ] .",
    "sources in this sample are chosen from a uniform distribution in intrinsic size between zero and @xmath20mpc , and the flux density and redshift distributions are obtained from measured radio luminosity functions at 151mhz ( wilman et al .",
    "2006 , and references therein ) .",
    "we assume the 151mhz flux of each source to be unbeamed , steep - spectrum emission , and project it to the required frequency of 1.4ghz using a spectral index of @xmath210.75 .",
    "this gives the extended flux density , which is the combined flux density of lobes and hotspot .",
    "the core flux density is calculated by multiplying this by @xmath2 , using a random angle to the line of sight , @xmath22 , to generate the @xmath2 value .",
    "positioning of core , lobe and hotspot components with respect to each other is carried out assuming that jet axes are randomly distributed in three dimensions .",
    "we modify the prescription slightly , in order to select only quasars , by choosing only those sources with an angle between radio jet axis and the line of sight in the range 0@xmath23 .    for each object , @xmath24 is given by    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the value of @xmath2 that would be seen in an object oriented in the sky plane , and @xmath6 is the ejection velocity as a fraction of the speed of light .",
    "the beaming factor associated with this value of @xmath2 is given by    @xmath27\\ ] ]    where    @xmath28^{\\frac{1}{2}}.\\ ] ]    for frii sources in the wilman et al .",
    "simulations , @xmath29 , and the distribution in @xmath26 is taken to be a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath30 ( but we also test other values ; see section 4 ) and a dispersion of 0.5 in log space .",
    "we make the conventional assumption that quasars are _ ipso facto _ frii sources , despite recent indications that phenomenological boundaries between fri and frii may be slightly blurred ( gendre et al . 2010 ; heywood , blundell & rawlings 2007 ) ; this is supported by the finding that our simulated quasars lie in the same region of @xmath31 space as sdss / first quasars ( fig .",
    "[ frtype ] ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      the equivalent width of emission lines can vary with orientation either because the the optical continuum emission has a non - thermal component that is relativistically beamed or because the thermal emission from a hot , flattened accretion disk will depend on viewing angle .",
    "such a disk orientation dependence can arise either from varying inclination angle of an optically thick , geometrically thin disk ( netzer 1985 , 1987 ) or orientation - dependent obscuration ( baker 1997 ) .",
    "the latter model is difficult to quantify but for disk orientation models , the dependence of line equivalent width on @xmath2 should be controlled by the variation of the optical continuum flux with the orientation angle to the line of sight , @xmath22 .",
    "the equivalent width should therefore be proportional to @xmath32 , assuming that no more subtle effects are operating ( such as intrinsically stronger line emission relative to continuum in more luminous objects ) .",
    "this dependence is shown for the simulated sample in fig .",
    "[ disk ] , together with the objects that survive the censoring of the first resolution . in this case",
    ", we have assumed that quasars only consist of objects with @xmath33 , the remainder of objects being identified with radio galaxies .",
    "this implies that although an anti - correlation should exist , the range of equivalent widths of [ oiii ]  expected is not very large ( c.f .",
    "the real data shown in fig .",
    "[ ewr2 ] ) , especially when the very core - dominated objects have been removed . in this case , the value of @xmath26 can again be changed in order to better fit the range of @xmath2 seen in the sdss / first censored sample , but this does not affect the basic argument .",
    "the pearson coefficient of the censored simulated sample from fig .  [ disk ] is @xmath210.56 .",
    "as previously suggested , however , the correlation expected from the triple sample would be expected to be weaker , due to the restricted range of @xmath22 present in this sample . as with the beaming models , the expected distribution of line equivalent widths _ vs. _",
    "@xmath2 is broadly consistent with the observed data .     against log @xmath2 for a simple disk model .",
    "the open circles represent all of the sample ; the filled circles are those which survive the censoring of the first 5-arcsecond resolution.,width=302 ]",
    "a dependence of line equivalent width on radio source properties is expected in beaming models and is potentially an important way to constrain the model parameters .",
    "the currently available radio data do not enable these parameters to be tightly constrained .",
    "in uncensored simulated samples a clear anti - correlation is expected , something which was observed in the original jackson & browne sample .",
    "kimball et al . have used much larger numbers of objects than used by jackson & browne in the expectation that these would better constrain beaming models .",
    "however from inspection of fig .",
    "[ ewr ] we can see that , if we instead restrict ourselves to data censored by the resolution of the first survey , that this trend is predicted to decrease or even disappear altogether . this is primarily because the high-@xmath2 objects which dominate the trend are only present in very limited numbers due to sample selection effects . the actual data , even with selection effects , do show the expected anti - correlation . by selecting our own sample of doubles from sdss and first and adding to the k11a samples of triples and lobe source we increase the range of @xmath2 sampled at the low @xmath2 end of the distribution .",
    "when we do this we can see a systematic trend of decreasing average equivalent widths with increasing @xmath2 as expected for beaming and disk orientation models .",
    "more generally , it is likely that simple dual - population / beaming models and databases ( jackson & wall 1999 ) , even when augmented by the inclusion of radio - quiet quasars ( jarvis & rawlings 2004 , wilman et al . 2006 ) may not fully represent the physical processes taking place in radio sources .",
    "one symptom of this is our failure to reproduce the @xmath2 distribution in the censored sdss / first quasar sample . understanding them will require simultaneous understanding of orientation and beaming effects , together with the processes of jet emission , interaction with the external medium and redshift evolution .",
    "this in turn requires the collection of mostly or completely identified samples of radio sources - not just quasars - with good radio information .",
    "a number of surveys are available at low flux density levels ( e.g. atesp , prandoni et al .",
    "2006 ; toot , vardoulaki et al . 2010 ; censors , best et al .",
    "2003 ) , but the combination of large numbers , complete optical information and high - quality radio maps is not yet available .",
    "new high - resolution radio instruments , including meerkat , jvla and e - merlin , and eventually the ska , will be very important in achieving this goal .",
