    "neutron - rich matter forms during a core - collapse supernova , as an increasing electron fermi energy drives electron capture .",
    "furthermore , while the outer crust of a neutron star consists of an ion lattice , the core ( or at least the outer core ) is believed to be uniform nuclear matter . between these two phases , a transition layer likely exists that involves non - spherical shapes @xcite .    near nuclear saturation density , the system is _ frustrated _ because of an inability to minimize all of the fundamental interactions .",
    "this competition between the attractive short - range nuclear force , with a range of order @xmath8 , and the repulsive long - range coulomb force produces complex nonuniform structures , called _ nuclear pasta _ @xcite .",
    "theoretical symmetry arguments and numerical simulations of the phases of nuclear pasta have identified a variety of structures .",
    "these phases are , in order of increasing density : spheroids ( `` gnocchi '' ) , rods ( `` spaghetti '' ) , slabs (  lasagna \" ) , uniform matter with cylindrical voids ( `` anti - spaghetti '' ) , and uniform matter with spherical voids ( `` anti - gnocchi '' ) @xcite .",
    "these geometries have been produced both by large - scale classical molecular dynamics simulations and quantum hartree - fock calculations @xcite .",
    "more exotic structures have also been recently identified , such as flat plates with a lattice of holes or `` nuclear waffles '' @xcite , a networked `` gyroid '' phase @xcite and chiral deformations in intertwined lasagna configurations @xcite .",
    "this indicates that pasta can be described by not only the simple shapes presented above , but that for varying proton fractions , temperatures , and densities there appear to be a richer variety of possible structures .",
    "increases in computing power now facilitate the study of a wider range of pasta shapes .    as nuclear pasta",
    "is expected to form during the core collapse phase of a supernova , it may play an important role in the evolution of the supernova and the resulting neutron star @xcite .",
    "for example , supernova neutrinos can scatter coherently from pasta , because neutrino wavelengths are comparable to the pasta size .",
    "therefore , calculations of the static structure factor of nuclear pasta can help determine the neutrino opacity in core collapse supernovae @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the pasta shapes could influence the thermal and electrical conductivities of the inner crust of neutron stars .",
    "_ suggest that topological defects in nuclear pasta increase electron pasta scattering and reduce the thermal conductivity . this could slow crust cooling after accretion in low mass x - ray binaries @xcite . furthermore defects",
    "would also reduce the electrical conductivity .",
    "this could lead to the decay of magnetic fields , if the fields are supported by currents in the crust . as a result",
    ", neutron stars would stop spinning down @xcite .",
    "the elastic properties of pasta , such as its shear modulus and breaking strain , help determine the maximum size of `` mountains '' that may be present on neutron stars . here",
    "pasta may be a particularly important part of the crust because of its high density .",
    "these mountains , on rapidly rotating stars , are energetic sources of gravitational wave radiation @xcite . finally the pasta breaking strain is relevant for crust breaking models of star quakes and magnetar giant flares @xcite .",
    "however , despite the large literature on nuclear pasta and its relevant astrophysical properties , very little work has been done identifying the role pasta might play in heavy element nucleosynthesis .",
    "astrophysical sites may involve the ejection of dense neutron rich matter that may originally be in a nuclear pasta phase .",
    "as the matter decompresses , the pasta shapes may react to form seed nuclei and free neutrons , and these may later undergo more conventional nucleosynthesis reactions .",
    "it is thought the rapid neutron capture process , or r - process , produces about half of the elements heavier than iron , but the site of the r - process remains uncertain @xcite .",
    "previously , supernovae were prime candidates but the most recent simulations of the neutrino driven wind in core collapse supernova are not neutron rich enough to produce heavy r - process elements @xcite .",
    "neutron star mergers have recently been identified as strong candidate sites for the r - process due to their ejection of neutron rich matter and their relatively high galactic merger rate , which is now expected to be as high as @xmath9 @xmath10 @xcite . recently , ns - ns mergers and ns - bh mergers have been studied using relativistic hydrodynamic simulations , which find that the nuclear abundances in ejecta match well to solar ratios and are robust for a variety of mass ratios for the merging system @xcite .",
    "calculations show that the inner crust provides the largest portion of ejecta mass and that the amount of ejecta varies with the mass ratio of binary .",
    "estimates range between @xmath11 for symmetric ns mergers and @xmath12 for asymmetric ns mergers , with systems where @xmath13 ejecting greater than @xmath14 @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the possibility that nuclear pasta , ejected from the inner crust during these mergers , could provide the initial material for the r - process .",
    "pasta properties could be important for the evolution of the material s temperature and entropy .",
    "furthermore , weak interactions in the pasta , such as neutrino or charged lepton capture , will determine the evolution of the proton fraction .",
    "in previous work we identified the average size of gnocchi ( mass number of nuclei ) using md simulations @xcite . in that work we evolved dense matter with a proton fraction of @xmath15 at a temperature of 1@xmath16 from high to low densities , @xmath17 to @xmath18 , by expanding the simulation volume at different rates . that work observed the nucleation mechanism for a number of different pasta phase transitions and quantified those transitions by calculating the average mean and gaussian curvatures , allowing us to characterize the phases by minkowski functionals .",
    "the simulated ns - ns mergers cited above observed ejecta expansion timescales on the order of milliseconds @xcite , which is much slower than the nuclear timescales in this work .",
    "as we expect nuclear matter to remain in nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) while evolving over such long timescales , we expand our simulation volume as slow as possible for as many time steps as computationally allowable , and compare to faster expansion rates to confirm that we are expanding slow enough to remain in quasi - static equilibrium , which should be expected of ejecta with millisecond expansion timescales .",
    "there have been many md simulations of heavy ion collisions to study the formation of clusters via multi - fragmentation , see for example @xcite .",
    "typically these involve relatively small systems and sometimes neglect coulomb interactions . in this paper",

    "both these machines consisted of general purpose multi - core cpu nodes .    in mid 2013 , indiana university acquired a cray xe6/xk6 supercomputer .",

    "iumd 6.3.1 is explained in greater detail in @xcite .",
    "here we explain it only enough to understand the performance we observed in our expansion runs .",
    "iumd is a parallel fortran code which uses mpi to pass data between nodes , openmp on each cpu to take advantage of its 16 cores , and cuda fortran to take advantage of the gpus . in discussing the code ,",
    "it is helpful to think of the two - particle interactions as making up a _ force matrix _ , whose @xmath46 element is the force @xmath47 that _ source _ @xmath48 exerts on _ target _ @xmath44 .",
    "overall of course , targets and sources are the same particles . in iumd the force matrix is partitioned into a @xmath49 block matrix , where @xmath50 is the total number of mpi processes ( nodes ) .",
    "each mpi process is responsible for calculating forces represented by one block .",
    "note that this decomposition is an abstract one , rather than one based on geometry .",
    "targets and sources are distributed randomly among mpi processes so that each process is responsible for the entire simulation volume , but only a fraction of the targets and sources in the volume .",
    "this is different from parallel algorithms where each process is responsible for all particles in a subvolume .",
    "the advantage of iumd is particles do not have to be transferred from process to process as they move from one subvolume to another . orchestrating such transfers",
    "involves a level of coding complexity that may be difficult to optimize .",
    "the disadvantage of iumd is that an mpi_allreduce must be performed to combine partial forces from different processes to get the total force on a target .",
    "however , this is a single call to an mpi subroutine that hopefully has been optimized in the mpi library .",
    "a similar mpi_allreduce is used to update source particle positions each time step .",
    "again , see @xcite for details .    the force calculation is by far the most time consuming part of each time step .",
    "it consists of a short - range two - nucleon nuclear force , and a screened coulomb force between protons .",
    "iumd calculates the nuclear force on the cpus using an efficient neighbor list algorithm .",
    "each target s neighbor list consists of those sources within distance @xmath51 .",
    "forces are calculated only for those sources within interaction range @xmath52 ; however , sources within a halo of thickness @xmath53 are included in the list so it does not have to be rebuilt every time step .",
    "rather , a target s list needs to be rebuilt only when the distance it has moved , plus the maximum distance any source on its node has moved exceeds @xmath53 . for only then is it possible that a source not in the target s list could have come into interaction range . since rebuilding neighbor lists",
    "is time - consuming and disruptive , all lists on all processes are rebuilt if any one list needs to be .",
    "we set @xmath54 for the runs in this paper . due to the rapid decrease of the nuclear force",
    ", it will rarely register for separations greater than this , even in 64-bit ieee arithmetic .    while the cpus calculate the nuclear force ,",
    "the gpus calculate the screened coulomb force using a simple all - pairs , or _",
    "particle - particle _ ( pp ) algorithm .",
    "the work for each process to calculate the screened coulomb force scales like @xmath55 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the number of targets and sources on each process .",
    "with work rising as the square of the number of particles , the pp algorithm would seem to be very inefficient . however , each kepler k20 gpu on bigred ii contains 2496 single precision floating point cores , 832 double precision cores , and 416 special function units for computing square root , exponential and trigonometric functions .",
    "this is a powerful computational capacity for implementing simple , straightforward algorithms , whereas complex algorithms may not work so well .",
    "thus we keep the algorithm as simple as possible , eschewing even the use of newton s third law , as it entails branching that would slow the gpu .",
    "we depend instead on the kepler k20 s massive parallelism . in the next section",
    "we show that for 51 200 nucleons , @xmath58 and densities of interest in nuclear pasta research , the pp algorithm running on gpus still finishes before the neighbor list algorithm on the cpus .",
    "even for 409 600 nucleons it outperforms the cpu at low proton fractions .",
    "the pp algorithm for the coulomb interaction takes order @xmath59 amount of work per process . for a fixed number of nucleons",
    ", it therefore scales as the square of the proton fraction . on the other hand ,",
    "the work involved in the neighbor list algorithm for the nuclear force is independent of @xmath60 , but depends linearly on density , because the the number of sources within interaction range of each target depends linearly on density .",
    "we therefore expect the work to calculate the nuclear force for all @xmath56 targets on a process to be of order @xmath61 . to this",
    "should be added the work to build neighbor lists .",
    "how frequently neighbor lists need to be rebuilt depends on the density and temperature of the system .",
    "we chose @xmath62 , to reduce the frequency , while still keeping lists relatively short . with this value of @xmath53",
    "we found that neighbor lists were rebuilt approximately every ten timesteps for high temperatures and densities , and every hundred time steps for low density , low temperature , equilibrium systems .",
    "the algorithm iumd uses to build neighbor lists involves dividing the simulation volume into cubical cells of width @xmath63 and checking only sources in a target s cell and its 26 neighboring cells .",
    "the work in this algorithm is thus of order @xmath64 , the same order as the nuclear force calculation itself .",
    "the exact coefficients in this estimate and the nuclear force calculation were not determined , but the work to decide if a source should go in a neighbor list is much less than calculating the force it exerts .",
    "thus the neighbor list build may be noticeable , but still a small fraction of the force calculation .    we collected timing data from the simulations described in sec .",
    "[ ssec : populations ] and sec .",
    "[ ssec:409600 ] to check the above workload estimates .",
    "these simulations involved 51 200 and 409 600 particles , run on 32 and 128 gpu nodes respectively .",
    "the simulations were evolved for @xmath65 with 2 fm / c per timestep on big red ii , and were expanded at a rate of @xmath66 , starting at an initial nucleon density of @xmath67 and decreasing to @xmath68 . since the density was monotonically decreasing the average time per md timestep could be calculated from timestamps on checkpoint files output by the program every @xmath69 timesteps during the @xmath70 timesteps of the run .",
    "figure [ fig : performance ] shows the average time per md timestep as a function of density for the five proton fractions we ran with 51 200 nucleons . for @xmath71 and 0.10",
    "time decreases almost linearly as density decreases , in accord with our model for the work involved in the nuclear calculation .",
    "this indicates the nuclear calculation takes longer than the coulomb at all densities .",
    "we call this the linear case . for",
    "@xmath72 time decreases linearly from @xmath73 to 0.01 @xmath74 , then flattens out . for this proton fraction",
    "the nuclear force calculation takes longer above 0.01 @xmath74 , while the coulomb calculation takes longer below 0.01 @xmath74 .",
    "we call this the broken linear case .    for @xmath75 and 0.30",
    "the decrease is linear for high density , but slower and nonlinear at lower density . according to our simple model , if the performance model is not linear or broken linear ,",
    "then the coulomb calculation should take longer at all densities , which we call the flat performance case .",
    "however , these two proton fractions fit none of these cases .",
    "what the model does not take into account , is that the size of neighbor lists actually depends on local density rather than mean density .",
    "as nucleons cluster into pasta shapes , or nuclei at very low mean density , the local density inside clusters goes to saturation density , while outside is a low density gas of neutrons , a few free protons and alpha particles . thus the curves for @xmath76 and @xmath77 are linear because there are few clusters . for @xmath72 clusters",
    "have not yet formed by the time mean and local density diverge . however , for @xmath75 and 0.30 clusters do form while the nuclear force calculation still dominates , so the curves gradually flatten .",
    "note that at about @xmath78 the curve appears to suddenly go horizontal .",
    "this may be the point at which the coulomb calculation finally dominates the time .",
    "the slopes of the curves do appear to depend on proton fraction and temperature . at @xmath79 mev , neighbor lists are rebuilt more often .",
    "since the work to do that depends linearly on density , they increase the coefficient in the order estimate , thus increasing the slope .    one odd characteristic of figure [ fig : performance ] is that the curves do not all start at the same point at @xmath80 .",
    "other tests we did to investigate this indicate it is due to differences in the way mpi communication is set up between different runs .",
    "either the node set allocated to the run , or the way the mpi runtime system places processes on nodes , may affect the efficiency of message passing .    in figure",
    "[ fig : performance409600 ] we show the time per md timestep for the @xmath81 nucleon run for @xmath76 on 128 nodes . because of the low proton fraction",
    ", the nuclear calculation dominates at all densities , resulting in the nearly linear decrease in time as density decreases .",
    "again there is a slight temperature dependence , being greater for @xmath79 mev .",
    "finally , we note the dependence on @xmath82 .",
    "this run involved eight times as many nucleions on four times as many nodes ( 128 vs. 32 ) . according to our model for the nuclear force",
    ", the run should have therefore taken twice as long .",
    "figure [ fig : performance409600 ] shows it performed better than this , taking on average only about 1.6 times as long",
