    "let @xmath5 be the farey sequence of order @xmath6 , which is defined to be the set of all subunitary irreducible fractions with denominators @xmath7 , arranged in ascending order .",

    "the cardinality of @xmath10 is well known to be @xmath11 when @xmath12 $ ] we write shortly @xmath13 instead of @xmath14}(q)$ ] .",
    "since @xmath15 contains a large number of fractions obtained by a combined process of division , sieving and sorting of integers from @xmath16 $ ] , one would apriori expect little or even no special structure in the set of all differences between consecutive fractions ( which we also call _ intervals of a second _ ) .",
    "though , this expectation is not fulfilled .",
    "this is sustained from many points of view by a series of authors , such as franel @xcite , kanemitsu , sita rama chandra rao and siva rama sarma @xcite , hall and tenenbaum @xcite , @xcite , hall @xcite , augustin , boca and the authors  @xcite , who have studied the set of gaps between consecutive farey fractions .",
    "a regularity is expected also in the set of larger gaps @xmath17 , where @xmath18 runs over @xmath19 and @xmath2 .",
    "( we use up - scripts , such as @xmath20 to write consecutive elements of @xmath15 . )",
    "it is our object to treat here the case @xmath4 , that is , the case of _ intervals of a third_.    geometrical representations of the set of pairs of neighbor intervals of fractions from @xmath15 created for different values of @xmath6 reveals sets of points whose density concentrates on different parts of the plane .",
    "the aesthetical qualities of the pictures catches attention immediately . for for any @xmath21 they look like a swallow and the main topological distinctions are in the number of folds of the tail .",
    "thus , when @xmath22 ( neighbor pairs of intervals of a second ) the swallow has a one - fold tail ( see @xcite ) . when @xmath4 , the case treated in the present paper , the swallow has a two - fold tail ( see figure  [ figure1 ] ) and in section  [ secsupport ] we have calculated explicitely the equations of the frontier . in the cases @xmath23 the tail appears always to have a three - folded tail , but this is more complex and its characterization will appear in a separate paper .",
    "given @xmath24 real numbers @xmath25 with mean spacing @xmath26 , we consider _ the @xmath27-th level of intervals of a third probability _",
    "@xmath28 on @xmath29 , defined , for @xmath30 , by @xmath31    in our case , we normalize @xmath10 to get the sequence @xmath32 , @xmath33 with mean spacing equal to one .",
    "accordingly , we get the sequence @xmath34 of the @xmath27-th level of intervals of a third probabilities on @xmath35 .",
    "we show that this sequence converges , as @xmath1 , to a probability measure @xmath28 , which is independent of @xmath36 , and can be expressed explicitly .    for any @xmath37 and @xmath38 in @xmath15 , we set @xmath39 this is the numerator of the difference @xmath40 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath41 for any consecutive elements of @xmath15 , and it turns out that this equality is responsible for the existence of the @xmath27-spacing distribution of the farey sequence .",
    "though , this relation is no longer true for larger intervals , but there is a convenient replacement . to see this , let us note that a farey fraction can be uniquely determined by its two predecessors . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath42 are consecutive fractions of @xmath15 , we have @xmath43 and @xmath44 , where @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "the basic idea of our procedure is to parametrize the set of @xmath27-tuples of intervals of a third in terms of just two variables that run over a completely described domain .",
    "the set of pairs of consecutive denominators of fractions in @xmath15 are exactly the elements of @xmath46 since we are mainly interested in what happens when @xmath47 , we reduce the scale @xmath6 times , and consider the background triangle @xmath48 , called _ the farey triangle_. we split it into a series of polygons as follows .",
    "firstly , for each @xmath49 , we set @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and then , for @xmath52 , we define recursively : @xmath53          l_{i-1}(x , y)-l_{i-2}(x , y)\\,.\\ ] ] then , as in @xcite , we consider the map @xmath54 where @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "the functions @xmath56 are locally constant , and the subsets of @xmath57 on which they are constant plays a special role .",
    "thus , for any @xmath58 , we get the convex polygon @xmath59 notice that @xmath60 and @xmath61 whenever @xmath62 .",
    "next we consider the application @xmath63 defined by @xmath64 our main result shows that , indeed , for @xmath1 , the sequence @xmath34 converges to a measure and @xmath65 is the needed tool to describe its support .",
    "[ theorem1 ] the sequence @xmath34 converges weakly to a probability measure @xmath28 , which is independent of @xmath36 .",
    "the support @xmath66 of @xmath28 is the closure of the range of @xmath67 , and @xmath68 for any parallelepiped @xmath69 .    in table  [ table1 ] from section  [ secsupport ]",
    "we provide explicit formulae for all the pieces that form @xmath70 .",
    "it is plain that in order to prove theorem  [ theorem1 ] , it suffices to see the effect of @xmath28 on bounded parallelepipeds . for any @xmath69",
    ", we define @xmath71 we have to show that the sequence @xmath72 is convergent when @xmath1 and the limit is independent of @xmath36 . in the beginning",
    "we treat the case of the complete interval @xmath12 $ ] .      in the following we write shortly @xmath73 instead of @xmath74}$ ] .    with the notations from the introduction",
    ", we see that @xmath75 . then @xmath76 can be written as @xmath77 knowing that @xmath78 , we consider the set @xmath79 since neighbor denominators in @xmath80 are always coprime , relation turns into @xmath81    next , we select the points with coprime coordinates using mbius summation ( cf .",
    "* lemma  2 ) ) , and we find that @xmath82 splitting @xmath57 into the series of polygons @xmath83 , we see that the error term in is @xmath84 . in the main term , we replace @xmath85 by the bounded set @xmath86 .",
    "these yield @xmath87 it remains to replace in the set @xmath88 by a set as in , but with bounds independent of @xmath6 in the corresponding inequalities .",
    "this set is @xmath89 notice that @xmath90 is exactly @xmath91 .",
    "the replacement does not change the error term because , via @xmath92 , we have : @xmath93 which implies @xmath94 therefore , by and , we get @xmath95    in particular , this gives @xmath96 , concluding the proof of the theorem when @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "suppose now that @xmath8 $ ] is fixed . in order to impose the condition that only the fractions from @xmath36 are involved in the calculations , we employ the fundamental property of neighbor fractions in @xmath80 .",
    "this says that if @xmath97 and @xmath98 are consecutive then @xmath99 .",
    "consequently , @xmath100 ( mod @xmath101 ) , and this allows us to write the fraction @xmath102 in terms of @xmath103 and @xmath101 .",
    "thus @xmath104    this time we have to estimate @xmath105 we may write as @xmath106 where @xmath107 for any @xmath108 $ ] and @xmath109\\colon\\          \\begin{array}{l }      \\frac{n_{\\mathcal{i}}(q)}{|{\\mathcal{i}}|q^2\\beta_i } <           \\frac{l_{i-1}\\big(\\frac { q'}q,\\frac { q''}q\\big )              l_{i+1}\\big(\\frac { q'}q,\\frac { q''}q\\big ) }               { k_{i}\\big(\\frac { q'}q,\\frac { q''}q\\big ) }      < \\frac{n_{\\mathcal{i}}(q)}{|{\\mathcal{i}}|q^2\\alpha_i},\\ i=1,\\dots , h         \\end{array }      \\right\\}.\\ ] ] for the best available technique to estimate the size of @xmath110 one requires bounds for kloosterman sums ( cf .  @xcite ) .",
    "this is done when @xmath111 and @xmath112 are intervals , but it may be easily extended for finite unions of subintervals of @xmath113 $ ] ( as the set @xmath114 is ) , even with the same same formula . for our needs here , it suffices a version with a slightly weaker term : @xmath115 inserting into , we get @xmath116 to calculate the sum in , we employ the euler - maclaurin formula , noticing the fact that @xmath117 , as a function of @xmath118 , is piecewise continuous differentiable on @xmath119 $ ] .",
    "we obtain @xmath120 the size of the error term is estimated observing , firstly , that @xmath121 . secondly , by the definition of @xmath114 it follows that there exists a partition of @xmath16 $ ] in finitely many intervals with the property that the cardinality of @xmath114 is monotonic on each of them .",
    "therefore @xmath122 then , forgathering , , in and using again the estimate @xmath123 , we obtain @xmath124 this concludes the proof of the theorem .",
    "for @xmath125 , we have @xmath126 . for @xmath127 , by theorem  [ theorem1 ] , it follows that @xmath66 is a countable union of hyper - surfaces in @xmath128 .    the support @xmath66 has some striking features .",
    "let us see them in the case @xmath129 .",
    "we write @xmath130 and observe that @xmath131 roughly speaking , by definition we find that @xmath132 corresponds to the set of 3-tuples @xmath133 of consecutive elements of @xmath15 with the property that @xmath134 .",
    "similarly , @xmath135 corresponds to the set of 4-tuples @xmath136 of consecutive elements of @xmath15 with the property that @xmath134 and @xmath137 .",
    "we remark that @xmath138 , and also @xmath139 whenever both @xmath140 and @xmath141 are @xmath142 , except when @xmath143 .",
    "notice that the symmetry of the farey sequence of order @xmath6 with respect to @xmath144 produces a sort of balance between the polygons @xmath135 and @xmath145 .",
    "then the support @xmath66 is the closure of the image of the function @xmath146 , which can be written as @xmath147 in which @xmath148 , @xmath149 , for @xmath150 .",
    "a tedious , but elementary , computation allows us to find precisely the boundaries of @xmath151 .",
    "the image obtained is shown in figure  [ figure1 ] and the equations are listed in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "all the functions that produce the equations of the boundaries of @xmath151 are either of the form @xmath152 , with @xmath153 in a certain interval that might be unbounded , or the symmetric with respect to @xmath154 of such a curve . here",
    "@xmath155 are integers .",
    "we conclude by making a few remarks .",
    "firstly , we mention that @xmath146 has a symmetrization effect , namely , it makes @xmath156 and to @xmath157 to be symmetric with respect to the first diagonal @xmath158 , for any @xmath159 .",
    "the diamond are close to being , but are not exactly straight lines .",
    "the same applies for the edges of the diamonds in the tail .",
    "] @xmath160 is the single nonempty domain @xmath151 that has @xmath158 as axis of symmetry .",
    "the top of the beak of the swallow @xmath66 has coordinates @xmath161 .",
    "the asymptotes of the wings are @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "the highest density is on a region situated in the neck , where many components of the swallow overlap partially or completely .",
    "table  [ table1 ] below lists all the equations of the boundaries of @xmath151 . in the head of the table @xmath164 represents an edge of @xmath135 ( listed in counterclockwise order , starting either from the east or from the north side ) and @xmath165 is a parametrization of @xmath166 .",
