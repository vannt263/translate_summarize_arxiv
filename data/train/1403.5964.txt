    "one - dimensional systems are used frequently in quantum mechanics to approximate real situations because they are relatively easy to treat mathematically , allowing to get a deeper insight on the physics involved .",
    "they are useful in a number of applications in contemporary physics and their simplicity has made them valuable as academic and research tools .",
    "for instance , it turns up in the description of resonant tunneling diode devices , disordered one - dimensional lattices , realistic one - dimensional solid - state system such as quantum wells , junctions and superlattices @xcite , and time analysis of one - dimensional tunneling processes @xcite . in particular , one - dimensional rectangular potentials can be used to model isolated transitions , observed in semiconductors , from a bound state within a quantum well to a bound state at an energy greater than the barrier height @xcite . limiting cases of rectangular potentials can be used to describe point interactions @xcite , as well as regularized singular interactions @xcite .",
    "also , we should point out that the use of square - barrier and square - well potentials as simple models for more realistic physical problems has a long history in the theory of heterostructures in solid - state physics @xcite .    however , the propagator or its fourier transform , the green s function , for rectangular potentials , although these are very simple systems , are difficult to obtain and involve lengthy and tedious calculations .",
    "indeed , the exact green s function and propagators for step potential and square barrier was obtained only in the late 1980s until the early 1990s @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is well known that semiclassical approach , i.e. , the van vleck - gutzwiller formula @xcite , or the wkb approach @xcite , give poor results when applied to the class of rectangular potentials due to their discontinuities .    in the present work ,",
    "we show how to obtain the exact green s function @xcite , given as a general sum over paths , in a very simple way avoiding complicated calculations , for arbitrary rectangular potentials enlarging the knowledge of exact solutions for green s functions and also generalizing and resuming results in the literature .",
    "the procedure outlined here can be thought of as exact version of the approximation in @xcite and provides simple and direct way to construct recurrence relations for quantum amplitudes for one - dimensional scattering discussed in @xcite .",
    "specifically , we focus on green s function for single quantum wells to avoid extra and unnecessary mathematical complications , but the method is general and could be applied to multiple quantum wells as well @xcite . from the green s functions",
    "obtained , we thus describe how to extract the bound states eigenenergies and eigenfunctions . also , we discuss an application of the green s function approach to extract information of quasi - bound states in rectangular potentials .",
    "we should observe that the green s function approach used in the present work , has been successfully used in the calculation of exact green s functions for segmented potentials @xcite , in calculation of asymptotic green s functions @xcite , in the determination and discussion of bound states in multiple quantum wells @xcite . also , in the calculation of exact green s function for quantum graphs @xcite , general point interactions @xcite , and scattering quantum walks @xcite .",

    "suppose we have a complete set of normalized energy eigenstates @xmath8 , @xmath9 with @xmath10 so that the solution of eq . can be written as @xmath11 for a discrete spectrum , we thus identify the poles of green s function with bound states eigenenergies and the residues at these points give a tensorial product of the bound states eigenfunctions .",
    "the continuous part of the spectrum corresponds to a branch cut of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the following limit @xmath12 is used to extract the discrete bound states from the green s function .",
    "there are basically three methods for calculating the green s functions @xcite : solving the differential equation in ; summing up the spectral representation in ; or performing the feynman path integral expansion for the green s function @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we present a feynman - like procedure . as we are going to see",
    ", the approach requires one to determine the quantum amplitudes of each individual potential , but in general , this is a much easier task than to calculate numerically propagation along the whole @xmath13 .",
    "according to refs .",
    "@xcite the green s function @xmath3 ( in what follow , we will denote it by @xmath14 for short ) for a general 1d potential is obtained by writing the potential @xmath13 as a sum of @xmath15 individual potentials @xmath16 , where each @xmath16 vanish asymptotically . in the present work , we focus our attention on rectangular potentials . as depicted in fig .",

    "in this section we will consider the case of a quantum particle confined in the asymmetric well potential defined by @xmath35 and depicted in fig . [ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "we seek the green s function for the situation where @xmath36 .",
    "the eigenvalues will be obtained from the poles of the green s function and the eigenfunctions from their respective residues ( cf .",
    "[ sec : gfdp ] ) .",
    "we can write nine different green s functions for the problem , but for our purposes , we analyze only three relevant possibilities , namely : ( 1 ) @xmath37 and @xmath38 ; ( 2 ) @xmath39 ; and ( 3 ) @xmath37 and @xmath40 . the others six green s functions can be obtained from symmetry considerations of the three above cases .",
    "first , we want to exemplify how to use the eq . and",
    "how the geometric series appear .",
    "so , let us consider the possibility ( 2 ) . to obtain @xmath41 in a closed form , we need to sum up all the possibles scattering paths for a quantum particle starting from @xmath4 and arriving at @xmath42 , but it can always be done because the sum in forms a geometric series . without loss of generality ,",
    "let us set @xmath43 .",
    "thus , in fig . [",
    "fig : fig3 ] is depicted five examples of scattering paths .",
    "the first path in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](a ) is the direct propagation from @xmath44 to @xmath42 , which contributes with @xmath45 for @xmath41 . in fig .",

    "following the same reasoning , the contributions for the other examples in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] are : @xmath51     and @xmath52 . ]",
    "the green s function is then given by the sum of all contributions of @xmath15 multiple reflections of all possibles scattering paths and can be written as ( @xmath53 ) @xmath54\\big\\}. \\label{eq : gexefinal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in general , the reflections ( transmissions ) amplitudes have the property @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) , in such way as the above sum always converge .",
    "in fact , it is a geometric series .",
    "so , after a straightforward algebra the final form for the green s function is @xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "the method utilized above consists in sum up all scattering paths , but this could be very tedious and cumbersome",
    ". however , this can be done by a simple diagrammatic classification in families of paths , which is a practical way to identify and perform the geometric series mentioned above .",
    "consider again the confined particle in the asymmetric well potential .",
    "the particle starting from @xmath4 may ( a ) go to the right arriving @xmath5 ; or ( b ) go to the left , hit the potential @xmath59 at @xmath60 being reflected .",
    "there is an infinite family of paths for the particle at @xmath60 , we call this family @xmath61 ; and ( c ) the particle go to the right , hit the potential @xmath49 at @xmath46 being reflected .",
    "like before , there is infinite family of paths for the particle at @xmath46 , we call this family @xmath52 . these two infinite family of paths",
    "are schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](f ) .",
    "thus , by using the above prescription , the green s function can be written as @xmath62 the family @xmath61 ( @xmath52 ) posses two contributions : ( a ) go to the right ( left ) , arriving at @xmath42 ; and ( b ) go to the right ( left ) , hit the potential @xmath49 ( @xmath59 ) at @xmath46 ( @xmath60 ) being reflected followed by the family @xmath52 ( @xmath61 ) .",
