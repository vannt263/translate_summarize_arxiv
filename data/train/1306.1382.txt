    "population studies of x - ray sources are vital for our understanding of the dynamical and chemical evolution of the host galaxies since the luminous x - ray sources reflect the current activities or endpoints of the high - mass stars .",
    "many long - exposure observations were dedicated to elucidating the x - ray population in our galaxy such as asca galactic plane survey @xcite , xmm - newton galactic plane survey , and champlane @xcite .",
    "these extensive observing campaigns had the advantage of detecting extremely faint x - ray sources , which has never been achieved for the extragalactic x - ray surveys .",
    "nevertheless , the sky coverage for the galaxy is limited due to the deep pointing observations .",
    "hence , the more effective approach is probably required to decipher the discrete x - ray population of the galactic components  galactic center , disk , and bulge . because of the most recent survey which had completed a full sky coverage with an imaging x - ray optics , the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ) provides the useful database to study the x - ray population with the flux limit down to @xmath15  erg  s@xmath12  @xmath10 .",
    "the rass detected many unidentified x - ray sources towards the galactic bulge where the interstellar medium in the line of sight does not hamper the soft x - rays in the rosat pspc band ( @xmath16@xmath17  kev ) .",
    "this fact motivates us to carry out the follow - up observations to investigate their nature ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the present paper ,",
    "we report the x - ray properties of the cluster of galaxies newly detected with such an x - ray observation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows ; we first present the observations with suzaku and chandra in section [ section : observation ] .",
    "the x - ray data analysis is explained in section [ section : analysis ] .",
    "after the discussion ( section [ section : discussion ] ) , we give a short summary of the source identification in section [ section : summary ] . throughout the paper",

    "the xis consists of four charge - coupled devices ( ccds ) ; three of which are front - illuminated ( fi ) ccds ( xis0 , 2 , 3 ) , and the other is a back - illuminated ( bi ) one ( xis1 ) .",

    "it is well known that there is diffuse x - ray emission with characteristic fe - k emission lines towards the galactic plane ( galactic ridge x - ray emission ( grxe ) : @xcite ) .",
    "since the x - ray intensity of this diffuse emission has a spatial dependence ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , ) , we aligned the axes of the ellipse to the galactic longitude and latitude to mitigate the spatial variability of the grxe .",
    "the size of the ellipse was determined so as to avoid the detector corners illuminated by the calibration sources , anomalous rectangular region in xis0 , and the eastern point source .",
    "we made the background - subtracted xis light curve for each ccd sensor , and then fitted the light curves with a constant model .",

    "this indicates that there is no significant x - ray emission above @xmath4  kev within the hxd - pin fov .",
    "hence , we ignored the hxd - pin data in the spectral analysis .    to examine the spatial extent of the source quantitatively , we generated a radial profile of the surface brightness from the xis image without the nxb subtraction and the vignetting correction , shown in figure  [ fig : radial_profile ] .",

    "since the xrt psf and the vignetting effect are convolved in the radial profile , we evaluated @xmath5 and @xmath66 as described below .",
    "first , we created a sky image which surface brightness is given by a @xmath5-model of @xmath68 . the peak brightness was set to be at @xmath63 . assuming that the x - ray emitting gas is an isothermal optically - thin plasma with the temperature of @xmath69  kev and that the x - ray emission is modified with a foreground absorption of @xmath30  @xmath10 , we simulated the xis events using ` xissim ` . the exposure time and photon flux",

    "then , the peak brightness was normalized to be unity .",
    "the x - ray emission from suzaku j1759@xmath03450 is contaminated by some celestial and instrumental background components : grxe , cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) , and nxb .",
    "the contribution of the nxb , @xmath71 , was estimated by generating the surface brightness profile from the nxb image . in order to estimate the cxb and grxe contributions , denoted by @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively , we again simulated the xis events assuming a uniform sky with a radius of @xmath74 .",
    "the procedure for deriving @xmath72 or @xmath73 was the same as that of @xmath70 .",

    "after the nxb subtraction , we fitted the spectrum with a phenomenological model : an optically - thin thermal plasma model with two different temperatures , referred to as @xcite , plus the cxb model described above .",

    "the best - fit parameters of @xmath111 , @xmath114 , the abundance , and the redshift @xmath120 were all consistent with those derived from the @xmath159 case . the bolometric luminosity changed by @xmath36% : @xmath160  erg  s@xmath12 in the lower - limit case and @xmath161  erg  s@xmath12 in the upper - limit case .    according to the equation ( 5 ) in @xcite , the expected bolometric luminosity at @xmath8  kev is @xmath162  erg  s@xmath12 , 3 times larger than that of suzaku j1759@xmath03450 . taking into consideration a relatively large scatter in the @xmath13@xmath14 relation shown in figure 5a of @xcite , however , we should conclude that the combination of the temperature and bolometric luminosity within @xmath163 of suzaku j1759@xmath03450 is consistent with that of a typical cluster .",

    "our conjecture that suzaku j1759@xmath03450 is not a relaxed system supports their claim .",
    "we note that the overdensity radius of @xmath164  mpc also agrees with a hot gas associated with a cluster of galaxy , since the overdensity radius depends weakly on the redshift parameter and concentrates around @xmath165  mpc ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we discovered extended hard x - ray emission above @xmath36  kev towards the unidentified x - ray source , 1rxs j175911.0@xmath0344921 , with the suzaku and chandra observations .",
    "thanks to the low background level , characteristic of the suzaku s performance , the spectrum of this diffuse x - ray emission was obtained with sufficient photon statistics .",
    "we summarize the image and spectral analyses of this diffuse emission , designated as suzaku j1759@xmath03450 , as below .    1 .",
    "the radial profile of the surface brightness of suzaku j1759@xmath03450 was explained with the isothermal @xmath5-model .",
    "the core radius and power - law index were estimated to be @xmath166 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the suzaku j1759@xmath03450 spectrum was well reproduced with the x - ray emission from an optically - thin thermal plasma with the temperature of @xmath106  kev , modified with the galactic absorption of @xmath167  @xmath10 .",
    "the emission line at @xmath90  kev was identified with the redshifted ( @xmath130 ) k@xmath110 emission from the helium - like fe ions .",
    "the elemental abundance was @xmath118 relative to the solar value .",
    "3 .   assuming that the x - ray emitting gas is an isothermal sphere in hydrostatic equilibrium , the total mass of this cluster of galaxies was estimated to be @xmath144 .",
    "the unabsorbed bolometric luminosity within @xmath163 of @xmath168  erg  s@xmath12 was slightly lower than that expected from the electron temperature of @xmath8  kev and the @xmath169@xmath14 relation .",
    "however , the relatively large scatter in the @xmath13@xmath14 relation allows suzaku j1759@xmath03450 to be considered as a new member of cluster of galaxies .",
