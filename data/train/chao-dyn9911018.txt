    "chaotic properties of few degrees of freedom systems have attracted much attention during the last years .",
    "the knowledge and classification of chaotic dynamical systems is now extremely accurate , if compared with the status of art at the beginning of the century . on the other hand ,",
    "conventional statistical mechanics was born long before the chaology of dynamical systems .",
    "it is well known that , in contrast to chaotic dynamical systems with few degrees of freedom , for the onset of statistical equilibrium in systems with an infinitely large number of particles neither the non - linearity nor the interaction between particles is needed . indeed , in such systems the thermodynamic limit ( infinite number of particles , @xmath0 ) leads to the statistical behavior of a system since any weak interaction ( with an environment or between particles ) gives rise to mixing properties and onset of chaos .",
    "although statistical mechanics has obtained undoubtedly results in many different fields , fundamental questions about statistical description of systems with finite number of particles are still open@xcite .",
    "it is clear that in such systems the interparticle interaction is crucial , however , its role in producing chaos or ergodicity is still not understood . due to computing difficulties and lack of theoretical studies ,",
    "many  body chaotic systems have been scarcely investigated and little is known about them .",
    "recently , a novel approach to quantum isolated systems of finite number of interacting particles has been developed @xcite .",
    "the goal of this approach is a direct relation between the average shape of exact eigenstates ( @xmath1function ) , and the distribution of occupation numbers @xmath2 of single - particle levels .",
    "this relation shows that there is no need to know exactly the eigenstates , instead , if these eigenstates are chaotic ( random superposition of a very large number of components of basis states ) , the @xmath1 function absorbs the statistical effects of interaction between particles and determines the form of the @xmath3distribution .",
    "the approach has been mainly developed for a model with completely random two - body interaction between a finite number of fermi - particles , however , it can be also applied to dynamical models with chaotic behavior .",
    "one of few dynamical models studied with the use of this approach is a system of two interacting spins @xcite .",
    "the most interesting result obtained numerically in ref.@xcite , is that the distribution of occupation numbers ( even for two interacting particles ) in the chaotic region can be described in the form of the standard bose - einstein ( be ) distribution ( only symmetric states have been considered which results in the be statistics ) . it was shown that the statistical effects of the interaction lead to an increase of temperature which is related to the be distribution .",
    "also , it was discovered that the canonical distribution is recovered if one randomize the _ non - zero elements _ of the interaction @xmath4 keeping the dynamical constrains of the model .",
    "this means that random interaction plays the role of a heat bath and allows to use statistical and thermodynamical description for isolated systems .    in order to extend the approach of refs.@xcite to classical dynamical systems with a large number of particles",
    ", we introduce below the model of @xmath5 interacting spins in one - dimension . due to the well - defined classical limit",
    ", it is of the first interest to explore similar problems in the classical counterpart .",
    "the problem of a quantum - classical correspondence for chaotic systems with a large number of interacting particles seems to us extremely important in view of many physical applications . in this paper",
    "we mainly concentrate on the occurrence of boltzmann s law and on the classical counterparts of quantum local density of states and shape of eigenfunctions .",
    "we deserve for future work @xcite the investigation of the analogous fermi - dirac or bose ",
    "einstein statistics in a quantized version of such a model .",
    "our investigation is complementary to the approach based on the so - called _ dynamical _ temperature @xcite , introduced for the study of the statistical properties of few degrees of freedom classical models with chaotic behavior .",
    "specifically , our interest is in the notion of _ statistical _ temperature associated with boltzmann s distribution ( if any ) for single particle energy .",
    "the relation between statistical and dynamical temperatures represents an open and interesting question .",
    "our purpose is to investigate a few  body dynamical system from the statistical mechanics point of view . following previous works on two  particle spin problem@xcite",
    ", we consider the hamiltonian : @xmath6 which is known as the 1-d heisenberg model in a magnetic field , see for instance @xcite . here",
    "@xmath7 are spin vectors , and , for sake of definiteness we take periodic boundary conditions , @xmath8 .",
    "the classical version is a solvable model , from the statistical point of view ( namely when the number of particles @xmath9 , see @xcite ) .    instead , we are here interested in a dynamical approach , in particular , for a small number of particles , when the usual statistical approach is at least questionable . in",
    "what follows , we shall consider a more simple version of the classical heisenberg model , which is described by the following hamiltonian  : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the number of spins in the chain .",
    "this we do , in order to simplify analytical calculations .",
    "the equations of motion can be written in the usual way :     @xmath12    where @xmath13 are the poisson brackets ( see @xcite for similar dynamical models ) .",
    "constants of motion are the energy @xmath14 and the magnitude of the angular momenta @xmath15 ( the latter assumed to be the same for each spin ) . without loss of generality",
    ", we can put @xmath16 .",
    "contrary to the common view point ( spin hamiltonian plus a magnetic field as a perturbation ) we consider the `` magnetic '' part as an unperturbed hamiltonian . indeed , we are interested in models which can be generally expressed as a sum of single particle hamiltonians , this feature not being shared by the perturbation @xmath4 . therefore , the heisenberg kernel ( @xmath17 ) will be considered as a perturbation between nearest - neighbor spins .",
    "the unperturbed hamiltonian is integrable and the solution of the unperturbed equations of motion can be written down at glance .",
    "it should be pointed out that the perturbation itself is not chaotic .",
    "indeed , it can be verified numerically that two close trajectories diverge only linearly in time when @xmath18 .",
    "this means that the maximal lyapunov exponent is zero for any choice of the initial conditions . on the other side",
    "the same lyapunov analysis shows that the total hamiltonian , for generic values of the coupling @xmath19 and for energy values in the middle of the band @xmath20 is chaotic .",
    "maximal lyapunov exponents , as a function of time for different @xmath19 and @xmath21 values and fixed energy @xmath14 , are shown in fig.[lyap1 ] .",
    "as one can see , the lyapunov exponents approach zero when @xmath21 decreases , or @xmath19 increases . on the other side , for fixed @xmath19 and @xmath21 different from zero ,",
    "the region where the maximal lyapunov exponent approaches zero is close to the edge of the energy spectrum ( see fig.[lyap2 ] ) .",
    "maximal lyapunov exponents have been calculated using the standard recipe @xcite .",
    "besides integrability , the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath22 , in the limit @xmath23 , has good statistical properties which we are going to exploit in the next section .",
    "it is , indeed , interesting to compare our results with those obtained with the standard statistical approach .",
    "this particular choice of the model , being extremely simple , allows an analytical treatment of the case @xmath9 in both unperturbed and perturbed case .",
    "let us analyze first the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath22 .",
    "this should be thought as a model for a very weakly interacting system . in what follows , without loss of generality",
    ", we assume @xmath24 . the microcanonical ensemble represents the most natural way to analyze an isolated system of @xmath5 spins .",
    "one question is to find the thermodynamical temperature in dependence on the energy @xmath25 .",
    "another is to study the single particle energy distribution and the conditions under which it can be assimilated to the boltzmann distribution .",
    "the temperature @xmath26 ( @xmath27 hereafter ) can be defined via the microcanonical ensemble :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the entropy . for a sufficiently large number of particles",
    "this can be in turn defined as @xmath30 . here",
    "@xmath31 can be defined through the phase space volume @xcite .",
    "if the motion of @xmath5 spins is ergodic , each of them covers uniformly the unit 3d sphere .",
    "therefore , each component of @xmath32has a uniform probability density function in the interval @xmath33$]@xcite , that is  :    @xmath34    and the same for the other components @xmath35 and @xmath36 . here",
    "the quantity @xmath37 gives the probability that the continuous random variable @xmath38 gets values less than @xmath39 .",
    "in the same way , the density of states can be evaluated as a probability  :    @xmath40    the distribution of the sum of @xmath5 independent random variables can be obtained using the central limit theorem ( when @xmath41 ) ,    @xmath42    where @xmath43 as a result , from eq.([ent ] ) one gets an unusual _ microcanonical relation _ for the energy vs. inverse temperature @xcite :    @xmath44    in principal , the energy @xmath45 ranges from @xmath46 to @xmath47 , therefore , in this model negative temperatures are possible too .",
    "one should note that typical physical systems have density of states increasing with energy , thus giving positive temperature .",
    "for this reason , in what follows , we consider only positive temperatures which correspond to the left ( part of the symmetric ) energy spectrum , @xmath48 .",
    "it is important to notice that the density of states can also be obtained for finite system of particles without invoking central limit theorems .",
    "it can be done by a direct integration over the phase space volume ,      where @xmath50 is the integer part of @xmath51 .",
    "let us now concentrate on the  single - particle energy distribution \" ( _ spe - distribution _ ) defined as  :    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the conditional probability .",
    "this quantity is the classical analog of the quantum _ distribution of occupation numbers _ , which gives the number of particles occupying a single - particle level with energy @xmath54 .",
    "correspondingly , the above classical distribution determines the probability that _ any _ of @xmath5 spins has the energy @xmath54 . from this definition , it is clear that the spe - distribution ( [ n0def ] ) is normalized to the total number of particles , and it defines the mean energy of _ all _ particles , or , the same , the mean total energy of the system . in this way",
    ", one can treat an isolated model in the same way as the model in contact with a heat bath ( see details in refs.@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "it is well known that for @xmath9 the single particle energy should be distributed according to boltzmann s law . under suitable conditions this holds true in this model , too .",
    "indeed , one gets    @xmath55    where the last equality is due to the independence of @xmath56 .",
    "the quantity @xmath57 defines the joint probability density function .    substituting the expression ( [ rho0 ] ) into the above relation",
    ", it is easy to obtain ( in the limit of a very large @xmath58 )  :    @xmath59    where @xmath48 .",
    "obviously , a correspondent expression for any number of particles can be obtained , using the exact value of the unperturbed density of states eq.([exaro ] ) . in fig.[n10e0 ] we show the infinite ( gaussian ) approximation @xmath60 and the exact one , computed for two different energy values . as one can see",
    "while in the middle of the spectrum the distributions are almost the same , close to the band edges they are remarkably different .",
    "the gaussian , or infinite approximation , works very well even for a small number of particles as soon as the energy @xmath54 is not close to the edges of the band ( the interval @xmath61 $ ] for non - interacting spins ) .",
    "indeed , the gaussian density of states has infinitely long tails , while the exact one is sharply defined within @xmath61 $ ] . on the other hand",
    "while the support of the density function scales as @xmath5 , its variance depends on @xmath62 .",
    "it follows that the region close to the edges becomes less and less important as @xmath5 becomes large .",
    "let us briefly comment eq.([b1 ] ) .",
    "although it has been obtained for a large number of particles , nevertheless it shows that , generally speaking , the single particle energy distribution for finite weak  interacting systems _ is not necessarily described by an exponential law_. one can see that the latter occurs in a very strong limit @xmath9 , provided that @xmath63    where the temperature @xmath64 is defined via @xmath65 and @xmath48 .",
    "one should stress that , apart from the limit @xmath66 , the exponential distribution arises when the second condition @xmath67 ) . specifically , taking the derivatives of both sides of eq.([bd ] ) over @xmath68 , and exchanging the derivative in the r.h.s .",
    ", one gets  :    @xmath69    one can see that in the limit @xmath9 and @xmath70 , the r.h.s coincides with the microcanonical definition of temperature while the l.h.s .",
    "shows that the only possible exponential distribution should have the microcanonical temperature .",
    "we have thus found that in the non - interacting system , when the number of particles becomes sufficiently large and the total energy of the system is larger than the typical single particle energy , the _ microcanonical temperature _ ( [ mmc ] ) defined by the density of states , coincides with the _ statistical temperature _ defined directly from the spe - distribution ( [ n0def ] ) which is the standard boltzmann law .",
    "one can then assume that if the interaction is sufficiently small , in order not to change dramatically the previous results , but enough to produce ergodicity ( from the equations of motion ) , boltzmann s law again results from taking a sufficiently large but finite number of particles .",
    "let us stress that in order to get these results , the motion has been assumed to be fully ergodic on the unit 3d sphere .",
    "rigorously speaking , this can be true , from the dynamical point of view , only in the presence of interaction @xmath71 .",
    "indeed for @xmath72 the motion is foliated onto regular tori and no ergodicity at all is allowed .",
    "so , this ideal spin model has been worked out following the traditional statistical mechanics picture , where the interaction is assumed to be sufficiently weak in order to apply non  interacting results , but sufficiently strong in order to get ergodicity .",
    "before switching to the interacting case , let us compute the density of states in the presence of an infinitely strong interaction ( namely putting formally @xmath18 ) . in this case",
    "the density of states can be written as  follows ,    @xmath73    the central limit theorem can also be applied in this case , keeping in mind that the normalized probability distribution of the product @xmath74 of two uniformly distributed random variables @xmath75 in the interval @xmath76 is given by @xcite , @xmath77 so that the variance is @xmath78 .",
    "eq.([rhoi ] ) then becomes ( in the large @xmath5-limit )  :    @xmath79    with @xmath80 note , that even in this case an explicit integral equation can be obtained for finite systems . following the same steps as in eq.([exaro ] ) , one gets  : @xmath81 ^n\\ ] ] where @xmath82 is the sine - integral function defined by @xmath83      in the same way the density of states in the presence of both the interaction and the `` kinetic '' term can be computed assuming @xmath22 and @xmath4 are independent . indeed ,",
    "let us define  :    @xmath84    on the other hand , if @xmath22 and @xmath4 are independent , their joint probability density function can be written as @xmath85 the probability density function of the sum of two independent random variables is thus given by@xcite  :    @xmath86    substituting eqs.([rho0],[rhoi ] ) , and performing simple gaussian integrals one gets  :    @xmath87    where the variance @xmath88 should be compared with eq.([sigmav ] ) .    in eq.([rho2 ] ) there are two different approximations .",
    "the first one is the gaussian form for the density of states , which is valid when @xmath9 .",
    "the second is the independence of the ( random ) terms @xmath22 and @xmath4 which , of course , can not be true in general .",
    "for instance , a configuration with all spins aligned along the @xmath89-axis , for which @xmath90 implies @xmath91 .",
    "however , if the motion is ergodic and the energy is not too close to the band edges , the second assumption can be considered as a good approximation .",
    "another important relation can be obtained linking the two quantities , _ shape of  eigenfunctions _  ( se ) and _ local density of states _ ( ldos ) , whose concepts were motivates by quantum mechanics ( see for example , @xcite ) . the latter quantity , ldos , also known in nuclear physics as _ strength function _",
    ", is very important when describing the spread of the energy initially concentrated in a specific unperturbed state .",
    "the classical analogs of these functions have been introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and recently applied to dynamical models in refs.@xcite .",
    "the very point is that in the limit of @xmath9 these two quantities can be explicitly found and a relation between them can be established .    in the case of ergodic",
    "motion the classical analog of the shape of eigenstates ( se ) can be defined as    @xmath92    correspondingly , the classical analog of the ldos is    @xmath93    it is very important that both the se and ldos can be computed more efficiently @xcite using the equations of motion . for",
    "the se one has to choose a chaotic trajectory at some fixed energy @xmath14 , compute the @xmath94 trajectory and sample the values of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath22 along this trajectory at some fixed time intervals .",
    "this procedure gives us the ergodic distribution inside the _ energy shell _ constructed by a projection of the phase space of @xmath95 onto @xmath22 ( see details in @xcite ) . in the same way",
    ", the classical ldos can be numerically computed taking a bunch of ( regular ) trajectories of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath96 and computing the correspondent spread of @xmath97 along these unperturbed trajectories .",
    "the sample of the values of the total hamiltonian @xmath97 taken at given intervals of time results in the classical ldos .",
    "let us stress that even in the case of ergodic motion of the total hamiltonian @xmath95 , when only one single trajectory is needed in order to get the se , an ensemble of trajectories of @xmath22 is necessary in order to get a reliable result for the ldos .",
    "this is a consequence of the integrability of @xmath22 .",
    "alternatively one can choose , as indicated by the definitions ( [ ef]),([ldos ] ) , many different initial conditions on the same energy surface and sum over them .",
    "it is clear that the two procedures ( dynamical and taking the average over the phase volume ) should give the same result in the case of ergodic motion .",
    "an important identity can be easily proven from the relations ( [ ef]),([ldos ] ) .",
    "let us write , @xmath98 from which one can get the classical se ,    @xmath99    in the same way one can obtain the classical ldos , @xmath100    from above , the following relation emerges ,    @xmath101    let us stress that the previous identity does not depends on the gaussian approximation and it takes into account dynamical correlations too .",
    "this simple relation between classical se and ldos is very important in different applications .",
    "remarkably , only unperturbed and perturbed densities of states , @xmath102 and @xmath103 , get into this relation .",
    "this allows to relate the shape of eigenstates to that of the ldos in the corresponding quantum model , in a deep semiclassical region .",
    "in fact , the knowledge of these two functions leads to a novel semiclassical approach according to which it is easy to detect quantum effects of localization , see details in @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that classical se and ldos , in essence , are ergodic measures for energy shells defined by the projection of @xmath22 onto @xmath95 ( and vice versa ) in the energy representation .",
    "functions @xmath104 and @xmath105 can be considered as kernel operators transforming unperturbed quantities in total ones and vice versa .",
    "for instance , by integrating eq.([id ] ) one has  : @xmath106 and the converse ,    @xmath107    in a certain way @xmath108 and @xmath109 can be considered one the inverse of the other .",
    "it is also easy to check that when @xmath110 then @xmath111 .    assuming the gaussian approximation for the densities of states , and using eq.([id ] ) we can easily get an analytical expression for the classical se  :    @xmath112 \\label{ef1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath113 is the variance , and @xmath114 is the center of the se .    in order to obtain the ldos distribution",
    ", one can use the relation ( [ i d ] ) from which one gets , @xmath115\\ ] ] where @xmath116 it is interesting to note that the above distribution , in the gaussian approximation , coincides with eq.([rhoi2 ] ) ,    @xmath117    this relation can be also obtained independently , using the assumption of the independence of @xmath22 from @xmath4 .",
    "one can see that although the two gaussians are different , for a weak interaction @xmath118 , and then @xmath119 , they appear to be close one to each other .",
    "this fact is of a general nature and occurs in other models , see refs.@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , this result shows that , strictly speaking , even in the case of ergodic motion , one should not expect se and ldos to be the same .",
    "as was found above , the relation between the se and ldos is given by eq.([id ] ) .",
    "one can obtain a very useful relation for the variances of the se and ldos ( valid in the gaussian approximation only ) , @xmath120    we would like to stress again that both se and ldos have a proper meaning only in the case of ergodic motion .",
    "in other cases they strongly depend on initial conditions and on the energy , thus not allowing to use any statistical approach .      for @xmath121",
    ", the microcanonical temperature @xmath122 can be defined from the total density of states ( [ rho2 ] ) ,    @xmath123    with @xmath124 .",
    "in fact , eq.([mci ] ) determines the _ thermodynamical temperature _ since it establishes the relation between the temperature and total energy of a system .",
    "now , we are going to find the _ statistical temperature _ associated with the spe - distribution .",
    "first of all , let us notice that , if the variables @xmath22 and @xmath4 are independent the following approximate relation can be obtained  :    @xmath125    substituting eqs.([b1],[ef1 ] ) , in eq.([pir ] ) one gets ,    @xmath126    where @xmath114 . note that when @xmath72 , then @xmath127 and eq .",
    "( [ b1 ] ) is recovered .",
    "one can see that in the limit @xmath128 and @xmath129 the spe - distribution can be approximated by the exponential dependence :   @xmath130 where @xmath131    the last equality , claiming that the statistical temperature coincides with the thermodynamical one , is by no means trivial .",
    "from one side , the presence of strong interaction suggests some statistical equilibrium property thus leading to the microcanonical predictions . on the other side we do not know if the single particle description is valid since the interaction is strong . even in the case when mean field approach would be possible ( in such a way",
    "that part of the interaction becomes actually a single particle energy ) , the single - particle distribution would depend on the mean field and there are no reasons to expect , a priori , that the boltzmann distribution occurs with the same temperature as given by the microcanonical ensemble .    another way to find the statistical temperature which corresponds to the spe - distribution , is as follows .",
    "first , we note that in the presence of interaction one has    @xmath132    that is different from the non - interacting case , for the latter the obvious relation holds ,    @xmath133    note that the spe - distribution in eq.([ec ] ) depends on the interaction , however , the  mean value \" of the energy of all particles does not correspond to the energy of a system .",
    "this very fact allows to relate statistical effects of the interaction to an increase of the total energy ( in application to quantum systems this approach was considered in @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , in order to find the spe - distribution @xmath134 from eq.([ec ] ) , one needs to know the _ renormalized energy _ @xmath135 .",
    "one can see that the boltzmann distribution gives a correct result for an isolated system , if we take into account the shift of the energy @xmath136 which is due to the interaction between particles . in a sense ,",
    "the ( statistical ) effects of the interaction are absorbed by the increase of the energy of a system , compared to the case of non - interacting particles .",
    "therefore , pseudorandom interaction may be treated as an internal heat bath , thus giving rise to a statistical equilibrium .",
    "the shift @xmath137 can be found by assuming the absence of correlations between @xmath22 and @xmath4 in a way described above .",
    "one can show that    @xmath138    where @xmath114 is the center of the classical se , and the last equality occurs in a strong limit @xmath139 using eq.([ef1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the shift is given by the following relation , @xmath140    it is important that the shift is defined by the width @xmath141 of the ldos and by the width of the unperturbed density .",
    "one should note that in quantum representation , the variance @xmath142 is defined by the sum of squared off - diagonal matrix elements .",
    "therefore , this energy shift can be found without diagonalization of huge quantum hamiltonian matrices . using this shift",
    ", one can find the temperature from eq.([ec ] ) by assuming the boltzmann dependence for @xmath143 .",
    "one more way to obtain the temperature is via the unperturbed density of states evaluated at the renormalized energy @xmath135",
    "@xmath144    using the relation between @xmath135 and @xmath14 , one gets , @xmath145    once again , we should remind that apart from the limit @xmath139 , the above relation is valid when neglecting the correlations between @xmath22 and @xmath4 . however , the smaller is the number of particles , the larger is the energy region where ( dynamical ) correlations will be important .",
    "it is now interesting to find the increase of temperature @xmath146 due to the interaction , in comparison with the temperature @xmath64 of the system with non - interacting spins , @xmath147 one can see that the relative increase of temperature is given in terms of the variance of the ldos and the width of the unperturbed density only ( see also eq.([shift ] ) .",
    "this fact seems to be generic , see discussion in @xcite .",
    "more accurate relation for the definition of temperature via the spe - distribution , without the assumption of the gaussian form of the density of states , can be obtained as follows . in close analogy to eq.([bin ] ) one can write , @xmath148 on the other hand , defining @xmath149 , and @xmath150 it follows  : @xmath151    owing the independence of the 3 random variables , the joint probability density can be factorized and one gets  : @xmath152 defining now the `` interacting '' density of states    @xmath153    one gets a relation similar to eq.([bin ] )  : @xmath154    eq.([z5 ] ) states that if correlations can be neglected then a renormalized density of states must be introduced in order to get the ",
    "correct \" temperature as obtained from the single particle energy distribution . on the other hand",

    "it is now interesting to apply our estimates to a system with not very large number of spins .",
    "let us first consider the model with @xmath158 spins .",
    "on one hand , this situation is far from the thermodynamic limit , on the other hand , the number of particles is quite large and one can expect a good correspondence with analytical results obtained in previous section . in fig.[n100e ] two spe - distributions are plotted for different values of the total energy @xmath14 . in both cases ,",
    "the trajectories have been found to be chaotic with positive maximal lyapunov exponents . for comparison , the analytical expression ( see eq.[bint ] ) , obtained in the gaussian approximation ,",
    "as one can see , the agreement is fairly good .    on the other hand ,",
    "a direct comparison of the microcanonical temperature @xmath159 with the approximated temperature , obtained by fitting the spe - distribution by an exponent , gives different answers , see fig.[n100b ] .    in this figure",
    "crosses represent the fitted inverse temperatures as a function of the total energy , while the dashed curve is the microcanonical relation between the inverse temperature and the energy . in order to smooth fluctuations",
    ", the derivative has been calculated performing local averages in small energy windows . a small , but systematic ,",
    "difference between the statistical and microcanonical temperatures is clearly seen .",
    "a much better agreement can be achieved by using directly , ( instead of the total density of states ) the renormalized density eq.([z4 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding result is presented by the full line .",
    "one can see quite good correspondence to numerical data for the statistical temperature .",
    "this result means that eq.([z4 ] ) is more accurate than the usual statistical definition ( [ mci ] ) .",
    "one can also introduce the effective ( statistical ) temperature by making use of eq.([bint ] ) , keeping all terms in the exponent .",
    "the temperature can be defined as a slope of @xmath160 at the bottom of the energy spectrum , @xmath161 with @xmath162 .",
    "the corresponding result is shown in fig.[n100b ] by the dotted line .",
    "one can see that this dependence practically coincides both with the fit to actual distribution @xmath134 ( crosses ) , and with the temperature determined by eq.([z4 ] ) ( full line ) .",
    "this means that these two approximations correctly take into account both the dynamical correlations and the finite number of particles .",
    "we can conclude that , in spite of the relatively small number of particles , if compared with the usual thermodynamical systems of @xmath163 particles , our model of @xmath158 interacting spins can be approximately described by standard statistical approach which ignores dynamical correlations between particles .",
    "indeed , the difference between microcanonical temperature and the approximate temperature found by the fit of the spe - distribution close to the edge of the energy spectrum , is quite small and may neglected in some cases .",
    "however , even for a relatively large number of spins , @xmath164 , a clear influence of dynamical correlations and finite number of particles remains .",
    "one should , however , stress that in spite of a clear manifestation of the influence of dynamical correlations and finite number of particles , the spe - distribution @xmath134 for low energies can be effectively described by the standard boltzmann distribution , however , with a renormalized temperature .",
    "it is reasonable to think that a statistically stable distribution would require a certain degree of chaoticity .",
    "but chaos itself , as indicated , for instance , by the positivity of the maximal lyapunov exponent , is not enough in order to get equipartition among different degrees of freedom ( see general discussion of this very important problem in @xcite ) .",
    "we have found such cases for a small number of particles and energy close to the center of the spectrum .",
    "it is instructive to work out a specific example .",
    "let us consider a system of @xmath165 spins .",
    "for @xmath166 and energy @xmath167 the single particle energy distribution is very different from the phase average distribution ( obtained with many different initial conditions in a small energy window close to @xmath168 ) , see fig.[n4 ] .",
    "nevertheless , the lyapunov exponent is positive for many initial conditions inside the same energy window .",
    "this lack of ergodicity is also reflected in the lack of equipartition . indeed , defining the average unperturbed single particle energy ,",
    "as @xmath169 we get that , typically , for trajectories with energy @xmath14 close to @xmath168 , neighbors spins do not share the same energy ( lack of equipartition ) . in table",
    "i , we show the average kinetic energy per spin for a dynamical trajectory with the energy @xmath168 ( second column ) , to be compared with the average kinetic energy per spin as obtained from the phase average distribution ( right column ) within the energy range @xmath170 $ ] .",
    ".average kinetic energy per spin . [ cols= \" < , > , < \" , ]     [ tabl ]      in this section we deal with systems having a small number of spins ( let us say , order of ten ) .",
    "in contrast to the case considered in the previous section , we select only those energy values which correspond to both a positive lyapunov exponent and to equipartition among different spins ; this means , in particular , that `` dynamical '' and `` statistical '' distributions ( the former obtained by integration of equations of motion for one trajectory , the latter by choosing many different initial conditions onto the energy surface and performing a phase average ) are close one to each other .",
    "let us focus on two different samples of @xmath171 and @xmath172 interacting spins with strong and chaotic interaction ( @xmath173 ) . in figs.[n105],[n106",
    "] we show the spe - distribution for different energies , together with the correspondent gaussian approximations eq.([bint ] ) .",
    "the first important point is a remarkable deviation from the gaussian approximation , at least for energy values @xmath14 close to the band edge .",
    "this simply means that the approximations involved in order to get eq.([bint ] ) are no longer valid .",
    "one of these approximations was to consider a gaussian shape for the se in eq .",
    "( [ pir ] ) . according to additional data , the effective se ( statistical or dynamical , they are very close one to each other ) for the same energy value show remarkable deviations from the gaussian .",
    "nonetheless , the substitution of the `` true '' se in eq.([pir ] ) does not affect considerably @xmath134 . this amount to say that eq.([pir ] )",
    "itself does not constitute a good approximation for energy values close to the edges .",
    "indeed , due to a small number of spins , and to the relatively large energy shared by each spin particle , they are strongly correlated and most of the uncorrelation assumptions ( between @xmath22 and @xmath4 , for example ) made in the previous chapters are no longer valid .    to be more precise , it can be shown that eq.([pir ] ) can be considered as the `` diagonal '' approximation of the following exact relation    @xmath174    where @xmath175 in the limit when @xmath95 and @xmath22 are independent one recovers eq.([pir ] ) since @xmath176 .",
    "the study of the correlation kernel eq.([coke ] ) beyond the diagonal approximation will be deserved for future investigations .",
    "on the other side , in the middle of the energy band @xmath177 there is a rough agreement with the gaussian approximation ( see fig.[n105 ] ) . indeed , for such energy values",
    ", there is no preferred direction of the spin ( the energy shared by each single spin is relatively small ) and eq.([pir ] ) still represents a good approximation .",
    "however , the bad point is that close to the center of the band the gaussian approximation for @xmath134 is far from an exponential ( in fact , it is close to a gaussian ! , see eq.[bint ] ) .",
    "indeed , let us remember that one of the conditions in order to obtain the boltzman distribution was @xmath178 , which is of course not satisfied at the center of the energy spectrum .",
    "even if not completely satisfactory from the theoretical point of view , but in close analogy with the case of @xmath158 spins , one could define a temperature as ( minus ) the slope of the fitting straight line to @xmath179 .",
    "operatively we observe that in the region to the left of their intersection point ( @xmath180 for @xmath171 and @xmath181 for @xmath172 ) , distributions with different energy value have a behavior closer to an exponential .",
    "therefore , it is natural to fit the numerical @xmath134 with an exponential only to the left of the intersection point",
    ". let us call @xmath182 the inverse temperature obtained in this way .",
    "needless to say , when compared with both the statistical and microcanonical temperature , one can see important deviations . in figs.[n105f],[n105 g ] we plot the obtained @xmath182 as a function of the energy @xmath14 , together with other definitions of temperature for @xmath171 and @xmath172 .    as one can see",
    ", none of the previous definitions seems to fit the numerical values .",
    "this is not surprising , in spite of the fact that only an approximate exponential behavior has been found .",
    "we do not have any approximate theory able to describe such temperature differences when the number of spins is small .",
    "strictly speaking , one recognizes the importance of the classical se in the description of the behavior of single particle distribution , but it becomes technically complicated to go beyond the diagonal approximation , which is correct only when the number of particles is sufficiently large and the energy is not too close to the `` many  body ground state '' ( bottom of the energy spectrum ) .",
    "the following approximate phenomenological scaling relation has been numerically found :    @xmath183    where @xmath184 is the fitting parameter and @xmath185 . in fig.[fscal ] for different @xmath5 , @xmath19 and energy @xmath14 we show the numerical data and the scaling relation eq.([scal ] ) .",
    "we have not , for the time being , a theoretical explanation of this scaling relation . it should be stressed that , in the limit @xmath186 and sufficiently large energy @xmath187 the second term in the l.h.s . of eq.([scal ] ) is negligible with respect to the first one and eq.([rene1 ] ) is recovered .",
    "we remind that it is not possible to take @xmath188 in this model since it becomes integrable , and most of the previous results are necessarily wrong .",
    "the disagreement between the microcanonical temperatures and the statistical one for a small number of particles has few important theoretical implications .",
    "first of all we note that they are obtained in two completely different ways .",
    "while the single particle distribution reflects a property of the constant energy surface @xmath189 , the microcanonical definition requires a derivative _ across _ the energy surface . in principle , the knowledge of the correlation kernel eq.([coke ] ) would solve completely the problem .",
    "but this in turn requires the knowledge of the ( infinite ) intersections among the @xmath189 surface and the @xmath96 ones .",
    "in this paper we have studied the emergence of boltzmann s law for the single particle energy distribution @xmath134 in a isolated dynamical model of finite number of interacting spins . in the limit of a very large number of spins",
    "this model allows an analytical treatment .",
    "we have shown that in this strong limit , boltzmann s distribution , indeed , occurs with an effective _ statistical _ temperature which coincides with that defined by the standard _",
    "microcanonical temperature_. the latter is defined via the total density of states . since our analytical proof is also valid for a strong spin interaction , it is far from trivial .",
    "indeed , it is not a priori clear that the spe distribution , which pertains a non  interacting property , follows the boltzmann distribution with the temperature determined via the total density of states .",
    "the above result has been obtained in an approach which is very similar to that recently suggested in the study of the so - called _ two - body random interaction model_@xcite . according to this approach , the distribution of occupation numbers for single - particles levels in a quantum many - body system ,",
    "is directly related to the average shape of chaotic eigenstates in the basis of the unperturbed hamiltonian ( the latter can be considered as the mean - field part of a system ) .",
    "this means that , in fact , there is no needs to know exact eigenstates of huge hamiltonian matrices which takes into account two - body interaction between particles .",
    "this is due to the chaotic nature of eigenstates , which results from the ( assumed ) randomness of the two - body matrix elements .",
    "an important point of the above approach is that in some cases the average shape of eigenstates can be found analytically from off - diagonal matrix elements of the total hamiltonian @xmath22 , see ref.@xcite .",
    "the same happens to another important quantity , the _ strength function _ , which in solid state physics is also known as the _ local density of states _ ( ldos ) .",
    "these two quantities are related to each other , however , so far this relation is not well - studied .",
    "numerical data for different models , disordered @xcite and dynamical @xcite as well , have shown that for not very strong interaction , these two quantities are very close one to each other .",
    "the knowledge of ldos is very important in many applications .",
    "indeed it gives the information on how energy , initially concentrated in a specific unperturbed state , spreads over all other states due to the interaction between particles .",
    "the inverse width of ldos is , in fact , the effective time of this spread .    until recently ,",
    "the above two quantities have been discussed only in the context of quantum systems . on the other hand , in @xcite",
    "it was noted that both ldos and se have a very clear classical analog .",
    "the study of the _ classical _ ldos and se have been started in @xcite , and the first results have shown that the average shape of quantum eigenstates ( and the same for the ldos ) for chaotic eigenstates coincides fairly well with the classical counterpart .",
    "for this reason , when studying the occurrence of boltzmann s distribution in our model of interacting spins , we have also paid attention to the classical ldos and se .",
    "our results in what concerns classical se and ldos have shown a nice correspondence to the main findings for the quantum model with random two - body interaction @xcite . in particular , in our classical model we have proved the basic expressions for an increase of both total energy ( [ shift ] ) and temperature ( [ deltat ] ) due to statistical effects , which in quantum model have been derived directly from the shape of exact eigenstates in the unperturbed energy basis . moreover , new relations ( [ i d ] ) and ( [ relation ] ) have been found which may be important also in quantum systems .",
    "numerical data for our model have confirmed main theoretical predictions for a large number of particles , @xmath158 .",
    "however , it was also found that in spite of a relatively large @xmath5 , one can detect clear deviations for the statistical temperature related to the spe - distribution .",
    "detailed analysis shows that these deviations are mainly due to dynamical effects of correlations originating from a finite number of particles .",
    "as was shown , analytical results can be interpreted as a `` diagonal '' approximation , that is neglecting correlations between the total and the unperturbed hamiltonian .",
    "one should stress that the correction to the thermodynamical expressions are not only on the order of @xmath190 as commonly assumed in the literature , but depend on the interaction strength as well .",
    "drastic deviations from the thermodynamical approach have been found for few interacting spins ( @xmath172 and @xmath171 ) .",
    "namely , both the thermodynamical temperature defined from the microcanonical relations , and the statistical temperature found analytically for a very large @xmath5 , are very different from the approximate temperature .",
    "the latter has been determined numerically from the boltzmann dependence of the spe distribution , used as a fitting expression for low energies of the system .",
    "a phenomenological expression has been found from the analysis of the data , however , without a proper analytical explanation .",
    "these problems , as well as the developments of a _ semiquantal",
    "_ approach for which quantum distribution of occupation numbers is computed with the use of classical analog of the shape of eigenstates , will be a subject of future investigations .",
