    "our understanding of the local universe and the local galaxy population originates primarily from the all - sky photographic schmidt surveys and the established catalogues of bright galaxies derived from them , such as the catalogue of galaxies and clusters of galaxies @xcite , the morphological catalogue of galaxies @xcite , the uppsala general catalogue of galaxies @xcite , the eso / uppsala catalogue @xcite , the southern galaxy catalogue @xcite , the catalogue of principal galaxies @xcite , the edinburgh / durham southern galaxy catalogue @xcite , the apm catalogue @xcite , the third reference catalogue of bright galaxies @xcite and the supercosmos sky survey @xcite .",
    "while these catalogues have provided invaluable information and insight , uncertainty remains as to their completeness , particularly for low surface brightness and compact galaxies @xcite .",
    "in addition there are concerns as to the photometric accuracy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the susceptibility to scale errors @xcite , plate - to - plate variations @xcite and dynamic range .",
    "these photographic - based catalogues have been the starting point for numerous spectroscopic surveys aimed at measuring the local space density of galaxies ( i.e.  the local galaxy luminosity function ) .",
    "the space density of galaxies is our fundamental census of the local contents of space and therefore a crucial constraint for models of galaxy formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the imaging catalogues are in omission and/or photometrically inaccurate then regardless of the completeness of the spectroscopic surveys our insight into the galaxy population will be incomplete and most likely biased against specific galaxy types .    over the past two decades",
    "there have been numerous estimates of the local galaxy luminosity function ( e.g.  eep , @xcite ; mt stromlo / apm , @xcite ; autofib , @xcite ; esp , @xcite ; ssrs2 , @xcite ; durham / ukst , @xcite ; sdss - cd , @xcite ; 2dfgrs , @xcite ) and of the three - parameter schechter function used to represent it @xcite . typically the surveys agree broadly on the faint end slope ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) but show a marked variation in the characteristic luminosity ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 per cent ) and normalization ( @xmath6 , @xmath22 per cent ) .",
    "the uncertainties in the schechter parameters result in an uncertainty of @xmath23 per cent in the local luminosity density , @xmath24 .",
    "this uncertainty is usually expressed as the normalization problem which has been somewhat overshadowed by the more notorious faint blue galaxy problem @xcite .",
    "the latter describes the inability of basic galaxy number count models to predict the numbers of galaxies seen at faint magnitudes ( @xmath25  mag ) in the deep pencil beam ccd - based surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the lesser known normalization problem describes the inability of number count models to explain the galaxy counts even at bright magnitudes ( @xmath26  mag ) by as much as a factor of @xmath27 ( see discussions in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in many ways the normalization problem is the more fundamental : while luminosity evolution , cosmology and/or dwarf galaxies can be , and have been , invoked in varying mixtures to explain the faint blue galaxy problem ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , none of these can be used to resolve the normalization problem .    in the past",
    "the problem was typically circumvented by renormalizing the number count models to the range @xmath28  mag ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the justification was that the bright galaxy catalogues , on which the luminosity function measurements are based , are shallow and therefore susceptible to local clustering .",
    "however the crucial normalization range typically occurs at the faint limit of the photographic surveys ( where the photometry and completeness are more likely to be a problem ) and at the bright end of the pencil beam ccd surveys ( where statistics are poor ) . while convenient , the clustering explanation overlooks two more worrisome possibilities : gross photometric errors and/or gross incompleteness in the local catalogues .",
    "if either of these two latter explanations play a part this will have important consequences for the new - generation spectroscopic surveys , namely the 2dfgrs @xcite and the sdss @xcite .",
    "the input catalogue of the 2dfgrs is an extensively revised version of the photographic apm survey ( which is known to show a peculiar steepening in its galaxy counts at bright magnitudes , @xcite ) , with zero - point and scale - error corrections from a variety of sources including the 2mass @xmath29-band survey and the data presented in this paper ( see @xcite for details ) . in the case of the sdss  which leaps forward in terms of dynamic range , uniformity and wavelength coverage  the effective exposure time is relatively short ( @xmath30  s ) and the isophotal detection limit is comparable to that of the photographic surveys .",
    "hence while issues of photometric accuracy should be resolved the question mark of completeness may remain .    to address the above problems within a single , well - defined dataset we require a survey that is reasonably deep and yet has a large enough solid angle to provide accurate and statistically significant galaxy counts over the crucial normalization range .",
    "furthermore , the survey s photometry must be accurate and its completeness high , i.e.  it must probe to low surface brightnesses .",
    "[ surveys ] shows a number of imaging surveys in terms of their sky coverage and magnitude range . dashed and solid lines indicate photographic and ccd - based surveys , respectively . typically the faint surveys are ccd - based while the local surveys are photographic ( with the notable and recent exception of the sdss - edr , @xcite ) .",
    "while the ccd surveys make significant improvements in surface brightness and magnitude limits their sky coverage is small .",
    "it is only very recently that large ccd mosaics such as the wide field camera ( wfc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the sdss instrument @xcite have been constructed that now allow a large area of sky to be surveyed within a realistic time frame .    in this paper",
    "we present the millennium galaxy catalogue ( mgc , sections [ data][sellimits ] ) .",
    "the mgc represents a new medium - deep , wide - angle galaxy resource , which firmly connects the local and distant universe within a single dataset ( cf .",
    "fig  [ surveys ] ) . in section",
    "[ counts ] we produce the galaxy number counts spanning the range @xmath5  mag .",
    "we then focus on the normalization problem by comparing our counts over the range @xmath31  mag to the predictions of a number of local luminosity function estimates in section [ lumfs ] .",
    "our counts provide stringent constraints on the normalization of the luminosity function and hence on the local luminosity density .",
    "our conclusions are given in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "the 2dfgrs and sdss will essentially supersede all previous redshift surveys and therefore it is important to verify their photometric accuracy and completeness on as large a scale as possible .",
    "we will provide a detailed comparison of the 2dfgrs and sdss - edr imaging catalogues with the mgc in a companion paper @xcite .",
    "a more long - term aim of the mgc project is to provide structural information on the galaxy population around the crucial normalization point ( @xmath32  mag ) .",
    "it is ironic that since the advent of the hubble space telescope we have a greater understanding of the morphological mix of galaxies at faint magnitudes than at bright magnitudes .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite published morphological galaxy counts spanning the range @xmath33  mag , yet no reliable morphological galaxy counts at brighter magnitudes exist .",
    "consequently , no accurate local morphological luminosity functions exist ( compare , for example , the conflicting results of @xcite and @xcite ) and the evolution of the different morphological types can not be accurately constrained .",
    "the mgc will enable us to remedy this situation as it allows morphological classification and the extraction of structural parameters to @xmath34  mag .",
    "the data and catalogues presented in this paper are publically available at http://www.roe.ac.uk/@xmath35jol / mgc/.",
    "all data frames where taken using the wide field camera ( wfc ) .",
    "the wfc is mounted at prime focus on the @xmath36 m isaac newton telescope ( int ) situated at la palma .",
    "the wfc is a mosaic of four 4k@xmath372k thinned eev ccds with a smaller 2k@xmath372k loral ccd which is used for auto - guiding .",
    "each of the science ccds measures @xmath38 pixels with a pixel scale of @xmath39  arcsec / pixel  this gives a total sky coverage of @xmath40  deg@xmath1 per pointing .",

    "[ outline ] .",
    "full details of the wfc are provided at http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/@xmath35wfcsur/technical.html ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the data constituting the mgc comprise @xmath41 overlapping fields forming a @xmath42  arcmin wide equatorial strip from @xmath43 to @xmath44 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the observations were taken during @xmath45 observing runs , 1999 march 1516 , 1999 april 1617 , 1999 june 613 and 2000 march 26april 4 . each field",

    "hence each field is offset from the previous by @xmath51  arcmin along the equatorial great circle .",
    "[ outline ] shows the survey outline for the first three pointings .",
    "note the substantial overlap between neighbouring fields .",
    "the survey region was chosen because it is contained within both the 2dfgrs @xcite and the sdss - edr @xcite regions , thus providing redshifts and colours for the brighter galaxies and allowing a detailed check of the photometry and completeness of these surveys .",
    "all observations were taken during dark or grey time through variable conditions .",
    "the seeing ranged from @xmath52 to @xmath53  arcsec with the median seeing at @xmath54  arcsec .",
    "the air masses ranged from @xmath55 to @xmath56 .",
    "[ obsstat ] shows a summary of the general observing conditions across the survey .",
    "as much of the data were collected during clear but non - photometric nights it was necessary to dedicate a single pristine photometric night ( 2000 march 30 ) to obtaining suitable calibration data at various stages along the survey strip . in total @xmath57 mgc fields were observed during the photometric night . of these ,",
    "six were only @xmath58  s exposures as they had already been observed previously .",
    "these observations were interspersed with @xmath59  s observations of standard stars spanning a wide range in airmass .",
    "the standard stars where taken from the @xcite standard areas sa98 , sa101 , sa104 and sa107 .",
    "some science frames were later found to be of too poor a quality to be useful and these were re - observed : the first eight fields were replaced with two @xmath60  s exposures each and field @xmath61 is a single @xmath62  s exposure .",
    "all the preliminary data reduction  flat - fielding , bias correction and astrometric calibration  was done by the cambridge astronomy survey unit ( casu ) and full details of this process are provided by @xcite . briefly , a number of bias frames are collected each night and the median is subtracted from the data . all data",
    "( including flat - fields ) are corrected for a known non - linearity .",
    "a twilight flat - field is taken during evening and morning twilight ( when possible ) and a median flat - field derived for that particular run is divided into each data frame . after this process",
    "an initial astrometric calibration is made to the hst guide star catalogue .",

    "[ mgc036 ] shows the final reduced image for one of our pointings , field 36 .",
    "it illustrates problems with satellite trails , ccd defects , gaps between ccds , etc .    to assess the final astrometric accuracy we compared the positions of doubly detected objects in regions where neighbouring fields overlap ( cf .",
    "[ outline ] ) .",
    "the overlap regions are of size @xmath63  deg@xmath1 and each contains @xmath64 objects in the range @xmath65  mag , , @xmath66 refers to the kron magnitude , uncorrected for galactic extinction ( cf .",

    "[ radecoff ] shows the median positional differences for these objects for each overlap region as well as the overall @xmath67ra and @xmath67dec distributions .",
    "we find that both of these distributions have an rms of @xmath68  arcsec .",
    "note , however , that they are slightly but significantly offset from zero which is most likely due to residual radial distortions .",
    "as mentioned previously , four @xcite standard star fields were observed at a range of air masses throughout the course of the photometric night . for each observation of each standard star",
    "we computed a zero - point @xmath69 where @xmath2 was taken from @xcite and @xmath70 is the flux of the star as measured from the data .",
    "we then fitted these zero - points with a double linear function in airmass ( @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the zenith distance ) , and colour , @xmath73 where @xmath74 is again taken from @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ stdzp ] we show the data and the fit .",
    "the residuals have an rms of @xmath75  mag and show no obvious trend with airmass , colour , @xmath2 or time of observation .",
    "note , however , that a systematic error of @xmath76  mag was needed to achieve an acceptable fit . from the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ stdzp ] we can see that for several stars multiple observations of the same star give consistently high or low results .",
    "this may indicate that these stars are slightly variable or that the errors on the @xcite photometry have been underestimated .    for each mgc field",
    "we then computed a theoretical zero - point @xmath77 , which is expected to be correct only for those fields observed during the photometric night .",
    "we extracted objects as described in section [ objex ] and identified duplicate detections in regions where any two images overlapped .",
    "using only objects with @xmath78  mag and stellaricity @xmath79 ( cf .",
    "section [ class ] ) we computed , for each overlap region , the median of the magnitude differences of the double detections , @xmath80 , as well as an error on the median , @xmath81 . in fig .",
    "[ dm_fn](a ) we show @xmath82 for all the overlap regions using the initial , theoretical zero - points .    a linear least - squares routine was then used to adjust the zero - points of the non - photometric fields in order to minimize the quantity @xmath83 where the sum goes over all overlap regions .",
    "the process of object extraction , matching and zero - point adjustment was then repeated until a stable solution was reached ( four iterations ) .",
    "since the zero - points of the photometric fields are held fixed at their theoretical values , the above procedure assumes that the observing conditions were perfectly stable throughout the photometric night .",
    "one can derive an estimate of the real - life error on the photometric zero - points , @xmath84 , by comparing the scatter of @xmath82 with @xmath81 for those overlap regions that only involve photometric fields .",
    "we found @xmath85 .",
    "thus we modified the above calibration procedure by including the zero - points of the photometric fields in the parameters to be fitted and adding the additional constraints that they must lie close to their theoretical values .",
    "in other words we now minimize the quantity @xmath86 where the first sum again runs over all overlap regions and the second sum runs over all photometric fields . in fig .",
    "[ dm_fn](c ) we show @xmath82 for all the overlap regions using the final zero - points .",
    "[ dm_fn](d ) shows the histogram of the individual @xmath87 values .",
    "the width of this distribution indicates an internal photometric accuracy of @xmath88  mag for objects in the range @xmath78  mag . due to the paucity of photometric fields beyond mgc field @xmath89 ( cf .",
    "top panel of fig .",
    "[ obsstat ] ) the absolute calibration in the second half of the survey is less reliable than in the first : up to field @xmath89 the median of the @xmath87 distribution is @xmath90  mag , which is consistent with zero , but beyond field @xmath89 it is @xmath91  mag .",
    "this is needed to reconcile the photometric fields @xmath92 and @xmath93 with the photometric fields at field numbers @xmath94 .    given the above calibration process the relationship between an object s @xmath66 magnitude and its landolt @xmath2 magnitude is given by : @xmath95 where the error on the colour term is @xmath96 .",
    "object extraction was performed using extractor , which is the starlink adapted version of sextractor developed by @xcite .",
    "sextractor initially derives a background map by first defining a grid over the image and then passing a median filter ( set to a size of @xmath97 pixel ) over each pixel within the grid cell .",
    "the local sky within the grid cell is then taken as the mode or @xmath98-clipped mean of the pixel distribution within the cell .",
    "finally , a background map is constructed via a bicubic spline interpolation over these points .",
    "we opted for the largest possible mesh size ( @xmath99 pixel ) to minimize the smoothing out of any extended low surface brightness features .",
    "after convolving the image with a filter , sextractor detects objects as groups of connected pixels above the uniform surface brightness threshold of @xmath100  mag  arcsec@xmath4 .",
    "once an object has been detected sextractor redetects the object using @xmath51 different detection thresholds , which are exponentially spaced between the peak flux value of the object and the detection threshold .",
    "if at any level the object breaks up into two or more disconnected subcomponents , each containing at least @xmath59 per cent of the total flux of the object , then the object is deblended .",
    "this multithresholding is ideally suited for galaxy extraction because no assumptions concerning the shape of the object are being made @xcite .",
    "the photometry was performed using sextractor with a constant analysis isophote of @xmath3  mag  arcsec@xmath4  to provide a uniformly processed catalogue .",
    "four of the various types of magnitudes provided by sextractor are included in the mgc : an isophotal magnitude ( iso ) , a corrected isophotal magnitude ( isocor ) , an adaptive aperture magnitude ( kron ) and a best magnitude ( best ) .",
    "the isocor magnitude is calculated by correcting the iso magnitude for the fraction of the flux outside the limiting isophote assuming a gaussian profile ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein for details ) .",
    "kron magnitudes ( i.e.  elliptical apertures of 2.5 kron radii , @xcite ) are known to underestimate the fluxes in perfect exponential profiles by @xmath101  mag and in de vaucouleur profiles by @xmath102  mag .",
    "nevertheless , they have been shown to be the most robust to variations in redshift , bulge - to - disc ratio , isophotal limit and seeing @xcite .",
    "the best magnitude is taken to be the kron magnitude except in crowded regions where the isocor magnitude is used instead .",
    "all objects are individually corrected for galactic extinction using the dust extinction maps provided by @xcite and adopting @xmath103 . from now on we refer to the best magnitudes before and after extinction correction as @xmath66 and @xmath104 , respectively .",
    "[ plate ] shows a random selection of galaxies in the range @xmath105 to @xmath106  mag .      as a result of the substantial overlap regions ( cf .",
    "[ outline ] ) the catalogue contains many duplicate objects .",
    "these were used in previous sections to verify the astrometry and to calibrate the photometry .",
    "we now remove duplicate detections by imposing ra limits for each field , effectively splitting each overlap region in half .",
    "( note that the ra limits do not apply to objects detected on ccd 3 . ) for a small number of objects , all lying very close to an ra limit , this procedure did not remove one of the duplicate detections , because the two detections happened to lie on either side of the limit .",
    "these cases were fixed by hand .      at this stage",
    "the catalogue contains a total of @xmath107 objects to @xmath108  mag .",
    "the catalogue comprises galaxies , stars and various unwanted objects and artefacts such as satellite trails , ccd defects , cosmic rays , diffraction spikes , asteroids and spurious noise detections . as a starting point for classification",
    "we used the stellaricity parameter provided by sextractor , which is produced for each object by an artificial neural network ( ann ) that has been extensively trained to differentiate between stars and galaxies @xcite .",
    "the input of the ann consists of nine object parameters ( eight isophotal areas and the peak intensity ) and the seeing .",
    "the output consists of a single number , called stellaricity , which takes a value of @xmath47 for stars , @xmath109 for galaxies and intermediate values for more dubious objects . fig .",
    "[ stell ] shows the number of objects as a function of stellaricity and @xmath66 . at @xmath110",
    "mag the stellaricity distribution is clearly bimodal with almost all values at the extremes and so star  galaxy separation is trivial . at fainter magnitudes the star ",
    "galaxy separation requires more effort .",
    "hence we now define two catalogues : mgc - bright , which contains all objects with @xmath111  mag , and mgc - faint which contains the rest .      for mgc - bright",
    "we adopted the following classification strategy .",
    "brighter than @xmath112  mag we classified all objects with stellaricity @xmath113 as stars .",
    "this low stellaricity cut was used because the objects in the upper left - hand corner of fig .",
    "[ stell ] are , in fact , flooded stars . for the rest of mgc - bright",
    "we classified all objects with stellaricity @xmath114 as stars .",
    "this is a ` natural ' value to adopt because the stellaricity distribution rises sharply from @xmath115 to @xmath116 .",
    "all objects so far classified as non - stellar were then inspected visually and classified into one of the following categories : galaxy , star , asteroid , satellite trail , cosmic ray , ccd defect , diffraction spike or spurious noise detection .",
    "incorrectly deblended galaxies were then repaired by hand , but their original catalogue entries were retained and classified as obsolete .",
    "asteroids were verified using images from the supercosmos sky survey ( sss , * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "what are the sources of these uncertainties ?",
    "in addition to the difficulty of reliably calibrating the photometry of large photographic surveys @xcite showed that the derived lf parameters depend on the limiting isophote and the photometric method ( e.g.  isophotal , corrected , total , etc . ) .",

    "[ appbbd ] ( together with visibility theory ) shows that at @xmath159  mag apparently no significant galaxy population below @xmath155  mag  arcsec@xmath4  exists . in other words , at these surface brightness limits it is typically a case of missing light from the outer isophotes rather than missing galaxies : @xcite found only @xmath160 per cent of galaxies missing from the 2dfgrs due to their low surface brightness . however , blended and unresolved objects take the total incompleteness of the 2dfgrs to @xmath161 per cent , which may be indicative of photographic surveys in general .",
    "lss will clearly affect all but the very largest surveys .",
    "@xcite found that the @xmath162  deg@xmath1 overlap region between the sdss - edr and the 2dfgrs was overdense by @xmath163 per cent relative to the full 2dfgrs .",
    "similarly they found a @xmath164 per cent difference ( to @xmath165 ) between their @xmath166  deg@xmath1 ngp and @xmath167  deg@xmath1 sgp regions .",
    "hence it is clear that much shallower surveys like the ssrs2 ( @xmath168  mag ) can not accurately measure @xmath6 even if they have a very large angular size . on the other hand , due to the filamentary structure of the universe even deep surveys are susceptible to lss if they extend only over a small solid angle .",
    "finally , we remark that each of the surveys listed in table [ lumftab ] uses different @xmath145-corrections , and only the 2dfgrs use @xmath147-corrections",
    ". indeed , evolutionary effects , which were ignored by @xcite , are the reason why the sdss - cd normalization is so high . when evolution is included ( or when normalizing to the sdss - edr counts instead of using the method of @xcite ) the sdss - cd normalization agrees much better with the 2dfgrs results @xcite .",
    "although both @xmath119 and @xmath6 appear to contribute equally to the uncertainty in @xmath152 it is customary ( and sensible ) to fix @xmath119 and use @xmath152 to constrain @xmath6 alone instead of a combination like @xmath169 . over the range @xmath31  mag",
    "the mgc arguably provides the most reliable number count data in existence and hence it provides very reliable constraints on @xmath6 .",
    "we now determine @xmath170 as a function of @xmath119 and @xmath18 by fitting the model counts for a given combination of @xmath119 and @xmath18 to the corrected mgc - bright counts over the range @xmath171  mag ( i.e.  the mgc-2dfgrs counts at @xmath172  mag ) , where @xmath6 is the free parameter .",
    "we use the full covariance matrix for the fits .",
    "[ phistar ] shows the result as a contour plot in the @xmath119@xmath18 plane .",
    "in particular , we derive the @xmath170 values appropriate for the lfs listed in table  [ lumftab ] .",

    "[ lumfmod](c ) and ( d ) show the resulting lfs and their predicted counts after revision .",
    "all surveys now give comparable and reasonable probabilities .",
    "note , however , that the variation of @xmath6 among the different surveys after renormalization is no less than before .",
    "this is due to the fact that the counts constrain the combination @xmath169 and that the variation in @xmath173 is comparable to that of @xmath6 before renormalization ( as seen from equation [ nerror ] ) .    in table",
    "[ lumftab ] we also list the errors on @xmath170 induced by various sources .",
    "first , we list the statistical error derived from the @xmath174 fit .",
    "this error includes remaining uncertainties due to lss because we have used the full covariance matrix of the counts in the fit .",
    "secondly , we list the errors due to the uncertainties in @xmath119 and @xmath18 , which can be essentially read off from fig .",
    "[ phistar ] . here",
    "we take into account that the errors on @xmath119 and @xmath18 are generally highly correlated by assuming a correlation coefficient of @xmath175 @xcite .",
    "finally , we have estimated the errors resulting from uncertainties in the @xmath120-correction .",
    "this error is slightly more subtle than the previous ones .",
    "for example , increasing @xmath120 has the effect of moving the contours in fig .",
    "[ phistar ] to the left and up but it also moves the lfs in a similar direction , thus again decreasing the original change in @xmath170 for a given survey .",
    "@xcite estimated errors on their @xmath120-correction by demanding statistical consistency between the lfs derived from their high and low-@xmath143 samples .",
    "since our @xmath120 is essentially identical to theirs we also adopt their error of @xmath176 per cent .",
    "we estimate the resulting @xmath170 error for a given survey by first adding @xmath177 to its @xmath119 value and then re - deriving @xmath170 while using the increased ( or decreased ) @xmath120 . as in section [ modcounts ]",
    "we thus approximate the effect on @xmath119 by evaluating @xmath178 at the median redshift of the survey .",
    "comparison with @xcite s @xmath120 induced error on @xmath119 indicates that this procedure underestimates the effect on @xmath119 , and hence we overestimate the error on @xmath170 .",
    "we also conservatively ignore any effect on @xmath18 , which is difficult to gauge .",
    "taking @xmath179  mag and using the revised lf normalizations we calculate the luminosity density , @xmath180 .",
    "note that we convert @xmath181 to @xmath182 .",
    "the calculated values of @xmath183 are listed in the last column of table  [ lumftab ] , where the errors include all the @xmath119 , @xmath18 and @xmath170 uncertainties while taking into account the correlation between the errors of @xmath119 and @xmath18 ( with a correlation coefficient 0.75 as above ) as well as the virtually perfect correlations between the second error component of @xmath170 and the errors of @xmath119 and @xmath18 and between the @xmath120 errors on @xmath119 and @xmath170 .",
    "we find a weighted mean @xmath15 luminosity density of @xmath184  mpc@xmath17 .",
    "note that the 2dfgrs and sdss - cd , which must be considered the most reliable lfs , give a slightly higher value of @xmath185  mpc@xmath17 .      in the previous section we minimized @xmath174 as a function of @xmath6 only while treating @xmath119 and @xmath18 as fixed parameters .",
    "@xmath6 only affects the normalization of the predicted counts but not their shape which , in principle , also contains information .",
    "however , for the lfs listed in table [ lumftab ] the fits are already statistically acceptable ( cf .  column 9 of table  [ lumftab ] )",
    "and hence we can not expect to derive useful limits on any other parameters .    nevertheless , in fig .",
    "[ phistar ] we mark as grey - shaded regions those combinations of @xmath119 and @xmath18 where the adjustment of @xmath6 does not result in an acceptable fit ( at the @xmath186 and @xmath187 per cent confidence levels ) , i.e.  where the shape of the predicted counts disagrees with the data . as expected these limits can not exclude any of the measured values .",
