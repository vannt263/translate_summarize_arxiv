    "the phenomenon of charge ordering observed in re@xmath0a@xmath1mno@xmath2 where re is a trivalent rare earth ion and a is a divalent alkaline earth ion has been intensively studied for the past few years .",
    "this has been one of the most puzzling of the various properties exhibited by the rare earth manganites such as colossal magneto resistance ( cmr ) , orbital ordering , phase separation and a large number of magnetic and structural transitions as a function of temperature and composition @xcite .",
    "the parent compound remno@xmath2 contains mn@xmath6 ions which have one outermost e@xmath7 electron .",
    "doping with a divalent alkaline earth ion introduces mn@xmath8 with one less electron ( a hole ) and hence manganites with x @xmath9 0.5 are called ` hole - doped ' . coming from the opposite end of the phase diagram the amno@xmath2 compound consists of all mn@xmath8 ions and doping it with a trivalent rare earth ion introduces mn@xmath6 ions and hence e@xmath7 electrons into the system .",
    "therefore , manganites with x @xmath10 0.5 are termed ` electron - doped ' .",
    "interestingly , the phase diagram is not symmetric across x = 0.5 concentration though the number of charge carriers on both sides of x = 0.5 vary in a symmetric manner . broadly speaking ,",
    "the x @xmath9 0.5 region in the phase diagrams of the manganites is dominated by ferromagnetic interaction whereas x @xmath10 0.5 region is characterised by charge ordering .",
    "the phase diagram of pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( pcmo ) shows charge ordering in the 0.3 @xmath9 x @xmath9 0.8 composition regime .",
    "however , the asymmetry of the phase diagram persists even in the charge ordered ( co ) state of x @xmath9 0.5 e.g. x=0.36(pcmo - h ) and x @xmath10 0.5 compound e.g. x=0.64 ( pcmo - e ) .",
    "the properties of the co state are quite different in the two compounds .",
    "the charge ordering transition temperature t@xmath4 for pcmo - h is 210 k whereas that for pcmo - e is 268 k. charge ordering in the former can be melted into a ferromagnetic metallic state by doping with ions such as cr@xmath6 and ru@xmath8by the application of magnetic fields whereas no such signs of melting of charge order are observed in pcmo - e .",
    "the cause of these differences has been attributed to the intrinsic differences in the electronic structure of the two types of systems@xcite .",
    "electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) has proved to be a valuable tool in the study of the manganites . through a study of the temperature and composition dependence of various epr parameters such as the linewidth and the intensity across the various transitions",
    "valuable information has been obtained regarding the interplay of different interactions in the systems @xcite .",
    "however most of these studies relate to cmr manganites and there are comparatively very few published reports of epr studies of co manganites @xcite.to the best of our knowledge , there has been no report of a comparative study of electron and hole - doped manganites .",
    "since the asymmetry in the phase diagram across x=0.5 is an interesting aspect of the physics of manganites , we compare the epr results on the electron - doped manganite pr@xmath11ca@xmath12mno@xmath2 ( pcmo - e ) with those reported by us earlier @xcite on the hole - doped pr@xmath13ca@xmath14mno@xmath2 ( pcmo - h ) with a view to understanding this asymmetry as reflected in the epr parameters and their temperature dependence .",
    "single crystals of pcmo - e were prepared by the float zone technique .",
    "resistivity measurements show an increase in the resistivity at t@xmath15 = 268 k. magnetization measurements show a peak in the susceptibility also at 268 k. however no peak in the susceptibility was observed at t@xmath16 unlike in pcmo - h .",
    "the epr experiments were carried out on both single crystal and powder samples of pcmo - e using a bruker x - band spectrometer ( model 200d ) equipped with an oxford instruments continuous flow cryostat ( model esr 900 ) .",
    "the spectrometer was modified by connecting the x and y inputs of the chart recorder to a 12 bit a / d converter which in turn is connected to a pc enabling digital data acquisition . with this accessory , for the scanwidth typically used for our experiments i.e 6000 gauss",
    ", one could determine the magnetic field to a precision of 3 gauss .",
    "for single crystal study the static magnetic field was kept parallel to the c - axis of the crystal .",
    "experiments were also performed with another orientation ( h @xmath17 a ) to check for any anisotropy in the esr response . for measurements on powder ,",
    "the finely ground sample was dispersed in paraffin wax.the temperature was varied from 4.2 k to room temperature ( accuracy : @xmath18 ) and the epr spectra were recorded while warming the sample .",
    "signals could be recorded only for temperatures t @xmath10 200 k below which signals had very poor signal to noise ratio . while doing experiments on both the single crystal and the powder , a speck of dpph was used as a g - marker . to carry out the lineshape fitting ( to be described below ) the signal due to dpph was subtracted digitally .",
    "figure 1a shows some representative epr spectra recorded on the single crystal of pcmo - e .",
    "the signals are dysonian in shape and are fitted to the equation@xcite @xmath19    where @xmath20h is the full width at half intensity , h@xmath21 is the resonance field and @xmath5 is the asymmetry parameter which is the fraction of the dispersion component of lorentzian added to the absorption component resulting in the dysonian lineshape . in equation 1",
    "the first term represents the signal response due to the component of microwaves that is polarised clockwise and the second term represents the response to the component polarised anticlockwise .",
    "@xmath22 where the symbols have the same meanings as in equation 1 .",
    "the two terms are incorporated for the same reason as mentioned above .",
    "the lineshape parameters obtained by fitting are plotted in figures 2 , 3 and 4 along with the data of pcmo - h    the single crystal parameters g , peak to peak linewidth @xmath20h@xmath23(= @xmath20h / @xmath24 ) and the asymmetry parameter @xmath5 obtained from the fits to equation 1 are plotted in figure 2 against temperature .",
    "the single crystal data of pcmo - h are also plotted in the same figure for the purpose of comparison .    as can be seen from figure 2a ,",
    "the value of ` g ' ( 2.002 ) in pcmo - h at room temperature is higher than that in pcmo - e ( 1.999 ) which is less than the free electron value .",
    "the ` g ' value in pcmo - e ( fig .",
    "2a , solid squares ) increases only slightly as the temperature is lowered from room temperature to t@xmath4 below which it decreases sharply .",
    "it reaches a value of 1.94 at 200 k. this temperature dependence is quite different from that observed in the case of pcmo - h ( fig .",
    "2a ) where it remains nearly temperature independent in the paramagnetic phase , i.e , from room temperature to t@xmath4 , below which it decreases sharply to a value less than the free electron ` g ' value , ` g@xmath3 ' . with further reduction in temperature , the ` g ' value increases monotonically .",
    "the linewidth ( fig .",
    "2b ) also behaves differently in the two manganites . in pcmo",
    "- e it shows a slight monotonic decrease down to 245 k below which it shows a smooth , sharper increase . in pcmo - h on the other hand , there is a sharp discontinuous increase at t@xmath4 and a monotonic increase at lower temperatures .",
    "the asymmetry parameter @xmath5 plotted in figure 2c exhibits marked differences between the two samples . while it increases abruptly at t@xmath4 in pcmo - h , in pcmo - e it remains temperature independent till well below t@xmath4 , i.e , down to 245 k and then decreases monotonically below that temperature . in pcmo - h on the other hand throughout the temperature below t@xmath4 , @xmath5 decreases monotonically .    in figure 3",
    ", we show the results from the powder spectra of pcmo - h and pcmo - e .",
    "the ` g ' values plotted in figure 3a show a monotonic increase as the temperature is reduced from room temperature in both the compounds .",
    "the magnitude of ` g ' in the former is however greater than ` g@xmath3 ' throughout the temperature range whereas in the latter it shows a crossover from less than ` g@xmath3 ' to a value larger than ` g@xmath3 ' near t@xmath4 . also , the temperature dependence of ` g ' in the two samples is qualitatively different .",
    "the variation of ` g ' from room temperature down to t@xmath16 is much larger in pcmo - e than in pcmo - h .",
    "another noteworthy point is that the temperature dependences of ` g ' in the powder and single crystal of pcmo - e are opposite to each other .",
    "moreno et al .",
    ", @xcite observed an anisotropy in the temperature dependence of ` g ' in single crystals of layered manganite la@xmath25sr@xmath26mn@xmath27o@xmath28 .",
    "they observed that on decreasing the temperature ` g ' increases with t for h@xmath29a but decreases with t for h@xmath29c . in order to examine the possibility of such an anisotropy in the single crystal of pcmo - e",
    ", we repeated the experiment for h@xmath29a and found that there was no anisotropy in the variation of ` g ' with temperature .",
    "so the reasons for the difference between behaviour of ` g ' in the single crystal and the powder of pcmo - e are not clear at present .",
    "the dependence of the peak to peak linewidth @xmath20h@xmath23 on temperature shown in figure 3b for pcmo - h and pcmo - e also shows a difference below t@xmath4 in that the curvatures of the two are opposite to each other .",
    "the variation in linewidth is again larger in pcmo - e than in pcmo - h .",
    "the epr intensities for the two samples are plotted in figures 3c against temperature . in both the samples",
    ", the intensity goes through a peak at t@xmath4 , decreasing monotonically below this temperature .",
    "however , the sharp drop in intensity found at @xmath30 t@xmath4 ( 240 k ) in the case of pcmo - h is not seen in pcmo - e",
    ".    now we attempt to understand these results in the light of the microscopic phenomena occurring in these systems .",
    "we focus on the temperature variation of ` g ' in the powder sample and that of @xmath20h and @xmath5 in single crystals .",
    "it was earlier observed by us that the hole - doped charge ordering systems exhibit certain tell - tale epr signatures :    1 .",
    "it was noted that ` g ' ( @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the spin - orbit coupling constant , @xmath33 is a positive numerical factor and @xmath20 is the crystal field splitting ) , even in the charge disordered paramagnetic state , is larger than ` g@xmath3 ' and on cooling stays independent of temperature till t@xmath4 .",
    "below t@xmath4 it becomes very sensitive to temperature and goes on increasing with decreasing temperature .",
    "the anomalous ` g ' shift ( since for both mn@xmath6 and mn@xmath8 ` g ' is expected to be lower than ` g@xmath3 ' ) can be attributed to the ` hole ' nature of the charge carriers since for holes in a less than half filled shell the spin - orbit coupling constant @xmath34 is negative @xcite .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the present observation that in the system with electrons as charge carriers , ` g ' is less than ` g@xmath3 ' in the charge disordered state .",
    "the increase in ` g ' below t@xmath4 found in pcmo - h and ndcamno@xmath2 ( ncmo)@xcite was attributed to the strengthening of the spin - orbit interaction due to orbital ordering developing between t@xmath4 and t@xmath16",
    ". however , the fact that ` g ' crosses over to a value greater than ` g@xmath3 ' in the electron - doped system and continues to increase as the temperature is lowered below t@xmath4 indicates that an essentially different mechanism is operative in the electron - doped system .",
    "this is consistent with the suggestion by khomskii@xcitethat in these systems the concept of orbital ordering can not be strictly applied .",
    "2 .   in the hole - doped pcmo and",
    "ncmo the dependence of @xmath20h on t in the single crystals in the region t@xmath16 @xmath35 t@xmath4 could be explained in terms of a model involving motional narrowing@xcite .",
    "hopping of the jan - teller polarons was understood to be the underlying mechanism of charge transport .",
    "however , we notice in figs .",
    "2b , 3b and 4 that @xmath20h _ vs _ t of pcmo - e and pcmo - h have different functional dependences on temperature .",
    "interestingly we observe that the temperature dependence of @xmath36 is the same as the temperature dependence of @xmath20h@xmath23 of single crystal as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "we find that both the resistivity and the single crystal epr linewidth fit the model of variable range hopping ( vrh)(solid line in fig 4 ) given by equation @xmath37 vrh has been used to explain the resistivity of manganites in the paramagnetic state by viret et al . , @xcite using the concept of magnetic localisation .",
    "they found that the density of states gets modified consequent to the localisation of charge carriers due to hund s coupling between the itinerant e@xmath7 electrons and the stationary , core t@xmath38 spins .",
    "this lead to the realisation of a random potential in the paramagnetic state . in case of co manganites , in the charge ordered state a long ranged afm order is not established .",
    "so the concept of random magnetic potential can be applied . from the vrh fit we obtained the parameter t@xmath21 .",
    "the localisation length is given by @xmath39 { k.t_0\\over{171.u_m.v } } $ ] where k is the boltzmann factor , @xmath40 is the random magnetic potential which is of the order of 2 ev ( hund s coupling ) and @xmath41 is the volume of the unit cell per manganese ion which is @xmath42 .",
    "the numerical factor 171 comes from the geometrical corrections due to the symmetry of @xmath43 orbital of e@xmath7 electron and the probability that an unoccupied manganese orbital can accept an electron .",
    "the localisation length for pcmo - e thus obtained is 0.3 nm which is larger than the mn ionic radius ( @xmath30 0.8 a@xmath44 ) as expected in vrh model .",
    "while the vrh fit to @xmath20h@xmath23 _ vs _ t in pcmo - e is seen to be excellent , the model did not fit the linewidth data of pcmo - h well ( dotted line in figure 4 ) , the regression coefficient indicative of the goodness of fit being 0.91 in the latter compared to 0.99 for the fit to the data of pcmo - e .",
    "the same conclusion i.e. the applicability of the model of motional narrowing in the case of pcmo - e is borne out by the behaviour of @xmath5 as well . in case of pcmo - h",
    "an anomalous peak is observed in @xmath5 _ vs _ t at t@xmath4 .",
    "no such peak is observed in pcmo - e where @xmath5 decreases smoothly as @xmath36 increases below t@xmath4 as expected . in pcmo - h ,",
    "the peak in @xmath5 was found to be correlated with the motion of the jahn - teller polarons .",
    "the absence of such a peak in pcmo - e again points towards the negligible contribution of jahn - teller polaron - mediated charge transport in this system .          c. n. r. rao and b. raveau ( eds ) , _ colossal magnetoresistance , charge ordering and related properties of manganese oxides _  ( world scientific , singapore , 1998 ) .",
