    "the idea of nonfactorization in @xmath5 and @xmath2 decays was introduced in the last few years by several authors @xcite .",
    "there are two equivalent ways of introducing nonfactorized contributions in a calculation : either , use the number of colors , @xmath6 equal to 3 and explicitly add a nonfactorized contribution to each lorentz scalar in the decay amplitude as in @xcite , or introduce an effective number of colors , @xmath7 .",
    "the later approach has been adopted in several papers @xcite dealing with @xmath2 decays into light mesons .",
    "though the nonfactorized amplitude remains incalculable , a few statements about it can be made .",
    "first , what is estimated to be the nonfactorized contribution depends on the model of form factors used to calculate the factorized contribution .",

    "third , if nonfactorization is characterized through an effective number of colors , @xmath7 , is it the same ( as assumed in @xcite and @xcite ) for the tree and the penguin generated processes or different ( as in @xcite ) ?",
    "@xcite goes so far as to suggest that @xmath7 , is different for the @xmath8 and @xmath9 type of penguin terms . in the language of @xcite , where @xmath10 is assumed , different @xmath7 , for the tree and penguin diagram driven processes",
    "imply that the nonfactorized contributions for the tree and penguin driven diagram processes are different .",
    "this is not unlikely as the calculation of the penguin diagram driven amplitudes in the factorization assumption involves additional assumptions , an effective value of @xmath11 for example . in a complete calculation",
    "@xcite there are no such free momentum choices left .",
    "unlike the papers listed in @xcite , in this paper we study @xmath2 decays into a heavy and a light meson . as such they are all cabibbo - favored @xmath12 transitions .",
    "following , @xcite we use @xmath10 and introduce nonfactorized contributions explicitly . in order to evaluate the factorized contributions we use the bauer - stech - wirbel ( bsw ) model @xcite to calculate the form factors at @xmath13 but",

    ", we assume that the nonfactorized effects associated with the three lorentz - scalar structures in @xmath14 decays are the same . using experimental data",
    ", we then calculate the average overall nonfactorization factors for color - favored @xmath15 and @xmath16 processes .",

    "this results in lower values for the branching ratios and poor agreement with experiment supporting our choice of the solution in area 3 as discussed in the previous section .    finally , we calculated the effect of nonfactorization contribution on the branching ratios of three sets of @xmath128 decays .",

    "however , due to the limited data , it is difficult to make a strong statement about the validity of the factorization approach in predicting the polarizations of @xmath130 decays .",
    "it is interesting to note that if we extrapolate all the form factors as monoples ( the so called bsw ii model ) the predictions for the polarizations in @xmath131 , @xmath121 and @xmath129 are in much better agreement with data , even though bsw ii model fares much better in predicting the branching ratios . for the record",
    ", the longitudinal polarizations predicted in bsw i model for the above three decays are 0.87 , 0.57 and 0.55 respectively",
    "strictly speaking , we know that the factorization assumption can not be correct .",
    "this is because it produces a scale dependent transition amplitude .",
