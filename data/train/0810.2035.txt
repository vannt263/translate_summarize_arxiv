    "a small fraction can arise from intergalactic space . in the galactic midplane , the interstellar x - ray absorption column density , @xmath5 ,",
    "is @xmath6 even in the anti - center direction .",
    "therefore , the extragalactic x - ray photons below 1  kev are totally blocked .",
    "nevertheless , the r45 band x - ray surface brightness decreases only by 20 % or less from high galactic latitude to midplane .",
    "this issue has been known as the `` m band problem '' @xcite .",
    "the m band is the name of a similar energy band in the wisconsin and the nagoya - leiden rocket programs .",
    "since x - ray photons below 1  kev can travel only about 1  kpc in the galactic disk , there must be emission in the midplane within 1  kpc which compensates partly the decrease of the extragalactic emission . @xcite and",
    "@xcite suggested hot gas of @xmath7  k as the origin , while @xcite pointed out emission from dm stars can contribute @xmath8 % of the total diffuse emission .",
    "@xcite showed that if a significant fraction ( @xmath9 ) of emission originates from hot gas in the temperature range of @xmath10 to @xmath11 k , the hot gas must expand because of its high pressure .",
    "he suggested young expanding superbubbles or supernova remnants evolving in low density region as candidates for the emission .",
    "as an example , the surface brightness averaged over rectangular areas of @xmath12 along the line of @xmath13 is plotted as a function of @xmath1 in figure   [ fig : r45map ] . a model surface brightness profile consisting of an unabsorbed constant emission and the cxb absorbed by the average column density is plotted together with the observational data . for @xmath14 , there is @xmath15 of excess over the model .",
    "this corresponds to about 20% of the total diffuse emission at high latitudes .",
    "note that the model curve is for the minimum possible absorption : if the other 60% of the r45 emission at high latitudes is produced by a hot halo , then this too would be largely absorbed in the plane , depending on its scale height structure .",
    "the surface brightness profile suggests asymmetry between the profiles for @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which is more pronounced in r4 band . in this paper",
    ", however , we concentrate on the excess flux at @xmath18 . in section [ sec : discussion ] , we will construct a model which can consistently explain the excess at @xmath18 , although we will find the model can not explain the excess in @xmath4 .",

    "one major reason is that there has been no energy spectrum available in which emission line structures are resolved .",
    "the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ) @xcite on board suzaku @xcite has a significantly improved spectral line response function compared to previous x - ray ccd cameras , e.g. those onboard _",
    "xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ , in particular below 1  kev .",
    "although the spectral resolution of the instrument is not high enough to resolve the fine structure ( triplet ) of ovii@xmath2 emission , emissions from different ions , e.g. nvi , ovii , and oviii , can be clearly resolved .",
    "combined with the x - ray telescope @xcite , the xis also has high sensitivity for spatially extended emission .",
    "we have observed the direction ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) = ( 235 , 0 ) with suzaku for 160 ks .",
    "the direction was selected because this point is well outside the galactic bulge and north polar spur , and because the direction is an average midplane direction without any special features , i.e. no bright x - sources in the xis field of view , a typical neutral hydrogen density , and a typical counting rate in the rosat all sky survey map .",
    "we found that theovii @xmath2 emission intensity was comparable with that of the mbm-12 on - cloud observation @xcite and that a narrow bump peaked at @xmath3 0.9  kev was compensating the decrease of the extragalactic component .",
    "this strong feature , presumably due to a blend of ne - k and fe - l lines , makes the @xmath19 spectrum qualitatively unlike empty - field spectra at other latitudes and requires plasma at higher temperatures than generally seen in galactic diffuse emission . in this paper",
    "we will show the observational results and discuss the origin of the excess emission .",
    "we will construct a model spectrum for spatially unresolved faint dm stars and show it can consistently explain the observations .",

    "we have carefully excluded the time intervals of the observation in which the data could be contaminated by swcx in the upper atmosphere of the earth ( the geocoronal swcx ) . however , the swcx in interplanetary space ( the heliospheric swcx ) can not be excluded .",

    "the average agn spectra below @xmath3 1  kev becomes steeper than above @xmath3 1  kev , and the average photon index was determined to be 1.96 below @xmath3 1  kev by @xcite .",
    "we thus first tried three different models for this component : a power - law function with a photon index 1.4 , and broken power - law functions with indices of either 1.54 or 1.96 below 1.2  kev and with 1.4 above 1.2  kev @xcite .",
    "we set the normalization of the power - law or the broken power - law models free .",
    "we found all parameters of model ( a ) including the normalization of the cxb at 1  kev were same within the statistical errors for these three cxb models .",
    "therefore we will show only the results with the single power - law function .",
    "the best - fit value of the power - law normalization is consistent with typical high latitude values @xcite .",
    "the intensity of the cxb component decreases rapidly below @xmath57  kev because of galactic absorption and has negligible contribution below 1  kev .",
    "the second component is a thin thermal emission model , apec ( http://hea-www.harvard.edu/apec/ ) , which we consider to represent the emission from hot gas in the local hot bubble ( lhb ) and from the swcx process in the heliosphere .",
    "we estimated ovii @xmath2 emission intensity by setting the o abundance of this apec model to zero and substituting with a narrow gaussian line at theovii @xmath2 line energy , fixing the temperature of the emission component to the best fit value .",
    "theovii @xmath2 emission intensity was determined to be @xmath58 lu , where lu is @xmath59 .",
    "this value is smaller than theovii @xmath2 emission intensity obtained from the mbm-12 on - cloud observation by @xcite with suzaku ( @xmath60 lu ) .",
    "mbm-12 is located at 60 to 280 pc from the earth , and theovii @xmath2 emission beyond the cloud is completely blocked .",
    "thus the intensity represents the emission from the lhb and heliospheric swcx .",
    "@xcite determined the emission intensity by fitting the spectrum with a power - law continuum and gaussian lines .",
    "however the emission intensity is dependent on how we describe the weak lines .",
    "furthermore , both the data processing and the calibration of the instruments have been improved since the analysis by @xcite .",
    "we thus re - analyzed the data and determined the emission intensity using the same recipe used here .",
    "we employed the same models to describe the cxb and the point source in the field of view as @xcite .",
    "we found the lhb + swcx component of the mbm-12 on - cloud direction is well described with an apec model without absorption with k@xmath61  kev , and normalization = @xmath62 .",
    "the ovii @xmath2 emission was determined to be @xmath63 lu .",
    "both the apec model parameters and the ovii @xmath2 emission intensities are consistent with the present midplane observation .",
    "the third component is an apec thin thermal emission model at a higher temperature need to produce the bump peaked at around 0.9  kev . in this model",
    "the broad feature is produced by a sum of fe - l and ne - k lines .",
    "we had to set the the o abundance of this component free in order to better describe the oviii @xmath2 emission .",
    "the best fit values of the temperature and the o abundance were respectively @xmath64  kev and @xmath65 solar .",
    "although the @xmath55 value of the fit is statistically acceptable , we find excess emission in the 1 - 1.2  kev range , which suggests existence of even higher temperature emission .",
    "the large required o abundance also suggests existence of a lower - temperature component which emitsoviii @xmath2 emission more efficiently .",
    "thus , the narrow bump at around 0.9  kev is likely multi - temperature emission . in the second model ( model b )",
    ", we represented the narrow bump with two apec components with the abundance fixed to 1 .",
    "we found the fitting is unstable because of strong coupling among the two apec components and the other remaining two components .",
    "we thus fixed the normalization of the cxb power - law function , and the temperature of the lhb + swcx component to the best fit values of model ( a ) , respectively . in table",
    "[ tbl : specfit ] , we show the best fit parameters . the temperatures of the emissions were @xmath66 and @xmath67  kev , respectively .",
    "the narrow bump at around 0.9  kev may be represented by other model functions .",
    "for example , if it is a sum of emissions from faint x - ray binaries , it may be modeled with continuum spectra .",
    "thus , as the third model , model ( c ) , we tried to fit with a strongly absorbed continuum spectrum .",
    "as the continuum we adopted a bremsstrahlung model . as shown in table   [ tbl : specfit ] , the spectrum was fitted well with model parameters of @xmath68 and absorption column density @xmath69 .    finally , we divided the xis image regions into two subregions and extracted the energy spectra separately .",
    "we found that the two spectra were identical to each other and to the total spectrum within the statistical errors .",
    "this suggests the emission region of the narrow bump is not localized within a limited image region , but spatially extended at least to the size of the xis field of view ( 18 ) .",
    "the pointing direction of the present observation has no special features .",
    "thus we can consider the spectrum to be representative of midplane , off - center directions .",
    "therefore a similar narrow - bump emission is likely to fill partly the absorption of the extragalactic component in other midplane directions , although more observations of different midplane directions are necessary to confirm this assumption .",
    "first we consider spatially extended hot plasma as the origin . assuming an average interstellar neutral h density of 1 @xmath70 and cosmic abundance , the absorption length of a 0.9 kev photon is estimated to be 1 kpc in midplane .",
    "thus the line of depth of the observation , @xmath71 , is about 1  kpc .",
    "then the local h density of the plasma , @xmath72 , is estimated from the best fit model parameters of model ( a ) to be @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the volume filling factor .",
    "the pressure is then @xmath75 .",
    "since @xmath76 , the pressure is likely to exceed the total midplane pressure derived from the vertical matter density and the vertical gravity , @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "we thus consider that a large fraction of the emission might arise from faint individual sources rather than diffuse gas .",
    "the faint sources must satisfy the following three conditions : ( 1 ) the sources have to have energy spectra which can be approximated either by a thin - thermal emission ( k@xmath78  kev ) or by an absorbed ( @xmath79 ) bremsstrahlung ( k@xmath80  kev ) , ( 2 ) individual sources must be faint and enough number of sources exist in the xis field of view ( 18 @xmath81 18 ) , and ( 3 ) the sources must have a relatively small vertical scale height so that the emission is enhanced only near the galactic plane .    if we require at least 30 sources in the xis field of view with a line - of - sight depth of 1  kpc , we need x - ray sources with a density higher than 0.003  pc@xmath82",
    ". only normal stars and white dwarfs have high enough spatial densities . among those objects ,",
    "the contribution of main sequence m stars ( dm stars ) dominates the emission in the 0.3 to 1  kev energy range because they have relatively high x - ray luminosities and high number density @xcite .",
    "young ( @xmath83  1  gy ) stars have a large x - ray luminosity and dominate the total x - ray emission .",
    "they have a small vertical scale heights ( a few 10 s pc , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite determined the energy spectra of six nearby ( @xmath84 pc ) dm stars with rosat pspc observations .",
    "the spectra were found to consist of two thermal components .",
    "the average temperatures were k@xmath85 and 0.78  kev , respectively , when they were fitted with solar - abundance plasma models .",
    "the two components have comparable emission measures .",
    "the high resolution spectrometers onboard chandra and xmm - newton observatories resolved the emission spectra into number of emission lines @xcite . @xcite determined the emission measure distribution ( emd ) as a function of temperature for the dm3e star , ad leo .",
    "the emd show two peaks at @xmath86 and @xmath87 , thus at k@xmath35 = 0.14 kev and 0.68 kev , which is consistent with the two temperature model from the rosat observations .",
    "the temperature of the higher - temperature component is consistent with that producing the narrow bump in the spectrum of present observation .",
    "the lower temperature component of dm stars emits mostly ovii @xmath2 in the xis band . because opacity at ovii is about twice as high as that for 0.9  kev photons ,",
    "the line - of - sight depth contributing to the present observation is a factor of two shorter .",
    "thus if we assume the narrow - bump emission arises from the 0.78  kev component of dm stars , we find the ovii @xmath2 emission intensity from the 0.14  kev component of dm star is only about 30% of that of the lhb + hs - swcx component , which is within the statistical error of the intensity .",
    "thus the existence of the m - star s lower - temperature component in the present observed spectrum is statistically acceptable .",
    "@xcite also suggested that the intensity of the higher temperature component shows positive correlation with x - ray intensity during flare events .",
    "the emd of ad leo obtained with the chandra grating observation is extended at temperatures above the peak at 0.68 kev up to @xmath88 kev .",
    "van den besselaar et al .",
    "( 2003 ) showed that the emd of ad leo is significantly enhanced in the temperature range of k@xmath35 = 1 - 2 kev during the decay of a flare .",
    "@xcite detected a flare from the nearby m star , ross 154 with chandra acis and found that the temperature of the higher temperature component increased during the flare when it was fitted with a two component model . during the decay phase of the flare , the temperature was 1.9 kev and",
    "the emission measure increased by a factor of about three compared to that during quiescence .",
    "the higher temperature ( k@xmath35 = 1.5 kev ) component in model ( b ) has an emission measure comparable to that of 0.7 kev component",
    ". this could be the contribution of high temperature emission in emd of dm stars in quiescence and flare .",
    "the emission measure in 1 to 2 kev range is about 0.3 times that in 0.7 to 0.9 kev range for ad leo . then if about 20 % of dm stars in the field of view are in flaring state , the 1.5 kev component can be explained .",

    "@xmath110 and @xmath111 are , respectively , the emission measure of the average luminosity star and spatial density of class @xmath109 .",
    "the emission spectrum from a plasma with a temperature of @xmath35 and unit emission measure is given by @xmath112 , and @xmath113 and @xmath114 are respectively the x - ray absorption coefficient and the neutral hydrogen density .",
    "finally , @xmath115 is the distance within which dm stars are resolved as individual stars .",
    "we varied it from 5 pc to 20 pc and found there was no significant difference in the resultant model spectra .",
    "we performed spectral fits using the model function @xmath116 instead of a thin thermal emission model for the narrow bump in model ( a ) . in the fit , we introduced a scaling parameter for @xmath116 and set it free .",
    "we also set the normalization factors of the lhb+swcx and the cxb components free .",
    "the result is shown in figure   [ fig : spectrum_mstar ] .",
    "a minimum @xmath55 value of 87.87 with 87 degrees of freedom was obtained for a scaling parameter value of @xmath117 .",
    "the normalization of both the cxb component ( @xmath118 ) and the lhb+swcx component ( @xmath119 ) were smaller than that of model ( a ) , however their differences are within the statistical errors . therefore ,",
    "both the surface brightness and spectrum of the diffuse emission at ( @xmath120 ) = ( 235 , 0 ) can be consistently explained by introducing the unresolved emission from dm stars .    in figure  [",
    "fig : mstar_flux ] , we show the dm star model fluxes in the rosat r45 band as functions of @xmath1 for @xmath121 . we also show the residuals of the observed rosat r45 band flux from the unabsorbed constant emission + cxb model in figure  [ fig : r45map ] . as shown in this figure , the dm star emissision can fill in the notch in @xmath122 , as well as providing the high - temperature feature seen in the suzaku observation .",
    "however , there exists more excess flux at @xmath4 than the dm star model predicts .",
    "thus yet another emission component which should have a double - peaked latitude structure must fill the notch .",
    "more suzaku observations in @xmath123 are necessary to elucidate this unknown emission component ."
