    "although the low - energy supersymmetry ( susy ) is attractive from the points of view of , for example , naturalness , gauge coupling unification , dark matter , and so on , to which the standard model ( sm ) has no clue , no signal of the susy particles has been observed yet .",
    "thus , one of the important questions in the study of models with low - energy susy is the scale of susy particles .",
    "it is well - known that the observed higgs mass of @xmath7 @xcite gives information about the mass scale of susy particles ( in particular , stops ) .",
    "the higgs mass is enhanced by radiative corrections when the stop masses are much larger than the electroweak scale @xcite .",
    "thus , the stop masses are bounded from above in order not to push up the higgs mass too much ; the stop masses are required to be smaller than @xmath8 as far as @xmath1 , which is the ratio of the vacuum expectation value of the up - type higgs to that of the down - type higgs , is larger than a few .",
    "( for the recent study of such an upper bound , see , for example , @xcite . )",
    "then , too large gluino masses are also disfavored because , via renormalization group ( rg ) effects , it results in stops which are too heavy to make the higgs mass consistent with the observed value .",
    "such an upper bound on the gluino mass is important for the future collider experiments , in particular , for the lhc run-2 , in order to discover and to study models with low energy susy .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to investigate how such an upper bound on the gluino mass depends on the particle content of the model .",
    "we pay particular attention to susy models with extra vector - like chiral multiplets which have sm gauge quantum numbers . in these days",
    ", such extra vector - like matters are particularly motivated from the excess of the diphoton events observed by the lhc @xcite . the most popular idea to explain the diphoton excess is to introduce a scalar boson @xmath9 with which the lhc diphoton excess can be due to the process @xmath10 .",
    "in such a class of scenarios , vector - like particles which interact with @xmath9 are necessary to make @xmath9 being coupled to the sm gauge bosons . indeed , it has been shown that the lhc diphoton excess are well explained in susy models with vector - like chiral multiplets @xcite . assuming a perturbative gauge coupling unification at the gut scale of @xmath11,for the perturbativity bounds on models with extra matters , see @xcite .",
    "three or four copies of the vector - like multiplets , which transform @xmath12 and @xmath13 in @xmath14 gauge group , are suggested , and their masses need to be around or less than 1tev .",
    "in addition , the vector - like chiral multiplets are also motivated in models with non - anomalous discrete @xmath15-symmetry @xcite .    with extra vector - like chiral multiplets , the rg evolutions of the coupling constants and mass parameters of the susy models drastically change compared to those in the minimal susy sm ( mssm ) .",
    "consequently , as we will see , the upper bound on the gluino mass becomes significantly reduced if there exist extra vector - like chiral multiplets .",
    "such an effect has been discussed in gaugino mediation model @xcite and in the light of recent diphoton excess at the lhc @xcite .    in this letter , we study the upper bound on the gluino mass in susy models with extra vector - like matters , assuming more general framework of susy breaking .",
    "we extend the previous analysis and derive the upper bound on the gluino mass .",
    "we will show that the bound on the gluino mass is generically reduced with the addition of extra matters .",
    "the upper bound becomes lower as the number of extra matters increases , and the bound can be as low as a few tev which is within the reach of the lhc run-2 experiment .",
    "we first explain how the upper bound on the gluino mass is reduced in models with extra vector - like multiplets . to make our discussion concrete",
    ", we consider models with extra chiral multiplets which can be embedded into complete @xmath14 fundamental or anti - fundamental representation as @xmath16 and @xmath17 ; we introduce @xmath18 copies of @xmath12 and @xmath13 with @xmath19.our results are qualitatively unchanged even if the vector - like matters are embedded into other representations of @xmath14 , as far as the parameter @xmath18 is properly interpreted . for the case with @xmath20 copies of @xmath21 and @xmath22 representations , for example",
    ", @xmath18 should be replaced by @xmath23 .",
    "then , the superpotential is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a superpotential of the mssm and @xmath26 is the common masses for vector - like matter fields.due to the rg runnings , the susy invariant masses for @xmath27 and @xmath28 should differ even if they are unified at the gut scale .",
    "such an effect is , however , unimportant for our following discussion , and we neglect the mass difference among the extra matters .",
    "hereafter , @xmath26 ( = @xmath29=@xmath30 ) is taken to be @xmath31 , while @xmath32 and @xmath33 , which are suggested by , for example , the diphoton excess observed by the lhc @xcite.the case of @xmath32 is particularly interesting , since it may be embedded into an @xmath34 gut @xcite . in order to see how the upper bound on the gluino mass is derived ,",
    "it is instructive to see the leading one - loop correction to the higgs mass . assuming that the left- and right - handed stop masses are almost degenerate , the higgs boson mass with the leading one - loop corrections in the decoupling limit is estimated as  @xcite @xmath35 ,    \\label{mh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the @xmath37-boson mass",
    ", @xmath38 is the top mass , @xmath39 is the stop mass , @xmath40 gev is the vacuum expectation value of the higgs boson , and @xmath41 ( with @xmath42 being the trilinear coupling of stops normalized by the top yukawa coupling constant @xmath43 , and @xmath44 being the higgsino mass ) . notice that the first term in the square bracket of eq . is the effect of the rg running of the quartic sm higgs coupling constant from the mass scale of the susy particles to the electroweak scale , while the second one is the threshold correction at the mass scale of the susy particles .",
    "the higgs mass becomes larger as @xmath39 or @xmath45 increases ( as far as @xmath46 ) .",
    "thus , in order to realize the observed value of the higgs mass , @xmath47 gev , there is an upper - bound on @xmath39 and @xmath45 .",
    "importantly , the stop masses and the @xmath42 parameter are enhanced with larger value of the gluino mass because of the rg runnings from a high scale to the mass scale of susy particles .",
    "consequently , with boundary conditions on the mssm parameters given at a high scale , we obtain the upper bound on the gluino mass to have @xmath48 .",
    "hereafter , we assume that the mssm is valid up to the gut scale @xmath49 and derive such an upper bound .",
    "now we consider how the existence of the extra matters affects the upper bound on the gluino mass by using one - loop rg equations ( rges ) , although two - loop rges are used for our numerical calculation in the next section . with @xmath18 pairs of the vector - like multiplets , rges of gauge",
    "coupling constants at the one - loop level are @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a renormalization scale ; @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are gauge coupling constants of @xmath55 ( in @xmath14 gut normalization ) , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "in addition , @xmath58 . for @xmath59tev , @xmath60 needs to be satisfied under the condition that the coupling constants remain perturbative up to the gut scale ( @xmath61gev ) .",
    "as one can see , for @xmath62 , @xmath54 is not asymptotically free .",
    "one - loop rges of gaugino masses are @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the bino , wino and gluino mass , respectively .",
    "( hereafter , we use the convention in which @xmath66 is real and positive . )",
    "the ratio @xmath67 is constant at the one - loop level and , with @xmath68 at the mass scale of the susy particles being fixed , the gaugino masses at higher scale are more enhanced with larger value of @xmath18 . in particular , for @xmath69 , the gluino mass , whose rg effects on @xmath42 and the stop masses are important , become larger as the rg scale increases.for @xmath32 , the one - loop beta - function vanishes and @xmath66 is constant , but @xmath70 becomes larger at the high energy scale due to two - loop effects .",
    "in other words , even if @xmath70 is large at the gut scale , the low - energy value of @xmath70 is small especially for @xmath71  @xcite .    with the enhancement of the gluino mass , the rg effect on",
    "the @xmath42 parameter becomes larger .",
    "this can be easily understood from the rge of the @xmath42 parameter ; at the one - loop level , @xmath72,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we show only the terms depending on @xmath57 gauge coupling constant or the top yukawa coupling constant .",
    "one can see that the @xmath42 parameter is generated by the rg effect using the gluino mass as a source , and the low - energy value of @xmath73 is likely to become larger as @xmath70 increases .",
    "more quantitative discussion about the enhancement of the @xmath42 parameter is also possible . solving rges ,",
    "the @xmath42 parameter at the mass scale of the susy particles , denoted as @xmath74 , can be parametrized as @xmath75 where the numbers in the curly brackets are the coefficients for the cases of the mssm ( i.e. , @xmath76 ) , @xmath32 , and @xmath71 , from the top to the bottom , which are evaluated by using two - loop rges with @xmath77 , and @xmath78 with @xmath79 being the scale where the boundary conditions for the susy breaking parameters are set .",
    "( in our numerical calculations , we take @xmath80 . ) in deriving eq .",
    "( as well as eqs .   and )",
    ", we have taken @xmath81 , and , for simplicity , we have assumed that ( i ) the gaugino masses obey the gut relation , ( ii ) the susy breaking scalar masses are universal at @xmath79 , and ( iii ) all the trilinear scalar coupling constants are proportional to corresponding yukawa coupling constant ( with the proportionality factor @xmath82 ) at @xmath79 .",
    "we can see that the coefficient of the @xmath66 term becomes larger as @xmath18 increases .    similarly",

    "we can see that , in such a case , the trilinear coupling constant @xmath42 is more enhanced than the stop masses , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , which makes the threshold correction to the higgs mass larger ( see eq .  ) .    based on the above discussion , we have seen that the inclusion of the extra vector - like matter pushes up the higgs mass for a fixed value of the gluino mass .",
    "thus , the relevant value of the gluino mass realizing the observed higgs mass becomes lower as the number of extra matter increases . in the next section , we will see that this is really the case , and derived the upper bound on the gluino mass with more detailed analysis of the rg effects .",

    "we calculate the thermal relic density using micromegas 4.1.7 package  @xcite . in the points * i * , * ii * and * v * ( * iii * and * iv * ) , we take @xmath32 ( @xmath71 ) . in the points * ii * , * iii * and * v * , the gut relation among the gaugino masses is relaxed . in * ii * and * iii * ( * v * ) , because of the bino - wino coannihilation ( stau coannihilation ) , the thermal relic abundance of the lightest neutralino becomes constraint from the observed dark mater abundance . in the points * i * and * iv * , the higgsino like neutralino is the lsp , and the thermal relic abundance smaller by about 1/10 compared to the observed dark matter abundance . with non - thermal productions , this higgsino - like neutralino can be candidate for a dark matter.one might worry about the constraint from the direct detection experiments of dark matter .",
    "however , the neutralino - nucleon scattering cross section is suppressed when @xmath64 is large .",
    "we have investigated the upper - bound on the gluino mass for @xmath157gev , with 3 or 4 copies of the vector - like multiples around tev , transforming @xmath12 and @xmath13 representations in @xmath14 gut gauge group .",
    "we have shown that with these vector - like multiplets , the upper - bound on the gluino mass is significantly reduced compared to that of the mssm .",
    "the significant reduction originates from the fact that the radiatively generated trilinear coupling of stops as well as the stop masses is enhanced for the fixed gluino mass at the low - energy scale . in both cases of @xmath32 and @xmath33 ,",
    "the gluino mass is less than 3tev in a wide range of parameter space , and the gluino is likely to be discovered at the lhc run-2 or the high luminosity lhc .",
    "the presence of 3 or 4 copies of the vector - like multiplets at around tev is suggested by the recently observed 750gev diphoton excess at the lhc . with the vector - like extra matters as well as a gauge singlet field @xmath9",
    ", the diphoton excess can be explained by the production and the diphoton decay of @xmath9 .",
    "in such a scenario , the singlet field @xmath9 should couple to the vector - like matters @xmath12 and @xmath13 with yukawa couplings of @xmath158 in the superpotential . in order to make the mass of @xmath9 as well as those of the vector - like matters being close to the tev scale , it is attractive if they have the same origin , i.e. , the vacuum expectation value of @xmath9 , @xmath159 tev .",
    "even if the susy breaking soft mass squared of @xmath9 , denoted as @xmath160 , is positive at a high scale , it can be driven to negative via the rg effect because @xmath9 is expected to have a strong yukawa interaction with the vector - like matters .",
    "with such a negative mass squared parameter , @xmath161 can become non - vanishing",
    ". however , we found that @xmath162 is typically much larger than @xmath163 in the parameter region of our interest .",
    "thus , we need a tuning to obtain the correct size of @xmath161 by introducing supersymmetric mass parameters for @xmath9 : , in order to make a mass of a scalar component of @xmath9 to be 750gev , one generally requires a tuning due to the negative @xmath160 . ]",
    "the required tuning is typically @xmath164 percent level .",
