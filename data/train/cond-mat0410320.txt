    "the study of transport mechanisms at the mesoscale level is of great importance nowadays .",
    "specifically , the so - called ratchet systems have shown to be proper candidates for explaining unidirectional motion to biological systems @xcite , and have important physical applications for nano- and micro - scale technologies @xcite .",
    "many of these models have been developed in the simple picture of point - like particles @xcite ( see the reviews @xcite for details ) .",
    "such scenario has been subsequently generalized to spatially extended systems @xcite , where much attention has been paid to situations where the net motion arises through time - symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "this kind of ratchet phenomenon has been recently observed in long josephson junction ( ljj ) devices @xcite .",
    "another possibility that has been considered in the literature is that of nonlinear klein - gordon system where the on - site potential is ratchet - like @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding , to our knowledge the case of spatial - symmetry breaking by inhomogeneities has not been studied in depth .",
    "one such study has been done by carapella et al . who used an inhomogeneous magnetic field to create an effective inhomogeneous junction profile for fluxons to propagate @xcite .",
    "recently an alternative to the generation of motion for extended systems with a disorder in the chain has been proposed @xcite .",
    "the novelty of the procedure is the design of a ratchet device from a lattice of _ point - like inhomogeneities_. for this system , net motion arises from the interplay between disorder and nonlinearity of the nonlinear systems @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we elaborate on the preliminary results reported in @xcite .",
    "our aim is to carry out an in - depth analysis of the system , including a careful comparison to related point - like ratchets @xcite and an extension of our results , originally obtained for the sine - gordon ( sg ) model , to other nonlinear klein - gordon models such as the @xmath0 equation .",
    "additional motivation for this work arises from research on models of energy propagation along microtubule filaments inside the cells @xcite .",
    "this application is specially interesting in view of the possible connection with the dynamics of transport in molecular motors in biological systems , with features similar to those of solitons as extended objects . in this context",
    ", the present work sheds light on the role played by the length scale competition between the point - like inhomogeneities ( disorder ) and the size of kinks in the transport dynamics . for this purpose",
    ", we use the framework of collective coordinates ( cc ) in order to gain insight in the cause of the motion and the degrees of freedom that take part in it .",
    "emphasis will be given to the kink width oscillations and their role in the transport properties : indeed , in general , the width of the nonlinear topological excitations is crucial for the movement of these coherent excitations .",
    "the coupling between the translational and kink width degrees is such that motion takes place @xcite .",
    "in particular , in the present work we will see that the oscillation range of the kink width is determined by the interplay with the inhomogeneities .",
    "an additional , relevant issue is the analysis of the motion dynamics under thermal fluctuations . in ratchets , the noise is an important source of energy and , for some biological systems , it is regarded as the main cause of transport . here",
    "we will consider the robustness of our rocking ratchet system under thermal fluctuations . in this case ,",
    "activation of unidirectional motion was observed for a certain range of frequencies in the simulations as well as in the cc . in order to achieve the above mentioned goals ,",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we formulate the basis for the ratchet device and explain the origin and physical reasons of the rectification process .",
    "a discussion in the cc framework is devoted to the length scale competition between the inhomogeneities and the kink width , and its influence on the motion dynamics . in the same context",
    ", we establish an analogy with a simple model used for describing unidirectional motion in molecular motors @xcite , pointing out the relevant role of the kink width for the ratchet dynamics and its application in biological systems .",
    "subsequently , an analysis of the efficiency in terms of the quantization of the transport is done for the relevant parameters of our ratchet system , including the interference effects among the inhomogeneities .",
    "an example is given for the @xmath0 model , not only for its known rich internal dynamics reinforced by the presence of an internal mode , but also for its potential application to macromolecules ( e.g. , in transfer of energy in microtubules @xcite ) .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "iii , we analyze the kink dynamics subject to noise .",
    "in particular , a new phenomenon of activation of motion induced by noise is described . in order to explain this new behavior ,",
    "different collective coordinate approaches are implemented and thoroughly discussed .",
    "finally , in the last section we summarize the main contributions of our work and make a discussion about the perspectives on this line .",
    "we include appendixes where we detail the cc approaches for one and two collective variables , extending the _ generalized traveling wave ansatz _ ( gtwa ) to the case where inhomogeneities and noise act together with damping and ac forces .",
    "kink dynamics in the presence of inhomogeneities can exhibit different and interesting behaviors , depending on the interplay between those inhomogeneities and the nonlinearity @xcite among other factors .",
    "the generation of net motion using a lattice of point - like inhomogeneities is a good example of such non - trivial phenomenon @xcite .",
    "although in that previous work the problem was discussed for the sg model , it can be generalized in principle for any nonlinear klein gordon system .",
    "therefore , aiming at that general viewpoint , for our analysis we formulate the model in a general way as follows : @xmath1=a\\sin(\\omega t+\\delta_{0 } ) ,   \\label{1}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the potential for the nonlinear klein - gordon equations and @xmath3 is an external ac force whose parameters @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 represent the amplitude , frequency and phase of the periodic force , respectively . in particular , we will focus on the @xmath0 and sg models as specific examples ; the corresponding nonlinear potentials are @xmath7 and @xmath8 $ ] respectively .    for our potential to exhibit ratchet - like phenomenon",
    ", we choose @xmath9 to be given by a periodically repeated unit cell , formed by an asymmetric array of delta functions ( inhomogeneities ) .",
    "the unit cell configuration , of length @xmath10 , is defined by three inhomogeneities , the first one located at the beginning of the cell , the second at distance @xmath11 from the first , and the third at distance @xmath12 from the second .",

    "the choice of three inhomogeneities is inspired by biological polymers like dna where the existence of three bases per codon seems to be the ideal configuration for the occurrence of net transport @xcite . in principle",
    "it is possible to obtain unidirectional motion by using an array whose configuration presents more than three inhomogeneities per unit cell if the distances between the delta functions are in the same length scale as the kink width ( otherwise , different behaviors could arise like obtained e.g. in @xcite ) .",

    "this is an intrinsic feature of these nonlinear excitations , and correspondingly the competition between their width and the distances among the inhomogeneities is crucial for the kink motion .",
    "the interference effects among the inhomogeneities @xcite create an effective potential for the motion of the kink center , the location of the inhomogeneities determining the direction of motion .",
    "for the particular configuration of three inhomogeneities per unit cell , directional motion takes place only under the condition @xmath39 . in the upper panel of fig .",

    "( [ 1 ] ) for the sg case with different values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 are depicted .",
    "such a picture shows that our ratchet device is an authentic rectifier .",
    "in addition , as in standard ratchet systems , the directional motion of the kink center takes place only for certain values of the amplitude of the ac force ( see lower panel of fig .  [ ratchet0 ] ) , a behavior that is dependent on the ac force frequency . a more detailed picture of the dynamics of the mean velocity for the sg kink center as a function of the ac force amplitude for different frequencies can be found in @xcite .",
    "we have restricted ourselves to the overdamped case by taking @xmath40 , where the inertial effects are small , reducing the generation and propagation of phonons , and for which the kink center moves on a tilted effective potential due to the external ac force .",
    "this regime prevents also the dependence on the initial conditions for the dynamics @xcite . for the integration of eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) we have used a strauss - vzquez numerical scheme @xcite with free boundary conditions and spatial and temporal steps @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "we have checked our results with different spatial steps @xmath43 and @xmath44 . the simulations were done for the spatial interval @xmath45 $ ] with inhomogeneities arranged periodically according to our period in @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "we have used the numerical representation for delta functions given by @xmath47 such representation is not unique but is one of the simplest forms for the numerical implementation @xcite .      in order to understand the dynamics of the kink center different cc approaches",
    "have been implemented @xcite . in this previous work",
    ", it was shown that a 1-cc approach is not enough for the correct quantitative description of the results of the simulations even considering possible relativistic effects for high values of ac the force .",
    "however , this approach allows us to understand the underlying physics of this ratchet system in the simplest way . on the other hand , satisfactory agreement with the simulations",
    "was found by an improved , 2-cc approach , which takes into account the kink width dynamics @xcite . at this point",
    "we will proceed directly with the discussion of the improved theory .",

    "therefore , changes in the kink width directly affect the translational motion .",
    "it is possible to observe , for instance , that decreasing the kink width decreases the effective ac force , making necessary to increase the amplitude of the ac force in order to compensate for such effect .",

    "[ ancho ] . as we can see , the agreement with the cc approach is excellent , confirming the validity of our predictions .",
    "it is particularly interesting the existence of loops , which arises as a consequence of the kink center motion back and forth into the wells of the effective potential ( see fig .  [ rat3pot ] ) , i.e. , describing half an oscillation before overcoming the barrier .",
    "interestingly , another feature that stands out clearly is that the oscillations are around a value different from @xmath56 , the width of the unperturbed kink .",
    "figure [ ancho ] shows that they take place around @xmath62 and , furthermore , that @xmath63 is not even included in the range of oscillations .",
    "this phenomenon is the result of the balance between two opposite forces . on the one hand",
    ", the inclusion of inhomogeneities increases the potential energy of the system .",
    "this fact is reflected in the effective potential energy landscape fig .  [ rat3pot ] .",
    "such picture shows that when the kink width decreases , the potential energy decreases as well . taking two points with the same value for @xmath51 but with different kink widths @xmath52 , for example @xmath64 and @xmath65 in fig.[rat3pot]b )",
    ", we see this difference in potential energy , i.e. , @xmath66 where @xmath67 . therefore , as the tendency of the system is to go to the minimum of the potential energy , the kink width would decrease . on the other hand , the kink internal potential energy , eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) , has a minimum in @xmath63 , and hence the energy increases when the kink width decreases ( see fig .",
    "( [ curveuint ] ) for @xmath68 ) ; notice that the first term of this equation accounts for a repulsive interaction and the second is given by an attractive one .",
    "as a result of this balance , a new minimum will appear for the oscillations of the kink width .",
    "it is important to note that the difference @xmath69 of the internal potential energy for the kink width @xmath70 with respect to the value @xmath56 ( inset of fig",
    ".  [ curveuint ] ) is of the same order as the energy difference @xmath71 between the points mentioned before for the effective potential introduced by the inhomogeneities , in agreement with this discussion .",
    "a problem closely related to our 2-cc approach , given by a point particle ratchet with two degrees of freedom , has been studied in @xcite .",
    "this model was designed for describing molecular motor dynamics consisting of two particles joined by a spring moving in a ratchet potential .",
    "the corresponding equations of motion are given by @xmath72 where @xmath73 , @xmath74 represent the coordinates of the particles , @xmath75 is a sawtooth potential and @xmath76 is the internal potential energy . here @xmath77 with @xmath78 are gaussian white noises . ignoring the noise terms and their influence on the net motion",
    ", we see that the change of variables @xmath79 and @xmath80 casts the system in a similar shape as eqs .",
    "( [ 4]-[5 ] ) in the overdamped case , for which in good approximation the inertial terms could be neglected .",
    "in such a new context the variables @xmath51 , @xmath52 can be interpreted as the mass center and elongation ( distance between the particles ) respectively , and obviously they resemble to the variables mass center and width of the kink in our system .",
    "notice that in both models we have an asymmetric potential . in our case",
    "it is given by eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) , which is asymmetric at the cc level if the already mentioned conditions for the distances between the inhomogeneities are satisfied . in both systems",
    ", there are internal potential energies that characterize their elastic properties . in the model in @xcite",
    ", the internal potential is expressed through a harmonic function ( in the original variables ) : @xmath81 ^ 2,\\ ] ] which in our collective coordinates can be written as @xmath82 ^ 2.\\ ] ] where @xmath83 is the elasticity constant .",
    "the links between the two models can be made more explicit by using a value for @xmath84 close to the minimum around which the kink width oscillates in our simulations ( cf .",
    "the discussion in the preceding subsection ) .",
    "+ it is important to point out that we have defined @xmath52 as a kink width variable as given in the expression ( [ b7 ] ) of the appendix .",
    "however , what the quantity @xmath52 actually means is the distance at which the kink shape approaches its asymptotic values , measured from the center .",
    "this means that @xmath52 in our notation is half the `` real kink width '' .",
    "consequently the ratio ( real kink width)/(period of the effective potential ) becomes @xmath85 for which a very interesting dynamics for point particles dynamics has been reported in related 2-particle model @xcite .",
    "+ this comparison between our model and that in @xcite allows to point out their main differences as well .",
    "it is particularly important that in our framework , the internal energy can describe satisfactorily the repulsive interaction between real molecules where a van - der - waals like - force prevents their overlap .",
    "this is very close to what occurs in molecular motors : if we take again the motion of kinesin as an example , this molecule has two dimer heads that act as ` feet ' , allowing the molecule to ` walk ' along a microtubule @xcite .",
    "the repulsion would then appear when the two dimer heads are too close .",
    "such a repulsive interaction can not be naturally accounted for within the model of two particles . for solving this problem the authors of @xcite resort to fix arbitrary values for @xmath84 which in our case is not necessary .",
    "note , however , that in spite of the technical differences between both models , phenomenologically they are very similar : both of them try to understand how the motion of molecular motors , which proceeds in steps accompanied by deformations ( in the case of kinesin , when one step advances in front of the other ) can arise .",
    "the common conclusion is that a point particle ratchet would not be a good model because the second degree of freedom is needed to capture the whole mechanism of the motion .",
    "the advantage in our approach is that this second degree of freedom arises on its own , without a priori constructions , as an emergent property of the nonlinear excitation .",
    "recent studies @xcite show similar phenomena for the two degrees of freedom point particle ratchet of @xcite when the ratchet is of flashing type .",
    "the close relationship of the model of @xcite to ours suggests that nonlinear klein - gordon models can also exhibit rectification working as flashing ratchets , an issue we will address in future work",
    ".      it should be clear , from the results discussed so far , that in order to obtain a ratchet device for extended nonlinear systems with topological nonlinear excitations , the configuration of the inhomogeneities should be designed in such a way that the distance between the inhomogeneities is of the order of the kink width . however , this picture is somewhat too simple , and as we will see below , another important factor to take into account is the existence of interference effects . naively , one may try to design a similar ratchet system for the @xmath0 equation . considering only the kink width factor , it would seem that enlarging the sg array by a factor of @xmath86 ( the ratio between the kink widths in both models ) similar phenomena would be observed .    ) -([14 ] ) , for two different arrays with @xmath36 .",

    "furthermore , a very low frequency would be required to obtain windows of motion . in the case of the dependence on the inhomogeneities height ,",
    "the starting point of the stair - steps structure shows a shift towards greater amplitude of the ac force when increases the height , which is natural in order to overcome the barrier .",
    "nevertheless , a higher speed is found , arising from a higher @xmath106 and observable also as a broadening in the windows of motion .",
    "this far , we have analyzed the ratchet - like behavior of our system in the deterministic case .",
    "however , it is clear that for our model to be more realistic , for instance , in the context of ljj , the effect of the temperature has to be taken into account .",
    "the behavior of ratchet systems for nonzero temperature has been extensively studied both for point particles @xcite and for nonlinear extended systems @xcite . as for the problem we are considering here",
    ", the fact that there has not been much effort on soliton ratchet - like phenomena induced by spatial inhomogeneities carries over to the stochastic effects .",
    "therefore , it is important that we address this issue here . for the present work",
    ", we will focus on the robustness of our rocking ratchet under thermal fluctuations .",

    "hereafter , we have set the array parameters to be @xmath25 , @xmath124 , @xmath27 , @xmath38 and @xmath36 for our study .",
    "the mean velocity was calculated using the expression in @xcite , namely @xmath125 where the average is to be understood over many realizations of the noise . from this figure",
    "we see that the steps of the deterministic case are now smoothed , a typical feature for the dynamics under noise .",
    "it is important to realize that this smoothing affects the regions between the windows , which become minima of the mean velocity modulus @xmath126 instead of gaps with null mean velocity ( see fig.[ratchet3]a ) .",
    "this phenomenon is directly related to the strength of the noise , i.e , when the noise increases , the absolute value for the mean velocity decreases but simultaneously the connection between the windows becomes more evident and the windows of motion become less pronounced .    as in most other ratchet systems , in our model",
    "the stochastic fluctuations due to temperature assist the jumps of the kink center from one well to the next one , allowing in some cases jumps in the opposite direction of the rectification ( see the inset graphic in fig .",
    "[ ratchet3]b ) which is not possible in the absence of noise .",
    "accordingly , the thermal fluctuations affect the mechanism of rectification whereas , on the other hand , they yield the dynamics of the pure oscillating states of the kink center unstable ( i.e. , destabilizing the regions with locked directional motion for zero temperature ) .",
    "the joint action of both effects leads to the smoothing of the windows and the connection of the deterministic gaps .",

    "for this reason the rectification of motion takes place only for not so large values of the noise intensity ( see discussion in @xcite ) .    a remarkable feature we have observed in the simulations",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ ratchet3]b for frequency @xmath60 , where new windows ( absent in the deterministic case ) appear .",
    "this scenario is very similar to the one reported in @xcite where a similar surprising and intriguing phenomenon was noted .",
    "there , the authors discussed that these new windows arose due to jumps of the fluxons between stable and unstable pinned fixed points of the deterministic dynamics .",
    "considering the interest for this stochastic phenomenon , we carried out a careful analysis of the corresponding zone . to summarize this work , in fig .",
    "[ activa ] we plot the mean velocity as a function of the noise intensity for different values of the frequency , showing the existence of an effective value for the intensity of the noise for which a maximum absolute value of the mean velocity is obtained .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "[ activa ] makes it clear that , as expected and suggested in @xcite , the mechanism of activation occurs through jumps between multistable states ( states of the kink center which in absence of noise are purely oscillating ) .",
    "therefore , a higher velocity is obtained when the residence time in these multistates is reduced or , in other words , when the intervals between consecutive jumps decrease . once again , this process of activation becomes more effective when the noise intensity increases , but above a certain value of the noise intensity the kink center starts to jump in the direction opposite to that of the rectification , leading to a global loss in efficiency .",
    "this explains the existence of an effective value for the noise intensity for which the velocity reaches a maximum value .",
    "another interesting characteristic observed in fig .",
    "[ activa ] is the dependence of the maximum mean velocity on the frequency .",
    "specifically , for a frequency value slightly larger than @xmath60 , the maximum velocity decreases , the peak moving towards greater values of the noise and the corresponding window of motion moving towards greater values of the ac force . accordingly , for a relatively large value of the frequency , above @xmath129 , the window of motion induced by noise disappears . on the other hand , for frequencies slightly smaller than @xmath60 , a new window in absence of noise is obtained . with all these results",
    ", it is clearly established that the unidirectional motion induced by noise occurs only for a narrow window of frequency values .",
    "we will show in the next subsection that this phenomenon seems to be a general feature , since at the cc level the system behaves very much like the dynamics of point particles .      in order to understand the behavior observed in the previous section we resort again to the cc approach . as a first step ,",
    "we take only into account one degree of freedom .",
    "although , as discussed above , this framework is inaccurate for describing quantitatively the kink motion on a lattice of inhomogeneities , it does help understand qualitatively most of the features observed in the simulations , without unnecessary analytical complications .",
    "after some algebra ( see appendix a for details ) , with @xmath40 , we find the following expression for the kink center coordinate with noise : @xmath132 with @xmath133 , @xmath134 . for the sake of simplicity we have taken the nonrelativistic approach @xmath135 , for which the noise turns out to be simply additive .",

    "a new window is predicted , whose location is also in very good agreement with its corresponding window in the simulations .",
    "these results confirm the importance of considering the kink width dynamics in the framework of the collective coordinates in order to achieve correct quantitative results as compared to the simulations .",
    "we have studied the dynamics of solitons in a lattice of point - like inhomogeneities in two different nonlinear systems , the sg and the @xmath0 models , as good representatives of an entire class of nonlinear models .",
    "we have designed a periodic lattice made of an asymmetric unit cell , where , depending on the lattice parameters , ratchet - like motion of solitons ( rectification ) is observed .",
    "this is one of the few examples proposed so far for soliton ratchets based on spatial inhomogeneity .",
    "building on a preliminary work reported in @xcite , we have analyzed in full detail all the characteristics and features of interest of our model . in order to understand the observed phenomenology , we have developed two cc approaches : one that takes into account only the motion of the kink center , and another one that includes the kink width as a second degree of freedom .",
    "we have seen that whereas both techniques give good qualitative results and allow for a general understanding the phenomenon , only when the kink width enters in the cc description the results are quantitatively correct .",
    "interestingly , the cc approach allows to show that rectification takes place only when the unit cell gives rise to an effective potential of the same length scale as the kink width .",
    "this fact , along with the relevant role played by the width dynamical behavior , makes us conclude that one essential ingredient for observing ratchet - like behavior in this system is the existence of length scale competition @xcite .    as a necessary complement of the deterministic study ,",
    "we have considered the influence of thermal noise on the behavior of our model systems . as in the deterministic case , the cc technique yields very good results .",
    "of particular relevance is the appearance , at the 2-cc level , of multiplicative noise in the cc equations , coupled to the kink width .",
    "this is yet another hint to the crucial role played by this degree of freedom in the dynamics of the system .",
    "another important feature is the motion activation induced by noise , that was observed in the simulations and later corroborated in the cc framework .    in a wider context",
    ", we believe that the cc approach presented here , and the conclusions about the role of the kink width , are of a much more general applicability .",
    "this is the case , for instance , with the anomalous resonances observed in nonlinear klein - gordon models @xcite , which can only be explained by considering the width degree of freedom . specifically within the context of rectification",
    ", we have previously shown that the existence of ratchet behavior induced by pure asymmetric temporal driving in a homogeneous system , recently demonstrated in experiments in ljj @xcite , is due to the coupling between the translation and the width oscillations @xcite .",
    "based on all these experiences , we believe that the implementation of the 2-cc approach can be very useful in the case of spatially correlated noise @xcite , where the 1-cc approach can not explain the length scale competition between the correlation length and the size of the kink , first suggested in @xcite",
    ". the new formulation would be also necessary in using the cc framework for describing the transport of proteins assisted by a thermal bath provoked by atp molecules hydrolization , where the width is an important quantity to take into account .",
    "on the other hand , it is becoming more and more evident the crucial contribution of internal degrees of freedom in the functioning of molecular motors @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "our results suggests that models including in a natural way this degree of freedom , like in our case , can be the proper descriptions of those phenomena .",
    "size dependent rectification has been also reported in colloids @xcite and rectification through clustering has been observed in granular gases @xcite , which further reinforce our conclusion that the deformation or internal degrees of freedom must be an ingredient of good theoretical description of ratchet phenomena beyond the point particle scenario .",
    "finally , we want to stress that our design of a soliton system with ratchet behavior is a very simple one , that can be implemented in actual experiments and devices such as ljj , for instance .",
    "another field where the current state - of - the - art allows to apply this result is that of engineered molecular motors , demonstrated , e.g. , in @xcite . in this case",
    ", our proposal may apply to the design of biomolecular devices with medical applications . generally speaking",
    ", this type of approach to rectification can be of interest for applications in which it is needed to have a tunable rectifier tailored for a specific regime .",
    "of course , experimental verification of our predictions is needed to ascertain the accuracy of our results .",
    "we hope that this work stimulates experiments in this direction .",
    "indeed the research reported here , opens new perspectives in the design of ratchet devices for more complicated extended nonlinear systems , such as general coupled chains @xcite .",
