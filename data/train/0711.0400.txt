    "the study of supergravity theories , and their symmetries , have played a very important rle in uncovering the underlying structures of string theory . especially significant",
    "are the u - duality symmetries of the string , which have their origin in the classical global symmetries exhibited by eleven - dimensional supergravity and type iia and iib supergravities after toroidal dimensional reduction .",
    "for example , if one reduces eleven - dimensional supergravity on an @xmath4-torus , for @xmath5 , the resulting @xmath6-dimensional theory exhibits a global @xmath7 symmetry @xcite . in the cases",
    "@xmath8 this symmetry arises in quite a subtle way , involving an interplay between the original eleven - dimensional metric and the 3-form potential .    in view of the large @xmath9 symmetry that one finds after reduction to three dimensions ,",
    "it is natural to push further and investigate the symmetries after further reduction to two dimensions , and even beyond .",
    "it turns out that the analysis of the global symmetry for a reduction to two dimensions is considerably more complicated than the higher - dimensional ones .",
    "there are two striking new features that lead to this complexity .",
    "the first is that , unlike a reduction to @xmath10 dimensions , one can no longer use a reduction scheme in which the metric is reduced from an einstein - frame metric in the higher dimension to an einstein - frame metric in the lower dimension .",
    "( in the einstein conformal frame , the lagrangian for gravity itself takes the form @xmath11 , with no scalar conformal factor . ) the inability to reach the einstein conformal frame in two dimensions is intimately connected to the fact that @xmath12 is a conformal invariant in two dimensions .",
    "it has the consequence that the metric in two dimensions is not invariant under the global symmetries .",
    "the second striking new feature is that an axionic scalar field ( a scalar appearing everywhere covered by a derivative ) can be dualised to give another axionic scalar field in the special case of two dimensions .",
    "this has the remarkable consequence that the global symmetry group actually becomes infinite in dimension .",
    "this was seen long ago by geroch , in the context of four - dimensional gravity reduced to two .",
    "there are degrees of freedom in two dimensions that are described by the sigma model @xmath3 , and under dualisation this yields another @xmath3 sigma model .",
    "geroch showed that the two associated global @xmath13 symmetries do not commute , and that if one takes repeated commutators of the two sets of transformations , an infinite - dimensional algebra results @xcite .",
    "the precise nature of this symmetry , now known as the _ geroch group _ , was not uncovered in @xcite .",
    "the feature of having an infinite - dimensional symmetry in two dimensions is not restricted to situations where gravity is involved , and in fact the same essential mechanism operates in a similar fashion if one considers a sigma model in a flat two - dimensional spacetime .",
    "thus , a natural preliminary to investigating the symmetries of two - dimensional reductions in supergravity is to study the symmetry of a flat two - dimensional sigma model @xmath14 .",
    "considerable simplifications arise if one restricts attention to symmetric - space sigma models , and since these in any case always arise in supergravity dimensional reductions , the specialisation to this class of models is a very natural one .",
    "we shall use the acronym ssm to denote a symmetric - space sigma model .",
    "there is quite a considerable literature on the subject of the infinite dimensional symmetries of two - dimensional symmetric - space sigma models , both in the flat and the curved spacetime cases ( see , for example , @xcite , some of which considers also principal chiral models ) .",
    "a very clear and explicit presentation of the global symmetry algebras of two - dimensional ssms has been provided by schwarz , whose papers formulate the problem in a very transparent way .",
    "he first considers the problem of two - dimensional theories in flat spacetime in @xcite , and then generalises to the case of a curved two - dimensional spacetime in @xcite .",
    "he also gives an extended history of the earlier literature , and rather than attempting to repeat that here , we refer the reader to his papers for further details .    our work in the present paper is concerned entirely with the case of symmetric - space sigma models in flat two - dimensional spacetime , and we follow very closely the approach taken by schwarz in @xcite .",
    "the results in @xcite differ somewhat from those in much of the literature , where the infinite - dimensional global symmetry algebra of the ssm @xmath14 is found to be @xmath2 , the affine kac - moody extension of the underlying algebra @xmath0 of the `` manifest '' global symmetry group @xmath15 .",
    "the generators of @xmath2 may be represented by @xmath16 , satisfying = f^ij_k j^k_m+n , where @xmath17 are the structure constants for the lie algebra @xmath0 , whose generators @xmath18 satisfy @xmath19=f^{ij}{}_k\\ , t^k$ ] .    by contrast , schwarz obtained a certain subalgebra @xmath20 of @xmath2 as the global symmetry algebra , essentially generated by @xmath21 , where the @xmath22 sign is chosen if @xmath23 lies in the denominator algebra @xmath24 , and the @xmath25 sign if @xmath23 lies in the coset @xmath26 .",
    "we find that by extending the techniques developed by schwarz , we can construct explicit global symmetries for the entire @xmath1 kac - moody algebra , expressed purely in terms of local field transformations .",
    "as far as we are aware , it is only through the use of the construction that schwarz developed that it has become possible to obtain explicit local transformations for the entire kac - moody algebra .",
    "we find also that the subalgebra obtained by schwarz can be viewed as a gauge - fixed version of this full kac - moody symmetry .    in order to understand this",
    ", we recall that the possibility of dualising axions to give new axions in two dimensions means that the original theory can be reformulated in terms of new fields that are non - locally related to the original ones ( since the process of dualisation requires differentiation and hodge dualisation , followed by integration , to obtain the new variables ) . a convenient way to handle this is to enlarge the system by introducing auxiliary fields , so that the manifest global symmetries of the original and the dualised sigma models can be exhibited simultaneously , in purely local terms . in fact to do this",
    ", one has to introduce an infinite number of auxiliary fields .",
    "the full set of kac - moody symmetries , generated by @xmath16 with @xmath27 , acts on the complete set of original plus auxiliary fields .",
    "however , the `` negative half '' of the kac - moody algebra @xmath1 , generated by @xmath16 with @xmath28 , acts exclusively on the auxiliary fields , whilst leaving the original sigma - model fields inert .",
    "in fact these symmetries are essentially constant shift transformations of the auxiliary fields , reflecting the arbitrariness of the choice of constants of integration that arose when the non - local dualisation was recast into a local form in terms of the auxiliary fields .",
    "the subalgebra @xmath20 of symmetries found by schwarz can be viewed as a gauge fixing in which the values of the original and the auxiliary fields are all set to prescribed values at some chosen point in the two - dimensional spacetime .",
    "effectively , the level-0 transformations @xmath29 that lie in @xmath30 are used up in gauge fixing the original fields to their prescribed values , and the entirety of the @xmath16 transformations with @xmath28 are used up in doing the same for the auxiliary fields .    the formulation in which the auxiliary fields are added has been developed considerably by nicolai , and julia @xcite .",
    "however , the work of schwarz provided a procedure for obtaining explicit expressions for the transformations associated with the `` upper half '' of the kac - moody algebra .",
    "we are able to draw the two approaches together and provide a fully explicit and local description of the entire kac - moody algebra of symmetries .    in order to illustrate these ideas in detail ,",
    "it is useful to examine an example . for this purpose",
    "we choose the simplest non - trivial symmetric - space sigma model , @xmath3 .",
    "we show how one needs to introduce an infinity of auxiliary fields in order to describe simultaneously the original @xmath13 symmetry and the @xmath13 symmetry of the dualised version ( we denote this by @xmath31 ) .",
    "we also show how each generator of each copy of @xmath13 can be precisely matched with a corresponding generator in the kac - moody algebra , and this allows us to show explicitly that the geroch algebra generated by taking multiple commutators of @xmath13 and @xmath31 transformations is exactly the same as the full kac - moody algebra @xmath32 .",
    "we also examine a further symmetry of two - dimensional symmetric - space sigma models @xmath14 , again basing our analysis on the work of schwarz @xcite .",
    "this is again an infinite - dimensional symmetry , but this time a singlet under the original @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "it turns out to be related to the centreless virasoro algebra .",
    "we shall begin by considering an arbitrary symmetric - space sigma model ( ssm ) in a flat two - dimensional spacetime background , with coset given by @xmath33 , where @xmath15 is a lie group with subgroup @xmath34 .",
    "the commutation relations for the corresponding generators of the algebra take the form = , = , [ , ] = .[coset ] the condition that @xmath35 is a symmetric space is reflected in the absence of @xmath30 generators on the right - hand side of the last commutation relation .",
    "the symmetric - space algebra implies that there is an involution @xmath36 under which ^= , ^=- .",
    "[ invol1 ] in many cases , such as when @xmath37 , the involution map is given by hermitean conjugation , ^=,^ = -,[invol2 ] and later , we shall typically write formulae under this assumption . in some cases , such as @xmath38 , @xmath39 , the involution @xmath36 is more involved .",
    "let @xmath40 be a coset representative in @xmath35 .",
    "we may then define m=^ , a= m^-1 dm.[madef ] under transformations hg,[gtrans ] where @xmath41 is a global element in the group @xmath15 and @xmath42 is a local element in the denominator subgroup @xmath34 , we have shall have mg^m g , ag^-1 a g,[mtrans ] since it follows from @xmath43 that @xmath44 .",
    "the cartan - maurer equation @xmath45 implies that the field strength for @xmath46 vanishes : fda + aa=0.[cartmau ] the lagrangian for the coset model may be written as @xmath47 ( or , using indices , @xmath48 ) and hence the equation of motion is d*a=0.[eom ] the lagrangian is clearly invariant under the global @xmath15 transformations , and the equations ( [ cartmau ] ) and ( [ eom ] ) transform covariantly under @xmath15 .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the equations ( [ cartmau ] ) and ( [ eom ] ) can both be derived from the integrability condition for the _ lax pair _ of linear equations ( _ + + a_+ ) x=0 , ( _ - + a_- ) x=0,[lax1 ] to admit a solution @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is an arbitrary constant _",
    "spectral parameter_. these equations are written in light - cone coordinates on the two - dimensional flat spacetime , in which the metric is @xmath51 .",
    "we prefer to use the language of differential forms , for which @xmath52 .",
    "on 1-forms we have @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the hodge dual operator , and = dx^,=a_+ dx^+ - a_- dx^- .",
    "it is useful also to record the following properties for 1-forms @xmath55 and @xmath56 : v= * vu,= - uv,[uvrels ] and for lie - algebra valued 1-forms @xmath46 and @xmath57 : b = - a , = - aa.[abrels ] in terms of differential forms , the lax pair ( [ lax1 ] ) becomes simply the single equation t ( d+a ) x= * dx.[lax2 ] we shall call this the",
    "_ lax equation_. by taking the appropriate linear combination of this and its dual , we obtain dx x^-1 = * a + a.[lax3 ] thus the integrability condition for the existence of a solution @xmath49 to the lax equation , which follows from the cartan - maurer equation @xmath58 , gives d*a + t ( da + aa)=0 . since this must hold for all @xmath50 we indeed derive ( [ cartmau ] ) and ( [ eom ] ) .",
    "note that ( [ lax3 ] ) is an equivalent formulation of the lax equation ; an appropriate linear combination of ( [ lax3 ] ) and its dual gives back ( [ lax2 ] ) .",
    "thus we may use the term `` lax equation '' interchangeably for ( [ lax2 ] ) and ( [ lax3 ] ) .",
    "we have already noted that the global @xmath15 transformations ( [ mtrans ] ) are a symmetry of the zero - curvature condition ( [ cartmau ] ) and the equations of motion ( [ eom ] ) of the two - dimensional coset model .",
    "in fact , these symmetries are merely the tip of an infinite - dimensional `` iceberg '' of global symmetries .",
    "these extended symmetries are a special feature that arises because the coset model lives in a two - dimensional world volume , and they may be understood in a variety of ways .",
    "an intuitive understanding , which we shall turn into a concrete discussion in section [ sl2rsec ] for the example of the coset @xmath3 , is that the axionic scalars can be dualised into new , non - locally related sets of axions in two dimensions , and that the manifest global symmetries in the different duality pictures do not commute , but instead their commutators close only on an infinite - dimensional extension of the finite - dimensional symmetries that are manifest in each individual duality choice .    in the present section",
    ", we shall begin by following a construction given in @xcite , which shows how the formalism of the lax equation may be used to derive the infinite - dimensional algebra .",
    "our description will be formulated in the language of differential forms rather than light - cone coordinates .",
    "the details of our calculation differ somewhat from those in @xcite , and our conclusions differ also . specifically , we find that the full symmetry of the symmetric - space sigma model is precisely the affine kac - moody extension @xmath2 of the manifest @xmath0 global symmetry , and not merely the subalgebra of @xmath2 that was found in @xcite .",
    "( we shall comment further about this later in this subsection , and in appendix [ appa ] . )    at the infinitesimal level , the transformation ( [ gtrans ] ) becomes = + h , where @xmath59 is an infinitesimal global element of the lie algebra @xmath0 and @xmath60 is a local element of @xmath24 . in order to exhibit the infinite - dimensional extension of this symmetry algebra",
    ", one may consider more general transformations of the form @xcite = + h , = x(t ) x(t)^-1.[deltag ] the meaning of this equation is as follows .",
    "as before , @xmath40 is a coset representative for @xmath14 , and thus it depends on the scalar fields parameterising the coset , which themselves depend on the two spacetime coordinates @xmath61 , but it does not depend on the spectral parameter @xmath50 .",
    "the function @xmath62 is the solution of the lax equation ( [ lax2 ] ) and thus it depends on the spacetime coordinates @xmath61 ( we are now suppressing the explicit indication of this dependence ) and on the spectral parameter @xmath50 .",
    "the quantity @xmath60 , in the denominator algebra @xmath24 , is a function of the spacetime fields and it may now depend upon @xmath50 . on the left - hand side of ( [ deltag ] )",
    "there is @xmath50-dependence only in the variational symbol @xmath63 itself , and it is to be interpreted as = ( , t ) = _ n0 t^n _ ( ) .[deltan ] thus by equating powers of @xmath50 on the two sides of ( [ deltag ] ) we obtain a hierarchy of transformations @xmath64 that act upon the scalar fields in the coset representative @xmath40 .",
    "the lowest set of transformations , for @xmath65 , just correspond to the original infinitesimal @xmath15 transformations that were manifest in the coset model from the outset .",
    "by contrast the transformations @xmath64 with @xmath66 , which all involve @xmath50-dependent terms in @xmath62 , are non - local expressions in terms of the original fields of the scalar coset .    to check that ( [ deltag ] ) does indeed give symmetries of the theory",
    ", one must check that the corresponding variation of the equation of motion ( [ eom ] ) vanishes .",
    "first , one sees from ) . in a case where the more general @xmath36 involution operator is required ,",
    "all @xmath67 symbols in what follows should be replaced by @xmath36 . ]",
    "@xmath68 and @xmath69 that ( [ deltag ] ) implies m = m+ ^m , a= d+ d(m^-1 ^m),[delma ] where the @xmath15-covariant exterior derivative is defined on any @xmath0-valued function @xmath70 by df = df + [ a , f ] .",
    "it can also be seen from the definition of @xmath71 in ( [ deltag ] ) , after making use of the lax equation ( [ lax2 ] ) , that d= 1 t * d , d(m^-1 ^m)= t * d(m^-1 ^m ) .",
    "thus we conclude that under ( [ deltag ] ) , a = * d ( 1 t + t m^-1 ^m ) , which indeed verifies that @xmath72 .    in order to read off the symmetry algebra one needs to calculate commutators of the form @xmath73 $ ] . since , as noted above , the variations @xmath64 involve @xmath62 , which itself depends non - locally on the fields of the scalar coset , one first needs to calculate the variations of @xmath62 with respect to the hierarchy of transformations @xmath64 .",
    "this was obtained in @xcite , and with a small but important modification that we shall discuss later , it is given by _ 1 x_2 = ( _ 1 x_2 - x_2 _ 1 ) + m^-1 _",
    "1^m x_2.[del1x2 ] here @xmath74 ( with no parentheses around the 1 ) denotes @xmath75 , whilst @xmath76 denotes @xmath62 for a different and independent choice of spectral parameter @xmath77 . by equating the coefficients of @xmath78 on both sides of ( [ del1x2 ] ) , one can read off the variation under @xmath79 of the @xmath80 term in the series expansion of @xmath81 .    in order to derive ( [ del1x2 ] ) , we follow the method used in @xcite , which amounts to varying the lax equation ( [ lax2 ] ) under ( [ deltag ] ) , with @xmath82 given in ( [ delma ] ) and @xmath83 given by ( [ del1x2 ] ) , and verifying that the varied equation is also satisfied .",
    "thus , one must substitute ( [ del1x2 ] ) into ( _ 1 x_2 ) + t_2(_1 a ) x_2=0 , or in other words , after using ( [ delma ] ) , into ( _ 1 x_2 ) + t_2 [ d_1 + d(m^-1_1^m ) ] x_2=0.[varlax ] after some algebra , again involving the use of the lax equation , the desired result follows .    using ( [ del1x2 ] )",
    "one can calculate the commutator of transformations on @xmath84 , finding ( in a similar manner to @xcite ) that m= m , [ comm ] where @xmath85 $ ] .",
    "it is also straightforward to show , after some lengthy algebra , that x_3= x_3 , [ comx ] if the transformations @xmath63 given in ( [ deltag ] ) and ( [ del1x2 ] ) were the only ones extending @xmath86 then we would have essentially `` half '' of the affine kac - moody extension @xmath87 .",
    "however , there are additional transformations , which we shall denote by @xmath88 , that also extend @xmath86 .",

    "it is easy to verify that ( [ tddeldef ] ) describes symmetries of the lax equation .",
    "the easiest way to do this is to note that ( [ tddeldef ] ) implies @xmath95 , and so since @xmath96 , it is evident that the lax equation ( [ lax3 ] ) is indeed invariant under @xmath88 .",

    "since we have arrived at a somewhat different conclusion from schwarz , who finds only a subalgebra of the kac - moody algebra @xmath2 as a symmetry of the ssm @xcite , we shall discuss in appendix [ appa ] exactly why the difference has arisen .",

    "we shall show that a natural formulation of the model involves introducing an infinite number of additional scalar fields , in terms of which @xmath90 appearing in the lax equation ( [ lax2 ] ) can be expressed as a local quantity . the @xmath88 transformations act on this infinite tower of additional fields .",
    "we shall also show how this infinity of extra scalars can be interpreted as fields that one introduces in order to exhibit in a local fashion the symmetries arising from the closure of the two non - commuting @xmath13 symmetries of the original theory and a dualised version .",
    "a further remark about the kac - moody transformations @xmath63 and @xmath88 is also in order .",
    "the @xmath88 transformation defined in ( [ tddeldef ] ) are of the general form @xmath108 .",
    "it can be seen that the second of the three terms on the right - hand side of the @xmath83 transformation given in ( [ del1x2 ] ) is also of this general form .",
    "this means that as far as obtaining symmetries of the lax equation is concerned , one could have omitted the second term in ( [ del1x2 ] ) altogether , since it is itself a distinct symmetry in its own right .",
    "however , it actually serves an important purpose in ( [ del1x2 ] ) , namely to subtract out what would otherwise be a pole at @xmath109 if one had only @xmath110 rather than @xmath111 .",
    "( the third term is in ( [ del1x2 ] ) is necessary in addition , in order to get a symmetry , but there is no pole associated with this term , since we expand @xmath112 and @xmath77 around zero . )",
    "now , the derivations of the @xmath83 and @xmath113 transformations as symmetries involved considering the variation of @xmath114 in the lax equation ( [ lax3 ] ) . in the case of the @xmath88 transformation we have @xmath96 , and one may view @xmath113 as the solution of the homogeneous equation @xmath115 , whilst @xmath83 is the solution of the inhomogeneous equation @xmath116 .",
    "thus the inclusion of a @xmath113 contribution as the second term in ( [ del1x2 ] ) can be viewed as the necessary addition of a solution of the homogeneous solution that is needed in order to ensure that the inhomogeneous solution satisfies the necessary boundary condition ( that @xmath117 be regular at @xmath109 ) .",
    "this discussion also emphasises the point that it is really the @xmath63 transformations found by schwarz , appearing in our slightly modified form in ( [ del1x2 ] ) , that lie at the heart of the kac - moody symmetries of the symmetric - space sigma models .",
    "the @xmath88 transformations , although they are of course equally necessary in order to obtain the complete kac - moody symmetry , are somewhat secondary in nature since they are already present within the construction of the @xmath63 transformations .",
    "it is also worth remarking that we have obtained the full kac - moody algebra as a symmetry of the ssm by means of a purely perturbative analysis , which involved a small-@xmath50 expansion of @xmath62 around @xmath118 .",
    "one may also consider instead a large-@xmath50 expansion of @xmath62 , around @xmath119 .",
    "the result is in fact equivalent .",
    "this can be seen by letting @xmath120 , whereupon the lax equation ( [ lax3 ] ) becomes dx x^-1 = - * a - a. if we let @xmath121 , we arrive at a lax equation that is identical in form to the original expression ( [ lax3 ] ) , namely d x x^-1 = * a + a , showing that the large-@xmath50 expansion is equivalent to the small-@xmath122 expansion .",
    "one would therefore reach identical conclusions had one performed a large-@xmath50 expansion instead of a small-@xmath50 expansion .",
    "it would be interesting to study the regime where the small-@xmath50 and large-@xmath50 expansions overlap .",
    "although the lax equation is regular in both regions , it becomes singular at @xmath123 . even if such a non - perturbative analysis could be performed , we would not necessarily expect to find a larger symmetry algebra than the full kac - moody algebra , which is already found in our perturbative approach .",
    "the symmetry discussed in section [ kacmoodysec ] is an infinite - dimensional extension of the manifest @xmath0 symmetry of the @xmath14 symmetric - space sigma model .",
    "as such , the transformation parameters @xmath59 in ( [ deltag ] ) are themselves @xmath0 valued",
    ". there is an additional infinite - dimensional symmetry of the ssm , with transformation parameters that are singlets under @xmath0 , which turns out to be a subalgebra of the virasoro algebra .",
    "our discussion here again begins by using an approach that is very close to that of schwarz @xcite , although with certain modifications and elaborations .",
    "the transformations in question act on the coset representative @xmath40 as follows in equation ( [ vsym ] ) .",
    "however , since it is a singlet it plays no significant rle , and so it may be omitted without any risk of ambiguity . ]",
    "@xcite : ^v(t ) = , = -t x(t ) x(t)^-1.[vsym ] by equating the coefficients of each power of @xmath50 in ( [ vsym ] ) , one obtains an infinite set of transformations @xmath124 of the scalar fields in the ssm , with ) differ slightly from those given in @xcite , in which the lowest - order term is subtracted out and the overall @xmath50-dependent factor is different . our choice for the explicit @xmath50-dependent factor",
    "is made so that the algebra takes the simplest possible form .",

    "it is interesting to note that the entire `` negative half '' of the kac - moody symmetry ( @xmath16 with @xmath28 ) , which can be generated by multiple commutation of @xmath234 with @xmath16 with @xmath242 , emerges from the humble shift symmetry @xmath243 that we obtained in ( [ bepp ] ) .",

    "since the auxiliary fields also transform under the @xmath63 symmetries , one could view the @xmath88 transformations , in such a gauge - fixed situation , as compensating transformations that restored the fields to these chosen values after having performed @xmath63 transformations .",

    "the conclusion from ( [ delpcom ] ) is that if all the @xmath278 transformations ( [ schwtran ] ) are included in the symmetry algebra , then it is necessary to extend the algebra further by including the @xmath88 transformations too , in order to achieve closure .",

    "these , as we showed , generate the complete affine kac - moody extension @xmath2 of the original @xmath0 algebra .",
    "one can , alternatively , take a more restrictive viewpoint , which is effectively the one that was adopted by schwarz in @xcite .",
    "namely , the commutation relations ( [ delpcom ] ) imply that it is only if either @xmath275 or @xmath281 is a level-0 transformation that the @xmath88 transformations are generated .",

    "( we have taken @xmath275 to be a level-0 transformation in the second equation , for definiteness . )",
    "one can therefore avoid generating any @xmath88 transformations if one restricts the level-0 transformations in @xmath278 to be such that m_0 ^ -1_1^m_0 + _ 1=0.[herm2 ] this equation is essentially the condition that @xmath282 should belong to the denominator algebra @xmath24 of the coset model .",
    "this is most immediately clear if one chooses , as one may , the `` gauge '' in which @xmath283 .",
    "equation ( [ herm2 ] ) then implies that @xmath59 is anti - hermitean , which is precisely the standard condition for it to lie in the denominator algebra @xmath24 .",
    "if some other gauge choice is made for @xmath277 , then @xmath59 is again required to be in the denominator algebra , in a basis conjugated by @xmath277 .",

    "this , therefore , accounts for the symmetry algebra that was found by schwarz in @xcite .",
    "the full kac - moody symmetry algebra @xmath2 is generated by our @xmath63 and @xmath88 transformations , whilst schwarz s subalgebra , which he denoted by @xmath20 , corresponds to the transformations @xmath278 given in ( [ deltapdef ] ) , with the further restriction that at level-0 the @xmath30 transformations are omitted .",
    "omitting these particular transformations is precisely what is needed in order to maintain a fixed boundary condition for @xmath277 ( such as @xmath283 ) . in the gauge choice @xmath283",

    "it can easily be verified directly that the generators @xmath285 form a closed subalgebra of the full kac - moody algebra ( [ kacmoody2 ] ) .",
    "the schwarz subalgebra of the kac - moody algebra can be interpreted as follows . by writing @xmath62 as in ( [ pathi ] ) , a choice has been made to set @xmath287 at the point @xmath272 in the two - dimensional spacetime .",
    "this can be viewed as a gauge - fixing that is achieved by using the @xmath88 transformations .",
    "furthermore , as we remarked below ( [ yyy ] ) , @xmath277 must be held fixed , which is a further gauge fixing ( of the original sigma - model fields ) , achieved by using the @xmath30 part of the original @xmath0 lie algebra transformations . in other words , only the @xmath24 part of the original @xmath0 symmetry survives .",
    "if we wish instead to retain the full algebra @xmath0 of original symmetries , then schwarz s subalgebra will necessarily have to be extended to the full kac - moody algebra @xmath2 .",
    "it is instructive to look at this truncated subalgebra in the concrete example of the @xmath3 sigma model that we studied in section [ sl2rsec ] . especially , it is interesting to look at the transformations of the original @xmath13 symmetry and the dual @xmath31 symmetry , to see which are retained and which are truncated out in the subalgebra .",
    "the combinations of kac - moody generators @xmath16 that lie in @xmath30 and in @xmath24 are given , respectively , by : & & j^0_n,(j^+_n + j^-_n ) , + & & + : & & ( j^+_n - j^-_n ) .",

    "[ schwtrunc2 ] since the @xmath13 transformations correspond to the kac - moody generators @xmath29 , and the @xmath31 transformations correspond to the generators @xmath234 , @xmath288 and @xmath289 , it suffices to consider just the levels @xmath290 and @xmath291 in ( [ schwtrunc2 ] ) .",
    "these give the four following non - vanishing generators : n=0 : & & j_0^=2(j^+_0 - j^-_0 ) , + & & + n=1 : & & j_1^=j^0_1 -j^0_-1 , + & & j_1^=j^+_1 + j^-_1 - j^+_-1 - j^-_-1 , + & & j_1^=j^+_1 - j^-_1 + j^+_-1 - j^-_-1 .",
    "we see that just two of the five inequivalent transformations in @xmath13 and @xmath31 are retained within the truncated algebra : ^ ( ^+-^- ) , ( j_1 ^ -j_1^ ) ( ^+ -^- ) .",
    "thus , the infinite - dimensional subalgebra of the full kac - moody algebra that is retained in the truncation ( [ schwtrunc ] ) omits not only the @xmath30 generators in the original @xmath13 , but also the @xmath30 generators in the dual symmetry algebra @xmath31 .",
    "if one wants to have a symmetry algebra that at least contains all the generators of the original and the dual @xmath13 algebras then , as we showed in section [ gerochsec ] , this will necessarily be the full kac - moody algebra .",
    "in section [ virasorosubsec ] we obtained a virasoro - like symmetry of the symmetric - space sigma models , with generators @xmath139 satisfying the algebra ( [ valg2 ] ) .",
    "our construction was closely related to one given in @xcite but there were significant differences , which we shall elaborate on here .",
    "the first respect in which our discussion diverges from that in @xcite is that in that paper , the quantity @xmath292 appearing in the our transformation @xmath293 ( see ( [ vsym ] ) ) is replaced by ( t)= ( t^2 - 1 ) x(t ) x(t)^-1 + i,[schwarzxi ] where = .",
    "one can see from the path - ordered integral expression ( [ pathi ] ) for @xmath62 that x(t)= 1 + t + o(t^2 ) , and so in fact @xmath294 .",
    "thus from ( [ schwarzxi ] ) we see that schwarz s @xmath295 and our @xmath125 are related by ( t ) = ( t)-_t=0 .[tdxi ] thus the lowest mode in our transformation is excluded in the pcm analysis in @xcite .",
    "the lowest mode had to be excluded in @xcite for the principal chiral model , as opposed to the symmetric - space sigma model , in order to ensure that the transformation was a symmetry of the equations of motion . in brief , the transformation of @xmath46 under @xmath125 ( defined as in ( [ vsym ] ) ) in the pcm case is simply @xmath296 , rather than ( [ delva ] ) of the ssm case , and so using ( [ dxx ] ) one finds ^v a= * d(t^-1 ) + 11-t^2 a + * a. this means that @xmath297 , and so the equation of motion @xmath126 is not preserved . however",
    ", if the lowest - order term in @xmath298 is subtracted out , as is done in ( [ tdxi ] ) , then the resulting transformation @xmath299 _ does _ give a symmetry .",
    "although schwarz carried over the assumption that the lowest mode should also be subtracted out when he then considered the ssm case , it is actually no longer necessary to do so , as we explained in section [ virasorosubsec ] .",
    "as we showed there , with the transformation @xmath300 now given by ( [ delva ] ) , one finds using ( [ dxx ] ) and ( [ dmxx ] ) that the contributions to @xmath300 of the form @xmath132 coming from the two terms in ( [ delva ] ) cancel out , and so @xmath130 automatically , without the need to subtract the lowest mode term .",
    "the upshot is that the set of virasoro - like symmetries that we find for the symmetric - space sigma models is actually larger then the set obtained by schwarz in @xcite , by virtue of the inclusion of the lowest mode in @xmath298 .",
    "a second difference between our results and those in @xcite is concerned with the precise form of the virasoro - like algebra in the two cases .",
    "we were able to make a convenient choice of @xmath301 as the prefactor of @xmath302 in ( [ vsym ] ) which gave the algebra in the form ( [ valg2 ] ) , which is very close in structure to the virasoro algebra . on the other hand , in @xcite",
    "the choice of @xmath50-dependent prefactor was apparently constrained by certain requirements of matching between left and right acting transformations on the group manifold of the pcm ( a consideration that does not apply in the ssm case ) .",
    "this led to the choice of @xmath303 prefactor that was made in @xcite , and this in turn led to the rather different algebra = ( m - n)(k_m+n+1- k_m+n-1 ) for the pcm case .",

    "<S> there has not been universal agreement as to exactly what the extended symmetry algebra is , with different arguments seemingly concluding either that it is @xmath1 , the affine kac - moody extension of @xmath0 , or else a subalgebra thereof . </S>",
    "<S> we take the very explicit approach of schwarz as our starting point for studying the simpler situation of two - dimensional flat - space sigma models , which nonetheless capture all the essential details . </S>",
    "<S> we arrive at the conclusion that the full symmetry is described by the kac - moody algebra @xmath2 , whilst the subalgebra obtained by schwarz arises as a gauge - fixed truncation . </S>",
    "<S> we then consider the explicit example of the @xmath3 coset , and relate schwarz s approach to an earlier discussion that goes back to the work of geroch .    </S>",
