    "@xcite identified the phenomenon of shear dispersion in which a passive scalar , e.g.  a chemical pollutant , released in a pipe poiseuille flow spreads along the pipe according to a diffusion law .",

    "the match between the values of @xmath64 derived from the eigenvalue problem and those obtained by monte carlo sampling provides a direct check on the validity of the large - deviation theory .",
    "the discrepancy between the exact @xmath64 and its diffusive approximation confirms that diffusion overestimates the dispersion speed , as inferred already from the plot of @xmath113 . the finite support of the concentration distribution for @xmath175 $ ] , arising from the neglect of longitudinal molecular diffusion , is also hinted at by the large slopes of @xmath4 for @xmath176 .",
    "the large-@xmath177 approximation to @xmath64 ( with @xmath171 term fixed by inspection ) is seen to be accurate for @xmath178 and could be combined with the small @xmath111 approximation to provide a satisfactory uniform approximation .    the third panel on the left of figure [ fig : shearall ] shows the map between @xmath154 that arises as part of the legendre transform .",
    "this identifies the location @xmath157 which control the corresponding exponential moment @xmath179 for large @xmath7 .",
    "finally , the fourth panel shows profiles of the eigenfunctions @xmath180 of ( [ eqn : eig - disp ] ) for several values of @xmath95 . according to ( [ eqn : cond ] ) ,",
    "these give the structure of the concentration profile for @xmath181 larger than @xmath154 .",
    "thus , for instance , the eigenfunction for @xmath182 approximately corresponds to @xmath183 ( see third panel ) . as @xmath95 and hence @xmath111 increase ( or decrease )",
    "the profile becomes more and more localised in the region of maximum ( or minimum ) velocity , that is , near @xmath173 ( @xmath174 ) .",
    "the eigenfunctions for finite @xmath95 are to be contrasted with the standard ( homogenisation ) results on taylor dispersion which correspond to eigenfunctions that are small , @xmath80 perturbations to the uniform eigenfunction @xmath184 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the eigenfunctions of ( [ eqn : eig1 ] ) shown in figure [ fig : efunctionpe250 ] for three different values of @xmath185 illustrate different regimes of dispersion that arise at increasingly larger distances from the scalar - release point . for small @xmath18 and hence for small @xmath186 , @xmath42 is almost uniform : a gentle @xmath187 gradient in the cell interiors is compensated by a rapid change in boundary layers that appear around the separatrices in agreement with the homogenisation treatment . for larger @xmath16 and @xmath186 , @xmath42 inside the cell is no longer close to uniform ; instead , it is approximately constant along streamlines but varies across streamlines , from small values at the centre to large values near the separatrices .",
    "again , boundary layers around the separatrices ensure periodicity .",
    "finally , for large @xmath18 and @xmath186 , @xmath42 is close to zero in the cell interiors and the scalar is confined within boundary layers .",
    "this qualitative description of the eigenfunctions is consistent with the evolution of the scalar field shown in figure [ fig : simu250 ] ; it is supported by the asymptotics results reported in part ii .",
    "this paper discusses the statistics of passive scalars or particles dispersing in fluids under the combined action of advection and molecular diffusion .",
    "it shows how large - deviation theory provides an approximation to the scalar concentration or particle - position pdf in the large - time limit .",
    "this approximation , expressed in terms of the rate function @xmath39 , is valid in the tail of the distribution as well as in the core ; it considerably generalises the more usual diffusive approximation which characterises the dispersion by a single effective - diffusivity tensor .",
    "the rate function is deduced from the solution of the generalised cell problem ( [ eqn : eig1 ] ) , a one or two - parameter family of eigenvalue problems that generalise the cell problem solved when computing the effective diffusivity using the method of homogenisation .",
    "the application to shear flows reveals features of the dispersion that are not captured by the standard theory of shear dispersion initiated by @xcite .",
    "in particular , it shows that the diffusive approximation dramatically overestimates scalar concentrations far away from the centre of mass .",
    "the reason for this is that the mechanism underlying shear dispersion ",
    "the interaction between shear and cross - stream molecular diffusion  leads to along - flow dispersion with a finite speed , namely the maximum flow speed .",
    "the non - zero concentrations beyond the limits imposed by this finite speed are entirely attributable to molecular diffusion and thus controlled by molecular rather than effective diffusivity . at intermediate distances from the centre of mass , however ,",
    "the non - diffusive effects can in some cases increase and in some cases decrease dispersion .",
    "this can be detected in some of the results for standard shear flows displayed in figure [ fig : shearall ] or be deduced from the order - by - order corrections to the diffusive approximation discussed in ",
    "[ sec : hom ] .",
    "our analysis of spatially periodic flows and , in particular , of the classical cellular flow further demonstrates the benefits of large - deviation theory over homogenisation and the resulting diffusive approximation .",
    "the anisotropy of the dispersion in this flow , for instance , although a clear consequence of the streamline arrangement , is overlooked by the diffusive approximation but quantified by large deviation . as for shear flows , there is also a finite speed effect for the dispersion in cellular flow ; this is more subtle and is elucidated in part ii which devoted to a detailed analysis to the large-@xmath3 limit .",
    "the differences between the diffusive and large - deviation approximations for the scalar concentration are significant at large enough distances away from the centre of mass of the scalar .",
    "since the concentration at such distances is small , large deviation applied to problems involving purely passive scalars is of practical importance in situations where low concentrations matter , as would be the case , for instance , for very toxic chemicals . in such applications",
    "the logarithm of the concentration is often a relevant measure of the chemical s impact ; it is read off from the rate function since @xmath188 .",
    "as mentioned in  1 , for scalars that are reacting , the properties of dispersion at large distances embodied in @xmath4 can be critical in determining the main features of the scalar distribution .",
    "this was made explicit in the work of @xcite and @xcite which relates the speed of propagation of fronts for scalars experiencing f - kpp - type reactions to the rate function @xmath39 characterising passive dispersion .",
    "following from this relationship , the results of the present paper and of part ii can be used to predict front speeds in a range of shear and periodic flows .",
    "we will report elsewhere the novel predictions that can be obtained in this manner @xcite .",
    "we conclude by remarking that the large - deviation treatment of scalar dispersion can be extended to a class of flows much broader than that considered in the present paper .",
    "dispersion in time - periodic flows , random flows and turbulent flows can also be characterised by a rate function to improve on the approximation provided by effective diffusivity . in the time - periodic case",
    "an extension of the theory discussed in  2 is straightforward : the eigenfunction @xmath42 in ( [ eqn : largedevi ] ) should depend on @xmath7 as well as on @xmath6 and @xmath45 , leading to an additional term @xmath189 in the eigenvalue problem ( [ eqn : eig1 ] ) and to the requirement that @xmath42 be time periodic which determines the eigenvalue @xmath20 . in the random case , under the assumption of homogeneous and stationary statistics for @xmath190 ,",
    "@xmath20 is determined by the analogous requirement that @xmath42 , a random function , be homogeneous and stationary .",
    "implementing this requirement is not straightforward , however , and monte carlo methods with importance sampling of the types described in appendix b may be best suited for the computation of the rate function .",

    "it follows from the scaled large - deviation form of @xmath125 for shear flows ( [ eqn : cdisp ] ) that @xmath191 in these expressions , @xmath95 is related to @xmath192 by @xmath193 and factors @xmath194 describing the error in the wkb - like expansion ( [ eqn : cdisp ] ) are omitted .",
