    "the combination of nonperturbative unitary techniques in coupled channels with the qcd information contained in the chiral lagrangians has allowed one to extend the application domain of traditional chiral perturbation theory to a much larger range of energies where many low lying meson and baryon resonances appear . for instance , for the interactions between the members of the lightest octet of pseudoscalars , one starts with the chiral lagrangian of ref .",
    "@xcite and selects the set of channels that couple to certain quantum numbers .",
    "then , independently of using either the bethe - salpeter equation in coupled channels @xcite , the n / d method @xcite or the inverse amplitude method @xcite , the well known scalar resonances @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 appear as poles in the obtained l=0 meson - meson partial waves .",
    "these resonances are not introduced by hand , they appear naturally as a consequence of the meson interaction and they qualify as ordinary bound states or resonances in coupled channels . these are states that we call dynamically generated , by contrast to other states which would rather qualify as @xmath11 states , such as the @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "similarly , in the baryon sector , the interaction of the pseudoscalar mesons with baryons of the octet of the proton generates dynamically @xmath13 resonances @xcite and the interaction of the pseudoscalar mesons with baryons of the decuplet of the @xmath14 generates @xmath15 resonances @xcite .",
    "these last two cases can be unified using su(6 ) symmetry as done in @xcite .",
    "this field has proved quite productive and has been further extended by combining pseudoscalar mesons with vector mesons , which lead to the dynamical generation of axial vector mesons like the @xmath16 , @xmath17 , etc @xcite .",
    "also in the charm sector one has obtained in this way scalar mesons with charm , like the @xmath18 @xcite , axial vector mesons with charm like the @xmath19 @xcite , or hidden charm scalars like a predicted @xmath20 state and two hidden charm axial states , with opposite c - parity , one of which corresponds to the @xmath21 state . in what follows",
    "we briefly discuss these latter cases .",
    "paralelly with these developments investigation has started regarding systems with three hadrons not studied so far , like two mesons and a baryon , or three mesons .",
    "a new formalism is developed , based on the faddeev equations and the on shell scattering amplitudes of the different components .",
    "this can be done because one can prove that there are cancellations between the off shell part of these amplitudes and the three body contact forces that originate from the same chiral lagrangians .",
    "this novel finding should stimulate thoughts around conventional faddeev equations which rely upon the full off shell extrapolation of the amplitudes , and eventually require some three body forces that must be put by hand to reproduce the data .",
    "i shall report on several states which are obtained within this new formalism and which can be associated to well known resonances .",
    "as shown in detail in @xcite , starting from a standard chiral lagrangian for the interaction of pseudoscalar mesons of the octet of the @xmath22 and vector mesons of the octet of the @xmath12 , and unitarizing in coupled channels solving the coupled bethe - salpeter equations , one obtains the scattering matrix for pseudoscalar mesons with vectors for different quantum numbers , which contains poles that can be associated to known resonances like the @xmath16 , @xmath17 , etc .",
    "the su(3 ) decomposition of @xmath23 @xmath24 leads here to two octets , unlike in the case of the interaction of pseudoscalars among themselves where there is only room for the @xmath25 representation .",
    "this is why here one finds different g - parity states like the @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the @xmath28 , @xmath29 , plus an extra @xmath30 that one can identify with the singlet state .",
    "one should then find two @xmath31 states , which do not have defined g - parity .",
    "one might think that these states are the @xmath0 and the @xmath32 states .",
    "however the theory fails to predict a state with such a large mass as the @xmath32 and with its decay properties .",
    "instead , in @xcite two states were found with masses close by , given , after some fine tuning , by 1197 mev and 1284 mev , and widths of about 240 mev and 140 mev , respectively @xcite .",
    "the interesting thing about these states is that the first one couples most strongly to @xmath33 , while the second state couples most strongly to @xmath34 .",
    "one could hope that these two states could be observed experimentally .",
    "indeed , this is the case as was shown in the recent work @xcite by looking at two reactions which have either @xmath33 or @xmath34 in the final state and which clearly show the peak at different positions , as one can observe in fig .",
    "[ fig : cern3 ] .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     very interesting and novel in the present approach is the generation of the x(3872 ) with positive c - parity and another state nearly degenerate with negative c - parity",
    ". it would be interesting to see if a state with negative c - parity is observed , but the large branching fraction @xmath35 indicates either a very large g - parity ( isospin ) violation ( quite unlikely ) , or the existence of another state with different c - parity ( g - parity also in this case ) .",
    "we discussed before how the low lying @xmath13 baryon resonances appear dynamically generated in the chiral unitary approach .",
    "the low lying @xmath1 resonances are not less problematic and quark models have difficulties in reproducing them @xcite . experimentally some of them",
    "are poorly understood and few of them possess four - star status . among the rest",
    "some resonances are listed with unknown spin parity and two are controversial in nature .",
    "the situation is slightly better with the @xmath36 resonances in the same energy region , except for the @xmath36(1600 ) and @xmath36(1810 ) , where the peak positions and widths , obtained by different partial wave analysis groups , vary a lot .",
    "many of these s=@xmath2 states seem to have significant branching ratios for three - body , i.e. , two meson - one baryon , decay channels .",
    "however , no theoretical attempt has been made to study the three body structure of these resonances , until recently when a coupled channel calculation for two meson one baryon system was carried out using chiral dynamics @xcite .",
    "we take advantage of the fact that there are strong correlations in the meson baryon sector in l=0 , and with s=@xmath2 one obtains many @xmath13 resonances .",
    "the @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) couples strongly to the @xmath39 and its coupled channels . considering this we build the three body coupled channels by adding a pion to combinations of a pseudoscalar meson of the @xmath40 su(3 ) octet and a baryon of the @xmath1 octet which couple to @xmath41 . for the total charge zero of the three body system we get twenty - two coupled channels .",
    "details can be seen in @xcite .    to solve the faddeev equations we write the two body @xmath42-matrices using unitary chiral dynamics .",
    "these @xmath42-matrices can be split into an on - shell part , depending only on the respective center of mass energy , and an off - shell part , which is inversely proportional to the propagator of the off - shell particle .",
    "this off - shell part cancels a propagator in the three body scattering diagrams , leading to a diagram with a topological structure equivalent to that of a three body force @xcite . to this",
    ", one must add the three body forces originating directly from the chiral lagrangians .",
    "interestingly , in our case , we find that the three body forces from the two sources cancel in the su(3 ) limit . in a realistic case , we find them to sum - up to merely 5 % of the total on - shell contribution of the @xmath42-matrices to the faddeev equations . the formalism is thus developed further in terms of the on - shell parts of the two body @xmath42-matrices .",
    "we begin with faddeev equations @xmath43 which , if iterated while neglecting the terms with @xmath44 , corresponding to the disconnected diagrams , will give @xmath45    in order to convert the faddeev equations into a set of algebraic equations one writes the terms with three successive interactions explicitly , which already involve a loop evaluation .",
    "one finds technically how to go from the diagrams with two interactions to those with three interactions and the algorithm found is then used for the next iterations , leading thus to a set of algebraic equations , which are solved within twenty two coupled channels .",
    "the resulting faddeev equations have been solved with the input two body @xmath42-matrices obtained by solving the bethe - salpeter equation as in @xcite .",
    "we find four @xmath46 and two @xmath36 states as dynamically generated resonances from a two meson - one baryon system , which we associate to known resonances of the pdg @xcite , implying a strong coupling of the s=@xmath2 resonances , in this region , to the three body decay channels . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we plot the modulus square of the t - matrix as a function of two variables , the total energy and the invariant mass of particles two and three .",
    "we show results for one of the resonances , corresponding to the @xmath46(1660 ) @xcite found in our study in the squared amplitude for the @xmath47 channel , and in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we show the results for the @xmath48 .",
    "in addition to this , we find evidence for ( 1 ) another @xmath1 resonance , i.e. , the @xmath46(1770 ) , ( 2 ) for the controversial @xmath46(1620 ) and ( 3 ) for the @xmath46(1560 ) , which is listed with unknown spin - parity @xcite . in the isospin 0 sector we find evidence for the @xmath36 ( 1600 ) and @xmath36 ( 1810 ) .    in a recent paper @xcite the work has been extended to the sector with @xmath49 .",
    "there one finds neatly the @xmath4 as a resonant state of @xmath50 , but the roper @xmath5 does not show up , indicating a far more complicated structure , as one may guess from the study of @xcite , where the @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 channels , with interactions additional to those used in the approach of @xcite are considered . in this paper one",
    "can find in detail the cancellations between the off shell parts of the amplitudes and the three body forces coming from the chiral lagrangians that we have mentioned above .",
    "the signal for the @xmath4 is seen in fig .",
    "[ 1710_1 ] .",
    "( 1660 ) resonance in the @xmath47 channel . ]    a @xmath36 resonance in the @xmath54 amplitude at 1568 mev in @xmath55 = 0 , @xmath56 = 1/2.,scaledwidth=85.0% ]     system in isospin 1/2 configuration as a function of @xmath57 and @xmath58.__,scaledwidth=85.0% ]    finally we would like to report on the recent work on the generation of the x(2175 ) resonance found at babar in the @xmath59 @xcite and also confirmed at bes in the study of the @xmath60 decay mode @xcite .",
    "the work has been done in @xcite with the same three body scheme using the particles @xmath6 .",
    "a neat resonance is found around 2150 mev with a width compatible with experiment , see fig .",
    "[ ampsq ] .",
    "as mentioned above , we plot the modulus square of the @xmath61 matrix as a function of two variables , the total energy and the invariant mass of the @xmath62 subsystem .",
    "we not only find the mass on the right place , but we also find the peak of the @xmath62 invariant mass at the @xmath8 position , indicating that the system of three particles is strongly correlated in a @xmath63 and the @xmath8 as found in the experiment .     squared amplitude in the isospin 0 configuration . ]    in this latter work we also evaluated the quantitative effect of cancellation of the off - shell part of the amplitudes with the three body forces .",
    "if the later are omitted , keeping the off shell dependence of the amplitudes , the peak still appears but shifted by 40 mev at lower energies .",
    "the cancellation between the off shell terms of the amplitudes and the three body forces has thus a nontrivial consequence if omitted .",
    "if we look at it from a different perspective , we can say that should one had used the full off shell extrapolation of the amplitudes one would have to add the effects of the three body force , which in this case would induce a shift of 40 mev in the mass of the resonance .",
    "to conclude , we are finding a new picture for the low lying @xmath1 baryon states with @xmath41 , which largely correspond to bound states or resonances of two mesons and a baryon . in the @xmath49 sector",
    "we find a clear signal for the @xmath4 , which has a very large branching ratio for decay into @xmath50 in the pdg , but not for the @xmath5 .",
    "this negative result for the roper should rather be interpreted in positive terms as a clear indication that the @xmath50 that we study is not the most important component of the roper structure , hinting , together with the study of @xcite , at a very complex structure for the @xmath5 . in the three meson sector",
    "a clear peak could be seen for the three body interacting system @xmath6 , strongly correlated around the @xmath64 , reflecting the strong coupling of the @xmath8 resonance to @xmath62 , the main building block of the @xmath8 as a dynamically generated resonance .",
