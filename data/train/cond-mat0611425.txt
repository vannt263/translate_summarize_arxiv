    "liquid crystal elastomers  @xcite are soft amorphous solids that have the macroscopic symmetry properties of liquid crystals  @xcite . usually , they consist of crosslinked side - chain or main - chain liquid crystal polymers . in their smectic phases ,",
    "these elastomers possess a plane - like , lamellar modulation of density in one direction . in the smectic-@xmath0 ( sm@xmath0 ) phase , the director describing the average orientation of constituent mesogens is parallel to the normal to the smectic layers whereas in the smectic-@xmath1 ( sm@xmath1 ) phase",
    ", it has a component in the plane of the layers .",
    "various unusual properties of smectic elastomers have been discovered to date experimentally and/or theoretically , some of which are truly remarkable . for example , in smectic elastomers the crosslinking can suppress the landau - peierls - instability  @xcite that leads to a breakdown of one - dimensional long - range order in other layered systems such as stacked surfactant membranes   or conventional smectic liquid crystals  .",
    "depending on the chemical composition of the material  @xcite , the stabilizing effect of the elastic network can be strong enough to allow for the persistence of one - dimensional long - range order over several microns  .",
    "sm@xmath0 elastomers exhibit a non - hookean elasticity when stretched along the normal of the smectic layers with a high young s modulus @xmath2 for strains below a threshold of about @xmath3 and a considerably smaller @xmath2 for strains above that threshold  @xcite .",
    "sm@xmath1 elastomers prepared by crosslinking in the sm@xmath0 phase followed by a cooling into the sm@xmath1 phase , like nematic elastomers  @xcite , are predicted to exhibit the phenomenon of _ soft elasticity _  @xcite .",
    "the phase transition from the sm@xmath0 to the sm@xmath1 phase is associated with a spontaneous breaking of the rotational invariance in the smectic plane .",
    "the goldstone mode of this symmetry breaking is manifests itself in the vanishing of certain shear moduli as well as the vanishing of the energy cost of certain nonlinear extensional strains .",
    "it is the interplay between elastic and liquid crystalline degrees of freedom that leads to these and other phenomena that are neither present in conventional rubber nor in conventional liquid crystals .",
    "the effects of this interplay are strongest in ideal , monodomain samples of liquid crystal elastomers , with a homogeneous orientation of constituent mesogens .",
    "generically , liquid crystal elastomers tend to segregate into many domains , each having its own local frank director @xmath4 specifying the direction of mesogenic order . in order to avoid such polydomain samples , elaborate synthetization methods have been developed and applied to smectic elastomers for more than ten years now  .",
    "most fruitful , perhaps , have been multistage crosslinking techniques that allow for monodomain samples that neither need to be confined between director - aligning plates nor need to be kept in director - aligning external fields .",
    "these techniques have been used , for example , to synthesize elastomers with a permanent , macroscopically ordered sm@xmath0 monodomain structure  @xcite as well as monodomain sm@xmath1 elastomers that exhibit reversible phase transitions to the sm@xmath0 and isotropic phases in response to temperature change  .    despite the successes in understanding the static properties of smectic elastomers and the advances in their synthesis ,",
    "dynamical experiments on these materials , such as rheology experiments of storage and loss moduli or brillouin scattering measurements of sound velocities , have not been reported to date . to interpret these kinds of experiments once they are done , it is desirable to have theories for the low - frequency , long - wavelength dynamics of smectic elastomers .",
    "recently , we introduced such a theory for sm@xmath1 elastomers  @xcite . here",
    ", we present this work in more detail and we extend it to the sm@xmath0 and biaxial smectic phases . to keep our discussion as simple as possible , we will exclusively consider elastomers , that have been crosslinked in the sm@xmath0 phase , so that the smectic layers are locked to the crosslinked network  . to be specific , we will consider sm@xmath0 elastomers crosslinked in the sm@xmath0 phase and soft sm@xmath1 elastomers that form spontaneously from these sm@xmath0 elastomers when temperature falls below the sm@xmath0-to - sm@xmath1 transition temperature .",
    "in addition to these materials , we study soft biaxial smectic elastomers that also could form spontaneously from a sm@xmath0 elastomer , at least in principle , but that may be , as biaxial phases in general , hard to find in nature .",
    "we include these elastomers in our study mainly because their dynamics is similar to but simpler than that of soft sm@xmath1 elastomers and , therefore , has a potential pedagogical value .",
    "our theories fall into two categories .",
    "the first category is pure hydrodynamics which describes the dynamics of those degrees of freedom whose characteristic frequencies @xmath5 vanish as wavenumber @xmath6 goes to zero .",
    "these theories focus on the very leading low - frequency , long - wavelength behavior and apply for frequencies @xmath5 such that @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the longest non - hydrodynamic decay time in the system . as in conventional elastic media ,",
    "our hydrodynamic theories involve only the elastic displacement field @xmath9 and not the director @xmath4 , which relaxes to the local strain in a non - hydrodynamic time @xmath10 .",
    "the second category of theories explicitly includes @xmath4 and applies for a larger range of frequencies than pure hydrodynamics .",
    "one motivation for setting up these theories is to better understand the role of @xmath4 in the dynamics of smectic elastomers .",
    "the other motivation is that dynamical experiments , like rheology measurements , typically probe a wide range of frequencies that extends from the hydrodynamic regime to frequencies well above it , and that , therefore , theories going beyond hydrodynamics could be valuable for interpreting these experiments .",
    "our theories with displacement and director assume that @xmath10 is the longest non - hydrodynamic relaxation time , @xmath11 , and that @xmath10 is well separated from the next longest non - hydrodynamic time @xmath12 , which we refer to as elastomer time .",
    "the specific origin of @xmath12 is not essential to our work .",
    "for example , @xmath12 might stem from rouse - like dynamics of the polymers constituting the elastomeric matrix .",
    "provided the assumption @xmath13 holds , our dynamics with @xmath9 and @xmath4 applies for @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the outline of the remainder of this paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ dynamicalequationsreview ] briefly reviews the well established poisson bracket formalism for coarse grained variables as well as the resulting equations of motion , when this formalism is applied to liquid crystal elastomers .",
    "section  [ smadynamics ] discusses the dynamics of sm@xmath0 elastomers with strain and director .",

    "section  [ smcdynamicsstraindir ] presents our theory for sm@xmath1 s with strain and director .",
    "section  [ concludingremarks ] contains concluding remarks .",
    "there are two appendixes that , respectively , compile results for elastic constants and provide some details of our calculations .",
    "@xcite , where we studied the dynamics of nematic elastomers , we applied the poisson bracket formalism for coarse - grained variables to derive hydrodynamical equations for the displacement and momentum density as well as equations of motion that in addition involve the frank director .",
    "the validity of these equations is , however , not limited to nematics .",
    "our hydrodynamical equations apply for conventional elastomers as well as for the usual ( one component ) liquid crystal elastomers in , e.g. , their isotropic , nematic and smectic phases .",
    "our dynamical equations involving @xmath4 are valid for any liquid crystal elastomer with a defined director , like nematic and smectic elastomers . in this section",
    "we review the dynamical equations derived in ref .",
    "@xcite to provide important background information , to stage known results that we will need as input as we move along and to establish notation .",
    "stochastic dynamical equations for coarse - grained fields  @xcite can be obtained by combining the poisson - bracket formalisms of classical mechanics @xcite and the langevin @xcite approach to stochastic dynamics .",
    "the poisson - bracket formalism ensures that the resulting equations of motion are , in the absence of dissipation , invariant under time reversal .",
    "the langevin approach provides a description of dissipative processes and noise forces .",
    "let @xmath16 , @xmath17 be a set of coarse - grained fields that describe the long - wavelength , low - frequency dynamics of a system , i.e. , they are hydrodynamic or quasihydrodynamic variables whose characteristic decay times in the long - wavelength limit are much larger than microscopic decay times .",
    "the dynamical equations for @xmath18 are first - order differential equations in time : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the a coarse - grained hamiltonian that describes the statistical mechanics of the fields @xmath16 . in eq .",
    "( [ genharvard ] ) and in the remainder of this paper the einstein summation convention is understood .",

    "the reactive term couples @xmath22 to @xmath23 only if @xmath24 and @xmath25 have opposite signs under time reversal ( when external magnetic fields are zero ) .",

    "@xmath26 is the so - called dissipative tensor .",
    "it may depend on the fields @xmath16 and it may contain @xmath27 , where @xmath28 .",
    "its specifics are determined by three principles : ( i ) @xmath26 couples @xmath22 to @xmath23 only if @xmath24 and @xmath25 have the same sign under time reversal .",
    "( ii ) by virtue of the onsager principle  @xcite , it must be symmetric in the absence of external magnetic fields .",
    "( iii ) @xmath26 has to be compatible with the symmetries of the dynamic system .    when eq .",
    "( [ genharvard ] ) is augmented by a noise term @xmath29 , it represents a stochastic or langevin equation that cound be used , for example , to set up a dynamic functional  @xcite to study the effects of nonlinearities and fluctuations via dynamical field theory . in this paper",
    ", we will ignore the effects of noise .",
    "pure hydrodynamics describes the leading low - frequency , long - wavelength behavior of a system , i.e. , it accounts exclusively for those degrees of freedom whose characteristic frequencies @xmath5 vanish in the limit of vanishing wavenumber .",
    "there are two general classes of hydrodynamic variables : conserved variables and broken symmetry variables .",
    "a single - component liquid crystal elastomer has five conserved variables , viz .",
    "the energy density @xmath30 , the mass density @xmath31 , and the three components of the momentum density @xmath32 .",
    "there are three broken - symmetry variables , namely the three components of the elastic displacement . throughout this paper",
    ", we will use lagrangian coordinates in which @xmath33 labels a mass point in the unstretched ( reference ) material and @xmath34 labels the position of the mass point @xmath33 in the stretched ( target ) material , so that the broken - symmetry displacement variable is @xmath35 . since liquid crystal elastomers are , as any elastomers , permanently crosslinked , the mass density and the displacement are not independent .",
    "rather , changes @xmath36 in mass density are locked to changes in volume such that in the linearized limit @xmath37 .",
    "thus , there are in total @xmath38 independent hydrodynamic variables and @xmath38 associated hydrodynamic modes .    in the following",
    ", we will consider only isothermal processes so that the energy density , which is associated with heat diffusion , can be ignored .",
    "this leaves us with six hydrodynamical variables , the components of the momentum density @xmath39 and the displacement @xmath40 .",
    "these are independent variables at the reference point @xmath33 that satisfy the continuum generalizations of the usual relations for the momentum and displacement of a particle : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "these relations yield a non - vanishing poisson bracket between @xmath44 and @xmath45 : @xmath46 .",
    "the @xmath47 and @xmath48 poisson brackets are zero . using these results and the fact that the coarse - grained kinetic energy reads @xmath49 , one obtains the coarse - grained equations of motion    [ genstructsimple ] @xmath50    here an in the following we use the convention that indices from the middle of the alphabet , @xmath51 , run from 1 to 3 ( corresponding to the @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 directions ) .",
    "@xmath55 is the elastic energy describing the elastomer with @xmath56 the corresponding elastic energy density .",
    "the specifics of @xmath56 depend on the particular elastomeric phase under consideration and will be discussed as we go along .",
    "the absence of any dissipative term proportional to @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ eomsimple1a ] ) , which would describe permeation , reflects the tethered or crosslinked character of the elastomer .",
    "pure couplings of @xmath58 to @xmath59 are forbidden because eqs .",
    "( [ genstructsimple ] ) have to obey galileian invariance , and thus the components of the dissipative tensor coupling @xmath58 to @xmath59 are of the form @xmath60 , with @xmath61 being the viscosity tensor . in our discussion of the hydrodynamics of the biaxial smectic and the sm@xmath1 phase , to be presented in sections  [ biaxialhydrodynamics ] and [ smchydrodynamics ]",
    ", we will restrict ourselves for simplicity to frequencies @xmath5 that are much less than the inverse characteristic time @xmath62 associated with the viscosities . in this limit",
    ", the @xmath61 can be viewed as local in time , or equivalently , their temporal fourier transforms can be considered as being constant .    to discuss the dynamics of the individual smectic phases in detail , it will be convenient to combine eqs .",
    "( [ eomsimple1a ] ) and ( [ eomsimple1b ] ) into a set of second order differential equation for the displacement components @xmath63 only . switching from time to frequency space via fourier transformation",

    "the specifics of the stress tensor , which depend on @xmath56 and the viscosity tensor , will be stated for the individual phases as we proceed .      when the frank director is included as a dynamical variable",

    "@xmath67  @xcite .",
    "then , eq .  ( [ genharvard ] ) leads to the equations of motion    [ genstruct ] @xmath68    the properties of the tensor @xmath69 are dictated by three constraints : first , the magnitude of the director has to be conserved , i.e. , @xmath70 implying @xmath71 ; second , the equations of motion must be invariant under @xmath72 implying @xmath69 must change sign with @xmath4 ; and third , under rigid uniform rotations , the director has to obey @xmath73 .",
    "the constrains imply that @xmath69 is of the form @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the projector on the subspace perpendicular to @xmath4 .",
    "there are no constraints on the value of @xmath76 . the second term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eoma ] ) is a dissipative term that describes diffusive relaxation of the director .",
    "its coefficient @xmath77 has the dimensions of an inverse viscosity . as before , there are no dissipative contributions to eq .",
    "( [ eomb ] ) because liquid crystal elastomers are tethered .",
    "there is no dissipative contribution to eq .",

    "any such terms must be of the form @xmath81 , and it is impossible to construct a tensor @xmath82 that satisfying the symmetries of the system and making @xmath81 odd under @xmath80 .",
    "a similar argument rules out a dissipative contribution to eq .",
    "( [ eomb ] ) that involves @xmath83 . as before",
    ", galileian invariance demands that the dissipative coupling of @xmath58 to @xmath59 are of the form @xmath84 .",
    "here we use the notation @xmath85 instead of @xmath61 for the viscosity tensor , so that we can cleanly keep track of differences between purely hydrodynamical theories and theories with strain and director . in general",
    ", we will assume that @xmath77 and the @xmath85 are , like the @xmath61 , independent of frequency .",
    "[ smcrheology ] , where we discuss the behavior of sm@xmath1 elastomers in rheology experiments , however , we will refrain from this simplifying assumption and we will replace the constants @xmath77 and the @xmath85 by phenomenological functions @xmath86 and @xmath87 of frequency .",
    "macroscopically , sm@xmath0 elastomers have uniaxial symmetry . when they are crosslinked , as we assume , in the sm@xmath0 phase , the uniaxial symmetry is not spontaneous but rather permanently imprinted and the material can not possess soft elasticity . in the small deformation limit , these elastomers are macroscopically simply uniaxial rubbers ( albeit with a very large value of the modulus @xmath88 for extension or compression along the layer normal ) . as such ,",
    "their hydrodynamics is identical to that of uniaxial solids  @xcite beyond the hydrodynamic regime , however , one must expect an influence of the director on the dynamics of sm@xmath0 elastomers in which the genuine difference between sm@xmath0 and conventional uniaxial elastomers shows up . here",
    "we apply our dynamical equations with displacement and director to the sm@xmath0 phase in order to study these effects .      as alluded to above , sm@xmath0 elastomers are macroscopically simply uniaxial rubbers , at least when strains are small . therefore , the harmonic stretching elastic energy density @xmath89 of a sm@xmath0 elastomer has exactly the same form as that of a uniaxial solid  @xcite : @xmath90 we omit higher order terms in the strain because they are inconsequential for our linearized dynamical equations .",
    "we have chosen the coordinate system so that the @xmath54-axis lies in the uniaxial direction . here and in the following , indices from the beginning of the alphabet , @xmath91 ,",
    "take on the values 1 and 2 .",
    "the @xmath92 are components of the cauchy - saint - venant @xcite strain tensor @xmath93 ,    [ defstrain ] @xmath94    where @xmath95 are components of the cauchy deformation tensor @xmath96 . in eq .",
    "( [ defstrainb ] ) we have dropped the nonlinear part of the strain tensor , because , for our purposes , it is sufficient to work to harmonic order .    for setting up a dynamical theory for sm@xmath0 elastomers that goes beyond the hydrodynamic limit ,",
    "we need a more detailed level of description that explicitly involves the frank director @xmath4 .",
    "when @xmath4 is included , the overall elastic energy density @xmath56 will have the following contributions : @xmath97 with @xmath89 as given in eq .",
    "( [ uniax ] ) .",
    "@xmath98 is a tilt energy density that accounts for the energy cost when the director , which in an equilibrium sm@xmath0 elastomer is aligned along the normal @xmath99 of the smectic layers , tilts away from @xmath99 .",
    "@xmath100 is the density of the usual frank energy that describes deviations from the homogeneous equilibrium orientation of the mesogenic component .",
    "@xmath101 finally is the energy density of coupling between strain and director distortions .",
    "coupling the strain and the director brings about an intricate conceptual problem : whereas the liquid crystalline fields @xmath99 and @xmath4 transform as ( rank 1 ) tensors in target space and are scalars with respect to rotations in reference space , the strain tensor @xmath93 is a ( rank 2 ) tensor in reference space , and it is a scalar in target space .",
    "thus , in order to construct meaningful combinations of @xmath93 and the liquid crystalline fields , we have to de able to represent these quantities in either space .",
    "the matrix polar decomposition theorem  @xcite provides a route to this representation .",
    "it allows us convert ( or rotate ) any reference space vector @xmath102 to a target space vector @xmath103 via @xmath104 and a target - space vector to a reference space vector via @xmath105 with the ration matrix @xmath106 given by @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the unit matrix and where @xmath109 is the antisymmetric part of the displacement gradient tensor @xmath110 defined by @xmath111 .",
    "in particular , we can rotate the target space director @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the so - called c - director , to a reference space vector @xmath114 , and rotate the unit vector @xmath115 specifying the direction of the uniaxial axis in the reference space to a target - space unit vector .    with the use of the polar decomposition technique , it is not difficult to formulate the tilt and the coupling energy in reference space variables .",
    "as mentioned above , in the equilibrium sm@xmath0 phase , the director prefers to be parallel to both the layer normal @xmath99 and the anisotropy axis @xmath116  @xcite , which are parallel to each other .",
    "there are energy costs proportional to @xmath117 and @xmath118 associated with deviations from this equilibrium .",
    "these combine to yield a contribution to the tilt energy proportional to @xmath119 and higher order terms that are unimportant here .",
    "therefore , the leading contribution to the tilt energy density is @xmath120 where @xmath121 . at harmonic order ,",
    "there is only one contribution to the coupling energy that is compatible with the uniaxial symmetry , viz .",
    "@xmath122 ( the symbols @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 are usually reserved for third - order couplings that , however , do not matter here ) . when @xmath98 and @xmath101 are combined , the result is identical in form to the harmonic coupling energy density @xmath126 appearing in the elastic energy density @xmath127 for a nematic elastomer , when the latter is described in terms of strains and the frank director  @xcite . the stretching energy density @xmath89 and the frank energy density @xmath100 in eq .",
    "( [ nematicenergy ] ) are the same as in eq .",
    "( [ fullenergy ] ) , albeit with the elastic constant having , in general , different values .",
    "moreover , @xmath128 and @xmath129 will be different from @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "in nematic elastomers , the values of @xmath130 and @xmath131 are such that the shear modulus @xmath132 is renormalized by director relaxation to a value @xmath133 that is zero for an ideally soft nematic elastomer or nearly so for a non - ideal semi - soft nematic elastomer .",
    "the corresponding renormalized shear modulus @xmath134 of a sm@xmath0 elastomer , to the contrary , will always be significantly larger than zero , when the elastomer was crosslinked , as we assume , in the sm@xmath0 phase .",
    "inserting the just discussed elastic energy of sm@xmath0 elastomers into the equations of motion with displacement and director , eq .",
    "( [ genstruct ] ) , we obtain dynamical equations for sm@xmath0 s that are identical in form to those of nematic elastomers .",
    "the only differences reside in the magnitude of the elastic constants , viscosities and nonhydrodynamic relaxation times .",
    "in addition , @xmath135 can vanish in soft nematics but @xmath136 is always significantly larger than zero in sm@xmath0 elastomers crosslinked in the sm@xmath0 phase .",
    "thus , solving the sm@xmath0 equations leads to sound velocities , modes etc .",
    "that have exactly the same from as in nematics . to avoid undue repetition ,",

    "for example , nematic and sm@xmath0 elastomers possess 3 pairs of hydrodynamic sound modes .",
    "one of the qualitative differences is , that a soft nematic elastomer , where @xmath391 , has two pairs of sound modes whose sound velocity vanishes in the softness related symmetry directions , whereas for a sm@xmath0 elastomers , where @xmath390 is significantly larger than zero , sound velocities are non - vanishing in all directions .",
    "the other qualitative difference is that nematic elastomers exhibit dynamic ( semi-)soft elasticity , i.e. , the generalization of ( semi-)soft elasticity to non - zero frequencies .",
    "sm@xmath0 elastomers crosslinked in the sm@xmath0 phase , since they are not soft or semi - soft , can not have this property .",
    "biaxial smectic and sm@xmath1 elastomers possess , like nematic and sm@xmath0 elastomers , three pairs of hydrodynamic sound modes .",
    "one of the sound - mode pairs in either elastomer is associated with soft deformations .",

    "the remaining two sound sound mode pairs are associated with non - soft deformations .",
    "their velocities remain finite in the directions in which the velocities of the softness - related modes vanishes . in the incompressible limit ,",
    "these mode pairs become purely transverse and longitudinal , and hence the latter are effectively suppressed .",
    "the vanishing of the velocities of the softness - related modes in certain directions could be exploited , in principle , to separate these modes from the remaining modes , which have different transverse polarizations than the softness - related modes .",
    "therefore , at least theoretically , soft biaxial smectic and sm@xmath1 elastomers could be used to polarize acoustic waves .",
    "our theory with strain and director reveals that sm@xmath1 elastomers may have an unconventional behavior in rheology experiments .",
    "it predicts that , as in nematic and sm@xmath0 elastomers , certain storage and loss moduli may show , respectively , a plateau and an associated dip in the frequency range @xmath392 .",
    "it also predicts that soft samples of these materials exhibit dynamic soft elasticity .",
    "recently there has been a controversy whether this unconventional rheology and dynamic soft elasticity can be observed in liquid crystal elastomers or not .",
    "thus far , this controversy revolved around nematic elastomers .",
    "the few samples of nematic elastomers on which rheology measurements have been performed , produced little evidence for unconventional rheology or dynamic soft elasticity .",
    "however , due to the limited amount of data that is currently available and due to differences in their interpretation , the experimental picture still gives reason for debate ; both phenomena are neither clearly verified nor clearly ruled out .",
    "the idea to use sm@xmath1 elastomers as an alternative testing ground for these phenomena seems appealing .",
    "as far as dynamic soft or semi - soft elasticity is concerend , however , it will be difficult if not impossible to realize soft or semi - soft oszillatory shears experimentally , because one has to use a very specific , temperature - dependent coordinate system . regarding the plateau and the dip in , respectively , the storage and loss moduli , these are less likely to exist physically in smectics than in nematics , because the director relaxation time in smectic elastomers is probably shorter than in nematic elastomers .    despite these difficulties ,",
