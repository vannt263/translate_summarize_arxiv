    "observations in the 21 cm hi line reveal the presence of discrete clouds of neutral hydrogen at high galactic latitudes ( e.g. hartmann & burton 1997 ) .",
    "these clouds , whose velocities can not be explained by differential galactic rotation , are generally grouped into velocity subsets based on their radial velocities relative to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) . historically , the clouds with @xmath2 @xmath3 70 are labeled high - velocity clouds ( hvcs ) and those with @xmath2 @xmath4 70 are termed intermediate - velocity clouds ( ivcs ) . recent indications from both dust surveys and distance estimates suggest that the two classes are indeed distinct populations ( burton 1996 )",
    ".    the distances to the clouds are necessary to constrain the most significant physical parameters , such as mass , size , density and pressure . without distance information ,",
    "the origins of these clouds remains speculative .",
    "numerous origin scenarios have been proposed , including local - group infall from the intergalactic medium ( blitz 1998 ) , products of thermal instabilities acting at large scale heights in the galactic halo , and cooled infalling gas which was ejected into the halo from energetic disk events ( see review by wakker & van woerden 1997 ) .",
    "it is essential to determine the cloud distances in order to distinguish between such scenarios .",
    "cloud distances are also fundamental to understanding the soft x - ray background ( sxrb ) .",
    "for example , sxrb measurements in the direction of the draco cloud show a reduction of @xmath5 50% in the 0.25  kev emission over the cloud relative to the adjacent sky ( burrows & mendenhall 1991 ; snowden 1991 ) .",
    "this depression is consistent with photoelectric absorption of the sxrb emission by the cloud .",
    "the nature of the sxrb is uncertain .",
    "one model suggests that most of the sxrb arises from local low - density plasma ( saunders 1977 ) . this local hot bubble ( lhb )",
    "has a temperature of @xmath6  k and extends for a few hundred parsecs .",
    "other models propose that the majority of the sxrb emission originates at large distances in the galactic halo ( e.g. marshall and clark 1984 ) .",
    "again , in order to distinguish between models , it is essential to determine the distances to the shadowing clouds .    the draco cloud ( @xmath7=90@xmath8.0 , b=38@xmath8.8 ) is the best studied of the high - latitude ivcs ( e.g. lilienthal 1991 and references therein ) , but its distance is still uncertain .",
    "two different upper distance limits have been suggested by : 1 ) star count measurements ( rohlfs 1986 : 2000  pc ) and 2 ) differential star count measurements ( wennmacher 1988 : 1500  pc ) .",
    "three different lower distance limits have been suggested by : 1 ) @xmath9 photometry ( goerigk & mebold 1986 : 800  pc ) , 2 ) star count measurements ( mebold 1985 : 800  pc ) and 3 ) interstellar absorption - line measurements ( lilienthal 1991 : 300  pc ) .",
    "notably , the limits from star count data and @xmath9 photometry may require significant revision , as recent work by stark ( 1997 ) indicates that the extinction due to the draco cloud may have been overestimated by a factor of four or more .",
    "of all methods used , the most promising is interstellar absorption line measurements , both in terms of the potential accuracy of the derived distance , and the insensitivity to systematic errors ( wakker & van woerden 1997 ) .    in this letter ,",
    "we derive a distance to the draco cloud using the interstellar absorption - line technique .",
    "this distance estimate is based on moderate - resolution spectra at the sodium doublet of four stars in the line of sight to this cloud .",
    "one star clearly displays interstellar absorption at the systemic velocity of the draco cloud and is thus behind it .",
    "the three other stars show no interstellar absorption , and are thus in front of it . from spectral classifications ,",
    "we deduce a distance to each star , and hence bracket the cloud distance .",
    "this represents the first measurement of the distance to the draco cloud where both firm upper and lower limits can be given . in",
    "2 we describe the target selection process , observations and data reduction . in  3 we demonstrate the interstellar absorption in the background star , and the lack of interstellar absorption in the foreground stars .",
    "the distance to the draco cloud is derived in  4 .",
    "numerous stars along the line - of - sight towards the draco cloud were observed at the sodium doublet ( 5889.953   & 5895.923  ) from may to september , 1997 , and in february 1998 , using the david dunlap observatory ( ddo ) 1.88 m telescope + cassegrain spectrograph .",
    "the setup used provided a dispersion of 0.200  / pixel , a spectral range of @xmath10  , with a resolution of 0.43  .",
    "this resolution , equivalent to 22 at the wavelength of the sodium doublet , is sufficient to detect the sharp lines attributable to individual hi clouds ( wakker & van woerden 1997 ) .",
    "the target stars were selected primarily from the tycho catalog ( hog 1997 ) , the deepest available general catalog of stars with accurate @xmath11 colors .",
    "we selected stars which are blue ( @xmath12 ) , and relatively faint ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "such stars are likely to be distant early - type stars , which provide relatively clean continuum emission in the spectral region of interest , and are thus useful as probes for interstellar absorption .",
    "the bulk of the observing time was allocated to stars which clearly lay along the line of sight to the draco cloud as defined by it s",
    "iras @xmath14 emission at 100@xmath15 m ( figure 1 ) .",
    "this dust should trace the highest column density regions of the cloud ( burton 1996 ) .",
    "we expect such stars to show a relatively strong sodium absorption feature ( if behind the cloud ) , easily detected as unresolved lines in moderate resolution spectra .",
    "this selection technique is in contrast to previous work on other ivcs ( _ e.g. _ benjamin 1996 ) , where targets were defined on the basis of the more extended hi emission , and showed a correspondingly weaker sodium absorption .    a total of eight stars were observed toward the draco cloud , with typical total integration times ranging from 2400 - 5400 seconds .",
    "telluric standards were repeatedly observed at regular intervals .",
    "of the six standards observed , only hd177724 and hd120315 were eventually used , as the other standards showed contamination by interstellar sodium absorption at low velocities .",
    "the target star observations are detailed in table 1 .",
    "one star ( bd+64 1134 ) was extensively re - observed in february 1998 , as the original 1997 spectra showed a potential , albeit weak , sodium absorption feature at the draco cloud s systemic velocity ; this feature was not present in the final co - added spectrum .",
    "the spectra were pre - processed and extracted to using standard iraf tasks .",
    "great care was taken to ensure the correct removal of prominent sodium sky lines engendered by the ddo s close proximity to a major urban center .",
    "the individual spectra for each target star were then summed after velocity correction to the lsr rest frame . in the following analysis , we concentrate on the four most distant stars ( based on color ) ; we also list the four closer stars in table 1 for completeness .",
    "the spectra for the four most distant stars are shown in figure 2 .",
    "one of these stars ( tyc  4194  2188 ) @xmath16 shows an _ unresolved _ absorption feature at the draco cloud s systemic velocity ( @xmath17=23.9  ; heiles , reach & koo 1988 ) , and is thus behind the cloud . to quantify the nature of the other strong sodium absorption features apparent in the spectra ,",
    "we have cross - correlated the _",
    "remaining _ wavelength portions of the spectra with an appropriate spectral standard ( hd173667 ) .",
    "the cross - correlations show maxima which have velocities and widths consistent with all other significant sodium absorption features , indicating that these features are likely stellar in origin .",
    "the lsr velocities of these stellar features are listed in table 2 .",
    "furthermore , we have used the observed interstellar absorption in tyc  4194  2188 ( equivalent width @xmath18 0.25   ) to compute the expected interstellar absorption in the other three stars , presuming that these stars are also behind the draco cloud .",
    "this putative absorption has been scaled by the relative total hi column density ( due to the draco cloud ) at each star compared to that at tyc  4194  2188 , derived from the leiden / dwingeloo hi survey ( hartmann & burton 1997 ) .",
    "the expected absorption is shown in figure 2 . since their observed spectra",
    "do not show the expected absorption , we claim that the other three stars are in front of the draco cloud .",
    "note that this assumes that the nai@xmath19hi ratio remains constant across the cloud , and that changes in the hi column density at angular scales less than @xmath50.5 degrees do not significantly affect our conclusions .",
    "to determine the distance to this subset of four stars , high s / n ` classification ' spectra were acquired , again using the ddo  1.88 m telescope + cassegrain spectrograph .",
    "the spectra cover roughly 3750 - 4350   .",
    "a suite of standards ( from garcia 1989 ) were also observed , ranging in spectral type from b0 to g5 , and spanning luminosity classes i - v .",
    "the four stars with classification spectra have been classified by comparison to the observed set of spectral standards . the derived spectral class and the absolute magnitude calibration of corbally & ( 1984 )",
    "were then used to assign an absolute magnitude , and hence distance , to each star ( see table 2 ) .",
    "we have considered three independent sources of error in this distance estimate : 1 ) the error in the tycho @xmath20 magnitude ; 2 ) an assumed classification error of @xmath21 one spectral class for each star ; 3 ) the intrinsic dispersion ( 0.7  mag ) in the absolute magnitude relation vs. mk spectral class ( jaschek & gmez 1998 ) .",
    "the dominant uncertainty is the intrinsic scatter in the m@xmath22-mk relation .",
    "we have not accounted for extinction , as the expected overall extinction along typical lines of sight at these galactic latitudes is small .",
    "additionally , the extinction on the background star due to the draco cloud is uncertain , but likely quite small ( stark 1997 ) .",
    "note that the inclusion of extinction can only _ reduce _ the estimated distance of the background star , and hence tighten the distance bracket .",
    "_ individual stars _    _ tyc  4194  2188 : _ this star , the only one of our sample with detected interstellar sodium absorption due to the draco cloud , is also obviously of the earliest spectral type .",
    "the best spectral class estimate is a6v , which places it at a distance of @xmath5620  pc._bd+64  1134 : _ this star is an f5 main - sequence dwarf . though it is quite distant ( @xmath5380  pc ) , the weak expected sodium absorption ( figure 2 ) makes it a poor lower limit , despite the relatively high s / n of the sodium spectrum._tyc  4190  1263 : _ this star is a spectroscopic binary as it shows double stellar lines in the sodium spectral region .",
    "the flux ratio of the components is @xmath52 - 3 , and the best composite spectral classification is an f5/g0 main - sequence dwarf pair . in determining the distance to this star , we have allowed a spectral mis - classification of @xmath211 class for the primary component and @xmath212 classes for the secondary .",
    "this star provides the best lower limit on the draco cloud as it is relatively distant ( @xmath5460  pc ) , and would be expected to readily show sodium absorption if it were behind the cloud ( see figure 2)._tyc  4193  691 : _ this star is about g0 , and likely a main - sequence dwarf .",
    "the angular separation between it and the background star is quite small , but it is too nearby ( @xmath5250  pc ) to provide a useful lower distance limit .    the derived distances are summarized in table  2 . the background star ( tyc  4194  2188 ) and the most distant foreground star ( tyc  4190  1263 ) set constraints on the distance to the draco cloud .",
    "this bracket is 463@xmath0 to 618@xmath1  pc , which corresponds to a vertical distance above the galactic plane of @xmath23 to @xmath24  pc .",
    "this is in excellent overall agreement with the much broader distance limits set by other methods ( see  1 ) .",
    "we have observed a total of 8 stars in the line of sight towards the draco cloud and detected the cloud in absorption at the sodium doublet toward one star .",
    "detailed spectral classifications of this star and the three most distant foreground stars provide a distance bracket of 463@xmath0 to 618@xmath1  pc .",
    "this distance is consistent with , but much more precise than , other previous measures by different means .",
    "furthermore , this distance indicates that the draco cloud is located outside the local hot bubble and therefore must be shadowing x - ray emission from beyond the lhb .",
