    "in contrast to @xmath98 , @xmath105 grows with increasing magnetic field at intermediate temperatures . for illustration ,",
    "@xmath105 is plotted versus @xmath212 at @xmath211 in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] for the same choice of parameters as in the main panel .",
    "it exhibits a maximum at large fields , which increases and its position approaches @xmath27 when the temperature is lowered .",
    "thus , indications of the transition to the ferromagnetic phase are visible in @xmath105 , but not present in @xmath98 .",
    "note , however , that all three curves in the main panel of fig .  [ fig:3 ] almost pass through the same point for @xmath213 .",
    "for @xmath214 , @xmath105 is enhanced by the magnetic field and we can therefore conclude that the decrease of @xmath98 as a function of magnetic field is due to a cancellation of @xmath105 and the magnetothermal correction in eq .",

    "the curve for @xmath77 is also included in the figure ; this one , however , is exact in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "below @xmath217 , the curves lie on top of each other .",
    "small deviations at lowest temperatures visible in the plot can be ascribed to the presence of finite - size gaps .",

    "[ sec:3 ] that eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mf7 ] ) and ( [ eq : mf9 ] ) hold for arbitrary @xmath199 and further numerical data ( not included in the figure ) show that it is also correct for @xmath218",

    "( [ eq:21 ] ) for the spin drude weight @xmath219 introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] . here , we want to discuss to which extent the inequality eq .",
    "( [ eq:21 ] ) is exhausted by @xmath78 at finite magnetic fields and finite temperatures . an analogous analysis in the limit of @xmath220",
    "can be found in ref .  .",
    "to this end we compare @xmath201 and @xmath221 in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] .",
    "note that first , the relation @xmath222 is equivalent to the positivity of the thermal drude weight @xmath223 .",
    "second , @xmath224 implies a very small thermal drude weight and thus , the comparison provided in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] also reveals the relative size of the two contributions to @xmath98 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : k5a ] ) , namely @xmath105 and the magnetothermal correction @xmath225 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , results are shown for @xmath125 , @xmath207 sites , and @xmath226 .",
    "for the sake of clarity , data for smaller system sizes are not included in the figure . differences between the curves for @xmath183 and @xmath207 are anyway only pronounced for temperatures @xmath227 and become smaller as the magnetic field @xmath2 increases .",
    "+ figure [ fig:5 ] allows for three major observations : ( i ) @xmath228 at low temperatures and for all cases shown in the figure ; ( ii ) @xmath229 approximates @xmath203 the better the larger the magnetic field is ; ( iii ) significant deviations are present for high temperatures implying that for a quantitative description of @xmath104 using eq .",
    "( [ eq:21 ] ) , more conserved quantities need to be considered in eq .",
    "( [ eq:21 ] ) .",
    "+    our comparison provides , at least for finite system sizes , a quantitative measure of the temperature range where @xmath230 .",
    "point ( i ) indicates that analytical approaches can make use of @xmath229 for a quantitative description of @xmath104 at low temperatures as it has been done by fujimoto and kawakami within a continuum theory in ref .  .",
    "the quantities that appear on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq:22 ] ) are less involved than eqs .",
    "( [ eq : k3 ] ) and ( [ eq : k8 ] ) for @xmath104 , as the former are static correlators . furthermore , for finite magnetic fields",
    ", we suggest to compute @xmath104 analytically from eq .",
    "( [ eq:21 ] ) , taking into account some of the conserved quantities @xmath231 , which are in principle known ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "such a procedure is applicable to @xmath84 and might circumvent the ambiguities in the results encountered in recent computations of @xmath232 ( refs .  ) .",
    "the latter have used eq .",
    "( [ eq : k8 ] ) directly or kohn s formula@xcite , equivalently .",
    "regarding the relative size of @xmath105 and the magnetothermal correction , we see that the latter becomes more relevant the larger the magnetic field is which leads to the strong suppression of @xmath98 .",
    "this is consistent with results of the previous sections of this paper .",
    "in this paper we have studied the thermal drude weight of the @xmath1 model with exchange anisotropy @xmath199 in finite magnetic fields using mean - field theory and exact diagonalization .",
    "magnetothermal effects have been taken into account and the condition of zero magnetization current flow has been applied .",
    "let us now summarize the main findings and relate them to experiments .",
    "+ we have discussed the low - temperature limit of the thermal drude weight @xmath98 and we have given arguments that it changes from an algebraic behavior for @xmath233 to an exponentially activated behavior in the polarized state for @xmath206 .",
    "in addition , the leading term at low temperatures along the critical line @xmath234 , is universally given by @xmath235 , where the prefactor @xmath236 , given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mf7 ] ) and ( [ eq : mf9 ] ) , is independent of @xmath7 . in the gapless phase ,",
    "the leading contribution to @xmath98 is linear in the temperature with a field- and anisotropy dependent prefactor . in consequence",
    ", the thermal drude weight @xmath98 can be expected to be proportional to the specific heat in the gapless state in the low - temperature limit , where the velocity of elementary excitations is constant .",
    "+ further , the drude weight is suppressed by the magnetic field , which can be ascribed to the increase of the magnetothermal correction relative to the pure thermal drude weight @xmath105 . as a third result , the position of the maximum of @xmath98 depends non - monotonically on the magnetic field . while in the present paper , we have focused on the thermal drude weight @xmath10 under the condition of zero spin - current flow , our analysis of the full transport matrix eq .",
    "( [ eq : k0 ] ) can easily be extended to a variety of other transport situations , which would be characterized by different combinations of the drude weights .",
    "+ turning now to experiments , we emphasize that for a description of realistic materials external scattering has to be accounted for . in a simple picture",
    ", one may expect the drude peak to be broadened by external scattering mechanisms .",
    "the behavior in magnetic fields that one may observe in experiments will likely depend both on external scattering rates as well as on the thermal drude weight .",
    "nevertheless , one may speculate that qualitative trends of the field dependence of the thermal drude weight are reflected in thermal transport experiments .",
    "+ in recent experiments on quasi one - dimensional magnetic materials@xcite , the thermal conductivity has often been found to be insensitive to the application of an external magnetic field .",
    "this is , however , explained by the large absolute value of the exchange coupling in these materials , being typically of the order of magnitude of @xmath237 k. it would therefore be desirable to perform measurements on materials with a moderately small exchange coupling to check our results . still , it might be very difficult to reach the saturation field @xmath144 in realistic materials , but at least the qualitative features like the suppression of the thermal conductivity or a shift of the maximum could be verified . in particular , experiments in relatively large magnetic fields",
    "may provide an indirect probe of spin currents in one - dimensional quantum magnets , which have so far not yet been observed directly in experiments .",
    "conclusions about the low - temperature limit would require reliable methods to separate the magnetic contribution from the phonon part , which is a challenging task in the interpretation of experiments . nevertheless , we believe that further experiments on the field dependence of the thermal conductivity could hint at the nature and mechanisms of magnetic transport properties .",
