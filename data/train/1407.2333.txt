    "multi - wavelength observations of @xmath11-ray bursts ( grbs ) during the _ swift _ era have unambiguously confirmed these events to be the most luminous and distant transients in the universe @xcite .",
    "a key objective of the _ swift _ mission was to obtain an accurate determination of the grb luminosity function ( lf ) through the accumulation of redshift measurements @xcite .",
    "although _ swift _ has obtained over 200 redshifts , for long duration @xmath11-ray bursts ( lgrbs ) , the data is still insufficient to determine the lf accurately ; additionally , the redshift distribution has been plagued by various selection effects .",
    "these biases must be fully understood to gain an accurate representation of the intrinsic lf .    to circumvent these obstacles ,",
    "many authors have chosen to employ the more abundant high energy data i.e. the brightness distribution of bursts @xcite .",
    "the brightness distribution or log@xmath0log@xmath1 distribution is a convolution of the source rate evolution and the intrinsic lf .",
    "although this method is sensitive to the form of the lf , an obstacle often encountered is that mixing of the lf and rate evolution can introduce a degeneracy @xcite",
    ". this can be further complicated if one considers additional factors such as redshift evolution of the cosmic metallicity dependence or an evolving lf .    in this study",
    "we demonstrate a novel approach to this problem by complementing a standard log@xmath0log@xmath1 analysis with two observation - time relations : firstly , a new peak luminosity  observation - time relation ( log@xmath5log@xmath4 ) will be used to scrutinise the estimated parameters of a log@xmath0log@xmath1 distribution .",
    "secondly , a redshift  observation time relation ( log@xmath3log@xmath4 ) will be used to confirm limits on the range of possible values of the local rate density of lgrbs ( without correction for beaming ) obtained through a @xmath2 estimation .",
    "an important part of our analysis will be an accurate representation of the _ swift _ triggering threshold . to do this",
    "we use recent results from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; l14 hereafter ) to produce functions which are used to approximate the efficiency of _ swift _ triggering and the probability of observing a burst at a given redshift .",
    "we will show that these methods can provide both useful constraints on the lf of lgrbs . to perform our analysis",
    ", we will construct a sample of 175 bursts with redshifts confirmed through absorbtion spectroscopy and photometry and luminosity estimates calculated and corrected using the spectral parameters of @xcite .",
    "the whole catalogue will also be made available online .",
    "the paper will be organised as follows : in section [ section_time_dimension ] we will introduce the concept of using the observation time dependence of transients and will briefly describe some of the works which have successfully exploited this parameter . in section [ section_swift_detection efficiency ]",
    "we will discuss the results of l14 and present the efficiency functions that will be used in the analysis . in section [ section_theoretical_framework ] , we will set the theoretical framework for this study .    in section [ section_logllogt_theory ] a new log @xmath5log @xmath4 relation will be derived and in section [ section_logzlogt_theory ] we will describe the log @xmath3log @xmath4 relation .",
    "section [ the logllogt relation ] will describe how the log @xmath5log @xmath4 relation can indicate the form of the lf . after describing our data sample in section [ section_lgrb_data_sample ]",
    "we will introduce the data extraction methods used for the observation time relations in section [ section_data_extraction ] .",
    "we will determine an estimate of the local rate density of lgrbs in section [ section_rate_results ] , after which we will probe the most likely parameters of the lf in section [ section_lf_results ] .",

    "@xcite illustrated how the time - record of grb observations could be used as a tool to untangle different grb populations .",
    "they did this by considering the _ rarest _ events in a population i.e. those events from the tail of the distribution which occur at low-@xmath3 or have exceptional brightness in comparison with the average .",
    "the methodology is based on the use of extreme value statistics @xcite and follows the study of @xcite who showed that these rare events impose a unique rate dependent statistical signature that can be described by the ` probability event horizon ' ( peh ) concept . by recording successively rarer events as a function of observation - time , a data set  termed _",
    "peh data _  can be produced and constrained by a rate dependent model for peak flux ",
    "log@xmath1log@xmath4 @xcite or redshift ",
    "log@xmath3log@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "+    the basic concept is illustrated in figure [ figure_swift_logplogt_data ] which shows the _ swift _ lgrb peak flux data plotted up to june 2013 against observation - time . using a log - log plot it is apparent that successively brighter events have an observation - time dependence  the longer you observe , the greater the probability of observing an exceptionally bright event such as grb 130427a .",
    "successively brighter events are indicated by diamonds ",
    "these are the peh data .",
    "the figure shows how peh data is constrained using the euclidean and cosmological log@xmath1log@xmath4 models of @xcite .",
    "one should note that the data is not always as well behaved  for example , there is always a possibility of a bright event occurring early in a time series",
    ". therefore data extraction methods , which will be discussed later in section [ section_data_extraction ] , are employed to gain an optimal data set .    adopting a time dependence",
    "allows the method to be used as a tool to predict the likelihood of future events .",
    "this is clearly illustrated in figure [ figure_swift_logplogt_data ] .",
    "the vertical dashed line indicates the year 2007 when this relation was first published in @xcite using a smaller sample of _ swift _ bursts .",
    "we see that since this initial result two additional bursts consistent with the prediction have been added to the peh sample .",
    "these include the recent bright burst grb 130427a @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will show that the log@xmath3log@xmath4 relation can complement the more frequently used number count relations . as shown in @xcite , as peh events approach the local low-@xmath3 regime rapidly , the grb selection function @xcite and high-@xmath3 selection effects such as the ` redshift desert ' @xcite have a negligible effect .",
    "therefore , observation time relations can be used as a test of parameter compatibility without consideration of selection biases . to examine the lf of lgrbs , section [ section_logllogt_theory ]",
    "will extend previous studies by introducing a new cosmological log@xmath5log@xmath4 relation .",
    "in this study we use an alternative approach based on the recent comprehensive study of l14 , who have mimicked the 674 criteria of the _ swift _ triggering algorithm through a monte carlo approach .",
    "this included monitoring increased count rates on different timescales , energy bands and regions of the focal plane , periods of foreground ( periods of strong emission ) and background periods . using bat",
    "detected grb light curves with redshifts , a mock rest frame sample was created and converted to photon counts corresponding to different incidence angles . through a simulation of 50000 bursts ,",
    "a detailed comparison of the triggered sample with the observed _ swift _ distributions enabled both a thorough interrogation of the _ swift _ detector response and a determination of the global parameters of the lgrb population .    to produce a set of efficiency functions for the _ swift _ instrument we make use of the resulting l14 distributions ( simulated and detected ) in peak flux and redshift .",
    "this is a different approach to other studies which have determined similar functions based solely on the _ swift _ detected distributions @xcite or have used a simple scaling criteria @xcite .",
    "the adoption of these efficiency functions is important in this study .",
    "for example , the determination of a local rate density using the @xmath2 method ( see later section [ section_rate_results ] ) uses only a small sample of the closest occurring bursts  in this scenario , the flux threshold of the detector has a highly significant bearing on the final estimate . the remainder of this section will present and describe the analytical forms of these functions .      figure [ figure_swiwt sim_sample ] shows the simulated and triggered peak flux sample of l14 . the triggered sample is produced through a comprehensive reproduction of the _ swift _ triggering algorithm . although the simulated data was produced using a specific set of model parameters , we note the broad simulated distribution of peak fluxes ( 50,000 ) samples the detection response across a significantly wider range of values than generally considered . in comparison to the other techniques to model the _ swift _ triggering algorithm , we suggest that the triggered sample ( obtained through careful modeling of all 674 criteria ) provides an adequate representation of the _ swift _ response for use in this study .    by scaling of the simulated peak flux and triggered distributions of l14 , we obtain the following trigger efficiency function : @xmath12     +     +      to model the efficiency as a function of redshift , _ z _ , we use the result of fig .",

    "one should also scale the rate with the average peak flux efficiency of 14% determined by l14 .",
    "+    we will apply these functions in our analysis of the _ swift _ data sample  it will be interesting to draw comparisons between the global parameters determined in this study with those determined through simulation of the _ swift _ response by l14 .",
    "an isotropic equivalent luminosity in the source frame ( erg s@xmath10 ) can be calculated from :    @xmath14    where @xmath1 is the energy flux ( erg s@xmath10 @xmath15 ) in the observed energy band @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the luminosity distance and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are correction terms to convert the observed flux in the detector band ( for _ swift _ this is 15150 kev ) to the rest frame band 1@xmath20 kev .",
    "the first of these correction terms is the bolometric correction @xmath19 which accounts for the differing fraction of gamma ray energy seen in the detector band @xcite :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the rest - frame photon spectrum ( ph cm@xmath10 kev@xmath10 ) multiplied by a factor of @xmath24 ( energy in kev ) as part of the conversion to energy units . the term @xmath18 the cosmological @xmath25-correction and given by :    @xmath26    rearranging and substituting for @xmath19 and @xmath18 in the above equation yields the familiar relation for energy flux@xmath15 ) . if using a peak photon flux ( phs@xmath10@xmath15 ) there is an additional factor of @xmath27 . ] :    @xmath28    for long duration grbs the function @xmath22 is typically modeled by a band function @xcite which we use with high and low energy spectral indices of -2.25 and -1 and a peak energy of 511 kev ( in the source frame ) . unless spectral forms and parameters are available ( such as those used in determining the luminosity corrections in section [ section_lgrb_data_sample ] ) we will assume these values .",
    "to model the lgrb luminosity function ( lf ) , we use a broken power law model ( bpl ) model which takes the form :    @xmath29    with , @xmath5 is the isotropic rest frame luminosity in the 1 - 10000kev energy range and @xmath30 a characteristic cutoff scaling that separates the two slopes @xmath31 and @xmath32 . the additional power law in comparison with single power law forms lf allows to examine the low and high luminosity parts of the distribution .",

    "we note that equation [ eq_integral_lum ] is dependent on an estimate of @xmath48 for the lower limit of the integral over the lf .",
    "as shown in section [ section_swift_detection efficiency ] it is difficult to model the _ swift _ detection efficiency through a single value of @xmath48 .",
    "we find however , that the log@xmath5log @xmath4 circumvents this obstacle through its dependence on the most luminous events .",
    "figure [ figure_lumpeh_intlum ] illustrates this property by comparing the functions @xmath56 ( top panel ) and log@xmath5log @xmath4 ( lower panel ) models for the same parameters but using different values of @xmath48 .",

    "as shown above , the log @xmath3log@xmath4 and log @xmath5log@xmath4 relations are derived seamlessly from standard integral distributions .",
    "thus , model parameters obtained by fitting to a differential brightness distribution should satisfy the two observation - time relations presented above ( equations [ eq_logllogt ] and [ eq_logzlogt ] ) .",
    "an advantage of this technique is that the peh sample in redshift space is predominantly from the closest events",

    "below , we discuss and provide physical interpretations for these changes :    * panel ( b ) shows that increasing / decreasing the value of the break luminosity ( @xmath67 ) produces a vertical increase / decrease of the log @xmath5log @xmath4 curves . a higher value of @xmath30 results in a greater probability of a bright event ; thus an increased probability of a more energetic event at early observation times . *",
    "panel ( c ) shows that increasing / descreasing the gradient of the low end slope through @xmath31 offsets the curves in the positive / negative horizontal direction .",
    "increasing @xmath31 produces a greater proportion of dimmer bursts - therefore , a lower probability and thus , an increased waiting time , for a high luminosity event .",
    "* panel ( d ) illustrates how increasing / descreasing the value of @xmath32 produces a gradient change .",
    "a flatter value of the bright - end slope produces a greater proportion of bright burst ; this corresponds with an increase in the gradient of the probability curves .",
    "the sensitivity of the log@xmath5log@xmath4 peh curves to the parameters ( @xmath30 @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) , means that estimates obtained through a brightness distribution ( log@xmath0log@xmath1 ) can be validated .",
    "in particular , employing this complementary method can help to untangle degeneracies that are encountered in using a log@xmath0log@xmath1 fit .",
    "before we conduct our analysis , in the next two sections we will describe the lgrb data sample and then discus how to extract a peh data set .",
    "in recent studies @xcite and @xcite have suggested that the @xmath68 division of short and long grbs based on the batse bimodial distribution @xcite is a detector dependent categorisation and therefore not appropriate for _ swift _ bursts .",

    "the values of @xmath64 we obtain are in support of recent estimates of @xcite , @xcite and l14 .",
    "in particular , the use of the peak flux efficiency function based on the work of l14 support this study . our results favour a steep value of @xmath32 as suggested by @xcite and l14 .",
    "compatible values of @xmath31 shown in table [ table_fits_lognlogp_bpl ] are in agreement with the work of @xcite who have shown that values of @xmath115 are fully consistent with the prediction of an internal shock model for @xmath11-ray emission @xcite .",
    "we note however that these values are slightly steeper than those obtained by l14 - this could be the result of a slight degeneracy between this parameter and @xmath64 which can both produce a vertical displacement .",
    "this suggests a lf with less free parameters could be beneficial to place additional constraints on the range of @xmath64 and will be considered in a future study .",
    "when using number count relations to probe the rate and lf dependence of lgrbs , one is confronted by a number of difficulties .",
    "firstly , poor modeling of the complex triggering criteria of the _ swift _ instrument can lead to large biases and poor estimates in parameters .",
    "secondly , a complex mixing of the lf and source rate evolution can lead to degeneracies .",
    "thirdly , for redshift dependent relations , the effect of high redshift selection biases can be difficult to quantify .    to confront the first of these obstacles we have used the results of a recent comprehensive study of the _ swift _ instrument by l14 to produce an efficiency function for peak flux .",
    "this removes the considerable uncertainty encountered by using a single value of flux to represent the triggering sensitivity limit of the detector .",
    "an additional efficiency function has been constructed in redshift space , again based on the results of l14 .    in their study , l14 determined the best range of global parameters able to reproduce the observed distribution , based on the sample of @xcite which comprised of 414 bursts . applying our alternative methodology to a larger sample of 644 lgrbs , our results are in good agreement .    to approach the degeneracy problem we used a suite of different methods .",
    "we have complemented more standard @xmath2 and log @xmath0log @xmath1 brightness distribution methods with two observation - time relations , log @xmath116log @xmath4 . to determine initial estimates of the intrinsic ( beaming uncorrected ) rate density of lgrbs",
    "we have used the @xmath2 method . to confront the small sample used in this method we have weighted the peak flux and redshift data using the corresponding efficiency functions . to verify this initial estimate",
    "we have constrained the log @xmath3log @xmath4 distribution .    to determine the most likely parameters of the lgrb lf we have complemented a standard log @xmath0log @xmath1 brightness distribution with a new log @xmath5log @xmath4 relation .",
    "we have used both these methods simultaneously in an iterative procedure around the range of rate values calculated using @xmath2 .",
    "our results support an event rate density at the high end of recent estimates and assuming a broken power law model for the lf , a steep high end slope .",
    "there are a number of advantages in using the observation time relations .",
    "the log @xmath5log @xmath4 method exploits only the brightest proportion of bursts which are less likely to be below the detection threshold .",
    "we have shown that this relation is sensitive to the form of the lf , particularly the bright end .",
    "for the log @xmath3log @xmath4 relation , as the method is dependent on only the rarest close events , high-@xmath3 biases do not effect the analysis .",
    "we have selected a broken power law lf model for this study for comparison with l14 and other recent studies that choose this form .",
    "we note that there is at present no preferred form of the lf with a number of studies choosing a power law model with an exponential cut - off @xcite or log - normal distribution in luminosity @xcite .",
    "one advantage of using one of the latter forms , which have one less free parameter than a broken power model , is to minimise the risk of degeneracy in the parameter estimations .",
    "our results suggest a small degeneracy between the rate density and the low end slope of the chosen lf .",
    "future studies should therefore extend the work presented here and adopt a number of functional forms . a bayesian approach would enable constraints set by the two observation time relations to be fed into the analysis as priors .",
    "another possibility would be to investigate the form of the rate evolution , particularly the high redshift end .    to avoid added complexity",
    ", this study has not considered an evolving lf .",
    "the log @xmath5log @xmath4 method could be used to probe changes in different redshift intervals .",
    "a particular advantage of this method is that a log @xmath5log @xmath4 distribution is dependent on only the brightest proportion of data ; the requirement of an adequate amount of data in each redshift interval could therefore be circumvented .",
    "an evolving lf can be modeled by modifying the break luminosity as @xmath117 with the value of @xmath118 generally in the range 12 . as illustrated in section [ the logllogt relation ] , an increase in @xmath30 would produce a vertical offset in the log @xmath5log @xmath4 90% peh bands .",
    "this merits further investigation with a range of lf models and will be presented in a forthcoming study .",
