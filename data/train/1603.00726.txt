    "whilst a variety of 3d imaging technologies are suited for different applications , time - of - flight ( tof ) systems have set the benchmark for performance with regards to a combination of accuracy and operating range .",
    "time - of - flight imaging is performed by illuminating a scene with a pulsed light source and observing the back - scattered light .",
    "correlating the detection time of the back - scattered light with the time of the illumination pulse allows the distance , @xmath2 , to objects within the scene to be estimated by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the tof and @xmath5 is the propagation speed of light .",
    "the transverse spatial resolution of the image obtained is retrieved either by using a pixelated array or by using a single - pixel detector with a scanning approach @xcite . in both cases , the inherent speed of light demands the use of detectors with a fast response time and high - speed electronic readout in order to obtain high precision depth resolution .",
    "advances in sensor development have enabled the first tof single - photon avalanche detector ( spad ) array cameras to enter the commercial , having a resolution of @xmath6 pixels , however such devices are still in their infancy @xcite . on contrary , there are mature single - pixel detectors in the market which provide stable time - resolved measurements , and by employing compressed sensing principles for image reconstruction , which takes advantage of the sparsity in natural scenes , the acquisition times of the scanning approach is largely reduced @xcite .",
    "recently there have been some interesting developments in 3d imaging utilising single - pixel detectors .",
    "one technique utilises structured illumination and spatially separated photodiodes to obtain multiple images with different shading properties from which 3d images can be reconstructed via photometric stereo @xcite .",
    "another scheme scans a scene , pixel by pixel , using a pulsed illumination source and measures the reflected light using an avalanche photodiode ( apd ) , whereupon the first detected photon is used to recover depth and reflectivity via tof @xcite .",
    "an alternative method for scanning a scene and recovering depth and reflectivity via tof has also been demonstrated utilising structured pulsed illumination @xcite .    among the mentioned demonstrations , many @xcite employed photon counting detection ( i.e. geiger - mode ) , which is well suited for low light level imaging . however , one limitation of photon counting detectors is the inherent electronic dead - time between successive measurements , often 10 s of nanoseconds , which prohibits the retrieval of short range timing information from a single illumination pulse .",
    "instead , an accurate temporal response from a 3d scene requires summing the data over many back - scattered photons and hence many illumination pulses ( usually several hundreds or thousands @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , as first demonstrated by kirmani @xcite , a high - speed photodiode can retrieve the temporal response from a single illumination pulse , which can be advantageous in certain circumstances , for instance when the reflected light intensity is comparatively large .",
    "incidentally , photon counting can not operate under such conditions since the detection will always be triggered by back - scattered photons from the nearest , or most reflective , object , rendering more distant objects invisible .    in this paper , we present a single - pixel 3d imaging system employing pulsed structured illumination and a high - speed ( short response time ) photodiode for sampling the time - varying intensity of the back - scattered light from a scene . we show that by using an analogue photodiode to record the full temporal form of the back - scattered light , along with our original 3d reconstruction algorithm , it is possible to recover surface profiles of objects with an accuracy much better than that implied by the finite temporal bandwidth of the detector and digitisation electronics . at distances of @xmath7",
    "we demonstrate a range profile accuracy of @xmath8 with image resolutions of @xmath9 pixels , whilst simultaneously recovering reflectivity information of the object .",
    "this accuracy is achieved despite a detection bandwidth and a digitisation interval corresponding to distances of @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively .",
    "we further demonstrate that by employing a compressive sampling scheme , the system is capable of performing continuous real - time 3d video with a frame - rate up to @xmath12 .",
    "the single - pixel 3d imaging system , illustrated in fig.[figure1 ] , consists of a pulsed laser and a digital - micro mirror - device ( dmd ) to provide time varying structured illumination .",
    "a high - speed photodiode is used in conjunction with a fresnel lens condenser system to measure the back - scattered intensity resulting from each pattern .",
    "the analogue photodiode output is passed through a low - noise amplifier and sampled using a high - speed digitiser . in our work we chose to use the hadamard matrices @xcite for providing structured illumination . in order to remove sources of noise , such as fluctuations in ambient light levels , we obtain differential signals by displaying each hadamard pattern , followed by its inverse pattern , and taking the difference in the measured intensities @xcite .",
    "detailed information about experimental setup is provided in methods .",
    "a 3d image of the scene is reconstructed utilising the time - varying back - scattered intensities ( measured for each output pulse of the laser ) and the associated set of @xmath13 patterns used to provide the structured illumination .",
    "an overview of the reconstruction algorithm is shown in fig.[figure2 ] ( the result in this diagram represents a scene of three objects @xmath14 apart in depth ) .",
    "the high - speed digitiser converts the amplified analog signals ( fig.[figure2]b ) into discrete data points ( fig.[figure2]c ) , which are subsequently processed by the computer algorithm . whereas typical single - pixel imaging schemes use the integrated signal for each illumination pattern to reconstruct a 2d image , our algorithm utilises @xmath15 discretely sampled intensity points from the time varying signal to reconstruct @xmath15 2d images , resulting in an @xmath16 image cube ( fig.[figure2]d ) . in the image cube ,",
    "each transverse pixel @xmath17 has an intensity distribution ( fig.[figure2]e ) along the longitudinal axis @xmath18 , which is related to the temporal shape of the pulse , the detector response , the readout digitisation and the pixel depth and reflectivity information .    to enhance the range precision beyond the limits imposed by the sampling rate of the system ,",
    "methods such as parametric deconvolution @xcite and curve fitting can be employed .",
    "however , often these methods can be computationally intensive , which makes them unsuitable for real - time applications . instead we choose to apply cubic spline interpolation to the reconstructed temporal signal at each pixel location , which introduces minimal computational overhead .",
    "the depth of the scene ( fig.[figure2]f ) is subsequently determined by finding the maximum in these interpolated signals .",
    "in addition , the scene reflectivity ( fig.[figure2]g ) can be calculated by averaging the image cube along the longitudinal axis .",
    "utilizing both the depth and reflectivity information , a 3d image of the scene is then reconstructed .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , with the assumption that there is only one surface at each transverse pixel location , our depth estimation ( see detail in methods ) works well for scenes that have smooth features , such as the mannequin head and ball , since the reconstructed temporal signals should be slowly varying between sample points .",
    "we note that the depth accuracy is limited by the amplitude noise on the data points , over - interpolation only increases the depth precision , but not necessarily the accuracy .",
    "in addition , more interpolation adds more processing time , therefore in our experiments we chose to interpolate by a factor of 5 times when investigating the static scenes with 20 pulses per pattern ( see fig.[figure3]-[figure5 ] ) , and 4 times when investigating scenes with motion ( see fig.[figure6 ] ) , balancing the computational overhead and 3d image quality .",
    "in one experiment , a scene containing a @xmath19 diameter polystyrene soccer ball , a life size skin - tone mannequin head and a screen was located at a distance of @xmath20 from the imaging system ( fig.[figure3]a ) .",
    "the objects were closely separated in distance such that the total depth of the scene was @xmath21 . a complete hadamard set of 16,384 patterns , and their inverse ,",
    "were used as the structured illumination and the back - scattered intensities measured for reconstructing a @xmath22 pixel resolution 3d image ( fig.[figure3]e ) .",
    "the illumination time of each pattern was @xmath23 , corresponding to twenty laser pulses .",
    "the total time for acquisition , data transfer from the digitizer buffer to the computer , and image processing was @xmath24 seconds . the 3d reconstruction shown in fig.[figure3]e exhibits distinguishable features , such as the profile of the head and the ball .        in order to quantitatively",
    "determine the accuracy of our 3d imaging system , the scene was modified to contain only a polystyrene mannequin head ( @xmath25 ) , for which we had reference 3d data obtained via a high - accuracy stereophotogrammetric camera system @xcite .",
    "the mannequin head was located at a distance of @xmath26 from the imaging system . to further demonstrate the system capability for retrieving reflectivity in addition to the depth",
    ", two grey stripes were placed on the head . performing the same acquisition and imaging processing used in fig.[figure3 ]",
    ", we obtained the results shown in fig.[figure4]a - c .",
    "figure [ figure4]d&e show the front and side view comparisons between our 3d reconstruction ( green ) and photographs of the head ( white ) , respectively . after lateral and angular registration and subsequent depth scaling , an error map representing the absolute differences for a chosen region of interest was obtained ( shown in fig.[figure4]f ) . from this comparison",
    "we find our single - pixel 3d imaging system has a root mean square error ( rmse ) of @xmath27 .",
    "one advantage of time - resolved imaging is the ability to distinguish objects at different depths , by artificially time - gating the measured intensity . in certain cases",
    "this enables obscuring objects to be isolated from objects of interest .",
    "similar to previous demonstrations @xcite , we constructed a 3d scene containing a polystyrene mannequin head ( located at a distance of @xmath28 ) and black - coloured netting used to obstruct the line - of - sight ( located at a distance of @xmath29 ) , as illustrated in fig.[figure5]a .",
    "an image of the scene taken using a conventional camera is shown in fig.[figure5]b , which contains no information of the head because of the black netting s obscuring . performing the same acquisition and imaging processing used in fig.[figure3 ] and [ figure4 ] , along with an artificial gating on the photodiode data to ensure no reflected signals from the black netting",
    "are included in the 3d reconstruction , we obtained the results shown in fig.[figure5]c - e .",
    "as before , we note the characteristic features of the mannequin head can be resolved .",
    "in addition to obtaining high - quality 3d images of static scenes , many applications demand video frame - rates for motion tracking in dynamic scenes .",
    "a key merit of single - pixel imaging is the ability to take advantage of the sparsity of the scene and use compressive sensing to reduce the acquisition time .",
    "most compressive sensing schemes are performed by minimizing a certain measure of the sparsity , such as @xmath30-norm , to find the sparsest image as the optimal reconstruction of the scene .",
    "however , for resolutions greater than @xmath31 pixels , the time taken by the construction algorithm often prohibits real - time application @xcite .        in this work",
    "we employ an alternative scheme , known as evolutionary compressive sensing @xcite , which aims to reconstruct the image with significant less time than conventional compressive sensing by performing a linear iteration . in short ,",
    "the evolutionary compressive sensing scheme chooses a subset of the hadamard basis to display , by selecting the patterns with the most significant intensities measured in the previous frame , in addition to a fraction of randomly selected patterns that were not displayed . in this experiment , a scene consisting of a static polystyrene mannequin head and a polystyrene white ball ( @xmath19 diameter ) swinging along the line of sight with a period of @xmath32 ( fig.[figure6]a ) .",
    "the scene was located at a distance of @xmath33 from the imaging system .",
    "two laser pulses were used per illumination pattern . with the approach described above we obtained continuous real - time 3d video with a frame - rate of @xmath34 using @xmath35 patterns ( including their inverse ) from the available @xmath36 hadamard set , equivalent to a compression ratio of @xmath37 .",
    "the experimental parameters for this result were chosen to balance the inherent trade - off between frame - rate and image quality .",
    "figure[figure6]b - h show a sample of consecutive frames from the 3d video .",
    "the result shows an identifiable 3d image of the mannequin head and ball , in addition to the real - time motion of the ball .",
    "importantly however , 3d reconsctruction can be performed using fewer patterns to achieve higher frame - rates if required , for instance using 256 patterns provides @xmath12 video .",
    "we have demonstrated that our single - pixel 3d imaging system is capable of reconstructing a scene with millimetric ranging accuracy using modest hardware . additionally , we obtained real - time video rates by taking advantage of a modified compressive sensing scheme that does not rely on lengthy post - processing .",
    "the performance of the system in this work was mainly limited by the repetition rate of the laser employed , @xmath38 . using a laser with a repetition rate greater than or equal to the dmd modulation rate , could enable faster 3d video rates by a factor of three and/or increase reconstruction accuracy by increased averaging .    furthermore , the broad operational spectrum ( @xmath39 ) of the dmd could enable the system to be extended to the non - visible wavelength , such as the infrared ( ir ) , using modified source and detection optics . the use of dmds in the ir have already been demonstrated in microscopy @xcite and real - time video cameras @xcite . the potential application of 3d imaging in the infrared could provide enhanced visibility at long - range , due to reduced atmospheric scattering @xcite .",
    "the following components were used in the experimental setup ( fig.[figure1 ] ) : a pulsed laser ( teem photonics sng-03e-100 ,",
    "@xmath40 ) , a dmd ( texas instruments discovery 4100 dmd ) , a projection lens ( nikon ed , f=@xmath41 ) , a collection lens ( customised fresnel condenser lens , f=@xmath42 ) , a si biased photodiode ( thorlabs det10a ) and a high - speed usb digitizer ( picoscope 6407 , 2.5gs@xmath43 for 2 channels acquisition ) .",
    "there are several important points worth mentioning .",
    "( a ) the modulation rate of the dmd can reach up to @xmath44 , however , in this experiment the dmd is operated in slave - mode , meaning the modulation rate is determined by the repetition rate of the laser at @xmath38 .",
    "( b ) the active area of the photodiode is @xmath45 , used in conjuction with a @xmath42 focal length fresnel lens system , giving a @xmath46 field - of - view , which matches that of the projection system .",
    "the depth estimation includes gaussian smoothing , intensity calibration , cubic spline interpolation , and depth determination .",
