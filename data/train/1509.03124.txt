    "systems of large numbers of self - propelled particles are commonly found in nature . in three space dimensions ,",
    "well - known examples include fish schools , flocks of birds and insects @xcite . in two space dimensions , typical examples are bacteria , such as myxobacteria and _ bacillus subtilis _ @xcite .",
    "however , the interest in such systems is not limited to biological examples .",
    "it has been found that the underlying principles also often apply to human walking behavior @xcite and physical systems , such as granular media @xcite .",
    "the main interest in these systems , both mathematically and from an application s point of view , stems from their emergent properties .",
    "emergence refers to the fact that fairly local interaction rules between the agents like attraction , alignment , repulsion , etc .",
    "give rise to large scale collective behavior .",
    "emergence is physically described as a phase transition to an ordered state ( see e.g. the review @xcite ) .",
    "mathematical models often rely on a particle ( agent ) based description @xcite . among these models ,",
    "the time dependent vicsek model @xcite and variants of it have received much attention owing to its structural simplicity , while convincingly describing a wide range of phenomena .",
    "the general idea of the vicsek model is to describe the agents as particles , moving with constant speed . at each time",
    "step each particle adjusts its direction towards the mean direction of the particles in its neighborhood subject to some random perturbation .",
    "+ whilst particle models are a good tool to reproduce and study the observed phenomena , the high number of agents involved make simulations computationally costly considering the amount of detail one is interested in .",
    "hydrodynamic ( macroscopic ) models are typically easier to simulate and analyze and thereby offer a powerful alternative .",
    "therefore a lot of effort has been made to formulate macroscopic equations starting from particle models @xcite .",
    "mathematically one of the main challenges is the lack of conserved quantities , which is typically a key ingredient in the computation of the macroscopic limit ( see again @xcite ) .",
    "this lack of conservation is frequent in biological systems , which , as opposed to many physical systems , e.g. do nt conserve momentum .",
    "one strategy to overcome this is the use of _ generalized collision invariants ( gci ) _ , introduced for the first time in @xcite to derive a hydrodynamic model of the vicsek dynamics ( later on referred to as the self - organized hydrodynamic ( soh ) model ) .",
    "the passage from individual - based to hydrodynamic models involves the construction of an intermediate kinetic model . for classical physical systems , momentum or",
    "energy conservation translates at the kinetic level into the concept of collision invariants .",
    "this is generalized to the gci concept if the underlying system does not satisfy these conditions .",
    "the rigorous passage from kinetic to soh models has been achieved in @xcite .",
    "the gci concept has been used in a variety of cases @xcite and even applied to a model of economics @xcite .",
    "modal analysis of the soh model can be found in @xcite .",
    "one important feature of the vicsek model is the emergence of phase transitions .",
    "these are studied in the kinetic of macroscopic framework in @xcite . here",
    ", we concentrate on the derivation of macroscopic models and postpone the analysis of phase transitions to future works .",
    "+ in this paper we want to apply this method to nematic alignment of polar , rod - shaped particles moving with constant speed in two space dimensions .",
    "nematic alignment describes the situation where upon meeting , two particles either align if their mutual angle is acute or anti - align if their angle is obtuse .",
    "this nematic alignment rule typically results from volume exclusion and can be understood as an inelastic collision between polar particles .",
    "it differs from polar alignment of polar particles ( which is akin to ferromagnetic interactions in spin systems , as is the case of the vicsek model ) and nematic alignment of apolar particles ( active nematics , which is typically observed in liquid crystals @xcite , in fibrous tissues @xcite or in systems of interacting disks @xcite ) .",
    "large collections of polar particles which nematically align have been observed to exhibit interesting macroscopic patterns such as high density traveling bands and their properties differ from the other types of alignment @xcite . therefore the need for a hydrodynamic model derived from particle dynamics arises and this work suggests how to derive such a model . in the derivation we account for purely local interactions as well as weakly non - local interactions which leads to an additional diffusion term in the macroscopic limit .",
    "+ to give an example how the nematic soh model can be applied to biological systems , we consider the case of myxobacteria . due to their ability to produce several macroscopic structures , such as waves , spirals and clusters @xcite",
    ", they have already received a lot of attention in terms of mathematical models @xcite . since this type of bacteria can internally reverse its polarity",
    ", the model has to be complemented with a reaction term , describing these reversals .",
    "we demonstrate how such a term can be incorporated in a systematic way into the original model .",
    "+ the rest of the document is structured as follows : in section [ sec : particle_mf ] we describe the particle model for nematic alignment and the resulting mean - field model .",
    "the derived alignment operator @xmath0 is examined in section [ sec : prop_qal ] .",
    "whilst it shares some properties with its polar alignment counterpart , there are also some differences , e.g. the set of equilibria has dimension three ( instead of two ) .",
    "mathematically more unexpected , showing the existence and uniqueness of solutions of the related linear operator , which amounts to proving a poincar inequality , is slightly more complex than in the polar case @xcite .",
    "the section finishes with explicitly characterizing the equilibria and generalized collision invariants of @xmath0 . with these ingredients",
    "we derive the macroscopic model in section [ sec : hydro ] and prove its hyperbolicity . in section",
    "[ sec : nonlocal ] we assume weakly non - local interactions and derive the corresponding macroscopic model . finally in section [ sec : myxo ] we apply both macroscopic models to the case of myxobacteria by additionally describing density dependent reversal at the particle level . in the macroscopic model this leads to a reaction term which structurally hints at interesting dynamics",
    "expected to take place .",
    "as a first step towards a macroscopic model , we start with the description of a time - continuous particle ( or agent - based ) model .",
    "the model s structure is similar to the time - continuous version of the vicsek model presented in @xcite and we will discuss similarities and differences .",
    "we image the particles to resemble stiff rods of equal length and describe the @xmath1-th particle ( @xmath2 ) at time @xmath3 by its center of mass @xmath4 and its orientation @xmath5 , where we define @xmath6 as the polar vectors associated with the angle  @xmath7 in a fixed reference frame and where @xmath8 is defined modulo @xmath9 .",
    "all particles are assumed to move in the direction of their orientation with constant speed , @xmath10 . in particular this",
    "means that they can not drift side - ways ( as opposed to the model in @xcite ) . under these hypotheses ,",
    "the motion of the particles is supposed to satisfy the following system of stochastic differential equations @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the average nematic alignment direction .",
    "it is defined as follows : first define a mean nematic current @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the interaction radius .",
    "next define @xmath15 as an angle of lines ( i.e. an angle defined modulo @xmath16 ) such that : @xmath17 we note that the definition of the vector on the left - hand side of ( [ eq : def_bar_theta_i ] ) does not depend on the choice of the reference frame used to measure the angles @xmath18 as @xmath15 can be equivalently defined by @xmath19 and we notice that this relation is invariant under a uniform translation of all angles . to obtain a unique representation of the angles , we will use the convention that the particle angles @xmath8 are taken in @xmath20 and the nematic angles @xmath15 are taken in @xmath21 . for simplicity",
    ", we will identify @xmath20 with @xmath22 and with the unit circle @xmath23 .",
    "the notation @xmath24 describes independent brownian motions with intensity @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "we are aiming for a separation of the particles into two ( locally defined ) groups , one with @xmath27 and one with @xmath28 . therefore",
    ", diffusion must vanish near @xmath29 , to avoid particles crossing the boundary between these two angular regions .",
    "the factor @xmath30 is intended to avoid that the two groups mix .",
    "the first term in the velocity evolution describes alignment with the bacteria within the interaction radius @xmath31 with an alignment frequency @xmath32 with @xmath33 . due to the factor @xmath34",
    ", alignment occurs parallel or anti - parallel to the mean angle @xmath35 , depending on whether @xmath18 is closer to @xmath35 or @xmath36 .",
    "note that @xmath37 is a @xmath16-periodic function and so , does not depend on the choice of @xmath35 or @xmath36 as the representative of the corresponding angle of lines .",
    "also other notions of nematic alignment between several particles are possible . in @xcite",
    "the nematic mean direction was defined as @xmath38 the main difference between this definition and is that the nematic angle defined in depends on the particle index @xmath1 only via the position @xmath39 , but is independent of the direction of the @xmath1-th particle , @xmath18 .",
    "the outcome of on the other hand depends on both the position and the direction of the @xmath1-th particle . whilst the definition from @xcite might be closer to reality , if the dispersion around the mean angle is small , both types of nematic alignment lead to the same behavior .",
    "however , the independence from @xmath18 makes mathematically much easier to handle .",
    "we follow the usual procedure to derive the mean field limit as described for example in @xcite .",
    "the procedure starts with the definition of the empirical distribution function @xmath40 , with @xmath41 , @xmath42 ( modulo @xmath43 ) and @xmath44 , according to @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the dirac delta in @xmath47 space located at @xmath48 at time  @xmath49 . in the absence of noise ( @xmath50 )",
    ", @xmath51 is a deterministic measure that satisfies a first order kinetic equation if we assume that all @xmath52 fulfill - . if @xmath53 , @xmath54 is a random measure whose law satisfies a second order kinetic equation .",
    "then as @xmath55 , @xmath54 approximates a distribution function @xmath56 , satisfying the following kolmogorov - fokker - planck type equation : @xmath57 where the collision operator @xmath58 is given by @xmath59 ,   \\label{eqn : scaling_qal }   \\ ] ] and where @xmath60 is given by @xmath61 we note from ( [ eqn : scaling_jf_0 ] ) that @xmath62 is an angle of lines , defined modulo @xmath16 and a representative of @xmath62 will be chosen in @xmath63 .",
    "we also note that ( [ eqn : scaling_jf_0])-([eqn : scaling_jf ] ) can be equivalently written @xmath64 at this point the alignment interaction is non - local which is reflected in the fact that the computations for @xmath65 involve integrals over a ball centered around  @xmath66 . as a next step",
    "we introduce dimensionless variables .",
    "since we are interested in macroscopic phenomena , we use a hydrodynamic scaling . in the following",
    "we will do the non - dimensionalization and the hydrodynamic scaling in one step .",
    "a more detailed description for a similar equation can be found in @xcite . on a microscopic scale",
    "we use the reference time @xmath67 and reference length @xmath68 .",
    "we also introduce a scaled diffusion constant @xmath69 . on the macroscopic scale we want to use units @xmath70 and @xmath71 , which are large compared to the microscopic ones .",
    "we introduce the new ( dimensionless , macroscopic ) variables @xmath72 and @xmath73 and set @xmath74 .",
    "additionally we scale @xmath75 with @xmath76 .",
    "note that the scaling of @xmath77 supposes that the interactions between the particles are local .",
    "another scaling which takes better account of the non - locality of the interactions will be investigated later on ( see section [ sec : nonlocal ] ) . with this scaling and dropping the hats for better readability we find that @xmath78 satisfies the problem : @xmath79 with ( omitting the variables @xmath66 and @xmath49 ) : @xmath80 ,   \\label{eqn :",
