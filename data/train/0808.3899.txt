    "many transition metal oxides display phenomena that are believed to be associated with both strong electronic correlations and disorder .",
    "various metal - to - nonmetal transitions @xcite , and some properties of the underdoped high - t@xmath1 cuprate superconductors @xcite are examples of such physics .",
    "presently the study of such systems is a very active field of research in condensed matter physics .    theoretically , the simplest model that hopefully represents some of the key physics of such systems is the so - called anderson - hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "the anderson model @xcite is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 denote the sites of the lattice , @xmath4 implies that @xmath5 and @xmath6 are near neighbours , @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is the destruction ( number ) operator for an electron at site @xmath5 with spin @xmath9 , and the hopping energy is denoted by @xmath10 .",
    "the on - site energy at site @xmath5 is given by @xmath11 , and in this report we have examined two models of disorder : ( i ) a 50/50 binary alloy model , where @xmath11 is set equal to @xmath12 ( for an @xmath13 site ) or @xmath14 ( for a @xmath15 site ) ; and ( ii ) a box distribution of on - site energies in which all site energies in the range @xmath14 to @xmath16 are equally likely .",
    "the electron interactions that are included are represented by the hubbard term @xcite , given by @xmath17 the anderson - hubbard model is formed from the sum of @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "there has been considerable work on this model over the last several decades , and most of the interest in this model arises from the hope that this model contains some of the essential physics required to describe disordered transition - metal oxides , including their metal - to - insulator transitions @xcite .",
    "for example , several numerical calculations have been completed using different variants of the quantum monte - carlo technique @xcite .",
    "there are also some exact solutions available for lattices of very small sizes @xcite , including very recent work on the exact spectral functions for lattices of 10 sites @xcite .    here",
    "we present our exact results for several one - dimensional chains and a two - dimensional 4x4 lattice at and below half filling . in this , and a future companion paper @xcite introducing the application of partially - projected gutzwiller variational wave functions to the anderson - hubbard model , we use these solutions to assess the ability of variational wave functions to represent both the energies and correlations of ground - state wave functions . here",
    "we present our comparisons of the exact solutions to those found in the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation .",
    "indeed , the simplest and most common approach to finding approximate solutions for interacting systems is that of using a self - consistent , real - space unrestricted hartree - fock approach . in this approach",
    "the disorder is treated exactly , thus allowing for the inclusion of coherent back scattering , whereas the interactions are dealt with in an approximate fashion .",
    "the hf approach has been used in various ways in previous studies , and some examples include ( i ) an attempt to study the high-@xmath20 cuprates via a determination of the phase diagram of the disordered two - dimensional hubbard model @xcite , ( ii ) a detailed examination of the 3d metal - to - insulator transition @xcite , including a discussion of transitions in some cubic disordered tungsten bronzes @xcite , ( iii ) a proposal for a novel metallic phase in two dimensions that results from the combined effects of correlations and disorder @xcite , and ( iv ) work by one of us and coworkers @xcite studying the metal - to - insulator transition in lial@xmath21ti@xmath22o@xmath23 , examining the possibility of the presence of strong correlations in the liti@xmath24o@xmath23 system ( which has been proposed @xcite to be a non - cuprate fully three - dimensional material that is related to the quasi - two - dimensional high-@xmath20 cuprates ) .",
    "the conclusions drawn from these studies are subject to the veracity of the approximation used , namely the hf approach , and a focus of this paper is to provide a partial assessment of this technique .",
    "the hf decoupling scheme is well known , discussed at length elsewhere ( _ e.g. _ , see @xcite ) , but for completeness we summarize the final results .",
    "the hf technique can be thought of as an approach in which one ignores terms in the interaction hamiltonian , _ viz . _",
    "the hubbard hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham_hub ] ) , that are proportional to fluctuations about mean values squared .",
    "that is , one approximates the local hubbard interaction as being replaced by ( here we ignore the possibility of local superconducting pairing correlations ) @xmath25 where @xmath26 , and the effective local fields @xmath27 are given by @xmath28 then , one must find self consistently the local spin - resolved charge densities and local fields that minimize the variational estimate of the ground - state energy .",
    "one aspect of our study is to examine the manner in which allowing for paramagnetic ( pm ) hf solutions , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath29 and @xmath30 , in comparison to restricted hf solutions , _ i.e. _ @xmath31 ( in general ) and @xmath30 , which from now on we refer to as the afm hf solutions , in comparison to fully unrestricted hf solutions,_i.e .",
    "_ @xmath31 ( in general ) and @xmath32 ( in general ) improves the correct representation of the correlations in these systems .",
    "that is , by allowing for new degrees of freedom the variational principle guarantees that we can only lower the variational estimate of the ground - state energy .",
    "indeed , we present results of such behaviour in this paper .",
    "however , while one has improved on the estimate of the energy , does that necessarily mean that one is doing a better job at representing the correlations using such variational wave functions ?",
    "after presenting our results we will discuss them in relation to certain results in the literature @xcite that rely on choosing which magnetic degrees of freedom are  active \" in their associated variational wave functions .    as a demonstration of this issue in figure [ fig:2siteordered ]",
    "we show both the afm and pm hf energies , and the magnitudes of the overlaps of these wave functions with those of the exact solutions , for a two - site ( ordered ) cluster ( with open boundary conditions ) .",
    "one sees that for @xmath33 the afm solutions have lower energies , but ( unfortunately ) the overlaps of the pm and exact wave functions are far larger than the overlaps of the afm and exact wave functions in this same range of @xmath34 .",
    "that is , obtaining a better variational estimate of the energy does not guarantee a better representation of the ground - state wave function .",

    "the lower panel shows a similar comparison for the overlap quantity defined by @xmath35 . although the afm energy is closer to the exact energy for @xmath36 the overlap with the pm hf solution is better over the same range of interactions .",

    "the pm hf solution gives @xmath40 for all @xmath41 , whereas for the afm hf solution at large @xmath34 one finds essentially anti - parallel classical spins , thus giving a value of @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , at least in this one example , as one improves the energy by allowing for magnetic hf solutions one in fact decreases the agreement between the exact and hf spin correlations .    for spatially disordered systems all calculations must be computed numerically .",
    "we have found all self - consistent hf ground - state wave functions to an absolute accuracy ( for the local spin - resolved charge densities and effective fields ) of at least 10@xmath43 , and often to a much higher accuracy .",

    "however , for larger systems this is not as practical to do this , and instead we have calculated the average absolute difference of the exact and hf charge densities , defined by @xmath47        we have examined several complexions of disorder for the @xmath48 cluster at 1/2 filling , but as mentioned above for this small cluster it is instructive to focus on one representative configuration . the disorder for the configuration discussed below is given by @xmath49 the  bandwidth \" for the noninteracting ordered @xmath48 cluster ( with periodic boundary conditions ) is @xmath50 , and therefore we have examined weak @xmath51 , intermediate @xmath52 and strong @xmath53 disorder , and then varied @xmath34 continuously from zero to roughly twice @xmath54 .",

    "( we show plots of similar data for the ten - site cluster in the next section . )",
    "of course , these transitions are spurious , as the exact ground states are singlets for all disorders and @xmath41 and no moments are present on any site .",

    "we have determined that these substantial overlaps ( for @xmath34 less than 0.6 , 1.6 and 4.3 , for weak , intermediate and strong disorder ) are largely due to the fact that the exact ground state is dominated by one single probability amplitude , and therefore a product - state solution such as hf is able to reliably reproduce such a state .",

    "for a correlated system close to half filling local magnetic moments are formed which have strong antiferromagnetic near - neighbour correlations , and as outlined in the detailed work of shraiman and siggia the manner in which vacancies ( say an empty site created by having a doubly occupied site that is close by ) become mobile in such an antiferromagnetic background is by a dipolar backflow of the magnetization current producing _ spin twists _",

    "<S> we critique the success of this approximation by making comparisons between such solutions and the exact wave functions for the anderson - hubbard model . due to the sizes of the complete hilbert spaces for these problems , </S>",
    "<S> the comparisons are restricted to small one - dimensional chains , up to ten sites , and a 4x4 two - dimensional cluster , and at 1/2 filling these hilbert spaces contain about 63,500 and 166 million states , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we have completed these calculations both at and away from 1/2 filling . </S>",
    "<S> this approximation is based on a variational approach which minimizes the hartree - fock energy , and we have completed comparisons of the exact and hartree - fock energies . however , in order to assess the success of this approximation in reproducing ground - state correlations we have completed comparisons of the local charge and spin correlations , including the calculation of the overlap of the hartree - fock wave functions with those of the exact solutions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that this approximation reproduces the local charge densities to quite a high accuracy , but that the local spin correlations , as represented by @xmath0 , are not as well represented . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to these comparisons , we discuss the properties of the spin degrees of freedom in the hf approximation , and where in the disorder - interaction phase diagram such physics may be important . </S>"
