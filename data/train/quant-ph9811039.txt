    "the problem of understanding why quantum computation is more efficient than classical computation has recently received a systematic attention : a reason fundamental enough might be leveraged for broadening the spectrum of efficient quantum algorithms .",
    "ekert and jozsa ( 1998 ) have demonstrated that quantum entanglement is essentially involved in providing the efficiency ( see also kitaev , 1997 ) , but  until now quantum measurement has been left in the background .",
    "we will show that , by explicitly considering it , quantum computation reveals a non - mechanistic or teleological character as far as it is `` intelligently '' driven by _ both _ initial and final conditions .",
    "thus , mechanism ( everything driven by initial conditions , randomness @xmath0 ignorance of initial conditions , blindness to final conditions ) , a central dogma of classical science , would be scientifically disproved by quantum computation efficiency ( first shown by deutsch , 1985 ) .",
    "this will be shown by working on simon s algorithm ( simon , 1994 ) , which is summarized in the following .",
    "given a function @xmath1 , with @xmath2 , 2-to-1 with periodicity @xmath3 ( e.g. fig .",
    "1a ) , the problem is finding @xmath3 in poly ( n ) steps .",
    "we have to assume that , given a value @xmath4 of @xmath5 , the computation of @xmath6 requires poly(n ) steps , whereas given a value @xmath7 of @xmath8 , the computation of @xmath9 and @xmath10 such that @xmath11 requires exp(n ) steps : the function must be hard to `` reverse '' with classical computation ( `` invert '' is avoided since the function has no inverse ) .",
    "( a)(b )    fig . 1    let @xmath12 @xmath13 be the register containing @xmath5 @xmath14 , @xmath15 be the hadamard transform on register @xmath12 , @xmath16 .",
    "simon s algorithm ( fig .",
    "1b ) is implemented through the following _ actions _ :",
    "\\a ) prepare : @xmath17    \\b ) perform @xmath15 : @xmath18    \\c ) for each @xmath19 compute @xmath20 , put result in @xmath21 @xmath22    \\d ) measure @xmath20 , obtaining say @xmath23 @xmath24 ( @xmath25 is not a function of the former states only , this is emphasized by changing notation from @xmath26 to @xmath27 ) ; step ( d ) is unnecessary but makes understanding easier ;    \\e ) perform @xmath28  @xmath29 \\left| z\\right\\rangle _ { a}\\left| \\overline{f}\\right\\rangle _ { b};$ ] the sign @xmath30 denotes the module 2 internal product of two binary numbers ( seen as row matrices ) ;    \\f ) measure @xmath31 ( time @xmath32 ) : @xmath33 must be 0 for registered @xmath31 ; see the form of @xmath34 ;    \\g ) by repeating the overall process a number of times poly(n ) on average , a number of constraints @xmath35 sufficient to identify @xmath3 is gathered .",
    "in order to show the non - mechanistic character of simon s algorithm , it is convenient to circumscribe its central part from @xmath36 to @xmath37 where `` efficiency '' is achieved : the algorithm leading and trailing edges involve neither entanglement nor quantum efficiency . to facilitate exposition ,",
    "let us say that @xmath38 already contains the _ readable _ period @xmath3 : readable by means of the algorithm trailing edge , in a polynomial number of repetitions of the whole process ; or _ readable _ for short by ignoring polynomial differences of efficiency .    with reference to steps ( c ) and ( d ) , we should note that @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath40 would allow for @xmath41 , making the quantum state two - valued ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 at the same time ) , a possibility that should be discarded .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the notation @xmath44 , thus @xmath45 .",
    "besides producing the _ random _ _ outcome _",
    "@xmath7  in register @xmath46 , collapse _",
    "_ makes _  _ an _  intelligent choice _ in _  _",
    "register @xmath12 , by selecting the superposition @xmath47 which contains the `` readable '' period @xmath3 , thus leading toward problem solution .",
    "the essential point is that @xmath47 is a non - redundant function of both the initial condition @xmath48 and the measurement outcome @xmath49 , namely a final condition occurring at time @xmath50 and not univocally determined by the initial condition since wave function collapse is in between :    @xmath51    according to equation ( 1 ) , the mechanistic notion that everything is determined by initial conditions ( with randomness @xmath52 ignorance of initial conditions ) , holding in classical computation , is violated : @xmath53 is clearly determined by both initial and final conditions .",
    "we will show how non - mechanism is leveraged in simon s algorithm from two different perspectives :    \\(i ) things might be clearer by back - dating the outcome of collapse at time @xmath54 , after step ( b ) and before ( c ) .",
    "the final actions of ( in reverse order ) registering @xmath55 measuring register @xmath46 , and computing @xmath20 , change @xmath56 into @xmath57 where the arguments @xmath9 and @xmath10 are such that their function ( computed afterward ) @xmath58 @xmath7 ; these final actions have therefore reversed the computation of the direct function , by running it back in time ( starting from @xmath37 and @xmath7 ) , thus taking the same time and achieving higher than classical efficiency .    in equivalent terms",
    ", it can be said that the measurement outcome goes back in time yielding efficiency , it is therefore essential that the computation process is _ reversible _ ( bennett , 1979 ; fredkin and toffoli , 1982 ) .",
    "we should note that , according to the current model , this backward propagation is _ confined _ within the unobserved , reversible life of the quantum system , namely between the initial measurement ( required to prepare the system ) and the final measurement , without any possibility of carrying information back in time in the classical world .",
    "\\(ii ) the following yields another perspective . the final action of measuring @xmath20 both _ creates _ the output _  _ constraint @xmath59 and _ selects _ the superposition of the two arguments @xmath9 and @xmath10 which satisfy it . introducing and satisfying this constraint is an essential step to solve the problem ; doing both things at once , analogically , yields quantum computation efficiency . on the contrary , of course no independent constraint can be set on the output of _ classical _ , mechanistic computation , which is the _ deterministic _ propagation of the input of a reversible boolean network .",
    "the teleological character of quantum computation is clear : we are dealing with a time evolution ( comprising collapse ) satisfying ( i.e. driven by ) both an input condition and an output constraint @xmath60 as implied by eq .",
    "we should note that putting a constraint on  the output of a hard to reverse function is a general way of creating an np problem .",
    "interestingly , non - mechanism brings us to re - examine the notion of causality in the quantum framework .",
    "causality should go forward in time during the direct computation of @xmath61 and backward in time during reverse computation , in the same time - interval .",
    "let us see that there is no contradiction .",
    "in fact both the forward propagation @xmath62 and the backward propagation @xmath63 undergoes the same transformations of @xmath62 , but with a different initial ( or final ) condition : while @xmath64 starts from the preparation , @xmath65 ( deterministically ) ends into the measurement outcome @xmath38 , or it goes back in time starting from that outcome . ] ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 stand for forward and backward in time ) are , up to an undefined overall phase @xmath66 ( castagnoli , 1995 ) :    @xmath67    where @xmath68 is the _ retarded wave _ , associated with forward - in - time causality , and",
    "@xmath69 is the _ advanced wave _ , associated with backward - in - time causality , both undergoing the same transformations of @xmath70 . without going into detail , let us give such two waves in the central part of simon s algorithm :    @xmath71 \\left| 0\\right\\rangle _ { b},$ ]    @xmath72 .$ ]    the upper ( lower ) signs apply to the retarded ( advanced ) wave .",
    "the time - symmetry of a _",
    "reversible _ process imposes a gauge symmetry on @xmath73 , it must be a random variable with uniform distribution in @xmath74 $ ] : this makes the two waves mathematically indistinguishable , either wave can thus be associated with either direction of causality . in conclusion ,",
    "both directions of causality coexist in either @xmath75 or @xmath76 , and there is no privileged direction at all .",
    "parenthetically , we should note that each wave , representing a _ single _ direction of causality , is an incomplete description ( castagnoli , 1995 ) @xmath60 typical of the method of random phases ( finkelstein 1996 ) .",
    "whereas @xmath62 and @xmath76 are pure quantum states : @xmath66 either disappears or becomes an irrelevant overall phase .    of course , advanced - retarded wave indistinguishability does not affect the asymmetry between preparation and measurement outcome ( thus also between @xmath64 and @xmath77 ) , which comes from our capability of controlling the state of the quantum object ( see also vaidman , 1998 ; aharonov et al .",
    ", 1964 ) .",
    "while the preparation is under complete control , obtained by correcting a previous , random measurement outcome , the final measurement outcome is not under complete control in any of the current algorithms .",
    "partial control ( yielding the `` intelligent choice '' ) is what provides quantum efficiency in some np  problems .",
    "we will show in section iii that total control of the measurement outcome would yield in principle np - complete = p.    eventually , let us show that skipping step ( d ) is indifferent ; we will follow a shortcut . whether step ( d ) has been performed or skipped",
    "indistinguishable _ to the observer of register @xmath12 at time @xmath32 ( otherwise there could be superluminal communication between space - separated regions @xmath12 and @xmath46 ) .",
    "therefore it is _ equivalent _ to keep step ( d ) there even if it is not performed .",
    "this time , measurement of an entangled state is involved , therefore we should not think that the result @xmath78 ( section i )  is already `` written '' in the state before measurement and that measurement serves to `` read '' this result . measurement _ creates _ the result , by constraining the output of @xmath61 computation .",
    "we shall review a speculative but plausible algorithm which puts under complete control a measurement outcome , yielding np - complete = p ( castagnoli , sept .",
    "let @xmath61 be a general boolean function ( fig .",
    "2 ) with constraints both on part of the input ( which make the function hard to reverse ) and on the output ; conventionally , the output constraint is 1 . the problem is whether there is an assignment of the unconstrained part of the input @xmath79 , @xmath80 , ... satisfying all input and output constraints .",
    "this is a version of the well - known np - complete sat problem .",
    "2    the computer register must comprise both the input and output qubits appearing in fig .",
    "2 ; each unconstrained input is prepared in @xmath81 . by using conventional quantum computation ,",
    "we compute the direct function , reaching in polynomial time an entangled state @xmath82 which is an equally weighted superposition of all tensor products of qubits eigenstates which satisfy the input constraint and @xmath61 ( while the output constraint may not be satisfied ) . at this time interaction",
    "has ceased and all registers qubits are independent of each other .    to simplify ,",
    "say that the network has exactly one solution : the problem is to find it .",
    "all @xmath82 s tensor products but one end with @xmath83 .",
    "a @xmath84 rotation is now applied to the independent qubit @xmath85 ( in order to bring it from about @xmath86 to about @xmath87 ) , while the overall network state is ( speculatively ) submitted to a _ continuous _ measurement , such that it is continuously projected on the constrained hilbert subspace @xmath88 . by definition",
    ", @xmath89 is the span of all the vectors which satisfy the input constraints and @xmath61 ( note that @xmath90 as all subsequent measurement outcomes belong to @xmath91 ) .",
    "this generates a unitary propagation of the network state which , in one computation step ( the @xmath84 rotation ) , leads to a state close to the solution ( ending with @xmath92 ) .",
    "qubit measurement gives the solution with high probability .",
    "the notion of continuous measurement , as the associated `` special '' zeno effect ( keeping the propagation inside @xmath89 ) , is strictly based on a retarded - advanced wave model . without it",
    ", we would remain with the mechanistic notion of frequent measurement in the limit of infinite frequency .",
    "this would bring in a different zeno effect freezing the propagation ( no more driven by both initial and final conditions ) in its initial state . by the way , this discrepancy between continuous and frequent measurement might lead to ascertaining the existence of an advanced propagation .",
    "we have shown that a quantum propagation comprising measurement and wave function collapse ( here a revamped notion ) is strictly non - mechanistic in character , being driven by both initial and final conditions .",
    "although non - mechanism justifies the efficiency of quantum computation , it should be noted that it came out in the past in several forms , apparently without being acknowledged .",
    "maybe , because the notion of causality going back and forth in time is often `` aborred '' , considered with either no consequences ( an idle interpretation ) or too many ( time - travel ) .",
    "hopefully , this work should convince the reader that both concerns are not justified .",
    "\\(i ) in the simplest case of an elementary ( un - compound ) object , eq .",
    "( 1 ) tells that the outcome of measurement is a function of itself ( is what it is ) : the only constraint is that it is one of the outcomes allowed by the state before measurement .",
    "this is freedom from the past @xmath60 namely non - mechanism .",
    "here the measurement outcome can be controlled only in a stochastic way ( the probability amplitudes can be prepared ) .",
    "\\(ii ) in the case of a compound object in an entangled state , non - mechanism also appears in the novel form of _ correlation _ between simultaneous eigenvalues of the measurement outcome @xmath60 like in epr measurement .",
    "this is called non locality of course .",
    "however , such a correlation can be described without giving up locality , provided that causality is allowed to go back and forth in time ( bennett , 1995 ; castagnoli , 1995 ) .",
    "\\(iii ) a third level of unfolding of non - mechanism appears when it is leveraged to yield quantum computation efficiency . in current algorithms , as already in ( ii ) , part of the outcome is random , part is correlated .",
    "this yields a capability of solving in polynomial time some np problems .",
    "we have shown a further level of unfolding of non - mechanism , speculative for the time  being .",
    "this corresponds to putting the outcome of measurement under a complete control , by means of a special zeno effect .",
    "this would allow to solve the sat  problem in polynomial time , in principle .",
    "non - mechanism appears to be an exclusively quantum feature of evolutions comprising wave function collapse .",
    "like all exclusively quantum features , on the one hand it is strictly confined between initial and final measurement , on the other hand it yields consequences in the classical world , in fact quantum computation efficiency .",
    "hopefully , the perspective developed in this work will help in the quest for new efficient computation algorithms .",
