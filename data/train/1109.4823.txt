    "the problem of discriminating between operators in quantum mechanics is closely related to that of discriminating between quantum states  @xcite . in order to distinguish between operators ,",
    "a reference state is transformed by the different operators , and then measurements are performed on the result , so that one is ultimately distinguishing between the possible output states .",
    "discriminating between two _ known _ operators has already been treated  @xcite . reconstructing a single unknown operator from measurements on a series of states that have been transformed by it",
    "is known as operator , channel , or quantum process tomography  @xcite . a final problem , operator comparison , which determines whether two unknown unitary operators are the same or different  @xcite , is closely related to the problems considered here .",
    "recently state discrimination problems have been considered in which not all of the states are known  @xcite .",
    "one may know some of the states , but is only provided with examples of the others .",
    "for example , one is given a particle that is guaranteed to be in one of the states @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "the states @xmath0 and @xmath1 are unknown , but instead , an example of each of these states is provided .",
    "the object is to use the reference states to best determine whether the given particle in the unknown state is either @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "another scenario is that @xmath0 is known , but @xmath1 is represented by a reference particle , and one is presented with a particle guaranteed to be in either @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "again the task is to determine the state of the latter unknown particle .    in this paper",
    "we address problems in the realm of operator discrimination , which are the natural analogues of those , decribed above , for quantum state discrimination . instead of having a physical description of the operations ,",
    "they are given as actual operations ( boxes ) which we are allowed to apply to input states .",
    "the situation is reminiscent of oracle quantum computation  @xcite , in which a key component is a device that carries out one of a number of possible transformation .",
    "generally , we would like to decide which particular unlabelled boxes match / correspond to labelled reference boxes or in which order the unlabelled boxes are placed .",
    "the problem can be viewed as programmable pattern matching , `` programmable '' because we do not know the actual operations as they are only supplied as reference `` programs '' .",
    "we shall consider both minimum error , and unambiguous discrimination tasks . in minimum - error discrimination , the object is to always make a guess and to minimize the probability of making a mistake .",
    "in unambiguous discrimination , the procedure is allowed to fail sometimes ( that is , we are allowed sometimes to refuse to make a guess ) but we never want to make a mistake if we do decide to make a determination . the object is to minimize the probability of failure .",
    "we wish to examine whether good procedures for these decision problems can be constructed from pairwise operator comparison .",
    "the task is to compare two unknown operators in order to determine whether or not they are the same . this problem was considered in @xcite , and the best procedure found there was to use a singlet state  @xcite .",
    "each operator is applied to one of the two qubits in the singlet and the result is then measured to see if it has a component in the symmetric subspace , upon which the operators must have been different .",
    "we would like to see if this procedure can be used as a basic unit for more complicated operator comparisons as discussed above .",
    "we shall see that there are cases where singlet - based pairwise comparison strategies are not optimal .",
    "the general scenario which we consider is as follows : alice / bob are given reference boxes , labelled either @xmath2 or @xmath3 , which implement unitary operations on single qubits .",
    "the forms of these two unitary operators are not known to any of the parties .",
    "charlie is given a number of boxes which are unlabelled , but each is guaranteed to perform either @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "our task is to determine what boxes charlie possesses by applying these boxes to a multi - qubit reference state and then measuring the results .",
    "we shall assume that each box can only be applied once and that @xmath2 and @xmath3 are equally and independently likely to be any qubit unitary .",
    "a variety of scenarios is possible .",
    "depending on which boxes are available for alice , bob and charlie .    , and charlie has an unlabelled box which either performs @xmath2 or a different unknown unitary @xmath3 .",
    "b ) alice and bob each have a different reference box implementing @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively , and charlie either has a box which performs @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "we prepare a test state @xmath4 which is acted upon by the operators and is finally measured leading to an outcome @xmath5 . ]",
    "we begin with the simplest case of one reference box and one unlabelled box which may of may not match the reference ( fig .",
    "[ fig : oneunknown]a )",
    ". alice has a box that performs an unknown operation @xmath2 and charlie has one that either performs @xmath2 or an unknown operator @xmath3 .",
    "this is similar to operator comparison  @xcite where it was found that making use of the two - qubit singlet state , @xmath6 , by sending one qubit through each box is a good strategy .",
    "after the qubits have been acted upon by the boxes , we measure the result to see if it lies in the symmetric or antisymmetric subspace .",
    "if the state is found to be symmetric , then the two unitary transforms must have been different .",
    "this is in fact the optimal strategy also for the situation we are now considering , if we confine ourselves to two qubits and demand an unambiguous result .",
    "we have to apply both transforms to a test state @xmath4 , giving two possible cases @xmath7 the forms of the single - qubit operators , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , are unknown , and so we must average over @xmath2 and @xmath3 to obtain the possible output states @xmath8 between which we should distinguish .",
    "the integrals are haar integrals over @xmath9 , and can be performed using the following parameterization .",
    "we first set @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a unit vector equal to @xmath12 , with @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is a vector of the usual pauli matrices .",
    "the second operator , @xmath3 , is parametrized similarly .",
    "we then have that @xmath17 a general 2-qubit test state can be written @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the usual bell states , and @xmath21 .",
    "performing the integrals for this initial test state , see appendix [ integrals ] , we find that @xmath22 here @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the projectors onto the antisymmetric and symmetric subspaces respectively . as the support of @xmath25 is all of the two - qubit space ,",
    "@xmath26 can never be unambiguously identified , as its support will always be contained in that of @xmath25 . to unambiguously identify the state @xmath25",
    ", the initial test state should lie entirely either in the antisymmetric or in the symmetric subspace , and we look for a component of the final state in the symmetric or antisymmetric subspace , respectively .    it is straightforward to check that starting with a singlet state by choosing @xmath27 will give a higher success probability than starting in the symmetric subspace .",
    "the positive operator valued measure ( povm ) elements for the optimal measurement are the projections @xmath28 , corresponding to the inconclusive result ( failure ) , and @xmath29 , corresponding to identifying the state as @xmath25 . therefore , assuming that @xmath26 and @xmath25 are equally probable , the probability of the measurement failing is @xmath30 = \\frac{5}{8 } , \\ ] ] so that the success probability is @xmath31 .",
    "an initial test state in the symmetric subspace would give a success probability of @xmath32 .",
    "now let us consider the minimum - error strategy .",
    "the optimal minimum - error measurement for distinguishing between two states @xmath26 and @xmath25 , with prior probabilities @xmath33 and @xmath34 , has the error probability  @xcite @xmath35 , \\ ] ] where we shall consider the case @xmath36 . substituting in the density matrices from eq .",
    "( [ isak ] ) , we find that @xmath37 this is clearly maximized , and the error probability minimized , when @xmath38 , which occurs when the input state is a singlet . in that case",
    "we have that @xmath39 corresponds to bob s box being @xmath2 , and @xmath40 corresponds to bob s box being @xmath3 , and the probability of error is @xmath41 . for the singlet test state ,",
    "this is the optimal measurement , as the optimal minimum - error measurement .",
    "note that the unambiguous discrimination strategy only gives us an answer when charlie s unknown box is @xmath3 .",
    "if alice instead has a reference box @xmath3 , we can get an answer only when bob s box is @xmath2",
    ". the measurement and success probability stays the same .",
    "let us now consider a decision problem where alice has a reference box @xmath2 , bob has reference box @xmath3 , and charlie has an unlabelled box guaranteed to be either @xmath2 or @xmath3 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : oneunknown]b ) .",
    "first let us look at a three - qubit test state @xmath42 and apply the boxes held by alice , bob and charlie to their respective qubits .",
    "a general pure three - qubit state can be written as @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",
    "this means that we are trying to discriminate between the states latexmath:[\\ ] ] this operator is six - dimensional , but happens to be block diagonal with two blocks of size 3@xmath743 .",
    "this is easily seen since the off - diagonal elements only couple states with an equal number of 0 s and 1 s . ordering the basis vectors within the blocks",
    "@xmath75 and @xmath76 , each of the blocks takes the form @xmath77 the blocks have eigenvalues @xmath78 and zero , and the sum of the absolute values of all eigenvalues is therefore @xmath79 .",
    "this gives an error probability of @xmath80 which is higher than 1/8 .",
    "therefore , the simple singlet strategy ( a singlet either in pair @xmath81 or @xmath61 ) does better .",
    "so far , the best strategies we have found are based on pairwise operator comparison .",
    "can we do better ?",
    "it turns out that if we use a four - qubit state then we can .",
    "in particular , we shall show that it is possible to improve the success probabilities for unambiguous discrimination .",
    "we first note that we can get distinct signals for both operators in the case of unambiguous discrimination if we use four qubits .",
    "let @xmath82 as usual , alice , bob and charlie apply their respective boxes but no operation is applied to the fourth qubit d. it is best to express the resulting states as density matrices .",
    "if charlie s box performs @xmath2 , the operator @xmath83 is applied to @xmath84 , and after averaging over both @xmath2 and @xmath3 we obtain @xmath85 if charlie s box performs @xmath3 , the operator @xmath86 is applied to @xmath84 , and after averaging over both @xmath2 and @xmath3 we obtain @xmath87 we will consider only the case of unambiguous discrimination and first choose the povm elements to be @xmath88 the element @xmath89 corresponds to charlie s box being @xmath2 , @xmath90 corresponds to it being @xmath3 , and @xmath91 corresponds to the indeterminate result .",
    "we find that @xmath92 , which guarantees that the discrimination is unambiguous .",
    "in addition , we have that @xmath93 , which , assuming that the boxes for @xmath2 and @xmath3 are equally probable , gives a success probability of @xmath53 .",
    "this is the same success probability as with the simpler two - qubit procedure , but we now have a probability of unambiguously identifying both boxes , and not just one .    so far , in terms of the overall success probability , we have not gained anything .",
    "we could in fact also have achieved the same result using a two - qubit strategy , by choosing to compare charlie s box against either alice s @xmath2 or bob s @xmath3 with probability 1/2 each .",
    "the fourth qubit above acts like a quantum coin . by using the four - qubit test state in ( [ 4qubit ] ) we can , however , do better than the success probability of @xmath53 . though this test state is most probably not optimal , we can try to improve the povm .",
    "we make use of the results of subspace discrimination to find the optimal povm for the discrimination of the ranges of the two possible density matrices @xcite .",
    "while this does not give the optimal povm for discriminating the two density matrices , it does give one that is better than ( [ three3 ] ) based on two - operator comparison .",
    "the details of the povm that optimally discriminates the ranges of @xmath55 and @xmath57 are given in appendix b. one finds that each density matrix can be detected unambiguously with a probability of @xmath94 , which is greater than @xmath95 .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that there are better procedures than simple pairwise operator comparison for solving our three - box decision problem .",
    "the optimal strategy remains to be determined .",
    "when charlie possesses two unlabelled boxes , there are several scenarios we can consider ( fig . [",
    "fig : fourboxes ] ) .",
    "alice and bob can possess @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively , charlie is given two boxes either both @xmath2 or both @xmath3 , and the task is to determine which boxes charlie has .",
    "we can also consider the case in which alice and bob possess @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively and charlie is given two unlabelled boxes , say @xmath96 and @xmath97 , guaranteed that either @xmath98 and @xmath99 or vice versa , and our task is to determine the order in which @xmath2 and @xmath3 appear .",
    "for this task , we will also consider the case where the reference boxes that alice and bob are given are either both @xmath2 or both @xmath3 .",
    "let us consider the case of alice having box @xmath2 , bob box @xmath3 , and charlie a pair of identical boxes , both of which are @xmath2 or @xmath3 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fourboxes]a ) .",
    "a good strategy here is to use four qubits in the form of two singlet states , @xmath100 and apply the boxes .",
    "if both boxes @xmath96 and @xmath97 are @xmath3 , then the output state is @xmath101 and if both @xmath96 and @xmath97 are @xmath2 , then we have @xmath102 if we now average over both @xmath2 and @xmath3 , we obtain the possible output density operators @xmath103 between which we must distinguish .",
    "let us first consider unambiguous discrimination .",
    "the best povm elements are @xmath104 where @xmath91 is associated with the failure outcome .",
    "we find that , as is necessary , @xmath105 , and that @xmath106 .",
    "with both situations being equally likely , our overall success probability is then @xmath68 .    for minimum - error discrimination , we always need a result ; the measurement is not allowed to fail .",
    "this means that we have to do something with the operators appearing in @xmath91 .",
    "we first note that the outcome corresponding to @xmath107 never occurs , so it can be added to either @xmath89 or @xmath90 without any effect .",
    "the outcome corresponding to @xmath108 can occur , and for either density matrix does so with a probability @xmath109 .",
    "when it does , we have no idea which density matrix we have , so we have to guess .",
    "one way of guessing is that we can always guess @xmath57 , and we shall be wrong half the time .",
    "this corresponds to adding @xmath110 to @xmath90 .",
    "( for equal prior probabilities of @xmath26 and @xmath25 , it does not matter how we guess , but if the probabilities are unequal , we should always guess the more likely one . )",
    "therefore , for minimum - error discrimination we can choose for our povm operators @xmath111 and the probability of error will be @xmath41 .",
    "we now turn our attention to a variant of our decision problem in which the object is to determine which box corresponds to which operator .",
    "charlie has two boxes @xmath96 and @xmath97 , and either box @xmath96 performs @xmath2 and box @xmath97 performs @xmath3 , or vice versa . our object is to determine which of these two situations holds .",
    "this version of the problem is sometimes equivalent to the version with one unknown box considered in previous sections .",
    "for example , if in addition to charlie s boxes , there is only one program box @xmath2 , we now have to distinguish between @xmath112 and @xmath113 . as we are averaging over @xmath2 and @xmath3 , we can however interchange these in the second density matrix , so that @xmath114 becomes @xmath115 .",
    "this scenario is equivalent , therefore , to the third box being unlabelled , with one reference box each of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "all the strategies we have discussed above that apply to this three - box situation can therefore be carried over to the order - finding version .",
    "it remains , therefore , to consider the four - box situations , in which alice and bob both have reference boxes ..      in the case in which alice and bob both have the same reference box , say @xmath2 , and charlie has either @xmath98 and @xmath99 , or vice versa ( ( fig . [",
    "fig : fourboxes]b ) ) , we can map this case directly onto the case in section  [ twotwosame ] .",
    "we note that the two possibilities for @xmath116 are either @xmath117 or @xmath118 . as we have to average over all possible @xmath2 and @xmath3 , this is equivalent to trying to distinguish between @xmath119 and @xmath120 where we have simply re - ordered the boxes ( @xmath121 ) and interchanged @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the second case .",
    "one might wonder if replacing one of the @xmath2 operators by a @xmath3 in this scheme would improve the results .",
    "that is , suppose that bob has a box that performs @xmath3 instead of @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fourboxes]c ) .",
    "if box @xmath96 is @xmath2 and box @xmath97 is @xmath3 , then we now have the state @xmath122 and if box @xmath96 is @xmath3 and box @xmath97 is @xmath2 , we have @xmath123 we average these two states over @xmath2 and @xmath3 giving us the two density matrices @xmath124 in comparing these two density matrices , it is useful to express @xmath125 as latexmath:[\\[|\\psi\\rangle_{abc_1c_2 } = \\frac{1}{2 } ( |\\psi^+\\rangle_{bc_1}|\\psi^+\\rangle_{ac_2 } +     of @xmath55 is contained in the support of @xmath57 , so that if we are considering unambiguous discrimination , we will be able to positively identify @xmath57 , but we will never be able to positively identify @xmath55 .",
    "we choose @xmath90 , the povm element corresponding to @xmath57 , to be the sum of three projection operators .",
    "the first is the projection onto the part of @xmath127 that is orthogonal to the vector @xmath128 the second is the projection onto @xmath129 , and the third is the projection onto @xmath130 .",
    "the notation here is that @xmath131 is the symmetric subspace of qubits @xmath132 and @xmath133 , while @xmath134 is the antisymmetric subspace of qubits @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "the povm element corresponding to failure is @xmath135 .",
    "we find that @xmath136 , which means the our overall success rate is @xmath137 ; we succeed with a probability of @xmath138 if we have @xmath57 , which happens with a probability of @xmath139 , and we get an indeterminate answer if we are given @xmath55 .",
    "we have found that replacing one of the @xmath2 operators by @xmath3 has made the situation worse .",
    "this makes sense as detecting a difference in either the pair @xmath140 or @xmath141 will identify the order of @xmath2 and @xmath3 for boxes @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "if we match up identical operations in both singlet pairs , then we have no chance of unambiguously identifying the order of boxes @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "matching different transforms up in both pairs gives a higher probability to detect a difference , as opposed to when there is a difference in only one singlet pair .",
    "this can not , however , make up for our inability to detect a difference when identical transforms were matched up .",
    "it may be that in this situation , a strategy with more than four qubits would help .",
    "this is because the situation is somewhat similar to the three - box situation in section  [ nonpairwise ] .",
    "there , we would like to compare the unlabelled box against a reference box which does not match it , in order to unambiguously identify the unlabelled box .",
    "we can not know which reference box to choose , however , and half the time we will choose to compare the unlabelled box against an identical reference box .",
    "the four - qubit strategy somehow helps us beat the odds . here",
    ", we would like to compare both unlabelled boxes with reference boxes which do not match , but half the time we make the wrong choice and match the unlabelled boxes up with matching reference boxes . a strategy with more qubits might do better , but",
    "this is still an open problem .",
    "we have discussed a number of operator decision problems . in each",
    "we are set the task of determining whether boxes perform the same or different unitary transformations , @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "we have no prior information of the forms of the transformations , but , instead , we have reference boxes that are known to perform the transformations @xmath2 or @xmath3 .    we began by considering one reference box and one unknown box .",
    "this situation reduced to operator comparison , and for both unambiguous discrimination and minimum - error discrimination it is best to send into each box one of the particles from a singlet state .",
    "we then went on to examine the situation where one has two reference boxes and one unknown box .",
    "this can be thought of as a kind of pattern matching .",
    "each of the reference operators represents a pattern , and we are trying to determine which of the two patterns the unknown operator matches .",
    "we studied both unambiguous and minimum - error strategies based on pairwise operator comparison .",
    "we also studied a minimum - error strategy based on an entangled three - qubit state that best approximates two singlet states .",
    "this strategy was not as good as pairwise operator comparison .",
    "using subspace discrimination , we found an unambiguous strategy that is better than pairwise operator comparison , which demonstrates that the pairwise comparison strategy is not optimal .",
    "finally , we studied situations with two reference boxes and two unknown boxes .",
    "for these cases , we only studied strategies based on pairwise operator comparison .",
    "our objective was not to present a comprehensive theory of operator comparison problems , but to to gain some idea of the issues involved and to present some strategies that will work for specific problems .",
    "one conclusion is that pairwise operator comparison works well , but is not always optimal .",
    "finding optimal strategies is a subject that deserves further study .",
