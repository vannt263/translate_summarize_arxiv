    "( 1961 ) described ss  lac as an eclipsing binary of 14.4 days period , with significant eccentricity because the equal depth secondary eclipse occurred at phase 0.57 .",
    "however , more recent observations by zakirov & azimov ( 1990 ) , lacy ( 1992 ) , mossakovskaya ( 1993 ) and schiller et al . ( 1996 ) show that the eclipses no longer occur .",
    "the end of the eclipsing phase is set around 1940 by mossakovskaya ( 1993 ) and around 1960 by lehmann ( 1991 ) .",
    "the latter ascribes the rotation of the plane of the orbit to the presence of an unseen third body in the system , orbiting at a great distance the closer central pair .",
    "quite puzzling has been the report by schiller et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and schiller & milone ( 1996 ) that 1983 - 84 spectra of ss  lac did not reveal the expected double  lined nature of the spectra .",
    "very little , if any , variation in radial velocity was observed . using available predictions for the rate of change of the ss  lac orbital inclination , schiller & milone ( 1996 ) expected a semi - amplitude of the radial velocity curve of 150 km sec@xmath0 , far in excess of their instrumental resolution .",
    "they suggested that ss  lac could be a triple system suddenly become chaotic or that a close encounter with another ngc 7209 member could have ionized the binary ( cf .",
    "schiller 1996 ) .    stimulated by the schiller et al .",

    "( 1996 ) , stefanik et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and etzel & volgenau ( 1996 ) announced in iau circulars that , according to their preliminary spectroscopic observations , ss  lac is a double  lined system , with indications of variability in the radial velocities .",
    "so far no investigation of the orbital motion of ss  lac has appeared in literature .    as an ex - eclipsing binary in a well populated young open cluster ,",
    "ss  lac clearly deserved further investigations to clarify the whole issue . in this note",
    "we report about our spectroscopic monitoring of ss  lac performed to the aim of confirming the binary nature and to derive the spectroscopic orbit .",
    "twenty - four echelle+ccd spectra of ss  lac have been obtained with the asiago 1.82 m telescope during 1997 .",
    "they cover the range from 4300 to 6600 with a resolution of @xmath122,500 at h@xmath2 ( from the fwhm of comparison spectrum thorium lines ) .",
    "the spectra have been reduced in a standard way with the iraf software package .",
    "a sample of h@xmath3 profiles recorded on our spectra is shown in figure  1 , where the periodic splitting and merging of the individual components is evident .",
    "on our spectra we measured only the radial velocities of the h@xmath3 , h@xmath2 and h@xmath4 lines ( the latter over two distinct echelle orders ) .",
    "a few other metallic lines were indeed visible , but too weak for meaningful measurements .",
    "the radial velocities reported in table  1 come from the hydrogen lines , weighted according to the s / n of the stellar continuum around the line ( typically 6:4:3 for h@xmath3:h@xmath2:h@xmath4 , with an average s / n=5060 around h@xmath3 ) .",
    "our observations were secured over a time span covering less than 8 revolutions of ss  lac and therefore are not suited for a very accurate period determination .",
    "a deeming - fourier analysis of data in table  1 suggests a period of 14.4@xmath50.3 days , very close to the 14.416 days determined from eclipse timing by several authors ( e.g. brancewicz & dworak 1980 ) . in the computation of the orbit , the period 14.41638 from eq.(2 ) has been adopted ( see below ) .",
    "the orbital solution is given in table  2 .",
    "with the exception of @xmath6 and eccentricity , the formal errors for the other elements are @xmath71.5% , with a weighted deviation of the observations from the computed orbit of @xmath80.8 km sec@xmath0 . the solution is graphically presented in figure  2 .",
    "it is worth to compare the photometric and spectroscopic orbital solutions ( cf .",
    "savedoff 1951 ) through the combination of the eccentricity ( @xmath9 ) and longitude of the periastron ( @xmath6 ) elements ( cf .",
    "struve 1948 ) : @xmath10 the photometric value is + 0.110 ( dugan & wright 1935 ) , very close to the + 0.108 value from the spectroscopic orbital solution in table  2 ( and orbital inclination from sect .",
    "thus the photometric and spectroscopic orbital solutions appear in excellent agreement .",
    ".heliocentric radial velocities of the ss  lac components . solid line and filled circles in figure  2 refer to star @xmath11 .",
    "the quoted errors are probable errors .",
    "when the two components were too close in radial velocity for line splitting into individual components , a single value is given ( central column ) .",

    ". a discussion of this hypothesis is beyond the scopes of the present paper .",
    "we may however point out that in our spectra when the balmer lines show a clear split and the s / n ratio is high , a weak absorption is visible .",
    "the h@xmath3 component does not correspond to known telluric absorptions in this region , and the coincidence between the various balmer lines favour an interpretation as a _ real _ stellar line . to the benefit of future investigators of ss  lac we report in table  3 the heliocentric velocity of this weak component as measured on our spectra ( same weighting as described in sect.2 ) ,",
