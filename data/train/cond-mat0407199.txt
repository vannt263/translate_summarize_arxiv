    "the position of the gap - like feature shifts down discontinuously in increasing fields around 9 t and in decreasing fields around 5 t .",
    "we argue that these shifts are due to nodal surface currents induced by the applied field , with the field itself , possibly inducing a certain modification of the vortex state .",
    "no transition is observed when the field is parallel to the @xmath4 planes ( fig .",

    "the magnetic field splitting of the zero bias conductance peak was previously addressed @xcite .",
    "we focus here on the field dependence of the gap - like feature at high bias .",
    "it shows a progressive , roughly linear , shift of the peak position from  17 mev to  15 mev as the field increases from 0 to 1 t .",
    "this initial decrease is followed by a flat region up to 6 t .",
    "if that field is not exceed and then reversed a hysteresis loop is described ending up with a flat region at low field .",
    "if the field is increased above 6 t the gap - like feature amplitude starts to shrink until , at 8 t , it ca nt be identified anymore . in the range of 8 to 11 t",
    "a flat maximum develops between 10 and 15 mev .",
    "an 11 mev peak builds up with the field and is clearly identified above 11 t . up to a field of 16 t ,",
    "no detectable smearing of this peak occurs .    reducing the field from values larger than 11 t has another interesting effect .",
    "the 11 mev peak gradually shifts back to 14 mev as the field is reduced by about 1 t , for example from 15 to 14 t ( fig .",
    "3 ) or from 32.4 to 31.5 t ( fig .",
    "in contrast to the 9 t field up transition , the shift back to 14 mev is _ continuous _ , which shows that the new peak at 11 mev is indeed a new gap like feature rather than being related for instance to the split zero - bias conductance peak . by further reducing the field , the 14 mev peak shrinks while the 16 mev builds up below 5 t ( fig .",
    "an analogous behavior is seen under field cooled conditions ( fig .",
    "the overall variation of the gap - like feature peak position with respect to the applied field can be seen in fig .",
    "the jump in its position can be clearly observed in increasing fields above 8 t and decreasing fields lower than 6 t .",

    "the rapid change in the peak position upon field reversal ( figs",
    ". 3 , 4b ) means that its position is affected by field induced currents .",
    "the strong difference between ( 100 ) and ( 110 ) oriented films , both showing a similar gap - like feature , presumably due to surface roughness @xcite , indicates that these currents flow over a depth much larger than the surface roughness ( few tens of nm ) .",
    "the bean - livingston barrier @xcite can prevent the entry of vortices up to fields of the order of the thermodynamical critical field , @xmath9 ( @xmath10 t for ybco ) .",
    "the rapid initial decrease of the gap - like feature peak position from 16 mev down to 14 mev over that field range can be due to the delayed vortex entrance ( see fig .",
    "we name the corresponding currents surface vortex currents , @xmath11 .",
    "this is confirmed by the low field hysteresis loop , as there is no bean - livingston barrier in decreasing fields .",
    "this initial decrease is not observed in ( 100 ) oriented films where the currents at the surface flow along an anti - nodal direction .",
    "this decrease is therefore clearly due to nodal currents . the major question raised here concerns however the origin of the 11 mev peak seen in increasing fields above 10 t .",
    "it could be a current effect , or a field effect , or a combination of both .",
    "in addition to the vortex surface currents , @xmath12 , one should also consider the meissner screening current , @xmath13 , and the bean current @xmath14 due to vortices pinned in the bulk .",
    "we showed @xcite that by measuring the difference between field cooled and decreasing field splitting values of the zero bias conductance peak ( also due to the surface currents @xcite ) , one can estimate the bean critical current value .",

    "@xmath24 we have @xmath25 and @xmath26 : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is london s penetration depth .",

    "we emphasize that the contributions of @xmath12 , @xmath39 and @xmath17 may all be important for the interpretation of the experiment .",

    "( a ) decreasing fields from 16 t .",

    "note that the intermediate field peak conductance is lower than both the high and low field ones . ]",
    "we note that the progressive enhancement of the 11mev peak in increasing fields ( fig .",
    "6 ) suggests a transition to a new superconducting state .",
    "any continuous reduction of the _ d_-wave gap would not be accompanied by an enhancement of its gap - like feature peak amplitude .",
    "the new superconducting phase could be a different vortex state @xcite , in such case the transition would be basically field induced . alternatively , the new phase could appear due to strong nodal currents and possibly have an order parameter with a symmetry different from a pure @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "a general difficulty in comparing our data to existing theories is that they have addressed only the small current limit @xcite .",
    "we can only offer some speculations as to what a high current phase might be . in a previous publication @xcite we discussed the zero bias conductance peak field splitting in terms of a field - induced @xmath41 component .",
    "but we have found no correlation between the zero bias conduction peak splitting and the gap like feature position implying that their origins are different .",
    "for instance , after decreasing the field from 16 to 15 t , the position of the gap - like feature remains unchanged down to 5 t ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , but the zero - bias conductance peak splitting reduce from 4.2 to 2.5 mev ( see fig.4 in ref .",
    "we speculate that surface currents on the coherence length scale could split the zero bias peak , @xcite but , as shown here , only currents on much larger length scale are affecting the position of the gap like feature position .",
    "the fact that we observe a regime where two gap features coexist , both in increasing and decreasing fields as well as in field cooled conditions , with a definite hysteresis , suggests a first order transition showing superheating and supercooling effects . to be specific , following the position and amplitude of the gap - like feature as a function of applied field we observed that the transition from low to high fields state takes place at 9 t ( superheating ) and back from the high to low fields at 5 t ( supercooling ) .",
    "whatever the high current - high field phase is , it is clear that it has the effect of reducing the density of low lying states , and this well beyond the field - current where the zero bias conductance peak has disappeared ( fig .",
    "a transition to an inhomogeneous state in the case of nodal currents was recently speculated about by khavkine _ et .",
    "we also note that in very high fields the vortices nearest to the surface are located within a few coherence lengths , which may affect the tunneling conductance @xcite .",
    "a different explanation to the data would be that the remarkable change in the tunneling conductance at 9 t in increasing fields is a vortex state transition e.g. bragg to votex glass @xcite .",
    "such a transition is known to be irreversible as observed .",
    "the new vortex state could modify the pinning and hence the total nodal current or its effect on the order parameter .",
    "this could explain the large hysteresis observed at high fields .",
    "however , in contradiction to the high bias region , the low bias region which is also sensitive to total current via the doppler shift mechanism , @xcite does not show substantial hysteresis .     11 mev gap - like feature peak amplitude of sample 2 for increasing fields .",
    "the enhancement up to 20 t suggests that the high fields state has a stronger coherence peak . ]",
    "in conclusion , we have observed a remarkable change in the tunneling conductance in high magnetic fields in ybco ( 110 ) oriented films .",
    "a transition of the gap - like feature position and amplitude is present in both increasing and decreasing fields and under field cooled conditions for fields oriented parallel to the surface and perpendicular to the @xmath4 planes in such a way as to induce currents along nodal directions .",
    "we have proposed that the observed transition may be induced by these currents . in the high current state ,",
    "the density of low energy states is reduced , possibly indicating the emergence of a component of the order parameter leading towards a fully gaped state .",
    "alternatively , the changes in the tunneling characteristics may be due to a transition between two vortex states , having different gap values and sensitivity to nodal currents .",
