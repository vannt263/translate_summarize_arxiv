    "observations of high - redshift absorbers along the lines - of - sight to distant qsos reveal nearly unprocessed primordial gas . in a handful of such systems",
    "there is evidence for deuterium ; the inferred abundance may be very nearly the primordial value .",
    "for two high - z , low - z systems tytler and collaborators ( tytler , fan & burles 1996 , burles & tytler 1996 ) derive low deuterium abundances , d / h = ( 2.4@xmath0 , similar to those inferred from observations of the local interstellar medium ( linsky et al .",
    "1993 , linsky 1998 ) .",
    "such low values have been challenged by songaila et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , who suggest a larger deuterium abundance , d / h @xmath1 , for one of the burles & tytler ( 1996 ) absorbers .",
    "in contrast , deuterium abundances nearly an order of magnitude higher , d / h = ( 19@xmath2 , have been claimed by carswell et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , songaila et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and by rugers & hogan ( 1996 ) for other high - redshift systems with metal abundances equally close to primordial .",
    "however , using better data obtained for one of these systems , tytler , burles & kirkman ( 1997 ) find no evidence for deuterium and exclude the published ( high ) abundance at the  10@xmath3 \" level . nonetheless , hogan ( 1997 and private communication ) ,",
    "wampler ( 1996 and private communication ) and songaila ( 1997 ) argue that the spectra of other absorbing systems require high d / h ( e.g. , webb et al .",
    "the high - d , low - d dispute awaits more data for its resolution .    even though these qso absorbers have very low metal abundances , suggesting very little stellar activity , their d content must still be considered only a lower limit to the primordial deuterium abundance , ( d / h)@xmath4 , since d is only destroyed by stellar processes subsequent to big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "to reconcile the current low abundance of d inferred from observations of the local interstellar medium ( ism ) , ( d / h)@xmath5 ( linsky et al . 1993 ) , with a primordial value as large as that suggested by hogan and collaborators requires that deuterium has been destroyed by an order of magnitude , or more , in the course of the evolution of the galaxy .",
    "although such high abundances are now strongly challenged observationally , it is still important to investigate whether any chemical evolution scenarios exist which permit large d - destruction factors and , if so , how their predictions compare with the available observational constraints on the distribution  in space and in time  of the abundances of the other elements .",
    "as summarized by tosi ( 1996 and references therein ) , those models for the evolution of the disk of our galaxy which are in agreement with the largest set of available observational constraints predict that deuterium has been depleted by less than a factor of three . thus , to reproduce the abundances , by mass , observed in the solar system , x@xmath6 and in the local interstellar medium , x@xmath7 ( geiss 1993 ; linsky et al .",
    "1993 , respectively ) , none of these _ good , standard _ models would allow initial deuterium abundances higher than x@xmath8 .",
    "such a low upper bound to primordial d is much lower than the value , x@xmath9 , suggested by rugers & hogan ( 1996 , hereinafter rh ) . in all the models considered by tosi ( 1996 ) : carigi ( 1996 ) , chiappini & matteucci ( 1996 ) , dearborn , steigman & tosi ( 1996 , hereinafter dst ) , galli et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , prantzos ( 1996 ) , those with large initial deuterium either can not fit the d - abundances observed in the solar system and/or in the local ism , or can not account for the presently observed amount of disk gas and/or the abundances of the heavier elements . although other models designed to permit higher d - destruction have been proposed ( e.g. vangioni - flam & audouze 1988 ; vangioni - flam , olive & prantzos 1994 ; olive et al .",
    "1995 ; scully et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 ) , in general they have not always been tested against all the available observational constraints and their self - consistency has been questioned ( e.g. edmunds 1994 , prantzos 1996 ) .    to investigate if it is possible to avoid this apparent inconsistency ( high primordial d , low galactic d ) , we have pursued two distinct approaches .",
    "on the one hand , we have developed a series of general ( i.e. , model - independent ) arguments along the line of reasoning described by steigman & tosi ( 1995 ) , and , on the other hand , we have actually computed the evolution predicted for several specific , albeit _ ad hoc _ , models for the halo and the disk of the galaxy which were designed to maximize d - destruction .",
    "the evolution of deuterium after bbn is straightforward since , when incorporated in a star , it is completely destroyed , burned to @xmath10he during the pre - main sequence evolution . if the  virgin \" fraction of the ism ( either now or at the time of the formation of the solar system ) were known , the primordial ( pre - galactic ) d - abundance could be inferred directly from ism or solar system observations . the more material cycled through stars , the more d - destruction , and vice - versa . but , the more material cycled through stars , the more heavy elements are synthesized and the more mass is tied up in unevolved low mass stars and in stellar remnants . efficient d - destruction and efficient star formation go hand - in - hand .",
    "thus , there is the possibility that the observed metallicity and/or the disk gas - fraction may be exploited to constrain the deuterium depletion factor in a manner insensitive to the details of specific models of galactic evolution .",
    "we explore one such approach below ; see steigman & tosi ( 1995 ) for an alternate approach .",
    "consider a  representative \" sample of the ism .",
    "some fraction ( by mass ) of that material , @xmath11 , will have never been through stars . in this",
    " virgin \" fraction the deuterium is primordial ( x@xmath12 x@xmath13 ) , and there are no metals ( z = 0 ) .",
    "the remainder of the material will have been through one or more generations of stars which destroyed all the deuterium ( x@xmath14 = 0 ) , but which did produce some heavy elements .",
    "for example , in a fraction @xmath15 , which has been through one ( and only one ) generation of stars , there will be no deuterium but there are some heavy elements . estimating the metallicity of this  one - generation \" fraction is complicated",
    ". some of the matter may be from long - lived , low - mass stars formed long ago and some may be from short - lived , high - mass stars formed very recently .",
    "thus , the gas returned to the ism will have come from a mixture of stars of all masses , including the very low - mass ones which destroy deuterium but do not contribute much to the enhancement of the heavy element abundances and the higher - mass stars which destroy deuterium and do enhance the galactic metallicity . in this manner",
    "the average metallicity ( @xmath16 ) of this one - generation sub - sample is a mean , weighted by the initial mass function ( imf ) .    generalizing the above description to material which has been through 2 , 3 ,",
    "... generations of stars ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , ... ) , we may relate the deuterium and heavy element mass fractions as follows :    @xmath19    @xmath20    @xmath21    as they stand , these relations are not very useful .",
    "however , if there exists a lower bound ( @xmath22 ) to all the @xmath23 ( @xmath22 @xmath24 @xmath23 ) , eq .",
    "( 2 ) can be rewritten as :    @xmath25    or , @xmath26 so that , @xmath27    equations ( 4 - 6 ) summarize , in a compact form , the anticipated connections : the more material cycled through stars , the higher will be the metallicity and the more will deuterium have been destroyed .",
    "thus , the present ( ism or presolar ) value of @xmath28 , supplemented with an estimate of @xmath22 , may be used to provide a bound on @xmath11 and , therefore , on x@xmath13 . to implement this approach ,",
    "we have chosen oxygen as a good tracer of the total metallicity , and to estimate @xmath22 we have computed the contribution to the metallicity from a single stellar population ; @xmath22 @xmath29 min(@xmath30 ) , where :    @xmath31    @xmath32 is the total mass ejected by stars of mass @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the mass ejected in the form of newly synthesized oxygen and @xmath35 is the imf .",
    "the oxygen enrichment provided by one generation of stars thus depends on the stellar nucleosynthesis yields we have adopted , and on the imf through its slope ( @xmath36 ) and upper ( @xmath37 ) and lower ( @xmath38 ) mass limits .    to explore the uncertainties traceable to stellar yields we have computed @xmath16 adopting both the minimum and the maximum oxygen yields from the literature ( chiosi & caimmi 1979 , hereinafter cc79 , and woosley & weaver 1995 , ww95 , respectively ) .",
    "similarly , for the imf we have chosen the two most extreme popular slopes appropriate for the range of massive stars which produce oxygen : @xmath36 = 3.3 as in tinsley ( 1980 ) and @xmath36 = 2.35 as in the extrapolation of the salpeter imf ( 1955 ) ; we allow both @xmath37 and @xmath38 to vary .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ imf ] shows the behaviour of the  virgin \" fraction , @xmath39 , as a function of the lower mass limit ( @xmath38 ) to the imf ( with @xmath37 = 100 ) , for oxygen yields taken from ww95 ( dotted line ) and from cc79 ( solid line ) respectively .",
    "the imf is tinsley s ( 1980 ) and we adopt for the local oxygen abundance at the time the solar system formed : @xmath40 ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) .",
    "we have explored all combinations of the parameters and find for the minimum of the one - generation yield , @xmath41 = 0.012 . using this value for @xmath22",
    "we conclude that the fraction of gas which has never been through stars is @xmath42 .",
    "this suggests ( see eq .",
    "1 ) that under  normal \" conditions ( standard yields , reasonable imfs ) , deuterium can not be destroyed by more than a factor of 5 .    this upper bound to d - destruction is clearly sensitive to our choices of @xmath41 and of @xmath43 . to obtain an extreme upper bound",
    "we have been careful to adopt those values for both quantities which permit the maximum d - depletion .",
    "the anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) estimate of the solar metallicity is quite robust .",
    "although the sun may not provide a fair sample of the local ism 4.5 gyr ago , its abundance may , instead , provide an upper bound to the metallicity of the local ism at that epoch since the sun appears to be more metal - rich than the average of the local stars of its age .",
    "indeed , if the average local metallicity when the solar nebula collapsed were similar to , or even lower than that derived from orion and the local regions , i.e. , 0.2 dex lower than @xmath43 , our upper bound on d - destruction will be reduced . as for @xmath41 ,",
    "our bound is derived from those theoretical yields in the literature with the lowest o - production and using the imf for the local region with smallest fraction of massive stars ( i.e. , of oxygen producers ) . for these reasons",
    "we regard a factor of five as a robust upper bound to possible d - destruction .",
    "our bound on d - destruction is general in the sense that it is independent of the details of specific chemical evolution models ; the only inputs are from the imf and the stellar yields",
    ". however , it is key that the amount of deuterium destruction and the metallicity are linked through our assumption that all the stellar ejecta do contribute to the enrichment of the ism",
    ". this will be the case in the absence of winds capable of removing from the galaxy part or all of the stellar ejecta .",
    "in contrast , this d - destruction / metallicity connection may be avoided if winds , perhaps triggered by the explosions of multiple supernovae as originally suggested by larson ( 1974 ) for elliptical galaxies , were present earlier in the evolution of the galaxy . in the extreme case of the total removal ( permanently ! ) from the galaxy of all the ejecta of stars more massive than a given mass ,",
    "the effect of such a wind on the oxygen enrichment in the ism is equivalent to cutting off the imf at a value of @xmath37 equal to that mass .",
    "such an effect is illustrated in the bottom panel of figure  [ imf ] for two choices of @xmath38 ( 0.8and 5 ) .",
    "for the ww95 yields there remains a very tight constraint from the connection between metallicity and d - destruction , while the cc79 yields permit much more destruction .    as noted by pagel ( private communication )",
    ", there is another way in which the d - destruction / metallicity connection may be weakened : black hole formation .",
    "if all stars with @xmath44 collapse without returning any newly synthesized material to the ism , the average yield per stellar generation will be reduced .",
    "the effect of this , too , may be inferred from the bottom panel of figure  [ imf ] ; from the point of view of chemical enrichment , it is equivalent to the material from such stars being expelled from the galaxy via winds .",
    "there are two potential problems associated with too small a value of @xmath45 or , equivalently , with winds which effectively cut off the imf above @xmath37 . in both cases",
    "the oxygen yield is more strongly reduced than the helium yield so that the effect is to increase their ratio , @xmath46y/@xmath46z ( maeder 1992 ) .",
    "hg et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and thuan & izotov ( 1998 ) argue that @xmath46y/@xmath46z @xmath24 3 . from figure 15 in maeder ( 1992 ) , for the scalo ( 1986 ) imf , we infer that to satisfy this limit requires @xmath47 55 . since for our  robust \" bound we use tinsley s ( 1980 ) imf which has fewer massive stars than scalo s ( 1986 ) , according to maeder s ( 1992 ) arguments the lower limit to @xmath45 must be even larger . as a result , ( assuming @xmath48 ) even with the cc79 yields there is a limit on @xmath11 ( see figure  [ imf ] ) .",
    "thus , depending on the actual yields ( cc79 or ww95 ) and on the appropriate lower mass limit @xmath38 , limits to @xmath46y/@xmath46z provide bounds on deuterium destruction in the presence of winds and/or black hole formation .",
    "another constraint on mass loss or black hole formation comes from the observed gas fraction which will decrease if significant mass is removed from the ism , leaving more mass locked into long - lived stars and/or stellar remnants ( edmunds 1994 ) .",
    "thus , although winds and/or black hole formation are promising avenues to pursue if the d - destruction / metallicity connection is to be weakened , there are still some observational constraints which must be satisfied .",
    "these general results serve as a guide , permitting us to identify potentially fruitful approaches to designing chemical evolution models which , while destroying significant amounts of deuterium , may avoid exhausting the interstellar gas and/or overproducing the heavy elements . with standard imfs and no significant winds",
    ", large d - destruction requires that so much mass has been cycled through stars that the observed metallicity would be exceeded .",
    "this d - destruction / metallicity connection may be broken , for example , by adopting a nonstandard imf biased against high - mass stars which are the main oxygen producers .",
    "although this will allow more gas to be cycled through stars , destroying deuterium while avoiding overproducing oxygen , at present there is currently no significant evidence for an anomalous imf ( wyse 1997 ) . alternatively , as suggested by vangioni - flam & cass ( 1995 ) and by scully et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , the offending metals might have been removed by strong winds . since there is no good evidence for variations of the imf ( e.g. richer & fahlman 1996 , wyse 1997 ) we will pursue the latter approach in our search for specific galactic evolution models which may be capable of destroying deuterium efficiently while preserving consistency with the observational data .",
    "to explore in detail whether galactic winds and/or infall of d - depleted gas may lead to observationally consistent models which permit high d - destruction , we have computed a series of numerical chemical evolution models including such winds .",
    "we describe these models below and compare their predictions with the observational data available for our galaxy . in following the evolution of the elements produced mainly by long - lived stars , such as @xmath10he , @xmath49n and @xmath50fe ,",
    "it is of fundamental importance that the instantaneous recycling approximation is avoided .",
    "bearing in mind that the initial disk abundance , x@xmath51 , may not necessarily be the primordial one , x@xmath13 , we consider two possible scenarios :    \\a ) for the _ good , standard _ models summarized by tosi ( 1996 ) , fitting the observed ism d - abundance constrains the initial disk deuterium abundance to be x@xmath51 @xmath52 , in contrast to the rh primordial value of x@xmath13 = x@xmath53 . in this case",
    "most of the d - destruction must have occurred prior to disk formation .",
    "therefore , in this case the disk must form out of already processed gas .",
    "this requires either that an unknown ( and improbable ) mechanism burned most of the primordial d prior to galaxy formation ( without producing a significant metallicity ) , or that most of the destruction must have taken place during the halo phase .",
    "this latter hypothesis assumes that the disk formed out of gas shed from the halo which is in disagreement with recent observational results ( ibata & gilmore 1995 ; see the discussions in chiappini et al .",
    "1997a and in pagel & tautvaisiene 1995 ) .",
    "\\b ) if the initial disk abundance is , instead , x@xmath54x@xmath55 , it is necessary to invoke a much larger d consumption during disk evolution to deplete the deuterium abundance down to the observed solar system and local ism values .",
    "this , however , requires a much larger early star formation rate ( sfr ) which , in turn , as we ve seen in our general considerations above , would lead to excessive metal enrichment ( see e.g. vangioni - flam & audouze 1988 ) .",
    "these conclusions may possibly be evaded if the evolution includes the effect of strong galactic winds ( see e.g. scully et al .",
    "1997 ) and/or the infall of d - depleted gas . in any case",
    ", a very high initial sfr in the disk violates the constraint that the peak sfr can only be a factor of a few larger than the present sfr ( e.g. , twarog 1980 , prantzos 1998 ) .    during the early halo phase ,",
    "if the sfr were much higher , so too would have been the rate of supernova explosions , perhaps triggering strong winds .",
    "in contrast , strong winds are highly improbable at present in the disk of our galaxy ( except perhaps in its outer layers ) where both the gravitational potential and the gas density are likely too high to allow the gas to reach escape velocity ( spitzer 1990 , tenorio - tagle 1996 ) .",
    "fountains ( i.e. , gas leaving the disk temporarily but returning later somewhere in the disk ) may occur , but they wo nt remove the metals permanently . before considering models with strong , early winds we first explore the effects of infall .",
    "infall generally has the effect of raising the disk d - abundance towards the primordial value .",
    "it is difficult to avoid this conclusion since it has been shown , both theoretically ( tosi 1988b , matteucci & franois 1989 , hereinafter mf ) and observationally ( e.g. savage & de boer 1981 ) that the infalling gas has a metallicity of , at most , 0.20.3@xmath56 .",
    "therefore , it is quite unlikely that all the deuterium in the infalling gas has been destroyed . for the sake of completeness , however , we have revisited the broad range of models described in dst and in tosi ( 1988a ) , allowing for arbitrarily low d / h in the infalling gas .",
    "the predictions for the local evolution of deuterium in one representative set of these models ( see dst and tosi 1988a for the model assumptions and parameters ) , which displays the key trends common to all such models , are shown in figure  [ dinf ] , together with the 2@xmath3 ranges of the abundances ( by mass ) derived from solar system and local ism observations .",
    "also shown in the figure are two models from dst : the solid line corresponds to model 1-t - vb [ sfr = exp(-t/15gyr ) ; infall f = 4@xmath57@xmath58 ; metallicity @xmath59 and the dotted line to the no infall model ( ni - z - iii ) .",
    "none of these models is capable of satisfactorily reconciling a large primordial abundance , x@xmath13 = x@xmath60 , with the observed pre - solar and local ism values .",
    "indeed , to reach the present ism value starting from such a high initial abundance requires nearly d - free infall , x@xmath61x@xmath13 ( long - dashed line ) , but then the d - abundance predicted for the solar system is larger than that observed .",
    "for the extreme choice , x@xmath62 = 0 ( short - dashed line ) , the solar abundance can be fitted , but then the predictions for the d - abundance at the present epoch are too low compared to those observed in the local ism .",
    "the best compromise is achieved by assuming x@xmath62 = 0.2x@xmath13 ( dash - dotted line ) which , however , corresponds to a maximum allowed primordial abundance , x@xmath63 ( ( d / h)@xmath64 ) , which , while large , is still lower than the rh value by a factor of 1.5 .",
    "even this case is not entirely realistic since _ standard _ models ( cf .",
    "tosi 1996 ) suggest that the metallicity will exceed solar in gas in which deuterium has been depleted by a factor of 5 .",
    "therefore d - depleted infalling gas will have high metallicity , while deuterium should be virtually undepleted in low metallicity infalling gas .",
    "the no - infall ( ni ) model ( dotted line ) actually predicts _ less _ d - destruction than even those models with infall of d - depleted gas .",
    "this is because to reproduce the current gas and total mass in the disk the ni models must have a lower sfr , leading to less d - consumption .",
    "unfortunately , the ni model and those with z@xmath65 z@xmath66 do not satisfy several important observational constraints such as the abundance gradients and the metallicity distribution of the g - dwarfs ( e.g. tosi 1988b , mf ) . besides",
    ", it would be quite improbable that the metallicity of the infalling material is higher than solar , since both the halo and the closest external galaxies ( lmc and smc ) are metal poor compared to the sun .",
    "thus , _ standard _ models with d - depleted infall fail to reconcile a high primordial abundance of deuterium with the observed solar system and ism values .",
    "next we study the effect of winds on the evolution of the galaxy halo and disk using models based on the  sequential \" models described by mf and the  two - infall \" models of chiappini , matteucci & gratton ( 1997a , hereinafter cmg ) which permit different choices of the star formation rate , of the imf and of the relative importance of winds .",
    "we have modified the ",
    "sequential \" models ( mf ) and the  two - infall \" models ( cmg ) by allowing the galaxy to lose mass through winds and we have explored the consequences for the destruction of deuterium , for the overall age - metallicity relation , for the variations of the ratios of abundances with the overall metallicity and for the metallicity distribution in old stars . before presenting our results we briefly describe the basic assumptions and parameters adopted for these models .      in these models ( see mf for details and specific parameter choices ) there is a continuity between the halo and disk evolution in the sense that the halo and the disk form as distinct phases of a unique process .",
    "the galactic disk is approximated by several independent rings , each 2 @xmath67 wide , without exchange of matter among them .",
    "continuous infall of gas ensures that the surface mass density in each ring increases with time .",
    "the star formation rate depends on the total surface mass density and on the surface gas density .",
    "the infall rate varies with galactocentric distance in such a way that the disk forms from the inside out .",
    "these models assume that the galaxy formed as a result of two main infall episodes . during the first one the halo and part of the thick disk formed ( some thick disk stars seem to have been accreted , as shown by gratton et al .",
    "1997 ) , whereas the second episode is responsible for the thin disk .",
    "the timescale for the formation of the halo and thick disk is quite short ( @xmath68 gyr ) whereas the timescale for the formation of the thin disk is quite long ( @xmath69 gyr ) suggesting that the thin disk formed mainly out of extragalactic primordial gas .",
    "this timescale ensures a very good fit to the new data on the g - dwarf metallicity distribution ( rocha - pinto & maciel 1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "the sfr is of the same form as in mf described above , except that a threshold in the surface gas density ( @xmath70 ) is assumed .",
    "when the gas density drops below this threshold , star formation stops .",
    "such a threshold has been suggested by some star formation studies ( kennicutt 1989 ) .    since the presence of a threshold leads naturally to a period between the first and the second infall episode where there is no active star formation , these models reproduce well the data in the most recent compilation by gratton et al .",
    "( 1997 ) which reveals the presence of a gap in star formation at the end of the thick - disk phase .",
    "the main advantage of the two - infall models is the decoupling between the rate of gas loss from the halo and that of gas infalling onto the disk .",
    "this allows a much longer timescale for disk evolution compared to that of the halo and thick disk phases .",
    "an important aspect of these models is that the threshold adopted in the star formation process limits star formation in the halo phase , allowing for the formation of stars with low - metallicity , as required by the observed metallicity distribution of halo stars .      for both the sequential models and the two - infall models",
    "there are many model parameters which may be varied . in probing the influence of winds , we assume that the mass - loss is proportional to the sfr and we can choose to utilize such winds either in the disk , the halo , or both .",
    "the relative importance of the winds is controlled by the ratio , w , of the mass - loss rate to the sfr ( see matteucci & tosi 1985 ) which we vary from 1.5 to 20 .",
    "furthermore , the winds can expell all the elements or only those produced by massive stars .",
    "considering the production sites of the most important elements , preferential loss of gas ejected by massive stars implies removal of most of the new oxygen ( which is only synthesized in massive stars ) , part of the carbon ( which is produced in both high and intermediate mass stars ) , a small part of the iron ( which is mostly produced by snei , with a small contribution from sneii ) and a negligible fraction of the nitrogen ( which is produced almost exclusively by intermediate mass stars ) .",
    "since such a wind will modify the element ratios predicted for halo stars , it is crucial to compare the model predictions with the available observational data on the _ relative _ abundances of the elements .    for the timescale of the sfr in the halo we have considered models with 0.1  0.2 gyr , while for that in the disk we ve allowed 1  2 gyr . for the formation timescale of the halo and for the disk we ve explored 0.03  8 gyr . we have allowed any infall to either be primordial ( @xmath71 ) or enriched ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "finally , we have experimented with several different imfs ( scalo 1986 ; scully et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 ) , including time - dependent cases ( padoan et al . 1997 ; chiappini et al . 1997b ; scully et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "we have run a very large number of models , both sequential and two - infall , varying all the above parameters in various combinations and we have identified the common characteristics as well as any significant differences .",
    "table 1 lists the adopted parameters for a significant sub - sample of the examined cases . in the next sections we choose three representative models to illustrate the behavior found for the sequential models and three for the two - infall models .",
    "our results for d - destruction and chemical evolution are shown in figures 3  7 .",
    "the results for three representative sequential models ( i , m , q ) are shown in figures 3 , 5 & 7 .",
    "model i uses the padoan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) imf while model q employs that of scalo ( 1986 ) . for model m",
    ", we adopt the metallicity - dependent imf from scully et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . with these models",
    "it is easy to achieve significant , even excessive , d - destruction , as seen in figure 3 . indeed ,",
    "many models of this type which we have investigated permit even more d - destruction than that shown for model i in figure 3 .",
    "however , these models encounter severe problems which are evident in figure 5 and in the lower panel of figure 7 . tuned to cycle gas through stars efficiently , so as to destroy primordial deuterium , these models predict excessive overabundances of oxygen and magnesium ( relative to iron ) at low metallicities .",
    "the g - dwarf metallicity distributions predicted by these models are orthogonal to those observed : high at low metallicity where the data are low , low at high metallicity where the data are high .",
    "this inconsistency in the predicted g - dwarf distribution compared to that observed may be overcome if it is assumed , _",
    "ad hoc _ , that the imf during the earliest epochs ( e.g. , the first 1 gyr , as in scully et al .",
    "1997 ) has no stars with mass below 2 m@xmath66 .",
    "however , we have always found in such cases that if the sfr is consistent with the observational constraints , the predicted metallicity of the oldest stars is excessive ( e.g. , despite the ameliorating effect of the wind , oxygen reaches solar abundance in the first 12 gyr ) . if , instead , we constrain the metallicity to remain within the observational range , we are forced to adopt a very low sfr , at least a factor of ten lower than the minimum presently observed local rate .    for the two - infall case we display the results of three representative models ( a , c , f ) in figures 4 , 6 & 7 . these models all assume infall of unprocessed ( primordial ) material .",
    "models a & c use the scalo ( 1986 ) imf while model f uses the padoan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) imf . for model c winds are very important ; the ratio of the mass - loss rate to the sfr is w = 20 .",
    "this is required in order to compensate for the overabundance of oxygen predicted by these models which all have a very high initial sfr .",
    "as seen in figure 4 , in these models the deuterium is destroyed rapidly during the first phase but restored during the second infall episode .",
    "thereafter , these two - infall models have only modest d - destruction . starting with a high initial abundance of deuterium",
    "there is no way these models can account for the relatively low abundances observed in the solar system or the present local ism . in figure 6 the predicted relative metallicities ( o / fe , mg / fe ,",
    "c / fe and n / fe ) , as a function of [ fe / h ] , are compared with the data . despite the large spread in the data , models",
    "a , c , & f provide a rather poor fit to the abundance ratios and are not in complete agreement with the observed g - dwarf metallicity distribution shown in the upper panel of figure 7 .",
    "although many two - infall models can be found which are consistent with the observed metallicities , all such models permit only modest d - destruction , by a factor which ranges from nearly unity ( infall compensating for stellar destruction ) up to @xmath73 at the time of the formation of the solar system and up to @xmath74 at the present epoch .",
    "the obstacle to obtaining large d - depletion is that it is generally necessary to assume much larger star formation efficiencies in the halo than in the disk , coupled with short timescales for the formation of both components .",
    "it is apparent from the figures that only the sequential models , such as i , m and q , are capable of sufficient ( or even excessive ) d - destruction .",
    "this is because the second infall episode , which gives rise to the disk in the two - infall models , replenishes the ism with large amounts of deuterium , thus compensating for most of its previous consumption .",
    "the sequential models fail , however , in comparison with the other observational constraints .",
    "in particular , their predicted g - dwarf metallicity distributions , shown in figure  [ cf5 ] , are dramatically different from those observed .",
    "the reason is that in these models infall occurs only during halo and disk formation and the very short timescales for these phases permit only very little gas accretion .",
    "consequently , the rapid consumption of the available  nearly pristine ",
    "gas yields high numbers of metal - poor stars .",
    "hence , these models lead to a predicted metallicity distribution which is shifted towards low metallicities compared to what is observed .    from our extensive study of all these models",
    "it is clear that those which destroy large amounts of deuterium do not fit the other constraints , whereas those which are in good agreement with the variety of observational data have much less deuterium consumption ( depletion by factors smaller than 23 ) .",
    "basically , the relatively high gas content and low metallicity of the local ism is incompatible with efficient cycling of the gas through stars . in contrast , scully et al .",
    "( 1997 ) claim their model ii does fit the observational constraints while destroying deuterium by an order of magnitude .",
    "however , for the following reason their model ii can not be describing the chemical evolution of the solar vicinity of the galaxy .",
    "scully et al .",
    "( 1997 ) fix the overall normalization of their sfr by requiring that model ii reproduce the observed present , local gas fraction .",
    "they do not normalize their sfr to the present , local sfr . as a result",
    ", they failed to notice that the predicted present sfr for model ii is an order of magnitude smaller than that observed locally ( tinsley 1980 , timmes et al .",
    "if the model ii sfr were renormalized to bring it into agreement with the observed local value , several observational obstacles would be encountered .",
    "an increased sfr leads to more rapid production of the heavy elements , along with even more deuterium destruction . to compensate for the former , perhaps the outflow rate",
    "could be increased as well . but this will result in a much smaller present gas fraction , no longer consistent with the data .",
    "furthermore , since the model ii initial sfr is nearly 200 times higher than that at present , if the present sfr were normalized to that observed locally , the initial sfr would have been far too large to be consistent with the observed luminosity distribution of galaxies ( pozzetti , bruzual & zamorani 1996 ; i.e. , young galaxies would be too bright ) and also inconsistent with the observed age - metallicity relation ( twarog 1980 , scalo 1986 , prantzos 1998 ) . to test these expectations",
    "we have constructed models r , s , t , and u ( see table 1 ) using the imf of scully et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and employing a sfr and a variety of winds analogous to those in their model ii . in all of these cases",
    "we confirm that the metallicity is too high ( reaching the solar value at @xmath75 gyr ) and the present gas fraction too small for consistency with the observational data .",
    "observations in the local ism and in the solar system provide valuable lower bounds to the primordial abundance of deuterium . if these data are to be utilized to predict , or bound from above , the primordial abundance it is necessary to calculate , or bound , the destruction of deuterium in the galaxy during its evolution .",
    "although most models of chemical evolution suggest only modest destruction ( e.g. , audouze & tinsley 1974 ; steigman & tosi 1992 , 1995 ; edmunds 1994 ; galli et al .",
    "1995 ; palla , galli & silk 1995 ; pilyugin & edmunds 1996 ; prantzos 1996 ) , it is claimed that models may be designed to destroy a significant fraction of primordial deuterium ( e.g. , vangioni - flam & audouze 1988 ; vangioni - flam , olive & prantzos 1994 ; scully & olive 1995 ; vangioni - flam & cass ' e 1995 ; scully et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 ) . to address this impasse",
    "we have first pursued an approach which is nearly independent of any chemical evolution models , relying only on the simple fact that to destroy deuterium gas must be cycled through stars and stars produce heavy elements .",
    "we have found that destruction of d by more than a factor of five seems unlikely ( see the upper panel of figure 1 ) .",
    "however , we have noted that since elements such as oxygen are synthesized in massive stars while the bulk of the gas is cycled through lower mass stars , this constraint on d - destruction may be circumvented if the debris of the massive stars is removed from the disk of the galaxy permanently ( see the lower panel of figure 1 ) .",
    "alternatively , although a radically different early imf might permit significant d - destruction while avoiding overproduction of the heavy elements , there is no evidence for any variations in the imf ( wyse 1997 ) .",
    "furthermore , such a radically different imf would inevitably alter the abundance ratios of elements produced in different stellar sites ( e.g. , oxygen / iron , nitrogen / iron , etc . ) .",
    "recently chiappini et al .",
    "( 1997b ) studied the effects of a variable imf and concluded that although the imf may be a function of time , such a time - variation must be small during the disk lifetime if the available observational constraints in the solar vicinity are to be satisfied .",
    "we have also considered the effect of infall of partially processed material in which some fraction of the primordial deuterium has been destroyed . even in these models",
    "d - destruction is limited to a factor of @xmath76 when the sun formed and @xmath77 at present .    to explore the observational constraints on d - destruction",
    "further we have attempted to couple the evolution of the halo with that of the disk while allowing for high initial sfr and outflow ( winds ) along with infall . although the two - infall models appear consistent with the heavy element data , they permit only modest destruction : less than a factor of @xmath73 when the sun formed and @xmath74 at present .",
    "in contrast , the sequential halo / disk models allow almost any d - destruction factor , but none of the models we explored are consistent with the bulk of the observational data .",
    "although there are no  theorems \" forbidding large d - destruction , it is quite difficult to break the connection between large gas fraction , low metallicity and modest d - destruction .",
    "star formation , infall and outflow are linked inextricably in the ecology and evolution of the galaxy .",
    "rapid star formation is required if a large fraction of the initial deuterium ( @xmath78 90% ) is to be destroyed .",
    "but , rapid star formation results in rapid production of the heavy elements and in a rapidly decreasing gas fraction .",
    "infall of primordial or nearly unprocessed gas may ameliorate the effect of a high sfr by diluting the metallicity and replenishing the gas trapped in long - lived stars and stellar remnants .",
    "however , the deuterium in the infalling gas drives the interstellar abundance back towards the higher primordial value resulting in less net d destruction .",
    "outflow of processed material may help keep the metallicity low , but when coupled with a large sfr , will result in a small gas fraction at present . for these reasons it is difficult to design chemical evolution models which destroy deuterium efficiently while maintaining consistency with the other observational data .",
    "in all the models that we and others have explored which are consistent with the observational data , the d - destruction at present is limited to a factor of 3 or less .",
    "if we adopt this as an upper bound , then we may bound from above the primordial abundance of deuterium : @xmath79 . adopting the linsky et al .",
    "( 1993 ) value for ( d / h)@xmath80 and assuming for the hydrogen mass fraction at present @xmath81 and primordially @xmath82 , we derive a @xmath83 upper bound of : ( d / h)@xmath84 .",
    "clearly , this inferred upper bound to primordial deuterium is in conflict with the high d / h values claimed for some qso absorbers ( carswell et al .",
    "1994 ; songaila et al . 1994 ; rugers & hogan 1996 ) but is entirely consistent with the low values derived by tytler et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and by burles & tytler ( 1996 ) . for standard",
    "bbn this upper bound to primordial d / h corresponds to a lower bound to the universal ratio of nucleons - to - photons @xmath85 or , in terms of the baryon density parameter ( @xmath86 ) and the hubble parameter ( h@xmath87 ) : @xmath88 .",
    "such a lower bound to @xmath89 , in the context of standard bbn , leads to a predicted lower bound on the primordial mass fraction of helium-4 ( y@xmath90 ) which is in modest disagreement with that inferred from observations of low - metallicity extragalactic regions ( olive & steigman 1995 ; olive , skillman & steigman 1997 ) unless systematic errors are responsible for the low value of y@xmath91 derived from the data .",
    "this latter possibility receives support from the new data of thuan & izotov ( 1998 ) who derive y@xmath92 .",
    "primordial deuterium is an invaluable baryometer . until the observational situation of nearly primordial gas in qso absorbers is resolved by more data , local ism and/or solar system data in concert with estimates or bounds to galactic d - destruction",
