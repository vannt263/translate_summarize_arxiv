    "as superfluidity and superconductivity , the integer quantum hall effect is a spectacular manifestation of the quantum nature at a macroscopic scale .",
    "interestingly , these three phenomena share the same property of disappearance of the dissipation at low temperatures . in the two - dimensional electron gases in the regime of the quantum hall effect ,",
    "the vanishing of the longitudinal magnetoresistance @xmath2 for a range in magnetic fields , is accompanied by another remarkable feature which is the formation of plateaus of the hall conductance @xmath3 with a robust quantization @xcite in integral multiples of @xmath4 .",
    "there is now a consensus @xcite that the existence of @xmath3 plateaus is intimately connected with the localization mechanism which causes the vanishing of dissipation . in a phenomenological picture the localized states that do not contribute to the longitudinal transport play the role of a reservoir for electrons which allows the chemical potential to sit between landau levels @xmath5 ( here @xmath6 is the cyclotron pulsation ) . on the other hand ,",
    "delocalized states are supposed to exist only within small energy bands centered around the energies @xmath7 .",
    "as long as the chemical potential lies within the region of localized states , the hall conductance @xmath3 is expected to remain constant and is related to the number of filled bands of delocalized states below the chemical potential .",
    "the observation of wide plateaus implies consequently a large density for the localized states with a much more significant spread in energy than for the density of delocalized states .",
    "the density of states with a mobility gap is therefore the essential condition for the quantum hall effect .",
    "@xcite    many different theoretical approaches @xcite have been proposed to explain the quantum hall effect , which can be divided in several classes .",
    "the most fruitful treatments , such as laughlin s gauge argument , @xcite and the edge state picture , @xcite provide an explanation for the quantization of the hall conductance , but rely on the assumption that there exist localized states in the bulk .",
    "direct diagrammatic calculations have been developed as well .",
    "models with point - like impurities are technically manageable , @xcite but require the artificial pinning of the chemical potential within gaps in the density of states to account for the existence of quantized hall plateaus .",
    "further developments to include finite - range disorder within the green functions diagrammatics were pursued , but appear more complicated , since it is needed to incorporate more and more diagrams with increasing strength of the magnetic field .",
    "@xcite    it is worth mentioning that the standard procedure @xcite that consists in averaging over impurity positions is in fact questionable in high magnetic fields .",
    "indeed , it is normally justified by the physical assumption of randomness after successive collision events .",
    "however , instead of the chaotic random walk , the electronic motion is relatively regular for high magnetic fields and smooth disorder potential . at the classical level",
    ", this leads to the breakdown of the drude - lorentz formula .",
    "@xcite quantum mechanically , this idea has led to the most simple and illuminating approach to explain the existence of hall plateaus , the guiding - center picture , @xcite which is a high - field approximation . within this `` semi - classical '' description ,",
    "the quantized cyclotron motion energy becomes a constant of motion when the disorder potential is smooth and varies less than the landau levels separation ( in order to have negligible landau levels mixing ) .",
    "the reason for this is an ineffective energy exchange between the two degrees of freedom , the fast cyclotron motion , and the slow guiding center motion .",
    "without such an exchange , the strong field localization is then associated with the drift motion of the guiding center of the cyclotron orbit along contours of constant disorder potential .",
    "the delocalization of electronic states is then due to the percolation of equipotential lines , that occurs at a single critical energy .",
    "the localization is thus determined in terms of the topology of the equipotential lines , and the resulting spectral properties vindicate the mobility gap argument for the appearance of the quantum hall effect in high fields .",
    "the computation of quantum transport beyond the @xmath8 limit has however not been achieved in a systematic way .",
    "@xcite because the matrix elements of the current density relate adjacent landau levels , the mixing of landau levels ( which is absent at infinite magnetic field ) needs thus to be taken into account in a rigorous way . in this paper",
    ", we reformulate the high field expansion in the framework of real - time green functions using a particular set of vortex eigenstates . the framework developed in our paper , although formally equivalent to the guiding center approach , allows a straightforward and systematic calculation of quantum transport at finite magnetic fields @xmath0 ( i.e. beyond the semi - classical limit @xmath9 ) , and leads to a transparent derivation of both the dissipationless longitudinal conductance and the quantized hall resistance .",
    "we also show starting from our bulk calculation that the conductance can be expressed in terms of edge contributions , thus providing a connection between the high - field approaches and the edge state picture .",
    "this result is found up to the third order in processes mixing the landau - levels , and may be a general result valid at all orders as long as the gradient expansion theory is applicable .",
    "we interpret this as a fundamental manifestation of the robustness of the electronic vortex states , which gives rise to strong localization properties at large but finite magnetic fields and in long - range disorder .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we consider the simple problem of a single charged particle in a magnetic field .",
    "we first analyze within a gauge - independent framework the origin of the landau levels energy quantization in terms of the wave - particle duality .",
    "such a preliminary discussion is needed because this origin is usually obscured by the choice of a gauge and the high degeneracy of the energy levels .",
    "we derive a basis of eigenstates in a way which shows that the energy quantization follows _ only _ from the single - valuedness of the wavefunction , i.e. from a topological condition . in sec .",
    "iii , by using this basis of vortex states , we introduce within the framework of the real - time green functions the high - field expansion that allows to treat a smooth disorder . in sec .",
    "iv we study thermodynamic properties , and especially compute the dependence of the chemical potential on the magnetic field , that is important to determine the width of the hall plateaus for different temperatures and disorder broadenings .",
    "quantum transport properties in high magnetic fields are investigated in sec .",
    "v. we discuss and summarize our work in section vi .",
    "some of the technical details such as the derivation and the resolution of the kinetic equation have been collected in the appendices .",
    "in this section , we consider a single electron of effective mass @xmath10 and of charge @xmath11 confined in a @xmath12 two - dimensional plane under a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath13 ( pointing in the @xmath14 direction ) .",
    "the influence of an impurity potential is postponed to section iii .",

    "for simplicity , we do not consider the spin degree of freedom and disregard therefore the zeeman splitting term .",
    "the wave functions @xmath19 and the energy eigenvalues @xmath20 are derived from the stationary schrdinger s equation    @xmath21    because it is the vector potential @xmath16 rather than the magnetic field @xmath13 which appears in @xmath22 , there is some freedom in solving eq .",
    "( @xmath23 ) . in the next two subsections",
    "we introduce the two most known ways presented in textbooks to solve it , before analyzing the question of the origin of the quantization of the energy spectrum .",
    "the traditional way @xcite to solve the eigen - problem ( [ vp ] ) is to introduce the landau gauge , for which the vector potential has the form @xmath24 .",
    "the hamiltonian is then also obviously invariant by translation in the @xmath25 direction so that the wave function is sought under the form @xmath26 with @xmath27 real .",
    "the function @xmath28 obeys the differential equation    @xmath29    typical of an harmonic oscillator .",
    "here we have introduced the magnetic length @xmath30 which is related to the quantum of magnetic flux @xmath31 as follows @xmath32    introducing the new coordinate @xmath33 with @xmath34 , a solution of ( [ eq1 ] ) is sought under the form @xmath35 h(x')\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is expanded in power series .",
    "the condition that @xmath37 for @xmath38 imposes that the function @xmath39 is a polynomial of order @xmath40 and leads to the well - known result of the quantization of the energy spectrum @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the cyclotron pulsation . here",
    "the energy @xmath20 is independent of the quantum number @xmath27 .",
    "this expresses an important degeneracy of the energy levels . finally , the wave functions are thus labeled by the quantum numbers @xmath40 and @xmath27 and are written as @xmath43 h_{n}\\left(\\frac{x - x_{0}}{l_{b}}\\right ) \\label{trans}\\ ] ] with @xmath44 the hermite polynomial of degree @xmath40 . within this basis ,",

    ", one can use the symmetrical gauge for which the vector potential is @xmath47 .",
    "introducing the polar coordinates @xmath48 , one can straightforwardly see that the hamiltonian @xmath22 is invariant by any rotation around the origin .",

    "the solutions ( [ rot ] ) describe states for which there is an equally probable distribution of orbits whose centers lie on a circle @xcite .      at this stage ,",
    "let us compare the origin of the energy quantization in the two different derivations .",
    "in the first case , the quantization originates from the vanishing of the wave function far from the origin in the @xmath76 direction .",
    "according to the second derivation , two integral numbers contribute to the energy quantization : the first integer ( @xmath50 ) results from the condition of single - valuedness of the wave function , while the second integer ( @xmath69 ) stems from the condition of square - integrability .    from this comparison ,",
    "the existence of a physical interpretation for the energy quantization is not clear .",
    "however , a clue for an unambiguous origin of this quantization seems to be provided by semi - classical arguments . according to the classical equations of motion , a single electron confined to a plane and in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field follows a circular orbit of radius @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a constant velocity .",
    "the classical kinetic energy can thus be written as @xmath79 with @xmath80 the magnetic flux enclosed by the trajectory . making the correspondence between this classical expression and the quantum expression [ eq .",
    "( [ qu1 ] ) or ( [ qu2 ] ) ] of the kinetic energy , we get in the semi - classical limit @xmath81 @xmath82 in this limit , the energy quantization can thus be interpreted as a consequence of the quantization of the flux enclosed by the cyclotron trajectory .",
    "furthermore , the flux enclosed by the trajectory can be seen in semi - classical terms as the phase accumulated during a cycle .",
    "we thus may wonder how the energy quantization is related to the phase of the wavefunction in fully quantum - mechanical terms . in subsection [ wave ] , we shall present a third derivation , which has the advantage to show explicitly how the energy quantization arises _ only _ from a topological condition in the point of view of the electron s wave - particle duality .      in order to understand the difference between the two bases derived previously and the role of the gauge , it is useful to work in a gauge - invariant formalism .",
    "an important consequence of the presence of a magnetic field is that the hamiltonian @xmath22 is always complex whatever the gauge chosen for the vector potential .",
    "this implies the existence of a non - trivial phase for the wave function .",
    "let us thus seek @xmath19 in the form    @xmath83 with @xmath84 and @xmath85 two real functions . substituting this form in the equation ( [ vp ] )",

    "note that in a hydrodynamical picture @xcite of quantum mechanics ( see also e.g. ref . )",
    ", @xmath87 plays the role of the density of a fictuous fluid and eq .",
    "( [ system1a ] ) is nothing else than the equation of continuity for the current probability in the stationary case .",
    "the explicit expression of the phase @xmath85 of the wave function depends on the choice of a gauge .",
    "note that however the system ( [ system1a])-([system1b ] ) is written in a gauge - invariant form .",
    "indeed , if we consider the gauge transformation @xmath88 , the phase transforms as @xmath89 the gauge is thus reabsorbed additively in the expression ( [ ph ] ) of the phase factor .",
    "accordingly , the phase factor can be typically divided into two parts @xmath90 a part @xmath91 which is gauge dependent , and a part @xmath92 which is gauge independent .",
    "let us denote the combination of the phase gradient and the quantity @xmath93 by the gauge - invariant wavevector @xmath94 , i.e. @xmath95 eqs .",
    "( [ system1a])-([system1b ] ) are then rewritten as @xmath96 the coupling of the continuity equation ( [ cont ] ) with the eq .",
    "( [ eig ] ) was bypassed in the former derivations of the energy eigenvalues by invoking the choice of a gauge and symmetry considerations .",
    "however , it is clear here that it is possible to get the energy quantization without specifying a gauge but rather by choosing the vectors @xmath94 .    indeed , for the translation - invariant states",
    ", we impose that the function @xmath84 depends only on the variable @xmath76 .",
    "if we impose in addition @xmath97 , we obtain from eq .",
    "( [ cont ] ) that @xmath98 .",
    "then , the vectors @xmath94 are fully determined from eq .",
    "( [ def ] ) which yields @xmath99 in the absence of phase singularities . after integration",
    ", we obtain that @xmath100 where @xmath27 is a constant of integration which is obviously gauge - independent . substituting this flow for @xmath94 in eq .",
    "( [ eig ] ) , we get the gauge - independent eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) yielding the energy spectrum .    for the rotation - invariant states",
    ", we impose that @xmath84 depends only on @xmath101 and @xmath97 .",
    "( [ cont ] ) yields straightforwardly that @xmath102 in the presence of a phase singularity at the origin , we have @xmath103 with @xmath50 a positive or negative integer ensuring the single - valuedness of the wave function @xmath19 .",
    "the form ( [ form ] ) together with the condition ( [ cond ] ) determines also an admissible flow of @xmath94 given by @xmath104 in the symmetrical gauge , the phase associated with this flow is given by @xmath105 , the gauge - dependent part @xmath91 being simply a constant .",
    "therefore , contrary to what could be inferred from the derivations [ sec_trans ] and [ sec_rot ] , it is not necessary to choose a gauge to write down the schrdinger s equation explicitly .",
    "furthermore , the real difference between the translation - invariant states and the rotation - invariant states is not the gauge because both kind of states can be obtained in any gauge .",
    "the real difference is in the choice of the flow of @xmath94 , which is intimately related to the symmetry of the probability density @xmath87 .",
    "the set of quantum numbers labelling the eigenstates arises directly from this choice .",
    "for instance , the vector @xmath94 can be either translation invariant or rotation invariant . as a result , there are many possibilities to choose other flows of @xmath94 satisfying the system of equations ( [ cont])-([eig ] ) .",
    "it is somehow remarkable that whatever this choice , the energy remains quantized as @xmath106 .      in absence of any potential ,",
    "the electron follows classically a periodic cyclotron motion around an arbitrary center @xmath107 . at the quantum level ,",
    "the translation invariance of the hamiltonian @xmath22 reflects precisely the degeneracy of the kinetic energy with respect to the position of the center , while its rotation invariance corresponds to the cyclotron motion .",
    "apparently , the former eigenstates ( [ trans ] ) or ( [ rot ] ) do not reflect the symmetry of the cyclotron motion around an arbitrary point @xmath107 so that the consideration of the classical limit is rather tricky . since they do not correspond to the classical picture of the motion , it is difficult to appreciate the wave - particle duality .",
    "let us thus try to construct a basis of eigenstates which has the right properties .",
    "for this purpose , we impose that the probability density @xmath87 has the same symmetry as the cyclotron motion , i.e. is a function of @xmath108 only .",
    "as previously , we take the freedom of having @xmath97 .",
    "then , we get from eq .",
    "( [ cont ] ) that @xmath109 it is straightforward to see that the flow @xmath110 is admissible from the point of view of the coupling of eqs .",
    "( [ cont])-([eig ] ) . here",
    ", we have deliberately located the phase singularity at the arbitrary position @xmath107 ( rather than at the origin as in [ sec_rot ] ) .    substituting the form ( [ flow ] ) in the eq .",
    "( [ eig ] ) we obtain a differential equation for @xmath84 which is similar to eq .",
    "( [ sim ] ) after introducing the new cylindrical coordinates defined by @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "the function @xmath113 with @xmath114 is a simple solution of this differential equation yielding the energy quantization @xmath115 at this stage , it is not needed to entirely solve the differential equation ( [ sim ] ) as done in [ sec_rot ] because we have already determined by this way enough states .",
    "for the same reason , we have restricted ourself to positive values of the integer @xmath50 .",
    "then , considering eq .",
    "( [ flow ] ) and taking the symmetrical gauge @xmath116 , we deduce that the phase - gradient takes the form @xmath117 we obtain that the normalized wave functions labelled by @xmath50 and @xmath118 are fully expressed in the symmetrical gauge as @xmath119 with @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 . for practical convenience ,",
    "we use henceforth the dirac notation @xmath123    we now argue that the set of eigenstates @xmath124 with @xmath50 restricted to positive values only ( @xmath114 ) forms a semi - orthogonal basis .",
    "the overlap between two states is calculated in appendix a , with the result : @xmath125 according to ( [ overlap ] ) , the states @xmath124 are orthogonal with respect to the quantum number @xmath50 , but not with respect to the vortex positions @xmath107 . however , the overlap is almost zero when the distance between two vortex positions exceeds a few magnetic lengths .",
    "let us prove that the set of vortex states ( [ vortex ] ) is complete .",
    "we have    @xmath126    recognizing the development into series of the exponential function , we perform first the sum over @xmath50 to get @xmath127    the remaining integrations over the vortex coordinates @xmath107 yield straightforwardly @xmath128 using that @xmath129 , inserting from the left @xmath130 and from the right @xmath131 , integrating over @xmath132 and @xmath133 , and using the completeness relation for the states @xmath130 , we get from this expression ( [ clo1 ] ) the completeness relation @xmath134 we see that the set of states is complete if we associate the area @xmath135 with the vortex coordinates @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "we deduce that the degeneracy of the energy levels is equal to @xmath138 per unit area ( i.e. for a finite system it corresponds to @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the total magnetic flux in the system ) , in agreement with the standard derivations making use of orthogonal sets of eigenstates .",
    "we have therefore presented a third way of derivation of the eigenvalues and eigenstates for the problem of a charged particle in an uniform magnetic field .",
    "we find that the energy eigenvalues ( [ eigenv ] ) are degenerate with respect to a continuous quantum number , namely the positions @xmath141 , which here correspond to the locations of a phase singularity . in the limit of infinite magnetic field",
    "only , the vortex location @xmath107 corresponds to the classical guiding center coordinates .",
    "it is worth noting that , contrary to previous standard derivations , we did not resort to any condition of square - integrability to obtain the quantization of the energy levels . here",
    ", the quantization of the kinetic energy stems _ only _ from the quantization of the angular momentum ( defined with respect to the position @xmath107 ) . in terms of the wave - particle duality ,",
    "the mechanism at hand is clearly the interference of the electronic wavefunction with itself due to the completion of a circular orbit .",
    "the eigenstates correspond to vortices located at the positions @xmath107 .",
    "their non - orthogonality with respect to @xmath107 reflects the quantum indeterminacy ( @xmath135 according to the completeness relation ) in the positions of the vortices .",
    "( [ closure ] ) constitutes an essential relation that allows to expand any wave function into a superposition of the vortex states @xmath142 .",
    "because one of the quantum numbers ( @xmath50 ) results only from the single - valuedness of the wave function , i.e. stems from a topological constraint , it is sensitive to local perturbations only on the scale of the magnetic length around the vortex positions @xmath107 .",
    "this property helps for example to capture the interplay of a confining potential and the landau levels in a straightforward manner . within the vortex states basis , it is clear that only the states whose vortex positions lie near the edges will be affected by the confinement . as a consequence , a deviation of the spectrum from the landau levels may be only significant near the edges .",
    "similar conclusions concerning the spectrum of finite systems can be reached after thorough calculations for particular models as the teller model ( confinement by hard walls ) or the model of elastic confinement ( for a discussion , see e.g. ref . ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the bulk states are not affected by the confining potential , which justifies the common disregard of the influence of edges when computing thermodynamical quantities of macroscopic systems",
    ". one important advantage of the present basis is therefore to allow a separate quantum treatment of the edges and of the bulk . despite the lack of orthogonality",
    ", we shall show in the next section that the basis of vortex states is also very convenient for the treatment of any random potential that varies smoothly on the scale of the magnetic length in high magnetic fields .",
    "finally , we note that the set of states ( [ vortex ] ) has been derived previously @xcite in the literature within different approaches and contexts , namely the coherent states formalism developed by glauber @xcite ( for a review on the theory of coherent states see e.g. ref . ) . indeed , the states ( [ vortex ] ) can be identified as coherent states of a charged particle in a magnetic field and they naturally obey the algebra @xcite expected for these states ( the algebra is characterized by the identities ( [ overlap ] ) and ( [ clo1 ] ) ) .",
    "a peculiarity here is that the vortex states ( [ vortex ] ) are both coherent states ( this property comes out through the degeneracy quantum number @xmath107 - the vortex location ) and eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( the eigenvalues are associated with the quantum number @xmath50 ) .",
    "@xcite the topological nature of the energy quantum number @xmath50 , that is fundamental to capture the quantum transport properties in finite magnetic fields as will be developed in the present paper , has seemingly not been recognized in these approaches .",
    "@xcite the set of states ( [ vortex ] ) has already been used for the calculation of the partition function @xcite and the wigner function .",
    "@xcite we shall present a systematic expansion using this set in the framework of the real - time green functions to study _ both _ thermodynamic and quantum transport properties in high magnetic fields .",
    "in this section , we consider that the electron feels , in addition to the perpendicular magnetic field , the presence of a potential @xmath143 .",

    "a detailed and quantitative study of this problem within our formalism is beyond the scope of the present paper and is therefore postponed for future work .",
    "the quantum hall effect is known @xcite to break down at low magnetic fields and for high current intensities .",
    "these limitations can be captured qualitatively within the condition of applicability of the high magnetic fields expansion theory . indeed , the quantum hall effect regime holds roughly as long as the potential @xmath145 ( which includes the electrostatic potential and the impurity potential ) is smooth at the scale of the magnetic length , i.e. @xmath329 where @xmath161 is the typical length scale for the potential .",
    "an increase of the current intensity induces unavoidably an increase of the net gradient of the electrostatic potential , and thus a reduction of the characteristic length scale @xmath161 of the potential variations .",
    "equivalently , the inequality @xmath329 breaks down in low magnetic fields since @xmath330 diverges when @xmath331 .",
    "the quantitative determination of the critical values of current and of magnetic field seems arduous since it supposes the accurate determination of the radius of convergence of the functional series ( [ ser ] ) and of the high - field expansion of the green functions .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the low magnetic field regime is usually characterized by another quantum effect , namely the shubnikov - de haas oscillations of the longitudinal resistance @xmath2 , while the high magnetic field regime corresponds to the quantum hall effect . in the shubnikov - de haas regime",
    ", @xmath2 presents minima between the landau levels that become deeper and deeper when increasing the strength of the magnetic field , whereas there is a preformation of rough steps in the @xmath326 features . in the quantum hall effect regime",
    ", @xmath2 drops to zero .",
    "the passage from the shubnikov - de haas regime to the quantum hall regime is relatively smooth .",
    "it suggests the existence of a physical relationship between these two quantum effects .",
    "the theory of the shubnikov - de haas effect for the two - dimensional electron gas in the presence of a disordered potential has been developed a long time ago within the green functions formalism and the standard impurity averaging procedure .",
    "@xcite the oscillations of @xmath2 are usually understood in terms of the oscillations of the density of states . within this picture ,",
    "the minima of @xmath2 are related to the minima of the density of states .",
    "theoretical derivations @xcite of these oscillations making use of semi - classical green functions provide a deeper interpretation concerning the physical origin of the shubnikov - de haas effect . within this semi - classical approach ,",
    "the oscillations of @xmath2 and of @xmath326 are interpreted as interference effects due to a fraction of electrons following classical periodic orbits , in close relation to the gutzwiller s trace formula @xcite for the density of states .",
    "@xcite this fraction @xmath332 ( where @xmath69 is the mean free path ) of electrons participating to magnetic quantum effects in low fields @xcite corresponds to the classical probability that the electron will complete a cyclotron orbit without having suffered a collision .",
    "@xcite note that the disorder tends to reduce this probability and thus destroys these magnetic interference effects .",
    "this is in complete contrast with the weak localization effects that are induced by the disorder and are suppressed by the application of a weak magnetic field ( see e.g. ref . ) .",
    "since the cyclotron radius diminishes with the magnetic field , the fraction of circling electrons increases and the minima of @xmath2 become more and more pronounced . in the limit of infinite magnetic field",
    ", we expect from the semi - classical picture that all the electrons participate to these magnetic interference effects .    in the present work ,",
    "we have shown that the quantization of the orbital degree of freedom confers a robustness on the periodic cyclotron motion , so that the electronic states have a probability higher than the classical one ( given above ) of returning to a same given position .",
    "the ineffective energy exchange between the orbital degree of freedom and the vortex degree of freedom occurs consequently in any local region of smooth potential in high but finite magnetic fields , i.e. not only in the semi - classical limit @xmath8 .",
    "this property resulting from the topological character of the circulation quantum number @xmath50 is illustrated by the possibility to define a vortex current density @xmath333 at any order of the high magnetic fields gradient expansion .",
    "the electronic system enters into the quantum hall regime when all the electronic vortex states contribute to the magnetic interference effects ( strong localization ) .",
    "accordingly , the shubnikov - de haas effect can effectively be seen as a precursor to the quantum hall effect .",
    "the insensitivity to the type of impurities and the reproductivity of the experimental results independently of the type of host material has suggested that the quantum hall effect is due to a fundamental principle . in the first half of the paper",
    ", we have shown that the quantization of the energy spectrum into landau levels is associated with the topological condition of the single - valuedness of the single - particle wavefunction .",
    "electronic states can thus be characterized by vortex states whose nature comes out in the presence of a perturbation ( for instance a disordered potential ) .",
    "as developed in the second half of the paper , the robustness of the vortex states is responsible for the remarkable quantum transport properties of a two - dimensional electron gas in high _ finite _ magnetic fields , namely the vanishing of the longitudinal conductance and the quantization of the hall conductance .    by reformulating the high - field expansion theory using a vortex states representation , we have rigourously derived within the formalism of real - time green functions a quantum mechanical expression for the current . within our vortex representation ,",
    "a current is obviously associated with a ( hydrodynamic ) vortex flow .",
    "we have shown that this quantum mechanical property is an exact result that holds as long as the high - field expansion is applicable .",
    "we have demonstrated explicitly from a bulk derivation up to third order processes in landau - levels mixing that the total current can be expressed entirely in terms of edge contributions .",
    "this remarkable property together with boundary requirements leads directly to the absence of dissipation and to the quantization of the hall conductance .",
    "we have emphasized that the density of states is not necessarily small between the landau levels in the vortex regime . by computing the oscillations of the chemical potential with the magnetic field ,",
    "we have pointed out that at any finite temperature the widest widths for the hall plateaus are precisely obtained in the case of the broadest landau levels , in agreement with experimental observations .    the quantum mechanical picture and the formalism developed in the paper are appealing to explain several issues concerning the quantum hall effect .",
    "we have already pointed out qualitatively the relationship between the shubnikov - de haas regime in low magnetic fields and the quantum hall regime in higher magnetic fields . moreover , as also underlined , our formalism allows a systematic calculation of higher order contributions to the current .",
    "finally , we hope that it will be possible to generalize the presented approach of the quantum transport to incorporate the interaction effects between the electrons that appear to be crucial to capture the dissipative longitudinal transport .",
