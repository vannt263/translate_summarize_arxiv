    "recently there has been a lot of phenomenological interest in external particles interacting inside a heat - bath .",

    "however , such processes are often infra - red sensitive .",
    "phenomenological studies have used arbitrary infra - red cutoffs to obtain finite results .",
    "it is legitimate to ask whether one can remove this arbitrariness and obtain stable finite results for such infra - red sensitive processes .    in this paper",
    "we consider the simpler , but related , problem of hard scatterings of some external particles introduced within a heat - bath at a temperature @xmath1 .",
    "we choose two of the simplest processes in qed the scattering of an electron with an off - shell photon and the annihilation of an electron - positron pair into an off - shell photon .",
    "due to quantum and thermal fluctuations , extra soft particles can also be involved in each of these scatterings .",
    "if @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the summed momenta of all the hard initial and final state particles respectively , then one can construct the difference @xmath8 we study the distribution of @xmath9 through the measurement of a suitable semi - inclusive cross section .",
    "it is non - trivial because of the extra soft particles .",
    "when @xmath10 ( @xmath11 is the scale of the hard process ) , the lorentz - invariant cross section factorises as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the inclusive cross section for the process . throughout this paper",
    "we assume such a factorisation , and study the distribution of @xmath14 ( the second factor on the right hand side ) through its cumulants , _",
    "i.e. _ , the connected parts of the moments .",
    "naively , it might seem that the heat - bath spoils the lorentz invariance of various cross sections .",
    "this is incorrect .",
    "the bath only selects a frame ; lorentz invariance can not be lost due to the existence of a special frame .",
    "cross sections which are lorentz invariant at @xmath3 remain so for @xmath2 .",
    "we carry out a fully covariant treatment of the resummation and show that the difference between @xmath3 and @xmath2 physics lies in some new asymmetries and angular correlations .",
    "these are proportional to powers of the temperature . as a result",

    "they computed one such cross section and showed that it is indeed non - singular . in the limit where the detector becomes ideal , _ i.e. _",
    ", the resolution becomes infinitely sharp , this cross section remains non - singular .",

    "the infra - red singularities could be stronger , since every squared matrix element comes with a thermal distribution function attached to each external leg .",

    "then we extract the cumulants of this distribution and find terms of the form @xmath4 .",
    "these large logarithms come from parts of phase space where the extra photons are nearly collinear with the fermion momenta , exactly as at @xmath3 .",
    "these large terms allow us to identify phenomenologically interesting results from such soft photon resummations at finite temperature .",
