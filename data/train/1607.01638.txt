    "our understanding of the hadron structure depends on what we know about the parton distribution functions and fragmentation functions .",
    "these functions appear in the decompositions of the parton correlation functions . in recent years",
    ", several kinds of experiments have been carried out , such as the semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) , and @xmath3 annihilation into hadrons , which provide us considerable information on a class of t - odd and chiral - odd fragmentation functions .",
    "a notable example is the collins function  @xcite @xmath4 that describes the fragmentation of a transversely polarized quark to an unpolarized hadron ( e.g. a pion ) and can be used to analyse the hadronic quark spin contribution .",
    "it has been widely recognized that the collins function plays an important role in the understanding of the transverse single spin asymmetries ( ssas ) .",
    "in addition , the @xmath5 annihilation data combined with the sidis data can be applied to extract  @xcite the collins function .    within the field",
    "theoretical framework of qcd , there are two approaches to interpret ssas in high energy processes : the transverse - momentum - dependent ( tmd ) approach  @xcite and the twist-3 collinear factorization in terms of multi - parton correlation  @xcite .",
    "recently , it was suggested  @xcite that the fragmentation contribution in the twist-3 collinear framework may be also important for the ssa in pp collision .",
    "later phenomenological analysis  @xcite showed that , besides the contribution of the twist-3 collinear distribution functions , twist-3 fragmentation functions are also necessary for describing the ssa data in both sidis and @xmath6 collision  @xcite in a consistent manner  @xcite .",
    "three chiral - odd fragmentation functions , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , participate in those processes .",
    "the first one corresponds to the first @xmath2-moment of the tmd collins function and has been applied to interpret the ssa in @xmath6 collisions in previous studies  @xcite .",
    "the second one appears in the subleading order of a @xmath10 expansion of the quark - quark correlator , while its tmd version @xmath11 is also a twist-3 function .",
    "the function @xmath9 is the imaginary part of @xmath12 , and is connected to another fragmentation function @xmath13(z ) through an integration over @xmath14  @xcite , with @xmath15 the collinear version of @xmath16 , which is encoded in the tmd quark - gluon - quark correlation function .",
    "it has been found that @xmath13 also plays an important role in the transverse ssa @xmath17 in sidis  @xcite .    at the twist-3 level ,",
    "apart from @xmath16 and @xmath11 , there are two other t - odd tmd fragmentation functions for a spin-0 hadron , denoted by @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "they appear in the decompositions of the quark - gluon - quark and quark - quark correlators , respectively . in the tmd framework",
    "@xcite , the fragmentation function @xmath20 may give rise to longitudinal beam ssa ( denoted by @xmath21 ) and target ssa ( denoted by @xmath22 , through the coupling with the unpolarized distribution function @xmath23 .",
    "sizable longitudinal ssas in sidis have already been measured by the hermes  @xcite , clas  @xcite and compass  @xcite collaborations .",
    "the ssas are phenomenologically interpreted by the twist-3 distribution functions  @xcite .",
    "however , quantitative effects of the twist-3 t - odd fragmentation on the longitudinal ssas have never been considered , because of the poor knowledge of @xmath20 .",
    "for this reason we will study the two twist-3 t - odd fragmentation functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 , using a spectator model , which assumes that the final hadron @xmath26 is produced through the process @xmath27 , with @xmath28 is the spectator quark .",
    "the spectator model has also been applied to calculate the collins functions of pion and kaon  @xcite , as well as the the twist-3 fragmentation functions @xmath16 and @xmath11 .",
    "for the tmd fragmentation functions , one can define the following quark - quark correlation function  @xcite : @xmath29 where the light - cone coordinates @xmath30 have been applied , @xmath31 and @xmath32 denote the momenta of the parent quark and produced hadron , respectively , and @xmath33 .",
    "the notation @xmath34 represents the wilson line ( gauge link ) running along the direction from @xmath35 to @xmath36 at the fixed position @xmath37 .",
    "the detailed discussion on the wilson line @xmath38 has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the rest of this paper",
    ", we will utilize the feynman gauge , in which the transverse gauge links @xmath39 and @xmath40 can be neglected  @xcite .    up to the twist-3 level",

    "one is @xmath42 , which has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite ( its collinear version @xmath8 has also been studied in ref .",
    "the other is the fragmentation function @xmath24 .",
    "similar to the t - odd distribution function @xmath43 , @xmath24 exists because of the direction of the wilson line . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : corr ] ) , @xmath44 can be projected from the following trace @xmath45\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : trace}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as is well known , the tree level calculation yields vanishing contributions to @xmath24 , since the t - odd fragmentation functions are contributed by the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude  @xcite .",
    "therefore one has to consider the diagrams at the loop level . in this paper",
    ", we will take into account the contribution of gluon rescattering at the one loop order , which is also essential to ensure the color gauge invariance of fragmentation functions .",
    "the calculation of the fragmentation function @xmath24 in the spectator model is analogous to the previous calculations of the collins function  @xcite and the twist-3 fragmentation function @xmath46  @xcite . in principle , there are four different diagrams ( and their hermitian conjugates ) may give rise to @xmath24 , as shown in fig .",

    "however , in our case we find that the contributions from the self - energy diagram ( fig .  [ deltadiag]a ) and the vertex diagram ( fig .  [ deltadiag]b ) vanish , while the last two diagrams , the photon - vertex ( fig .  [ deltadiag]c ) diagram and box diagram ( fig .",
    "[ deltadiag]d ) , generate nonzero contributions .        using the spectator model , for the case of quark fragmenting into a pseudoscalar meson , we can write the expressions of the correlator contributed by fig .

    "however , this will not affect the calculation of the fragmentation function @xmath24 , which is similar to the case of the collins function  @xcite and the twist-3 fragmentation function @xmath46 .    to obtain the imaginary part of the correlator",
    ", we utilize the cutkosky cut rule to put the gluon and quark lines on the mass shell .",
