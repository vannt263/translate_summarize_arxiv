    "the wave of neural models has eventually reached the field of statistical machine translation ( smt ) . after a period in which neural mt ( nmt ) was too computationally costly and resource demanding to compete with state - of - the - art phrase - based mt ( pbmt ) , the situation changed in 2015 . for the first time , in the latest edition of iwslt @xcite , the system described in @xcite overtook a variety of pbmt approaches with a large margin ( @xmath0 bleu points ) on a difficult language pair like english - german  anticipating what , most likely , will be the new nmt era .",
    "this impressive improvement follows the distance reduction previously observed in the wmt 2015 shared translation task @xcite .",
    "just few months earlier , the nmt systems described in @xcite ranked on par with the best phrase - based models on a couple of language pairs .",
    "such rapid progress stems from the improvement of the recurrent neural network encoder - decoder model , originally proposed in @xcite , with the use of the attention mechanism @xcite .",
    "this evolution has several implications .",
    "on one side , nmt represents a simplification with respect to previous paradigms . from a management point of view ,",
    "similar to pbmt , it allows for a more efficient use of human and data resources with respect to rule - based mt . from the architectural point of view , a large recurrent network trained for end - to - end translation is considerably simpler than traditional mt systems that integrate multiple components and processing steps . on the other side ,",
    "the nmt process is less transparent than previous paradigms .",
    "indeed , it represents a further step in the evolution from rule - based approaches that explicitly manipulate knowledge , to the statistical / data - driven framework , still comprehensible in its inner workings , to a sub - symbolic framework in which the translation process is totally opaque to the analysis .    what do we know about the strengths of nmt and the weaknesses of pbmt",
    "what are the linguistic phenomena that deep learning translation models can handle with such greater effectiveness ? to answer these questions and go beyond poorly informative bleu scores , we perform the very first comparative analysis of the two paradigms in order to shed light on the factors that differentiate them and determine their large quality differences .",
    "we build on evaluation data available for the iwslt 2015 mt english - german task , and compare the results of the first four top - ranked participants .",
    "we choose to focus on one language pair and one task because of the following advantages : _",
    "( i ) _ three state - of - the art pbmt systems compared against the nmt system on the same data and in the very same period ( that of the evaluation campaign ) ; _",
    "( ii ) _ a challenging language pair in terms of morphology and word order differences ; _ ( iii ) _ availability of mt outputs post - editing done by professional translators , which is very costly and thus rarely available . in general ,",
    "post - edits have the advantage of allowing for informative and detailed analyses since they directly point to translation errors . in this specific framework ,",
    "the high quality data created by professional translators guarantees reliable evaluations .",
    "for all these reasons we present our study as a solid contribution to the better understanding of this new paradigm shift in mt .    after reviewing previous work ( section [ previous ] ) ,",
    "we introduce the analyzed data and the systems that produced them ( section [ exp - setting ] ) .",
    "we then present three increasingly fine levels of mt quality analysis .",
    "we first investigate how mt systems quality varies with specific characteristics of the input , _",
    "i.e. _ sentence length and type of content of each talk ( section [ overall - quality ] ) .",
    "then , we focus on differences among mt systems with respect to morphology , lexical , and word order errors ( section [ errors ] ) . finally , based on the finding that word reordering is the strongest aspect of nmt compared to the other systems , we carry out a fine - grained analysis of word order errors ( section [ fine_reordering ] ) .",
    "to date , nmt systems have only been evaluated by bleu in single - reference setups @xcite .",
    "additionally , the montreal nmt system submitted to wmt 2015 @xcite was part of a manual evaluation experiment where a large number of non - professional annotators were asked to rank the outputs of multiple mt systems @xcite .",
    "results for the montreal system were very positive  ranked first in english - german , third in german - english , english - czech and czech - english  which confirmed and strengthened the bleu results published so far .",
    "unfortunately neither bleu nor manual ranking judgements tell us which translation aspects are better modeled by different mt frameworks . to this end , a detailed and systematic error analysis of nmt _ vs. _ pbmt output is required .",
    "translation error analysis , as a way to identify systems weaknesses and define priorities for their improvement , has received a fair amount of attention in the mt community . in this work",
    "we opt for the _ automatic _ detection and classification of translation errors based on _ manual _ post - edits of the mt output .",
    "we believe this choice provides an optimal trade - off between fully manual error analysis @xcite , which is very costly and complex , and fully automatic error analysis @xcite , which is noisy and biased towards one or few arbitrary reference translations .",
    "existing tools for translation error detection are either based on word error rate ( wer ) and position - independent word error rate ( per ) @xcite or on output - reference alignment @xcite .",
    "regarding error classification , hjerson @xcite detects five main types of word - level errors as defined in @xcite : morphological , reordering , missing words , extra words , and lexical choice errors .",
    "we follow a similar but simpler error classification ( morphological , lexical , and word order errors ) , but detect the errors differently using ter as this is the most natural choice in our evaluation framework based on post - edits ( see also section  [ methodology ] ) .",
    "propose another word - level error analysis technique specifically focused on lexical choice and aimed at understanding the effects of domain differences on mt .",
    "their error classification is strictly related to model coverage and insensitive to word order differences .",
    "the technique requires access to the system s phrase table and is thus not applicable to nmt , which does not rely on a fixed inventory of translation units extracted from the parallel data .",
    "previous error analyses based on manually post - edited translations were presented in @xcite .",
    "we are the first to conduct this kind of study on the output of a neural mt system .",
    "we perform a number of analyses on data and results of the iwslt 2015 mt _ en - de _ task , which consists in translating manual transcripts of english ted talks into german .",
    "evaluation data are publicly available through the wit@xmath1 repository @xcite .",
    "ted talks are a collection of rather short speeches ( max 18 minutes each , roughly equivalent to 2,500 words ) covering a wide variety of topics .",
    "all talks have captions , which are translated into many languages by volunteers worldwide . besides representing a popular benchmark for spoken language technology , ted talks embed interesting research challenges .",
    "translating ted talks implies dealing with spoken rather than written language , which is hence expected to be structurally less complex , formal and fluent @xcite .",
    "moreover , as human translations of the talks are required to follow the structure and rhythm of the english captions , a lower amount of rephrasing and reordering is expected than in the translation of written documents .",
    "as regards the english - german language pair , the two languages are interesting since , while belonging to the same language family , they have marked differences in levels of inflection , morphological variation , and word order , especially long - range reordering of verbs .",
    "five systems participated in the mt _ en - de _ task and were manually evaluated on a representative subset of the official 2015 test set . the human evaluation ( he ) set includes the first half of each of the 12 test talks , for a total of 600 sentences and around 10k words .",
    "five professional translators were asked to post - edit the mt output by applying the minimal edits required to transform it into a fluent sentence with the same meaning as the source sentence .",
    "data were prepared so that all translators equally post - edited the five mt outputs , _",
    "i.e. _ 120 sentences for each evaluated system",
    ".    the resulting evaluation data consist of five new reference translations for each of the sentences in the he set .",
    "each one of these references represents the _ targeted translation _ of the system output from which it was derived , but the other four _ additional translations _ can also be used to evaluate each mt system .",
    "we will see in the next sections how we exploited the available post - edits in the more suitable way depending on the kind of analysis carried out .      .mt",
    "systems overview .",
    "data column : size of parallel / monolingual training data for each system in terms of english and german tokens .",
    "[ cols=\"^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the upper part of table  [ tab : shiftclasses ] shows that verbs are by far the most often misplaced word category in all pbmt systems  an issue already known to affect standard phrase - based smt between german and english @xcite .",
    "reordering is particularly difficult when translating _ into _ german , since the position of verbs in this language varies according to the clause type ( _ e.g. _ main _ vs. _ subordinate ) .",
    "our results show that even syntax - informed pbmt does not solve this issue . using syntax at decoding time , as done by",
    "one of the systems combined within pbsy , appears to be a better strategy than using it for source pre - ordering , as done by the hpb  and spb  systems .",
    "however this only results in a moderate reduction of verb reordering errors ( -12% and _ vs. _ hpb  and spb  respectively ) . on the contrary ,",
    "nmt reduces verb order errors by an impressive -70% with respect to pbsy  ( -74% and _ vs. _ hpb  and spb  respectively ) despite being trained on raw parallel data without any syntactic annotation , nor explicit modeling of word reordering .",
    "this result shows that the recurrent neural language model at the core of the nmt architecture is very successful at generating well - formed sentences even in languages with less predictable word order , like german ( see examples in table  [ table : examples](a , b ) ) .",
    "nmt , though , gains notably less on nouns ( ) , which is the second most often misplaced word category in pbsy . more insight on this",
    "is provided by the lower part of the table , where reordering errors are divided by their dependency label as well as pos tag . here",
    "we see that order errors on nouns are notably reduced by nmt when they act as syntactic objects ( -65% obja : n ) but less when they act as preposition complements ( -36% pn : n ) or subjects ( -33% subj : n ) .",
    "the smallest nmt-_vs_-pbsy  gains are observed on prepositions ( prep ) , negation particles ( ptkneg ) and articles ( art ) .",
    "manual inspection of a data sample reveals that misplaced prepositions are often part of misplaced prepositional phrases acting , for instance , as temporal or instrumental adjuncts ( e.g. _ ` in my life ' _ , _ ` with this video ' _ ) . in these cases ,",
    "the original mt output is overall understandable and grammatical , but does not conform to the order of german semantic arguments that is consistently preferred by post - editors ( see example in table  [ table : examples](c ) ) .",
    "articles , due to their commonness , are often misaligned by hter and marked as _ shift _",
    "errors instead of being marked as two unrelated substitutions .",
    "finally , negation particles account for less than 1% of the target tokens but play a key role in determining the sentence meaning .",
    "looking closely at some error examples , we found that the correct placement of the german particle _ nicht _ was determined by the focus of negation in the source sentence , which is difficult to detect in english .",
    "for instance in table  [ table : examples](d ) two interpretations are possible ( _ ` that did not work ' _ or _ ` that worked , but not for systematic reasons ' _ ) , each resulting in a different , but equally grammatical , location of _ nicht_. in fact , negation - focus detection calls for a deep understanding of the sentence semantics , often requiring extra - sentential context @xcite .",
    "when faced with this kind of translation decisions , nmt performs as poorly as its competitors .    in summary",
    ", our fine - grained analysis confirms that nmt concentrates its word order improvements on important linguistic constituents and , specifically in english - german , is very close to solving the infamous problem of long - range verb reordering which so many pbmt approaches have only poorly managed to handle . on the other hand",
    ", nmt still struggles with more subtle translation decisions depending , for instance , on the semantic ordering of adjunct prepositional phrases or on the focus of negation .",
