    "single - pion production in nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath14 ) collisions may be separated into isoscalar and isovector production .",
    "excitation of the @xmath6 resonance and of higher - lying @xmath9 states in the course of the collision process can only happen in an isovector process .",
    "hence the isoscalar single - pion production is restricted to non - resonant as well as resonant isoscalar processes like the excitation of the roper resonance @xmath7 and higher - lying @xmath15 resonances  but also to the excitation and decay of the recently observed dibaryon state @xmath8 with @xmath16 @xcite    at incident energies below 1 gev single - pion production is strongly characterized by excitation and decay of the @xmath6 resonance .",
    "there have been several attempts in the past to extract the isoscalar production cross section , in order to reveal production processes other than the dominating @xmath9 process . since",
    "single - pion production in @xmath14 collisions is either purely isovector or isospin - mixed , the isoscalar cross section has to be obtained by combination of various cross section measurements . most often the relation @xcite :    @xmath17    is used . since here",
    "the difference of two usually big values enters , the experimental uncertainties appear generally quite large relative to the obtained absolute values .",
    "previous experimental studies from near threshold up to 1 gev incident energy give a large scatter of values with a tendency of being close to zero at low energies and increasing to values in the range of 1 - 2 mb @xcite towards 1 gev , in ref .",
    "@xcite even up to 4 mb .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the isoscalar cross sections have not been derived by use of eq .",
    "( 1 ) . instead of using total cross sections a partial - wave analysis was applied to ( unnormalized ) angular and invariant mass distributions .",
    "the isoscalar cross section was then extracted from the observed asymmetries in the pion angular distribution .    here",
    "we report on first measurements of the isoscalar cross section from @xmath3 = 0.95 gev up to 1.3 gev ( @xmath5 = 2.3 - 2.46 gev ) by use of eq .",
    "( 1 ) . aside from the @xmath6 and @xmath7 excitations",
    ", this energy range covers the region of the @xmath8 dibaryon resonance .",
    "whereas this resonance is considered to decay via an intermediate @xmath18 system in general @xcite , kukulin and platonova @xcite recently proposed an alternative scenario , where this resonance decays into the @xmath19 threshold state @xmath20 with @xmath21 by emission of a pion in relative @xmath22 wave .",
    "kinematically such a decay is hard to distinguish from that via an intermediate @xmath18 system .",
    "however , contrary to the latter the decay via @xmath20 causes a decay branch @xmath23 because of the decay @xmath24 . according to the said partial - wave analyses @xcite",
    "the latter decay branch is 16 - 18@xmath13 . using a total @xmath25 production cross section of about 1.7 mb extracted from the observed decays into @xmath14 and @xmath26 channels @xcite",
    ", we thus expect a peak cross section of about 340 @xmath12b for the route @xmath27 .    following a suggestion of bugg @xcite , @xmath8 could represent as well a @xmath28 system .",
    "such a scenario would cause , too , a decay of @xmath8 into the isoscalar @xmath29 system . since the roper resonance decays into the @xmath30 channel with a probability of 55  -  75@xmath13 @xcite",
    ", we expect in this case a cross section as large as 1.1 - 1.4  mb for the route @xmath31 .",
    "in order to utilize eq . ( 1 ) for the extraction of the isoscalar single - pion production we have measured both reactions @xmath32 and @xmath33 simultaneously by use of their quasifree processes in @xmath2 collisions . the experiment has been carried out at cosy ( forschungszentrum jlich ) at the wasa detector setup by using a proton beam with an energy of @xmath3  =  1.2  gev impinging on a deuterium pellet target @xcite . by exploiting the quasi - free scattering processes @xmath34 and @xmath35",
    ", we cover the energy region @xmath4 gev corresponding to @xmath5 = 2.30 - 2.44 gev .",
    "this includes the regions of @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 resonance excitations .",
    "the hardware trigger utilized in this analysis required at least one charged hit in the forward detector as well as two recorded clusters in the central detector .    the quasi - free reaction @xmath36 has been selected in the offline analysis by requiring one proton track in each of the forward and central detectors as well as two photon hits in the central detector , which can be traced back to the decay of a @xmath37 particle .",
    "the quasi - free reaction @xmath38 has been selected in the same way with the difference that now instead of two photon hits a @xmath39 track has been required in the central detector .    that way , the non - measured spectator four - momentum could be reconstructed by a kinematic fit with two and one over - constraints , respectively , which derive from the conditions for energy and momentum conservation and the @xmath37 mass .",
    "the achieved resolution in @xmath5 was about 20 mev .",
    "the charged particles registered in the segmented forward detector of wasa have been identified by use of the @xmath40 energy loss method . for its application in the data analysis ,",
    "all combinations of signals stemming from the five layers of the forward range hodoscope have been used .",
    "the charged particles in the central detector have been identified by their curved track in the magnetic field as well as by their energy loss in the surrounding plastic scintillator barrel and electromagnetic calorimeter .    in total a sample of about 924000 good @xmath41 and",
    "235000 good @xmath42 events has been selected .",
    "the requirement that the two protons have to be each in the angular range covered by the forward and central detector and that the @xmath39 and the gammas resulting from @xmath37 decay have to be in the angular range of the central detector reduces the overall acceptance to about 38@xmath13 and 41@xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the total reconstruction efficiency including all cuts and kinematical fitting has been 3.5@xmath13 and 1@xmath13 , respectively . efficiency and acceptance corrections of the data have been performed by mc simulations of reaction process and detector setup . for the mc simulations pure phase - space and model descriptions",
    "have been used , which will be discussed in the next chapter . since wasa",
    "does not cover the full reaction phase space , albeit a large fraction of it , these corrections are not fully model independent .",
    "the hatched grey histograms in figs .",
    "2 - 4 give an estimate for these systematic uncertainties . as a measure of these we have taken the difference between model corrected results and those obtained by assuming pure phase space for the acceptance corrections .",
    "though this very conservative estimate may considerably exaggerate the true systematic uncertainties , it demonstrates the stability of the corrections .",
    "compared to the uncertainties in these corrections , systematic errors associated with modeling the reconstruction of particles are negligible .",
    "the absolute normalization of the data has been obtained by comparison of the quasi - free single pion production process @xmath43 to previous bubble - chamber results for the @xmath44 reaction @xcite .",
    "that way , the uncertainty in the absolute normalization of our data is essentially that of the previous @xmath45 data , _",
    "i.e. _ in the order of 5 - 15@xmath13 . for the @xmath0 reaction the extrapolation to full phase space introduces some model dependence , which gives an uncertainty in the order of 5 @xmath13 in the absolute scale of this cross section relative to the one of the @xmath46 reaction .",
    "in order to determine the energy dependence of the total cross sections for the @xmath32 and @xmath0 reactions , we have divided our data sample into bins of 50 mev width in the incident energy @xmath3 .",
    "the resulting total cross sections for these channels as well as for the isoscalar channel determined by use of eq .",
    "( 1 ) are shown in fig .  1 together with results from earlier measurements @xcite . our data for the @xmath41 channel exhibit a flat energy dependence in good agreement with previous data .",
    "for the @xmath42 channel our data show a slope slightly declining with increasing energy  in fair agreement with previous results , which exhibit quite some scatter .    the isoscalar cross section as obtained by use of eq .",
    "( 1 ) is displayed at the bottom panel of fig .  1",
    ". our data exhibit cross sections in the range of 5 mb . in the overlap region with previous results , at incident energies around 1 gev , our data agree with those obtained by dakhno _",
    "@xcite , but are higher than the results of refs .",
    "the latter used cross sections for the @xmath32 reaction , which are higher by roughly 10@xmath13 than those used in ref .",
    "@xcite .    by use of eq .",
    "( 1 ) the 5 @xmath13 uncertainty in the absolute scale of our cross sections for the @xmath42 channel relative to those of the @xmath41 channel translates to an uncertainty of 30 @xmath13 , _ i.e. _ about 1 mb , in the absolute scale of the isoscalar cross section .",

    "we observe , however , no indication of a corresponding enhancement in the energy dependence of the cross section .",
    "we can therefore only give an upper limit based on the statistical uncertainty of the data points in the @xmath8 resonance region .",

    "a second order polynomial should therefore be a good approximation for the roper contribution in the region of interest .",
    "indeed , a corresponding fit gives already an excellent reproduction of our data .",
    "inclusion of a lorentzian representing a potential @xmath8 contribution gives an improvement only , if a tiny negative contribution is allowed .    in order to get the right curvature at the low - energy side",
    ", we next included also the data of dakhno _ et al .",

    "these produce only a slightly stronger curvature in the region of our data .",
    "the fit , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] by the dashed line , yields an excellent description of both data sets .",
    "inclusion of a potential @xmath8 contribution in the fit leads again to a negative resonance strength with a peak value of @xmath68 @xmath12b ( solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .    that way we arrive at an upper limit of 180 @xmath12b at the 90  @xmath13 confidence level .",
    "this corresponds to an upper limit for the branching ratio of 9 @xmath13 for the @xmath8 decay into the @xmath29 channel .",
    "this limit is much below the expectation , if @xmath8 would be dominantly a @xmath61 configuration . as discussed in the introduction , for this case we expected a @xmath8 contribution of more than 1 mb .",
    "hence this upper limit means that only less than 14 @xmath13 of the @xmath8 decay can proceed via a @xmath61 configuration .    for the scenario , where the @xmath8 decay proceeds via the @xmath69 configuration ,",
    "our derived upper limit is not as stringent and restricts such a configuration only to less than 50 @xmath13 .",
    "our result is compatible with a recent proposal to consider @xmath8 as a compact hexaquark configuration surrounded by a molecule - like @xmath69 configuration @xcite .",
    "it is , of course , also compatible with a pure hexaquark scenario , where the predicted @xmath70 decay rate is as small as 1 - 3@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the isoscalar single - pion production in @xmath14 collisions has been extracted from simultaneous measurements of the @xmath32 and @xmath0 reactions in the energy range @xmath3 = 0.95 - 1.3 gev ( @xmath5 = 2.3 - 2.46 gev ) .",
    "the obtained isoscalar cross sections in the region of 5 mb  the first ones in this energy range  fit well to earlier gatchina results @xcite at lower energies , but less to more recent ones @xcite .",

    "the measured energy dependence of the isoscalar cross section gives no evidence for a decay of the dibaryon resonance @xmath8 into the isoscalar @xmath29 channel .",
    "the derived upper limit excludes the proposed @xmath61 channel as a major intermediate decay configuration .",
    "it also restricts a possible @xmath69 configuration to less than 50 @xmath13 , but is in full accordance with quark - model calculations predicting a compact hexaquark configuration for @xmath8 . by these measurements",
