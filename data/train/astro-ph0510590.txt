    "radiation observed from astrophysical systems containing relativistic jets and shocks , e.g. , active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , and galactic microquasar systems usually has nonthermal emission spectra . in most of these systems , the emission is usually thought to be generated by accelerated electrons through the synchrotron ( jitter ) and/or inverse compton mechanisms .",
    "radiation from these systems is often observed in the radio through the gamma - ray region .",
    "radiation in optical and higher frequencies typically requires continual strong particle acceleration in order to counter radiative losses .",
    "it has been proposed that the needed particle acceleration occurs in shocks produced by differences in flow speed within the jet ( sometimes referred to as `` internal shocks '' ) ( e.g. , piran 2005 ) .",
    "particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations can shed light on the microphysical mechanism of particle acceleration that occurs in the complicated dynamics within relativistic shocks .",
    "recent pic simulations of relativistic electron - ion jets show acceleration occurring within the downstream jet , but not likely by the scattering of particles back and forth across the shock , as in fermi acceleration ( frederiksen et al .",

    "this ion current channel is surrounded by transverse toroidal magnetic fields indicated by the arrows in panel 3c .",
    "this large scale ( nearly the ion skin depth ( @xmath44 ) ) current channel is generated by the ion weibel instability .",
    "further investigation of the nonlinear evolution of the ion weibel instability requires a larger system such as @xmath45 ( e.g. , frederiksen et al .",
    "2004 ) , that can contain several current channels in the transverse direction and be sufficiently long to illustrate the spatial development .",
    "in addition to toroidal magnetic fields , radial electric fields accompany the charge separation associated with the current channels ( milosavljevi , naker , & spitkovsky 2005 ) .",
    "these electric fields are indicated by the arrows in panels 3a ( @xmath15 ) and 3b ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the electric and magnetic fields are approximately perpendicular in the @xmath36 plane .",
    "the @xmath11 component of @xmath0 in the simulation / ambient rest frame is mainly positive ( see panels 3c and 3d ) on the @xmath36 plane at this time and indicates the direction of motion of particles accelerated by the radial electric fields as modified by the lorentz force due to the transverse magnetic fields .",
    "it should be noted that the transient acceleration due to the radial electric field occurs within one gyromotion .",
    "therefore , the resultant motion is not identical to the @xmath0 drift which takes place over many gyromotions .",
    "still the sign of the @xmath11 component of @xmath0 gives an indication of the average effect of the radial and transverse magnetic fields on the ambient and jet particles .",
    "panels 3c and 3d which show that @xmath46 is typically in the @xmath47 direction in the ambient reference frame imply that ambient particles accelerated by the radial electric fields are directed by lorentz forces to move in the @xmath47 direction .",
    "thus , on average ambient particles are accelerated in the @xmath47 direction .",
    "the sign of @xmath46 depends on the frame of reference through the lorentz transformation , e.g. ,",
    "jackson ( 1999 ) , we have computed the value of @xmath48 in reference frames moving with @xmath49 where the third value corresponds to the initial jet particle velocity . the results for @xmath50 with @xmath51 relative to the simulation frame are shown in panels 3e and 3f . in panels 3e and 3f the arrows indicate the @xmath25 and @xmath32 components of the magnetic field in the moving reference frame . in these reference frames",
    "@xmath46 is mainly negative .",
    "the implication is that particles moving with these higher speeds , when accelerated by the radial electric fields , are on average directed by lorentz forces to move in the @xmath52 direction in this moving reference frame . in the ambient reference frame",
    "this appears as a deceleration . in reality , both spatial and temporal variation in filament structure produces more than a simple average acceleration or deceleration along the flow , and more than simple scattering into the transverse direction . the complicated nature of the particle motion and the acceleration process accompanying the filament structure is illustrated and discussed in hededal et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the phase space distribution of jet and ambient electrons in order to establish how particle acceleration is related to magnetic and electric field spatial development associated with the weibel instability . the value of @xmath48 in a frame moving with @xmath53 becomes more strongly negative in the electron - ion case ( fig .",
    "3e ) than in electron - positron case ( fig .",
    "consequently , a larger average deceleration of jet electrons occurs in the electron - ion case than in electron - positron case shown in panels 4a and 4b . in the electron - ion case ,",
    "jet electrons are accelerated in the parallel direction at @xmath54 not too far behind the jet head ( panel 4a ) .",
    "the largest perpendicular acceleration occurs at @xmath55 where the magnetic field energy achieves a local maximum ( see fig .",
    "behavior is qualitatively similar to the electron - positron case but maximum values are somewhat reduced .",
    "additionally , the electron - positron case clearly saturates by this simulation time .",
    "panel 4d clearly shows a linear acceleration region ( @xmath56 ) , a nonlinear region ( @xmath57 ) , and a jet head region ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "the nonlinear region is contained between the two magnetic field energy peaks at @xmath59 270 & 540 shown in figure 2d . by comparison development in the electron - ion case is affected by the transverse dimensions of the grid , i.e. , one current channel fills the grid transversely beyond the magnetic energy maximum at @xmath60 . with",
    "this restriction removed , it seems likely that even larger differences would appear between the electron - ion case and electron - positron case ( hededal et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the parallel acceleration of ambient electrons is shown in panels 4e",
    "( @xmath15 ) and 4f ( @xmath26 ) . at the time @xmath61",
    "the ambient electrons in the electron - ion case are not accelerated nearly as much as those in the electron - positron case .",
    "it seems likely that ambient ion inertia restricts ambient electron parallel acceleration , and the ion weibel instability is not fully excited ( e.g. , hededal et al .",
    "this lack of parallel acceleration can also be a result of insufficient transverse grid dimension . by comparison , in the electron - positron case positrons have the same mass as electrons and the ambient electrons and positrons",
    "are fully involved in the weibel instability with our present grid dimensions .",
    "we need to examine the particle momentum distributions in order to determine whether the instability results in a thermal or a power law distribution .",
    "additionally , it is necessary to examine the particle momentum distributions in the parallel and transverse directions as particle acceleration need not lead to an isotropic distribution .",
    "figure 5 shows momentum distributions of jet electrons at time @xmath24 .",
    "parallel momentum , @xmath62 , distributions are shown in panels ( a ) @xmath15 and ( b ) @xmath26 and perpendicular momentum distributions , @xmath63 are shown in panels ( c ) @xmath15 and ( d ) @xmath26 . in the panels",
    "the blue curves show the distribution of jet electrons found by plotting one third of the jet electrons in a portion of the grid near to the inlet ( @xmath64 ) and provides a reasonable indication of the initial injected electron distribution .",
    "the red curves show the momentum distribution of jet electrons found by plotting one third of the jet electrons from a region behind the jet front ( @xmath65 ) and indicates the accelerated electron distribution .",
    "all distributions are plotted in the ambient / simulation rest frame .",
    "the distribution of a lorentz - boosted thermal electron population is also plotted in figure 5 as dashed green curves . here",
    "we use a bi - maxwellian distribution function of the form ( see qin et al.2005 ) @xmath66\\exp[-(\\gamma_{\\rm",
    "v}m_{\\rm e}v_{\\perp})^{2}/(2\\gamma_{\\rm u}m_{\\rm e } k t_{\\perp}]~,\\ ] ] where @xmath67 , @xmath68 is the lorentz factor for electrons , and @xmath69 is the bulk ( averaged ) lorentz factor .",
    "this particular form presupposes that the electrons are `` cold '' , i.e. , @xmath70 , in the jet rest frame . the parallel and perpendicular thermal distributions that provide a best fit to the observed parallel and perpendicular distributions are calculated separately but use the same bulk lorentz factor , @xmath71 .",
    "the bulk lorentz factor , different for the electron - ion and electron - positron cases , is found by fitting the parallel momentum distributions ( red curves in panels ( 5a ) and ( 5b ) .",
    "note that the perpendicular velocity of jet electrons appears as a secondary effect through @xmath72 in the parallel momentum distributions .",
    "our best fits require a bulk lorentz boost of @xmath73 3.0 and 3.8 for @xmath15 and @xmath26 cases , respectively , i.e. , more electron slowing for the electron - ion case .",
    "the accompanying parallel temperatures are @xmath74 and @xmath75 for @xmath15 and @xmath26 cases , respectively , i.e , hotter for the electron - ion case . the accompanying perpendicular temperatures are @xmath76 and @xmath77 for @xmath15 and @xmath26 cases , respectively , i.e. , again hotter for the electron - ion case . in both @xmath15 and @xmath26 cases @xmath78 .",
    "note that these fitted temperatures imply a `` warm '' jet electron plasma , i.e. , @xmath79 , and formally the assumption that the temperatures are cold is violated .",
    "nevertheless , the comparisons remain qualitatively if not quantitatively robust .",
    "the electron - ion case shows a significant hump at @xmath80 , which is found in the parallel velocity distribution for the electron - ion case ( panel 5a ) . the electron - positron case ( panel 5b )",
    "shows a smoother higher energy tail without a noticeable hump",
    ". the hump could be due to more effective acceleration near the jet head ( near @xmath81 ) as shown in fig .",
    "4a , also indicated by fig . 2 in hededal et al.(2004 ) .",
    "this more effective acceleration in the electron - ion case is also indicated by the higher fitted perpendicular temperature in the electron - ion case ( see panels 5c and 5d ) .",
    "the differences in parallel and perpendicular momentum distributions between electron - ion and electron - positron cases provides a potential discriminator between electron - ion and electron - positron shocks .",
    "in particular , differences in the momentum distributions will appear as differences in the radiation spectrum ( hededal 2005 , hededal & nordlund 2005 ) .",
    "such potential spectral differences will be in addition to more subtle differences induced by differences in magnetic field strength and structure .",
    "we have performed self - consistent , three - dimensional relativistic particle simulations of relativistic electron - positron and electron - ion jets propagating into unmagnetized electron - positron and electron - ion ambient plasmas , respectively .",
    "the present simulations were performed using a larger simulation system and for a longer time compared to our previous simulations ( nishikawa et al .",
    "2003 , 2005 ) .",
    "the larger grid and longer time allowed us to investigate the nonlinear development of the weibel instability and the accompanying acceleration mechanism .",
    "the weibel instability forms current filaments and accompanying transverse toroidal magnetic fields around the current filaments .",
    "electrons deflected by the perturbed ( small ) transverse magnetic fields accompanying the current filaments subsequently enhance the current filaments ( weibel 1959 ; medvedev & loeb 1999 ; brainerd 2000 ; gruzinov 2001 ) .",
    "the acceleration of particles by electric fields toward or away from the current filaments and deflection of particles due to the lorentz force increases as the magnetic field perturbation grows in amplitude .",
    "basically we see that the transient force due to the radial electric field with circular magnetic field leads to acceleration in the perpendicular direction relative to the initial motion , and an average deceleration in the parallel direction but with an acceleration of some electrons in the parallel direction to produce a high energy thermal distribution .",
    "it should be noted that the weibel instability is convective , i.e. , the real part of the frequency is zero and current filaments grow temporally in the appropriate rest frame ( medvedev & loeb 1999 ; nishikawa et al.2003 , 2005 ) . in our simulations",
    "the values of @xmath82 fluctuate highly in a spatial sense in both ambient and jet reference frames .",
    "our results here are consistent with results from previous simulations ( frederiksen et al .  2003 , 2004 ;",
    "hededal et al .",
    "2004 ; nishikawa et al .",
    "2003 , 2005 ; hededal & nishikawa 2005 ) .",
    "the present simulations show no clear sign of fermi acceleration and the main acceleration of electrons takes place in the transition region behind the jet head .",
    "processes in the relativistic collisionless shock are dominated by current structures produced by the weibel instability .",
    "this instability is first excited near to the jet injection plane and grows spatially from smaller to larger current filaments behind the propagating jet front .",
    "radial electric fields accompany the development of current channels and toroidal transverse magnetic fields around the current channels .",
    "the toroidal magnetic and radial electric fields associated with the current filaments accelerate and decelerate jet electrons and positrons . in the electron - positron case",
    "the organized current channels and accompanying fields reach a maximum and then dissipate and become more disordered .",
    "particle acceleration / deceleration effects decrease in the dissipation region behind the jet front . here",
    "we note that other new simulations ( see nishikawa et al.2005a ) show that the level of magnetic field in the dissipation region depends on the initial jet lorentz factor or the lorentz factor distribution .",
    "on average bulk jet electron motion is decelerated in the parallel direction while some jet particles are accelerated in the parallel direction to form a nearly thermal distribution ( @xmath26 ) or a thermal distribution with a hump in higher energy ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "deceleration in the parallel direction is accompanied by large acceleration in the perpendicular directions .",
    "the ambient electron - positron medium is on average accelerated in the jet direction in the interaction . in the electron - ion case",
    "the instability evolves spatially similar to the electron - positron case but here large scale ion current channels are ultimately generated by the ion weibel instability in the electron - ion jet ( see also frederiksen et al .  2004",
    "; hededal et al.2004 ) .",
    "in this case more bulk deceleration , a prominent humped high energy tail in the parallel direction , and more transverse acceleration occur for the jet electrons .",
    "very little acceleration of the ambient electrons in the electron - ion jet is observed on the simulation grid .",
    "it is clear that a larger simulation grid is necessary to follow non - linear development in the electron - ion case for a longer time .",
    "the efficiencies of conversion of bulk kinetic energy into radiation via synchrotron or `` jitter '' emission from relativistic shocks is determined by the magnetic field strength and structure , and by the electron energy distribution behind the shock ( medvedev 2000 ; hededal 2005 ) . whether the radiation is in the synchrotron or jitter regime depends only on the nature of the magnetic field .",
    "if the typical fluctuation spatial scale of the magnetic field is smaller than the expected gyro - orbit , and the magnetic field is turbulent ( power law distributed ) then the radiation is in the jitter regime ( hededal 2005 ; hededal & nordlund 2005 ) .",
    "the radiation spectrum from the accelerated electrons in the weibel generated electromagnetic field shows good agreement with observations ( piran 2005 ; hededal 2005 , hededal & nordlund 2005 ) .",
    "the fundamental microscopic characteristics of relativistic shocks are essential for a proper understanding of the prompt gamma - ray and afterglow emission in gamma - ray bursts , and also to an understanding of the particle reacceleration processes and emission from the shocked regions in relativistic agn jets .",
    "obviously the accelerated particle distribution both parallel and perpendicular to the bulk motion needs to be known and , in particular the generation of magnetic field and its structure in the shock needs to be known .",
    "since the shock dynamics is complex and subtle at the microscopic level , more comprehensive studies are required to better understand the acceleration of electrons , the generation of magnetic fields , magnetic field structure and the associated emission .",
    "this further study will provide the insight into basic relativistic collisionless shock characteristics needed to provide a firm physical basis for modeling the emission from shocks in relativistic flows .",
