    "the phase transition from partonic degrees of freedom ( quarks and gluons ) to interacting hadrons is a central topic of modern high - energy physics @xcite . in order to understand the dynamics and relevant scales of this transition laboratory experiments under controlled conditions",
    "are presently performed with ultra - relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "hadronic spectra and relative hadron abundances from these experiments reflect important aspects of the dynamics in the hot and dense zone formed in the early phase of the reaction . here different quark flavors ( @xmath10 ) - as constituents of the final hadrons - provide valuable information on the early high density phase due to the substantial different mass scales for the light ( @xmath11 ) , strange ( @xmath12 ) and charm ( @xmath13 ) or bottom ( @xmath14 ) quarks .",
    "furthermore , as has been proposed early by rafelski and mller @xcite in particular the strangeness degree of freedom might play an important role in distinguishing hadronic and partonic dynamics .",
    "lattice qcd calculations at vanishing quark chemical potential and finite temperature indicate critical energy densities for the formation of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) of @xmath3 0.7 - 1 gev/@xmath15 @xcite , which might already be achieved at alternating gradient synchrotron ( ags ) energies of @xmath3 10 @xmath0gev for central au+au collisions @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the recent lattice qcd calculations at finite quark chemical potential @xmath8 @xcite show a rapid increase of the thermodynamic pressure @xmath16 with temperature above the critical temperature @xmath17 for a phase transition ( or cross - over ) to the qgp .",
    "the problem is how to relate these numbers to observables from nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "estimates based on the bjorken formula @xcite for the energy density achieved in central au+au collisions suggest that the critical energy density for the formation of a qgp of @xmath3 0.7 - 1 gev/@xmath15 is by far exceeded during a few fm / c in the initial phase of au+au collisions at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) energies @xcite .",
    "accordingly , a phase transition ( or cross - over ) might already happen at much lower bombarding energies .",
    "experimentally , relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions have been studied at beam energies from 0.1 to 2 @xmath0gev at the schwerionen - synchrotron ( sis ) , from 2 to 11.6 @xmath0gev at the ags and from 20 to 160 @xmath0gev at the super proton synchrotron ( sps ) @xcite .",
    "this program has been extended @xcite at rhic with au+au collisions at invariant energies @xmath18 from @xmath19 to 200 gev ( equivalent energies in a fixed target experiment : 0.2 to 21.3 @xmath0tev ) .    whereas many previous experimental studies have focused on longitudinal rapidity distributions for hadrons , the transverse mass ( or momentum ) spectra of hadrons are presently in the center of interest .",
    "on the one hand a significant suppression of high transverse momentum hadrons in au+au collisions compared to @xmath1 is observed at rhic energies of @xmath20 200 gev @xcite .",
    "this suppression is often attributed to the energy loss of highly energetic particles in a hot colored medium ( qgp ) @xcite .",
    "in fact , the recent observation by the phenix @xcite , star @xcite and brahms @xcite collaborations , that a similar suppression is not observed in d+au interactions at midrapidities at the same energy , supports this idea .",
    "on the other hand , the measured transverse mass ( @xmath21 ) spectra of hadrons ( heavier than pions ) @xmath22 at ags , sps and rhic energies show a substantial _ hardening _ in central au+au collisions relative to @xmath1 interactions ( cf .",
    "this hardening of the spectra ( or increase of the inverse slope parameter @xmath9 in ( [ slope ] ) ) for low transverse mass or momentum is commonly attributed to strong collective flow , which is absent in the respective @xmath1 or @xmath2 collisions .",
    "the authors of @xcite have proposed to interpret the approximately constant @xmath6 slopes above @xmath23 a@xmath4gev  the step  as an indication for a phase transition .",
    "this interpretation is also based on a rather sharp maximum in the @xmath7 ratio at @xmath3 20 to 30 a@xmath4gev in central of pb+pb collisions ( the horn @xcite ) .",
    "however , the present body of experimental data and our theoretical understanding does not allow for a stringent conclusion based only on the step and horn phenomena .",
    "in this paper we will address some further theoretical issues , but would like to point out that more experimental data , for example on collisions in the energy range of @xmath24  gev and on weakly interacting hadrons , will be needed to clarify these issues from the experimental side .",
    "we will demonstrate in this work , that neither the pressure needed to generate a large collective flow  to explain the hard slopes of the @xmath6 spectra with a plateau at sps energies  nor the experimental sharp maximum in the @xmath7 ratio at @xmath3 20 to 30 a@xmath4gev is produced in the present transport models by the interactions of hadrons in the expansion phase of the hadronic fireball .",
    "some aspects of this work have been published in refs .",
    "@xcite before ; however , we here extend the previous studies to rhic energies and consider a wide variety of dynamical scenarios .",
    "in particular we will explore two distinct effects : i ) initial state cronin enhancement and ii ) heavy resonance formation on the transverse mass spectra of pions and kaons at all bombarding energies from lower ags to rhic energies .    in our studies we use two independent relativistic transport models that employ hadronic and string degrees of freedom , i.e. urqmd @xcite and hsd @xcite .",
    "they take into account the formation and multiple rescattering of hadrons and thus dynamically describe the generation of pressure in the hadronic expansion phase .",
    "this involves also interactions of leading pre - hadrons that contain a valence quark ( antiquark ) from a primary hard collision ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in the parton language",
    ", the two transport models employed do not include gluon degrees of freedom explicitly nor gluon - gluon and gluon - quark ( antiquark ) interactions .",
    "we will use these models to test , whether the description of nucleus - nucleus reactions in terms of pre - hadronic , hadronic and string degrees of freedom and their interactions is sufficient to explain the experimental data .",
    "our work is organized as follows : in section ii we briefly recall the ingredients of the hsd and urqmd transport approaches and point out the extensions incorporated in urqmd ( versions 2.0 and 2.1 ) . in section",
    "iii the calculated excitation functions for pions , @xmath6 mesons and hyperons for central au+au ( or pb+pb ) collisions from 2 to 21300 a@xmath4gev are shown ( in comparison to the experimental data ) as well as selected particle ratios .",
    "section iv is devoted to transverse mass spectra of pions and @xmath6 mesons from @xmath1 to @xmath2 and central @xmath25 reactions in the same energy range . in section",
    "v we will discuss various alternative scenarios within the transport calculations to explore their sensitivity to the hadron transverse mass spectra .",
    "section vi is devoted to a study of the cronin effect in central au+au collisions , which we attribute to a pre - hadronic initial state scattering effect that also shows up in @xmath2 reactions .",
    "section vii includes a comparison of the thermodynamic lagrange parameters @xmath9 and @xmath26 extracted from the urqmd transport model in the central overlap regime of au+au collisions with the experimental systematics on chemical freeze - out configurations in the @xmath27 plane as well as recent lattice qcd results .",
    "section viii closes this study with a summary and discussion of open problems .",
    "we use two independent relativistic transport approaches for our study that employ hadronic and string degrees of freedom , i.e. urqmd ( ultra - relativistic quantum molecular dynamics ) @xcite and hsd ( hadron - string dynamics ) @xcite in order to obtain an estimate of systematic uncertainties within the transport models .",
    "both approaches take into account the formation and decay of strings as well as the multiple rescattering of hadrons in the expansion phase .",
    "these models can be considered as appropriate descriptions at least for the final stage of an ultrarelativistic nucleus - nucleus collision , where the strongly interacting hadrons dominate .",
    "the open question is , however , if these transport models also incorporate the proper degrees of freedom in the very early phase of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "we stress that transport calculations allow for a systematic study of the change in the dynamics from elementary baryon - baryon or meson - baryon collisions to proton - nucleus reactions or from peripheral to central nucleus - nucleus collisions in a unique way without change in parameters .",
    "this is of central importance since the assumptions of thermal and chemical equilibrium ",
    "as used in hydrodynamical or statistical models @xcite  do not necessarily hold in all these reactions and the transport studies allow to explore the amount of ( thermal or chemical ) equilibrium reached @xcite .",
    "the default urqmd 1.3 transport approach @xcite includes all baryonic resonances up to masses of 2 gev as well as mesonic resonances up to 1.9 gev as tabulated by the particle data group @xcite . for hadronic continuum excitations",
    "a string model is used with meson formation times of the order of 1 - 2  fm / c depending on the momentum and energy of the created hadron .",
    "for the present study  and the particular aim to address also jet production and fragmentation at rhic energies  we additionally have incorporated pythia ( v 6.1 ) @xcite in urqmd 1.3 similar to hsd . this novel and",
    "extended version we denote as urqmd 2.0 .",
    "moreover , to explore the physical consequences of higher mass states as implemented in the relativistic - quantum - molecular - dynamics model ( rqmd ) @xcite , we have introduced in urqmd additional high mass resonances that are explicitly produced and propagated in _ s - channel _ processes with invariant masses up to @xmath28  gev .",
    "we do not assume these states to be excited in baryon - baryon collisions .",
    "in practical terms : if the mass of the produced mesonic or baryonic resonance is above @xmath29  gev , i.e in the continuum , the formed resonance state is not fragmented as a string object like in urqmd 1.3 or urqmd 2.0 .",
    "we recall that a string of invariant mass 2 @xmath30 3 gev essentially decays to a few pions , a vector meson + pions etc . instead",
    ", this high mass state is treated as a quasi - particle that decays according to the branching ratios of the resonances with a mass of 1.9 to 2.0 gev ( as implemented in urqmd ) .",
    "we recall that baryon resonances @xmath3 1.9 gev dominantly decay to the @xmath31 channel and with some lower probability to the @xmath32 final state . in this way",
    "light meson emission is suppressed by about 25% compared to a string of the same invariant mass .",
    "we note , that this recipe is still in line with the available @xmath33 data on pion multiplicities . furthermore , since the high mass resonances decay isotropically in their rest frame , this leads to an enhancement of transverse flow ( cf .",
    "section v.e ) .",
    "furthermore , we use isotropic angular distributions for elastic meson - baryon interactions below @xmath34 gev . in this work",
    "we will denote this scenario as urqmd 2.1 .    in the hsd approach nucleons , @xmath35 s , n@xmath36(1440 ) , n@xmath36(1535 ) , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 hyperons , @xmath40 s , @xmath41 s and @xmath42 s as well as their antiparticles",
    "are included on the baryonic side whereas the @xmath43 and @xmath44 octet states are included in the mesonic sector .",
    "inelastic hadron ",
    "hadron collisions with energies above @xmath45 2.6  gev are described by the fritiof model @xcite ( incorporating pythia v 5.5 with jetset v 7.3 for the production and fragmentation of jets @xcite ) whereas low energy hadron ",
    "hadron collisions are modeled in line with experimental cross sections @xcite .",
    "both transport approaches reproduce the nucleon - nucleon , meson - nucleon and meson - meson cross section data in a wide kinematic range @xcite .",
    "therefore , we expect that the hadronic scattering mechanisms are sufficiently under control .",
    "however , in nucleus - nucleus reactions further elastic and inelastic processes on the parton level might occur that  beyond the interactions of leading",
    "quarks / diquarks  are not included in the studies below .",
    "we mention that ( pqcd - like ) partonic scattering is incorporated e.g. in the multi - phase transport model ( ampt ) @xcite , which is currently employed from upper sps to rhic energies , but is not suitable for lower energies .",
    "whereas the underlying concepts of the transport theoretical models are very similar , the actual realizations differ considerably . a systematic analysis of results from both models and experimental data for central nucleus - nucleus collisions from 2 to 160 @xmath0gev has shown that the longitudinal rapidity distributions of protons , pions , kaons , antikaons and hyperons are quite similar in both models and in reasonable agreement with available data @xcite .",

    "urqmd 2.1 follows the results from urqmd 1.3 at ags and sps energies but then increases slightly up to rhic energies . in case of hsd a continuously rising ratio with bombarding energy is found for the midrapidity ratios .",
    "this rise up to the full rhic energy is essentially due to an underestimation of the pion yield at midrapidity ( cf .",
    "fig . 1 in ref .",
    "the 4@xmath49 ratio in hsd , which is approximately constant from top sps to rhic energies , is larger than the ratio from urqmd 1.3 due to the lower amount of pion production and a slightly higher @xmath50 yield ( cf .",
    "[ fig_yield ] ) .",
    "we note that the lower amount of pions in hsd is essentially due to an energy - density cut ( in the local rest frame ) , which does not allow hadron formation when is energy density is above 1 gev/@xmath15 .    despite this seemingly good description of the separate particle yields , the experimentally observed maximum in the @xmath7 ratio at 20 - 30 a@xmath4gev",
    "is not reproduced in the models .",
    "due to strangeness conservation , the same arguments hold for the @xmath55 ratio , where the pronounced experimental maxima are underestimated due to the excess of pions in the transport models at top ags energies ( for hsd ) and above @xmath3 5 a@xmath4gev ( for urqmd 1.3 ) .",
    "here urqmd 2.1 performs better in the ratios due to the lower amount of pions produced by the high resonance decays . since the @xmath56 yields are well described by all approaches ( cf .",

    "the deviations in the @xmath57 ratios at sps and rhic energies in urqmd 1.3 indeed can be traced back to the excess of pions .",
    "this suggests that the entropy production , which is reflected in the pion to baryon ratio at these energies , is overestimated in urqmd 1.3 ( and hsd ) above @xmath3 5 a@xmath4gev in central au+au collisions .",
    "note , that in urqmd 2.1 the entropy production is reduced by the generation of high mass states in @xmath12-channels , which essentially decay by emitting a lower amount of pions .",
    "it has been discussed in the community @xcite , that the maximum in the @xmath7 ratio might be due to isospin effects in au+au ( pb+pb ) collisions arising from a different rapidity dependence of @xmath58 and @xmath59 quarks in @xmath1 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 collisions .",

    "additional self energy contributions stem from @xmath6 interactions with mesons which become increasingly important for higher bombarding energies ; however , @xmath12-wave kaon - pion interactions are weak due to chiral symmetry arguments and @xmath92-wave interactions such as @xmath93 transitions are suppressed substantially by the approximately thermal pion spectrum .",
    "a recent study on the kaon potentials in hot pion matter gives kaon mass shifts of about @xmath94 mev and vector potentials of @xmath95 mev @xcite for a pion gas at temperature @xmath9= 170 mev .",
    "we have employed even slightly larger @xmath6 potentials in dynamical hsd calculations and achieved a hardening of the @xmath6 spectra by less than 10% .",
    "furthermore , we have pursued the idea of refs .",
    "@xcite that the @xmath6 spectra could be hardened by string - string interactions , which increase the effective string tension @xmath96 and thus the probability to produce mesons at high @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "a related suggestion has been put forward in @xcite .    in order to estimate the largest possible effect of string - string interactions we have assumed that for two overlapping strings the string tension @xmath96 is increased by a factor of two , for three overlapping strings by a factor of three etc . here",
    "the overlap of strings is defined geometrically assuming a transverse string radius @xmath97 , which according to the studies in ref .",
    "@xcite should be @xmath98 0.25 fm .",
    "additionally an overlap of the strings in longitudinal direction is required which , however , does not involve any new parameter since the dynamics of the string ends is directly available from the hsd transport calculations .",
    "based on these assumptions ( and @xmath97=0.25 fm as in refs .",
    "@xcite ) , we find only a small increase of the inverse slope parameters at ags energies , where the string densities are low ( dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig_scenar ] in comparison to the default calculations ( solid lines ) ) . at sps and rhic",
    "energies the model gives a hardening of the spectra by about 15% which , however , is still too low in comparison to the data in fig .",
    "[ fig_mtaa ] . despite of the large number of initial strings in central au+au collisions at sps or rhic energies , their average eigenvolume ( in the rest frame at break up ) is low ( @xmath99 @xmath15 ) compared to the eigenvolume of a nucleon ( @xmath100 @xmath15 ) due to the fast string fragmentation process .",
    "consequently the critical density of color neutral strings may be about 7 times higher than the critical density of nucleons with respect to a phase transition induced by percolation @xcite .",
    "we have examined another possibility which we denote as parton elastic scattering. to this end we have included elastic scattering of unformed hadrons in the initial phase of the reaction  before they actually evolve to their full hadronic size  employing the elastic pion - nucleon cross section per quark degree of freedom .",
    "the results of these simulations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_scenar ] by the dotted lines which give a much better reproduction of the experimental spectra at @xmath18 = 200 gev , that are even slightly overestimated .",
    "the drawback on the other side is that the hadron rapidity spectra now are overestimated by @xmath3 20% relative to the default calculation ( and the experimental data ) .",
    "the increase in the slope parameter especially for @xmath6 spectra at ags and sps energies , however , is only moderate and a significant discrepancy remains with respect to the experimental spectra .",
    "following a further idea of ref .",
    "@xcite we explore the possibility that the fragmentation of strings from @xmath101 collisions modifies in the dense and hot medium .",
    "an extreme modification amounts to assume an isotropic decay of @xmath101 strings  as employed in the rqmd model @xcite  which leads to a reduction of longitudinal hadron momenta and an enhancement of their transverse momenta .",
    "the results of these simulations are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig_scenar ] for the transverse mass spectra of pions , kaons and antikaons ( dot - dashed lines ) .",
    "apparently , this modified fragmentation function leads to much better results in comparison to experiment ( cf .",
    "dot - dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig_scenar ] ) .",
    "the drawback with this scenario , however , is that the approximate agreement with the longitudinal rapidity distributions for @xmath102 and protons is destroyed as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_y160iso ] for 5% central pb+pb reactions at 160 a@xmath4gev . here",
    "the solid lines correspond to the default hsd calculations whereas the dashed lines stand for the calculations with an isotropic decay of @xmath101 strings .",
    "obviously , the latter scenario leads to an enhanced stopping of the nuclei and larger meson production , which is not supported very much by the data .",
    "we admit , that a slightly more isotropic decay of the @xmath101 strings ( with respect to the default calculations ) would be favored by the experimental data ; however , we do not aim at fitting data here .",
    "we mention - without explicit representation - that the comparison shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_y160iso ] for central collisions at 160 a@xmath4gev holds qualitatively also at ags and rhic energies .      a further possibility to harden",
    "the meson and nucleon spectra in a coupled - channel transport approach is to introduce higher mass baryon resonances with masses @xmath103 gev as in rqmd @xcite , that decay isotropically and dominantly couple to the @xmath104 channel and not to multipion + nucleon channels .",
    "as described in section ii , the version urqmd 2.1 has been set up to incorporate this possibility and to explore its consequences . since the massive",
    "resonances decay isotropically in their rest frame , this leads to enhanced transverse flow as found in the previous subsection . the penalty of enhanced hadron production ( cf .",
    "[ fig_y160iso ] ) is cured in urqmd 2.1 since the high mass resonance decays produce 25% less particles as compared to a string of the same invariant mass . in this way one can produce larger hadron transverse momenta in the transport calculations without increasing the meson multiplicities on average .",
    "such a prescription fits the data in the ags and sps energy regime very well ( similar to rqmd @xcite ) .",
    "however , the open question remains , if such states could be identified in meson - baryon scattering and , furthermore , if they would survive in a dense hadronic medium .    in fig .",

    "indeed , the description of the pion and @xmath6 improves substantially in urqmd 2.1 relative to urqmd 2.0 ( and hsd ) at ags and sps energies .",
    "however , the penalty here is that now the spectra at the top rhic energy are overestimated at high transverse mass for pions and antikaons .",
    "moreover , the improvement in the spectral slope for pions and kaons at ags and sps energies in urqmd 2.1 does not go along with an improvement in the rapidity spectra as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_y160u21 ] .",
    "though the @xmath77 rapidity distribution can be well described for 5% central pb+pb reactions at 160 a@xmath4gev due to the reduction of pion production in the decay scheme of the high mass states , the rapidity spectra of @xmath6 mesons are also lower in urqmd 2.1 ( solid lines ) compared to urqmd 2.0 ( dashed lines ) and the data .",
    "the proton stopping at midrapidity is not much affected by the introduction of the high mass states since they do not couple to the baryon - baryon channel .",
    "we conclude , that the recipe of high mass states  as incorporated in urqmd similar to rqmd  does not solve the problem with the @xmath7 ratio .",
    "the cronin effect dates back to measurements of transverse hadron spectra from @xmath2 collisions at the sps and isr @xcite and relates to a ( moderate ) enhancement of transverse momentum spectra with increasing target mass @xmath82 .",
    "though the microscopic origin of this effect is not fully understood , most current interpretations are based on semi - hard initial state gluon radiation of the propagating quarks in the medium prior to a hard interaction vertex ( cf .",

    "[ fig_qcd ] demonstrates that the transport calculation show temperatures ( energy densities ) well above the phase boundary ( horizontal line with errorbars from ref .",

    "it is worth pointing out that a substantial hardening of the @xmath6 slope results from an initial state cronin enhancement at higher sps and rhic energies , that should not be attributed to collective flow ( or initial pressure ) .",
    "this cronin enhancement  as known experimentally from @xmath119 reactions at sps energies  does not signal a phase transition to a quark - gluon - plasma .    we thus have argued - in comparison to lattice qcd calculations at finite temperature and baryon chemical potential @xmath26 from refs . @xcite and @xcite as well as the experimental systematics in the chemical freeze - out parameters ( cf .",
    "[ fig_qcd ] )  that the missing pressure should be generated in the early phase of the collision by nonperturbative partonic interactions because the strong hadronic interactions do nt produce it in the later stages .",

    "<S> we investigate hadron production as well as transverse hadron spectra from proton - proton , proton - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions from 2 @xmath0gev to 21.3 @xmath0tev within two independent transport approaches ( hsd and urqmd ) that are based on quark , diquark , string and hadronic degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison to experimental data on transverse mass spectra from @xmath1 , @xmath2 and c+c ( or si+si ) reactions shows the reliability of the transport models for light systems . for central au+au ( pb+pb ) collisions at bombarding energies above @xmath3 5 a@xmath4gev , </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the measured @xmath5 transverse mass spectra have a larger inverse slope parameter than expected from the default calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate various scenarios to explore their potential effects on the @xmath6 spectra . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the initial state cronin effect is found to play a substantial role at top sps and rhic energies . </S>",
    "<S> however , the maximum in the @xmath7 ratio at 20 to 30 a@xmath4gev is missed by  40% and the approximately constant slope of the @xmath6 spectra at sps energies is not reproduced either . </S>",
    "<S> our systematic analysis suggests that the additional pressure - as expected from lattice qcd calculations at finite quark chemical potential @xmath8 and temperature @xmath9- should be generated by strong interactions in the early pre - hadronic / partonic phase of central au+au ( pb+pb ) collisions . </S>"
