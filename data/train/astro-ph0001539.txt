    "thin discs are an important model for accretion flows in a number of different astrophysical objects , including active galactic nuclei , interacting binary systems , and young stars .",
    "most disc models are _ flat _ ,",
    "i.e. the disc is planar , for simplicity and because there has been little theoretical or observational motivation to consider non - coplanar , or _ warped _ discs  although observations of the accreting neutron star system her x-1 have long been interpreted as requiring a precessing disc that lies out of the plane of the binary system ( tananbaum et  al .",
    "1972 ; katz 1973 ; roberts 1974 ) .",
    "a pair of developments in the last few years now strongly motivates theoretical interest in warped discs .",
    "first , pringle ( 1996 ) found an instability of a thin disc model that tends to produce large scale warps .",
    "the instability is driven by radiation torques exerted on the disc as it is differentially illuminated by the central source and then re - radiates .",
    "second , the megamaser in the nucleus of ngc 4258 has been resolved by the vlba and can be understood as an almost precisely keplerian , but warped , thin disc .",
    "the maser spots trace out the position of the disc and allow accurate measurements of its distance , the mass of the central object , and the parameters of the warp ( miyoshi et  al .",
    "1995 ) . of course",
    ", warps may also be excited by direct forcing , e.g. by tidal interaction of a t tauri disc with a binary companion ( papaloizou & terquem 1995 ) .",
    "warps in unmagnetized , non - self - gravitating , inviscid keplerian discs are rather special , as we shall review in  3 below .",
    "this is because a warp ( with azimuthal wavenumber @xmath1 ) that is quasi - static in an inertial frame sets up vertically - varying horizontal pressure gradients in the disc that oscillate at the rotation frequency @xmath2 as viewed in a locally corotating frame . in keplerian discs",
    "this is resonant with the epicyclic frequency , and so modest warps can excite large amplitude motions ",
    "we shall call them _ in - plane oscillations _  in the disc . as a result , warps and bending waves",
    "propagate approximately non - dispersively , at nearly the sound speed , in a keplerian disc . in a non - keplerian disc ,",
    "the in - plane oscillations are much weaker and bending waves are dispersive ( papaloizou & lin 1995 ; ogilvie 1999 ) .",
    "the special nature of warps in keplerian discs raises a number of interesting astrophysical issues .",
    "are the in - plane oscillations stable ?",
    "we shall show via two different lines of analysis that they are not in  3 and  4 . for small warp amplitudes ,",
    "the warp is unstable to a parametric instability , a possibility presciently hinted at by papaloizou & terquem ( 1995 ) .",
    "next , what is the non - linear outcome of the instability ?",
    "this we explore numerically in  5 , which examines the immediate decay of an initially unstable warp .",
    "finally we discuss the implications of this for the disc of ngc 4258 in  6 , using a simple model for the interaction of the warp with the parametric instability .",
    "to analyse this putative instability of warps in discs , we need to formulate an equilibrium to perturb about . in doing",
    "so we shall make two seemingly severe approximations which we believe do not affect the existence or nature of the instability .",
    "first , we shall consider a radially local model of the disc , the well known shearing - sheet model ( goldreich & lynden - bell 1965 ) . in this approach the equations of motion are expanded to lowest order in @xmath3 ( @xmath4 being the disc scale height ) about some point corotating with the disc at @xmath5 .",
    "one then erects a local cartesian coordinate system @xmath6 rotating with uniform angular velocity @xmath7 . in this limit ,",
    "the momentum equation is @xmath8 the equilibrium velocity field is then @xmath9 , where @xmath10 for a keplerian disc .",
    "the continuity equation takes its usual form , and we shall , unless otherwise stated , assume an isothermal equation of state , @xmath11 .",
    "the equilibrium density state is then @xmath12 , with @xmath13 .",
    "notice that we have neglected magnetic fields completely . in a magnetized disc turbulence will develop due to the balbus - hawley instability ( balbus & hawley 1998 ) , and the analysis presented here will be invalid . in that case",
    "one must study the interaction of the resulting mhd turbulence with the warp , a project which , at present , can only be undertaken numerically ( torkelsson et  al . 2000 ) . in discs that are weakly magnetized the linear hydrodynamic analysis that follows",
    "will still be applicable over a limited range of wavevectors , although it seems likely that balbus - hawley initiated mhd turbulence will ultimately dominate .",
    "there may also be conditions under which astrophysical discs are so poorly ionized that they do not couple to the magnetic field ( cf .",
    "gammie 1996 ; gammie & menou 1998 ) .    our second approximation , which applies only to the analytical approaches used below and not to the numerical experiments , is axisymmetry for the bending waves and for the parasitic instabilities that feed on them .",
    "this may seem peculiar as the most astrophysically interesting warps have @xmath14 ; such modes have the unique property that they can be stationary in an inertial frame , and furthermore are what is observed in the unique megamaser disc in ngc 4258 .",
    "nevertheless @xmath14 modes are `` almost axisymmetric '' in that @xmath15 , so it is consistent with the local approximation to neglect terms of this order and consider only axisymmetric bending waves for the basic state . to the extent that such terms are negligible , an @xmath1 mode with frequency @xmath16 and an axisymmetric mode with @xmath17 are locally indistinguishable because both have the same frequency in a frame corotating with the fluid .",
    "that we consider only axisymmetric parasitic instabilities on this basic state is perhaps a more questionable approximation , but one that we relax in the non - linear regime .",
    "to set the stage for the analysis that follows , we recount the theory of axisymmetric waves in isothermal discs ( lubow & pringle 1993 ; see also goodman 1993 ; ogilvie & lubow 1999 ) .",
    "we assume from the outset that both the vertical structure of the disc and its dynamical response are isothermal , so that @xmath18 and the brunt - visl  frequency vanishes .",
    "consider small , axisymmetric eulerian perturbations @xmath19 from the basic state , with time and space dependence @xmath20 $ ] understood .",
    "these perturbations obey @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the epicyclic frequency , given by @xmath25 .",
    "one can then obtain a single second - order equation for the pressure perturbation , @xmath26\\left({{\\delta p}\\over{\\rho}}\\right)=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the eigenfunctions are hermite polynomials , the solutions can also be expressed in terms of hermite polynomials , but with arguments depending on @xmath27 and @xmath28 . ]",
    "( e.g. abramowitz & stegun 1965 ) , @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is a non - negative integer .",

    "the eigenfunction @xmath40 has @xmath31 vertical nodes in @xmath41 and @xmath42 nodes in @xmath43 .",
    "the dispersion relation ( [ dispersion ] ) has two solutions ( both positive ) for @xmath44 at each @xmath31 : an `` acoustic '' branch with @xmath45 and an `` inertial '' branch with @xmath46 .",
    "the bending waves correspond to @xmath47 , and the density wave , for which @xmath48 and @xmath49 , lies on the acoustic branch at @xmath50 .    in the special case of a keplerian disc , @xmath51",
    ", the bending - wave branches cross over at @xmath52 with non - vanishing group velocities @xmath53 .",
    "this happens because of the coincidence of the natural frequencies of horizontal and vertical oscillations .",
    "a disturbance with long wavelength , @xmath54 , is simultaneously close to the lindblad and vertical resonance conditions .",
    "the form of the dispersion relation for small @xmath55 is @xmath56 and the normalized eigenfunction in this limit is @xmath57 the physical velocity field , with arbitrary normalization , is @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a measure of the shear rate in the warp .",
    "this velocity perturbation consists of two parts .",
    "the vertical motion is simply a uniform oscillation at the vertical frequency ( which , in a keplerian disc , is equal to the orbital frequency ) . in a disc with an @xmath1 warp , ( @xmath60 ) provided that @xmath28 is understood as the frequency seen in a locally corotating frame .",
    "] it corresponds to the fluid following an inclined circular orbit .",
    "this motion can be eliminated by redefining the frame of reference to follow the inclined orbit , with the result that only the horizontal components of ( [ deltav ] ) remain .",
    "the horizontal motion is in fact an _ exact _ solution to the equations of motion in the shearing sheet , so @xmath61 can take on any value .",
    "we shall consider the stability of this motion ; it is in a sense a local model in azimuth and radius for the motion in a large scale , @xmath14 , warp .",
    "for the special case of a quasi - static @xmath1 warp in a keplerian disc , the disturbance can remain close to the lindblad - vertical resonance over the entire radial extent of the disc .    in the limit that the amplitude of the warp is very large , so that @xmath62 , the oscillatory character of the motion is not important and the problem reduces to the stability of a vertically linear shear flow .",
    "this problem was considered by kumar & coleman ( 1993 ) , who found it unstable .",
    "the stability problem is reduced to its simplest possible form if we assume that the fluid is incompressible , rather than isothermal , and neglect its stratification .",
    "the governing equations are the same as before , except that @xmath63 and the vertical gravity term is omitted in the equation of motion .",
    "the basic state is now regarded as infinite in both radial and vertical extent , and has uniform density and pressure .",
    "we divide the velocity field into three pieces : @xmath64 .",
    "the first piece , @xmath65 , is the differential rotation of the disc as it appears in the local model ; the second piece is the `` bending wave '' , given by the following exact solution to the equations of motion ( cf . equation [ deltav ] ) :    @xmath66    @xmath67    and @xmath68 . since the solution is exact , @xmath61 can be arbitrarily large .",
    "the third piece of the velocity field , @xmath69 , is the perturbation on the warp whose stability we wish to consider . in general",
    ", one might think of linearizing the equation of motion and projecting @xmath69 on to a suitable basis of functions .",
    "note that one can not find normal modes because the basic flow is itself time - dependent .",
    "however , a standard technique is available for an incompressible fluid if the strain tensor of the basic flow is independent of position ( kelvin 1887 ; craik & criminale 1986 ; bayly 1986 ) .",
    "here one considers a perturbation in the form of a fourier mode whose wavevector evolves in time according to the strain field .",
    "specifically , we take all perturbed quantities to be time - dependent amplitudes multiplied by @xmath70 $ ] , where @xmath71\\cdot{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ k$}}.\\ ] ] for an axisymmetric mode ( @xmath72 ) this gives @xmath73 so that @xmath74 . in words , then , these perturbing waves nod back and forth on top of the oscillating in - plane motions set up by the warp . in the absence of the warp , they would be inertial oscillations ( also called r modes ) with @xmath75 .    the amplitudes of the perturbations obey @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79 note that this is an exact solution since the non - linear self - interaction of the mode is zero .",
    "recall that @xmath80 is time - dependent .",
    "these equations can be reduced to a single floquet equation ( a linear equation with periodic coefficients ) of the form @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a function with period @xmath83 .",
    "first we assume that the shearing motion is small , in that @xmath84 .",
    "expanding @xmath85 in powers of @xmath86 , @xmath87 to this order the equation for the evolution of the perturbation is the mathieu equation , which has the normal form @xmath88 ( see , e.g. , bender & orszag 1978 ) .",
    "the mathieu equation is the classical model equation for _ parametric instability_. if @xmath89 , parametric instability sets in for @xmath90 , @xmath91 . here",
    "the mathieu equation describes the evolution of an inertial oscillation with initial wavevector @xmath92 and frequency @xmath93 , so @xmath94 .",
    "instability is then achieved by tuning @xmath92 so that @xmath95 , or equivalently , so that the inertial oscillation has frequency @xmath96 .",
    "the inertial oscillation is destabilized by its interaction with the warp , which has frequency @xmath2 .",
    "near @xmath95 the growth rate of the instability is @xmath97 .    applying these results to the warp , we find instability when @xmath98 , so the wavevector of the perturbed velocities is initially oriented at @xmath99 to the vertical",
    ". then @xmath100 the growing mode has growth rate @xmath101 i.e. the growth rate is proportional to the shear rate in the warp .",
    "if the shearing motion is not small , the floquet exponents and associated growth rate can still be obtained numerically .",
    "instead of using equation ( [ floquet ] ) , which is singular if @xmath61 is so large that @xmath80 passes through zero , one can integrate the coupled equations @xmath102 over a single period , starting from two linearly independent initial conditions .",
    "the result of this calculation is that , as @xmath61 increases , the growth rate @xmath103 increases less rapidly than a simple linear relation . for @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 , the growth rate ( maximized with respect to @xmath107 ) is @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 , respectively , of the value given in equation ( [ small_s ] ) .",
    "we remark that this calculation could easily be extended to non - axisymmetric modes , and viscosity could also be allowed for .",
    "however , the method is restricted to incompressible fluids .    in the case of a non - keplerian disc ( @xmath111 )",
    "the analysis is almost identical .",
    "provided that @xmath61 still measures the amplitude of the @xmath112-component of the epicyclic motion , @xmath113 , the floquet equation and growth rate are unchanged except that @xmath2 is replaced by @xmath24 .",
    "the main difference in the case of a non - keplerian disc is that the in - plane oscillations are more weakly coupled to the warp .",
    "this simple calculation strongly suggests that warped discs are hydrodynamically unstable , although it uses a model lacking compressibility and the vertical structure of the disc . in the next section",
    "we remove these limitations , at the price of a lengthier and less transparent analysis .",
    "parametric instability can be treated as a special case of three - mode coupling in which one of the three modes ( mode 1 ) has a prescribed motion , and hence can be regarded as a time - dependent component of the basic state upon which the other two modes ( 2 and 3 ) are treated as linear perturbations .. our expansion ( equations [ 37,38 ] ) assumes that the amplitude of modes 2 and 3 is @xmath114 , with @xmath115 . ] sometimes , as is the case here , the wavelength of mode 1 is much longer than that of mode 2 or 3 .    in the absence of dissipation , three - mode couplings are most easily calculated from an action principle , @xmath116 here @xmath117 indicates a first - order variation with respect to the displacements @xmath118 , which are regarded as functions of the spatial coordinates @xmath119 and time @xmath120 .",

    "consider a situation in which only three modes @xmath145 are significantly excited .",

    "the hamiltonian corresponding to ( [ threel ] ) has a local but not a global minimum at the origin , because the highest terms are odd in @xmath140 .",
    "when , as here , ( [ threel ] ) results from truncation of a physical system with a positive - definite hamiltonian , then quartic and perhaps higher terms must be retained if the amplitude or coupling is sufficiently large .",
    "\\2 . in the opposite limit of small amplitudes or weak coupling ,",
    "where the cubic term is small compared to the quadratic ones , non - linearity is important only if approximate resonance exists among the natural frequencies of the three linearized oscillators . without loss of generality , and we define @xmath149 , let @xmath150 .",
    "resonance exists if @xmath151 , and the accuracy of the resonance is characterized by the smallness of @xmath152 on the other hand , the strength of the coupling can be characterized by a dimensionless parameter such as @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the total energy of the system ( [ threel ] ) .",
    "@xmath155 , slow exchange of energy among the three oscillators can occur on time - scales @xmath156 provided @xmath157 .",
    "there is no general restriction on the amount of energy that can be exchanged , except that @xmath158 and that the energy in each oscillator , @xmath159 must remain positive .",
    "the selection rule ( [ selection ] ) can be explained , or at least remembered , by saying that a pair of quanta of action @xmath160 in oscillators @xmath161 and @xmath162 combine in pairs to make a single quantum in oscillator @xmath105 .",
    "\\4 . in the special case that all of the energy is initially in oscillator 1 , the energies of oscillators 2 and 3 grow exponentially at growth rate @xmath163 , where @xmath103 is the growth rate of their amplitudes .",
    "the maximum growth rate is achieved when @xmath164 : @xmath165 of course growth slows once a significant fraction of the total energy resides in oscillators 2 and 3 . if resonance is not exact , then the growth rate is @xmath166 and there is no growth at all where @xmath167 .    \\5 . finally , if dissipation is present so that the free decay rate of the amplitudes of oscillators 2 and 3 is @xmath168 , then formula ( [ genrate ] ) holds with @xmath169 replaced by @xmath170 .",
    "finding the parametric growth rate due to a large - scale bending mode reduces therefore to the evaluation of the coupling parameter @xmath171 given by equation ( [ coupling ] ) in terms of the linear eigenfunctions and eigenfrequencies @xmath172 . in a local approximation",

    "the growth rate ( [ maxrate ] ) reduces to @xmath205    in particular , for @xmath206 and @xmath207 , @xmath208 .",
    "this is exactly half the growth rate calculated in  [ floquet ] .",
    "the explanation appears to be that each daughter mode with @xmath209 and @xmath210 can participate in two parametric couplings : one with mode @xmath211 and the other with @xmath212 . at sufficiently large @xmath31 ,",
    "both of the resonance conditions @xmath213 can be satisfied with nearly equal accuracy . as a result , the growth rate of mode @xmath214 is doubled .    it is , of course , not obvious that the mode - coupling calculation should give the same answer as the floquet analysis of  4 , even after this correction .",
    "the gas considered here is compressible , whereas in  4 it was assumed incompressible . as @xmath215 ,",
    "however , the modes of interest , which belong to the `` inertial '' branch (  3 ) , are effectively incompressible near the mid - plane . at high altitudes ( @xmath216 )",
    "the inertial modes are nearly isobaric , and the local contribution to the coupling coefficient ( [ coupling ] ) varies with height .",
    "but when modes of many ( large ) values of @xmath31 and the same @xmath217 grow together , it can be shown that the relative phasing of the mode amplitudes demanded by parametric instability results in a total wavefunction that is concentrated toward the mid - plane .",
    "the analyses of   4 and 5 establish the existence of a linear instability of hydrodynamic warps .",
    "we would now like to understand the non - linear outcome of the instability , and its non - axisymmetric development , which was ignored in the analytic analysis . to do this , we have integrated the hydrodynamic equations in a series of numerical experiments .",

    "this test is non - trivial : for a naive implementation of the coriolis and tidal forces the amplitude of the epicycle will grow or decay .",
    "this is because the time - step determined from the courant condition depends on epicyclic phase .",

    "the dispersion relation is much more complicated , but can be expanded for small @xmath316 to obtain @xmath398 where the first term is the frequency in the inviscid case ( equation [ dispersion ] ) and @xmath399 is a dimensionless measure of the viscous damping rate of the mode . generally speaking , @xmath399 increases with increasing @xmath31 and @xmath27 .",
    "we therefore consider the first parametric resonance , which occurs between modes 1 and 2 ( i.e. @xmath400 ) at @xmath401 .",
    "the inviscid growth rate is then @xmath402 . at this point @xmath403 , giving a net growth rate of @xmath404 .",
    "the instability proceeds only if @xmath405 , which agrees closely with equation ( [ criterion ] ) ."
