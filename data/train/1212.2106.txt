    "observables sensitive to the substructure of energetic , ultra - massive jets hold great promise for distinguishing new physics signals from qcd backgrounds . both the atlas and cms experiments are pursuing studies relying on such observables in various new physics searches  @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite , and ref .",
    "@xcite for an earlier search by the cdf collaboration ) .",
    "boosted jets originating from electroweak gauge bosons  @xcite , top quarks  @xcite , higgs bosons  @xcite , and even new physics particles  @xcite are all of interest as targets of searches by the tevatron and the lhc experiments .",
    "it is therefore important to be able to distinguish them from qcd jets .",
    "recent reviews on substructure techniques , experimental status and new physics searches include refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "one way to characterize jet substructure is to consider observables which are functions of the energy flow within the jet , namely the energy distribution as measured by the detector ( see ref .  @xcite for a recent systematic classification ) . in this work",
    "we consider the hadronic collision @xmath0 where @xmath1 are the initial hadrons , and @xmath2 is a jet with momentum given by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , with size @xmath5 determined by the jet algorithm , and characterized by an energy - flow observable @xmath6 such as the jet mass @xmath7 .",
    "note that @xmath6 can stand for multiple energy - flow observables .",
    "we focus on narrow , highly - boosted jets , and consider the inclusive differential qcd cross section for this process , @xmath8 such cross sections are usually computed using parton - shower codes , which offer much less insight into results than analytic computations .",
    "they also require significant computational resources .    in this article",
    "we follow a different approach , based on the collinear factorization properties of amplitudes in perturbative , massless qcd .",
    "factorization allows us to focus on a single jet , ignoring to leading order the rest of process , and to compute the differential jet substructure distribution semi - analytically . in some limiting cases",
    ", we can compute the distribution completely analytically . as we demonstrate below",
    ", this method becomes useful when analyzing jets with sufficiently high @xmath3 ( @xmath9 tev ) , a window recently opened at the lhc ( see for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "there are various ways to define jet shapes . in the context of new - physics searches ,",
    "a particularly useful way to characterize jet shape and substructure observables is by the first non - trivial order at which they appear in fixed - order perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "consider , for instance , higgs boson searches : at leading order the higgs boson decays to two partons with large invariant mass .",
    "the relevant non - trivial substructure observables must distinguish two - prong jets from the broad spectrum of all jets .",
    "given a higgs - boson mass and @xmath3 , its decay kinematics are fully determined by one additional continuous variable , such as the ratio between the two decay - product momenta  @xcite or the opening angle between them  @xcite .",
    "the first non - trivial qcd background arises from corrections in which the jet is made up of two partons .",
    "if the higgs boson recoils against a jet , this background first arises at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in two - jet production , when @xmath10 processes are taken into account .",
    "this contribution is of @xmath11 in fixed - order perturbation theory .    in this example , the signal distribution at fixed @xmath3 is fully characterized by the jet mass and jet angularity  @xcite .",
    "we may think of these two quantities as replacing partonic ( and therefore unphysical ) parameters with physical infrared- and collinear- ( irc ) safe jet - shape observables  @xcite .",
    "when working to leading order ( lo ) in the jet mass , the angularity distribution is the only independent jet - shape observable that can separate the signal from the background .",
    "the corresponding lo distribution , given a mass cut , can be computed analytically both for the signal and background  @xcite , using the collinear approximation , which is adequate for narrow massive jets .",
    "the difference between the signal and background distributions turns out to be modest , because both the qcd and higgs - boson angularity distributions are monotonically decreasing functions between identical limiting values of the angularity variable .",
    "the same result obtains when considering the ratio of momenta or other kinematical variables , because they are all fully correlated with the angularity distribution .",
    "the similarity of the bounds on both the signal and background does yield a sharp prediction of this apparently naive picture .",
    "this prediction was qualitatively verified experimentally in the cdf collaboration s study  @xcite of high-@xmath3 massive jets .",
    "the next example of interest involves studies of high-@xmath3 top quarks . at leading order",
    ", each top quark decays to three partons ; in the decay , each parton pair typically has a large invariant mass .",
    "the same configuration is also relevant to studies of new physics  @xcite , for example of gluino decay in @xmath5-parity violating scenarios  @xcite . a useful jet - shape observable in such a study is the planar flow  @xcite .",
    "if we focus on studying one top quark out of the produced pair , the leading qcd background is two - jet production where we constrain one of the jets to have a significant planar flow .",
    "this background first arises at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) in two - jet production , when @xmath12 processes are taken into account .",
    "the contribution is of @xmath13 in fixed - order perturbation theory .",
    "while the planar - flow distribution of a top - quark jet at leading order can be computed straightforwardly from its known matrix element , the planar - flow distribution of the qcd background has not yet been computed for narrow massive jets .",
    "the corresponding distribution was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite with a rather limited sample size due to the limited statistics of massive boosted jets at the tevatron .",
    "lhc experiments have collected a much larger number of massive jets , which should allow a more precise measurement of the planar - flow distribution .",
    "our main purpose in this article is to compute the planar - flow distribution of narrow massive jets to leading order in qcd .",
    "we use the collinear approximation , in which we approximate the matrix element for such jets by @xmath14 collinear splitting functions .",
    "motivated by boosted - top studies , we take the jet mass to be roughly the top - quark mass . our approximation is relevant when the jet @xmath3 is substantially larger than the jet mass ; we take the @xmath3 to be @xmath15 .",
    "our computation assumes a jet algorithm that produces approximately circular jets with radius @xmath5 in the pseudorapidity ",
    "azimuthal  angle plane , but is otherwise general .",
    "the use of the collinear approximation also requires that the jet radius not be too large ; we take @xmath16 . in parton - shower simulations to which we compare , we use the anti-@xmath17 algorithm , with the same jet size .",
    "as already mentioned , this year s @xmath18-resonance searches are already exploring this range of parameter space .",
    "jet shape observables can be viewed as moments of the energy distribution within a jet  @xcite .",
    "they are highly susceptible to contamination from pile - up and other sources of soft radiation , especially for larger cone sizes  @xcite .",
    "such contamination is a major concern at present , with more than 20 interactions on average at each lhc bunch crossing .",
    "this number is expected to grow even larger in future runs .",
    "various techniques  @xcite allow one to estimate and subtract pile - up contributions",
    ". approaches in which jet - substructure analyses and searches are done in a way which is inherently less susceptible to such contamination would offer desirable alternatives to contamination subtraction .    two main classes of alternative approaches have emerged : ` filtering '  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) and ` template overlap '  @xcite . in the former ,",
    "a measured jet is declustered and its soft components are removed .",
    "this leaves only its hard components to be reclustered into the ` filtered ' reclustered jet . in the second approach",
    "measured jets are not manipulated , and are instead compared to a set of templates built according to a chosen ( computed ) fixed - order distribution of signal jets .",
    "the comparison makes use of an ` overlap function ' which evaluates the degree of overlap between each measured jet and the set of templates .",
    "the reader will find a discussion of jet - substructure observables and experimental applications in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "for both alternative approaches , it would be useful to study distributions of the core ( hard ) component of jets .",
    "this is relatively straightforward for the signals , but much more challenging for the qcd background .",
    "the semi - analytic calculations we pursue here are a first step in this direction , as our results provide a semi - analytic understanding of the kinematical distributions of the hard component of massive jets with non - trivial three - body kinematics . for this purpose",
    "we also compare the result of our full @xmath19 calculation with a similar calculation employing an iterated @xmath20 collinear splitting function in the approximation to the matrix element .",
    "we also discuss how various scale choices affect our result .",
    "finally , we compare our results with parton - shower results , both with and without matching to tree - level matrix elements .",
    "we cross - check our calculations with a simple analytic expression for the planar - flow distribution in the small - planar - flow limit .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sections",
    "[ planarflowsection ] and [ narrowjetssection ] , we define the planar - flow observable , introduce narrow jets and discuss various aspects of calculations of the jet function . in",
    ", we relate the jet functions of narrow jets to collinear splitting functions for two - body jets . as an illustrative example we compute the leading - order jet function for the mass distribution using splitting functions . in",
    "we prove that spin correlations in the splitting function factorize in all cases that are of interest in this article . in we use these methods to compute the leading - order combined mass and planar - flow jet function of three - body jets . for small values of the planar flow",
    "we obtain an analytic result below , while at large planar flow we rely on numerical integration .",
    "we also compare the jet function to one computed using an iterated @xmath20 approximation , discuss the behavior of the jet function at large planar flow , and discuss the sensitivity to scale choices . in",
    ", we compare the semi - analytic jet function to parton - shower calculations with and without matching to fixed - order matrix elements .",
    "we also discuss hadronization corrections , and corrections from terms in matrix elements beyond the collinear approximation .",
    "we present our conclusions in .",
    "six appendices furnish a variety of technical details .",
    "# 1p_,#1 # 1p_,#1 we are interested in two energy flow observables  the jet mass and planar flow .",
    "the jet mass squared is , @xmath21 where @xmath22 refers here to any parton ( or hadron or tower or topocluster in a more realistic experimental context ) inside the jet . for a hadronic collider we may define the planar flow as follows . define first a @xmath23 momentum shape tensor , @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the pseudorapidity and azimuthal - angle difference of each jet constituent from the jet axis .",
    "we take all constituents to be massless .",
    "this form is manifestly boost - invariant for boosts along the beam axis .",
    "the planar flow is then defined by @xmath26 one can easily verify that @xmath27 , and that it vanishes for two - body jets , receiving its leading contribution from three - body jets .",
    "is proportional to the jet mass  @xcite , the planar flow is only well defined for massive jets . ]",
    "the latter property means that the planar flow is potentially useful for distinguishing the qcd background from top jets .",
    "the value @xmath28 arises when the partons lie on a line in the detector plane . in particular",
    ", it will vanish for three - body jets when a parton becomes soft , or when two partons become collinear .",
    "three - parton configurations that are symmetric about the jet axis have @xmath29 .",
    "configurations with @xmath30 partons symmetric under rotations by @xmath31 radians around the jet axis also have @xmath32 .    for the sake of convenience , in the theoretical calculations that follow we will focus on central jets ( that is , with very small pseudorapidity ) . for such jets we can work in terms of the angles @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( being the polar coordinates around the jet axis ) , set @xmath35 , and exchange @xmath3 for @xmath36 ( the overall jet momentum ) . for narrow , central jets , we can rewrite the momentum - inertia tensor as follows , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the @xmath39th component of the transverse momentum of constituent @xmath22 with respect to the jet axis .    as we review in sect .",
    "[ sec : jm ] , the leading - log behavior of the jet function for the jet mass is given by @xmath40 where in this case @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and the jet radius @xmath43 . in this article",
    "we compute the mass and planar - flow jet function at leading order in @xmath44 , for narrow qcd jets . in the limit of small @xmath45",
    "we will obtain an analytic result for the leading - log behavior of the jet function . for small @xmath46",
    "it is given by the expression @xmath47    away from the limit of small planar flow , we will compute the planar - flow jet function semi - analytically , using numerical integration to obtain the final result .",
    "we will show that there is a physically interesting regime of parameters , with the jet mass near the top - quark mass and with @xmath48 , in which our result has rough agreement with the parton - shower simulations .",
    "( as shown below , the parton - shower results of different tools do not fully agree with each other , which however is not the focus of this study . )",
    "we expect our results to be useful for understanding how to refine methods to distinguish highly - boosted top jets from the qcd background at the lhc .",
    "the planar - flow distribution was measured by cdf  @xcite and atlas  @xcite , but with large statistical uncertainties , and using too large a cone size and too big a mass - to - momentum ratio to be compared with our results . at the lhc ,",
    "accurate measurements of planar - flow distributions are difficult due to pile - up effects ; but we may expect them to improve significantly over time . in principle",
    "one can ` refine ' jets in a controlled manner ( by applying filtering ; by using the template overlap method and then looking at the parton distribution of the peak templates ; by looking at events with a small number of vertices ; or by using other methods for pileup subtraction ) , and thereby isolate the hard part of the measured jet in order to compare with theoretical predictions even in the presence of incoherent soft radiation .",
    "let us consider jets at the parton level .",
    "if we take a jet to be narrow ( @xmath49 ) , the partons will be approximately collinear .",
    "as we review in the next section , when massless partons become collinear the qcd cross section factorizes partially , and we can write ( schematically for now ) , @xmath50 in the cross section on the right - hand side , the partons making up the jet are replaced by a parent parton of type @xmath51 , which can be either a gluon or one of the massless quarks .",
    "the jet substructure is encoded in the jet function @xmath52 , which has a simple physical interpretation : it is the probability distribution for the parent parton of type @xmath51 to evolve into a jet of size @xmath5 that has @xmath53 . accordingly , its integral is normalized to unity , @xmath54 . throughout our study",
    "we will be agnostic about the specific jet algorithm used in the analysis , and will assume only that it produces approximately circular jets with radius @xmath5 in the @xmath4@xmath34 plane .",
    "as we review in the next section , at fixed order in @xmath44 the jet function can be computed from splitting functions  @xcite , universal functions that govern the behavior of the squared matrix element in the collinear limit . in this limit , the squared matrix element factors into a product of a splitting function and a squared matrix element with lower multiplicity . in general , the factorization is not complete , due to the dependence of the splitting functions on the spin of the parent parton .",
    "we will show , however , that for all energy - flow observables the spin dependence does factorize .",
    "the fixed - order splitting function is singular in the limit where partons become soft or collinear . in eq .",
    "this singularity appears as a divergence of the jet function in the infrared limit of the observable @xmath6 ( for example taking @xmath55 in a two - body jet ) .",
    "resumming higher - order ( perturbative ) corrections cures the divergence , and replaces it with a peak at a finite value of @xmath6 ( for reviews see for example refs .",
    "a fixed - order calculation is accordingly unreliable when we get close to the infrared limit .",
    "this problem can be avoided by considering only values of the observable @xmath6 that are far away from the infrared limit , compared with the peak position in its distribution . in particular",
    ", we will always take the jet mass to be ` large enough ' in this sense .",
    "the peak in the jet - mass distribution , @xmath56 , is roughly near its average at @xmath57  @xcite , and we will take our jet mass to be much larger , @xmath58 , where we expect the fixed - order perturbative calculation to be reliable .    beyond higher - order perturbative corrections requiring resummation , there are also non - perturbative corrections ( in the form of hadronization ) , which become important in the infrared and tend to smear the jet function . if some of the fixed - order partons have transverse momentum relative to the jet that is small compared to the characteristic transverse momentum of the smearing effect , the final jet function will be dominated by the latter effects .",
    "keeping the observable @xmath6 away from its infrared limit avoids this problem as well . on the other hand , in order for the collinear approximation to hold , we can not stray too far from the infrared limit .",
    "finally , in order for the approximated distribution ( in the collinear limit and at fixed order in @xmath44 ) to be valid , we should not get too close to kinematic boundaries .    for our approximation to be reliable ,",
    "we need a range of values for @xmath6 that obeys these constraints . applying the constraints to the jet - mass observable , and requiring that we have a non - empty range of validity for the approximation , necessitates considering jets with sufficiently high @xmath3 .",
    "we therefore consider only highly - boosted jets . for a general observable ,",
    "the existence of such a range of validity is less clear .",
    "we will show later that to reasonable accuracy , a non - trivial range of validity does indeed exist for the mass and planar - flow jet functions with collision parameters typical of the lhc .",
    "in this section we compute the jet - mass distribution for massless qcd in the collinear limit using the splitting function @xcite , for both quark and gluon jets .",
    "consider again the hadronic collision , @xmath59 where @xmath1 are the initial hadrons with momenta @xmath60 , and @xmath2 is a jet of cone size @xmath5 and given @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the jet is further characterized by an energy - flow observable @xmath6 . for simplicity ,",
    "in this section we will take @xmath6 to be the jet mass squared , @xmath61 ; in the next section we will consider also the planar flow .",
    "the factorized cross section is given by , @xmath62 where @xmath63 are the parton distribution functions .",
    "for narrow jets @xmath64 further factorizes at leading order into a jet function , times a cross section in which the jet is replaced by a single parent parton , @xmath65 the sum is over the type @xmath51 of the parent parton , which can be a gluon or a quark with a specific flavor .",
    "the relation is due to the factorization of the qcd matrix element in the limit where two or more partons become collinear .",
    "the universal function in the factorization is proportional to the splitting function .",
    "we therefore seek to express the jet function in terms of the splitting function .",
    "let us first consider the case where the parent parton is a quark .",
    "this case is simpler because the quark splitting function does not depend on the helicity of the parent parton . here",
    "the cross section factorizes completely in the collinear limit .",
    "consider the matrix element for the scattering of two into @xmath30 massless qcd partons , @xmath66 here @xmath67 denote parton momenta ; the @xmath68 , parton types ; the @xmath69 , their colors ; and the @xmath70 , their helicities .",
    "outgoing particles are indexed by @xmath71 , and incoming particles by @xmath72 .",
    "define the abbreviation @xmath73 for the squared matrix element summed over color and helicities ( averaged in the case of incoming particles  we will leave this distinction implicit from now on ) .",
    "consider the limit in which two outgoing partons , say @xmath74 and @xmath75 , become collinear .",
    "the leading contribution to @xmath76 in this limit is from diagrams in which the two outgoing partons originate from a single parent parton with momentum @xmath77 , and with a type @xmath51 that is uniquely determined by the splitting process @xmath78 . in the collinear limit",
    "the parent goes on shell , leading to a @xmath79 singularity .",
    "when the parent is a quark , the squared matrix element factorizes as we approach the limit , @xmath80 where @xmath81 , and @xmath82 is the spin - averaged splitting function @xcite , given in appendix  [ sp12-func ] . in the squared matrix element on the right - hand side ,",
    "the two collinear partons are replaced by their parent parton . for a gluon jet ,",
    "the splitting function depends on the helicity of the parent parton , and the factorization is not as simple as in eq .  ; we consider this case in the next subsection .",
    "the fixed - order differential cross section is given in terms of the squared matrix element  @xcite , @xmath83    |{\\ensuremath{\\mathcal{m}}}_{2 \\to n}|^2 \\ ;    \\delta^4(p_{\\mathrm{f , tot } } - p_{\\mathrm{i , tot } } ) { \\,.}\\label{dsigma}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using eq .   and making a change of variables @xmath84 it is easy to see that near the collinear limit , @xmath85 where @xmath86 is defined in terms of the matrix element on the right - hand side of eq .  .",
    "comparing with the postulated relation @xmath87 , we may now write down the jet function , @xmath88 here , @xmath89 are the angles of the momenta @xmath90 with respect to the jet axis @xmath91 , and the step functions @xmath92 are put in by hand to enforce , with any jet algorithm that produces approximately circular jets  @xcite . ] a cone of size @xmath5 .",
    "the sum is over allowed splitting processes , and the symmetry factor @xmath93 corrects the over - counting of identical parton configurations in eq .  : it is @xmath94 when @xmath95 , and @xmath96 when they are different .",
    "we stress that eq .",
    "is valid only to leading order in @xmath44 at the partonic level .",
    "the full jet function receives corrections at higher orders in perturbation theory ( some of which require resummation ) as well as from non - perturbative effects .",
    "it is now a straightforward exercise to substitute the quark splitting function into eq .   and compute the jet function , assuming @xmath97 .",
    "the quark splitting function is  @xcite @xmath98 where @xmath99 , and @xmath100 is the emitted gluon s energy fraction , in our approximation . using eq .   and solving the integral in eq .",
    ", we find the leading - log expression for the quark jet function , valid for @xmath101 @xmath102 this result was derived in ref .",
    "@xcite using slightly different terminology but a similar limit .",
    "as we explain in detail in appendix  [ sec : splitmaspf ] , the form of  eq .   can be alternatively obtained by rewriting the mass as a function of the emission angle and @xmath103 , and replacing @xmath103 with @xmath7 as the integration variable .",
    "this makes explicit the overall @xmath104 dependence , and the integration over the angle within the allowed kinematical boundaries further leads to the log in  eq .  .    when @xmath55 , the jet function diverges .",
    "this is an infrared divergence , resulting from partons becoming soft and collinear . in this",
    "limit higher order contributions in @xmath105 become important , and after resumming them the singularity is exponentially suppressed .",
    "thus , the full jet function vanishes in the massless jet limit ( see for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) ; and because it decays at large mass , a peak of the jet mass is expected to arise at low jet mass .",
    "the result in eq .",
    "is therefore only reliable when @xmath106 . the divergence in eq .   also renders the distribution non - normalizable .",
    "nevertheless , in the regime where our approximation is valid we expect our result to match the full jet function including its overall normalization .",
    "in other words , in this regime it gives the ( leading ) probability distribution of a quark to evolve into a radius-@xmath5 jet with mass @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "this behavior was verified experimentally , at least qualitatively , in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we now turn to the case of gluon jets . unlike the quark case ,",
    "the gluon splitting functions have a non - trivial dependence on the helicity of the parent parton . as a result",
    ", the collinear factorization of the squared matrix element is incomplete . for the computation of the jet - mass distribution the incomplete factorization does not alter the leading - log result : in this case , the spin correlations are nonsingular .",
    "however , we would like to go beyond this and establish a general result that will be useful in the rest of our study .",
    "the spin correlations always factorize when one considers distributions of energy - flow observables defined for a single jet .",
    "we will prove this for the @xmath20 splitting function , and the proof can be easily generalized to the @xmath19 splitting function .    in the presence of spin correlations ,",
    "the collinear factorization of the squared matrix element is no longer correct , and instead we have @xcite , @xmath107 where now @xmath108 is the helicity - dependent splitting function , and @xmath109 is defined in terms of the matrix element @xmath110 by @xmath111^\\dagger { \\,.}\\label{t}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath109 is essentially the matrix element @xmath110 , squared , except that there is no sum over the helicity of the jet s parent parton .",
    "the differential cross section no longer factorizes as it did in eq .  .",
    "however , in the jet - function definition the phase - space integral includes an azimuthal integral around the jet axis .",
    "for example , changing the integration variables in eq .   to polar coordinates",
    "@xmath112 ( relative to the jet axis @xmath91 ) , the integration over rotations around the jet axis is described by the variable @xmath113 , keeping @xmath114 fixed . therefore , for any observable that is invariant under rotations around the jet axis the integral picks out the part of the splitting function that is invariant under such rotations , which is precisely the spin - averaged splitting function .",
    "this includes all energy - flow observables defined in terms of a single jet , because for such observables there is no preferred direction in the detector plane that can break the rotational symmetry .",
    "we may therefore replace @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the spin - averaged splitting function .",
    "noting that @xmath117 , the rest of the computation follows through as in the previous section , and we conclude that the jet function for gluon jets is given by eq .  , just as for quark jets .",
    "we conclude this section by computing the leading - log part of the gluon jet - mass function . for @xmath118 and @xmath119 ,",
    "the leading contribution comes only from the @xmath120 splitting function , @xmath121 { \\,,}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath122 , and we find @xmath123 again in agreement with ref .  @xcite .",
    "in this section we compute the planar - flow jet function @xmath124 , which receives its leading contribution from three - body jets .",
    "this jet function factorizes from the rest of the cross section when we take the `` triple '' collinear limit , in which three partons become collinear simultaneously .",
    "the limit is analogous to the ( `` double '' ) collinear limit that we studied in the last section .",
    "we consider @xmath125 scattering with matrix element @xmath126 , where three outgoing massless partons with four - momenta @xmath127 are collinear .",
    "the parton energies are denoted by @xmath128 .",
    "the jet made out of these three partons has energy @xmath129 , momentum @xmath36 and mass @xmath7 .",
    "finally , we define the energy fractions @xmath130 , and also , @xmath131    in the collinear limit , the squared matrix element of the scattering process factorizes as follows  @xcite , @xmath132 here , @xmath133 is the one - to - three splitting function @xcite for the splitting @xmath134 ; the type @xmath51 of the parent parton is determined by flavor conservation .",
    "the splitting function depends on the outgoing momenta and each parton @xmath68 is associated to a momentum @xmath67 . as in sect .",

    "for instance , massive jets with large @xmath45 arise in models with heavy resonances decaying dominantly to top quarks or in supersymmetric models with @xmath5-parity - violating gluinos . in this paper",

    "we obtained a semi - analytic form for this distribution , independent of the underlying hard process giving rise to the jet .",

    "we have also derived the leading - log behavior of the jet functions analytically .",

    "the divergence of the planar - flow distribution should be regulated by resummation of leading logarithms to all orders in perturbation theory . to the best of our knowledge , this resummation has not been computed , and the resulting resummed distribution would be of interest .    we have compared our semi - analytic jet function to parton - shower predictions using various event generators .",
    "the broad features are in agreement in the region of validity of our fixed - order calculation , as the parton - shower results interpolate between the predicted quark and gluon jet functions .",

    "in contrast , the results from madgraph with pythia showering are above our results with matching ( using mlm ) , but below our predictions without matching . in the region of validity ,",
    "hadronization effects increase the value of the jet function modestly without altering its shape .",
    "we note that the results of these two parton - shower codes do not agree with each other , either with or without matching .",
    "the differences between them , even with matching , are comparable to the differences from our semi - analytic results , and the differences are greater without matching .",
    "this variation suggests that some caution should be exercised when comparing these results with experimental data , and that a data - driven approach to jet substructure should be explored as well .",
    "the qualitative agreement of the semi - analytic results with the parton - shower calculations does however suggest that futher refinement of the fixed - order prediction , for example by carrying out a next - to - leading order calculation , would be valuable .",

    "planar flow is one of several three - prong substructure variables that can play a role in discriminating highly - boosted jets arising from three - body decays of heavy particles from qcd backgrounds .",
    "it tends to be sensitive to soft radiation near the edge of the jet , which also makes it sensitive to pile - up .",
    "this motivates the use of jet filtering or template overlaps , where the hard substructure in a jet can be enhanced in a controlled manner .",
