    "studies of both exclusive and inclusive semileptonic decays of the @xmath5 meson can be used to extract the magnitude of the ckm matrix element @xmath3 .",
    "both methods require some input from theory .",
    "because the exclusive modes suffer from large form - factor uncertainties , the determination from inclusive @xmath0 decays are theoretically favored .",
    "the overall relative uncertainty on @xmath3 measurements is currently about 15% @xcite , and there is hope for a significant reduction of the dominant theoretical errors in the future .",
    "the main problem in the computation of the relevant quantities is that it requires a framework which includes a systematic treatment of both perturbative corrections ( including sudakov resummation ) and non - perturbative effects ( shape function ) .",
    "much progress in qcd - factorization of inclusive @xmath5 decays has been made in the past several months @xcite , and the aforementioned problem is now understood using a sophisticated effective field theory machinery .",
    "the main ingredients are soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite , heavy - quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite , and renormalization - group ( rg ) evolution of bilocal operators on the light cone @xcite .",
    "let us begin by discussing the kinematic setup used in the description of a typical @xmath0 event .",
    "the momentum of the hadronic @xmath6 system is denoted by @xmath7 , and we work in the rest frame of the @xmath5 meson .",
    "it is useful to describe the hadronic phase space in the variables @xmath8 and @xmath9 , in which it takes the simple form of a triangle ( neglecting the pion mass ) @xmath10 the phase space is depicted in figure  [ fig : phasespace ] .",
    "the use of the light - cone variables @xmath2 and @xmath11 makes it easy to interpret an event ( a point ) in this picture : the region of low recoil is along the diagonal , while an event with a maximally recoiling @xmath6 is located on the right .",
    "events with final - state hadronic invariant masses larger than @xmath12 are located in the light - gray wedge in the upper part of the figure , since @xmath13 .",
    "the dark - gray region underneath is free of the @xmath4 background , which is about 60 times larger than the @xmath14 signal .",
    "there are many possibilities to eliminate the background by cutting on kinematic variables .",
    "let us briefly mention a few of them .",
    "clearly a cut on @xmath15 is the `` ideal '' separator , denoted as a solid line in figure  [ fig : phasespace ] .",
    "the dashed horizontal line is located at @xmath16 , which marks an alternative way of eliminating charm events .",
    "a cut on the charged - lepton energy @xmath17 samples the same hadronic phase space as a cut on @xmath18 .",
    "however , it contains far fewer events .",
    "finally , a cut on the dilepton momentum squares @xmath19 leads to the area underneath the dotted line .",
    "the phase space is most densely populated in the `` shape - function region '' of large @xmath20 and small @xmath21 . in order to determine @xmath3 from this inclusive decay mode",
    "it is necessary to know what fractions of events survive the various experimental cuts . in this talk",
    "we report on progress to answer this question .",
    "in addition , we advertise cutting on @xmath2 as an efficient method for future @xmath3 determinations . to this end",
    "we study the advantages and disadvantages of this method over comparable ones , in particular the `` ideal separator '' @xmath22 .",
    "recently , a systematic framework has been developed @xcite that enables us to compute the differential decay rates in the shape - function region .",
    "a series of matching calculations qcd @xmath23 scet @xmath23 hqet is necessary to disentangle physics at the three different energy scales @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 . the general methodology is schematically visualized in figure  [ fig : factmeth ] .",
    "the idea is as follows : under the assumption of quark - hadron duality , the inclusive decay rate can be calculated in qcd using the optical theorem .",
    "the intermediate line denotes the energetic @xmath27-quark propagator . at a hard scale @xmath28 ,",
    "the amplitude is matched onto scet , which correctly describes the infra - red degrees of freedom below this scale .",
    "physics effects from scales above @xmath29 are contained in a hard coefficient function @xmath30 .",
    "since the @xmath27-quark momentum is parametrically off - shell by an amount of @xmath31 , the corresponding propagator can be integrated out at an intermediate matching scale @xmath32 , leading to a perturbatively calculable jet function @xmath33 and a low - energy description in hqet .",
    "the matrix element of the resulting leading power operator defines the hadronic shape function , which can not be computed using analytic techniques .",
    "large ( sudakov ) logarithms are resummed when evolving the hard function from the hard scale @xmath29 down to the intermediate scale @xmath34 .",
    "finally the decay amplitude is expressed as a convolution integral of perturbatively calculable functions and the shape function renormalized at @xmath34 .",
    "event fractions and spectra are derived by performing the necessary phase - space integrations , _ before _ integrating over the shape function . in this way , the results are model independent and once again given as convolution integrals over the shape function .",
    "the shape function is a non - perturbative structure function that encodes the fermi motion of the heavy quark inside the @xmath5 meson @xcite .",
    "although the functional form of it can not be derived using analytical techniques , it is nevertheless possible to study other properties of it using perturbation theory .",
    "in particular , the dependence on the renormalization scale @xmath35 can be reliably computed as long as @xmath35 is much larger than @xmath26 . at leading order in renormalization - group improved perturbation theory it is given by the simple formula ( for @xmath36 ) @xmath37 where @xmath38 , and the exponent @xmath39 vanishes in the limit @xmath40 .",
    "( the hatted notation denotes that the shape function is defined in a scheme - independent way and has support for @xmath41 . for details , see ref .",
    "@xcite . ) as a consequence of ( [ wow ] ) , radiative corrections build up a tail that vanishes slower than @xmath42 for @xmath43 .",
    "this means that moments of the shape function ( including its norm ) are uv - divergent .",
    "this is , however , not an obstacle in practice , where the shape function is only needed over a finite interval .",
    "it is then natural to define moments accordingly over a finite integration domain , by means of a cutoff .",
    "expanding them in a local ope allows us to extract information about the shape function from the measurement of hqet parameters such as @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the shape - function mass scheme @xcite is convenient for such calculations and free of renormalon ambiguities .",
    "we stress , however , that information of @xmath44 and @xmath45 in _ any _ low - scale subtracted mass scheme is useful , since there exist perturbatively calculable relations between these mass definitions .",
    "a somewhat surprising observation is made by inspecting the behaviour of the moments under variation of the cutoff .",
    "it turns out that their values _",
    "decrease _ for larger cutoffs .",
    "it follows that the tail of the shape function must be negative !",
    "in fact , it is possible to derive the explicit form of the shape function itself for large values of @xmath46 .",
    "we find that the asymptotic tail is given in the @xmath47 scheme as @xcite @xmath48 and one has to drop the common interpretation of the renormalized shape function as a probability distribution .      in the region @xmath49 , where it is relevant for phenomenological applications ,",
    "the shape function can not be computed within perturbation theory . in the following",
    "we will use a simple model that is consistent with all analytic constraints mentioned above .",
    "the model is constructed in such a way that its first few moments are consistent with the experimental values @xmath50 and @xmath51 at a reference scale of @xmath52 in the shape - function scheme ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "below we will use nine different functions ( corresponding to the nine different pairs of values @xmath53 when varied within their errors ) to account for our ignorance of the functional form of the shape function .",
    "figure  [ fig : sfmodel ] is intended to give the reader an idea of such variations .",
    "we stress , however , that a hypothetical knowledge of the first few moments to arbitrary precision would not determine the functional form of the shape function .",
    "with the methodology outlined in section  [ sec : method ] we find the following expression for the fraction of events that survive a cut @xmath54 , i.  e.  that are located below a horizontal line in the phase - space picture in figure  [ fig : phasespace ] . at leading power in @xmath55 and",
    "at next - to - leading order in renormalization - group improved perturbation theory , it is given as a weighted integral over the shape function : @xmath56 large sudakov logarithms are resummed in the expression @xmath57 ( where @xmath58 for typical choices of @xmath59 ) , and the weight function @xmath60 is perturbatively calculable @xcite and starts as @xmath61 .",
    "when cutting on the hadronic invariant mass @xmath62 instead , the corresponding event fraction is given by @xmath63 the two terms in the above expression can be easily interpreted using the phase - space picture in figure  [ fig : phasespace ] . for an optimal cut @xmath64 the allowed region ( dark gray )",
    "splits into two distinct areas , separated by the dashed line .",
    "events below that line are included in the count by the first term in ( [ eq : fm ] ) .",
    "the second term counts events in the triangle - shaped region above the dashed line . to account for the tip of this triangle ( @xmath65 )",
    "is problematic in the aforementioned framework , because the assumption @xmath66 and the resulting power - expansion rules are no longer valid .",
    "however , only few events are located near the tip , which is reflected in the finding that the corresponding contribution to @xmath67 scales like @xmath68 ( assuming @xmath69 ) .",
    "therefore one obtains a well defined leading power expression by setting the upper limit of integration from @xmath70 to @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "it is unclear , however , how to treat power corrections to @xmath67 systematically in the future improvement of this result .",
    "qcd - factorization is a powerful tool because the non - perturbative structure functions entering the theoretical description are universal , process - independent quantities .",
    "the shape function needed in this discussion on @xmath0 decays is also the only leading - power structure function entering the calculation of the important @xmath72 decay rate .",
    "in fact , at leading power and leading order in @xmath73 , the shape function is identical to the photon spectrum .",
    "this implies that it is possible to construct relations between the photon spectrum and the event distribution functions in @xmath0 decays in which the shape function has been eliminated .",
    "an example of such a relation is @xcite @xmath74 the weight function @xmath75 is perturbatively calculable once our formalism has been applied to calculate the @xmath72 photon spectrum .",
    "note that a similar relation to the hadronic invariant mass distribution @xmath67 would be possible , but more complicated .",
    "because of the contribution from the triangle region , the photon spectrum would be needed over a larger window and beyond the region where it is experimentally known with acceptable precision .",
    "we use the nine model shape functions discussed in section  [ sec : modelsf ] to predict the event fractions @xmath76 and @xmath67 and demonstrate their sensitivity to the shape function . in principle , one also has to vary the functional form of the shape function without violating the constraints for its first few moments . in the end",
    "we find , however , that such variations are already covered in the sample of the nine models @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : pplusandmx ] our results are depicted as gray bands .",
    "each of the bands represents the results using shape function models that correspond to a fixed value of @xmath44 , while the numerical value of @xmath45 is varied within its error bars .",
    "we draw three bands for three values of @xmath44 : 0.56 gev , 0.63 gev , and 0.70 gev , in accordance with our discussion in section  [ sec : modelsf ] . the calculations are valid for @xmath77 and @xmath78 of order @xmath26 .",
    "if these values are too small , i.  e.  parametrically of order @xmath79 , the assumption of quark - hadron duality is no longer justified . if , on the other hand , @xmath80 are larger than about 0.8 gev , the collinear expansion used in the calculation breaks down .",
    ".[tab : ppandmx]shape - function uncertainties for typical cuts on the hadronic variables @xmath22 and @xmath2 . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     numerical predictions using shape - function models are visualized in figure  [ fig : el ] and summarized in table  [ tab : el ] . for orientation , the beginning of the charm background at @xmath81",
    "is marked with an arrow in the figure .",
    "evidently , the relative shape - function uncertainties are large , and do not show a `` focusing effect '' as in the case of @xmath2 or @xmath22 cuts . because of the large shape - function sensitivity and the overall small efficiency , the extraction of @xmath3 from the charged - lepton energy endpoint region is theoretically disfavored .",
    "an interesting observation can be made when comparing the third column in table  [ tab : el ] with our results ( blnp = bosch , lange , neubert , paz @xcite ) in the fourth column .",
    "the former are predictions using the familiar defazio / neubert model ( dfn ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , where a simple replacement rule is used to implement the shape function into the results of parton - level calculations .",
    "the crucial difference is that our framework allows for a clean separation of short- and long - distance physics effects . in order to demonstrate this , consider the one - loop order result of the triple differential decay rate @xcite .",
    "the leading logarithm comes with a coefficient of @xmath82 . in the framework of factorization ,",
    "this coefficient will split into @xmath83 . while the leading logarithm of the jet function comes with the coefficient @xmath84 , the @xmath85",
    "will be absorbed in the `` partonic '' shape function .",
    "the simple replacement rule of the dfn model does not capture this effect correctly .",
    "in addition to this important observation , the factorization framework allows for a systematic sudakov resummation , which was not performed in the work of @xcite .",
    "the numerical impact of these improvements over our previous understanding is that the predictions for the event fractions in the charged - lepton energy endpoint have increased quite noticeably .",
    "this implies in turn that experimental @xmath3 determinations from the charged - lepton energy endpoint region might need to be corrected to lower values .",
    "in general , our analysis for @xmath0 decay spectra in the shape - function region suggests that more events than previously anticipated are located in the shape - function region",
    ". it will be most interesting to study how power corrections will affect this conclusion .",
    "the @xmath2 spectrum has a considerable advantage over the hadronic - mass spectrum when considering the charm background .",
    "it is straight - forward to visualize the area in phase space that is populated by inclusive @xmath4 decays .",
    "the ope prediction uses quark - hadron duality and the fact that @xmath86 in the parton picture .",
    "here , @xmath87 are the light - cone components of the parton momentum , and @xmath88 is the charm quark mass .",
    "the dotted line in figure  [ fig : charmbg ] marks the threshold @xmath89 . at tree - level , all events are located on that line .",
    "radiative corrections smear the event distribution into the area above it . in this sense ,",
    "the tree - level scenario serves as an upper bound of the inclusive charm background .",
    "note that the dotted line touches the tip of the triangle , @xmath90 and extends to the right while always staying _ above _ the exclusive @xmath91 solid line .",
    "it follows that the variable @xmath2 is bound to be always greater than approximately 960 mev in the parton model .",
    "therefore an ideal cut on @xmath92 mev has the advantage of a comfortable `` buffer zone '' to the inclusive background .",
    "the gap between the charm - free area ( dark gray ) and the inclusive charm background ( above the dotted line ) is filled with exclusive final states such as @xmath91 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , etc .    in figure",
    "[ fig : pplusandmx ] the results for a tree - level calculation @xcite of the inclusive and exclusive event fractions are drawn as solid and short - dashed lines , respectively .",
    "note that the event fractions are normalized to unity ; however , the reader should keep in mind that the @xmath4 background is about 60 times larger than the @xmath14 signal .",
    "consider now what happens when the quantities @xmath80 approach the charm threshold near 660 mev .",
    "the charmed hadronic invariant mass spectrum receives step increments when the @xmath95 and @xmath96 phase space becomes available . at the same time",
    ", the inclusive rates start near 660 mev and reaches unity at 960 mev in the tree approximation .",
    "detector resolution effects smear the charm events into the region below 660 mev , and force us to move away from the ideal cut , which leads to enhanced shape - function uncertainties in the @xmath14 event fractions ( see table  [ tab : ppandmx ] ) .",
    "the scenario for the @xmath2 spectrum is different .",
    "the short - dashed line in the left part of figure  [ fig : pplusandmx ] also starts near 660 mev , but has a smooth onset .",
    "the same applies when the @xmath96 phase space becomes available , leading to a ( tiny ) kink in the line .",
    "however , up until this point , the charm background consists _",
    "exclusively _ of @xmath91 events , since the inclusive events start much later at 960 mev .",
    "the knowledge of the precise nature of the background ought to help experimentally to stay closer to the ideal cut , because it can be modeled with greater precision .",
    "we believe that this fact , together with the cleanliness of the theoretical description , make the @xmath2 method an excellent high - efficiency candidate for a determination of @xmath3 , and we urge the experimental community to perform a measurement of the @xmath2 spectrum .",
    "in this talk we have presented recent advances in the understanding of inclusive @xmath5 decays in the shape - function region . using effective field theory techniques , a systematic framework was developed , where a simple ope can not be used due to soft shape function effects .",
    "new results for event distributions of several important kinematic quantities , including the hadronic invariant mass and the charged - lepton energy , have been presented .",
    "we advertised a new method for the extraction of @xmath3 based on the @xmath2 spectrum .",
    "we stress , however , that this should not be understood as a discouragement of pursuing other methods , but rather as an encouragement to consider the @xmath2 method as a powerful alternative .",
    "the calculations have been performed in the heavy - quark limit and at next - to - leading order in rg - improved perturbation theory .",
    "our prediction for the fraction of events with the optimal cut @xmath97 is @xcite @xmath98 where the errors represent the sensitivity to the shape function , an estimate of @xmath99 contributions , and power corrections , respectively .",
    "each of these uncertainties can be reduced in the future within the general framework presented in @xcite and outlined in section  [ sec : method ] .",
    "much can be learned about the shape function from the @xmath100 photon spectrum , once the formalism has been applied .",
    "the calculation of @xmath99 corrections would be a major effort , but is feasible in the future .",
    "the important question of power corrections are currently investigated by several groups in the theory community .",
    "the ckm - matrix element @xmath3 can be extracted by comparing a measurement of the partial rate @xmath101 with a theoretical prediction for the product of the event fraction @xmath102 and the total inclusive @xmath103 rate .",
    "the resulting theoretical uncertainty on @xmath3 is @xmath104 where the last error comes from the uncertainty in the total rate @xcite . because of the large efficiency of the @xmath105 cut , weak annihilation effects @xcite have an influence on @xmath3 of less than 2% and",
    "can be safely neglected .",
