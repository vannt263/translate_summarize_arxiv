    "the only information about the sources left from the above limiting procedure is that the sources drive only positive frequencies in the fields , thus the condition for the sought solution is that it should contain only the positive frequency part with all harmonics being multiples of @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "the latter condition is equivalent to requiring that the solution for the fields goes to the classical vacuum at infinity in the euclidean time @xmath161 .",

    "[ ac ]    the operational procedure for calculating the amplitudes is therefore as follows .",

    "this parameter is in one - to - one correspondence with the integration constant @xmath83 , or the value of the dual function @xmath62 on the trajectory .",

    "furthermore , for a rational ratio @xmath41 the masses @xmath149 and @xmath150 are also in a rational proportion .",
    "thus if only the @xmath10 dependence of the fields were known , there would be an ambiguity , at least in some harmonics , in separation between the production of the @xmath31 bosons and the @xmath30 bosons .",

    "indeed , the amplitudes @xmath178 and @xmath179 considered here are the matrix elements of the field operators in eqs .",
    "( [ ap ] ) and ( [ ac ] ) .",
    "these matrix elements have the propagators of the final on - shell bosons amputated , but the propagator of the incoming virtual field is not amputated and remains included in the corresponding amplitude @xmath223 .",

    "@xmath220 the inverse propagator of the incoming @xmath30 is vanishing at threshold of four @xmath31 .",

    "this means that for the values of @xmath41 where the resonance could potentially occur , i.e. @xmath225 for even integer @xmath41 , it actually does not take place due to vanishing of the corresponding feynman scattering amplitude .",
    "in summary , in a class of supersymmetric models with the continuously degenerate family of bps domain walls ( with real trajectories ) an additional integral of motion is observed .",
    "the occurrence of this integral allowed us to find a generic solution from the family in quadratures , while for a specific ratio of the coupling constants the whole wall family is obtained in the closed form in terms of elementary functions .",
    "we then further utilize the result for deriving the multiparticle amplitudes at threshold in the minimal two - field wess - zumino model .",
    "the threshold amplitudes are calculated in a closed form for @xmath109 .",
    "in the course of the calculation we have found an unexpected cancellation of the tree graphs for the feynman amplitude of the process @xmath220 at the threshold , due to which cancellation the multiparticle threshold amplitudes are finite . we also conclude that the same cancellation takes place for the process @xmath225 at arbitrary even integer @xmath41 , except @xmath224 .",
    "the relation of this cancellation to additional integrals of motion is yet to be studied .",
    "it can be also noted that the nullification of the amplitudes is somewhat reminiscent of the general property of nullification@xmath226 for the on - shell processes @xmath227 at the threshold in scalar theories .",
    "interesting phenomena occur when the models at hand are dimensionally reduced to d=2 .",
    "the two - dimensional theories thus obtained have extended supersymmetry , @xmath63 .",
    "a continuous degeneracy of the soliton family ( persisting with all quantum corrections included ) reflecting the possibility of the continuous deformations of the solution profile can be seemingly interpreted in this case as the existence of decoupled  basic solitons \" .",
    "revealing these decoupled basic solitons in an explicit form and studying their properties is an obvious next problem to be dealt with in the given range of questions ."
