    "the bhlumi monte carlo ( mc ) program@xcite was developed as a precision tool for calculating the small - angle bhabha luminosity process at slc and lep , and with continued development , it will continue to be a valuable tool meeting the requirements of a next - generation linear @xmath1 collider , such as the proposed ilc .",
    "central to this program s success was an exact treatment of the phase space for @xmath2 photon bremsstrahlung .",
    "a yfs - exponentiation@xcite procedure allows all ir singularities to be canceled exactly between real and virtual emission processes to all orders .",
    "the leading soft photon effects are exponentiated , and ir - finite yfs residuals are then calculated exactly to the order required to reach the desired precision level .",
    "bhlumi attained a total error budget of 0.061% for lep1 parameters and 0.122% for lep2 parameters for a typical calorimetric detector scenario.@xcite to assure this precision level , it was necessary to calculate the most important unimplemented effect in bhlumi4.04 , which was the next to leading - log ( nll ) contribution to the two - photon radiative corrections .",
    "the double real photon and single real plus virtual photon corrections to the small - angle bhabha scattering process were calculated exactly in refs .",
    "@xcite when added to the known two - loop virtual correction@xcite , these results showed that the @xmath3 corrections enter at the 0.027% level for lep1 parameters and 0.04% level for lep2 parameters .",
    "here , @xmath4 is the `` large logarithm '' entering into a leading log expansion .    implementing these exact @xmath5 results in bhlumi would eliminate these contributions to the error budget .",
    "the only remaining unimplemented @xmath5 radiative corrections would then be up - down interference effects in which two virtual photons are exchanged between the @xmath6 and @xmath7 line , which are suppressed at small angles , and nominally enter at the level of 0.004% or less for angles below @xmath8.@xcite these contributions , represented by diagrams of the type shown in fig .  1 , could thus be safely neglected for slc and lep physics .",
    "-0.5 cm    for ilc physics , where the goal is to reach 0.01% in the small - angle bhabha luminosity process , it is desirable to carefully check the magnitude of the up - down interference terms , and to implement them if they turn out to be significant . a key ingredient in the comparison , the five - point box integral appearing in the second and fourth diagram in fig .  1",
    ", has recently been provided by the looptools 2.2 package.@xcite a number of other @xmath5 calculations which have appeared recently@xcite should also provide valuable insight into effects which may need to be implemented in the small - angle bhabha calculation to reach ilc precision specifications .",
    "fermion pair production plays a critical role in extracting precision electroweak physics from @xmath1 colliders .",
    "this process is calculated by another yfs - exponentiated mc program , the @xmath0mc.@xcite again , the photonic radiative corrections play an essential role in calculating the yfs residuals through order @xmath9 .",
    "these have been calculated exactly , including finite - mass corrections , for initial state and final state radiation.@xcite    using helicity spinor techniques,@xcite a concise and stable representation for the @xmath5 initial or final state radiation amplitude has been obtained , including finite - mass corrections . the matrix element for hard photon initial - state emission with one virtual photon may be expressed as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the tree - level matrix element for single hard photon emission , @xmath12 are scalar form factors and @xmath13 are spinor factors defined in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the single hard photon cross section is of particular interest in radiative return applications@xcite , where initial state radiation is used to reduce the effective beam energy , allowing a fixed energy machine to probe a range of energies .",
    "a mc program phokhara was developed to calculate radiative return at @xmath14 and @xmath15 factories.@xcite the same radiative corrections are relevant for a high - energy @xmath1 collider investigating physics around the @xmath16 peak , for example .",
    "it is therefore useful to compare the radiative corrections obtained for both the @xmath0mc and phokhara in detail .",
    "both calculations claim the same level of exactness , including the same diagrams as well as electron mass corrections relevant for collinear bremsstrahlung .    we have compared the virtual corrections to initial state hard - photon emission calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite ( kr ) for phokhara to those calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite ( jmwy ) for the @xmath0mc in the case of muon pair production .",
    "analytically , it was found that in the absence of mass corrections , both expressions agree to nll order ( @xmath3 in the integrated cross section).@xcite a compact expression for nll limit of the matrix element was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that the terms @xmath17 and @xmath18 in eqn .",
    "( [ vdef1 ] ) vanish to nll order , and the helicity - averaged nll limit of @xmath19 is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the `` large logarithm '' in the leading log expansion , @xmath22 measures the inner product of one of the incoming fermion momenta @xmath23 with the hard photon momentum @xmath24 , sp@xmath25 = li@xmath26 is the dilogarithm ( spence ) function , and @xmath27 is the ir - divergent virtual yfs form factor .    since the two results are known to agree with the nll limit calculated using eqn .",
    "( [ f0 ] ) , the nll limit is subtracted in each case , permitting the nnll contributions and collinear mass corrections to be investigated in the context of the @xmath0mc .",
    "2 shows the results of a @xmath0mc run calculating the nnll contribution to muon pair production at a cms energy of 500 gev for @xmath28 events , both with and without the mass corrections .",
    "the cross - section is integrated up to a radiated photon energy fraction of @xmath29 ( with @xmath30 ) using the yfs residual @xmath31 for one hard photon at @xmath5 , subtracting the nll contribution obtained using eqn .",
    "( [ f0 ] ) .",
    "the result is normalized with respect to the non - radiative born cross section for muon pair production .",
    "it is found that the maximum difference between the complete kr and jmwy results ( from the next - to - last bin ) is @xmath32 units of the born cross section .",
    "most of this apparently comes from differences in the treatment of the mass corrections .",
    "kr uses an expansion in @xmath33 , while jmwy uses a technique developed by berends _",
    "et al._@xcite for adding the mass corrections required in collinear limits to a calculation obtained using massless spinors . without mass corrections",
    "( comparing the massless points ) , the results agree to within a part per million . this agreement is better than noted previously@xcite due to improvements in the stability of the algorithms used .",
    "direct comparisons of the phokhara and @xmath0mc programs have also been conducted.@xcite    it is interesting to note that the size of the nnll part of the corrections implemented by jmwy never exceed @xmath34 up to @xmath35 , and reach @xmath36 in the last bin , where @xmath37 .",
    "this suggests that for most purposes , the considerably simpler nll result represented by eqn .",
    "( [ f0 ] ) will suffice .",
    "the drell - yan process plays a role at hadron colliders which is as basic as the bhabha scattering or pair production cross section at @xmath1 colliders .",
    "in fact , @xmath38 and @xmath16 production has been proposed as the luminosity process for the lhc.@xcite a fully exclusive calculation of the parton - level cross sections is needed at the @xmath39 level for upcoming lhc physics .",
    "these cross sections are currently known at the @xmath40 level , using nlo matrix elements .",
    "while nnlo results are available for the integrated cross section@xcite and rapidity distribution@xcite , a fully - exclusive nnlo cross section needed for a mc event generator is not yet available .",
    "moreover , electroweak radiative corrections will be required as well .",
    "reaching the desired lhc precision will require corrections of order @xmath41 and order @xmath42 , including mixed @xmath43 contributions .",
    "examples of the latter diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "( 7.5,6.5 ) ( 1.8,3.5)(a ) ( 0,3.25 ) ( 5.6,3.5)(b ) ( 0,0 ) ( 1.8,0.25)(c ) ( 3.75,3.25 ) ( 5.6,0.25)(d ) ( 3.75,0 )    the hard parton - level processes must be calculated and combined with pdfs in a mc program designed to generate the desired distribution of partons plus mixed qcd and qed bremsstrahlung .",
    "this will require a careful implementation of the multiple gluon and photon phase space .",
    "experience in the electroweak sector suggests that yfs exponentiation will provide a strong tool for implementing the multiple - emission phase space , giving very precise control over the soft and collinear limits .",
    "the large numbers of diagrams creates a challenge for obtaining an expression that can be evaluated quickly enough for mc implementation , and evaluated in a numerically stable manner .",
    "common reduction methods based on the passarino - veltman technique@xcite can produce millions of terms , which are both slow to evaluate in a mc setting , and prone to numerical instabilities due to the large numbers of terms added and potential cancellations among them .",
    "thus , a significant part of this problem will involve developing and testing new methods for organizing and calculating the terms in a stable manner .",
    "once the parton - level matrix element is obtained , it may be incorporated into a `` qced - exponentiated '' mc program , implementing a procedure similar to yfs exponentiation in a combined qed and qcd setting to construct the exact phase space for multiple gluon and photon radiation .",
    "this requires extending the yfs calculus to non - abelian gauge theory , with due care in handling the genuine non - abelian singularities which arise in qcd",
    ". the qcd and qed exponentiation will be conducted at order @xmath44 on an event - by - event basis in the presence of showers without double - counting of soft and collinear emission effects .",
    "further details of this construction will be presented elsewhere in these proceedings.@xcite",
    "a careful calculation of higher - order bremsstrahlung corrections led to a precision tool ( bhlumi ) for bhabha luminosity calculations .",
    "incorporating the second order photonic corrections obtained to test bhlumi s precision may be enough to reach the 0.01% level proposed for the ilc . calculating the @xmath5 up - down interference contribution will help to clarify this .",
    "a number of second - order bhabha scattering results are now available which should be useful for testing bhlumi s precision at this higher level .",
    "we have also described cross - checks on the second - order photonic radiative corrections for fermion pair production developed for the @xmath0mc .",
    "comparisons with similar initial - state radiative corrections developed for phokhara show agreement on the order of @xmath45 in units of the born cross section at ilc energies .",
    "remaining differences may be attributed primarily to differences in the handling of finite mass corrections in the collinear limits , and possible residual numerical instabilities for photons radiated near the fermion pair production threshold .",
    "finally , we have outlined a program for carrying the successes of the yfs - exponentiated mc framework developed for slc and lep physics into the hadronic realm of the lhc , where a precise calculation of the parton - level diagrams can be combined with a combined qcd and qed exponentiation framework , with complete control of the multiple photon and gluon phase space , to develop a mc for the drell - yan process which can reach the lhc precision requirements .",
