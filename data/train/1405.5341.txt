    "this article deals with some algorithmic questions related to linear differential operators in positive characteristic @xmath0 .",
    "more precisely , we address the problem of the efficient computation of the characteristic polynomial of the @xmath0-curvature of such a differential operator @xmath1 . roughly speaking , the @xmath0-curvature of @xmath1 is a matrix that measures to what extent the solution space of @xmath1 has dimension close to its order .",
    "the theory was initiated in the 1970s by katz , dwork and honda  @xcite in connection with one of grothendieck s conjectures which states that an irreducible linear differential operator with coefficients in @xmath5 admits a basis of algebraic solutions over @xmath5 if and only if its reductions modulo @xmath0 admit a zero @xmath0-curvature for almost all primes @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath6 be _ any _ field of characteristic  @xmath0 , and let @xmath7 be the algebra of differential operators with coefficients in @xmath8 , with the commutation rule @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath0-curvature of a differential operator @xmath1 of order @xmath10 in @xmath11 , hereafter denoted @xmath12 , is the @xmath13 matrix with coefficients in @xmath8 , whose @xmath14 entry is the coefficient of @xmath15 in the remainder of the euclidean ( right ) division of @xmath16 by @xmath1 , for @xmath17 .",
    "we focus on the computation in good complexity , notably with respect to the parameter  @xmath0 , of the characteristic polynomial @xmath2 of the @xmath0-curvature @xmath18 .",
    "an important sub - task is to decide efficiently whether @xmath18 is nilpotent . by a celebrated theorem of the chudnovskys  @xcite ,",
    "least order differential operators satisfied by @xmath19-series possess reductions modulo @xmath0 with nilpotent @xmath0-curvatures for almost all primes  @xmath0 .    studying the complexity of the computation of @xmath2",
    "is an interesting problem in its own right .",
    "this computation is for instance one of the basic steps in algorithms for factoring linear differential operators in characteristic  @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "additional motivations for studying this question come from concrete applications , in combinatorics  @xcite and in statistical physics  @xcite , where the @xmath0-curvature serves as an _ a posteriori _ certification filter for differential operators obtained by guessing techniques from power series expansions . in such applications ,",
    "the prime number @xmath0 may be quite large ( thousands , or tens of thousands ) , since its value is lower bounded by the precision of the power series needed by guessing , which is typically large for operators of large size .",
    "this explains our choice of considering @xmath0 as the most important complexity parameter .",
    "* previous work . *",
    "since @xmath7 is noncommutative , binary powering can not be used to compute @xmath20 .",
    "katz  @xcite gave the first algorithm for @xmath12 , based on the recurrence @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the companion matrix associated to @xmath1 .",

    "the first subquadratic algorithm was designed in  @xcite .",
    "it has complexity @xmath4 and it is based on the observation that the @xmath0-curvature @xmath18 is obtained by applying the matrix operator @xmath23 to  @xmath24 , and on a baby steps / giant steps algorithm for applying differential operators to polynomials .    several partial results concerning the @xmath0-curvature were obtained in  @xcite : computation of @xmath18 in @xmath25 for _ first order _ operators and in quasi - linear time @xmath26 for _ certain second order _",
    "operators ; algorithms of complexity @xmath27 for deciding nilpotency of @xmath12 for _ second order _ operators , and @xmath26 for the nullity of @xmath12 for _ arbitrary operators_.    * our contribution . *",
    "prior to this work , the computation of the characteristic polynomial of the @xmath0-curvature required the computation of the @xmath0-curvature itself as a preliminary step .",
    "we manage to compute @xmath2 without @xmath18 by exploiting in a completely explicit and elementary way the fact that the weyl algebra @xmath28\\langle \\partial \\rangle$ ] is a central separable ( azumaya ) algebra over its centre @xmath29   $ ] , and thus endowed with a _ reduced norm map _  @xcite .",
    "our crucial observation is that the characteristic polynomials of the @xmath0-curvature of elements in @xmath11 are closely related to other polynomials associated to operators lying in the skew ring @xmath30 on which the multiplication is determined by the rule @xmath31 .",
    "more precisely , given such an operator @xmath1 , we define its @xmath0-curvature @xmath32 and compare its characteristic polynomial to that of @xmath12 when @xmath1 makes sense in both rings @xmath11 and @xmath33 ( theorem  [ theo : comparison ] ) .",
    "in addition , the computation of the characteristic polynomial of @xmath32 reduces to that of a matrix factorial of length @xmath0 , which can be performed in @xmath3 operations in  @xmath6 via the baby steps / giant steps approach in  @xcite .",
    "this allows us to compute @xmath2 in complexity quasi - linear in @xmath34 .",
