    "in the last years , more and more experimental evidence concerning neutron distributions in nuclei has become available @xcite . in particular",
    ", it has been found that several neutron rich nuclei display a neutron skin or even a neutron ` stratosphere ' called the neutron halo .",
    "such properties of neutron distributions have been predicted by the asymptotic density model @xcite , the relativistic mean field theory @xcite , and hartree - fock calculations with skyrme forces @xcite .    with the increasing amount of experimental data available , halo factors",
    "can now be used as an additional test of nuclear effective interactions .",
    "namely , microscopic approaches should be able to reproduce not only binding energies and charge radii , but also the detail of density distributions , especially density tails at large distance from the nucleus center .",
    "the aim of this work is to perform such a test for the effective interaction proposed by gogny @xcite .",
    "while many applications have shown the high quality of this force for describing a wide range of nuclear properties [ 47 ] , no systematic study in this direction has been made up to now . the mean - field theory employed with the gogny force",
    "is applied to nineteen halo nuclei found in @xcite .",
    "we calculate neutron and proton density distributions at large distance , one- and two - neutron separation energies , and the halo factors related to the probability of annihilation of antiproton from atomic  like orbitals .",
    "these results are compared with experimental data and with hartree - fock calculations performed with the sly4 interaction @xcite .    in section 2 ,",
    "we recall the form of the gogny effective interaction and we describe the method by which the results mentioned above are obtained numerically . in section 3 , neutron separation energies and density distributions at large distance from the center of the nucleus are analyzed . in section 4 , the prescription employed for evaluating halo factors is given and the theoretical values obtained are compared with experimental data . conclusions and plans for further investigations are presented at the end of the paper .",
    "the gogny two  body effective nuclear interaction has the following form @xcite : @xmath0 \\cdot ( w_i+b_i\\hat p_\\sigma - h_i\\hat p_\\tau - m_i\\hat p_\\sigma\\hat p_\\tau)+ \\nonumber\\\\ + t_3 ( 1 + x_0\\hat p_\\sigma)\\,\\delta ( \\vec r_1 - \\vec r_2 ) \\left[\\rho\\left({\\vec",

    "@xmath2 is the space coordinate of nucleon @xmath3 , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the exchange operators of spin and isospin variables , respectively . the second line of eq .",
    "( 1 ) describes a two - body zero - range density ",
    "dependent interaction .",
    "the last line contains a two - body zero - range spin  orbit term and the coulomb potential between protons . here ,",
