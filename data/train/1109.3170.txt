    "the discovery of high - temperature superconductivity in the iron - based layered compound lafeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 @xcite immediately created considerable excitement among condensed matter scientists .",
    "other superconductors belonging to the same re-1111 family , with re a rare - earth metal , were discovered successively and superconductivity with a transition temperature of up to 55 k was found when la is substituted by other rare earths as e.g.  sm , ce , nd , pr , and gd.@xcite the new compounds show strong similarities with the high-@xmath5 cuprates:@xcite _ i _ ) they have layered crystal structures with alternating reo and feas planes , where the iron ions are arranged on a simple square lattice , _ ii _ ) the parent compound is antiferromagnetically ordered , _ iii _ ) superconductivity emerges upon doping the parent compound with either electrons or holes , a process which suppresses the magnetic order .",
    "however , there are also important differences between the two families , among which two are particularly significant : the semi - metallicity of the iron - based parent compound , as opposed to the mott - insulator character of cuprates , and the moderate degree of electron correlation in the former vs.  the strong correlation observed in the latter , as from comparative studies of far - infrared reflection.@xcite    the refeaso parent compounds generally show a commensurate spin - density wave ( sdw ) magnetic order characterized by _ strongly reduced _ fe momenta , as evidenced by standard neutron scattering studies:@xcite fe magnetic moments are comprised between 0.25 and 0.8  @xmath6 , to be compared with 4 @xmath6 , the spin - only value for the fe@xmath7 ion .",
    "for this very reason , the determination of the temperature dependence of the magnetic order parameter via sensitive local probe techniques , such as muon - spin rotation,@xcite mssbauer spectroscopy,@xcite electron spin resonance ( esr),@xcite or nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr)@xcite is supposed to provide a higher accuracy than that possible using standard powder neutron scattering.@xcite currently , the accepted magnetic moment value for iron at 2 k in the refeaso families is 0.63(1 ) @xmath6,@xcite seemingly independent of the rare earth .",
    "the study of magnetism of these systems is crucial : its disappearance often signals the onset of superconductivity .",
    "since the coexistence of the magnetic ( m ) and superconducting ( sc ) orders in interspersed nanoscopic domains has been generally associated to unconventional superconductivity , it is of fundamental interest to discover whether the antiferromagnetism persist also in the superconducting phase , or it simply disappears as soon as the sc phase is established .",
    "also the possible role played by the ordering of the rare - earth magnetic moments is not yet clear .    among the 1111 compounds",
    "the case of cefeaso@xmath0f@xmath1  is paradigmatic of this situation .",
    "it was first investigated via neutron diffraction@xcite , whose results suggested that both the magnetic and the superconducting order parameters go to zero at the m - sc boundary , thus hinting at the possibility of a quantum critical point ( qcp ) separating a long - range , anti - ferromagnetically ordered phase from the superconducting phase .",
    "this , however , is in contrast with the presence of a nanoscopic coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity , as evidenced in our recent study of cefeaso@xmath0f@xmath1  for @xmath8.@xcite this apparent discrepancy can be solved by observing that standard neutron diffraction is sensitive only to long - range magnetic order .",
    "in addition , also @xcite have observed an anomalous @xmath9sr relaxation in a similarly doped ce - compound . to date , though , no systematic studies exist to establish whether the long - range magnetic order becomes short - ranged , or it simply vanishes as the superconductivity appears .",
    "a study of the evolution with doping of the magnetic order in the feas planes can , therefore , provide us with fundamental hints on the interplay between the superconductivity and magnetism , i.e.  whether these two phases are competing or reinforcing each other .    to address the above issues we carried out systematic @xmath9sr investigations in the cefeaso@xmath0f@xmath1  system in a large doping range @xmath2 .",
    "due to their local probe character and to the high sensitivity to internal magnetic fields , muons are perfect for unraveling the complex interplay between magnetism and superconductivity in the iron - based superconductors . in the specific case of cefeaso@xmath0f@xmath1  we find that as the fluorine content increases the magnetically ordered phase does not disappear , even at the highest investigated @xmath2 concentrations , where it coexists with sc .",

    "if @xmath102 is of the same order of or higher than the internal static fields , then it will have a large influence on the muon polarization through a `` spin - locking '' effect . on the other hand , in case of strongly fluctuating internal fields the effect of the external field is barely noticeable . by applying longitudinal fields in the range 0 to 500 mt",
