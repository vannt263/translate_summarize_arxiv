    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) materials have attracted great attention in the fields of nanoscale materials and nanotechnology since the experimental realization of graphene@xcite , which possesses remarkable mechanical , electronic and optical properties@xcite possibly leading to many novel applications in microelectronic and optoelectronic devices . a large number of graphene - like structures and other layered structures with different chemical compositions and different crystal structures have been proposed and synthesised since then .",
    "recently , zhang _ _ et al.__@xcite , predicted a new 2d material composed of carbon pentagons , @xmath1 penta - graphene , with mixed @xmath5 orbital hybridization , which is dynamically and mechanically stable , and can withstand temperatures as high as 1000 @xmath6 .",
    "monolayer penta - graphene possesses unusual negative poisson s ratio , ultrahigh ideal strength outperforming graphene and other interesting electronic properties @xcite , which make it a potential candidate for wide applications in the optoelectronics and photovoltaics devices .",
    "many efforts have been devoted on the discovery of new 2d materials with penta strcuture since the successful prediction of penta - graphene .",
    "the silicon counterpart of the penta structure was proposed as well , although it is dynamically instable in the monolayer form@xcite . recently ,",
    "a novel pentagonal structure composed of carbon and silicon atoms in a @xmath7 hybridization , @xmath1 pentagonal silicon dicarbide ( penta - sic@xmath0)@xcite , is proposed and further confirmed to be dynamically stable and exhibits enhanced similar electronic property compared to penta - graphene .    during the processes of experimental realization of 2d materials , mismatch between 2d material and substrate often results in the formation of crystal distortion due to strain or stress modulation .",
    "experimental measurements of physical properties of 2d materials could be different from those with perfect structures .",
    "therefore it is necessary to investigate the strain - dependence properties of 2d materials comparing experimental results .",
    "in addition , strain - engineering ( external strain and stress ) is an effective way to modulate the electronic , mechanical , optical properties and transport of 2d materials@xcite .",
    "it has been reported that strain engineering can be used to modulate the electronic properties of mos@xmath0@xcite , black phosphorene@xcite , tis@xmath8@xcite and res@xmath0@xcite .",
    "the strain - engineering method was proved to be effective in increasing the band gap of pengta - sic@xmath0@xcite as well .",
    "however , further investigation on the carrier mobility of monolayer penta - sic@xmath0 under various strain has not been addressed .    in this work ,",
    "we systematically investigate electronic , mechanical and transport properties of monolayer penta - sic@xmath0 under tensile and compressive strain by using first - principles calculations .",
    "we find that under in - plane uniaxial strain , penta - sic@xmath0 remains an indirect semiconductor until @xmath9 , however , the uniaxial compressive strain can easily converted it from semiconducting into metallic beyond @xmath10 .",
    "when applying a biaxial strain , penta - sic@xmath0 can change from semiconductor to metallic material under relatively low compressive strain of @xmath11 .",
    "in general , the electronic band structure of penta - sic@xmath0 is sensitive to tensile and compressive strain .",
    "moreover , we have quantitatively demonstrated that the carrier mobility can be enhanced from 2.59 @xmath2 to 1.14 @xmath3 by applying a uniaxial compressive strain .",
    "the calculations are performed using the vienna _ ab - initio _ simulation package ( vasp ) based on density functional theory @xcite .",
    "the exchange - correlation energy is described by the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) using the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) functional .",
    "the calculationa are carried out by using the projector - augmented - wave pseudo potential method with a plane wave basis set with a kinetic energy cutoff of 500 ev . when optimizing atomic positions , the energy convergence value between two consecutive steps is chosen as 10@xmath12 ev and the maximum hellmann - feynman force acting on each atom",

    "the monkhorst - pack scheme is performed for the brillouin zone integration with k - point meshes of 13@xmath1413@xmath141 and 21@xmath1421@xmath141 for geometry optimization and self - consistent electronic structure calculations , respectively . to verify the results of the pbe calculations , the electronic structure of penta - sic@xmath0 with zero strain",
    "is calculated using hybrid heyd - scuseria - ernzerhof ( hse06 ) functional@xcite .",
    "hse06 improves the precision of band gap by reducing the localization and delocalization errors of pbe and hf functionals .",
    "the mixing ratio used in the hse06 is 25@xmath15 for short - range hartree - fock exchange .",

    "[ structure](a ) and ( b ) , all pentagons contain four equivalent si - c bonds and one c - c bond with three atomic layers ( two c atom layers on the top and bottom , and si atom layer in the middle ) . as shown in table .",
    "[ tabel-1 ] , the associated lattice constant of penta - sic@xmath0 is @xmath22=@xmath23=4.41 @xmath24 with the buckling height @xmath20=1.33 @xmath24 .",
    "the bonding lengths are @xmath18=1.91 @xmath24 and @xmath19=1.36 @xmath24 , which are in good agreement with previously theoretical results@xcite . to avoid artificial interaction between atom layers , the separation between the layers is set to be 15 @xmath24 for monolayer penta - sic@xmath0 .",
    "the pbe calculations show that , sic@xmath0 is a semiconductor with an indirect band gap of 1.39 ev , and the minimum of the conduction band ( vbm ) is located at s point , the maximum of the valence band ( vbm ) is located between s and @xmath25 points .",
    "the corresponding hse06 calculation gives a larger band gap of 2.85 ev comparing to the pbe result since pbe always underestimates the value of band gap of semiconductors .",
    "[ structure](c ) shows the pbe calculations of orbital - projected electronic band structures and density of states ( dos ) of penta - sic@xmath0 .",
    "analysis on the pdos ( si-3@xmath26 , 3@xmath27 and c-2@xmath26 , 2@xmath27 orbitals ) of penta - sic@xmath0 reveals that c-2@xmath27 and si-3@xmath27 orbitals mainly dominate the electronic states near the fermi level .",
    "however , the contributions by the c-2@xmath27 states to the total dos is larger than that by si-3@xmath27 , and in the energy range of -2 to 0 ev for valence band , the si-3p states contribute larger than that by c-2@xmath27 , indicating the strong hybridization between the si @xmath28 states and c @xmath29 states .",
    "the analysis on the chemical bonding of pengta - sic@xmath0 based on the dos is in consistency with the calculated bond lengths , which show an identical length of si - c bonding .",
    "the four identical bond lengths and bonding angles indicate that si atom connects to the four neighboring c atoms via @xmath30 hybridization",

    "[ mobility - bi ] , since all the three decisive parameters ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) increase by applying tensile and compressive strain , the hole mobilities for strained structures are thus smaller than that without strain according to eq .",

    "the obtained electron mobility increases monotonically from @xmath35 to @xmath36 , mainly caused by the decrease of the effective mass @xmath37 .",

    "sic@xmath0 is found to be a semiconductor with a direct band gap of 1.39 ev , and hse06 functional gives the band gap of 2.85 ev . by employing voigt notation ,",

    "the transition point from semiconductor to metal is different between uniaxial and biaxial strains .",
    "the hole mobility along b - direction can be significantly improved by a - direction compressive strain .",
