    "at the hera collider at desy ( hamburg , germany ) , 820 gev protons collide with 27.5 gev electrons or positrons . in fig .",
    "[ fig : kin_for](a ) , a diagram of the reaction @xmath1 is shown . a photon @xmath2 with virtuality @xmath3is emitted at the electron vertex .",
    "@xmath4 is used to denote the centre of mass energy of the virtual photon - proton ( @xmath5 ) system and @xmath6 are the standard bjorken variables .",
    "the mass of the proton is denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "in addition , leading baryons ( lb ) are described by two other variables : t , the square of the four - momentum transfer at the proton vertex , defined as @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the fraction of the incoming proton momentum carried by the leading baryon , defined as @xmath10 .    in the following",
    ", deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) events are defined as those having photon virtuality @xmath11 gev@xmath12 and the energy of the scattered electron @xmath13 gev , while photoproduction ( php ) events have @xmath14 gev@xmath12 and @xmath15 gev .",
    "the zeus detector@xcite , one of the two general purpose detectors at hera , is instrumented with high resolution calorimeters and tracking chambers . in the far forward direction defined as : @xmath16 .",
    "the central zeus calorimeter measures up to @xmath17 . ] , it is equipped with a lead scintillator calorimeter@xcite ( forward neutron calorimeter , fnc ) , located 106 m downstream of the nominal interaction point , and with a leading proton spectrometer@xcite ( lps ) , consisting of silicon strip detectors operating inside movable roman pots located in six stations between 23 and 90 m downstream of the interaction region , fig  [ fig : kin_for ] b ) .",
    "fig  [ fig : dis_prop ] a ) shows the fraction of dis events with a ln with @xmath18 as a function of and w ( the ratio is uncorrected for detector acceptance ) .",
    "as can be seen from these plots , and analogous ones for events with a lp , the fraction of dis events with a lb is independent of x , y , and .    to estimate the fraction of events with a lp generated by pomeron exchange , the ` gapcut ' selection method was introduced .",
    "an event is accepted by gapcut if either the pseudorapidity of the most forward energy deposition in the central detector is less than 1.8 or a pseudorapidity gap of at least 1.5 units with its forward edge between @xmath19 is present . according to mc studies , gapcut has an efficiency of 40 - 60% for pomeron mediated events , while it rejects non pomeron events with an efficiency @xmath20 .",
    "fig  [ fig : dis_prop ] b ) shows the @xmath9@xmath21 spectrum for all dis events , for those events that pass gapcut and the ratio of the two spectra .",
    "it is clear from this picture that only a small fraction of events with @xmath22 is generated by pomeron exchange .",
    "lb production has been studied both at high and low .",
    "fig  [ fig : xlfnc_lps ] a ) shows the @xmath9@xmath21 spectra for lp measured in dis and php events while fig  [ fig : xlfnc_lps ] b ) shows the @xmath9@xmath21 spectra for ln measured in dis events and in interactions of the proton beam with gas in the beam - pipe .",
    "both a ) and b ) are not corrected for lps or fnc acceptance so they can not be directly compared with each other . in both figures , the relative normalization of the two spectra is arbitrary .",
    "the similarity of the two spectra in each figure is remarkable , suggesting a production mechanism that does not depend on the type of interaction .    for lp ,",
    "the @xmath9@xmath21 spectrum was divided into ten bins , and in each bin the t distribution was fitted using a simple exponential @xmath23 .",
    "three different t ranges have been tried for the fit ( @xmath24 ) and no systematic effect on the result was observed .",
    "fig  [ fig : fig4 ] , on the left , shows the bins available for the fit . on the right",
    ", the top figure shows the measured ` b ' values as a function of @xmath9@xmath21 while on the bottom the acceptance corrected fraction of dis events with a leading proton in a given @xmath25 bin is shown .",
    "this plot shows that 8 - 10  % of dis events have a lp in the interval @xmath26 . for ln@xcite , in the interval @xmath27 , this fraction is @xmath28  % .",
    "these two measurements , even if both have large errors , indicate that events with a lb represent a significant fraction of all dis events and that the amount of lp and ln is comparable",
    ".    the values of b in bins of @xmath9@xmath21 are compared to different mc models in fig  [ fig : fig5 ] .",
    "lepto6.5@xcite , which generates lb via ` soft colour interaction ' and is proposed as a model capable to explain all aspects of dis events , including lb production and diffraction , fails to reproduce the data .",
    "lepto6.5 also predicts a fraction of gapcut events much higher than measured .",
    "rapgap@xcite and epsoft@xcite , which both describe diffractive scattering , have been used to simulate both single ( sd ) and double diffraction ( dd)(in dd the proton also breaks up and a leading proton with @xmath9@xmath291 can be generated in the fragmentation ) .",
    "these models however can not be compared to the data over the whole @xmath9@xmath21 range since they simulate only the events produced by pomeron exchange which are , according to fig  [ fig : dis_prop ] a ) , only a small fraction of the total sample at low @xmath9 . for @xmath9@xmath300.95 ,",
    "where pomeron exchange dominates , data and the various mc predictions agree .",
    "rapgap was also used to generate ` pion exchange ' events , in which the virtual photon scatters off a pion generated at the proton vertex via the processes @xmath31 . according to @xcite",
    ", pion exchange is expected to dominate the cross section for lb production in the interval @xmath32 .",
    "fig  [ fig : fig5 ] d ) shows that this model agrees well with the data in this interval .",
    "the value of the slope parameter ` b ' was also measured in two large @xmath9@xmath21 intervals , @xmath33 , for the subset of events that pass gapcut . in both intervals ,",
    "the value @xmath34 is consistent with the values of the lp measured in all dis events as if the fact that the interaction is diffractive did not influence the properties of the lp .",
