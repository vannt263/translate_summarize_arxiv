    "flaring of the hi disk and the coherence of the sagittarius tidal stream both imply a nearly spherical inner halo with @xmath4 ( e.g. , olling & merrifield 2000 ; ibata 2001 ) .",
    "in other systems , the ellipticities of galaxies and clusters inferred from x - ray and optical isophotes ( e.g. , buote & canizares 1996 ) and galaxy halos in weak lensing measurements ( hoekstra 2004 ) are generally in the range @xmath5 .",

    "the first set follows the dynamics of gas `` adiabatically '' , without radiative cooling .",
    "the second set includes gas cooling , star formation , metal enrichment , thermal supernovae feedback , and uv heating by an ionizing background .",
    "all cosmological simulations were performed with the adaptive refinement tree code ( kravtsov 1999 ) . for details on the simulations we refer the reader to kazantzidis ( 2004 ) .",
    "we determine principle axis ratios @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( @xmath13 ) in differential radial bins using the modified inertia tensor ( dubinski & carlberg 1991 ) as described in detail in kazantzidis ( 2004 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] summarizes our results .",
    "the top panel shows the average change in the axis ratios of _ dm _ in cooling and adiabatic runs [ e.g. , @xmath14 as a function of radius for all cosmological simulations . in the inner regions of halos , gas cooling increases axis ratios by @xmath15 at @xmath16 and by @xmath17 at @xmath18 .",
    "the difference decreases with radius , but persists out to the virial radius . in the bottom panels , we present the distribution of _ subhalo _ shapes in the simulated clusters .",
    "the subhalo axis ratios we quote are based on particles within one half of the subhalo tidal radius , @xmath19 , and we analyzed only subhalos resolved with @xmath20 particles within @xmath21 .",
    "the masses of subhalos selected by these criteria range roughly from @xmath22 .",
    "we show for comparison the shape distribution of collisionless _ field _",
    "halos for similar masses from js02 ( solid line ) .",
    "first , subhalos in dissipationless cosmological simulations are considerably rounder than field halos , a result also reported by moore ( 2004 ) .",
    "second , dissipational simulations predict rounder subhalos with a much more narrowly - peaked distribution of axis ratios .    in the cdm paradigm , galaxies form from the condensation of baryons in halo centers .",
    "as the central baryonic concentration grows and forms a disk or a spherical system , the overall mass distribution becomes more centrally concentrated and the central potential becomes rounder .",
    "the box orbits of dm particles in the central parts that serve as the backbone of a triaxial mass distribution , adjust to the presence of this rounder potential and are changing into less elongated forms ( e.g. gerhard & binney 1985 ) .",
    "in a few crossing times , most of the remaining box orbits will be destroyed as the overall potential becomes rounder .",
    "this transformation of orbital families drives halos to a more spherical shape , even at large radii , as our simulations demonstrate .",

    "_ solid _ lines correspond to the adiabatic simulation , while the _ dotted _ lines show the results of the simulation with radiative cooling .",
    "the _ dashed _ lines show the dm shape profile in a simulation with cooling artificially turned off at @xmath24 , resulting in a cold baryon fraction similar to that in observed galaxy clusters .",
    "[ fig2],width=302 ]      current hydrodynamical cosmological simulations of clusters may suffer from the `` overcooling '' problem : the predicted fraction of cold baryons ( stars and cold gas ) @xmath25 , is a factor of @xmath26 higher than observed ( lin 2003 ) .",
    "indeed , in our simulated clusters @xmath27 , a factor of @xmath28 higher than observed for systems in the mass range we consider .",
    "thus , the effect of dissipation on halo shapes may be overestimated .    to assess the extent of the problem , we repeated one of the cluster simulations with radiative cooling _",
    "artificially _ turned off at @xmath24 .",
    "this simulation was designed to reproduce the observed value of @xmath29 at @xmath30 .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the dm axis ratio profiles for the three different runs .",
    "the effect of dissipation in the simulation with radiative cooling turned off is smaller than in the original simulation , as fewer baryons condense in the center , yet the shape of the dm distribution is still considerably more spherical than in the adiabatic run .",
    "this result suggests that the effect of gas cooling on halo shapes is substantial even in simulations with realistic cold baryon fractions .",
    "in this section , we analyze high - resolution simulations of binary equal - mass mergers of disk galaxies including different physical processes .",
    "we simulate purely collisionless mergers and mergers in which we follow the gas dynamics adiabatically .",
    "a third set of simulations includes radiative cooling , while in a fourth set we also incorporate star formation .",
    "we construct galaxy models using the technique of hernquist ( 1993 ) with structural parameters consistent with standard ( mo 1998 ) .",
    "each galaxy consists of a spherical and isotropic navarro ( 1996 ) dm halo and an exponential stellar disk , and may contain a spherical , hernquist ( 1990 ) bulge and/or an exponential gaseous disk .",
    "the dark halo mass and total disk mass are constant in all initial galaxy models .",
    "we considered collisions on parabolic orbits with two encounter geometries ( randomly - inclined and coplanar disk orientations ) , two values for the gas fraction ( 10% and 50% of the total disk mass ) , and two values for the disk thickness .",
    "all merger simulations were performed with the gasoline treesph @xmath1-body code ( wadsley 2004 ) .",
    "for further details on the merger simulations we refer the reader to kazantzidis ( 2004 ) and kazantzidis ( 2005 ) .    in the top panels of figure  [ fig3 ] , we present radial profiles @xmath8 and @xmath9 for remnants in _ collisionless _ , equal - mass binary merger simulations of halos with embedded stellar disks . for comparison",
    "we also show results of a dm halo - only merger .",
    "inclined disk mergers produce nearly spherical stellar remnants , while coplanar mergers yield a disk - like stellar remnant with @xmath31 .",
    "the corresponding dm distribution is also more spherical in the inclined disk merger .",
    "however , in an inclined disk merger with the same orbital parameters as before , but with a factor of three thicker stellar disks , we find that the stellar remnant becomes less spherical and the halo axis ratios are lower by @xmath32 in the inner regions .",
    "these results indicate that the shape of the stellar remnant is sensitive to the mutual orientation and internal properties of the merging disks .",
    "the presence of a stellar remnant modifies the potential in the central region , where stars dominate gravitationally , and consequently affects the shape of the dm distribution .    .",

    "the _ left _ panel shows results for the dm , while the _ right _ panel shows results for the stellar distributions .",
    "_ thin _ and _ thick _ lines correspond to simulations with gas fractions of @xmath33 and @xmath34 in the initial merging disks , respectively .",
    "different physical processes are included in each merger as indicated in the panels .",
    ", width=453 ]    the lower panels of figure  [ fig3 ] show results for collisionless and hydrodynamical equal - mass , binary merger simulations of disk galaxies containing bulges .",
    "dissipational mergers lead to an increase in axis ratios of dm that sensitively depends on the details of gas physics included in the simulations .",
    "the largest increase occurs in dissipational simulations which exhibit the deepest central potentials . in the adiabatic simulations , axis ratios are close to those of the collisionless runs because the gas is too hot ( @xmath35  k ) to build up a significant central mass concentration . since the dm responds to the _ total _ baryonic density enhancement dm axis ratios are similar in all dissipational mergers .",
    "the dissipative infall of gas during galaxy formation alleviates the discrepancy between the shape distribution of collisionless dm halos and that of observed systems . using high - resolution cosmological simulations we show that halos in simulations with radiative cooling are considerably more spherical than those in dissipationless simulations .",
    "dissipation results in an average increase in principal axis ratios of halos by @xmath0 in the inner regions .",
    "the difference decreases slowly with radius but remains substantial even at the virial radius .",
    "subhalos also exhibit a similar trend of increased axis ratios in dissipational simulations and are generally rounder than corresponding field halos .",
    "we also showed that in an _ ad hoc _ cluster formation simulation designed to reproduce the observed cold baryon fraction , the dm halo is still notably rounder at all radii compared to its dissipationless counterpart , suggesting that our results are robust despite any issues of overcooling in simulated clusters .    in hierarchical cdm models of structure formation ,",
    "halos grow during periods of slow accretion , when gas cools and condenses toward the center , and sequences of violent mergers .",
    "we performed a comprehensive series of collisionless and gasdynamical binary merger simulations between disk galaxies to study the effect of baryons on the shape of the remnant dm distributions .",
    "collisionless simulations indicate a strong correlation between the shape of the stellar remnant and dm halo shape . in dissipational mergers , strong gas inflows and",
    "star formation drive the remnant dm distribution to be significantly more spherical .",
    "all of the results reported in this study underscore the crucial role of baryonic processes in comparing the small scale predictions of the paradigm with observations .",
