    "letter _ we focus on strong gravitational lensing and examine the effect of the equation of state @xmath0 on the probabilities of producing multiply lensed systems . the number of expected lenses as a function of image separation provides a potential means of constraining @xmath0 because it is determined by factors such as the angular diameter distances to the lens and the source , the lensing cross sections , and the number density of the lenses , each of which depends on @xmath0 .",
    "this type of study is timely in view of the completion of the jodrell - vla astrometric survey ( jvas ; e.g. , patnaik et al .  1992 ; king et al .  1999 ) and the cosmic lens all - sky survey ( class ; e.g. , myers et al .  1999 , 2001 ) , which together provide the largest uniformly selected sample of radio lens systems and have yielded 18 new lenses thus far .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) will further increase the source population by one to two orders of magnitude .    since lensing probes the mass and not the light distribution , we model the lenses as a population of dark matter halos with an improved version of the press - schechter ( 1974 ) mass function . for galaxy - size lenses , we follow the tradition in lensing studies and use the singular isothermal spheres ( sis ) as the mass profile ( e.g. , turner et al .",

    "this approach allows us to calculate both small - separation ( galaxy - based ) and wide - separation ( dark matter - based ) lensing phenomena concurrently .",
    "it also enables us to relate the lensing probabilities directly to cosmological parameters through the mass power spectrum that governs the number density of lenses , and the lensing cross sections . approximating lenses with a mixture of sis and dark matter profiles is supported by simple baryon cooling models ( keeton 1998 ; kochanek & white 2001 ) and has been used recently to study the link between strong lensing and distant supernovae ( porciani & madau 2000 ) , halo density profiles ( keeton & madau 2001 ; takahashi & chiba 2001 ; wyithe et al . 2001 ) , and @xmath6 and @xmath13 ( li & ostriker 2001 ) .",
    "these studies , however , have assumed @xmath14 .",
    "as we will show , relaxing the @xmath14 assumption can have a significant effect on the lensing probabilities , in particular at wide angular separations .",
    "in this _ letter _ we consider cosmological models with a present - day density parameter of @xmath15 in matter ( with 0.05 in baryons and 0.3 in cold dark matter ( cdm ) ) , @xmath16 in dark energy , and hubble parameter @xmath17 .",
    "for the dark energy component , we analyze the standard cosmological constant ( @xmath18 ) and models with @xmath19 .",
    "this set of parameters is chosen to lie well inside the concordance region given by large scale structure observations ( see wang et al .",

    "the lensing cross section @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) depends on the mass profile of the lenses . since our interest is to predict the lensing probability over a wide range of image separations , we consider both galaxy - size halos that are responsible for lens systems of a few arcseconds , and cluster - size halos for larger @xmath1 . in the former case , we approximate the galaxy mass distribution as an sis with a density profile @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the 1-d velocity dispersion .",

    "other than the virial mass , this profile is described by a concentration parameter @xmath62 , where @xmath41 is the virial radius of the halo discussed earlier , and @xmath63 is a scale radius . for @xmath64 ,",
    "we take into account both the mass and redshift dependence and use the relation of bullock et al .",

    "the lensing cross section for nfw halos is determined by the parameter @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the critical surface mass density .",
    "an nfw halo will have multiple images if the source is within the radial caustic of angular size @xmath71 from the halo center .",
    "we compute @xmath71 as a function of halo mass , lens redshift , and source redshift by solving @xmath72 , where @xmath73 and @xmath1 are the positions of the source and the image , respectively .",
    "the cross section for lensing by an nfw halo is then @xmath74 .",
    "we also need to determine the halo mass @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) . here",
    "we use the fact that the angular separation of the outermost images is insensitive to the value of @xmath73 ( schneider et al .",
    "1992 ) and simplify the calculations by using @xmath75 for a perfectly aligned source - lens configuration .",
    "we assume a `` cooling mass '' of @xmath76 , above which the lenses are assigned the nfw profile and below which the lenses are sis .",
    "uncertainties introduced by @xmath77 on the lensing probability are discussed in ",
    "3 .    to compare the predicted lensing probabilities with observational results , we use the combined data from jvas and class , which offer the largest uniformly selected sample of gravitational lens systems .",
    "these surveys have discovered 18 lenses among a sample of @xmath78 12000 flat - spectrum radio sources ( browne & myers 2000 ; browne et al.2001 ; myers et al .",
    "a robust statistical analysis requires that careful cuts be made to the above sample , and this will be discussed in detail by browne et al .",
    "however , because preliminary estimates indicate that the lensing rate will not differ much from the @xmath79 value derived here , we will assume a sample of 18 lenses and 12000 sources in the present analysis .",
    "raw optical depths must be corrected to account for the magnification bias , which leads to an over - representation of lensed sources in any flux - limited sample ( e.g. , turner et al .",
    "1984 ; maoz & rix 1993 ) .",
    "magnification bias enhances the lensing probability of sources in a bin of total flux density ( @xmath80 ) by the factor @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the source luminosity function and @xmath83 is the distribution of total magnifications ( @xmath84 , where the magnification of the @xmath85th image is @xmath86 ) produced by the lens .",
    "the sources probed by class are well - represented by a power - law luminosity function , @xmath87 , with @xmath88 ( rusin & tegmark 2001 ) .",
    "the bias thus reduces to a simple form that is independent of flux density : @xmath89 .",
    "an sis lens produces total magnifications described by the probability distribution @xmath90 ; so if @xmath91 , @xmath92 .",
    "the cross sections of all sis lenses are enhanced by this factor .",
    "the situation is more complicated for the nfw profile as its lensing properties depend on @xmath93 , which in turn depends on the halo mass and the angular distances to the halo and the source .",
    "we compute numerically the magnifications produced by nfw halos for @xmath94 and use this to tabulate @xmath95 .    for the sources in the jvas",
    "/ class survey , the redshift distribution is still poorly understood but the mean redshift is estimated to be @xmath96 ( marlow et al .",
    "2000 ) . since the lower flux source distribution of the jvas / class survey is indistinguishable from the complete , brighter source distribution of the caltech - jodrell bank vlbi sample ( henstock et al .",
    "1997 ) , we assume the latter quasar distribution for @xmath34 in eq .",
    "fig .  1 compares the jvas / class data with the predicted lensing probabilities @xmath97 calculated from eq .",
    "( 1 ) for the @xmath46 model and models with @xmath98 .",
    "the probability at @xmath3 decreases rapidly as @xmath0 increases towards 0 .",
    "the most important systematics that affect wide separation lensing are due to the halo concentration parameter @xmath99 . in fig .",
    "2a we quantify the dependence of @xmath100 on both @xmath0 and the coefficient of @xmath99 , @xmath101 .",
    "it shows that models with larger @xmath0 can tolerate a higher halo concentration due to the lower lensing rates in these models .",
    "jvas / class thus far has detected no lens systems with @xmath102 ( phillips et al.2000 ) .",
    "this excludes the highly concentrated halos in @xmath4 models as indicated by the @xmath103 , 90% , and 95% confidence contours in fig .",
    "we also plot the @xmath103 confidence levels that would be imposed if one wide separation lens system were discovered .",
    "we interpret the result as indicating that higher large separation lensing rates would lead to more refined constraints in the @xmath104 plane .",
    "we can also compare the total number of lenses predicted by the models with the 18 systems found among @xmath105 sources in jvas / class .",
    "we find the expected number of lenses with @xmath106 ( the approximate angular resolution of jvas / class ) to be @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 for the @xmath46 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 models shown in fig .  1 , respectively . because the sis lensing cross section is several orders of magnitude higher than that of the nfw , the expected number of lenses is not sensitive to the concentration @xmath114 . instead , it depends more strongly on the cooling mass @xmath77 because a larger @xmath77 allows more halos to be modeled as sis . in fig .",
    "2b we quantify the dependence of the total lensing rate on @xmath77 and @xmath0 by plotting the relative likelihood curves @xmath115 for detecting @xmath116 lenses from @xmath117 sources , where @xmath118 is the model - predicted lensing rate for a given @xmath0 .",
    "the range of @xmath77 is similar to that discussed in kochanek & white ( 2001 ) , with the upper and lower limits close to the cooling masses used by porciani & madau ( 2000 ) and li & ostriker ( 2001 ) .",
    "the @xmath119 confidence level in fig .",
    "2b suggests that the constraint on the equation of state is not sensitive to moderate alterations to the cooling mass .",
    "models with @xmath120 are disfavored in all three cases .",
    "note that our calculations implicitly assume that each halo below @xmath77 harbors sufficient baryons to give an sis profile for the _ total _ mass .",
    "it is likely , however , that lower mass halos be devoid of baryons and therefore retain a shallower profile ( e.g. , nfw ) . because an sis lens has a much larger cross section than an nfw lens of the same mass , modeling all low - mass halos as sis would overestimate the total lensing rate .",
    "constraints on @xmath0 derived under our assumptions are therefore conservative  if low - mass halos actually contribute smaller cross sections than our calculations predict , more negative @xmath0 would be needed to reproduce the observed lensing rate .",
    "both large separation lensing probabilities and the total predicted number of lenses are affected by the cosmological parameters @xmath20 and @xmath6 .",
    "our investigations show that varying these parameters within the @xmath103 error limits given in netterfield et al .",
    "( 2001 ) leads to almost parallel shifts in the contour lines and likelihood curves in fig .  2 by @xmath121 or less in @xmath0 , therefore not affecting the generality of our results .    as the figures show , the predicted lensing probability decreases as @xmath122 changes from @xmath9 towards 0",
    "the effect is particularly strong for lenses with @xmath3 , where the probability decreases by more than two orders of magnitude when @xmath0 is varied from @xmath9 to @xmath113 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath0 enters in two ways in our calculations : one through the mass power spectrum upon which the halo density @xmath49 depends ; the other through kinematic factors such as the angular diameter distances which are functions of @xmath0 . for the power spectrum ,",
    "different @xmath0 gives different linear growth rate for the density field .",
    "specifically , for a fixed @xmath6 and @xmath123 , the growth becomes slower as @xmath0 increases towards zero because the energy density in quintessence - type of fields dominates over that in matter at earlier times , resulting in earlier cessation of the gravitational collapse ( ma et al .",
    "the amplitude of the cobe - normalized power spectrum is generally lower for larger @xmath0 , resulting in a smaller halo density and hence a lower lensing probability .",
    "besides the power spectrum , the dependence of the lensing probabilities on @xmath0 also enters through the effective lensing volume element @xmath124 , where the first factor comes from the lensing cross section @xmath51 and the second factor is the distance to the lens in eq .",
    "these effects are illustrated in fig .",
    "it is interesting to compare gravitational lensing studied in this _ letter _ with classical cosmological tests for constraining the equation of state .",
    "ongoing efforts such as high redshift supernova searches and deep galaxy surveys offer promising ways to constrain @xmath0 by determining the luminosity distance @xmath125 and the cosmological volume element @xmath126 ( e.g. , newman & davis 2000 ; turner 2001 ) . in fig .",
    "3 we compare the luminosity distance and the volume element with the probability @xmath100 for large separation lensing . as we can see",
    ", @xmath100 depends more strongly on @xmath0 than the other quantities .",
    "gravitational lensing statistics from ongoing and future surveys with @xmath127 sources ( e.g. , the sdss ; see cooray & huterer 1999 ) may offer an independent probe of @xmath0 , provided that systematics associated with input source redshift distributions and halo concentration parameters can be minimized .",
