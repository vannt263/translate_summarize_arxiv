    "the colours and absolute magnitudes of the sun in various passbands are a natural calibration point for a wide range of stellar , galactic and extra - galactic astronomy .",
    "the sun is the closest star , with the best known , directly measured physical parameters ( luminosity , mass , age , radius , chemical composition ) .",
    "it is the first test - bench for calibrating models of stellar structure , and all quantities in stellar physics ( of special interest here , the luminosities ) are to be scaled to the solar values .",
    "also when studying more complex systems , such as external galaxies , one needs the solar magnitudes to translate the observed integrated magnitudes and colours into physical luminosities , so as to interpret them with theoretical population synthesis models . in an on - going study ( holmberg , portinari and flynn , in preparation ) we are determining the surface brightness of the local galactic disc in bands from the uv to the near ir , motivated by having a good description of the mass density of its stellar content ( holmberg & flynn 2000 , 2004 ) , and we ultimately aim at estimating the mass  to  light ratio of the local disc , for comparison to external galaxies , to the tully  fisher relation and to models of the chemical and photometric evolution of disc galaxies .",
    "this study motivated us to investigate more closely the present status of the solar magnitudes and colours in the various bands , needed to link between surface brightness and mass  to  light ratio .",
    "the sun is such a bright , non - point - like source that measuring its colours in the passbands adopted for astronomical work is no easy task , as the photometric devices used for observing other stars can not be applied to the sun .",
    "one way to circumvent the problem is to use the solar spectrum ( theoretical or observed ) and convolve it with the known filter responses to derive the solar magnitudes in the various photometric systems .",
    "an alternative solution is to search in the sky for ` sun  like ' stars , which have very similar properties to the sun and from them infer the solar values .",
    "the study of sun  like stars was pioneered by hardrop ( 1978 ) , with many more contributions in the 80 s and 90 s extensively reviewed by cayrel de strobel ( 1996 ) ; following her , we can distinguish :    * sun  like stars : f - g stars with colours ( @xmath2 , typically ) similar to those of the sun ; * solar analogues : stars with the same spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the sun , i.e.  basically stars with the same metallicity and effective temperature ( @xmath1 ) ; * solar twins : stars with all the physical parameters ( mass , age , chemical composition , @xmath1 , surface gravity etc . )",
    " identical \" to those of the sun .",
    "the closest `` solar twin '' found so far is hr 6060 ( porto de mello & da silva , 1997 ) , with @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "very recently , king , boesgaard & schuler ( 2005 ) have suggested that hip 78399 ( @xmath5 ) could be another candidate .",
    "solar twins are ideal to define the photometry of the sun , but due to their paucity , in practice one resorts to studying solar analogues more in general .    the most studied by far , yet elusive , of the solar colours is @xmath2 : the reddish values of 0.660.69 popular in the 70 s and 80 s are presently ruled out , as all recent estimates agree on 0.620.65 ( cayrel de strobel 1996 ; sekiguchi & fukugita 2000 ; soubiran & triaud 2004 ; ramrez & melndez 2005b ) . within this presently accepted range , studies pre - selecting the solar analogues , for instance by spectroscopy , favour @xmath6 ( e.g.  porto de mello & da silva 1997 ; soubiran & triaud 2004 ) , while interpolation within more general @xmath7colour[fe / h ] relations for sun - like stars tends to yield a bluer @xmath8 ( sekiguchi & fukugita 2000 ; ramrez & melndez 2005b ) .",
    "the latter result also implies that the solar @xmath2 predicted by theoretical model atmospheres : @xmath9 ( bessell , castelli & plez 1998 ; casagrande et  al .",
    "2005 , in prep . )",
    "is too red .",
    "sekiguchi & fukugita ascribe the discrepancy to systematics in the @xmath1 scale , i.e.  spectroscopic vs.infrared flux method ( irfm )  though within their quoted uncertainty @xmath10 , values @xmath110.64 remain plausible .",
    "we here analyse ` sun - like stars ' , chosen in a range of effective temperatures which brackets the effective temperature of the sun .",
    "the colours of the stars , in a number of passbands , are fitted for dependence on @xmath1 and metallicity [ fe / h ] . the sun s colours are then indirectly determined from these relations for adopted solar values of @xmath12  k and [ fe / h ] @xmath13 .",
    "crucial to this procedure is that the effective temperatures of the stars and the sun are on the same scale ; historically , this has been the basic impasse to estimating the solar colours indirectly from sun - like stars . during the last two years",
    ", this situation has fundamentally altered , as interferometric measurements of stellar diameters have started to become routine at such instruments as the eso vlti ( european southern observatory s very large telescope interferometer ) , pti ( palomar testbed interferometer ) and npoi ( navy prototype optical interferometer ) .",
    "these instruments have produced high accuracy stellar diameters for about 20 main sequence stars from @xmath14  to @xmath15  ( kervella et al .",
    "2004 ) . as a consequence",
    ", the effective temperatures of the stars can be determined in the same manner as for the sun , from the physical definition of @xmath1 , in terms of the bolometric luminosity at the earth , @xmath16 , and the angular diameter , @xmath17 , via    f_bol = t_eff^4    where @xmath18 is the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "using 13 stars with directly measured stellar diameters and bolometric fluxes , ramrez & melndez ( 2005a ) have determined direct effective temperatures , @xmath19 .",
    "they show that the widely used irfm temperature scale ( alonso , arribas & martnez - roger 1996 ) is a very good match to @xmath19 , but also derive an improved version of alonso et al s irfm temperature scale , showing that the systematic difference between the irfm and the directly measured temperature scales is not significantly different from zero ( formally , they obtain a difference of 18 k , with a dispersion around the mean of 62 k , and an error in the mean of 21 k for their 10 highest quality stars , in the sense that the irfm scale is the hotter one ) . in ramrez and melndez ( 2005b )",
    ", the authors derive a number of colour - temperature relations for main sequence stars ( and giants ) , from which estimates of the sun s colours are presented in a range of photometric systems .",
    "we became aware of this study while undertaking our own , and eventually made use of their extended set of irfm temperatures in order to supplement material we had collected , as described in detail below .",
    "our method is to fit the colours of sun - like stars as a function of their @xmath20 and metallicities from nordstrm et al ( 2004 ) , and then use these fits to solve for the colours of the sun , for which we adopt @xmath21 k and [ fe / h ] @xmath22 .",
    "stars similar to the sun have been selected from the sample of ramrez and melndez ( 2005a ) in the range @xmath23 , in order to bracket the solar effective temperature @xmath21  k , resulting in 115 main sequence stars . for 67 of these , accurate metallicities on a homogeneous system are taken from nordstrm et al s ( 2004 ) study of the kinematics and chemistry of some 14000 nearby f , g and k stars .",
    "the photometric metallicities of nordstrm et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have been shown to be in excellent agreement with spectroscopic ones . when compared to e.g. edvardsson et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , the total dispersion between photometric and spectroscopic [ fe / h ] is 0.08 dex . from this sample",
    "we select stars with a metallicity bracketing the solar one , in the range @xmath24 [ fe / h ] @xmath25 + 0.40 resulting in 52 stars which form our basic sample of main sequence , sun - like stars .",
    "their distribution in @xmath1 and [ fe / h ] is shown in figure [ tefeh ] .",
    "we collect from the literature wide - band johnson @xmath26 , cousins @xmath27 , two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) @xmath28 , tycho @xmath29 , @xmath30 and medium - band strmgren @xmath31 photometry for our sample stars , so as to determine indirectly the solar colours from the ultraviolet to the infrared . for 9 stars of the basic sample ,",
    "homogeneously measured @xmath32 photometry is available from bessell ( 1990 )  these are used to interpolate the solar colours involving @xmath32 filters . for 12 stars ,",
    "@xmath26 photometry is taken from johnson et al.(1966 )  these are used to infer the solar @xmath33 colour . for 31 stars ,",
    "@xmath28 data have been collected from the 2mass survey . finally , for 52 stars , strmgren photometry is available from nordstrm et al ( 2004 ) and tycho photometry from esa ( 1997 ) .    for each colour , the effective temperatures of the stars are fit to a linear ( first order ) function of colour and [ fe / h ] ( we also tried second order fits , but these were not significant improvements on linear fitting ) ; in practice , it was convenient to fit @xmath34 rather than @xmath1 directly .",
    "for example , for @xmath2 , we fitted for @xmath35 in the relation    _ eff = a_0 + a_1 ( b - v ) + a_2 .",
    "the reason we fit for @xmath36 as a function of colour and metallicity , is because the relative errors in colour and [ fe / h ] are always much smaller than the relative error in @xmath36 .",
    "figure [ tefit ] shows the result of the fit .",
    "the relations obtained can then be used to solve for the solar colours ( e.g. @xmath37 ) , under the assumption of @xmath38 k and [ fe / h]@xmath39 .",
    "formally , we have converted the relation to the form ( e.g. for @xmath2 )    b - v = b_0 + b_1 ( 5040/ ) + b_2 [ feq ]    in order to make clearer the effect of temperature and metallicity on derived colours .",
    "examination of column 4 in table [ fits ] , for example , shows that the effect of metallicity in the colour transformations decreases toward redder colour bands , and reverses its sign in the ir , as one would expect .",
    "the parameters for each of the fitted colours @xmath40 are shown in table  [ fits ] , and the solar colours derived are shown in table  [ solcol ] .",
    "we have carefully propagated the errors in fitting in order to obtain 1-@xmath18 error estimates on the derived solar colours .",
    "the error quoted in table  [ solcol ] for each colour is the total dispersion of the fit .",
    "in addition to the direct tycho @xmath41 colour shown in table  [ solcol ] , we also give the resulting johnson colour derived adopting the full transformation used for the @xmath2 values given in esa ( 1997 ) .",
    "the result is closely consistent with the proper johnson @xmath2 fit .",
    "we estimate the size of the systematic error as follows : the irfm temperature scale is now known to be consistent with the stellar interferometry based temperature scale to within 18  k ( dispersion 62 k , standard error 20 k ; ramrez & melndez 2005a ) .",
    "this result is consistent with zero offset , but also with a systematic offset of order 20 k. an offset of order 20 k produces systematic shifts in our derived colours of less than half the internal error ; had we included this potential systematic error ( in quadrature ) , our error estimates in table [ solcol ] would increase by 10% or less for all colours .",
    "interestingly , there are many more stars with accurate effective temperatures and metallicities for which photometry is available in the ir and strmgren colours , than in @xmath42  since the stars are so bright ( and we presently only have about a dozen stars in the sample ) we are planning to extend the @xmath42 sample with observations at the 30 cm telescope on la palma .",
    "when we tried to extend our study to _ ugriz _ photometry in a similar way as for the other colours , we found that there is almost no overlap between sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) standard stars and stars with either irfm @xmath1 or [ fe / h ] measured .",
    "hopefully this unfortunate situation will soon be remedied , but in the meantime we apply a secondary method to obtain the solar colours in the sdss bands .",
    "we have used the observationally based transformations between sdss and johnson  cousins photometry from smith et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , karaali , bilir , & tunel ( 2005 ) and bilir , karaali & tunel ( 2005 ) . to give an estimate of the present uncertainty of the transformations",
    ", we have added the dispersion between them to the propagated dispersion from the fit giving the total number shown in table  [ solcol ] .",
    ".parameters for the fitted relations ( see eqn [ feq ] ) for each indicated colour .",
    "the number of stars in the fits is shown in the last column . [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ solcol ]",
    "we have derived colour estimates for the sun from sun - like stars , taking advantage of the fact that the adopted stellar effective temperature scale from the irfm has been recently confirmed as both accurate and precise from interferometric measurements of stellar diameters ( ramrez & melndez 2005a ) .",
    "this is the primary reason for confidence in deriving solar colours from sun - like stars , but we have also restricted ourselves to the highest quality metallicity and colour data as well .",
    "while undertaking this study , we found that solar colours had been derived in a similar manner by ramrez & melndez ( 2005b ) .",
    "they derived broad and medium band colours : johnson / cousins , vilnius , strmgren @xmath43 , ddo , 2mass and tycho photometric systems , as part of a study primarily devoted to the effective temperature scale of f , g and k stars .",
    "we believe we have improved on their results by ( 1 ) severely restricting the stellar sample to the highest quality metallicities ; ( 2 ) providing error estimates on the quoted colours and ( 3 ) we concentrate on sun  like stars in the ( @xmath1 , [ fe / h ] ) region closest to the sun , rather than interpolating the solar colours from fitting relations valid for a much wider range in temperatures and metallicities .",
    "combined with the requirement of highest quality metallicity data , this restricts our sample to a rather small number of stars ( especially in @xmath42 ) , which we plan to extend in the near future .",
    "however we remark that our sample is not significantly smaller than that of ramrez & melndez , _ once the same restrictions in @xmath7 is applied_. as mentioned in section 2 , the requirement of good metallicity data reduces their sample by 40% ( from 115 to 67 stars ) , and their subsamples with available bvri photometry would count 1137 stars vs.  our 912 stars in table  [ fits ] .",
    "the lower number of stars in our sample is compensated for by the increased accuracy and homogeneity in the metallicities , the smaller number of parameters and the decreased dispersion in the fits for this restricted temperature range ( see below ) .",
    "notice also that , for @xmath2 , our direct determination based on just 9 objects is in excellent agreement with the indirect determination from tycho @xmath41 colours , which is based on 51 objects .",
    "actually , all our colours were found to be , within our error estimates , in excellent agreement with ramrez & melndez , with the possible exception of @xmath2 .",
    "for this colour , we find @xmath44 , while ramrez & melndez find @xmath45 ( no error given ) .",
    "we have attempted to reconstruct the size of their error , and believe it to be about twice our own error , or about 0.03 mag .",
    "this is based on their estimate of a scatter in the ( 10 parameter ) fit of effective temperature to colour and metallicity of 88 k for main sequence stars ( their table 2 ) , whereas our own ( 3 parameter ) fit produces a scatter of 43  k. our reconstruction of the size of their error appears to be correct ( ramrez 2005 , priv .",
    "comm . ) , hence the two estimates of @xmath37 agree within the errors .",
    "sekiguchi & fukugita ( 2000 ) have also studied the @xmath2 colour  temperature relation , using a very similar method , and deriving @xmath46 .",
    "our solar colours are also in good agreement with cayrel de strobel ( 1996 ) : @xmath47 , @xmath48 ; gray ( 1995 ) : @xmath49 , @xmath50 ; taylor ( 1998 ) : @xmath51 .",
    "another method to determine the colours of the sun is by applying synthetic photometry to the observed , absolute flux calibrated solar spectrum ; this results in @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( colina , bohlin & castelli 1996 ; bessel et  al .",
    "1998 ) , again in good agreement with our determinations . finally , also the predictions of the most updated theoretical stellar atmosphere models : @xmath6 ( casagrande et  al .",
    "2005 , in prep . )",
    "are well compatible with our results .    in summary",
    ", we have provided an estimate of the colours of the sun in a large variety of photometric systems , by comparison to sun  like stars in the same temperature and metallicity range as the sun .",
    "we made use of the most accurate and internally homogeneous data available for colours and metallicity , and took advantage of the recently firmly - established direct and irfm temperature scale .",
    "we also give a careful estimate of the present uncertainties .",
    "within the errors , our solar colours are in excellent agreement with the analogous recent work by ramrez & melndez ( 2005b ) , with the possible exception of @xmath2 which remains somewhat controversial . while in the past",
    "the discrepancy was imputed to the temperature scale ( sekiguchi & fukugita 2000 ) , this is now no longer the issue .",
    "the main difference seems to be between studies deriving @xmath8 from fitting @xmath7colour relations from a wide range of temperatures and metallicities ( sekiguchi & fukugita 2000 ; ramrez & melndez 2005b ) , and on the other side studies focussing on solar analogues pre  selected spectroscopically or within a narrower range of solar  like temperatures ( cayrel de strobel 1996 ; gray 1995 ; soubiran & triaud 2004 ; present work ) which favour @xmath54 . increased accuracy in selecting good quality , homogeneous data has also some effect on our result .",
    "our @xmath55 is in close agreement with the colours of the closest solar twin known so far ( hr 6060 ) and of the new candidate hip 78399 .",
    "finally , once errors are properly taken into account , we remark that there is no crucial discrepancy between our result and the bluer colour of sekiguchi & fukugita , ramrez & melndez .",
    "the main limit presently is the small number of stars with good quality metallicity data , having suitable @xmath42 photometry .",
    "we plan to improve on this aspect with new observations in the near future .",
    "we thank luca casagrande for valuable advice on the irfm and on the theoretical solar colours ; and ivan ramrez for useful correspondence .",
