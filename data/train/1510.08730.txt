    "nuclear modification factors measured by alice in minimum bias ( mb )  collisions for charged particles  @xcite , heavy flavor and jets show no deviations from unity at high-@xmath0 , demonstrating that the observed strong suppression in  collisions is due to final state effects .",
    "however several measurements  @xcite of particle production in the low and intermediate @xmath0  region can not be explained by an incoherent superposition of pp  collisions , but rather call for coherent and collective effects . as their strength increases with multiplicity , a more detailed characterisation of the collision geometry is needed . moreover , a knowledge of the geometry dependence is necessary to interpret the suppression pattern of charmonia ( j/@xmath1 @xmath1(2s ) ) and in  collisions relative to the effects observed in the nuclear medium produced in  collisions .",
    "alice has carried out detailed studies of the centrality determination in  collisions , and the possible biases induced by the event selection on the scaling of hard processes in a selected event sample .",
    "the centrality determination consists in relating a glauber model , which calculates the geometric properties of the event ( @xmath2 ) , to a measured observable related to the event activity in a specific rapidity region  @xcite , via the conditional probability to observe a certain activity for a given @xmath2 .",
    "more specifically , particle production measured by detectors at mid - rapidity can be modeled with a negative binomial distribution ( nbd ) .",
    "the zero - degree energy is related to the number of the slow nucleons emitted in the nucleus fragmentation process , which we model with a slow nucleon model ( snm )  @xcite .",
    "fits of both models to our data are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : glaunernbdsnm ] .         however , the connection of the measurement to the collision geometry has to be validated , eg by correlating observables from kinematic regions causally disconnected after the collision , or by comparing a glauber mc with data for a known process , as eg the deuteron dissociation probability at rhic  @xcite .",
    "in addition the consistency of the approach must be demonstrated . as in general the selection in a system with large relative fluctuations",
    "can induce a bias , one needs to identify the physics origin of the bias in order to correct centrality dependent measurements . in  collisions ,",
    "the relative large size of the multiplicity fluctuations has the consequence that a centrality selection based on multiplicity may select a biased sample of nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "in essence , by selecting high ( low ) multiplicity one chooses not only large ( small ) average @xmath3 but also positive ( negative ) multiplicity fluctuations per nucleon - nucleon collision .",
    "this is shown on the left in fig .",
    "[ fig : multdist ] . these fluctuations",
    "are partly related to qualitatively different types of collisions , described in all recent monte carlo generators by impact parameter dependence of the number of particle sources via multi - parton interaction . hence , the biases on the multiplicity discussed above correspond to a bias on the number of hard scatterings ( @xmath4 ) . as a consequence , for peripheral ( central ) collisions",
    "we expect a lower ( higher ) than average number of hard scatterings per binary collision , corresponding to a nuclear modification factor less than one ( greater than one ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : multdist ] , right .",
    "however also other types of biases have an influence on the nuclear modification factor : the jet - veto effect , due to the trivial correlation between the centrality estimator and the presence of a high-@xmath0  particles originating from jets in the event ; the geometric bias , resulting from the mean impact parameter between nucleons rising for the most peripheral events @xcite .     from the nbd - glauber mc in  and  calculations .",

    "the alice approach aims to a centrality selection with minimal bias and , therefore , uses the signal in the zero degree calorimeter ( zna ) . in this case",

    "fig.[fig : hybrid ] indicate a monotonic change of the scaling with rapidity .",
    "the correlation between the zdc energy and any variable in the central part shows unambiguously the connection of these observables to geometry .    exploiting the findings from the correlation analysis described , we make use of observables that are expected to scale as a linear function of @xmath2  or @xmath3 , to calculate @xmath2 :    * @xmath6 : the multiplicity at mid - rapidity proportional to the @xmath3 ; * @xmath7 : the target - going multiplicity proportional to @xmath8 ; * @xmath9 : the yield of high-@xmath0  particles at mid - rapidity is proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "these scalings are used as an ansatz , in the alice socalled _ hybrid method _ to calculate @xmath2 , rescaling the mb value @xmath10 by the ratio of the normalized signals to the mb one .",
    "we therefore obtain 3 sets of values of @xmath2 .",

    "[ fig : convolution],scaledwidth=100.0% ]    the @xmath2  distributions for centrality classes selected with zna , obtained from the snm - glauber fit , are convolved with the nbd from the fit to the v0a distribution .",

    "moreover , a good agreement is also achieved with an unfolding procedure , where the @xmath2  distributions have been fitted to the data using the parameters from the nbd - glauber fit . for each v0a distribution selected by zna",
    ", we find the @xmath2  distribution that , convolved with the @xmath11 , fits the data , i.e. the parameters of the fit are the relative contributions of each @xmath2  bin .",
    "the existence of @xmath2  distributions that folded with nbd agree with measured signal distributions is a necessary condition for zna to behave as an unbiased centrality selection .",
    "this procedure , which actually does not work for a biased centrality selection ( eg cl1 ) shows that the energy measured by zn is connected to the collision geometry .",
    "the nuclear modification factors @xmath12  calculated with multiplicity based estimator ( shown in fig.[fig : qpahybrid ] for cl1 , where centrality is based on the tracklets measured in @xmath13 ) widely spreads between centrality classes .",
    "they also exhibit a negative slope in @xmath0 , mostly in peripheral events , due to the jet veto bias , as jet contribution to particle production increases with @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath12  compared to g - pythia , a toy mc which couples pythia to a p - pb glauber mc , show a good agreement , everywhere in 80 - 100% , and in general at high-@xmath0 , demonstrating that the proper scaling for high-@xmath0  particle production is an incoherent superposition of pp  collisions , provided that the bias introduced by the centrality selection is properly taken into account , as eg in g - pythia .    with the hybrid method , using either the assumption on mid - rapidity multiplicity proportional to @xmath3 , or forward multiplicity proportional to @xmath8 , the @xmath12  shown in fig .",

    "the observed cronin enhancement is stronger in central collisions and nearly absent in peripheral collisions .",

    "[ fig : qpahybrid],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=46.0% ]      charged particle density is also studied as a function of @xmath5 , for different centrality classes , with different estimators . in peripheral collisions",
    "the shape of the distribution is almost fully symmetric and resembles what is seen in proton - proton collisions , while in central collisions it becomes progressively more asymmetric , with an increasing excess of particles produced in the direction of the pb beam .",
    "we have quantified the evolution plotting the asymmetry between the proton and lead peak regions , as a function of the yield around the midrapidity ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dndetanpart2 ] , left ) : the increase of the asymmetry is different for the different estimators .",

    "this trend is absent when @xmath3  is calculated with the glauber - gribov model , which shows a relatively constant behavior , with the exception of the most peripheral point . for zna",
    ", there is a clear sign of saturation above @xmath3  = 10 , due to the saturation of forward neutron emission .",
    "none of these curves points towards the pp  data point .",
    "in contrast , the results obtained with the hybrid method , using either @xmath8-scaling at forward rapidity or @xmath2-scaling for high-@xmath0  particles give very similar trends , and show a nearly perfect scaling with @xmath3 , which naturally reaches the pp  point .",
    "this indicates the sensitivity of the @xmath3-scaling behavior to the glauber modeling , and the importance of the fluctuations of the nucleon - nucleon collisions themselves .    for various centrality estimators .",

    "when using them to calculate centrality - dependent @xmath12 , one must include the full dynamical bias .",
    "however , using the centrality from the zna estimator and our assumptions on particle scaling , an approximate independence of the multiplicity measured at mid - rapitity on the number of participating nucleons is observed .",
