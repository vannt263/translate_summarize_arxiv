    "quantum physics has opened new ways in information theory .",
    "quantum computing and quantum information processing have attracted great attention in last few decades both in the theoretical and experimental domain @xcite .",
    "quantum gates , the devices analogous to classical logical gates , are necessary ingredients for building quantum circuits .",
    "considerable effort was devoted to implement them experimentally on several physical platforms that represent good candidates for this tasks @xcite .",
    "one of them is linear optics .",
    "the advantage of linear - optical quantum gates is that they are accessible by a present - day technology , their realization is relatively simple @xcite , there is a chance of their integration @xcite , and they work directly with light so they are convenient for information - processing tasks connected with quantum communication @xcite .",
    "the disadvantage is that they are mostly probabilistic , i.e. they operate with the success probability lower than one .",
    "this problem can be overcome by more complex setups based on pre - arranged entangled states @xcite .",
    "however , even the basic linear - optical quantum gates with success probability lower than one can be quite useful for small scale applications of quantum information processing . especially for the circuits behind or between quantum links because in real - life quantum channels huge losses must be tolerated anyway .",
    "it is an interesting question how to quantify the performance of quantum gates .",
    "it was proposed to use the so called _ entangling power _ @xcite .",
    "this measure is defined either as an average or maximal value of measures of entanglement of the output states over all separable input states .",
    "of course , quantum gates are not primarily intended as entanglement sources ( the sources of entangled states can be implemented more easily @xcite ) but their capability to create entanglement from separable input states is crucial for quantum information processing .",
    "thus entangling power is a good measure of non - classicality of quantum gates .",
    "however , this measure is disputable in the case of probabilistic quantum gates .",
    "one can consider two distinct cases : ( i ) a deterministic device which prepares entangled states with low amount of entanglement and ( ii ) a probabilistic device which generates highly entangled states but which fails sometimes .",
    "what is better ?",
    "we can imagine we have a perfect entanglement - distillation apparatus which we apply to the output of the first device ( i ) .",
    "we use it to obtain ( asymptotically ) such a number of distilled states which equals to the number of states generated by the second device ( ii ) .",
    "the number of input states is assumed to be the same for both devices .",
    "now , having the same fraction of states per a gate operation , we can find which of the two cases ( i or ii ) leads to a higher amount of entanglement .",
    "thus a good measure of performance of probabilistic quantum gates could be the product of distillable entanglement @xcite and success probability maximized over all separable input states .",
    "but there are two problems with this definition .",
    "the first one is practical : it is difficult to calculate distillable entanglement for a general state .",
    "the second one is conceptual : this definition fails to quantify the ability to generate bound entangled states .",
    "therefore it is convenient to generalize the definition of this quantity as the maximum ( over all separable input states ) of the product of success probability and any well - behaved entanglement measure chosen according to one s particular needs .",
    "we will call this function _ entangling efficiency_. it is reasonable to choose an entanglement measure which is convex because then the maximum can be taken only over all pure product input states .    in the following text we will define particular form of entangling efficiency using negativity as the measure of entanglement and we will use it to characterize the optimal linear - optical controlled phase gate recently implemented in our laboratory .",
    "in this paper we will measure the amount of entanglement in a quantum state by its negativity .",
    "negativity of state @xmath0 is defined as @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the trace norm and @xmath3 means the partial transpose .",
    "this measure can be easily calculated .",
    "it is convex , @xmath4 , and it is an entanglement monotone ( does not change under local operation and classical communication ) .",
    "however , it is zero even if the state is entangled under positive partial transpose .    entangling power",
    "is defined as the supremum of negativity of output states over all separable input states : @xmath5 ) \\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath6 $ ] denotes the output state of the device corresponding to input state @xmath0 ( @xmath7 is a completely positive map ) and @xmath8 is the set of all separable input states .",
    "convexity of negativity is important , because for a non - convex entanglement measure there might be a mixed state whose measure of entanglement is greater than the negativity of any of the pure states it is composed of .",
    "this fact would complicate the search for the input state corresponding to the maximum because mixed states have significantly more degrees of freedom than pure states .",
    "we define entangling efficiency in the following way : @xmath9 ) \\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the success probability of the gate for a given input state @xmath0 .",
    "we illustrate the concept of entangling efficiency on an intuitive case of a beam splitter followed by a post - selection .",
    "let us begin with a balanced beam splitter with transmittance @xmath11 and reflectance @xmath12 both equal to @xmath13 .",
    "two photonic qubits are initially in separable states and each of them enters one input port of the beam splitter .",
    "subsequently we perform a post - selection taking into account only the cases where there is exactly one photon in each output mode .",
    "let us express a separable input state , @xmath14 , using the following parametrization ( without the loss of generality one part of the input state can be fixed ) : @xmath15 represents an arbitrary orthogonal basis .",
    "simple algebra reveals that the success probability of the above described beam - splitter transformation reads @xmath16 using definition ( [ eq : def : neg ] ) one can calculate negativity of output states @xmath17 which is independent of the input state .",
    "therefore the entangling power of the beam splitter reads : @xmath18 as for the entangling efficiency , one has to find the maximum of the product of success probability and negativity @xmath19 this product is maximized for @xmath20 so the entangling efficiency is @xmath21     ( full line ) , negativity @xmath22 ( dotted line ) and their product ( dashed line ) as functions of angle @xmath23 parametrizing the input separable state . ]    fig .",

    "[ fig : bs_t ] presents these three properties of the beam splitter as functions of its transmittance .",
    "we further demonstrate our concept of entangling power on the second example : the optimal linear - optical controlled - phase ( c - phase ) gate .",
    "a controlled phase gate implements the following operation on two qubits : @xmath28 in general , it is an entangling quantum gate .",
    "together with single - qubit operations , it forms a universal set for quantum computing .",
    "e.g. , the controlled - not gate can be obtained by applying a hadamard transform to the target qubit before and after the controlled - phase gate with phase shift @xmath29 .",

    "[ scheme1 ] .",

    "the gate is optimal in the sense that for any phase shift it operates at the maximum possible success probability that is achievable within the framework of any post - selected linear - optical implementation without auxiliary photons .",

    "for any given value of gate phase shift @xmath30 , it is maximized for @xmath39 ( equal superposition of computational basis states ) . the maximum negativity and therefore the entangling power for a given phase @xmath30 thus reads @xmath40 similarly , the entangling efficiency can be obtained by maximizing the product @xmath41 over the input - state parameters @xmath42 .",
    "because the success probability does not depend on the input state , we obtain the entangling efficiency as a function of the gate phase shift , @xmath30 , in the form @xmath43 clearly , the success probability of our c - phase gate is state independent [ see eq .",
    "( [ eqnn : psucc ] ) ] , so entangling efficiency of the gate is just a product of success probability and entangling power .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : gate_state ] there are plots of success probability @xmath24 , negativity @xmath22 , and their product in dependence on parameter @xmath32 for @xmath33 and @xmath44 ( this parameter is kept fixed and equal to its optimal value ) .",
    "[ fig : gate ] shows success probability @xmath24 , entangling power @xmath25 , and entangling efficiency @xmath27 as functions of @xmath30 .",
    "because of the high importance of the c - phase gate for quantum computation , we have tested its entangling power and efficiency also experimentally . to calculate entangling power and efficiency from experimental data we scanned the four - parametric space of all separable input states numerically ( over @xmath45",
