    "the existence of an initial singularity is one of the major drawbacks of classical cosmology . in spite of the fact that the standard cosmological model , based in the classical general relativity theory , has been successfully tested until the nucleosynthesis era ( around @xmath0 )",
    ", the extrapolation of this model to higher energies leads to a breakdown of the geometry in a finite cosmic time .",
    "this breakdown of the geometry may indicate that the classical theory must be replaced by a quantum theory of gravitation : quantum effects may avoid the presence of the singularity , leading to a complete regular cosmological model .",
    "the quantization of gravity is plagued with many conceptual and technical problems , and when it is applied to the whole universe new issues appear . in the dirac quantization approach , a functional equation for the wave function of the universe",
    "is obtained , the wheeler - dewitt equation @xcite , which is the basic equation of quantum cosmology .",
    "it is formulated in the so - called superspace , the space of all possible three - dimensional spatial geometries .",
    "it is very hard to find exact solutions of the full wheeler - dewitt equation , but solutions may be found in minisuperspaces where all but a finite number of degrees of freedom are frozen .    among the fundamental questions that come from the quantization of the universe as a whole , one of the most important concerns the interpretation of the wave function coming from the wheeler - dewitt equation . in order to extract predictions from the wave function of the universe , the bohm - de broglie ontological interpretation of quantum mechanics @xcite has been proposed @xcite , since it avoids many conceptual difficulties that follow from the application of the standard copenhagen interpretation to an unique system that contains everything . in opposition to the latter one , the ontological interpretation does not need a classical domain outside the quantized system to generate the physical facts out of potentialities ( the facts are there _ ab initio _ ) , and hence it can be applied to the universe as a whole.with this interpretation in hands , one can ask if the quantum scenario predicted by the wheeler - dewitt equation is free of singularities and which type of classical universe emerges from the quantum phase .    in a preceding work @xcite ,",
    "we have applied this proposal to a free scalar - tensor model with minimal coupling in friedmann - robertson - walker geometry , which can be obtained from a non - minimal scalar - tensor theory through a conformal transformation .",
    "free scalar fields are good candidates to describe the material content of the early universe because of their simplicity and because they represent stiff matter , the type of fluid advocated by zeldovich @xcite to be relevant at early stages of cosmic evolution .",
    "only positive curvature spatial sections have been studied .",
    "the bohmian trajectories in configuration space revealed an unexpected scenario : they behaved as the classical solutions for small values of the scale factor , but display quantum behaviour when the scale factor is big .",
    "as a consequence , the initial singularity is still present in this quantum model .",
    "the wheeler - dewitt solutions for this scalar - tensor model contain positive and negative frequency modes , the first leading to an expanding universe , and the second to a contracting universe , near the singularity .",
    "inspired by this observation , we constructed in @xcite some particular superpositions mixing negative and positive models . in this way , we found non - singular quantum solutions which were , however , of planckian size and hence they could not be a model for our real universe .    the aim of the present work is to explore further the possibilities of the minisuperspace model of reference @xcite .",
    "first , we will not restrict ourselves to positive curvature spatial sections and second , we will explore more suitable superpositions of negative and positive modes , namely , the gaussian superposition .",
    "for the case the spatial section is flat , it is possible to solve analytically the expressions for the phase of the wave function , and to reduce the equations for the bohmian trajectories to a dynamical system .",
    "the critical points are calculated , and they are identified as center or nodes points .",
    "this leads to the existence of three kind of scenarios : periodic solutions representing oscillating universes ; bouncing universes ; models with a big - bang followed by a big - crunch .",
    "the bouncing universes contract classically from infinity until a minimum size , where quantum effects become important acting as repulsive forces avoiding the singularity , expanding afterwards to an infinite size , approaching the classical expansion as long as the scale factor increases .",
    "these are non - singular solutions which are viable models to describe the universe we live in . for closed and open spatial sections ,",
    "all calculations must be performed numerically , and the trajectories obtained in the configuration space reveal again the presence of oscillating universes besides those with a big - bang followed by a big - crunch . in all three cases ,",
    "the oscillating universes have a characteristic scale of the order of the planck length , except for very special gaussians in the case of zero saptial curvature .",
    "hence , the most interesting scenarios emerge from the flat case , where we have succeeded to obtain a viable non - singular model .    the article is organized as follows . in section 2 , we describe the classical model and the corresponding wheeler - dewitt equation in the minisuperspace .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the study of the gaussian superposition of the quantum solutions found before , and their corresponding analysis . in section 4",
    "we present our conclusions .",
    "let us take the lagrangian @xmath1 for @xmath2 we have effective string theory without the kalb - ramond field . for @xmath3",

    "the bohm - de broglie interpretation of homogeneous minisuperspace models goes as follows : in general , the minisuperspace wheeler - de witt equation is @xmath53 writing @xmath54 , and substituting it into ( [ bsc ] ) , we obtain the following equation : @xmath55 where the quantum potential is @xmath56    the bohm - de broglie interpretation applied to quantum cosmology states that the trajectories @xmath57 are real , independently of any observations .",
    "( [ hoqg ] ) is the hamilton - jacobi equation for them , which is the classical one amended with a quantum potential term ( [ hqgqp ] ) , responsible for the quantum effects .",
