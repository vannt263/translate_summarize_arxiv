    "+ however , for the simple case in hand , substituting @xmath115 in eqn .",
    "[ [ inhomosoln ] ] , followed by some algebra , it is easy to demonstrate that , @xmath129 .",
    "now using the same in the expression for phase velocity @xmath3 yields , @xmath130 using eqns .",
    "[ [ livas ] ] and [ [ livsn ] ] in eqn.[[vfot ] ] and considering the dispersion relation to zeroth order in @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath67 , we obtain , @xmath131 \\label{phvel}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the expression for phase velocity , as given by eqn . [ [ phvel ] ] , provides an interesting limit for @xmath2 ; in order to have a real phase velocity , one must have @xmath132 .",
    "so in principle one can define an expansion parameter @xmath133 , and perform an all order expansion of @xmath134 , in powers of @xmath135 , for @xmath136 , and be convinced that the magnitude of @xmath3 stays less than @xmath137 , i.e. phase velocity is causal .",

    "of  course the problem of having complex @xmath7 is avoided by considering @xmath136 , however the issue of superluminality remains .",
    "we believe , that this is an artifact of the special background that violates lorentz and cpt invariance . the presence of this special background may be responsible for making @xmath7 of the @xmath18 state superluminal .      in fig.[[fig:1 ] ] , we have plotted @xmath7 and @xmath3 , for various values of @xmath2 . as can be seen from the plots , that as energy , @xmath144 the group ( phase ) velocity , @xmath145 . + the solution for @xmath16 , is similar to @xmath18 modulo a constant phase factor .",
    "it seems that , for @xmath146 , there is energy exchange between these two modes . a detailed understanding of the physics of energy transfer as well as how the system behaves",
    "once the back - reaction of the propagating modes on the background is taken into account , following [ @xcite and @xcite ] , seems to be an important issue .",
    "however addressing the same are beyond the aim and the scope of the current article and would not be dealt with any further here .",
    "+ * signature : * in astrophysical situations synchrotron or curvature radiation is the most common process of non - thermal emission . as is well known , from @xcite , that such radiations are always _ polarized _ along and orthogonal to the @xmath147 plane . where @xmath148 is the instantaneous velocity vector of the radiating charged particle .",
    "the synchrotron amplitudes of the electromagnetic radiation for these two polarized states are given by , @xmath149 in eqns .",
    "[ [ power ] ] , @xmath150 is the lorentz factor , @xmath151 is the cutoff frequency and @xmath152 is the radius of curvature of the trajectory of the radiating particle .",
    "lastly @xmath153 is the opening angle of the radiating cone .",
    "+ since for @xmath154 , the only evolving polarized state is @xmath155 when dimension-5 , @xmath156 interaction is present , therefore , to a far away observer , the synchrotron radiation would appear to be _ linearly _ polarized .",
    "+ so , the differential intensity spectrum per unit energy , per unit solid angle at the source for the @xmath48 state , following eqn.[[power ] ] , is given by : @xmath157 .",
    "further more , if all the astrophysical absorption mechanisms are negligible , then the magnitude of @xmath158 , at the source , as well as , at the observation point would remain the same . therefore , the differential intensity spectrum for two different energies @xmath159 , would be related to the respective energies , @xmath160 and @xmath161 by , @xmath162 ^ 2\\!\\!\\ !",

    "\\label{freqint}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is the _ intensity  energy _ relation . while deriving the same ( i.e. , eqn . [ [ freqint ] ] ) , we have used eqn.[[power ] ] and expanded @xmath163 in decending powers of @xmath164 . + next we would like to relate this _ intensity  energy _ relation ( eqn . [ [ freqint ] ] ) with _ the rotation measure_. + since the intervening media between the source and the far - away observer is magnetized and composed of nonrelativistic , degenerate electrons ; the plane of polarization ( pop ) of a polarized light ( of energy @xmath2 ) passing through the same would undergo faraday rotation ( fr ) , given by @xcite , @xmath165 here , @xmath166 is the angle between pop and @xmath167 at source and @xmath168 is the length of the path travelled .",
    "rest of the symbols in eqn .",
    "[ [ roa ] ] have their usual meaning .",
    "+ since the net rotation measure ( @xmath169 ) due to fr goes as @xmath170 ; therefore , for a multi - frequency plane polarized light beam , the ratio of the two _ rotation measures _ at two distinct energies ( @xmath171 and @xmath172 ) , will be given by the following relation , + @xmath173 eqn.[[freqpol ] ] may henceforth be termed as energy - dependent - rotation measure ( edrm ) .",
    "+ now we can use eqns .",
    "[ [ freqint ] ] and [ [ freqpol ] ] , to arrive at a relation between the rotation measure and the differential intensity spectrum , for @xmath80 (  i.e. , the solution for @xmath25 state ) , and the same is : @xmath174^{\\frac{3}{2}}. \\label{roai}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for magnetic field strength at source , @xmath175 gauss , and @xmath176 , we have @xmath177 which lies in the radio range .",
    "+ so , the polarization versus ( differential ) intensity distribution pattern , for plane polarized light , in the energy range , @xmath178 , from distant astrophysical objects ( with dominant synchrotron source ) , should behave according to eqns . [ [ freqint ] ] and [ [ roai ] ] .",
    "+ conversely , for @xmath2 above @xmath179 , both , @xmath180 and @xmath75 would propagate in space - time . and @xmath75 would undergo amplitude modulation because of mixing with @xmath76 .",
    "hence , the emerging light beam may bear some appropriate polarimetric @xcite and dispersive signatures of @xmath181 interaction , when the faraday and the mixing effects are considered together , provided , the same is realized in nature .",
    "+ similar signatures from different astrophysical radio sources were reported in @xcite and @xcite sometimes back .",
    "they may have some implications for the situation we have discussed in this note .",
    "however one should work with the new data sets before coming to a definite conclusion .",
