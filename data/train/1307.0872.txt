    "we consider a problem of utility maximization under uncertainty .",
    "the objective of the investor is to determine the optimal consumption - investment strategy when the model is not exactly known .",
    "such problem is known as the robust utility maximization and is formulated as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the @xmath2-expected utility .",
    "the investor has to solve a sup inf problem .",
    "he considers the worst scenario by minimizing over a set of probability measures and then he maximizes his utility . in the literature",
    "there are two approaches to solve the robust utility maximization problems .",
    "the first one relies on duality methods such as quenez @xcite or shied and wu @xcite .",
    "they considered a set of probability measures called priors and they minimized over this set .",
    "the second approach , which is followed in this paper , is based on the penalization method and the minimization is taken over all possible models such as in anderson , hansen and sargent @xcite .",
    "moreover skiadas @xcite followed the same point of view and he gave the dynamics of the control problem via bsde in the markovian context . in our case , the @xmath2-expected utility is the sum of a classical utility function and a penalization term based on a relative entropy . in bordigoni",
    "@xcite , they proved the existence of a unique @xmath3 optimal model which minimizes our cost function .",
    "they used the stochastic control techniques to study the dynamic value of the minimization problem . in the case of continuous filtration",
    ", they showed that the value function is the unique solution of a generalized bsde with a quadratic driver .",
    "+ in faidi , matoussi and mnif @xcite , they studied the maximization part of the problem in a complete market by using the bsde approach as in duffie and skiadas @xcite and el karoui et al .",
    "@xcite . + in our paper , we assume that the portfolio is constrained to take values in a given closed convex non - empty subset @xmath4 of @xmath5 .",
    "such problem was studied when the underlying model is known by karatzas , lehoczky , shreve and xu @xcite in the incomplete market case and then by cvitanic and karatzas @xcite for convex constraints on the portfolio .",
    "skiadas and schroder @xcite studied the lifetime consumption - portfolio recursive utility problem under convex trading constraints .",
    "they used the utility gradient approach .",
    "they derived a first order conditions of optimality which take the form of a constrained forward backward stochastic differential equation .",
    "wealth was computed in a recursion starting with a time - zero value forward in time , while utility was computed in a recursion starting with a terminal date value backward in time . in our context",
    ", we study the robust formulation of the consumption - investment utility problem under convex constraints on the portfolio . using change of measures and optional decomposition under constraints",
    ", we give a dual characterization of the admissible consumption investment strategy , then we state an existence result to the optimization problem where the criterion is the solution at time 0 of a quadratic bsde with unbounded terminal condition .",
    "to describe the structure of the solution , we use duality arguments .",
    "the heart of the dual approach in the classical setting , when the criterion is taken under the historical probability measure , is to find a saddle point for the lagrangian and apply a mini - max theorem in the infinite dimensional case .",
    "it is appropriate to use the conjugate function of @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in our case",
    ", the criterion is taken under the probability measure modeling the worst scenario and the conjugate function does not appear naturally .",
    "we use the duality arguments in a different way .",
    "we prove the existence of a probability measure under which the budget constraint is satisfied with equality .",
    "then , we derive a maximum principle which gives a necessary and sufficient conditions of optimality .",
    "thanks to this result , we give an implicit expression of the optimal terminal wealth and the optimal consumption rate . this later result is a generalization of cvitanic and karatzas @xcite work . + the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the model and the stochastic control problem .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the existence and the uniqueness of an optimal strategy . in section 4",
