    "quantum homodyne tomography ( qht ) is certainly the most successful technique for measuring the quantum state of radiation .",
    "it is based on homodyne detection , where the signal mode is amplified by the local oscillator .",
    "this means that there is no need for single - photon resolving photodetectors , whence it is possible to achieve quantum efficiency @xmath0 approaching the ideal unit value by using linear photodiodes @xcite . moreover , qht is efficient and statistically reliable , such that it can be used on - line with the experiment . indeed , among other proposed state reconstruction methods , qht is the only one which has been implemented in quantum optical experiments @xcite .",
    "possible applications of qht range from the measurement of photon correlations on a sub - picosecond time - scale @xcite to the characterization of squeezing properties @xcite , photon statistics in parametric fluorescence @xcite , quantum correlations in down - conversion @xcite and nonclassicality of states @xcite . in general , the key point is that qht provides information about the quantum state within a chosen sideband , thus allowing for a precise spectral characterization of the light beam under investigation .    in this paper we address qht as a tool for the quantum characterization of optical devices , like the estimation of the coupling constant of an active medium or the quantum efficiency of a photodetector . the goal is to link the estimation of such parameters with the results from feasible measurement schemes , as homodyne detection , and to make the estimation procedure the most efficient .",
    "we present our experimental results about the reconstruction of the quantum state of coherent signals , together with application to the estimation of the losses introduced by simple optical components .",
    "moreover , we show how these preliminary results can be extended to the characterization of more general optical devices .    in the next section we review some basic elements of quantum tomography , whereas in section [",
    "s : tool ] we describe the basic requirements needed to implement a quantum characterization tool based on tomographic measurements . in section [ s : exp ] the experimental apparatus is described with some details , and in section [ s : data ] the experimental data are analyzed and discussed .",
    "section [ s : outro ] closes the paper by discussing the possible extensions of the present work .",
    "quantum tomography of a single - mode radiation field consists of a set of repeated measurements of the field - quadrature @xmath1 at different values of the reference phase @xmath2 .",
    "the expectation value of a generic operator can be obtained by averaging a suitable kernel function @xmath3(x,\\phi)$ ] as follows @xcite @xmath4(x,\\phi)\\label{avprob}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 denotes the probability distribution of the outcomes @xmath6 for the quadrature @xmath7 , and @xmath3(x,\\phi)$ ] is given by @xmath8(x,\\phi ) = \\frac{1}{4}\\int_{0}^{\\infty } \\!\\ ! dr \\ : \\hbox{tr}\\left\\{o \\ : \\cos \\left[\\sqrt{r } ( x-{x}_{\\phi})\\right ] \\right\\ } \\label{kerdef}\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] actually , the tomographic kernel @xmath3(x,\\phi)$ ] for a given operator @xmath9 is not unique , since a large class of _ null functions _",
    "@xcite @xmath10 exists that have zero tomographic average for arbitrary state .",
    "this degree of freedom can be exploited to _ adapt _ the kernel to data and achieve an optimized determination of the quantity of interest .",
    "for example , quantities like the photon number , the field amplitude and any normally ordered moment can be the tomographically estimated by averaging the following kernel @xmath11(x,\\phi)= r[o](x,\\phi ) + \\sum_{k=0}^{m-1 } \\mu_k f_k(x,\\phi ) + \\sum_{k=0}^{m-1 } \\mu_k^ * f_k^*(x,\\phi ) \\label{knull1}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the kernels @xmath3 $ ] for the moments are given by @xcite @xmath12(x;\\phi)=e^{i(m - n)\\phi } \\frac{h_{n+m}(\\sqrt{2}\\:x)}{\\sqrt{2^{n+m}}{{n+m}\\choose n}}\\label{ric}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath13 being the hermite polynomial of order @xmath14 , and the _ null functions _",
    "@xmath15 are expressed as @xmath16 the coefficients @xmath17 are obtained by minimizing the rms error for the given kernel on the given homodyne sample .",
    "a similar approach can be applied to optimize the reconstruction of the matrix elements @xmath18 , thus achieving an effective quantum state characterization .",
    "the state reconstruction method provided by qht is effective and reliable , such that it can be exploited to build a tool to characterize quantum devices . the general scheme for such a tool should be as follows .",
    "first , we need a stable source of quantum states , _",
    "i.e. _ a source able to provide repeated preparations of a reference signal",
    ". the signal can be characterized by qht , and then employed as input of a given device , which we want to characterize by the estimation of some relevant parameters . at the output , the transformed state can analyzed by qht , such to characterize the input - output relations of the device .    in order to implement this kind of scheme",
    "two basic requirements should be satisfied : i ) we need a stable source for the reference signal , and ii ) an effective data processing for the tomographic samples should be devised , in order to minimize the number of measureements .",
    "the first point can be satisfied by considering gaussian signals , like coherent or squeezed states .",
    "indeed , quantum signals that are most likely to be reliably generated in a lab are gaussian states .",
    "the most general gaussian state can be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes a thermal state @xmath21^{a^\\dag a}$ ] , @xmath22 $ ] the squeezing operator and @xmath23 the displacement operator .",
    "however , thermal excitations can be neglected at optical frequencies , such that we may generally consider @xmath20 as the vacuum state .",
    "the homodyne distribution of the state @xmath24 at phase @xmath2 with respect to the local oscillator is gaussian and , remarkably , such gaussian character is not altered by many transformations induced by optical devices , such as the loss of a component , the gain of an amplifier or the quantum efficiency of a detector . in this paper",
    "we consider the reference signal excited in a coherent state .",
    "more general signals will be considered elsewhere .",
    "the need of an effective data processing lead to consider either adaptive or maximum - likelihood ( ml ) procedures on the tomographic data . in section [",
    "s : data ] we apply adaptive tomography for the estimation of losses induced by optical filters .",
    "here , we illustrate the use of ml procedure to the characterization of a general ( active or passive ) optical media , which we plan to perform experimentally in the near future .",
    "let us start by reviewing the ml approach .",
    "let @xmath25 the probability density of a random variable @xmath6 , conditioned to the value of the parameter @xmath26 .",
    "the analytical form of @xmath27 is known , but the true value of the parameter @xmath26 is unknown , and should be estimated from the result of a measurement of @xmath6 . let @xmath28 be a random sample of size @xmath29 .",
    "the joint probability density of the independent random variable @xmath28 ( the global probability of the sample ) is given by @xmath30 and is called the likelihood function of the given data sample .",
    "the ml estimator of the parameter @xmath26 is defined as the quantity @xmath31 that maximizes @xmath32 for variations of @xmath26 .",
    "since the likelihood is positive this is equivalent to maximize @xmath33 which is the so - called log - likelihood function .",
    "let us consider a generic optical media : the propagation of a signal is governed , for negligible saturation effects , by the master equation @xmath34\\,\\varrho + g_2\\ , l[a^\\dag ] \\,\\varrho \\;,\\label{meq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the density matrix describing the quantum state of the signal mode @xmath35 and @xmath36 $ ] denotes the lindblad superoperator @xmath36 a = o\\,a\\,o^\\dag -\\frac 12 o^\\dag o\\,a - \\frac 12 \\,a\\,o^\\dag o$ ] .",
    "if we model the propagation as the interaction of a traveling wave single - mode @xmath35 with a system of n identical two - level atoms , then the absorption @xmath37 and amplification @xmath38 parameters are related to the number @xmath39 and @xmath40 of atoms in the lower and upper level respectively .",
    "the quantity @xmath41 is a rate of the order of the atomic linewidth @xcite , and the propagation gain ( or deamplification ) is given by @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "a medium described by the master equation ( [ meq ] ) represents a kind of phase - insensitive optical device , such that the parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 can be estimated starting from random phase tomographic data . according to ( [ meq ] ) ,",
    "the homodyne distribution of a coherent signal with initial amplitude @xmath45 is given , after the propagation , by @xmath46 ^ 2 \\right\\}\\;.\\label{x1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 ( for non - unit quantum efficiency @xmath50 , @xmath51 . by ml estimation on homodyne data",
    "we may reconstruct the parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the resulting method has proven efficient by numerical simulations @xcite , and provides a precise determination of the absorption and amplification parameters of the master equation using small homodyne data sample .",
    "notice that no advantage in using squeezed states should be expected , because of the phase - insensitive character of the device .",
    "a schematic of the experiment is presented in fig . [",
    "f : exp ] .",
    "the principal radiation source is provided by a monolithic nd : yag laser ( @xmath52 50 mw @1064 nm ; lightwave , model 142 ) .",
    "the laser has a linewidth of less than 10 khz / ms with a frequency jitter of less than 300 khz / s , while its intensity spectrum is shot  noise limited above 2.5 mhz .",
    "the laser emits a linearly polarized beam in a tem00 mode .",
    "the laser is protected from back reflection by a faraday rotator ( fr ) whose output polarizing beam splitter can be adjusted to obtain an output beam of variable intensity .",
    "the beam outing the isolator , of @xmath53 2.5 mw , is then split into two part of variable relative intensity by a combination of a halfwave plate ( hwp@xmath54 ) and a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs , p  transmitted ,",
    "s  reflected ) .",
    "the strongest part , is directly sent toward the homodyne beam ",
    "splitter ( bs ) where it acts as the local oscillator beam .",
    "one of the mirror in the local oscillator path is piezo mounted to obtain a variable phase difference between the two beam .",
    "the remaining part , typically less than 200@xmath55w , is the homodyne signal .",
    "the optical paths traveled by the local oscillator and the signal beams are carefully adjusted to obtain a visibility typically above @xmath56 measured at one of the homodyne output port .",
    "the signal beam is modulated , by means of a phase electro ",
    "optic modulator ( eom , linos photonics pm0202 ) , at 4mhz , and a halfwave plate ( hwp@xmath57 , hwp@xmath58 ) is mounted in each path to carefully match the polarization state at the homodyne input .",
    "the basic property of the homodyne detector ( described into details in ref .",
    "@xcite ) is a narrow  band detection of the field fluctuations around 4mhz .",
    "the detector is composed by a 50@xmath5950 beam splitter ( bs ) , two amplified photodiodes ( pd1 , pd2 ) , and a power combiner .",
    "the difference photocurrent is demodulated at 4mhz by means of an electrical mixer . in this way",
    "the detection occurs outside any technical noise and , more important , in a spectral region where the laser does not carry excess noise .",
    "the phase modulation added to the signal beam move a certain number of photons , proportional to the square of the modulation depth , from the carrier optical frequency @xmath60 to the side bands at @xmath61 so generating two few photons coherent state , with engineered average photon number , at frequencies @xmath61 .",
    "the sum sideband modes is then detected as a controlled perturbation attached to the signal beam @xcite .",
    "the demodulated current is acquired by a digital oscilloscope ( tektronix tds 520d ) with 8 bit resolution and record length of 250000 points per run .",
    "the acquisition is triggered by a triangular shaped waveform applied to the pzt mounted on the local oscillator path .",
    "the piezo ramp is adjusted to obtain a @xmath62 phase variation between the local oscillator and the signal beam in an acquisition window .",
    "the homodyne data , to be used for tomographic reconstruction of the radiation state , have been calibrated according to the noise of the vacuum state .",
    "this is obtained by acquiring a set of data leaving the signal beam undisturbed while scanning the local oscillator phase .",
    "it is important to note that in case of the vacuum state no role is played by the visibility at the homodyne beam  splitter .",
    "our tomographic samples consist of @xmath29 homodyne data @xmath63 with phases @xmath64 equally spaced with respect to the local oscillator . since the piezo ramp is active during the whole acquisition time , we have a single value @xmath65 for any phase @xmath66 . from calibrated data we first reconstruct the quantum state of the homodyne signal . according to the experimental setup described in the previous section",
    "we expect a coherent signal with nominal amplitude that can be adjusted by varying the modulation depth of the optical mixer . however , since we do not compensate for the quantum efficiency of photodiodes in the homodyne detector ( @xmath67 ) we expect to reveal coherent signals with reduced amplitude with respect to actual one .",
    "in addition , the amplitude is furtherly reduced by the non - maximum visibility ( ranging from @xmath56 to @xmath68 ) at the homodyne beam  splitter .    in fig . [",
    "f : rec ] we show a typical reconstruction , together with the reconstruction of the vacuum state used for calibration . for both states , we report the raw data , the photon number distribution , _ i.e. _ the diagonal elements @xmath69 of the density matrix in the fock representation , and a contour plot of the wigner function .",
    "the matrix elements are obtained by sampling the corresponding kernel functions @xmath70 ( x,\\phi ) = 2 \\exp\\left\\{-ik \\phi \\right\\}\\sqrt{% 2^k n!(n+k ) ! } \\ : f_{nk}(x)\\:,\\ ] ] where @xmath71 and @xmath72 denotes a confluent hypergeometric function .",
    "the tomographic determination of the matrix elements is given by the averages @xmath73}=\\frac1n \\sum_j r[\\ :    whereas the corresponding confidence intervals are given ( for diagonal elements ) by @xmath74 , @xmath75 being the rms deviation of the kernel @xmath76 over data ( for off - diagonal elements the confidence intervals are evaluated for the real and imaginary part separately ) .    in order to see the quantum state as a whole",
    ", we also report the reconstruction of the wigner function of the field , which is defined as follows @xmath77 and can be expressed in terms of the matrix elements as @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 denotes the laguerre polynomials . of course , the series in eq .",
    "( [ w2 ] ) should be truncated at some point , and therefore the wigner function can be reconstructed only at some finite resolution .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^ , > \" , ]     once the coherence of the signal has been established we may use qht to estimate the loss imposed by a passive optical component like an optical filter .",
    "the procedure may be outlined as follows .",
    "we first estimate the initial mean photon number @xmath81 of the signal beam , and then the same quantity inserting an optical neutral density filter in the signal path .",
    "if @xmath82 is the loss parameter , then the coherent amplitude is reduced to @xmath83 , and the intensity to @xmath84 .",
    "the estimation of the mean photon number can be performed adaptively on data by taking the average of the kernel @xmath85(x)=2 x^2 - \\frac{1}{2 } + \\mu e^{i2\\phi } + \\mu^ * e^{-i2\\phi } \\ ; , \\label{num}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 is a parameter to be determined in order to minimize fluctuations . as proved in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath87 , which itself can be obtained from homodyne data . in practice",
    ", one uses the data sample twice : first to evaluate @xmath86 , then to obtain the estimate for the mean photon number .    in fig .",
    "[ f : loss ] the tomographic determinations of @xmath88 are compared with the expected values for three set of experiments , corresponding to three different initial amplitudes . the expected values are given by @xmath89 , where @xmath82 is the value obtained by comparing the signal dc currents @xmath90 and @xmath91 at the homodyne photodiodes and @xmath92 is the relative visibility .",
    "the solid line in fig .",
    "[ f : loss ] denotes these values . the line is not continuos due to variations of visibility . as it is apparent from the plot the estimation is reliable in the whole range of values we could explore .",
    "it is worth noticing that the present estimation is absolute , _ i.e. _ it does not depends on the knowledge of the initial amplitude , and it is robust , since it may performed independently on the quantum efficiency of the photodiodes employed for the homodyne detector .",
    "in this paper we addressed qht as a tool for the characterization of quantum optical devices .",
    "we carried out the quantum state reconstruction of coherent signals , and show how qht can be used to reliably estimate the loss imposed by an optical filter .",
    "we also show that the estimation procedure can be extended to the characterization of general ( active or passive ) optical devices , which we plan to perform experimentally in the near future .",
    "we also plan to extend our analysis to squeezed signals since it has been proved @xcite that squeezing improves precision in the homodyne estimation of relevant parameters such the phase - shift or the quantum efficiency of a photodetector .",
    "in particular , our aim is to reproduce the described measurement scheme at the output of an opo cavity @xcite driven below threshold to generate vacuum squeezed radiation .",
