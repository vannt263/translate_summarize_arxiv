    "since then , the sdss has so far discovered about a dozen quasars at @xmath94 with rest - frame ly@xmath6 equivalent width smaller than 5   ( e.g. , anderson et al . 2001 ; collinge et al . 2005 ) .",
    "they appear to form a distinct class of high - redshift _ lineless _ quasars .",
    "sdss j1335 + 3533 represents the most distant member of this class of objects .",
