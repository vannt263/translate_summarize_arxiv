    "the problem of approximate reduction of the time - dependent 3d equation describing the local concentration field @xmath0 of pointlike particles diffusing in a tube of varying with the longitudinal coordinate @xmath1 cross section to an effective time - dependent 1d equation appeared to be fairly tricky .",
    "for the first time , following the main idea of fick s approach , such kind of 1d equation was derived in 1935 by jacobs.jacobs:1967 particularly for a channel with a shape of a surface of revolution the relevant 1d equation reads@xmath2 \\right\\ } ,   \\label{in1}\\]]where @xmath3 is the translational diffusion coefficient in space with no constraints , @xmath4 ^{2}$ ] is the area of the tube cross - section @xmath5 of radius @xmath6 at a given point @xmath1 of the symmetry axis .",
    "the corresponding reduced concentration @xmath7 is calculated by the formula @xmath8nowadays the reduced diffusion equation ( [ in1 ] ) is commonly referred to as the fick - jacobs equation ( fje ) .",
    "in addition we will call eq .",
    "( [ in1 ] ) a classical form of the fje .",
    "it is interesting that , if we do not take into account a few works on this subject , for decades the fje remained almost unclaimed .",
    "situation has been changed drastically after 1992 when well - known zwanzig s article renewed the problem and stimulated considerable interest to this topic.@xcite soon it turned out that the problem on diffusion in a tube of varying cross section is of great importance for numerous applications dealing with artificial and natural transport processes and thence many researchers studied it within different facets of theory and applications.grathwohl:1998,konkoli:2005,berezhkovskii:2007,dendrites:2008,burada:2008,ai:2008,wang:2009,mondal:2010,dagdug:2010,biess:2011,dagdug:2011,berezhkovskii:2012 even now these kind of investigations are close to the top among hot research topics on the diffusion - influenced processes in confined regions.@xcite    in his seminal paper zwanzig drew attention to the fact that jacobs derivation is rather heuristic and , besides , it is completely free of impermeable wall boundary condition that should be imposed on the solution of the original higher dimensional diffusion equation .",
    "moreover , jacobs did not present any reasons for choosing the center line of the tube.zwanzig:1992 taking into account that the fje has exactly the same mathematical structure as the smoluchowski equation for diffusion in a 1d potential field , zwanzig derived the fje starting from the general diffusion equation with a potential.@xcite according to zwanzig the fje may be presented in the form@xmath9 \\right\\ } .",

    "slowly with increasing of the longitudinal variable @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath14hereafter in the paper @xmath15 , he also proposed a generalized form of the fje .",

    "as in refs . 17 and 19",
    "we suppose here that the diffusion matrix is diagonal with transverse isotropy , i.e. , @xmath21diag@xmath22 , and that @xmath23 is the transverse and @xmath24 is the longitudinal translational diffusion coefficient , respectively . in",

    "thus , the purpose of this paper is twofold .",
    "firstly using rigorous technique of the matched asymptotic expansions lagerstrom:1988,ilin:1992 we consider the 3d anisotropic diffusion equation ( [ in3 ] ) which describes the diffusion of pointlike particles into a tube with impermeable wall having the shape of a surface of revolution . secondly accurate asymptotic solution of the original 3d problem for all spatial and temporal scales allows us to elucidate the role , physical and mathematical sense and lastly accuracy of the leading - term approximation and , particularly , the validity of the fick - jacobs approximation .",
