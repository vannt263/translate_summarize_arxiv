    "the study of hadron @xmath10-decays gives important information on the interplay between the weak interaction and the hadronic structure determined by the strong interaction .",
    "this information is richer for baryon than for meson semileptonic decays owing to the presence of three valence quarks as opposed to a quark - antiquark pair . in this context",
    ", @xmath11 @xmath10-decay represents an extraordinary opportunity to test , by analogy with neutron @xmath10-decay , su(3 ) symmetry and , through the determination of @xmath12 , the quark mixing model  @xcite .    in the exact su(3 )",
    "symmetry approximation , the ratio between the axial - vector form factor @xmath13 and the vector form factor @xmath14 for @xmath15 @xmath10-decay is equal to the one for the decay @xmath16 .",
    "theoretical models that incorporate su(3 ) symmetry breaking effects give predictions which , however , differ significantly from each other @xcite .",
    "precise tests of su(3 ) symmetry breaking effects calculations in semileptonic hyperon decays are therefore important in connection with the determination of @xmath12 , independently from kaon decays .",
    "recently , the ktev experiment has obtained the first determination of the @xmath17 ratio in @xmath18 decays from the study of the @xmath19 polarization with the decay @xmath20 and the @xmath21 correlation  @xcite .",
    "their result , based on the observation of 487 events , is consistent with exact su(3 ) symmetry : @xmath22 .",
    "previously , the same collaboration published the value of the branching ratio br(@xmath23 from a sample of 176 events after background subtraction  @xcite .    in the present work",
    ", the @xmath15 and @xmath24 @xmath10-decay modes have been investigated with significantly improved statistics as compared to previous experiments .",
    "the corresponding branching ratios were determined relative to the decay channels @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively , allowing the measurement of the matrix element @xmath8 .",
    "conversely , using as input parameter the current experimental value for @xmath12 from semileptonic kaon decays , the form factor @xmath17 was determined .",
    "the main goal of the na48/1 experiment is the study of very rare @xmath27 decay modes and neutral hyperon decays .",
    "a detailed description of the beam line and the detector can be found in  @xcite . only the aspects relevant to this measurement are reviewed here .",
    "the experiment was performed at the cern sps accelerator and used a 400  gev / c proton beam impinging on a be target to produce a neutral beam .",
    "the spill length was 4.8  s out of a 16.2  s cycle time .",
    "the proton intensity was fairly constant during the spill with a mean of @xmath28 particles per pulse .    for this measurement ,",
    "only the @xmath27 target station of the na48 double @xmath29 beam line  @xcite was used to produce the neutral beam . in this configuration ,",
    "the @xmath30 beam was blocked and an additional sweeping magnet was installed to deflect charged particles away from the defining section of the @xmath31 collimators . to reduce the number of photons in the neutral beam originating primarily from @xmath32 decays ,",
    "a 24  mm thick platinum absorber was placed in the beam between the target and the collimator . a pair of coaxial collimators , having a total thickness of 5.1  m , the axis of which formed an angle of 4.2  mrad to the proton beam direction , selected a beam of neutral long - lived particles ( @xmath31 , @xmath30 , @xmath33 , @xmath11 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) .",
    "the aperture of the defining collimator , 5.03  m downstream of the target , was a circle with 1.8  mm radius .",
    "the target position and the production angle where chosen in such a way that the beam axis was hitting the center of the electromagnetic calorimeter .    in order to minimize the interaction of the neutral beam with air ,",
    "the collimator was immediately followed by a @xmath36  m long evacuated tank terminated by a 0.3@xmath37 @xmath38 thick kevlar window .",
    "the na48 detector was located downstream of this region in order to collect the products of the particles decaying in the volume contained by the tank .    on average , about @xmath39 @xmath15 per spill , with an energy between 70 and 220  gev , decayed in the fiducial decay volume .",
    "the detector included a spectrometer housed in a helium gas volume with two drift chambers before ( dch1 , dch2 ) and two after ( dch3 , dch4 ) a dipole magnet with a horizontal transverse momentum kick of 265  mev / c .",
    "each chamber had four views ( _ x , y , u , v _ ) , each of which had two sense wire planes .",
    "in dch1 , dch2 and dch4 , all wire planes were instrumented while in the drift chamber located just downstream of the magnet ( dch3 ) , only vertical and horizontal wire planes were read out .",
    "the resulting space points were reconstructed with a resolution of about 150  @xmath40 m in each projection .",
    "the spectrometer momentum resolution could be parameterized as : @xmath41    where @xmath42 is in gev / c .",
    "this resulted in a resolution of about 1  mev / c@xmath43 when reconstructing the @xmath44 mass in @xmath45 decays .",
    "the track time resolution was about 1.4  ns .",
    "the electromagnetic showers were detected and measured with a 27 radiation - length deep liquid krypton calorimeter ( lkr ) read out in longitudinal cells with a @xmath46  cm@xmath43 cross - section .",
    "the energy resolution was given by  @xcite :    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is in gev . the transverse position resolution for a single photon of energy larger than 20  gev was better than 1.3 mm and the corresponding mass resolution at the @xmath32 mass was about 1  mev / c@xmath43 .",
    "the time resolution of the calorimeter for a single shower was better than 300  ps .",
    "a scintillating fiber hodoscope ( nhod ) , placed inside the lkr calorimeter at a depth of about 9.5  @xmath38 near the shower maximum , was used for trigger efficiency measurements .",
    "the lkr calorimeter was followed by a hadron calorimeter ( hac ) consisting of an iron - scintillator sandwich , 6.7 nuclear interaction lengths thick .",
    "the hac provided a raw measurement of the energy for hadron showers and it was only used at the first trigger level .",
    "a scintillator hodoscope ( chod ) was located between the spectrometer and the calorimeter .",
    "it consisted of two planes , segmented in horizontal and vertical strips and arranged in four quadrants .",
    "the chod time resolution was better than 200  ps for 2-track events .",
    "muon counters made of three planes of scintillator , each shielded by an iron wall , were placed at the downstream end of the apparatus .",
    "seven rings of scintillation counters ( akl ) , placed around the evacuated decay volume and around the helium tank of the charged particle spectrometer , were used to veto activity outside the acceptance region of the detector determined by the lkr calorimeter .",
    "the trigger system used for the on - line selection of @xmath15 @xmath10-decays consisted of three levels of logic . level 1 ( l1 ) was based on logic combinations of fast signals coming from various sub - detectors .",
    "it required hits in the chod and in the first drift chamber compatible with at least one and two tracks respectively , no hit in the akl veto system and a minimum energy deposition in the calorimeters .",
    "this last requirement was 15  gev for the energy reconstructed in the lkr calorimeter or 30  gev for the summed energy in the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters .",
    "the output rate of the l1 stage was about 50khz .",
    "the average l1 efficiency , measured with @xmath25 events of energy greater than 70gev , was found to be @xmath50 .",
    "level 2 ( l2 ) consisted of 300mhz processors that reconstructed tracks and vertices from hits in the drift chambers and computed relevant physical quantities .",
    "the l2 trigger required at least two tracks with a closest distance of approach of less than 8  cm in space and a transverse separation greater than 5  cm in the first drift chamber . since the signature of the @xmath11 @xmath10-decay involves the detection of an energetic proton from the subsequent @xmath51 decay , the ratio between the higher and the lower of the two track momenta was required to be larger than 3.5 .",
    "rejection of the overwhelming @xmath52 and @xmath53 decays was achieved by applying stringent invariant mass cuts according to the corresponding event hypotheses , @xmath54 or @xmath55 ( see fig .",
    "[ kincut ] ) .",
    "the output l2 trigger rate was about 2.5khz .",
    "the efficiency of the l2 trigger stage with respect to level 1 , averaged over the 2002 run , was measured to be @xmath56 for @xmath15 @xmath10-decays , mainly limited by wire inefficiencies in the drift chambers .",
    "the l2 trigger output rate was further reduced by about a factor 2 at level 3 ( l3 ) .",
    "the l3 trigger consisted of a farm of computers which used a specialized version of the off - line reconstruction code .",
    "it combined track measurements with clusters in the lkr calorimeter and used loose selection criteria .",
    "the inefficiency of the l3 trigger was measured to be less than @xmath57 . for normalization and efficiency determination purposes ,",
    "the l3 trigger also received events from downscaled l1 triggers as well as from nhod pulses .",
    "invariant mass versus momentum ratio of positive to negative particles for 2-track vertices as selected by the l1 trigger .",
    "events coming from @xmath58 and @xmath59 decays are clearly visible .",
    "@xmath60 decays are located in the @xmath61 region .",
    "the kinematical regions rejected by the l2 trigger are also shown .",
    ", width=377 ]",
    "the identification of the @xmath63 channel was performed using the subsequent decay @xmath64 with @xmath65 .",
    "the final state consisted of a proton and an electron leaving tracks in the spectrometer in addition to two photons being detected as clusters in the lkr calorimeter and one unobserved anti - neutrino .",
    "the decay @xmath66 is the only source of @xmath67 particles in the neutral beam since the two - body decay @xmath68 is kinematically forbidden .",
    "thus , the signal events were identified by requiring an invariant @xmath69 mass consistent with the nominal @xmath67 mass value .",
    "the two tracks were required to be less than 2  ns apart in time , measured by the charged hodoscope or by the drift chambers when the hodoscope readout was not able to reconstruct the track time .",
    "this occurred for about 2@xmath37 of the events , mainly due to the presence of double - pulses from the scintillator photomultipliers . to suppress contamination from accidental activity in the detector , events with an additional track within a time window of 20  ns with respect to the average time of the signal tracks",
    "were rejected .",
    "the lower momentum thresholds for positive and negative tracks were set to 40  gev / c and 4  gev / c , respectively ( fig .",
    "[ signal1](a ) and fig .",
    "[ signal2](a ) ) .",
    "the momentum ratio between positive and negative tracks was required to be greater than 4.5 and the distance between the impact points of the two tracks in the first chamber was chosen to be greater than 12  cm in order to reduce biases from the corresponding cuts applied by l2 . to ensure full efficiency in the track reconstruction , the radial distance to the beam axis of the reconstructed space points in the drift chambers had to lie between 12.5  cm and 110  cm .",
    "electron identification was achieved by calculating the ratio @xmath70 of the cluster energy in the lkr calorimeter associated to the track with the measured momentum in the spectrometer .",
    "since electrons deposited their total energy in the electromagnetic calorimeter , their @xmath70 ratio was required to be between 0.85 and 1.15 . for protons ,",
    "the @xmath70 value was required to be less than 0.8 . to avoid shower overlap , a minimum transverse distance of at least 15  cm",
    "was imposed between track impact points on the calorimeter surface .",
    "the distance between the two tracks at the point of closest approach had to be less than 3  cm . in order to minimize",
    "the background coming from @xmath71 decays with @xmath72 and @xmath73 misidentified as electron , the difference between the nominal @xmath44 mass and the reconstructed invariant mass of the two tracks under the @xmath74 hypothesis had to be greater than 14  mev / c@xmath43 .",
    "background from @xmath75 decays with one accidental @xmath32 or two accidental photons was suppressed by rejecting events with an invariant @xmath76 mass within 30  mev / c@xmath43 of the nominal kaon mass and with a momentum ratio less than 6 .",
    "the last three selection criteria were tighter than the ones used in the trigger to reduce biases from l2 trigger inefficiencies .",
    "the two - photon clusters forming a neutral pion candidate had to be within a time window of 2  ns and the energy of each cluster was required to be in the 3 - 100  gev range . the reconstructed @xmath77 energy distribution is shown in fig .  [ signal1](b ) .",
    "inner and outer regions of the lkr calorimeter were excluded by requiring the radial distance to the beam axis of each cluster to be between 15  cm and 110  cm . moreover ,",
    "the center of each cluster was required to be at a distance greater than 2  cm from any dead calorimeter cell . to avoid biases in the energy measurement of the photons due to shower contamination induced by other particles , their associated clusters had to have a minimal distance from other clusters measured within a time window of 5  ns .",
    "this minimal separation was set to 10  cm for electron and photon candidates and to 25  cm for hadronic showers associated with proton tracks .",
    "photons originating from bremsstrahlung produced in the detector material before the magnet were rejected by measuring the separation at the lkr location between clusters and the impact point of the extrapolated upstream segment of a track . the @xmath67 decay was reconstructed using a positive charged track in the spectrometer and two clusters in the electromagnetic calorimeter within a time window of 2  ns .",
    "the longitudinal position of the @xmath67 decay vertex was determined using the @xmath32 mass constraint to calculate the distance of its decay point from the calorimeter : @xmath78 where @xmath79 , @xmath80 are the energies and @xmath81 the distance between the two clusters in the transverse plane of the calorimeter . the transverse position of the vertex was then obtained by extrapolating back the proton track to the longitudinal position of the @xmath32 decay point .",
    "the momentum vector of the decaying @xmath67 particle was calculated from the proton track parameters , the photon energies and assuming the emitted photons originate from the reconstructed vertex .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the branching ratio for @xmath82 decays was measured to be : @xmath83 in very good agreement with the value obtained above for @xmath11 @xmath10-decays . the relative systematic uncertainty of @xmath84 is dominated by the trigger efficiency determination .",
    "contributions to the systematic uncertainty from form factors , geometrical cuts and acceptance , rescattering effects in the final collimator as well as normalization were obtained from the study of the semileptonic @xmath11 decay .",
    "the @xmath8 parameter can be extracted from the measured @xmath11 semileptonic decay rates using the following relation  @xcite :    @xmath86    where @xmath87  s is the @xmath15 lifetime , @xmath88  gev/@xmath89 and @xmath90  @xcite , @xmath91 and @xmath92 are , respectively , model - dependent and model - independent radiative corrections and @xmath93 takes into account the contribution from the transfer momentum dependence of the form - factors @xmath94 and @xmath95  @xcite .",
