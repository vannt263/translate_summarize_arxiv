    "chemotaxis is frequently observed in microorganisms .",
    "bacteria move in the direction of a higher concentration of an attractive chemical .",
    "although chemotactic behavior is conserved throughout evolution , bacteria never move toward a goal directly , but instead often tumble by changing direction randomly . by changing the tumbling frequency ,",
    "bacteria assemble around their goal , the region rich in attractants .",
    "experimental bacterial systems show that bacteria regulate the rate of tumbling and their speed , but change direction randomly .",
    "bacteria move faster but rarely tumble when located in a region with a high concentration of attractant , whereas they tumble frequently at low speed in a region with a lower concentration",
    ". however , this experimental observation seems peculiar if one considers only normal brownian movement , because a high tumbling frequency should yield a small bacterial diffusion constant in the continuum limit , making the attraction to a high - concentration region impossible .    by assuming an internal state with adaptation dynamics of a certain timescale into the element exhibiting brownian motion , oosawa and nakaoka showed more than 25 years ago that chemotactic behavior is possible  @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the existence of memory in the internal state makes chemotaxis possible .",
    "in contrast , de gennes  @xcite noted recently that the elements can move in a favorable direction despite not having an internal state to retain some memory .",
    "however , this is true only for short - term behavior of chemotaxis .",
    "as clark and grant reported  @xcite , the steady distribution of long - term behavior is not biased toward a favorable region .",
    "a temporal change of tumbling frequency with some memory is required to have a biased steady distribution . by assuming a class of autocorrelation function for the change of tumbling frequency",
    ", clark and grant showed that the steady distribution of bacteria can be biased toward the favorable region .",
    "in addition , by introducing some constraints and optimizing both the short - term and long - term chemotactic behavior , they obtained a beautiful solution to the optimal correlation function .    from a biological viewpoint ,",
    "the temporal change of the tumbling frequency is a result of intracellular dynamics . for any given intracellular dynamics ,",
    "arbitrary autocorrelation function is not possible , and we were interested in studying the way that specific intracellular dynamics allow for chemotactic behavior .",
    "such a condition was proposed previously by oosawa and nakaoka  @xcite , who studied the steady - state distribution of cells with internal adaptive dynamics and the conditions for chemotactic behavior .",
    "when the environment changes , bacteria must immediately sense the change and gradually adapt to the new environment by exploiting the dynamics of the internal state .",
    "oosawa and nakaoka showed that bacteria can not move toward a region with a higher chemical concentration if the tumbling timescale @xmath0 is faster than the sensing timescale @xmath1 to detect the environmental change or slower than the timescale @xmath2 for the adaptation .",
    "when tumbling faster , bacteria tumble randomly without any directional motion , whereas slower tumbling causes the information about direction to disappear before the tumbling rate changes .",
    "the proposed condition , which we call the oosawa condition , states that the tumbling timescale @xmath0 is greater than the sensing timescale ( @xmath3 ) and smaller than the adaptation timescale ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the optimal solution by clark and grant  @xcite satisfies this oosawa condition .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a model of an explicit internal dynamic system with two degrees of freedom that responds and adapts to the external environment .",
    "these internal dynamics correspond to some intracellular reaction process , which exhibits both quick - sensing and slow - adaptive processes where the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 are derived from the parameters characterizing the intracellular reaction dynamics . using this model , we examined the validity of the oosawa condition for chemotactic behavior .",
    "we first demonstrate this condition for a chemical concentration field with a step function in space .",
    "next , using a field with a continuous slope , we describe our observations of chemotactic behavior in a broader regime than originally proposed .",
    "we explain this apparent discrepancy from the oosawa condition by the renormalization of bare timescales through the bacterial motion within the slope . using these renormalized timescales ,",
    "we reconfirm the relevance of the oosawa condition .",
    "we first introduced an internal state of a cell that responds and adapts to the external concentration of the signal chemical , and controls the tumbling frequency .",
    "this internal variable is denoted by @xmath5 , which might be , for example , the concentration of some protein in the cell that responds to the external chemical and controls the tumbling frequency .",
    "this internal chemical responds to the concentration of the attractive chemical component ( termed @xmath6 here ) in the field . as the cell moves and the concentration of the external chemical increases , the concentration @xmath5 increases and returns to the original value , a process known as adaptation  @xcite .",
    "the simplest way to have such adaptation dynamics is by introducing another internal chemical , whose concentration is given by @xmath7 , so that the change of concentrations is governed by @xmath8 we assume here that the fixed point solution @xmath9 given by @xmath10 is stable .",
    "if @xmath11 increases with @xmath6 and @xmath12 is independent of @xmath6 , the response to @xmath6 and adaptation are satisfied because @xmath5 increases with @xmath6 first , and then returns to the original @xmath12 . here , when the solution @xmath13 involves @xmath5 but not @xmath7 , the latter constraint is satisfied .",
    "for example , @xmath14 satisfies the condition , where @xmath15 are positive constants . in this paper",
    ", we report our study of such a case , with @xmath16 corresponding to the reaction process @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and degradation of @xmath5 and @xmath7 .",
    "another simple example , originally introduced by othmer  @xcite is given by @xmath19 , which gives the linear dynamics @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 as positive constants .",
    "we also briefly discuss the result of this model . in both models , after @xmath6 increases , @xmath5 first increases but later returns to the @xmath6-independent fixed - point concentration given by @xmath23 in the model eq.(2 ) .",
    "we set the parameter values so that the fixed - point solution @xmath9 is stable . in the model eq.(2 ) , this condition is given by @xmath24 . in this case , following the increase ( decrease ) of @xmath6 , @xmath5 first increases ( decreases ) from @xmath12 and then returns to the original value exponentially with time and shows a peak in time .",
    "the sensing time @xmath1 is estimated as the time to reach this peak and is given by @xmath25 .",
    "in contrast , the adaptation time @xmath2 is estimated by the relaxation time towards the fixed point , given by the eigenvalue of the linearized equation of ( 2 ) around the fixed point , and is @xmath26 .",
    "in this way , the internal timescales are represented by the reaction parameters .",
    "in general , the tumbling frequency is controlled by the internal state @xmath5 , which we assume is given by a continuous function of the concentration @xmath5 .",
    "the tumbling occurs randomly in experiments , whereas the rate changes in response to the external signal @xmath6 .",
    "although the speed could also change slightly in bacteria , for simplicity we have changed only the rate of tumbling .",
    "we assume that the cell moves with a constant speed , until it changes direction , whose probability ( i.e. , the rate of tumbling ) @xmath27 is given by a function of @xmath5 . for @xmath28 , we set the rate as @xmath29 and assume that @xmath30 is an increasing function for @xmath5 .",
    "as an example , we take the form @xmath31 and choose the parameters so that @xmath30 approaches @xmath32 for @xmath33 , and @xmath34 for @xmath35 , while @xmath36 is set sufficiently large to respond a change in @xmath5 by eq.(2 ) .",
    "this specific choice is not essential and the results we discuss are valid provided that the rate ( @xmath27 ) approaches a value sufficiently smaller than @xmath29 for a large @xmath5 , and sufficiently larger than @xmath29 for small @xmath5 .",
    "this change in the tumbling frequency is consistent with experimental data  @xcite .",
    "note that the normal tumbling rate @xmath29 is independent of the intracellular dynamics , so both are independent of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "this allows us to examine the validity of the oosawa condition .",
    "hereafter , we take the elements satisfying eq.(2 ) and insert them into a one - dimensional space , where the external concentration is given as @xmath37 , to examine whether the elements assemble in a region with larger @xmath37 .",
    "as a first example , we consider the case with a step - function external field ( i.e. , @xmath38 for @xmath39 and @xmath40 for @xmath41 ) and examine whether the cells assemble in the region @xmath42 .",
    "the number fraction of cells at @xmath42 , numerically obtained for the steady state is plotted in fig .",
    "[ step ] by changing the parameter @xmath43 . in the simulation ,",
    "all cells were initially located at @xmath44 .",
    "the figure shows three examples of different internal timescales @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and the data without internal dynamics are plotted for reference . table .",
    "[ timeorder ] shows the time scales(@xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath45(to be defined later ) ) for the three cases we used in the plot .    as shown , the fraction of cells for @xmath42 peaks as @xmath43 changes . for all cases , the most effective tumbling time @xmath46 that gives a peak for the fraction lies at @xmath1 @xmath46 @xmath2 .",
    "all simulations for other parameters show that the elements assemble in the region @xmath42 , that is , the chemotaxis works well for @xmath1 @xmath43 @xmath2 .",
    "these results confirm the oosawa condition .",
    "in contrast , as @xmath43 increases for @xmath47 or decreased for @xmath48 , the fraction approaches @xmath49 , implying that chemotaxis is not possible .",
    "living organisms have many reactions with various timescales , which , when combined , cause adaptive functions to emerge .",
    "the proper use of different timescales is important when generating adaptive output behavior in response to changes in external conditions .",
    "the process of chemotaxis that we have discussed is one of the simplest mechanisms that takes advantage of the timescale differences , whereas the condition for different timescales can be generalized in a more complex reaction - network system , and in intercellular interactions@xcite .",
