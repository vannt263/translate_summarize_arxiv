    "dispersant materials used in response to oil spills@xcite undergo a demanding effectiveness approval process , and approved dispersants are stockpiled near drilling activity and possible spill locations .",
    "these factors inhibit continuous improvement of dispersants .",
    "rigorous laboratory studies of the molecular - thermodynamic interactions at play in dispersant systems are , therefore , particularly welcome . in addition , effective thermophysical modeling for these systems should improve the fidelity of laboratory - scale simulations of field - scale and ocean - scale oil spill dispersion .",
    "a typical prerequisite for development of effective molecularly specific thermophysical models is computational simulation of these solutions on a molecular basis .",
    "arguably the most important water - soluble synthetic polymers,@xcite ( -ch@xmath1-ch@xmath1-o-)@xmath6 chain molecules are also soluble in common organic solvents and are intrinsic to the dispersant materials in use.@xcite this report establishes molecular - scale microstructures of peo oligomers in aqueous solutions , information preparatory to molecular - scale theories of the structure and function of these species in solution .",
    "the molecular versatility of peo / peg polymers in solution makes them a challenge for molecularly specific statistical thermodynamic theory .",
    "for example , their conformations respond sensitively to the solution environment .",
    "@xcite common - sized peo molecules are distinctly helical in @xmath3-propanoic , isobutyric , and isopentanoic acid solutions coexisting with liquid water.@xcite that helicity emphasizes the contrasting behavior that these chains exhibit generic coil structures in aqueous solutions . though the helices are not evident in bulk liquid water , and indeed also not in acetic acid nor in isobutanol nor in @xmath3-butanol , helix formation does seem to require at least a trace of water.@xcite    the solvent plays an intrinsic role in the solution thermodynamics also .",
    "the conformational sensitivity noted above is associated with a polymer size fractionation between those coexisting solutions.@xcite  experimental evaluation of a flory - huggins interaction parameter for peo / peg in either water or methanol shows compositional dependence that is substantially different in these two cases.@xcite    in many applications,@xcite and specifically for dispersants used on oil spills,@xcite the peo / peg chains are decorated with junction , head , or capping groups .",
    "the work below anticipates those molecular designs , but treats explicitly only the simplest capping group , ( methyl ) -ch@xmath0 .",
    "correlations associated with capping groups serve to focus structural analyses and the following work focuses on the radial distributions of capping groups .",
    "alternatively , spatial extensions of chain molecules in solution are often characterized by a mean square - radius of gyration @xmath7 , and that information is addressed below for the cases treated .",
    "a conclusion we draw from the recent exhaustive treatment of longer alkanes in water@xcite is that distributions of @xmath8 are less informative of molecular structure than spatial correlations between chemical groups such as capping groups .",
    "the results below should provide further clarification of that issue .",
    "we note that single - molecule pulling experiments@xcite are becoming a new source of microstructural information , though not yet at the molecular resolution of interest in the present work .",
    "those important experiments do not track the radius of gyration specifically , but instead manipulate lengths between tethered chemical groups .",
    "numerous traditional statistical thermodynamics theories of aqueous peo / peg solutions have been suggested ; some representatives were noted in our initial report,@xcite and we do not attempt a review here .",
    "an alternative non - traditional procedure for theory development accepts that simulations are necessary for evaluation of molecular theories of liquids , that simulations will always be carried - out in any case , and so the simulation work might as well contribute to formulation of physical theories .",
    "of course , analyses for those purposes must express the natural physical concepts under - pinning molecular theories , and those analyses must be sufficiently general .",
    "we have elsewhere argued@xcite that the recent developed molecular quasi - chemical theory does achieve those requirements . that molecular quasi - chemical theory has lead over that past decade to resolution of the most basic puzzles of hydrophobic effects.@xcite it is our intention to establish , for the interesting and important aqueous solutions considered here , some of the groundwork required for fully defensible molecular theory .",
    "as noted already , direct high - resolution molecular simulations are necessary for the theory development that is sought . because these systems are of practical importance , a wide range of simulation calculations have been carried - out .",
    "again , we do not attempt a review here , but merely note a recent contribution@xcite that gives access to that substantial available literature .",
    "the results below were obtained by combination of standard molecular simulation procedures appropriate for the sampling requirements of different configurational aspects of ch@xmath0(ch@xmath1-o - ch@xmath1)@xmath2ch@xmath0 chain molecules in water and @xmath3-hexane solutions.@xcite further specific details are provided in the appendix .",
    "we note here that the combined results support comparisons over a range of molecule extensions , between different chain molecule lengths , between different - sized simulation systems , and between water and @xmath3-hexane solvents .",
    "a curiosity of this simulation work is that with the typical time - scales and length - scales it is easy to observe ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) molecular - scale break - up of a fluid column to produce droplets , and then reformation of a fluid column .",
    "we hope in subsequent work to return to these observations with further analysis .",

    "the majority material in the background is @xmath3-hexane.[fig : fig1],width=672 ]",
    "from small to large end - to - end lengths , the observed probability density ( fig .  [ fig : fig2 ] ) displays three distinct behaviors , loop - closure , globule , and high - extension ( elastic ) regions.@xcite the loop - closure feature is a realization of a primitive hydrophobic bond,@xcite which has been extensively studied by simulation but not yet susceptible to experimental measurement due to solubility limitations.@xcite in contrast ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ) , distributions of @xmath9 are less distinctive of these microstructural features .    for liquid water",
    "the loop - closure feature is largely independent of oligomer size ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ) .",
    "this feature in liquid water is different from what is observed in @xmath3-hexane and for non - solvated chains ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] ) .",
    "these points support the identification of the loop - closure feature as an experimentally realizable hydrophobic bond .",
    "the globule region is clear for the hydrated chains , but not for the case of @xmath3-hexane solvent ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] ) .",
    "thus in the more benign organic solvent the chains are collapsed relative to the more swollen hydrated oligomers .",
    "this also supports the interpretion of intrachain interactions from the perspective of simple aqueous solution examples .",
    "the profiles of the density of chain c - atoms , measured relative to the chain centroid , are different ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] ) for the two solvents . for @xmath3-hexane ,",
    "the density profiles are similar for the different chain lengths when the distances are scaled by the observed @xmath10 .",
    "this similarity does not obtain for the case for water . in water and for",
    "the smaller chains studied , the carbon material exhibits a distinctive enhanced concentration in the middle of the distribution , a concentration that is not evident for the case of @xmath3-hexane .",
    "this interesting internal condensation is characterized by a length - scale smaller than @xmath10 .",
    "thus the overall density profiles show less similarity on the @xmath10 scale , and the internal condensation feature is not evident for the largest @xmath4=31 chain .",

    "these values are larger than the ideal @xmath12 proportion of the observed @xmath13 [ fig : fig3],width=384 ]     1  nm for several chain lengths from windowing / wham calculations.[fig : fig4],width=384 ]    ( ch@xmath1-o - ch@xmath1)@xmath2ch@xmath0 ] ( @xmath4 = 21 ) oligomer behaves differently in @xmath3-hexane and water , and the results for @xmath3-hexane are similar to those obtained with no solvent ( ideal gas case ) .",
