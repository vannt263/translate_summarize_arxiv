    "every animal must eat in order to survive . for certain predator species this necessarily implies to chase and bring down a sufficient amount of prey .",
    "with predators always on the lookout for food , prey must constantly be on the alert . while scattering and zigzagging to confuse the predator is a popular method of herd animals to escape @xcite , if the escape paths are not well co - ordinated individual prey",
    "may also block each other .",
    "the self volume effect is also relevant in the hunt of killer cells ( macrophages , for instance ) in biological organisms attacking bacteria colonies or biofilms . in this paper",
    "we study the influence of self volume effects on a herd of non - communicating prey with the autonomy of taking decisions on the run , as quantified by the typical time to catch a prey .    in the study of the dynamics of predator - prey systems",
    "one is generically interested in the likelihood for the survival of the prey as a function of the parameters of the dynamics of both prey and predator .",
    "prototype mathematical models of predator - prey systems are reaction - diffusion models @xcite , in which both species are assumed to move randomly . in one dimension",
    "the survival probability of a diffusing prey exposed to a number of diffusing predators decays as a power law in time @xcite . in two dimensions",
    "the predators catch the prey with probability one , but the mean life time of the prey is infinite .",
    "the survival probability of a lamb in the presence of @xmath0 lions in two dimensions decays logarithmically slowly as @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in dimensions @xmath2 the capture is unsuccessful as a consequence of the transience of random walks @xcite .",
    "other features considered in predator - prey models include finite life times of the species @xcite or the presence of a third party in the form of a repellent obstructing the predator to reach the prey @xcite .",
    "moreover , three groups of species hunting each other were modelled @xcite , owing to the fact that most animal predators are prey of other animals themselves .",
    "finally , effects of safe havens for prey animals may be considered @xcite .",
    "while such continuum random walk models revealed various interesting results it is clear that the escape and pursuit dynamics is at least partially deterministic , that is , both predator and prey hunt or escape in some sense intelligently . a way to improve the mathematical modelling is to assume that both species can see each other within a certain radius of vision and try to use this as an advantage in the escape and pursuit process @xcite .",
    "in such a model the motion consists of random walks which turn into directed ballistic transport once predator and prey spot each other .",
    "as shown in @xcite the probability to escape can be greatly enhanced if the prey can see the predator and has the possibility to run away . during the pursuit",
    "the prey s movement is superdiffusive . in this scenario",
    "a total of three predators may be necessary to catch a single prey @xcite .",
    "predators may also optimise their search by sharing information @xcite . while the assumption of some level of intelligence certainly makes the model more realistic ,",
    "there is still one aspect that has up to now been ignored .",
    "namely , in reality prey are impenetrable bodies .",
    "thus , in an abundant population of prey ( a lion chasing a herd of antelopes , a wolf charging at a flock of sheep , or a killer cell attacking a bacteria colony or biofilm ) the prey species may obstruct each other while trying to escape .",
    "the self volume ( non - phantom ) constraint greatly influences the single species and collective dynamics of random walkers @xcite leading to qualitative differences in the walkers motion .",
    "therefore , the dynamics and survival probability in predator prey systems at intermediate and higher prey densities is expected to be equally affected .",
    "recently a herd of prey chased by a pack of predators including self volume effects was studied @xcite .",
    "as a result the prey s survival time was found to increase if the prey aim for a specific type of clustering .    in this paper",
    "we study the success of a single predator hunting a flock of prey on a two - dimensional square lattice with periodic boundary conditions taking into account the prey s self volume .",
    "in addition , both species move intelligently in that they can influence their movement by visual perception within their sighting range .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : first we introduce our model .",
    "next we present the numerical and analytical results for the mean first capture time , which is the time the predator needs to catch the first prey , as a function of prey density and the respective sighting ranges .",
    "we find that the mean first capture time as a function of prey density follows a power law .",
    "the ( non - universal ) exponent depends on the sighting ranges of both predator and prey . for the analytical calculations we split the predator s motion into a diffusing part and a ballistic part , representing the search for the prey and the direct chase , respectively .",
    "we then present a study of the mean distance between predator and nearest prey , which is found to decrease exponentially in time . using the mean distance",
    "we show that we can capture its dynamics in terms of a simple ornstein - uhlenbeck process : the relative motion of predator and nearest prey can thus effectively be viewed to be a random process confined by an harmonic potential . neglecting all other prey , the model parameters such as sighting ranges and prey density can be absorbed into the associated spring constant .",
    "to study the success of a single predator hunting a herd of prey we create an agent - based simulation in which predator and prey move on a two dimensional square lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "each species has its specific sighting range @xmath3 in which it can see the other species as depicted in fig [ model ] .",
    "distances as well as sighting ranges are measured as chemical distances @xmath4 of the added bond lengths , with lattice spacing @xmath5 equal to unity .",
    "the predator starts from the centre of the lattice and the prey are initially randomly distributed  excluding the centre of the lattice ",
    "such that the occupancy of a single site is less or equal to a single prey .",
    "predators and prey move with the autonomy of decision in the following sense . if no prey is in the sighting range of the predator and , for a given prey , the predator is not in its sighting range , both participants perform a nearest neighbour random walk .",
    "if a prey comes into the sighting range of the predator , the predator chooses a site randomly , subject to the condition that the distance @xmath6 to the prey necessarily decreases . every lattice site that minimises the distance to the prey",
    "is chosen with the same probability , lattice sites that increase the distance can not be chosen .",
    "analogously , if the predator is spotted the prey chooses a site randomly , subject to the condition that the distance to the predator necessarily increases .",
    "if two or more prey are within the same distance to the predator the latter chooses randomly which prey to pursue . due to the self volume of the prey ,",
    "the prey s motion is restricted . in principle , there exist two possible ways to implement the self volume .",
    "either the prey chooses only from empty sites and always executes a jump as long as there is at least one empty nearest neighbour site . or the prey blindly chooses a nearest neighbour site but only jumps if the chosen site is unoccupied ; otherwise , if it is occupied , the prey retains its location .",
    "we chose the latter scenario , as this appears closer to the situation encountered for confused prey or for moving bacteria . using this update strategy",
    ", we simultaneously choose the individual moves for the prey and the predator . in each round of motion",
    "updates for the prey we randomly choose a sequence of individuals , thus avoiding any bias among individuals @xcite . according to this random sequence we then check whether the individual prey are allowed to jump given the actual positions of all other prey .",
    "the motion of the predator takes into account the positions of all prey at the end of the previous update .",
    "once all inidividual jumps of prey and predator are determined , all positions of the entire predator - prey system are updated simultaneously .",
    "the time unit is chosen arbitrarily and relates to the diffusion constant @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the lattice spacing .",
    "corresponds to the diffusion coefficient for a single prey or predator moving on the lattice . ]",
    "after the individual steps of all participants are accomplished , we check if the predator caught a prey . if the first prey is caught the simulation terminates .",
    "the mean first capture time and the mean distance are obtained from @xmath10 realisations and the first passage density is obtained from @xmath11 runs .",
    "we start by quantifying the success of the predator by computing the mean first capture time @xmath12 , that is , the typical time the predator needs to catch the first prey . in mathematical terms",
    "this corresponds to the prey s survival time .",
    "as one can easily imagine the mean first capture time depends crucially on both sighting ranges @xmath13 and @xmath14 as well as on the prey density @xmath15 , where @xmath0 is the number of prey and @xmath16 is the number of lattice sites .",
    "a higher prey density reduces the prey s survival expectation .",
    "one reason is that the probability that initially one prey sits close to the predator is higher and therefore the prey gets spotted earlier .",
    "the second reason is that a chased prey gets trapped more easily if there are more prey that occupy nearest neighbour sites and therefore lead to a frustration of the prey s mobility .    in this setup",
    "we distinguish two limiting cases : a single prey ( @xmath17 ) with sighting range greater than two can never get caught , its life time is infinite .",
    "conversely , if every lattice spacing is occupied by a prey ( @xmath18 ) then the predator needs exactly one time step to catch the first prey . for arbitrary densities , as a result of extensive simulations we find from fig .",
    "[ fig : capturetime ] that the mean first capture time as a function of the prey density follows a power law behaviour @xmath19 in which different combinations of sighting ranges lead to different slopes .",
    "furthermore , there appears a crossover between two regimes for larger sighting ranges of the prey , in which we find different slopes for the low and intermediate density range and the high density range ; see , for instance , the square symbols in figs .",
    "[ fig : capturetime ] b ) and c ) .    in more detail , while the predator s sighting range only slightly influences the prey s survival , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : capturetime]a ) , the prey can increase their life expectancy significantly by a finite sighting range of at least two , compare fig .",

    "[ fig : capturetime]b ) and [ fig : capturetime]c ) a significant variation at intermediate @xmath3 values is distinct .",
    "we note that a short sighting range of the prey ( @xmath20 ) has no advantage over a vanishing one .",
    "an explanation can be found `` microscopically '' .",
    "there are two possibilities for a prey to get caught .",
    "first , a prey gets stuck and , despite his eyesight , can not evade the encounter with the predator ; or , second , predator and prey simultaneously jump on the same lattice site and collide randomly , see fig .  [",
    "fig : randomcollicion ] . with sighting range zero or one",
    "a prey can not foresee a random collision , because the distance decreases instantly from two to zero .",
    "thus , the prey needs at least a sighting range of two to prevent such a situation .",
    "these random collisions further lead to the fact that the predator is more successful with an even sighting range @xmath21 , @xmath22 being an integer number , than with a higher odd one @xmath23 .",
    "since the random collision is a natural and frequent way to get caught , we decided to eliminate these effects by treating only odd sighting ranges .",
    "= 1 ) , depicted by the red dot , can get caught by the predator ( blue cross ) despite his field of vision by random collision , due to simultaneous jumps to the same lattice site.,width=302 ]    we note that we did not include error bars in our figures .",
    "a stochastic variable with exponential ( poissonian ) probability density function @xmath24 has the mean @xmath25 and variance @xmath26 .",
    "the mean first capture time presented in this section is the first moment of the exponentially distributed first passage density obtained in section [ section_density ] .",
    "the standard deviation of this poissonian process @xmath27 is equal to the mean @xmath25 , which is indeed confirmed from our numerical results with a sample size of @xmath10 per data point .",
    "repeated simulations produced practically indistinguishable results .",
    "in comparison to an ensemble of non - interacting random walkers self volume effects and the autonomy of decision - making of the participants limit the possibilities of analytical calculations .",
    "we succeeded in calculating the distribution of the time for catching the first prey only in the case of blind prey .",
    "as the results are nevertheless instructive we discuss this case here in some detail . the autonomy to switch the mode of motion of the predator can be included by dividing the process into two subprocesses .",
    "the first one describes the diffusing predator while looking out for a prey .",
    "the second subprocess portrays the direct chase of the prey , which can in fact be considered as a ballistic motion in chemical space such that the predator still has the option of choosing sites in different directions .",
    "the first subprocess describes the random motion of the predator while looking out for a prey .",
    "according to the model during that time the predator performs a nearest neighbour random walk on the lattice .",
    "we are interested in the first passage density function of the predator to find the first prey , that is , until the first prey enters the predator s sighting range .",
    "for simplification we use a continuous radial coordinate and ignore the fact that the participants move on a lattice .",
    "we assume that there exists an effective radius @xmath28 around the predator in which he will not encounter a prey .",
    "this radius has a natural lower bound which is the initial distance between predator and nearest prey ( at time @xmath29 ) , calculated in section [ meandistanceanalytics ] .",
    "if the predator hits this effective radius , he spots the prey and will from there on switch his motion to the direct chase calculated in the next subsection .",
    "we consider the predator as a diffusing particle in two dimensions and calculate his first passage time to escape a sphere with radius @xmath30 . for simplification",
    "we let the particle diffuse between concentric spheres with an inner reflecting boundary at radius @xmath31 , which will later tend to zero , and an outer absorbing boundary at radius @xmath32 , representing the point where the predator spots a prey .",
    "@xmath32 is thus the distance between predator and prey minus the sighting range of the predator .",
    "the predator starts inside the interval @xmath33",
    ". we will later let @xmath34 tend to @xmath31 to capture the predator s starting position correctly .",
    "the diffusing particle can be described by the radial diffusion equation @xmath35 for the probability density function @xmath36 to find the predator at radius @xmath37 at time @xmath38 .",
    "the initial condition we choose as @xmath39 , that is , the particle starts at @xmath40 .",
    "we impose the absorbing boundary condition @xmath41 at @xmath32 and the reflecting boundary condition @xmath42_{r_-}=0 $ ] at @xmath43 .",
    "after laplace transform @xmath44 and with @xmath45 the diffusion equation is reduced to the ordinary differential equation @xmath46 for @xmath47 and @xmath48 this is the modified bessel equation of zero order with known solution @xmath49 for @xmath50 @xcite , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the modified bessel functions of first and second kind .",
    "we solve this equation by imposing the continuity condition @xmath53 and the jump - discontinuity @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the solution in the range @xmath47 and @xmath56 is the solution in the range @xmath48 . with the shorthand notations",
    "@xmath57 and @xmath58 @xcite the solution yields in the form @xmath59 if the particle starts at the inner boundary @xmath60 , corresponding to @xmath61 in the reduced coordinates , @xmath62 we calculate the flux through the outer boundary as @xmath63 when @xmath61 approaches zero , we therefore find that @xmath64 where on the right hand side we restored the original variables .",
    "this is but the first passage time density function in laplace space of the predator to spot a prey . from that time",
    "the predator will chase the prey directly , this part being calculated in the next subsection .",
    "the second subprocess , which describes the predator s movement from the moment of spotting the prey until the prey is caught , can be reduced to a one - dimensional problem .",
    "remember that the decision for every step of the predator is constrained by the following rule : the distance to the prey has to necessarily decrease .",
    "for the prey , analogously , the goal is to increase the distance .",
    "consequently after a combined predator and prey step the distance between predator and prey can either stay the same or decrease by one lattice spacing if the chosen site of the prey is already occupied and the prey remains at its site .",
    "the first capture time can thus be calculated exactly from the number of times a prey remains at its location .",
    "a large sighting range of the prey renders the analysis of the chasing process more difficult as all prey try to escape from the predator and will eventually build a cluster that moves away from the predator . due to the random order of the updates , one can not say which of the prey remains sitting .",
    "therefore , we confine ourselves to the case of blind prey . in this case",
    "the prey undergoes normal diffusion and the predator moves constantly towards the prey .",
    "we therefore consider the predator to be a moving cliff towards a diffusing particle , the blind prey .",
    "the survival probability of a diffusing particle in presence of a ballistically moving cliff decays exponentially @xcite , @xmath65 the associated first passage density @xmath66 then becomes @xmath67 with the laplace transform @xmath68 in the long time limit corresponding to a small @xmath69 expansion , we finally get @xmath70 .    using the first passage time densities of the subprocesses of search and chase we calculate the total first capture time density function in the next subsection .      the distribution of the first capture time is now given by the convolution of results @xmath71 and @xmath70 , @xmath72 which designates the probability that the predator spots the first prey at time @xmath73 and catches the prey during the time span @xmath74 . in laplace space this convolution simplifies to the product @xmath75 .",
    "the inverse laplace transform can be obtained in the long time limit , corresponding to taking @xmath76 .",
    "we thus need to invert @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "taking the leading terms for small @xmath69 , @xmath80 with @xmath81 , the inverse laplace transform yields the final result , @xmath82 this density of first capture is thus an exponential distribution , where the rate @xmath83 is a function of the prey density and the predator s sighting range .",
    "[ fp ] shows the numerical data of our simulation for the case of blind prey and a short sighting range of the predator ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "the exponential form ( [ eq_scaling_density ] ) agrees quite well with the data over the whole density range .",
    "we now turn to study the dynamics of the mean distance between the predator and the nearest prey in more detail . in fig .",
    "[ meandistance ] our simulation results for this mean distance are plotted for a low prey density @xmath85 in the upper row ( panels a ) , c ) and e ) ) and for an intermediate density @xmath86 in the lower row ( panels b ) , d ) and f ) ) .",
    "the distance decreases exponentially in time except for the case when a blind predator is combined with a low prey density ( fig .",
    "[ meandistance ] a ) ) or with a very good eye - sight of the prey ( fig .",
    "[ meandistance ] b ) ) . in these cases",
    "the distance is approximately constant in the shown time window . in case of identical",
    "sighting ranges the distance between short - sighted species decreases faster than the distance between blind species .",
    "this phenomenon is due to the random collisions explained in section [ section_mfct ] .",
    "as intuitively expected , the distance between the predator and the nearest prey decreases faster in the case of a large sighting range of the predator .",
    "however when the prey s sighting range is large it softens the decay of the distance .",
    "a high prey density also leads to a faster decay of the distance between the predator and the nearest prey , because it implies more prey - prey obstruction events for the chased prey , and with every one such event the distance is reduced by one lattice spacing .    a naive model that captures the effective interaction between two diffusive particles such as the predator and the nearest prey turns out to be the ornstein - uhlenbeck process @xcite .",
    "it is defined in terms of the stochastic differential equation @xmath87 with non - negative parameters @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 .",
    "@xmath91 denotes the wiener process @xcite .",
    "the ornstein - uhlenbeck process describes the relaxation of the variable @xmath92 with initial value @xmath93 to the mean value @xmath94 in the presence of gaussian white noise .",
    "the first moment is given by the exponential decay @xmath95+x_0\\exp(-ct).\\ ] ] comparing the first moment to the observed simulated decay of the mean distance between the predator and the nearest prey ( fig .",
    "[ meandistance ] ) , @xmath96 we see that the mean distance decreases as a special case of the ornstein - uhlenbeck process with vanishing excentricity parameter , @xmath97 .",
    "a popular application of the ornstein - uhlenbeck process in physics is a hookean spring with spring constant @xmath98 , whose dynamics is highly overdamped with friction coefficient @xmath99 in the presence of thermal fluctuations .",
    "therefore we can imagine the predator and the nearest prey to be connected by a hookean spring and being driven by an external wiener noise .",
    "the corresponding mean relaxes to zero .",
    "the equilibrium length of the spring is therefore zero .",
    "the bottom of the corresponding harmonic potential thus represents the capture of the prey by the predator . due to the analogy",
    ", the respective sighting ranges and the prey density affect the stiffness of the spring .",
    "the spring constant is easily related to the decay rate @xmath100 of the mean distance , @xmath101 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ springconstants ] the fitted values for the spring constant display the power law behaviour @xmath102 the spring constant corresponds to the slopes of the functions in fig .",
    "[ meandistance ] , extracted from the exponential fit and plotted as a function of the prey density .",
    "it relates to the mean first capture time discussed in section [ section_mfct ] in the following way .",
    "the exponential decay of the mean distance between predator and nearest prey has a mean life time related to the decay rate @xmath103 since the nearest prey is the one that will get caught , its mean first capture time is related to the mean life time of the mean distance and consequently to the inverse of the decay rate , compare figs .",
    "[ fig : capturetime ] and [ springconstants ] .",
    "we finally mention an analytical approximation for the distance between the predator and the nearest prey . since we want to capture the whole dynamics we first need to determine the initial distance between predator and nearest prey at time @xmath29 . in the simulation",
    "we place the predator in the centre and place the prey randomly around him including the self volume interaction",
    ". then we measure the distance between the predator and the nearest prey . in section [ searching ]",
    "we used an effective radius @xmath104 within which the predator does not encounter a prey .",
    "although we can not calculate this effective radius a natural lower bound is the initial mean distance @xmath105 between the predator and the nearest prey . within this distance",
    "there is no prey present and therefore it is impossible for the predator to encounter a prey .",
    "we determine the initial distance between the predator and the nearest prey on a square lattice with edge length @xmath106 .",
    "the predator sits in the centre of the lattice and the prey are randomly distributed on the remaining @xmath107 sites . as the prey have a self volume , a lattice site can only be occupied by a single prey .",
    "the probability for the distance between predator and nearest prey @xmath108 to be equal to @xmath6 is @xmath109 we then calculate the probability @xmath110 using combinatorics .",
    "the detailed calculation can be found in appendix a. for the probability function of the distance between predator and nearest prey we obtain @xmath111\\big/\\sum\\limits _ { i=1}^{d_{\\mathrm{max}}}{n_r(d_i ) \\choose n_p } , \\label{eq_pdf_initial}\\ ] ] where we define @xmath112 as the maximal possible distance between the predator and the nearest prey .",
    "the expectation value of the initial distance from the predator to the nearest prey , @xmath113 then yields in the form @xmath114    the probability distribution of the initial distance to the nearest prey is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_dmin ] and the related initial mean distance as a function of prey density can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_meandistance ] .",
    "we simulated both the initial distance distribution and the initial mean distance between the predator and the nearest prey by placing all participants on the lattice under the model conditions with @xmath10 iterations .",
    "both analytical and numerical results show excellent agreement in figs .",
    "[ fig_dmin ] and [ fig_meandistance ] .",
    "we studied the predator - prey dynamics of a single predator hunting a herd of prey on a square lattice with decision - making species .",
    "while many predator - prey models deal with collective predation @xcite or the search for the optimal number of predators given the number of prey @xcite , we chose a model consisting of one predator and many prey , which is often found in nature .",
    "solitary hunters such as tigers , bears , or sea turtles often have herd animals as their target .",
    "a tiger , for example , hunts a herd of antelopes or a flock of sheep , a bear fishing a salmon out of a swarm , or sea turtles eating jellyfish , shrimp , and fish living in schools .",
    "similarly individual killer cells in biological organisms may attack a colony of bacteria or a biofilm .",
    "a major ingredient of our model is the self volume of the prey , such that no two prey are allowed on a given lattice site .",
    "we showed that in the case of impenetrable prey the predator hunts more successfully if the prey have worse eyesight .",
    "moreover , we found that the predator benefits more from a deterioration of the prey s eyesight than from an improvement of his own eyesight .",
    "while trapping reaction models obtain a minor influence of the prey s long time survival probability by their diffusion constant @xcite we found the prey s sighting range and thereby motion predominating their survival probability . due to self volume interactions the prey are forced to improve their eye - sight , and with a good field of vision can drastically increase their chances of survival even in the range of high densities .",
    "the prey only profit from a sighting range of at least two .",
    "a very short eyesight does not at all improve its survival probability with respect to being blind .",
    "this is attributed to random collisions between predator and prey . using a simplified analytic approach we showed that in the long time limit the first passage density of the predator to catch a blind prey decays exponentially in time with a non - linear dependence of the decay rate on the prey density .",
    "the effective motion during the chase ( described in terms of the distance between the predator and the chased prey ) can be effectively described as a linear relaxation process in an harmonic potential with a stochastic driving where the density and sighting ranges determine the stiffness of the corresponding hookean spring .",
    "all non - linear effects entering the motion due to self volume interactions can thus effectively be described with a single parameter .",
    "there exist a range of further open questions . to imitate natural environment one could extend the dynamics by introducing ( time or sighting range dependent ) waiting times",
    ". one could choose different rates of motion for predator and prey as well or even distribute the rates within the prey to simulate old , sick or infant animals .",
    "additionally , many prey live in herds , so one could let the prey be clustered as the initial condition .",
    "last but not least , communication between the prey is a reasonable thing to assume .",
    "once one of the prey spots the predator , immediately all of them are informed ( similar to stamping of rabbits or the cheeping calls of groundhogs ) , that is , a collective response of prey .",
    "we finally note that random search processes with non - brownian search dynamics are also widely discussed in literature .",
    "while brownian motion is an advantageous process to find nearby targets @xcite , it is known that pure stochastic motion leads to oversampling of the area on longer time scales .",
    "hence , the optimal number of encounters with prey can be found by switching between search modes @xcite .",
    "representative for such a process is for example the intermittent search strategy which combines phases of slow motion , allowing the searcher to detect the target , and phases of fast motion during which targets can not be detected @xcite .",
    "another widely applicable process concerning optimal search strategies are lvy flights , which are based on random walk processes with long- tailed jump length distributions and are known to be an efficient strategy for finding a target of unknown place @xcite . a species which is known to move in lvy patterns are wandering albatrosses @xcite or marine predators as sharks , bony fishes , sea turtles and penguins @xcite .",
    "it would thus be interesting to study effects of self volume in these models as well .",
