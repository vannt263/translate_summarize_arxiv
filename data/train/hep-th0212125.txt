    "we investigate the fermionic zero modes on magnetic vortices in supersymmetric ( susy ) @xmath0 qed with two hypermultiplets of opposite charge .",
    "this model was proposed as a toy model for the low energy limit of type - ii superstrings compactified on calabi  yau manifolds , where the possibility of magnetic vortices was first suggested in @xcite ( in the full low energy theory , there are sixteen hypermultiplets charged under fifteen u(1 ) groups , that is , fifteen copies of the model studied here ) .    in the absence of fayet  iliopoulos terms , it was proved in @xcite that the strings appearing in that model are unstable . in @xcite the present authors studied the case where a ( gauge ) symmetry breaking fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) term was added . in this case",
    "we found bps string solutions .",
    "we also found that out of all the possible vacua , only certain choices can give rise to static strings , due to a _ vacuum selection _ effect @xcite .",
    "even so , this effect was still not enough to obtain stable strings , unlike in the case of a comparable @xmath1 supersymmetric model with two chiral multiplets @xcite .",
    "the strings formed are semilocal strings @xcite , and in the bps limit ( equal scalar and gauge masses ) they are only neutrally stable @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "a study of the possible fermionic zero modes arising in this model has been carried out , in order to see whether they stabilise the string by further augmenting the vacuum selection effect .",
    "if this were so , the semilocal strings could possibly turn into chiral cosmic strings @xcite , long - lived vortices in which the fermions move in one direction only .",
    "however we have found that this is not the case .",
    "the fermions respect the same vacuum selection effect as the bosons , meaning that the underlying string remains semilocal .",
    "moreover , the fermions move in both directions along the string , and therefore they could mix and leave the string .",
    "it is known that the fermion back - reaction can modify the stability of the background string @xcite .",
    "we argue that this is not the case in the present context , because , unlike the systems studied in @xcite , the bogomolnyi bound is protected by the remnant unbroken susy .",
    "the `` topological charge '' is identical for all the vortices in the family , and we do not expect any member of the family to be singled out by the fermion back - reaction .    nevertheless , we have found that , due to the bosonic zero mode of the semilocal string , one of the fermions is coupled to a boson which is not zero at the core of the string , contrary to what might be expected from related assertions in the literature . to our knowledge",

    "the fermions at infinity have masses @xmath103 , which agree with the masses of the fields @xmath104 , as should be the case since supersymmetry is unbroken there .",
    "we have studied the fermion zero modes arising in susy @xmath0 qed with two hypermultiplets and a fi term .",
    "it is known that in such a model there is a vacuum selection effect in the bosonic sector , and only some of all the possible vacua form a family of neutrally stable vortices @xcite .",
    "we showed that the fermion zero modes do not improve the stability of the vortices .",
    "this is due to the fact that fermions obey the same vacuum selection effect as the vortices . on the other hand ,",
    "as the susy is @xmath0 , fermions with both chiralities are present in the vortex .",
    "we do not expect the stability to be altered by the back - reaction of the fermions either .",

    "the model analysed in this paper contains a family of vortices that have the same topological charge , and all saturate the bogomolnyi bound .",
    "susy is half broken for all members of the family , and the unbroken susy will preserve the bogomolnyi bound in all cases , since the multiplets are shortened .",
    "thus the bps condition holds for all members of the family , and as they all have the same topological charge , the energy of all of them is also the same .",
    "thus , no member of the family will be singled out by fermionic back - reaction .",
    "the fermions in this system are also interesting because some are coupled to a scalar field which is not zero at the core of the vortex .",
    "it is sometimes stated in the literature that the reason why vortices support fermion zero modes in their core is because the fermion masses , which come from coupling to the scalars , are zero there .",
    "we have shown here that this heuristic argument is incorrect by calculating explicitly the zero modes that couple to the non  zero scalar at the core ( @xmath31 , if the string is in @xmath105 ) .",
    "it is interesting to try to relate the zero modes derived from supersymmetry to the zero modes we see in the equations of motion .",
    "the two fermionic zero modes obtained directly from supersymmetry are related to translational zero modes in the bosonic sector .",
    "we can see from the second order equations of motion that in fact there are two more fermionic zero modes : in the bosonic sector , there are zero modes corresponding to changes in the parameter @xmath27 of the semilocal string , expanding the string core .",
    "this bosonic zero mode corresponds to the fermionic zero modes that have negative mass at zero , and which are massless at infinity .",
    "one way to see this is to take the case where there is just one hypermultiplet @xmath106 .",
    "the string formed would then be an ordinary nielsen - olesen string , which would not possess the bosonic zero mode .",
    "furthermore , the spinors @xmath107 and @xmath108 would disappear , and the remaining eigenstates would have signs @xmath109 for their masses squared at zero and @xmath110 at infinity , so that only two of the eigenstates are non - zero . when we re - introduce the second hypermultiplet , the extra fermionic zero modes correspond to the extra bosonic zero mode associated with @xmath31 .",
    "it is also possible to consider supersymmetric transformations of the bosonic zero mode to give the fermionic zero mode .",
    "we perturb the field @xmath31 , adjusting the other fields so that we retain the bogomolnyi equations ( [ bogomolnyi ] ) , and hence keep the same energy . in the limit @xmath111 , the semilocal string has @xmath112 , and an infinitesimal perturbation of @xmath31 of the form @xmath113 does not modify the other fields .",
    "hence , a supersymmetry transformation of this zero mode gives fermionic zero modes in @xmath71 and @xmath72 only .    at infinity the bosonic zero mode corresponding to changing the string width is a goldstone boson , and this agrees with what we have discovered from the fermionic equations of motion : that the eigenstates that have mass zero at infinity are pure @xmath71 or @xmath72 in the @xmath28 case .",
    "for a general semilocal string @xmath114 , all the bosonic fields will be affected by a perturbation in the string width , and so the corresponding fermionic zero modes are combinations of each set of three spinors .",
    "we note that the index theorem of davis , davis and perkins @xcite does not apply in the case of the semilocal string due to the fact that one of the fields does nt wind in the core  an assumption made in the derivation of the index theorem .",
    "hence we ca nt use it to ascertain the number of zero modes in this case . in the case where the index theorem does apply , namely the nielsen ",
    "olesen string ( i.e. one hypermultiplet ) , our results agree with the index theorem . for the semilocal string",
    "there are two extra zero modes corresponding to the change of the string width ; the fermion zero modes are those fermions corresponding to the bosonic zero mode .",
    "this has been constructed explicitly in the nielsen ",
    "olesen limit of the semilocal string .",
    "the model also falls outside the scope of the index theorem of ganoulis and lazarides@xcite , because @xmath31 is charged under @xmath10 but goes to zero at infinity .",
    "our results agree with weinberg s index theorem@xcite ( see also @xcite ) , since the new zero modes have opposite chiralities and therefore do not affect the counting of net ( left minus right ) fermion zero modes .",
