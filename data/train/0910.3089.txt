    "recent measurements of @xmath0-meson mass and lifetime in cdf @xcite and d0 @xcite experiments allow us to hope that more detailed investigation of this particle on lhc collider , where about @xmath7 @xmath0-events per year are expected , would clarify mechanisms of @xmath0 production and decay modes .",
    "currently only products of @xmath0-meson production cross section and branching fractions of decays @xmath8 , @xmath9 are known experimentally .",
    "for example , the following ratios are measured @xcite:@xmath10 for positron in the final state and@xmath11 for muon .",
    "these ratios are about an order of magnitude higher than the theoretical predictions based on current estimates of @xmath0-meson production cross section and branching fraction @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the mode @xmath8 was used mainly to determine precisely @xmath0-meson mass .",
    "no information on production cross section , decay branching fraction , and even the product of these quantities was determined in this experiment .",
    "investigation of other @xmath0-meson decay channels and determination of their branching fractions will be one of interesting tasks of future experiments on lhc .",
    "weak @xmath0 decays can be caused by decays of both constituent quarks .",
    "dominant are @xmath13-quark decay modes , which amount to @xmath14 of all @xmath0-meson decays .",
    "unfortunately , none of such reactions were observed , although large branching fractions are expected for some of these decay modes ( for example , for @xmath15 we have approximately 16% branching fraction ) .",
    "mentioned above decays @xmath16 and @xmath8 are examples of other class , caused by @xmath17-quark decay .",
    "total branching fraction of this process is about 20% .    in the present paper",
    "we will fill the gap in existing theoretical predictions of @xmath0-meson decay branching fractions @xcite and consider multi - particle processes @xmath1 with @xmath4 .",
    "these reactions are caused by weak @xmath17-quark decay @xmath18 and clean analogy with similar @xmath19-lepton decays ( @xmath20 ) can be easily seen .",
    "this analogy allows us to use existing experimental data on @xmath19-lepton decays and give reliable predictions of @xmath1 branching fractions .    in the next section",
    "we give analytical expressions for distributions of @xmath1 decays branching fractions over invariant mass of the light hadron system and study different asymmetries of final @xmath21-meson polarization as a function of this kinematic variable . in section",
    "iii we use existing experimental data on @xmath19-lepton decays calculate branching fractions of @xmath1 decays for @xmath4 . in section",
    "iv inclusive reaction @xmath22 is considered in connection with duality relation .",
    "short results of our work are given in the final section .",
    "@xmath23-meson decays into light hadrons with vector charmonium @xmath21 production are caused by @xmath17-quark decay @xmath24 ( see diagram shown in fig.[fig : diag ] ) .",
    "the effective lagrangian of the latter process reads @xmath25,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is fermi coupling constant , @xmath27 are the elements of ckm mixing matrix , @xmath28 are wilson coefficients , that take into account higher qcd corrections and operators @xmath29 are defined according to @xmath30 in this expression @xmath31 are color indexes of quarks and @xmath32 . since in our decays light quark pair should be in color - singlet state , the amplitude of the considered here processes is proportional to @xmath33\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if qcd corrections are neglected , one should set @xmath34 . leading logarithmic strong corrections lead to dependence of this coefficient on the renormalization scale @xmath35 @xcite , and on @xmath36",
    "it is equal to @xmath37      the matrix element of the decay @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is some set of light hadrons , has the form @xmath40 & = &       \\frac{g_{f}v_{cb}}{\\sqrt{2}}a_1\\mathcal{h}^{\\mu}\\epsilon_{\\mu}^{\\mathcal{r}}.\\label{eq : matr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this expression @xmath41 is the effective polarization vector of virtual @xmath42-boson and          where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the momenta of @xmath0- and @xmath21-mesons , @xmath47 is the momentum of virtual @xmath42-boson , and @xmath48 , @xmath49 are form - factors of @xmath50 decay . due to vector current conservation and partial axial current conservation the contribution of the form - factor @xmath51 are suppressed by small factor @xmath52 , so we will neglect it in the following .",
    "one can use different approaches when deriving the form of the form - factors @xmath53 .",
    "first of all , it is clear , that quark velocity in heavy quarkonia is small in comparison with @xmath13 , so one can describe heavy quarkonia in the terms of non - relativistic wave - functions .",
    "this fact was used on the so called quark models @xcite . in the following",
    "we will refer to this set of form - factors as _",
    "qm_.the speed of the final charmonium in @xmath0-meson rest frame , on the other hand , is large , so one can expand the amplitude of the considered here process in the powers of small parameter @xmath54 , as it was done in papers @xcite . in what follows , we will refer to this set of form - factors as _",
    "lc_. one can also use 3-point qcd sum rules to obtain the information on @xmath50form - factors @xcite ( _ sr _ ) .",
    "the other interesting point are the polarization asymmetries of final @xmath21-meson . in the framework of factorization model these asymmetries",
    "do not depend on the final state @xmath39 , so one can use them to investigate form - factors of @xmath0-meson and to test the factorization theorem . in our paper",
    "we present the polarization degree @xmath58 and transverse polarization asymmetry @xmath59 for different sets of form - factors .",
