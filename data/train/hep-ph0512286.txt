    "the spin dependent structure functions of the nucleon are the subject of much theoretical and experimental interest .",
    "the main reason for this interest has been the large amount of evidence , starting with the emc experiment @xcite which strongly suggests that constituent quark models can not fully describe the spin structure of protons and neutrons .",
    "this has lead to considerable activity in order to determine how the spin of nucleons is built up from the intrinsic spin and orbital angular momentum of their constituent quarks and gluons .    since 1988",
    "further polarised deep inelastic scattering experiments have generally confirmed the emc results for the proton - photon asymmetry @xmath3 and proton spin structure function @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "these measurements have also been performed on deuteron and neutron targets @xcite , which has enabled the bjorken sum rule @xcite to be tested at the five per cent level .",
    "in addition , there have been measurements , using transversely polarised targets , of the second nucleon - photon asymmetries @xmath4 and the related structure functions @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 structure functions are of interest because they do not have a simple interpretation in the quark - parton model , but are related to transverse momentum of quarks and higher twist operators which measure correlations between quarks and gluons .",
    "the identification of a higher twist component in a measurement of @xmath6 would be significant as this would give new information on the gluon field inside the nucleon , and its relationship with the quark fields .",
    "recently new experimental approaches have sought to augment the information available from deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiments .",
    "these include semi - inclusive polarised dis ( hermes and compass ) , polarised proton - proton collisions ( rhic ) and polarised photoproduction .",
    "there have been a number of theoretical approaches to calculating @xmath0 and @xmath1 using phenomenological models of nucleon structure such as the mit bag model @xcite and the chiral soliton model @xcite .",
    "in addition there have been lattice calculations of some of the nucleon matrix elements of operators corresponding to small moments of the structure functions @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we shall use the meson cloud model ( mcm ) to calculate the spin dependent structure functions of the nucleon .",
    "this model has been applied successfully in spin independent dis , giving a good description of the hera data on semi - inclusive dis with a leading neutron @xcite , and also dijet events with a leading neutron @xcite .",
    "in addition the mcm gives a good description of the observed violation @xcite of the gottfried sum rule @xcite .",
    "the meson cloud model ( mcm ) has been used previously to calculate @xmath0 @xcite . in those calculations",
    "pseudoscalar mesons were identified as the main constituents of the meson cloud . while these mesons do not directly contribute to the structure function , the presence of the cloud transfers some angular momentum from the quarks in the ` bare ' proton to the meson cloud and results in a decrease in the calculated first moment of @xmath7 compared to the mit bag model .",
    "more recently it has been realised that vector mesons , particularly the @xmath8 , can also play a role in the spin structure of the proton @xcite .",
    "in particular these will give rise to flavour symmetry breaking in the sea , and the @xmath9 difference has been calculated by a number of authors @xcite .",
    "interestingly these calculations predict that the spin dependent symmetry breaking is quite small , in contrast to the spin independent symmetry breaking combination @xmath10 which is observed to be large .",
    "recently these calculations were extended to the spin dependent sea distributions ( @xmath11 ) @xcite , and were found to be in good agreement with the recent results from hermes @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the earlier calculations of @xmath12 in light of the developments in the mcm since that time .",
    "we also extend the calculations of structure functions using the mcm to @xmath6 , and investigate the kinematic regions where it may be possible to observe a twist-3 piece of the structure functions .",
    "in section 2 of this paper we present the formalism for discussing spin dependent structure functions in the meson cloud model , including a discussion of the kinematic terms which lead to @xmath13 of cloud components contributing to @xmath2 of the nucleon ( and vice versa ) @xcite .",
    "contributions to the structure functions from interference between different states of the cloud @xcite are discussed in section 3 , and it is shown that most of the leading interference contributions vanish . in section 4",
    "we apply the mcm formalism and determine all the necessary momentum distributions of the components of the meson cloud .",
    "we also discuss the correct prescription to use in describing the energy of the intermediate state hadrons in the mcm . in section 5",
    "we calculate the spin dependent structure functions of the baryons and mesons in the cloud using the mit bag model .",
    "the numerical results for the nucleon structure functions are shown and discussed in section 6 . in the last section we summarise our findings",
    "in the lab frame the cross section for inclusive inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering may be written in terms of the product of lepton and hadron tensors = l _ w^ where @xmath14 is the fine structure constant , @xmath15 is the energy of the incident ( scattered ) lepton and @xmath16 is the squared four - momentum transfer . in spin",

    "we see that the nucleon structure functions pick up contributions from both @xmath62 and @xmath63 of the baryon in the cloud .",
    "this occurs because the spin vector of the cloud baryon @xmath64 is not parallel to the initial nucleon spin vector @xmath22 .",

    "eq : dgs ]      the analysis for spin 1 mesons exactly follows that above for spin 1/2 baryons , and was given by kumano and miyama @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is that the most general form of the antisymmetric part of the meson tensor is the same for spin 1 mesons as for spin 1/2 baryons @xcite .",

    "this is not necessarily true in a covariant approach @xcite , which leads to non - conservation of charge and momentum .",
    "however a problem arises in topt when the vertex contains derivative coupling between fields ( e.g. the usual pseudovector @xmath178 vertex contains a term proportional to @xmath179 where @xmath180 is the nucleon field and @xmath181 is the vector field ) , as these terms introduce off - shell dependence into the vertex function which is not suppressed in the imf .",
    "this leads to two possible choices for the meson energy : a ) the on - shell meson energy @xmath182 , or b ) the off - shell meson energy , i.e. the difference between baryon energies @xmath183 .",
    "while the second choice may be more ` natural ' in that the vertex structure is only due to baryonic currents @xcite , the first appears more compatible with topt in that the meson remains on - shell . in practice",
    "a number of authors @xcite have used both prescriptions , and treated them as two different models .",
    "we can gain some insight into the choice of meson energy if we recall that topt in the imf is equivalent to light - cone perturbation theory ( lcpt ) @xcite .",
    "in lcpt it is important to be aware of the light - cone singularities in the particle propagators . for spin zero particles the klein - gordon propagator ( in light - cone co - ordinates )",
    "is @xcite _ f(x ) = d^2p _ _ 0^ .",
    "the singularity at @xmath184 does not affect the light - cone behaviour of the propagator , which is governed by the light - cone discontinuities @xmath185 . for particles of higher spin",
    ", the propagators all pick up terms proportional to ( x^+ ) d^2p _ _ -^ in addition to the terms proportional to @xmath185 .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath186 is an instantaneous part of the propagator .",
    "this term can be absorbed into the regular propagator by replacing in the numerator of the diagrams in which the particle propagates over a single time interval , the momentum @xmath187 associated with the line by = ( p^+ , _ incp^- - _",
    "intp^- , ) where @xmath188 sums over all the initial particles in the diagram and @xmath189 sums over all the particles in the intermediate state _ except _ the particle of interest @xcite . returning to topt in the imf",
    ", we see that this is equivalent to choice b for the meson energy , for non - scalar mesons . for spin - zero mesons",
    "there are no terms corresponding to instantaneous propagation ( in light - cone co - ordinates ) , and the propagator is not adjusted .",
    "hence for scalar and pseudoscalar mesons the correct meson energy is choice a , i.e. the mesons are always treated as on - shell .",
    "the vertex function @xmath190 is calculated from the effective interaction lagrangians ( see appendix b ) which are usually employed in the meson exchange models @xcite .",
    "phenomenological vertex form factors @xmath191 are also introduced into equation ( [ eq : jnmb ] ) to describe the unknown dynamics of the fluctuation @xmath192 arising from the extended structure of hadrons .",
    "we use the exponential form factor g_bm(y , k_^2)=exp , [ eq : gbm ] with @xmath193 being a cut - off parameter , which is well defined in the model and provides a cut - off in both @xmath194 and @xmath195 ( the four momentum squared of the intermediate baryon ) .",
    "the form factor satisfies the relation @xmath196 .",
    "using form factors introduces new parameters @xmath197 into any calculation using the mcm , with each fock state having ( in principle ) its own cut - off .",
    "however the jlich group @xcite and zoller @xcite used high - energy particle production data to determine all the @xmath193 of interest , and found that the data could be described by two parameters : @xmath198 for octet baryons and pseudoscalar and vector mesons , and @xmath199 for decuplet baryons .",
    "the upper limits for these two parameters were determined to be about 1 gev , which is fairly soft , and gives the probability of all fock states totalling to about 40% .",
    "melnitchouk , speth and thomas @xcite found a good fit to both the violation of the gottfried sum rule @xcite and the observed ratio of @xmath200 from the e866 experiment @xcite using values @xmath201 gev and @xmath202 gev , and we shall use these values of the cut - offs in this work .",
    "the fock states we consider are @xmath203 , @xmath204 , @xmath205 , and @xmath159 .",
    "the coupling constants and probabilities for each of these states in the nucleon wavefunction are shown in tables   [ table : couplings ] and [ table : cutoffs ] .",
    "the effect of increasing one or both cut - offs is to increase the probability for the states controlled by the cut - off , and correspondingly decrease the probability of finding the ` bare ' nucleon .",
    "also the probability for higher mass fock states increases faster with the cut - off than the probability for lower mass states , so increasing e.g. @xmath198 increases the ratio of @xmath204 states to @xmath203 states .",
    "the contributions from fock states involving higher invariant mass squared are very small , at most a few percent of the contributions from the states we consider here . in figures  [ fig : dfnpi ]  [ fig : dfrhod ] we show the fluctuation functions @xmath206 for each of the fock states . in each of these calculations we take @xmath207 and @xmath208 gev@xmath209 , i.e. @xmath210 . in general",
    "we see that the longitudinal functions @xmath211 are much larger that the transverse functions @xmath212 .",
    "this means that the contributions to @xmath13 of the nucleon coming from @xmath2 of the struck hadron will be small , whereas the kinematic contributions to @xmath2 of the nucleon from @xmath13 of the struck hadron should not be ignored as they will generally be larger than the contributions coming from @xmath2 of the fock state hadrons .",
    "we also observe that the fluctuation functions arising from @xmath213 states are generally much larger than those of the other fock states we consider .",
    "amplitudes with the @xmath114 having @xmath214 are particularly important .",
    "we therefore expect that the @xmath213 fluctuation will play a very important role in the mcm contributions to the spin structure functions .",
    "fluctuation functions involving @xmath8 mesons should not be neglected either , as these are of similar size to the @xmath215 fluctuation functions .",
    "to use the meson cloud model we need to know the polarized structure functions of all the baryons and mesons in the fock expansion of the nucleon wavefunction . at present",
    "the only polarized structure functions that are known experimentally are those of the proton and neutron ( apart from the trivial case of the pseudoscalar or scalar mesons ) .",
    "it would appear unlikely that the structure functions of the @xmath8 mesons and the @xmath114 baryons , which are the most important polarized cloud constituents , will be measured in the near future .",
    "our approach therefore is to estimate all the structure functions we require , including those of the nucleons , using the mit bag model @xcite and the methods developed by the adelaide group @xcite and ourselves @xcite .",
    "this approach gives a reasonable description of the unpolarized structure functions of the nucleons when compared to experimental data .    in the bag model the dominant contributions to the parton distribution functions of a hadron in the medium-@xmath60 range come from intermediate states with the lowest number of quarks , so the intermediate states we consider contain one quark ( or anti - quark ) for the mesons and two quarks for the baryons .",
    "following @xcite we can write these contributions as q_h , f^(x ) = _ m | p_f , m| d*p*_n ( m_h(1-x ) - p_n^+ ) |^_+,f(*p*_n)|^2 , [ mit2q ] where @xmath216 is the hadron mass , ` + ' components of momenta are defined by @xmath217 , and @xmath218 is the 3-momentum of the intermediate state .",

    "the input parameters in the bag model calculations are the bag radius @xmath230 , the mass of the quark ( anti - quark ) @xmath231 for which the parton distribution is calculated , the mass of the intermediate state @xmath232 , and the bag scale @xmath233  at this scale the model is taken as a good approximation to the valence structure of the hadron .",
    "the natural scale for the model is set by the typical quark @xmath147 , which is around 0.4 gev . in table  [ table : bag ] we list the values for these parameters adopted in this work .",
    "these values have previously been shown to give a good description of the unpolarized nucleon parton distributions @xcite and also of the meson distributions @xcite .",
    "after calculating the hadron structure functions at the bag scale @xmath233 , we evolve them using nlo evolution @xcite to the scale of @xmath208 gev@xmath209 where the hermes results for @xmath234 @xcite and @xmath235 @xcite are available . while nlo evolution from the bag scale appears stable",
    ", it would be of interest to compare with nnlo evolution , as it is known that lo evolution does not give very good results for this procedure @xcite .",

    "the importance of these polarized gluon contributions is more obvious in the calculation of the structure function @xmath235 . without these contributions our theoretical calculations are not able to reproduce the shape of the experimental data .",
    "we note that the magnitude of the polarized gluon distribution we use is determined only by the ellis - jaffe sum rule , and we have not attempted to change the shape of the distribution to improve the agreement with the data",
    ". a harder polarized gluon distribution would reduce @xmath7 even more at large @xmath60 .",
    "another factor which affects the quality of our fit to the data at large @xmath60 is the difficulty the bag model calculation of structure functions has in this region because of the non - relativistic projection used to form momentum eigenstates @xcite , which results in the calculated distributions being systematically smaller than the data .",
    "the values for the ellis - jaffe sum rule for the proton and neutron are found to be @xmath257 and @xmath258 respectively , which are close to the experimental values at this scale of @xmath259 ( stat.)@xmath260 ( sys . ) @xcite and @xmath261 ( stat.)@xmath262 ( sys.)@xmath263 ( extrap . )",

    "for @xmath273 in the region of @xmath278 the cloud contributions are comparable in magnitude with the ` bare ' contributions .    the close agreement between our calculations and the agreement implies that any twist three portion of @xmath1 is rather small .",

    "we have used the meson cloud model to calculate the spin dependent structure functions @xmath0 and @xmath1 of the proton and neutron .",
    "an important part of this calculation is the use of ` bare ' structure functions of the hadrons in the model calculated in the mit bag model , with the addition of an extra polarized gluon term , which gives good agreement with the observed value of the lowest moment of @xmath7 ( ellis - jaffe sum rule ) .",
    "we included in our calculations the full effects of kinematic terms that arise at finite @xmath25 because the spin vector of the struck hadron is not parallel with the spin vector of the initial nucleon .",
    "this leads to three or more additional contributions to each spin dependent structure function for each hadron species included in the model nucleon wavefunction .",

    "as the quality of data on neutron structure functions improves , it will be interesting to compare the behaviour of the structure functions as a function of @xmath25 with that predicted by the mcm .",
    "we have not done this here , as most of the data is at fairly low @xmath60 , and the @xmath25 variation in this kinematic region is quite small .",
    "we have considered the effects of possible interference between intermediate states containing different hadrons , which can contribute to the spin dependent parts of the dis cross section .",

    "e.g. _ @xmath281 can give interference contributions .",
    "the difficulties in calculating the dynamics of the relevant vertices are formidable , however these terms are suppressed in the mcm owing to their high mass , so we have ignored these contributions in this work .    our calculations of the spin dependent structure functions show good agreement with the experimental data .",
