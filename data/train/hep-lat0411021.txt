    "twisted mass lattice qcd ( tmlqcd )  @xcite is an alternative regularization for lattice qcd that has recently received considerable attention .",
    "it has the potential to match the attractive features of improved staggered fermions ( efficient simulations  @xcite , absence of `` exceptional configurations ''  @xcite , @xmath4 improvement at maximal twist  @xcite , operator mixing as in the continuum  @xcite ) while not sharing the disadvantage of needing to take roots of the determinant to remove unwanted degrees of freedom .",
    "initial numerical investigations of the unquenched theory  @xcite have , however , found surprisingly large discretization errors , which manifest themselves as a non - trivial phase structure .",
    "while these errors do not pose a fundamental problem , and , indeed , appear to conform to the expectations of chiral perturbation theory applied to the lattice theory  @xcite , they do suggest that a thorough investigation of the impact of discretization errors on the theory is called for .",
    "such an investigation is possible by applying the methods of chiral perturbation theory to tmlqcd at non - zero lattice spacing .",
    "the discretization errors are included systematically in a joint expansion in the lattice spacing , @xmath3 , and the quark mass , @xmath2 .",
    "the resulting `` twisted mass chiral perturbation theory '' ( tm@xmath0pt ) has been formulated previously  @xcite , building on earlier work for the untwisted wilson theory  @xcite .",
    "it has been used to study pion masses and decay constants in the regime where @xmath7  @xcite , and to study the phase structure of tmlqcd when @xmath8  @xcite . here",
    "we build upon our previous work  @xcite , in which we determined the chiral lagrangian at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in a power counting scheme in which we treat @xmath9 .",
    "we use this to study all the quantities involving pions that do not involve final state interactions and are thus straightforward to calculable in simulations : masses ( previously calculated in this regime in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , condensates , vacuum to pion matrix elements , and matrix elements between single pion states ( i.e. form factors ) .",
    "the operators we use are the vector and axial currents and the scalar and pseudoscalar densities .",
    "calculating these quantities allows us to address some of the issues that are of concern when using tmlqcd .",
    "in particular , what is the impact of the breaking of flavor and parity symmetries at non - zero lattice spacing ?",
    "what are good quantities to use to determine the typical size of discretization errors ?",
    "how does the automatic @xmath4 improvement at maximal twist manifest itself in tm@xmath0pt ? how do different definitions of the twist angle , all of which are equivalent in the continuum limit , differ at non - zero lattice spacing ?",
    "how can we test the reliability of tm@xmath0pt applied at a given order ?",
    "we return to these questions in the concluding section .",
    "another issue , which is of particular importance for practical simulations , is the condition on the quark mass that must be enforced in order that physical quantities are automatically @xmath4 improved at maximal twist .",
    "does one need to enforce ( a ) @xmath5 , ( b ) @xmath10 , or ( c ) @xmath11 , with @xmath12 a determinable constant of @xmath13 ?",
    "if one takes @xmath14gev and @xmath15gev , these conditions become ( a ) @xmath16mev , ( b ) @xmath17mev , and ( c ) @xmath18mev , respectively . since the average light quark mass is @xmath19 mev ( at a renormalization scale of @xmath20gev  for a recent review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we need to be able to use condition ( b ) if lattice masses are to allow extrapolation to physical values , or condition ( c ) if they are to approach them .",
    "condition ( a ) is very restrictive .    on the theoretical side , refs .",
    "@xcite argue that , in general , one must use the strongest condition , ( a ) , although it is possible that the intermediate condition , ( b ) , can be used if one is dealing with @xmath4 improved quantities , e.g. if using an @xmath4 improved quark action .",
    "by contrast , it has been recently proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite that there is no lower limit on @xmath2 in order for automatic @xmath4 improvement to apply , as long as one uses an appropriate definition of twist angle .",
    "we will argue here in favor of the weakest condition , ( c ) , with the constant @xmath12 either of @xmath13 , or vanishing , depending on the sign of an unknown constant in the chiral lagrangian .",
    "our arguments are based on tm@xmath0pt applied in the regimes where conditions ( b ) and ( c ) hold .",
    "the former we call the `` generic small mass '' ( gsm ) regime , the latter the `` aoki '' regime ( since it is in this region that non - trivial phase structure due to discretization effects appears  @xcite ) . for most of the paper",
    "we consider the gsm regime , in which we expect the bulk of future simulations to be done .",
    "we give a general argument for automatic @xmath4 improvement in this regime ( which requires the use of an appropriate non - perturbative definition of twist angle ) , and support it with results for the physical quantities listed above .",
    "we then extend the results to the aoki regime , where , working to leading order ( lo ) in an expansion in which @xmath6 , we argue that condition ( b ) can be relaxed to ( c ) .",
    "we stress that our discussion of @xmath4 improvement is within the context of chiral perturbation theory up to a given order ( nlo in the gsm regime , lo in the aoki regime ) .",
    "this means that we only control those @xmath4 corrections that are expected to be dominant in the regimes under study .",
    "for example , in both regimes we control corrections to the pion decay constant , @xmath21 , which are of relative size @xmath22 , but do not control those of relative size @xmath23 .",
    "the latter corrections arise from terms in the chiral lagrangian of @xmath24 and @xmath25 in the gsm and aoki regimes , respectively , which are , in both cases , of higher order than we work .",
    "the remainder of this article is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we recall the definition of tmlqcd and the construction of the corresponding nlo chiral lagrangian , and use this to discuss the condition on the quark mass needed to obtain automatic @xmath4 improvement at maximal twist . in sec .",
    "[ sec : gsm ] we use the lagrangian , including sources for currents and densities , to determine the twist angle non - perturbatively , and to calculate the physical quantities listed above . in the final subsection , we give a summary of our results and a suggestion for how to use them in practice . in sec .",
    "[ sec : aoki ] we show how our results extend into the aoki regime , and comment on the considerations of ref .  @xcite .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] , and suggest various avenues for future work .",
    "some preliminary results from this paper have been presented in ref .",
    "the theory we consider is tmlqcd with a degenerate doublet of quarks .",
    "the fermionic part of the euclidean lattice action of the theory in the so - called `` twisted basis '' is  @xcite : @xmath26 \\psi_l(x),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the dimensionless bare lattice fields ( with  @xmath29 \" standing for lattice and not indicating left - handed ) , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the usual covariant forward and backward dimensionless lattice derivatives , respectively .",
    "the field @xmath27 is a flavor doublet , and @xmath32 acts in flavor space and is normalized so that @xmath33 . the bare normal mass , @xmath34 , and the bare twisted mass , @xmath35 , both of which are dimensionless , are taken to be proportional to the identity matrix in flavor space .    the effective continuum chiral theory is derived using the two - step procedure of ref .  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have carried this procedure out to nlo in an expansion in which we treat quark masses and the leading discretization errors as symmetry breaking parameters of the same size . here",
    "we recall only the essential details .",
    "following the program of symanzik  @xcite , we first write down an effective continuum lagrangian at the quark level which describes the long distance physics of the underlying lattice theory .",
    "its form is constrained by the symmetries of the lattice theory to be @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the continuum gluon lagrangian , @xmath38 is the physical quark mass , defined in the usual way by @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the physical twisted mass @xmath41 with @xmath42 the matching factor for the pseudoscalar density .",
    "the quantity @xmath43 is the critical mass , aside from an @xmath4 shift .",
    "this shift , and methods for determining the critical mass after its inclusion , are discussed below .",
    "note that the lattice symmetries forbid additive renormalization of @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "although the @xmath44 terms in eq .",
    "( [ e : cleff ] ) are of an appropriate size to be included at nlo , they do not break the continuum symmetries any further than the terms explicitly shown , and thus do not lead to any additional operators in the effective chiral theory  @xcite .",
    "thus we do not need their explicit form .",
    "we reiterate here that we have dropped from @xmath45 terms proportional to @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "these terms are allowed by the lattice symmetries  @xcite , and do lead to corrections linear in @xmath3 , but are of next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) in our power counting . in the continuum limit [ where the @xmath49 and higher order terms in ( [ e : cleff ] ) vanish ] the apparent flavor - parity breaking due to",
    "@xmath40 is misleading , since it can be rotated away by a non - anomalous axial rotation .",
    "thus tmlqcd is , in this limit , equivalent to qcd with two degenerate quarks of mass @xmath50 .",
    "this has been established in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we work away from the continuum limit , taking @xmath51 .",
    "thus the symmetry breaking induced by the @xmath49 term will play a crucial role .",

    "in fact , in ref .",
    "@xcite they are denoted `` high - energy constants '' .",

    "the @xmath82 are the extra such terms introduced by discretization errors ( which we did not include explicitly in ref .",
    "@xcite but will need here ) .",
    "it is useful to understand the relation of our result for @xmath83 to that in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that work ,",
    "the authors used a different power - counting , namely @xmath84 .",
    "they worked to linear order in @xmath3 , and without sources .",
    "our results agree with theirs to the order they worked .",
    "they also changed variables using an axial rotation so that @xmath0 was diagonal .",
    "this has the advantage of moving the twist entirely into the term caused by discretization errors , @xmath85 .",
    "it was then straightforward to see that discretization errors in @xmath86 and @xmath21 are proportional to @xmath87 and thus vanish under mass averaging ( @xmath88 ) and at maximal twist ( @xmath89 ) .    in our power",
    "counting , where discretization errors are superficially as large as quark mass effects , we must follow a different strategy to see automatic @xmath4 improvement .",
    "the key point , first noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , is that the leading discretization effect [ the third term in @xmath83 in ( [ e : chijleff ] ) ] has the same form as the leading mass term [ the second term in @xmath83 ] .",
    "this follows directly from the fact that the @xmath49 term in the quark - level effective lagrangian ( [ e : cleff ] ) has the same chiral transformation properties as the quark mass term .",
    "thus the lo chiral lagrangian is unchanged from its continuum form if one uses the shifted spurion @xmath91 this corresponds at the quark level to a redefinition of the untwisted component of the quark mass from @xmath38 to @xmath92 this shift corresponds to an @xmath4 correction to the critical mass , so that it becomes @xmath93 in practice one automatically determines @xmath94 ( and thus automatically uses @xmath95 rather than @xmath38 ) if one uses an appropriate non - perturbative definition of twist angle .",
    "this is discussed in detail in the following section and summarized in the last subsection of sec .",
    "[ sec : gsm ] .",
    "since the lo lagrangian takes the continuum form , the vacuum expectation value of @xmath54 at this order is that which cancels out the twist in the shifted mass matrix : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the lo result for the pion mass - squared .",
    "if we define the physical quark mass by @xmath98 then it follows from ( [ e : vaclo ] ) that @xmath99 equation ( [ e : vaclo ] ) is one of the definitions of twist angle that we will use , although it is not the most simple to determine through simulations .",
    "it is important to realize that it differs by @xmath13 from the naive definition @xmath100 when @xmath101 .",
    "when working in this mass regime , it is thus crucial to use the shifted mass @xmath95 , or , equivalently at nlo , one of the definitions of twist angle discussed below .",
    "this point has also been emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we can now present our argument for why automatic @xmath4 improvement holds even when @xmath102 .",
    "this will be borne out later by our detailed results .",
    "we begin by expressing the chiral lagrangian in terms of @xmath103 instead of @xmath0 : @xmath104 ^ 2 \\notag \\\\ & \\quad + l_5 \\left\\ { \\mathrm{tr}\\left[(d_\\mu \\sigma^\\dagger d_\\mu \\sigma )        ( \\chi'^{\\dagger } \\sigma +   \\sigma^\\dagger\\chi')\\right ] -\\mathrm{tr}(d_\\mu \\sigma^\\dagger d_\\mu \\sigma )        \\mathrm{tr}(\\chi'^{\\dagger } \\sigma +   \\sigma^\\dagger\\chi')/2 \\right\\ } \\notag \\\\ & \\quad - l_7 \\big[\\mathrm{tr}(\\chi'^{\\dagger } \\sigma - \\sigma^\\dagger\\chi')\\big]^2 - l_8 \\left\\ { \\mathrm{tr}\\big[(\\chi'^{\\dagger } \\sigma\\ ! + \\",

    "we have also introduced the useful combinations @xmath108 this lagrangian has the same form as the nlo continuum chiral lagrangian aside from the `` @xmath109 '' and @xmath110 terms .",
    "we are interested in the terms which are linear in @xmath3 . setting aside the @xmath110 term ,",
    "since it contributes only to condensates , this leaves the terms multiplied by @xmath111 , @xmath109 and @xmath112 .",
    "the latter is in fact redundant , as we discuss below , so can be ignored .",
    "the key point is then that , in both the @xmath111 and @xmath109 terms , the lattice spacing appears in the combination @xmath113 if we now expand @xmath54 about @xmath114 in the following way , @xmath115 then the quantity ( [ e : aterm ] ) , with @xmath57 set to its final value @xmath63 , is invariant under the spurionic symmetry",
    "@xmath116 it follows that terms even ( odd ) in pion fields must be even ( odd ) in @xmath117 . since the only functions of @xmath117 which can appear are @xmath118 and @xmath119 , the former must be multiplied by an even function of pion fields , the latter by an odd .",
    "thus at maximal twist ( @xmath120 ) the quantity ( [ e : aterm ] ) produces only odd powers of pion fields , and , in particular , has no vacuum expectation value .",
    "we also need to consider the combinations @xmath121 which appear in the @xmath122 and @xmath109 terms .",
    "these are also invariant under the spurionic symmetry , but are independent of @xmath117 , and thus must be even in pion fields . now , when determining the consequences of the nlo terms , it is sufficient to expand about the lo vacuum , as we have done in ( [ e : loexpand ] ) .",
    "it then follows that the @xmath111 and @xmath109 terms only give rise , at maximal twist , to vertices involving odd numbers of pions .",
    "the physical vertices , which involve even numbers of pions , do not receive any corrections proportional to @xmath3 and are thus automatically improved .",
    "of course , the contribution linear in the pion field coming from the @xmath109 term leads to an @xmath4 tadpole , which can convert lo into nlo vertices with one less pion .",
    "however , since the lo vertices only have even numbers of pions , the resulting vertices with @xmath4 corrections all contain an odd number of pions .",
    "again , the physical vertices are not corrected until @xmath44 .",
    "these arguments can also be extended to external sources , with the conclusion that physical matrix elements are automatically improved .",
    "conversely , parity violating matrix elements are maximal at maximal twist .",
    "according to the general considerations of ref .",
    "@xcite , these results are expected for @xmath123 .",
    "our argument here shows that they hold also in the gsm regime in which @xmath124 .",
    "this does not require the use of an improved quark action , but it is essential to use a definition of maximal twist that sets @xmath95 , rather than @xmath38 , to zero .",
    "a possible concern is how these considerations generalize to extensions of the chiral lagrangian incorporating other particles , e.g. baryons and heavy - light mesons .",
    "the point is that , although the pauli and mass terms in the effective continuum lagrangian ( [ e : cleff ] ) have the same chiral transformation properties , they are not proportional as operators . thus , although they will always enter any extension of the chiral lagrangian with the same form , their relative strength ( @xmath125 in the pionic sector discussed above ) will depend on the quantity being considered .",
    "for example , the coefficient of a baryon mass term of the form @xmath126 and that of the corresponding term caused by discretization errors , @xmath127 , will not be in the ratio @xmath125 . thus using the shifted mass @xmath95 will not , in general ,",
    "remove the @xmath57 term .",
    "it seems , then , that we should be concerned , when @xmath101 , that the mass and discretization contributions are of the same size in general .",
    "the resolution of this concern is simply that the term linear in @xmath3 is removed by working at maximal twist .",
    "in fact , we can see this in our calculations , because quantities such as @xmath21 , which do not vanish in the chiral limit , have a similar status in the chiral expansion as does the nucleon mass ( although the details of the expansion differ ) .",
    "we conclude this section by addressing a few technical points .",
    "first , we discuss the @xmath112 term . as noted above",
    ", this term is redundant : it can be transformed into a combination of the @xmath109 , @xmath128 and @xmath110 terms by the change of variables @xmath129 the shifted coefficients of the remaining three terms are @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "all physical quantities must depend on these combinations and not on @xmath112 , @xmath109 , @xmath128 and @xmath110 separately .",
    "for this reason , we refer to them as `` physical combinations '' of lecs , despite the fact that they are introduced by discretization errors .",
    "although we could remove @xmath112 by this change of variables , we have kept it , both because we have found it to provide a useful diagnostic in the computations of matrix elements , and because it helps in understanding the impact of improving the underlying lattice theory , as we now discuss .",
    "we next consider how the effective lagrangian changes if the underlying wilson action , currents and densities are @xmath4 improved , as this illuminates the nature of the lecs introduced by discretization errors .",
    "the required improvement coefficients have been presented in ref .",
    "as already noted , mass dependent @xmath4 corrections are of higher order than we consider here .",
    "thus the only improvement coefficients that are needed are @xmath133 , i.e. the coefficient of the lattice pauli term in the quark action , and the standard improvement terms for the vector and axial currents proportional to @xmath134 and @xmath135 , respectively .",
    "we refer to refs .",
    "@xcite for details of these terms and discussion of how they can be determined non - perturbatively . if @xmath133 is set to its non - perturbative value , then the coefficient @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ e : cleff ] ) vanishes , so that corrections to the quark effective action are of @xmath44 .",
    "it follows that @xmath136 , and the @xmath4 shift in @xmath137 is absent , so that @xmath138 .",
    "the chiral effective lagrangian then takes the same form as in eq .",
    "( [ e : chijleffpr ] ) , except that the factor of @xmath60 in @xmath57 should be dropped ( with concomitant changes in the dimensions of various lecs ) , and , most importantly , @xmath139 . these latter two terms , which are proportional to @xmath140 and @xmath141 respectively , are absent because there is no term linear in @xmath3 in the underlying quark lagrangian .",
    "the coefficient @xmath112 does not , however , vanish since it corresponds to @xmath4 corrections to currents , and these have not yet been improved .",
    "similarly , @xmath110 is non - zero .",
    "finally , @xmath142 is non vanishing since it is proportional to @xmath143",
    ". if the axial current is also non - perturbatively improved , then one has in addition that @xmath144 ( as can be seen from the result below for @xmath145 ) .",

    "in practice , when using tmlqcd , one should clearly work at maximal twist and avoid the need for such corrections",
    ". nevertheless , it might be worthwhile using tmlqcd to determine the lecs ( which , for small enough quark masses , are mass independent , though they do depend on the lattice spacing and gauge action ) and then try to correct results previously obtained with unimproved untwisted wilson fermions .",
    "as noted in the introduction , it is of practical interest to study how the results obtained in the gsm regime change when one enters the aoki regime .",
    "we recall that the latter is defined at the quark level as the region where @xmath332 , or in tm@xmath0pt by @xmath333 .",
    "in the aoki regime , competition between terms of size @xmath158 and @xmath161 leads to a non - trivial phase structure , with first order transition lines ending at second - order endpoints .",

    "@xcite and we do not recapitulate the analysis here .",
    "we will present results which hold throughout the aoki regime except on the phase transition lines themselves .    before presenting results we would like to make a general comment on the concept of @xmath4 improvement in the aoki regime .",
    "the improvement program is predicated on the assumption of small discretization errors .",
    "in particular the discretization effects are assumed not to cause large changes in the vacuum .",
    "this assumption clearly breaks down in the aoki regime , where , in general , the direction of the quark condensate is determined by a competition between quark masses and discretization errors and the result differs by angles of @xmath13 from the continuum theory . thus in taking the limit @xmath334 , quantities do not change in a manner which is perturbative in @xmath3 , and the language of @xmath4 improvement can not be applied . this point has been emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a possible exception to this discussion has been raised in ref .",
    "they argue that @xmath4 improvement at maximal twist remains valid in the aoki regime , as long as an appropriate choice of twist angle is used .",

    "irrespective of this general question , one can simulate in the aoki regime and it is useful to obtain the predictions of tm@xmath0pt .",
    "we stress that , even though the language of @xmath4 improvement may not apply , one can still use symanzik s continuum effective lagrangian to study the theory in the aoki regime .",
    "now we turn to the results .",

    ", we can drop some of the nlo terms used above .",
    "in particular , to study the vacuum alignment and pion masses we need only keep the @xmath142 term  those proportional to @xmath109 , @xmath111 and the @xmath73 can be dropped .",
    "when we consider the currents and densities , however , a new feature emerges .",

    "as already noted , the fundamental difference between the gsm and aoki regimes is that the condensate is no longer closely aligned with the quark mass . in other words",

    "if we start in the aoki regime at @xmath226 , and remain on the @xmath40 axis as @xmath3 is reduced ( so that we move into the gsm regime and ultimately to the continuum limit ) we expect that physical quantities , at fixed quark masses , will extrapolate smoothly to the continuum with errors quadratic in @xmath3 .",
    "the caveat is that the argument will fail if , as @xmath40 is reduced , one encounters a phase boundary .",
    "this is expected to happen in one of the two possible scenarios for the phase diagram  @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "in which @xmath268 , the end - point of the phase boundary occurs at @xmath355 , where @xmath356 .",
    "values of @xmath62 greater than this are allowed , but for smaller values the condensate changes rapidly ( by an amount of @xmath13 while the quark mass changes by @xmath44 ) , and continuum @xmath0pt expressions fail .",
    "in the other scenario ( @xmath267 ) we see no need to impose a lower limit on @xmath40unless @xmath357 is unnaturally small , yet higher order terms in the chiral potential will not change the phase structure .",
    "it is worth noting the accuracy with which the critical mass must be determined to stay at @xmath226 within an error of @xmath4 .",
    "this is the accuracy that is required to automatically remove the @xmath4 terms . in the gsm regime ,",
    "where @xmath358 , this requires knowing @xmath95 to an absolute accuracy of @xmath44 . in the aoki regime , however , the required absolute accuracy decreases to @xmath24 .",
    "this sounds like a difficult goal , but , in fact , as we discussed in the summary of the previous section , it is attainable even by doing simulations in the gsm regime .",
    "in this paper we have used effective field theory methods to study the discretization errors in tmlqcd .",
    "we have presented results for a number of pionic quantities that can be calculated in lattice simulations , and studied different possible definitions of the twist angle .",
    "perhaps the most interesting quantities to calculate are the difference @xmath359 ( which indicates the size of the @xmath4 uncertainty in the twist angle ) , the splitting @xmath360 ( which indicates the size of @xmath44 flavor breaking , but parity conserving , quantities ) and the axial and pseudoscalar form factors of the pion ( which are the simplest examples of unphysical quantities ) . to our knowledge",
    ", none of these quantities have been calculated to date , and we urge that they be considered in the future .    in the introduction , we raised a number of issues concerning tmlqcd ; now we can comment on what we have learnt about these . concerning the impact of flavor and parity breaking ,",
    "we have seen how this contributes to unphysical quantities at @xmath4 , and in one case , to physical quantities at @xmath44 .",
    "this case is the pion mass splitting , where we confirm the interesting result of ref .",
    "@xcite that knowledge of the sign of the splitting allows one to predict the nature of the phase structure in the aoki region .",
    "nevertheless , at nlo in tm@xmath0pt , the pions in the loops are degenerate , and there is no flavor breaking in decay constants or vector and scalar form factors . for staggered fermions , where the `` taste '' breaking between pions is also of @xmath44 , it has been found essential to include this breaking in loop contributions in order to make good fits to the chiral behavior  @xcite .",
    "if this turns out to be true also for tmlqcd ( which depends on the size of the as yet unmeasured flavor breaking ) , then the @xmath0pt calculations will need to be extended beyond nlo .",
    "one possibility which we are investigating is to use a power counting like that in ref .",
    "@xcite , so that a full nnlo calculation is not needed .",
    "we also asked which quantities are good indicators of the size of discretization errors .",
    "one answer is that it may be easier to use the flavor - parity violating quantities ( i.e. the difference between different definitions of twist angle , and the axial and pseudoscalar form factors ) , since these are of @xmath4 ( even at maximal twist ) and thus easier to calculate . in more general terms , studying these quantities in simulations would allow a more thorough test of our understanding of tmlqcd .",
    "another interesting question is how we can test the reliability of tm@xmath0pt at the order we are working .",
    "our results , in fact , contain a number of predictions that are valid at nlo but not at higher order .",
    "in particular , as we have outlined in the summary subsection of sec .",
    "[ sec : gsm ] , most of the flavor - parity violating form factors can be predicted once the other quantities that we have discussed have been calculated .",
    "such tests are important for establishing the credibility of the chiral and continuum extrapolations that must ultimately be done .",
    "we have discussed extensively the issue of the smallest quark mass that can be used without invalidating automatic @xmath4 improvement at maximal twist . we have argued that one can certainly work in the gsm regime ( @xmath124 ) and also at least part - way into the aoki regime ( @xmath361 ) .",
    "this is only true , however , if one uses the appropriate definition of twist angle .",
    "allowable choices are that determined from the vanishing of the coupling of the bare axial current in the twisted basis to the charged pion , or from the vanishing of the coupling of the pseudoscalar density to the neutral pion .",
    "alternatively one could fix the twisted mass @xmath40 and vary the untwisted mass until the pion masses ( either charged or neutral ) reach their minimum values  @xcite .",
    "what is potentially problematic is to determine the critical quark mass by extrapolating the squared pion mass to zero along the untwisted wilson axis using only moderately small quark masses . in the gsm regime",
    "this may not , in practice , give the critical mass with the accuracy needed ( errors of absolute size @xmath44 ) to ensure @xmath4 improvement at maximal twist . in ref .",
    "such bending is expected in most quantities if one approaches the untwisted wilson axis along a line parallel to the twisted mass axis .",
    "it would be interesting to fit the results from this work under this hypothesis , using the formulae we have provided .",
    "] furthermore , this method does not apply in the aoki regime , where it gives a determination of the critical mass with an absolute error of @xmath44 , whereas the required accuracy is @xmath24 .",
    "one spin - off from our calculation is a method for determining the new lecs that enter when one incorporates discretization errors .",
    "this both allows a direct measure of their size , and can be used _ a posteriori _ to correct results obtained with untwisted wilson fermions .",
    "furthermore , our calculations extend the results that are available from @xmath0pt applied to untwisted wilson quarks  @xcite to several new quantities",
    ".    many of the quantities we have considered will be difficult to calculate in lattice simulations because they involve quark - disconnected contractions .",
    "an important practical question to consider is whether , by using partially quenched tmlqcd and its corresponding @xmath0pt  @xcite , one can make predictions for the quark - connected and disconnected contributions separately .",
    "it will also be interesting to extend the calculations to the case of a non - degenerate doublet of quarks  @xcite .",
