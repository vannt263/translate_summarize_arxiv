    "in view of recent success in the theoretical description and experimental observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) a detailed analysis of all the processes occurring in cosmological recombination era is required . for a precise description of cmb in astrophysical investigations the different photon - emission and absorption , photon - electron scattering and etc .",
    "processes should be included .",
    "the spectral characteristics of the emitted radiation due to different phenomena , the polarization state and the cross - section are particularly relevant from the astrophysical point of view . in standard calculations for such kind of tasks the quantum mechanical approach for the isolated atom is applied .",
    "however , the consideration of the `` atom - fields '' interaction becomes important in case of astrophysical experiments with accuracy of about @xmath0 @xcite , @xcite and with the expectation of even increasing the accuracy up to the level of @xmath9 .",
    "atom s interaction with an external fields can lead to effects like population inversion , steady - state solution , line strengths , cross sections , susceptibility and polarization and etc @xcite-@xcite .",
    "apart from other powerful methods ( green function approach , for example ) the statistical operator theory can be applied for the study of the `` atom - field '' systems .",
    "application of the density matrix formalism in three - level approximation seems to be more simple and appropriate in this case . the clear description of the density matrix theory and its applications , such as spontaneous emission , line broadening ( power broadening and saturation , collision line broadening , doppler broadening and voigt profile ) , can be found , for example , in @xcite .",
    "the radiation transfer theory that is usually applied in the research of cosmic microwave background was suggested in @xcite , @xcite . in particular , it was established that the @xmath10 transition is able to substantially control the dynamics of cosmological hydrogen recombination .",
    "moreover , distortions of the order @xmath11 were predicted @xcite .",
    "recently , the radiation transfer theory for the recombination era of early universe was intensively re - examined due to precise observations of the cmb @xcite , @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "@xcite corrections to the ionization history were found that exceed the percent - level . in order to achieve this accuracy the multi - photon decays in atoms involving set of states",
    "should be included in evaluation of cmb formation @xcite-@xcite . as a rule",
    "the two - photon decays of the excited states are considered for the evaluation of cmb .",
    "two - photon emission processes were evaluated accurately in @xcite-@xcite . in our recent works @xcite ,",
    "@xcite three- and four - photon transitions with separation out of the two - photon links were considered from astrophysical point of view . in @xcite , @xcite we considered one- and two - photon transitions in external electric fields .",
    "such modifications should have a strong impact to the determination of the key cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "generally , the absorption coefficient calculated per atom is used for the study of the radiative transfer in spectral lines .",
    "the influence of powerful high - frequency electromagnetic radiation on the absorption coefficient in the low - frequency line in a three - level @xmath12 atom was considered in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider the other kind of multi - photon process , namely , the electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) phenomena .",
    "the nature of eit phenomena can be examined by evaluation of the response of the multilevel system to the presence of an external radiation field .",

    "a complete and detailed treatment of a three - level ladder atom , absorption and emission spectra , as the transient and steady - state response of the @xmath13-atom are given in @xcite .",
    "we study the response of the three - level ladder system on the external fields originating from photons emitted during the recombination and evaluate the absorption coefficient , which we apply to radiation transfer theory .",
    "the physics of an atom interacting with photon fields can be understood on the basis of the `` interfering - pathways '' description , which corresponds to multi - photon process defined in term of a power series expansion over fields amplitudes ( see e.g. refs .",

    "our paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we shall briefly review essentials of the density - matrix approach when deriving the density matrices element @xmath14 and presenting its series expansion . in section 3",
    "we shall define the absorption coefficient and illustrate its application to astrophysics on the basis of the @xcite .",
    "in the subsequent sections we shall provide numerical calculations together with a discussion of the results .",
    "we conclude the paper with a summary .",
    "in this section we employ the three - level ladder scheme for the description of the hydrogen atom .",
    "we assume that the hydrogen atoms formed during the recombination epoch in earlier universe reach their ground states via emission of photons of all the spectral lines corresponding to atomic continuum - bound and bound - bound transitions .",
    "all the emitted photons generate the ( coherent ) external field environment , which feats back onto the hydrogen atom .",
    "investigation of this self - consistent scenario under the conditions of cosmic expansion is the aim of the present paper .",
    "we confine our consideration to the spontaneous emission rates .",
    "collisional excitation and ionization can be omitted because at the relevant temperatures and densities they are negligible for a three - level hydrogen atom @xcite .    to identify the possible effect we discuss atoms subjected to an external field which mainly consists of two adjacent spectral lines , namely the @xmath15 and @xmath16 lines , with the initial condition corresponding to full population of the atomic ground state .",

    "after recombination photons were able to travel through universe and formed the cmb .",

    "thus , we are confronted with the consideration of the phenomena of electromagnetically induced transparancy .",
    "we employed the quantum optical evaluation of the integrated line absorption coefficient that assumes application of photon beams ( laser ) . in astrophysics the photon beam diffusion is accounted for via the sobolev optical depth .",
    "usually , the standard line profile is employed for the solution of the recombination problem and description of the cmb formation processes and the integrated line absorption coefficient is defined via einstein coefficients in frames of the sobolev approximation .",

    "we expect that the modifications of this magnitude should definitely be relevant in determinations of the key cosmological parameters .",
    "the problem of dephasing appears when defining the magnitude of the field .",
    "the effect of dephasing leads to the spectral line broadening . to prevent dephasing phenomena we confined the definition of the field by a narrow strip . in this case",
    "the width of the corresponding line appears as a natural parameter . in our calculations we used the following relation @xmath107 .",
