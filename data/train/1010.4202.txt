    "the recovery of objects , for example , densities and functionals thereof , based on noisy indirect observations , otherwise known as statistical inverse problems ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , is scientifically of intense interest .",
    "the literature is vast and we mention only a few selected papers . most of the work is concerned with deconvolution on euclidean spaces .",
    "prominent approaches are based on wavelet and wavelet - vagulette expansions ( see @xcite and @xcite ) or , on singular value decompositions ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , where for the latter block thresholding techniques lead to adaptive estimators ( see @xcite ) .",
    "minimax rates in deconvolution have been investigated by fan @xcite , and many others .",
    "recently , oracle inequalities have been proved in @xcite .",
    "the specific problem of boxcar deconvolution and its link to diophantine approximation have been investigated in @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "other methods include the linear functional strategy ( see @xcite and variants thereof ) . very popular",
    "are fourier series estimators which have been known for a long time , and often they become particularly simple because on euclidean spaces they can be treated with kernel methods ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we note that even though our approach also utilizes fourier methods on groups , due to the hyperbolic geometry , the resulting estimator can not be treated by kernel methods thus complicating our endeavor considerably .",
    "in this paper we provide a novel methodology for statistical object recovery on the poincar upper half plane which we call the problem of mbius deconvolution . here the group of mbius transformations is given by all fractions of the form @xmath1 for a complex number @xmath2 and a @xmath3 matrix with real entries @xmath4 of determinant 1 .",
    "the metric which is invariant under these transformations is the hyperbolic metric ( to be specified in the next section ) which will replace the euclidean metric in a natural way .",
    "in fact , a key observation is that this problem can be tackled by generalized fourier methods similar in spirit to the euclidean case .",
    "the development of the theory builds on the foundations laid out in @xcite , chapter 3 .",
    "however , extending euclidean arguments to this manifold is challenging since the hyperbolic space is noncompact , the ( hyperbolic ) geometry is non - euclidean and the group of mbius transformations is noncommutative .",
    "a  fundamental technical difficulty comes from a lack of a dilation property that does not extend over from the euclidean case . despite these difficulties ,",
    "a generic element is the riemannian structure on a manifold , on which a laplacian can then be defined .",
    "this together with the generic euclidean approach as outlined in @xcite will be the foundation to what will be presented below .",
    "in addition to the theoretical interest of this novel scenario of m \" obius deconvolution , there are important practical applications as well .",
    "one particular situation occurs in alternating current circuit analysis and design whenever signals travel through circuit elements as well as whenever geometries of waveguides change .",
    "a simple example of the latter is a connector to a coaxial cable , say . here , the so - called `` reflections '' are modeled on the complex unit disk and the corresponding `` impedances '' occur in a complex half plane .",
    "usually , these reflections or impedances are not directly visible but observed through other electrical devices , such as a `` two - port '' which in turn is modeled by mbius transformations . in particular , a class of so - called `` lossless '' two - ports can be identified with @xmath3 matrices of determinant 1 .",
    "one particular aspect of mbius deconvolution is related to the temporal decay of impedances of capacitors whereby the above scenario on the poincar plane exactly describes the physical system that is of statistical interest .",
    "other applications include the field of electrical impedance spectroscopy , as well as electrical impedance tomography . in the former ,",
    "measuring varying impedances due to variable ion transport through biological membranes is currently of high interest in view of pharmaceutical drug design ( see @xcite as well as @xcite ) . in the latter , in a noninvasive and radiation - free way",
    ", medical imaging can be cost effectively accomplished by measuring skin - impedances ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . indeed , for successful reconstruction , control of various errors is of paramount importance ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there is also work in higher - dimensional hyperbolic spaces with respect to medical imaging ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in statistics",
    "there is also some recognition of the poincar plane and its hyperbolic geometry particularly so because the parameter space of the gaussian distribution ( with unknown mean and standard deviation ) is this space .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown by several authors that the riemannian metric derived from the fisher information is exactly hyperbolic ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "obviously , location and dispersion parameters of arbitrary distributions and random estimators thereof can be viewed within the poincar plane .",
    "curiously here , the family of cauchy distributions play a specific role as being equivariant under mbius transformations ( see @xcite for this and its consequences for parameter estimation ) . based on the above",
    ", techniques from the hyperbolic geometry of the poincar plane are developed exclusively from a parametric point of view ( cf .",
    "as far as the authors are aware , our contribution is the first attempt at nonparametric developments .",
    "we now summarize the paper .",

    "fourier analysis needed for this paper . following this ,",
    "section [ sec : main ] presents the main results . in section [ simulation - scn ]",
    "we focus on computational aspects of mbius deconvolution illustrating the ideas through simulations . to this end",
    "we introduce in addition to the hyperbolic gauss the hyperbolic laplace distribution . in section [ engineering - scn ]",
    "we go into explicit detail with respect to the mbius deconvolution problem for statistically recovering the temporal decay of impedances of capacitors as outlined two paragraphs above .",
    "we will briefly sketch the background ; however , if the reader is well versed in this field , then one can start from section [ example - scn ] where we examine a data set that was acquired through collaboration with the university of applied sciences ( fulda , germany ) that depicts the physical system of this paper .",
    "in particular , we are able to identify random impedances when only their impedances viewed through random capacitive two - ports are given .",

    "for example , @xmath265 ) . in most applications it turns out that @xmath263 is symmetric ; the corresponding two - port is then called _ reciprocal_.    one easily verifies that the _ chain matrix _ which is usually denoted by  ( the russian letter `` cha '' ) relating @xmath266 with @xmath267 is given by @xmath268 [ in contrast to the mathematical literature , the engineering literature tends to use a _ transmission matrix _ relating @xmath269 with @xmath267 instead , with reversed @xmath270 in figure [ ports - fig](b ) ] .",
    "an advantage of the chain matrix over the impedance matrix is that the former is well defined for the limit @xmath271 , for example , for an ideal coil in series with the load .",
    "again , only using lossless ( i.e. , purely imaginary ) impedances ( such as ideal inductances , transformers and capacitors ) guarantees that the corresponding chain matrix has real diagonal coefficients and imaginary coefficients elsewhere .",
    "moreover , for cascaded two - ports ( i.e. , several two - ports in serial connection ) , the resulting chain matrix is just the product of the individual chain matrices . by linear algebraic decomposition of @xmath29",
    "it can be shown that every lossless two - port of lumped elements can be modeled by cascading combinations of two - ports involving only inductances , transformers and capacitors ( see @xcite , page 18 ) .",
    "note that @xmath272 in figure [ ports - fig](b ) . hence  defines a mbius transformation relating load impedance with the input impedance of the two - port @xmath273 here",
    ", @xmath274 is the impedance of the load @xmath275 as viewed through the two - port . as a consequence",
    "we make the following remark .",
    "serial cascading of lossless two - ports is equivalent to the action of the mbius group @xmath29 on the @xmath276-fold @xmath277 of load impedances @xmath248 .",
    "we are thus led to the statistical inverse problem ( cf .",

    "in conclusion we note that one may as well consider normalized impedances @xmath281 or equivalently reflection coefficients , ( [ load - refl ] ) .",
    "then the mapping for the normalized impedances goes as follows : @xmath282      it is well known that over the duration of years properties of electronic equipment change due to wear - out effects of various elements . in particular , electrolyte capacitors have a tendency to loose capacitance . in effect",
    ", older electronic devices deviate from original calibration and may feature nondesired side - effects ; for example , field strengths of transmitters may grow stronger than tolerated .        in an application of our method we consider a series of @xmath283 measurements of random resistors of @xmath284 @xmath285 provided with an accuracy of 10 percent by the manufacturer ( they range from @xmath286 @xmath285 to @xmath287 @xmath285 ) viewed through 30 random capacitors at 1 khz taken at the department of electrical engineering , university of applied sciences , fulda , germany .",

    "measurement of the capacitors gives @xmath294 corresponding to a spread of roughly @xmath295 .",
