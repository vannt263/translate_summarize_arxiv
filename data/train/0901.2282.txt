    "in the present section we consider a system which is coupled to a single heat bath and is mechanically driven out of equilibrium .",
    "mechanical work is done on the system by shearing it in the horizontal direction .",
    "boundary conditions are periodic in the horizontal direction ( parallel to the shear ) and open in the vertical direction . in a shear event ,",
    "the horizontal line with coordinate @xmath190 is moved by @xmath191 lattice steps to the right .",
    "shear events occur at regular intervals of @xmath192 elementary monte carlo moves , with the shear period @xmath192 submultiple of @xmath193 . for each monte carlo sweep ( mcs ) over the lattice there are @xmath194 kawasaki moves and @xmath195 shear events .",
    "this model can be thought of as a discrete version for the kinetic equation of a binary mixture subject to the convective velocity @xmath196 having a shear rate @xmath197 .",
    "the model , with single  spin ",
    "flip dynamics , was used to study domain growth properties of sheared systems in @xcite .    the heat released to the bath during the evolution",
    "will be computed as in eq .",
    "( [ calore ] ) , where the index @xmath198 will be dropped since here the system is exchanging energy with a single reservoir at temperature @xmath13 .",
    "work done on the system is instead defined as the energy variation in shear events .",
    "starting from a random configuration , with shear applied at a constant rate , a steady state is reached .",
    "as before , the pds for heat and work relative to the steady state can be constructed collecting the values integrated over segments of length @xmath0 in a long trajectory .    in the following we report results obtained for a @xmath199 lattice , with @xmath200 , shear step @xmath201 and shear period @xmath202 , which corresponds to a shear rate @xmath203 .",
    "data have been taken mainly with @xmath204 mcs to reach the ness and @xmath205 mcs for the measurements .",
    "a few longer ( @xmath206 mcs ) runs have been made for some data points .    in fig .",
    "[ shear - pds ] we show the work and heat pds . at smaller @xmath0 the heat distributions are more peaked than the work pds while they become more similar when @xmath0 increases . in all cases",
    "the pds are very well fitted by gaussian distributions and the work and heat pds at different @xmath0 collapse on a master curve when rescaled as in fig .",

    "@xmath207 mcs have been discarded in order to reach stationarity and @xmath206 mcs have been used for measurements .",

    "[ pdf_kawas_abovetc ] ( @xmath208 and @xmath209 are the standard deviations of @xmath107 and @xmath210 , respectively , for different @xmath0).,title=\"fig:\",height=245 ] -1.4 cm    as in sect .",
    "2 , also here we define the distance from the expected asymptotic behavior @xmath211 where , analogously to eq .",
    "( [ slope ] ) , the slope @xmath212 is defined as @xmath213 where the signs @xmath214 are for @xmath215 , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ shear - slopes ] we report the behavior of @xmath216 as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath216 tend to zero , but differently than in the case of thermodynamic driving , the approach to the expected asymptotic result is slower , especially for the heat .",
    "analogously to the case of two thermostats , the ratio of the probability of a trajectory over that of the time - reversed is given by @xmath217 where , for each trajectory , the relation @xmath218 holds .",
    "proceeding as in the case with thermodynamic drive one arrives at an expression similar to eq .",
    "( [ deviazione1 ] ) @xmath219 where the signs @xmath126 are for @xmath220 respectively , and @xmath221 is an unknown quantity that can be used as a fit parameter . in doing that we find a very good agreement between formula ( [ deviazioneshear ] ) and the numerical data for @xmath210 , while the accordance ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ shear - slopes ] ) is very poor for @xmath107 , probably because , as already noticed , this quantity has a slower convergence . the faster convergence of @xmath210 can be possibly ascribed to the fact that , after making the quasi - equilibrium assumption @xmath222 and calculating the averages over trajectories as in sec .",
    "[ finitetau ] , the boundary term proportional to @xmath223 cancels for the work while it remains when one consider the behavior of the heat .",

    "in this article we have considered the issue of the frs in the ising model with nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "we focused on two different ness , induced by a thermodynamic drive provided by two thermostats at different temperatures , or by a mechanical forcing realized by shearing the system .",
    "we find that the fr ( [ fr ] ) is verified in any case when @xmath1 is sufficiently large .",
    "for the case with different thermostats , we have also provided an exacting test of the fr in the far from equilibrium regime where deviations from the linear response theory are observed with the green - kubo relation violated ( above @xmath87 ) , or the pds are not gaussian ( below @xmath87 ) .",
    "furthermore , we have analyzed the effects of finite time by proposing a scaling law which takes into account the geometry of the system and the details of the interaction with the baths and that is well verified numerically . according to this law the leading corrections to the fr ( [ fr ] ) decay as @xmath225 , in agreement with what found in some previous studies @xcite , while the dependence on the system size relies on the details of the coupling to the baths .",
    "the derivation of our scaling law is based on few strong but general hypotheses , which could , in principle , be verified also in different systems . a natural perspective for future work ,",
    "therefore , is the understanding of the possible generality of our results in different contexts .",
    "most of the results of this paper are obtained for systems that are able to equilibrate in the small entropy production limit @xcite .",
    "basically this means that , for this class of systems , the equilibrium state is recovered in a finite time when the drive is switched off . in this case",
    "the fr generally holds , as we have explicitly verified .",
    "the generalization of the fr to systems which do not equilibrate in the small entropy production limit is a very interesting issue .",
    "non - equilibration typically happens when the limit of large @xmath1 is taken after the thermodynamic limit in systems , such as glasses or ferromagnets below the critical temperature , whose equilibration time diverges with the system size .",
    "regarding these non - equilibrating systems , some conjectures have recently appeared in the literature @xcite , inferring that a relation similar to ( [ fr ] ) holds , where , however , the entropy production , instead of being a function of the bath(s ) temperature ( as for instance in eqs.([fr2t],[frw ] ) ) , depends on @xmath226 , namely the effective temperature @xcite which characterizes the dynamics of these systems . for the model considered in this paper one",
    "has @xmath227 @xcite . in this perspective , therefore , it would be very interesting to study the technically demanding case of the ising model with shear for @xmath160 .",
