    "molecules in gases and liquids , or free electrons and holes in crystals , etc . , can be treated as `` small brownian particles '' ( bp ) since their thermal motion undoubtedly is `` not less random '' than motion of the r.browns pollen suspended in water .",
    "therefore , seemingly , the a.einsteins reasonings @xcite can be applied to a small molecular - size bp too , again producing the diffusion equation for probability density of bp s position .",
    "the diffusion equation , in its turn , implies that probability distribution , @xmath0 , of displacement of bp , @xmath1 , during time interval @xmath2 , at long enough @xmath3 tends to the gaussian distribution : @xmath4 formally , einstein in @xcite assumed that @xmath1 consists of many increments which are _ statistically independent _ in the sense of the probability theory .",
    "thus , from statistical point of view , his result is equivalent to the `` _ law of large numbers _ '' discovered by j.bernoulli almost two centuries earlier @xcite .",
    "the idea of _ statistical independency _ , in the form of the `` stosszahlansatz '' , or `` molecular chaos hypothesis '' , was also taken by l.boltzmann as a principle of his molecular - kinetic theory of gases @xcite .",
    "later in @xcite n.bogolyubov imparted it , after non - principal modification , to a theory based on the bogolyubov - born - green - kirkwood - yvon ( bbgky ) hierarchy of equations @xcite .",
    "it was violence against own brainchild , because the bbgky equations are quite all - sufficient ones and do not need in any add - on ( except natural initial conditions , of course ) .",
    "unfortunately , the violence lasts up to now : various ( higher - order , non - local , etc . ) generalizations of the boltzmann kinetic equation to relatively dense gases @xcite all the same rest upon one or another variant of the `` stosszahlansatz '' .",
    "although an attempt to break this tradition was made in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    at same time of the forties , n.krylov in his book",
    "@xcite ( first published in 1950 in russian ) argued that probability - theoretic concepts under use in modern kinetics generally are incompatible with principles of statistical mechanics .",
    "especially he emphasized fallacy of common opinions that `` _ probabilities do exist regardless of a theoretical construct and full - scale experiments _ '' and that `` _ obviously independent phenomena should possess independent probability distributions _ '' ( italics mark brief citations from @xcite ) . according to krylov ,",
    "`` physical independency '' of events in reality does not mean their `` _ statistical independency _ '' in theory .    at present ,",
    "survivability of the prejudices disclosed by krylov is the only excuse of the `` stosszahlansatz '' or similar conjectures .",
    "they gave rise to conviction that in the limit of `` boltzmann - grad gas '' ( `` infinitely dilute gas '' ) infinite bbgky hierarchy reduces to the single boltzmann equation , i.e. the latter presents exact gas kinetics .",
    "if such was the case , then random walk of a molecular bp ( e.g. test or marked gas atom ) would be made of many _ statistically independent _ events and pieces .",
    "then the `` _ law of large numbers _ '' is in effect , and probability distribution of the brownian path @xmath1 in thermodynamically equilibrium gas should have gaussian asymptotic ( [ vg ] ) .    but",
    "this is not true ! in fact , as we will show , @xmath5 has essentially non - gaussian asymptotic possessing power - law tails at @xmath6 instead of the exponential ones , even in equilibrium gas under the boltzmann - grad limit ( bgl ) .    hence , n.krylov was right , and _ statistical independency _ of colliding molecules or _ statistical independency _ of different pieces of brownian trajectory , etc . , like _ statistical independency _ of mathematical dice tosses , exists in imagination only but not in physical reality .",
    "if reinterpreting the well - known words said by einstein , one can say that he was playing dice in @xcite but god does not play dice .",
    "a substantiation of these statements below ( see also @xcite ) will be done `` at very thermodynamical level '' basing on only determinism and reversibility of hamiltonian microscopic dynamics and besides general notions about many - particle distribution functions and correlation functions @xcite and main fluid properties .    in spite of so abstract approach , remarkably",
    ", our conclusions will be in full qualitative agreement with result obtained in @xcite by means of crucial approximation of the bbgky hierarchy and then its direct solving under bgl : @xmath7 ( in @xcite designation @xmath8 was used in place of @xmath9 ) .",
    "the diffusivity @xmath10 here , as well as in ( [ vg ] ) , is defined by @xmath11 , while the arrow everywhere denotes asymptotic at @xmath3 much greater than bp s mean free - flight time .",
    "our plan is as follows . in the beginning",
    ", a kind of virial expansion for @xmath0 is derived .",
    "it connects , from one hand , first- and higher - order derivatives of @xmath5 with respect to gas density and , from the other hand , pair and many - particle joint correlation functions ( cf ) of bp and gas .",
    "the cf in their turn are definitely related to usual distribution functions ( df ) .",
    "since the latter by their sense are non - negative , the virial expansion results in a series of differential inequalities to be satisfied by @xmath0 .",
    "the first of them , eventually , restricts a steepness of @xmath12 s tails and clearly forbids their exponentially fast decrease . at the end of the paper , its relation to the problem of 1/f noise",
    "is commented .",
    "we will consider a system consisting of @xmath13 atoms in volume @xmath14 plus one more corpuscular `` brownian particle '' ( bp ) , under the thermodynamical limit : @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17const .",
    "initially , at time @xmath18 , position of bp @xmath19 is definitely known .",
    "we are interested in the already mentioned distribution @xmath0 of consequent bp s path @xmath20 .",
    "especially ( see introduction ) , in thermodynamically equilibrium boltzmann - grad gas where _ a fortiori _ any `` collective '' or `` hydrodynamic '' contributions to chaotic motion of particles disappear . at the same time , as far as possible , we want to take in mind also finite - density and non - equilibrium gas and even liquid .    instead of `` art of decomposition '' of bp s path into some constituent parts and `` art of conjecturing '' about their `` probabilities '' ,",
    "we want to follow n.krylov ( see introduction ) and consider a set of mental `` full - scale experiments '' to see how bp s path as a whole is influenced by artificial controllable perturbations of both gas and bp .",
    "thus we involve into consideration statistical correlations between bp s path and gas atoms . at that ,",
    "the only `` probability '' to be specified ( at our own choosing , without any conjectures ) is initial probabilistic measure in the space of states of the system . to find other `` probabilities '' , one should analyze a flow of this measure according to the liouville equation or equivalent bbgky equations . but a great deal can be found from time reversibility of this flow only which is expressed e.g. by the `` generalized fluctuation - dissipation relations '' ( fdr ) @xcite .",
    "let , firstly , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are ( canonical ) coordinates and momentums of our system , and @xmath23 its hamiltonian in absence of its perturbations , so that @xmath24 .",
    "secondly , the initial probabilistic measure , @xmath25 , is the equilibrium canonical one corresponding to this hamiltonian , that is @xmath26}\\,$ ] ( omitting a normalization factor ) .",
    "thirdly , suppose possibility that bp is perturbed by a constant external force @xmath27 which is sharply switched on at @xmath18 , thus at @xmath28 changing the hamiltonian to @xmath29",
    ".    then we can either directly write according to works @xcite or @xcite or derive by their methods , like in @xcite , the very particular but useful enough fdr as follows : @xmath30 here @xmath31\\,$ ] is work made by the external force during time interval @xmath2 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are `` arbitrary functions '' , the angle brackets @xmath34 designate averaging over statistical ensemble of phase trajectories of the system corresponding to the equilibrium gibbs ensemble of their initial conditions , and @xmath35 is initial temperature of the system ( or , to be precise , of the ensemble ) . at any concrete trajectory , of course ,",
    "@xmath36 and @xmath37 represent solutions to hamilton equations corresponding to the hamiltonian @xmath29 and hence are some functions of the force @xmath27 .",
    "the equality ( [ sim0 ] ) holds also if bp has internal degrees of freedom . in absence of external force ,",
    "when @xmath38 , it is so obvious that even does not need in a proof .",
    "further it is sufficient to confine ourselves by such particular choice as @xmath39}\\,\\\\\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\ , \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,=\\,\\omega\\,\\,\\delta({\\bf r}-{\\bf r}_0)\\,\\delta({\\bf p}-{\\bf p}_0)\\prod_{j\\,=1}^n [ 1+\\psi({\\bf r}_j,{\\bf p}_j)\\ , ] \\,\\,\\,,\\label{ch } \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath40}-1\\,$ ] .      under choice",

    "all the @xmath55 are complete analogues of standardly defined non - normalized many - particle df of infinite gas @xcite . instead of normalization ,",
    "`` asymptotic uncoupling '' of inter - particle correlations takes place : @xmath56 when @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively , with @xmath59 being equilibrium maxwellian distribution of atomic momentum , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 atomic mass .",
    "but , because of initial localization of bp , in respect to bp s variables all the df are normalized in literal sense .",
    "in particular , @xmath62 in respect to @xmath63 , expression @xmath64 represents generating functional for these df quite similar to the functional originally introduced by bogolyubov @xcite .    by definition of the average @xmath65 , all the df represent bp in initially thermodynamically equilibrium gas ( or , to be precise , in equilibrium gibbs ensemble of identical systems `` gas plus bp '' ) .",
    "correspondingly , initial conditions to them are @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 where @xmath69 @xmath70 functions @xmath71 are conditional equilibrium df of gas under fixed position of bp , @xmath72 is their generating functional , and @xmath73 means bp s mass .",
    "of course , all the df possess translational invariance .",
    "notice also that , firstly , ratios @xmath74 represent conditional df of gas under condition that both initial position of bp and its current state are known .",
    "secondly , al least under condition @xmath75 the infinite series are converging and hence the functionals are well defined",
    ".      in absence of the external force ( @xmath76 ) just listed df describe brownian motion in gas which all the time remains in exact thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "nevertheless , at @xmath28 not only @xmath55 but conditional df @xmath74 too are constantly changing along with @xmath9 . in principle , their joint evolution is unambiguously prescribed by the bbgky equations together with initial conditions ( [ ic0 ] ) and ( [ ic ] ) @xcite . at that",
    ", differences @xmath77 reflect additional specific statistical correlations between bp and gas which arise just due to evolution of @xmath47 .",
    "roughly , an origin of their specificity is that they are correlations of a current gas state with previous bp s path accumulated during all the time interval @xmath2 . by this reason we can characterize them as `` historical correlations '' .    by tradition , any additions to equilibrium ( or quasi - equilibrium ) df are termed `` correlation functions '' ( cf ) @xcite .",
    "we will apply this term also to functions what describe the `` historical correlations '' .",
    "let us designate cf as @xmath78 and introduce them through their generating functional : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is expressed through @xmath81 by formula ( [ fi ] ) , and @xmath82 @xmath83 according to this definition , in particular , @xmath84 where function @xmath85 represents pair `` historical '' correlation between bp and atoms .    in view of the asymptotic decoupling of inter - particle correlations",
    ", it is clear that all the cf disappear in initial equilibrium state , @xmath86 at @xmath87 , as well as far from bp , i.e. @xmath88 at @xmath89 .",

    ", therefore , right - hand side of ( [ r ] ) represents wholly equilibrium brownian motion .",
    "in other words , relation ( [ r ] ) connects two sorts of `` full - scale experiments '' : one on susceptibility of brownian motion to perturbations of medium where it takes place , and another on its correlations with thermal fluctuations in the medium . in such sense , ( [ r ] )",
    "is typical generalized fdr or `` generalized onsager relation '' .    at @xmath111 ,",
    "clearly , ( [ r ] ) turns into @xmath112/t } \\,=\\,v_0(t,{\\bf r}_0,-{\\bf p}_0|{\\bf r}^{\\prime})\\,\\,\\,,\\label{r00 } \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath113 is density of probability to find bp ( in the same gas as on the left ) at point @xmath114 under condition that it started from point @xmath49 with momentum @xmath50 .",
    "integration over this momentum yields the classical fdr @xcite @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117    of course , all the df and cf are dependent on the mean gas density @xmath118 ( and on the force @xmath27 if any ) but for brevity in ( [ r ] ) , as well as before it and almost everywhere below , corresponding arguments are omitted .",
    "let , firstly , the gas perturbation does not change velocity distribution of atoms , that is represents pure density perturbation , @xmath119 .",
    "secondly , @xmath120const inside some sphere @xmath121 and vanishes outside it in some suitable way ( it should be underlined that nothing impedes choosing perturbations to be correlated with the point @xmath49 ) . since , according to ( [ cond ] ) , @xmath122 is absolutely integrable , radius @xmath123 must be finite .",
    "but it can be as large as we want . at that",
    ", factual perturbation of gas equilibrium initially is located at @xmath124 .    for example",
    ", we may take @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is speed of sound in our gas ( or liquid ) , @xmath127 is maximal duration of our `` full - scale experiments '' , and @xmath128 . then",
    ", if the external force is not too strong ( so that velocity of bp s drift induced by the external force is small as compared with @xmath126 ) , we can be sure that at @xmath129 the brownian motion mentioned in left part of ( [ r ] ) practically takes place in equilibrium uniform gas with a constant mean density @xmath130const what corresponds to @xmath131const . indeed , under mentioned conditions @xmath132 while radial approach of inner front of the gas perturbation ( let even mach front ) to the point @xmath133 is not greater than @xmath134 .",
    "hence , undoubtedly bp does not feel the front and moves as it was in spatially uniform ( and thus equilibrium ) media at least till @xmath129 .",
    "this can be named `` quasi - uniform perturbation '' of gas .",
    "now , at @xmath129 , in fact both parts of ( [ r ] ) describe brownian motions in ( initially ) uniform equilibrium gases but with different values of density .",
    "on the right it is @xmath135 while on the left it equals to @xmath136 taken far from bp , at @xmath137 , with @xmath138 being radius of pair interaction between bp and atoms .",
    "we will denote this value simply as @xmath139 . according to ( [ n ] ) ,",
    "it is definite function of @xmath140 and the seed density @xmath135 : @xmath141\\,+\\,\\,\\,\\ , \\label{n1 } \\end{array}\\ ] ] @xmath142\\ , + ... \\,\\}\\ ] ] here @xmath143 and @xmath144 are standard pair and triple df of equilibrium gas with density @xmath118 ( i.e. functions what follow from @xmath145 at @xmath146 ) .",
    "correspondingly , the functional @xmath147 simplifies to mere function , and , integrating left side of ( [ r ] ) over @xmath50 , for @xmath129 we can write @xmath148 where @xmath9 has exactly the same sense as @xmath9 on the right - hand side of ( [ r ] ) ( after its integration over @xmath149 ) , and we introduced the density argument @xmath150 , so that @xmath151    on right - hand side of ( [ r ] ) , under the formulated conditions , _ a fortiori _ none correlations between bp and gas might propagate out of the sphere @xmath152 .",
    "therefore in all the integrals @xmath122 can be replaced by the constant .",
    "consequently , relation ( [ r ] ) , after its integration over @xmath149 , transforms into @xmath153 functions @xmath154 at @xmath155 defined by @xmath156 combining ( [ r2 ] ) with fdr ( [ r0 ] ) ( which , of course , is valid at any density if equal on both sides ) , we obtain @xmath157 where now @xmath158 .    relation ( [ ve ] ) thoroughly may be qualified as `` virial expansion '' of the bp s path probability distribution , @xmath159 , similarly to well - known virial expansions of thermodynamical quantities @xcite or kinetic coefficients @xcite .",
    "but there is significant mathematical difference between them : the two latter expand over absolute value of density @xmath139 while the former in fact over its relative value @xmath160 .",
    "first - order , in respect to @xmath102 , terms of ( [ ve ] ) produce @xmath161 here @xmath162 and , according to ( [ n ] ) and/or ( [ n1 ] ) , @xmath163_{\\psi = 0 } = \\,\\nu_0 + \\nu_0 ^ 2\\,\\int [ f_2^{(eq)}({\\bf r})-1\\,]\\,d{\\bf r}\\,=\\,\\nu_{\\,0}\\,t\\left(\\frac { \\partial \\nu_{\\,0}}{\\partial p}\\right)_t\\ , \\label{n2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , of course , @xmath164 is some function of @xmath135 . the last equality in ( [ n2 ] ) , with @xmath165 standing for the pressure and the bracket representing compressibility , is well known from statistical thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "notice that the function @xmath166 can be interpreted as total pair correlation of bp with whole gas but counted per ( elementary volume @xmath167 what falls at ) one gas atom .",
    "similar interpretation is applicable to higher - order integral correlations ( [ clim0 ] ) .",
    "returning to our basic relation ( [ r ] ) in the full phase space , in the first order with respect to @xmath63 we have @xmath168_{\\psi \\,=0}\\,g_m({\\bf p}_0)\\,\\,\\,e^{-\\,{\\bf f } \\cdot[\\,{\\bf r}^{\\,\\prime}-\\,{\\bf r}_0]/t } \\,=\\ , \\label{fo}\\ ] ] @xmath169 with the help of ( [ n ] ) , variational derivative with respect to @xmath63 can be replaced by that with respect to density of atoms in @xmath105-space : @xmath170_{\\psi \\,=0}\\,=\\,\\nu_{\\,0}g_m({\\bf p})\\,f_1^{(eq)}({\\bf r}|{\\bf r}_0)\\,\\frac { \\delta v}{\\delta \\mu({\\bf r},{\\bf p})}\\,+\\,\\nu_{\\,0}^2 g_m({\\bf p})\\,\\times \\label{fo1}\\ ] ] @xmath171 \\,\\,\\frac { \\delta v}{\\delta \\mu({\\bf r}^{\\,\\prime},{\\bf p}^{\\,\\prime})}\\,\\,d{\\bf r}^{\\,\\prime } d{\\bf p}^{\\,\\prime}\\ ] ] with the right - hand variational derivatives taken at @xmath172 , i.e. at equilibrium gas with the seed density @xmath118 .",
    "this generalizes ( [ n2 ] ) to arbitrary non - uniform perturbations .",
    "the two latter formulas establish quite rigorous connection of , from one hand , pair correlation between previous path of bp and current state of the medium where it is walking , and , from the other hand , linear susceptibility of the bp s path probability distribution to weak perturbations of the medium .",
    "our previous results clearly show that , firstly , historical correlations between bp and medium ( gas or liquid ) certainly exist , i.e. are not zeros . secondly , their total values ( integrated over all momenta and relative distances between atoms and bp as in ( [ clim0 ] ) ) quite definitely reflect sensitivity of the probabilistic law of brownian motion to change of state of the medium , first of all , to density of its atoms .    indeed , let the medium represents three - dimensional weakly non - ideal ( `` dilute '' ) gas in equilibrium ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "then , undoubtedly , an increase of gas density must lead to constriction of the distribution @xmath173 .",
    "thus its density derivative @xmath174 is positive at sufficiently small @xmath175 but negative at relatively large @xmath176 .",
    "since , undoubtedly again , auto - correlation of bp s velocity is integrable and therefore bp s chaotic walk is organized as `` diffusion '' considered already in @xcite , i.e. @xmath177 , @xmath178 , a bound what separates `` small '' and `` large '' values of @xmath176 is of order of @xmath179 .",
    "hence , we can state that @xmath180 when @xmath181 is significantly greater then unit .",
    "this implies , according to ( [ r21 ] ) , that total pair bp - gas correlation , @xmath182 , also is negative at large @xmath183 , and thus @xmath184 somewhere is negative .",
    "but it can not be `` too negative '' , because its contribution to right side of ( [ cf1 ] ) should not make its left side ( which represents probability distribution ) negative .",
    "this means , obviously , that the integral @xmath182 and thus the derivative @xmath185 is bounded below by some negative whose absolute value is proportional to @xmath186 .",
    "such restriction of the derivative , in its turn , means that tails of @xmath187 at @xmath188 can not decrease in too fast way .",
    "anyhow , possibility of exponential decrease of @xmath187 at @xmath189 and hence the gaussian asymptotic ( [ vg ] ) become under question .",
    "let us consider this suspicion carefully .      at any @xmath3 , @xmath114 , @xmath49 , @xmath149 and @xmath190 ,",
    "let @xmath191 assume that at given @xmath3 , @xmath114 , @xmath192 , @xmath50 and @xmath190 integral of @xmath193 over @xmath194 is negative ( i.e. @xmath195 ) .",
    "this means that @xmath196 also is negative , and therefore we can introduce effective volume occupied by negative pair correlation , @xmath197 , by means of @xmath198 clearly , this is lower boundary of volumes what could be reasonably attributed to the negative correlation . if , in opposite , the integral over @xmath194 is positive , in the same sense it is reasonable to assign @xmath199 . then in any case we can write @xmath200    next , pay our attention to identity ( [ cf1 ] ) .",
    "since the pair df @xmath201 represents a probability density , it must be non - negative , @xmath202 .",

    "it is useful to notice that @xmath208 , @xmath209 and therefore @xmath210 , if bp and an atom can not be located at same point .",
    "consequently , always @xmath211 .    combining inequalities ( [ in1 ] ) and ( [ in2 ] ) and relation ( [ r21 ] )",

    "let @xmath217 denotes at once a finite region in the @xmath218-space and volume of this region , presuming that it is centered near point @xmath49 .",
    "introduce @xmath219 as minimum of all those regions @xmath217 what satisfy @xmath220 with some fixed @xmath221 .",
    "that is @xmath222 represents minimal region containing at least @xmath223 percents of the total pair correlation .",
    "from the other hand , integrate identity ( [ cf1 ] ) over @xmath224 . in view of the non - negativeness of @xmath225 result",
    "must be non - negative : @xmath226 it is easy to verify that these two inequalities together imply a more interesting one : @xmath227 next , again let us replace here @xmath228 by @xmath204 ( which even improves the inequality ) , then perform integration over momentums , apply relation ( [ r21 ] ) and divide all by @xmath229 .",
    "this yields @xmath230 with characteristic average pair correlation volume defined by @xmath231    unlike ( [ av ] ) this characteristic volume has free parameter @xmath232 . at @xmath233 almost all pair correlation is taken into account . but to make inequality ( [ in5 ] ) most strong we have to minimize @xmath234 with respect to @xmath235 . from this point if view , a choice when @xmath236 can be preferred . at that , expectedly , @xmath237 is close to above defined @xmath238 if total pair correlation is negative .",
    "let us consider equilibrium and hence spherically symmetric brownian motion what takes place in absence of the external force ( @xmath239 ) .",
    "assume that at sufficiently large scales , when @xmath240 , with @xmath241 being bp s mean free - flight time , and @xmath242 with @xmath243 being bp s mean free path , the probability distribution of bp s path , @xmath244 , tends to the gaussian ( [ vg ] ) .",
    "then it depends on gas density by way of the bp s diffusivity @xmath10 only , and inequalities ( [ in4 ] ) or ( [ in5 ] ) produce , together with ( [ n2 ] ) , @xmath245v_g(t,\\delta{\\bf r})\\,\\geq\\,0\\,\\label{ga}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , respectively , @xmath246 in case of gas , certainly , bp s diffusivity is a decreasing function of the density , @xmath247 .",

    "as the consequence , inequality ( [ ga ] ) can be satisfied if and only if at large values of @xmath183 quantity @xmath249 grows at least proportionally to @xmath183 .",
    "notice that for not too dense gas ( all the more , for dilute one ) we can write @xmath250 and @xmath251 , where @xmath252 is characteristic thermal velocity of bp . besides , for molecular - size bp ( whose mass is comparable with atomic mass ) @xmath253 .",
    "this makes it obvious that limits of the quasi - uniform gas perturbation ( see section 2.5 ) practically allows arbitrary large values of @xmath183 , up to @xmath254 , where @xmath127 is total duration of the `` full - scale experiment ''",
    ". therefore inequality ( [ ga ] ) requires from @xmath249 and thus from @xmath255 , with @xmath256 being minimum of ( [ av ] ) and ( [ av1 ] ) , ability to achieve as large values as @xmath257 ( where @xmath127 , in its turn , is arbitrary large ) .    for dilute gas , more concretely , it is known that @xmath258 , @xmath259 , and @xmath260 , where @xmath138 is effective radius of bp - atom short - range repulsive interaction .",
    "consequently , @xmath261 , and ( [ ga ] ) satisfies only when @xmath262 at any @xmath183 .",
    "in fact , * we are faced with dilemma : either asymptotical statistics of brownian path is gaussian or volume of pair correlation is bounded above*.    what is better ? in the first variant , `` the law of large numbers '' and conventional stochastic picture of brownian motion hold true . but the strange enough requirement of unrestrictedly wide spatial statistical correlations indicates presence of self - contradictions in such theory . in the second variant , `` the law of large numbers '' does not work .",
    "but there are no nonphysical requirements and no contradictions .",
    "undoubtedly , we have to prefer this second variant and claim that brownian trajectory can not be imitated with the help of coin tossing or dice tossing or other `` statistically independent '' random events .      in order to make our consideration more pointed and _ a fortiori _ exclude from it any `` collective '' or `` hydrodynamic '' effects , a toy named `` the boltzmann - grad limit '' ( bgl ) is very useful . in this limit @xmath263",
    "while @xmath264 ( @xmath138 and @xmath265 are radii of short - range repulsive bp - atom and atom - atom interactions ) in such way that gas non - ideality parameters @xmath266 and @xmath267 vanish but mean free paths of of bp , @xmath268 , and atoms , @xmath269 , stay fixed . at that",
    ", bp collides with only infinitely small portion of atoms what surround it , therefore its previous collisions in no way can influence next ones .",
    "folklore of kinetics includes opinion that at least under bgl the boltzmann equation is true `` zero - order approximation '' for finite - density gas kinetics , and the corresponding boltzmann - lorentz equation ( see e.g. @xcite ) for molecular bp ( test atom or particle of rare impurity ) is exact zero - order approximation for molecular brownian motion . since this equation inevitably yields @xcite the gaussian asymptotic , a best chance to resolve above formulated dilemma in detail is to consider pair correlations in the course of the bgl . for simplicity ,",
    "again at @xmath76 .",
    "recall a few things about pair cf , @xmath270 , already known from conventional theory @xcite . in respect to relative distance between two particles ( in our case , bp and an atom ) , @xmath271",
    ", the pair correlation is accumulated inside a `` _ collision cylinder _ '' which has radius @xmath272 and is directed in parallel to relative velocity of the particles , @xmath273 .",
    "importantly , characteristic value of the pair cf in this cylinder is comparable with product of one - particle df . in our case",
    "this means that magnitude of @xmath270 ( in particular , above defined quantity @xmath274 ) is of order of first right - hand term in ( [ cf1 ] ) . as the consequence , magnitude of pair correlation , as well as @xmath275 , keeps safe under bgl , although inside more and more narrow _ collision cylinder _ only .    but what is spread of pair correlation along the cylinder",
    "? unfortunately , conventional theory never was interested in this issue , but in fact it reserves the spread to be infinite , at least at @xmath276 , i.e. for particles flying away after collision . as the consequence , integral @xmath277 , integral in ( [ r21 ] ) and corresponding correlation volumes all turn to infinity .",
    "this became possible since the theory @xcite neglected contributions from three - particle and other higher - order correlations , @xmath278 , @xmath279 , etc .",
    ", although they involve collisions of the pair under attention with `` third particles '' ( the rest of gas ) . that are not literally three - particle collisions but chains of ( actual or virtual ) pair collisions @xcite",
    "it is not too hard to look after that magnitude of @xmath280-order cf on corresponding sets in @xmath280-particle phase spaces at @xmath281 , like at @xmath282 , is of order of product of @xmath44 one - particles df irrespective to bgl .",
    "therefore , due to collisions with `` third particles '' , the pair correlation of bp with atoms disappears when @xmath283 significantly exceeds @xmath284 .",
    "stronger separated particles hardly are participants of forthcoming or happening mutual collision , even if they aim precisely one to another .    by neglecting all that",
    ", the theory unknowingly resolves the dilemma in favor of its first variant .",
    "that is why conventional kinetics , including the boltzmann equation , is not true `` zero - order approximation '' and contradicts the virial relations .",
    "in fact , according to above remarks , a spread of the pair correlation along collision cylinder is finite and characterized by minimum of mean free paths @xmath284 and @xmath285 .",
    "correspondingly , effective volume of the cylinder , or volume of pair correlation , @xmath286 , is finite value of order of @xmath287 ( assuming , for simplicity , @xmath288 ) , i.e. volume displayed per one atom .",
    "since our reasonings are irrespective to where and when pair collisions take place , the estimate @xmath289 is independent on @xmath3 and @xmath290 and at once is estimate of upper boundary of the correlation volume .",
    "let us consider this conclusion from the point of view of virial relations ( [ r ] ) , ( [ r2 ] ) with ( [ clim0 ] ) , ( [ ve ] ) , ( [ r21 ] ) and ( [ fo ] ) with ( [ fo1 ] ) .",
    "it is easy to make sure that on the way to bgl , at any fixed function @xmath122 , expressions ( [ n ] ) , ( [ n1 ] ) and ( [ n2 ] ) simplify to @xmath291\\,g_m({\\bf p})\\ ,   \\label{bgl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    since change of @xmath292 during bgl is compensated by change of @xmath293 and @xmath294 to keep constant @xmath284 and @xmath285 , left sides of ( [ r ] ) , ( [ r2 ] ) , ( [ ve ] ) and ( [ r21 ] ) become invariants of @xmath292 although keeping their dependence on @xmath102 .",
    "consequently , all coefficients in right - hand expansions into power series of @xmath102 become independent on @xmath292 . on the left ,",

    "obviously , this derivative represents reaction of probability distribution of bp s path , @xmath299 , to lodging , at @xmath18 , in point @xmath194 one extra atom with momentum @xmath190 .",
    "at that , importantly , it is presumed that this extra atom does not disturb initial equilibrium ( of the statistical ensemble ) , as if it was merely marked atom .",
    "far enough under bgl , of course , this lodging can have an effect at such initial relative disposition of bp and the extra atom only which results in their direct collision . hence , vector @xmath300 should belong to those part of the _ collision cylinder _ which corresponds either to particles in _ in_-state , i.e. flying one towards another , or to currently colliding ( interacting ) particles , i.e. separated by distance @xmath301 .",
    "besides , @xmath283 should not be much greater than @xmath302",
    ". otherwise collisions of either bp or extra atom with `` third particles '' ( other atoms ) will prevent the desired collision .",
    "this trivial notation once again , but more strikingly , highlights that volume occupied by the pair correlation on right - hand side of ( [ fo11 ] ) can be estimated ( at @xmath303 ) as @xmath304 irrespective to the bp s path . indeed , on the left in ( [ fo11 ] )",
    ", in view of the causality principle , a whole future path of bp can not influence possibility of its collision with concrete marked atom at very beginning of the path .",
    "moreover , the mentioned path and collision can not be mutually statistically correlated since the marked atom and bp deal with different non - intercrossing collections of `` third particles '' .",
    "therefore , any dependence of the right - hand pair cf on @xmath3 and @xmath1 characterizes its magnitude but not its spread .",
    "now we can say almost with confidence , that correlation volumes @xmath305 , @xmath306 and @xmath307 , introduced in sections 3.1 and 3.2 , have upper boundary @xmath308 independent on @xmath3 and @xmath1 or @xmath183 , and should be written simply as @xmath309 , @xmath310 and @xmath311 .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath249 in ( [ ga ] ) is not a function but a constant of order of unit .",
    "thus , the second resolution of the dilemma from section 3.3 is acceptable only .",
    "we can say that the god of mechanics does not play dice .",
    "he disposes of stronger means : hamiltonian dynamics of many particles ( @xmath312 , according to @xcite ) is able to create much more rich randomness than dice tossing can do .",
    "now we are ready to discuss what kind of asymptotic of bp s path distribution is really allowed instead of the gaussian one .    according to previous section ,",
    "let us rewrite inequalities ( [ in4 ] ) or ( [ in5 ] ) in the form @xmath313 here @xmath314 is a constant whose upper estimates obtained in two different ways look as @xmath315 with @xmath316 and @xmath317 being volumes of pair correlation ( volumes of collision ) defined by ( [ av ] ) and ( [ av1 ] ) and bounded above by a value @xmath318 ( volume per one atom ) , so that @xmath319 .",
    "probably , there are methods to estimate @xmath314 differently from sections 3.1 and 3.2 . anyway , to make inequality ( [ nga ] ) stronger , we should take minimum of all available estimates .    for simplicity ,",
    "consider equilibrium brownian motion at @xmath239 . in case of",
    "dilute enough gas , or even liquid in three or more dimensions , when hydrodynamical contributions to bp s velocity are far from domination , and the `` diffusion law '' @xmath320 holds , it seems natural if asymptotically , at @xmath321 , the bp s path distribution @xmath322 is characterized , similarly to @xmath323 , by a single parameter , that is diffusivity . for 3-d space ,",
    "@xmath324 here it is presumed that @xmath325 the first of these requirements is the normalization condition , while the second means that @xmath326 and in fact serves as quantitative definition of the diffusivity",
    ". then , inequality ( [ nga ] ) yields @xmath327 if diffusivity is a decreasing function of density , @xmath328 , and @xmath329 in opposite case @xmath330 .",
    "confining ourselves by the first case , we see that function @xmath331 must have power - law long tail : @xmath332 at @xmath333 , where @xmath334 . at that , in order to satisfy second of conditions ( [ pres ] ) , exponent @xmath335 should be greater than @xmath336 .",
    "example of such behavior , with maximally possible @xmath337 , is presented by @xmath338 where @xmath339 and @xmath340 .",
    "unpleasant aspect of such behavior is unboundedness of high enough statistical moments of @xmath341 .",
    "however , recall that real brownian motion in addition to diffusivity has at least one more important parameter , namely , the bp s thermal velocity @xmath342",
    ". then @xmath0 should be considered as a function of two dimensionless parameters , @xmath343 and @xmath344 , and asymptotically instead of ( [ as1 ] ) we can write @xmath345 here @xmath331 as before satisfies ( [ pres ] ) , while function @xmath346 at @xmath347 and fast enough tends to zero at @xmath348 thus sharply cutting @xmath0 when @xmath349 . this variant also is allowed by inequality ( [ nga ] ) , because @xmath342 is independent on density . and now all statistical moments of bp s are finite .",
    "nevertheless , from the point of view of higher - order moments , such asymptotic still is not exhaustive , excepting case of dilute gas . for sufficiently dense gas ( all the more , liquid ) we should take into account , at the minimum , such third ( density - dependent ) parameter as isothermal speed of sound , @xmath350 , with @xmath351 presented by ( [ n2 ] ) . at the same time , such complications practically do not change main probabilistic characteristics of bp s path , as well as its mean square behavior , and in no case cancel the long power - law tails .",
    "previous results , obtained from the first - order virial relations ( one- and two - particle cf ) only , are in remarkable qualitative ( and even semi - quantitative ) agreement with results obtained in @xcite from infinite chain of roughened bbgky equations describing a test ( marked ) gas atom in the role of bp in the boltzmann - grad gas .",
    "but , of course , our approach here could not give numeric value of exponent @xmath352 in ( [ as1 ] ) and ( [ ex ] ) .",

    "basic idea of @xcite , earlier suggested in @xcite ) , was to consider df averaged over `` collision boxes '' .",
    "the latter are just sets in @xmath280-particle phase spaces already mentioned in section 3.4 . for @xmath282 , `` collision box '' is nothing but above exploited `` collision cylinder '' . in general , `` collision box '' is a `` skeleton '' set of @xmath280-particle configurations snapped up from chains of @xmath395 connected ( actual or virtual ) collisions , under given input momenta .",
    "thorough description of all these sets hardly is possible , but hardly it is obligatory .",
    "much more important thing is that even under rough description one immediately discovers that the boltzmann - grad gas is true _",
    "terra incognita_.      let us return to identity ( [ fo11 ] ) .",
    "one and the same vector @xmath271 on its opposite sides belongs to opposite half of the _ collision cylinder_. hence , pair correlations on right - hand side are concentrated at _ out_-states ( i.e. concern particles flying away one from another ) and at central region of the cylinder ( i.e. concern also currently interacting particles , with @xmath396 ) , while _ in_-states are uncorrelated .",
    "this consequence of ( [ fo11 ] ) is in agreement with usual theory @xcite .",
    "the latter considers it as a good reason to believe in `` statistical independency '' of colliding particles ( boltzmann s `` molecular chaos '' ) .",
    "in present theory , however , actually colliding particles occupy central part of collision cylinder where , according to ( [ fo11 ] ) , @xmath397 is non - zero , and thus these particles are mutually correlated and statistically dependent .",
    "hence , statistical dependency is not `` exported from outside '' but occurs at the time of collision .",
    "the point is that @xmath206 ( as well as higher - order cf ) represents `` historical correlations '' ( see section 2.3 ) : it treats current collision as not a separate event but last term of long random sequence of bp s collisions with atoms on its way from @xmath99 to @xmath49 .",
    "therefore statistical dependencies involved by @xmath398 should be addressed not to currently colliding particles ( bp and atom ) themselves but to long - range fluctuations in relative frequency of bp s collisions .    with the purpose to make certain that this is only reasonable understanding of the correlations , in particular spatial ones",

    "in_-state or _",
    "out_-state of their mutual collision .",
    "consequently , ratio @xmath405 presents a measure of conditional probability of bp s collision under condition that path @xmath1 is known .",
    "the subscript `` _ post _ '' underlines that in essence this is _ a posteriori _ probability . in absence of historical correlations between bp and atoms",
    "we would have @xmath406 and above ratio would reduce to unconditional _ apriori _ probability measure : @xmath407 .    in conventional kinetics ,",
    "based on concepts like `` probability of collision '' , any difference between @xmath408 and @xmath409 is unthinkable since it means dependence of `` probability of collision '' on wherefrom bp had started in former times .",
    "therefore factual difference of @xmath408 from @xmath409 , indicated by the virial relations , says that a random point process formed by bp collisions in not a usual poisson process .",
    "then , what is it ?",
    "the answer is rather obvious : it is poisson process but supplied with such ( relatively slow ) scaleless random variations of `` probability of collision '' which exclude possibility to get it by time averaging .",
    "indeed , on second thought it is clear that poissonian statistics introduces `` too strict disorder '' in collisions to be likely",
    ".    such interpretation of inter - particle correlations which keep safe even under bgl was expounded in @xcite ( besides , it was in part developed in @xcite , and its most principal aspects were anticipated already in @xcite ) .",
    "it was demonstrated that fluctuations in `` probability of collision '' ( or , more precisely , relative frequency of collisions ) possess scaleless 1/f - type spectrum ( i.e. represent `` 1/f - noise '' ) and may be described also as 1/f fluctuations of bp s diffusivity ( and mobility ) .",
    "now we arrived at principally same results after start from virial relations .",
    "scaleless character of the fluctuations is due to fact that the system under consideration constantly forgets history of bp s collisions and therefore has neither stimulus nor means to force relative frequency of collisions to be certain . to keep it certain at arbitrary large time scales ,",
    "the system , in opposite , should keep in mind arbitrary old history . in this sense , _ a priori _ equalization of @xmath408 and @xmath409 acts as infinitely long memory .",
    "notice that in comparison with poissonian statistics of collisions a real one to some extent resembles bose statistics .",
    "now let us compare @xmath408 and @xmath409 .",
    "from section 3.5 it follows that sign of @xmath193 is determined by @xmath3 and @xmath1 only . taking this into account ,",
    "in the spirit of section 3.2 we can derive one more inequality , @xmath410 ) it implies that @xmath411 when @xmath412 .",
    "when , in opposite , @xmath413 , then both inequality signs in ( [ sin ] ) should be inverted .",
    "inequality ( [ sin ] ) represents strengthened form of ( [ r21 ] ) . at tails of @xmath414 always @xmath415 , and",
    "it shows that , naturally , _ a posteriori _ probability of bp s collisions far enough at tails is smaller than _ a priori _ one .",
    "notice that if @xmath314 was an exact value , determined by minimum of all possible estimates of pair correlation volume ( see section 3.6 and above ) , then middle expression in ( [ sin ] ) would achieve its theoretical minimum too .",
    "hence , in fact left inequality should be replaced by equality .",
    "similar conclusion is valid also in respect to its alternative at @xmath413 .",
    "thus we can write @xmath416 the last equality here relates to the boltzmann - grad gas . for distribution ( [ ngl ] ) or",
    "( [ sup ] ) , @xmath417 so substantial changeability of the _ a posteriori _ `` probability of collision '' shows that in fact this quantity has no certain value obtainable by time averaging .",
    "being guided by wrong idea of `` statistical independency '' of colliding particles ( boltzmann s `` molecular chaos '' ) , classical gas kinetics neglected statistical inter - particle correlations which inevitably arise in spatially non - uniform gibbsian statistical ensembles .",
    "thus the concept of _ a priori _ definable `` probability of collision '' was unknowingly imposed on the theory as characteristics of a concrete particle trajectory . as for brownian motion ( self - diffusion ) of gas particles ,",
    "the result was `` the law of large numbers '' stating that probability distribution @xmath418 of path of molecular brownian particle ( bp ) is drawn towards the gaussian distribution .",
    "we derived exact virial expansion connecting response of @xmath414 to gas perturbations , from one hand , and pair and many - particle `` historical '' statistical correlations between the bp s path and gas , from the other hand .",
    "specificity of `` historical '' correlations is that they are just products of initial spatial non - uniformity of an ensemble .",
    "thus existence of such correlations is proved . at the same time",
    ", we showed that finiteness of spatial spread of these correlations is incompatible with gaussian asymptotic of @xmath414 even in dilute gas ( under the boltzmann - grad limit ) .",
    "then we demonstrated that the spread is really finite and , consequently , @xmath414 has essentially non - gaussian form , with power - law long tails ( lasting up @xmath419 ) .",
    "these results mean ( i ) that bp s path can not be divided into `` statistically independent '' events or pieces , and , as combined with our previously published @xcite and unpublished @xcite results , ( ii ) that `` probability of collision '' or , equivalently , diffusivity ( and mobility ) of bp in fact undergo scaleless fluctuations like the so - called 1/f - noise .    in principle",
    ", these conclusions extend to the kinetics as the whole .",
    "if applied to charge carriers in semiconductors , they naturally explain the `` inherent 1/f - noise '' under experimental investigation during many years @xcite .",
    "however , one has to revise kinetics of electron - phonon systems ( as well as phonon systems themselves @xcite ) , again removing from it _ a priori _ `` probability of collision '' and `` statistical independencies '' , and returning to honest analysis of infinite chains of many - particle statistical correlations .",
    "perhaps , a time of such revision is not far off .",
