    "in this paper , we present a collaborative control strategy for a class of autonomous underwater vehicles ( auvs ) to track the coherent structures and manifolds on flows . in realistic ocean flows , these time - dependent coherent structures , or lagrangian coherent structures ( lcs ) ,",
    "are similar to separatrices that divide the flow into dynamically distinct regions .",
    "lcs are extensions of stable and unstable manifolds to general time - dependent flows @xcite , and they carry a great deal of global information about the dynamics of the flows . for two - dimensional ( 2d ) flows ,",
    "lcs are analogous to ridges defined by local maximum instability , and quantified by local measures of finite - time lyapunov exponents ( ftle ) @xcite .",
    "recently , lcs have been shown to coincide with optimal trajectories in the ocean which minimize the energy and the time needed to traverse from one point to another @xcite .",
    "furthermore , to improve weather and climate forecasting , and to better understand various physical , chemical , and geophysical processes in the ocean , there has been significant interest in the deployment of autonomous sensors to measure a variety of quantities of interest .",
    "one drawback to operating sensors in time - dependent and stochastic environments like the ocean is that the sensors will tend to escape from their monitoring region of interest .",
    "since the lcs are inherently unstable and denote regions of the flow where more escape events may occur @xcite , knowledge of the lcs are of paramount importance in maintaining a sensor in a particular monitoring region .",
    "existing work in cooperative boundary tracking for robotic teams that relies on one - dimensional ( 1d ) parameterizations include  @xcite and  @xcite for static and time - dependent cases respectively .",
    "formation control strategies for distributed estimation of level surfaces and scalar fields in the ocean are presented in  @xcite and pattern formation for surveillance and monitoring by robot teams is discussed in  @xcite .",
    "our work is distinguished from existing work in that we use cooperative robots to find coherent structures without requiring a global picture of the ocean dynamics .",
    "we take inspiration from @xcite and design a strategy to enable a team of robots to track the stable / unstable manifolds of general 2d conservative flows through local sensing alone .",
    "we verify the feasibility of our method through simulations and experiments and show how the proposed strategy can be extended to track coherent structures in time - dependent conservative flows with measurement noise . to our knowledge , this is the first attempt in the development of tracking strategies for mapping lcs in the ocean using auvs .",
    "the novelty of this work lies in the use of nonlinear dynamical and chaotic system analysis techniques to derive a tracking strategy for a team of robots .",
    "the cooperative control strategy leverages the spatio - temporal sensing capabilities of a team of networked robots to track the boundaries separating the regions in phase space that support distinct dynamical behavior .",
    "additionally , our boundary tracking relies solely on local measurements of the velocity field .",
    "our technique is quite general , and may be applied to any conservative flow .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : we formulate the problem and outline key assumptions in section [ sec : probform ] .",
    "the cooperative control strategy is presented in section [ sec : method ] and its theoretical properties analyzed in section [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "section [ sec : results ] presents our simulation and experimental results .",
    "the extension of the proposed strategy to a noisy time - dependent model of a wind - driven double - gyre is presented in [ sec : doublegyre ] .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of our results and directions for future work in sections [ sec : discuss ] and [ sec : future ] respectively .",
    "we consider the problem of controlling a team of @xmath0 planar auvs to collaboratively track the material lines that separate regions of flow with distinct fluid dynamics .",
    "this is similar to the problem of tracking the stable ( and unstable ) manifolds of a general nonlinear dynamical system where the manifolds separate regions in phase space with distinct dynamical behaviors .",
    "we assume the following 2d kinematic model for each of the auvs :    [ eq : kinematics ] @xmath1 @xmath2    where @xmath3^t$ ] is the vehicle s planar position , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the vehicle s linear speed and heading , and @xmath6^t$ ] is the velocity of the fluid current experienced / measured by the @xmath7 vehicle .",
    "additionally , we assume each agent can be circumscribed by a circle of radius @xmath8 , _ i.e. _ , each vehicle can be equivalently described as a disk of radius @xmath8 .    in this work , @xmath9 is provided by a 2d planar conservative vector field described by a differential equation of the form @xmath10 in essence , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the stable and unstable manifolds of .",
    "in general , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the separating boundaries between regions in phase space with distinct dynamics . for 2d flows , @xmath15 are simply one - dimensional curves where @xmath16 denotes either stable ( @xmath17 ) or unstable ( @xmath18 ) boundaries . for a small region centered about a point on @xmath15 ,",
    "the system is unstable in one dimension .",
    "finally , let @xmath19 denote the radius of curvature of @xmath15 and assume that the minimum of the radius of curvature @xmath20 .",
    "this last assumption is needed to ensure the robots do not lose track of the @xmath15 due to sharp turns .",
    "the objective is to develop a collaborative strategy to enable a team of robots to track @xmath15 in general 2d planar conservative flow fields through local sampling of the velocity field .",
    "while the focus is on the development of a tracking strategy for @xmath13 , the proposed method can be easily extended to track @xmath14 since @xmath14 are simply stable manifolds of for @xmath21 .",
    "we present our methodology in the following section .",
    "our methodology is inspired by the proper interior maximum ( pim ) triple procedure @xcite  a numerical technique designed to find stationary trajectories in chaotic regions with no attractors .",
    "while the original procedure was developed for chaotic dynamical systems , the approach can be employed to reveal the stable set of a saddle point of a general nonlinear dynamical system .",
    "the procedure consists of iteratively finding an appropriate pim triple on a saddle straddling line segment and propagating the triple forward in time .",
    "we briefly summarize the procedure in the following section and refer the interested reader to @xcite for further details .      given the dynamical system described by ,",
    "let @xmath22 be a closed and bounded set such that @xmath23 does not contain any attractors of .",
    "given a point @xmath24 , the escape time of @xmath25 , denoted by @xmath26 , is the time @xmath25 takes to leave the region @xmath23 under the differential map .",
    "let @xmath27 be a line segment that crosses the stable set @xmath13 in @xmath23 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the endpoints of the @xmath27 are on opposite sides of @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath28 denote a set of three points in @xmath27 such that @xmath29 denotes the interior point .",
    "then @xmath28 is an _ interior maximum _",
    "triple if @xmath30 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath28 is a _ proper interior maximum _ ( pim ) triple if it is an interior maximum triple and the interval @xmath31 $ ] in @xmath27 is a proper subset of @xmath27 .",
    "then the numerical computation of any pim triple can be obtained iteratively starting with an initial saddle straddle line segment @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath33 and @xmath34 denote the endpoints of @xmath32 and apply an @xmath35 discretization of @xmath32 such that @xmath36 .",
    "for every point @xmath37 , determine @xmath38 by propagating @xmath37 forward in time using .",
    "then the pim triple in @xmath32 is given by the the points @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "this pim triple can then be further refined by choosing @xmath41 to be the line segment containing @xmath42 and reapplying the procedure with another @xmath43 discretization where @xmath44 .",
    "given an initial saddle straddling line segment @xmath32 , it has been shown that the line segment given by any subsequent pim triple on @xmath32 is also a saddle straddling line segment @xcite . furthermore",
    ", if we use a pim triple @xmath45 as the initial conditions for the dynamical system given by and propagate the system forward in time by @xmath46 , then the line segment containing the set @xmath47 , @xmath48 , remains a saddle straddle line segment .",
    "as such , the same numerical procedure can be employed to determine an appropriate pim trip on @xmath48 .",
    "this procedure can be repeated to eventually reveal the entire stable set @xmath49 and unstable set @xmath50 within @xmath23 if time was propagated forwards and backwards respectively .",
    "furthermore , since the procedure always begins with a valid saddle straddling line segment , by construction , the procedure always results in a non - empty set .    inspired by the pim triple procedure",
    ", we propose a cooperative _ saddle straddle _",
    "control strategy for a team of @xmath51 robots to track the stable ( and unstable ) manifolds of a general conservative time - independent flow field @xmath52 .",
    "different from the procedure , our robots will solely rely on information that can be gathered via local sensing and shared through the network .",
    "in contrast , a straight implementation of the pim triple procedure would require global knowledge of the structure of the system dynamics throughout a given region given its reliance on computing escape times .",
    "we describe our approach in the following section .",
    "consider a team of three robots and identify them as robots @xmath53 . while the robots may be equipped with similar sensing and actuation capabilities , we propose a heterogeneous cooperative control strategy .",

    "assume that @xmath55 lies on the line segment @xmath32 where @xmath32 is a saddle straddle line segment and @xmath56 constitutes a pim triple .",
    "similar to the pim triple procedure , the objective is to enable the robots to maintain a formation such that a valid saddle straddle line segment can be maintained between robots @xmath57 and @xmath58 . instead of computing the escape times for points on @xmath32 as proposed by the pim triple procedure",
    ", robot @xmath59 must remain close to @xmath13 using only local measurements of the velocity field provided by the rest of the team .",
    "as such , we refer to robot @xmath59 as the tracker of the team while robots @xmath57 and @xmath58 maintains a _ straddle formation _ across the boundary at all times .",
    "robots @xmath57 and @xmath58 may be thought of herding robots , since they control and determine the actions of the tracking robot .",
    "the controller for the straddling robots consists of two discrete states : a passive control state , @xmath60 , and an active control state , @xmath61 .",
    "the robots initialize in the passive state @xmath60 where the objective is to follow the flow of the ambient vector field .",
    "therefore , @xmath62 for @xmath63 .",
    "robots execute @xmath60 until they reach the maximum allowable separation distance @xmath64 from robot @xmath59 . when @xmath65 , robot @xmath66 switches to the active control state , @xmath61 , where the objective is to navigate to a point @xmath67 on the current _ projected _ saddle straddle line segment @xmath68 such that @xmath69 and @xmath70 denotes the midpoint of @xmath68 . when robots execute @xmath61 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the angle between the desired , @xmath74 , and current heading , @xmath9 , of robot @xmath66 as shown in fig .",

    "robot @xmath59 is then tasked to use these measurements to track the position of @xmath49 .",
    "let @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath79 denote the current velocity measurements obtained by robots @xmath57 ,",
    "@xmath59 , and @xmath58 at their respective positions .",
    "let @xmath80 denote the euclidean distance function and assume that @xmath81 such that @xmath82 is small .",

    "since has @xmath89 continuity and if @xmath29 is @xmath90-close to @xmath13 , then the point @xmath91 should be @xmath92-close to @xmath13 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 is a small enough positive constant .    while there are numerous vector field interpolation techniques available @xcite , we employ the _ inverse distance weighting method _ described in @xcite .",
    "for a given set of velocity measurements @xmath95 and corresponding position estimates @xmath96 , the velocity vector at some point @xmath97 is given by @xmath98 where @xmath99 .",

    "i.e. _ , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and so on , where @xmath103 is the sampling period and @xmath104 .",

    "the term @xmath109 is included to ensure that the control strategy aims for a point in front of robot @xmath59 rather than behind it .",

    ", we must show that at time @xmath120 , robots @xmath57 and",
    "@xmath58 remain on opposite sides of @xmath13 .",
    "consider the rate of change of the following function @xmath121 the above expression is simply one half the square of the distance between robots @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",

    "our work is novel in that the robots are determining the location of a global structure based solely on local information , and as far as we know , the sensing of lcs in the ocean has never been performed using autonomous vehicles .",

    "in recent years , there has been significant interest in the use of auvs to collect scientific data in the ocean to improve our ability to forecast harmful algae blooms and weather and climate patterns .",

    ", the ability to identify and track lagrangian coherent structures ( lcs ) in these dynamic environments is paramount in maintaining appropriate sensor coverage in regions of interest .",

    "specifically , can we extend our current cooperative tracking strategy to a swarm of heterogenous mobile and stationary sensors ? by increasing the team size and incorporating both stationary and mobile sensing devices , it is possible to refine our tracking technique to reveal the coherent structures at various spatial and time scales .",
