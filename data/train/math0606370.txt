    "applications are given to the following combinatorial - probabilistic problems : the enumeration of permutations with distinct cycle lengths , the probability that two permutations have the same cycle - length profile , the number of permutations admitting an @xmath1th root , the probability that a polynomial over a finite field has factors of distinct degrees , and the number of forests composed of trees of different sizes .",
