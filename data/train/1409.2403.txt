    "interest in empirical potential energy functions of diatomic molecules has remained unabated ever since the inception of the celebrated morse potential @xcite , proposed nearly 85 years ago .",
    "this three - parameter , exponentially varying function has inspired numerous works in the direction of constructing a universal energy - distance relationship , having varied number of parameters . in recent years",
    "there has been an upsurge of interest in this direction .",
    "thus , an enormous number of publications exist in the literature spanning over several decades .",
    "some of the most prominent ones include morse @xcite , rydberg @xcite , pschl - teller @xcite , manning - rosen potential in 3d @xcite , in higher dimension @xcite , in relativistic domain @xcite and scattering states @xcite , rosen - morse @xcite , wood - saxon @xcite , pseudoharmonic potential @xcite in 2d @xcite , kratzer @xcite , hulthn @xcite , hyperbolic @xcite , linnett @xcite , lippincott @xcite , tietz @xcite , schlberg @xcite , zavitsas @xcite , hajigeorgiou @xcite , along with many other variants of these and numerous others .",
    "in this work , we focus on the important deng - fan ( df ) potential @xcite for diatomic molecules , proposed little more than half a century ago , but attracting much interest lately , @xmath5 the three positive parameters @xmath6 denote dissociation energy , equilibrium internuclear distance and the radius of potential well respectively .",
    "it shows qualitatively correct asymptotic behavior as internuclear distance tends towards zero and infinity . because of the qualitative similarity with morse potential",
    ", this is also often termed as generalized morse potential @xcite . besides",
    ", this is also related to the well - known manning - rosen potential @xcite and has found interesting applications in molecular spectroscopy as well as electronic transitions . employing this potential ,",
    "transition frequencies and intensities of overtones of x - h stretching vibrations in small molecules were calculated and compared with morse potential @xcite .    as with many other potentials of interest in physical , chemical systems ,",
    "_ exact _ analytical solution of this potential for _ arbitrary _ quantum states has not been found as yet .",
    "therefore , several theoretical attempts have been made to approximate the nature of solutions of this potential in relativistic and non - relativistic domain .",
    "for example , the exact solvability problem was discussed by means of an @xmath7 symmetry algebra @xcite .",
    "later , eigenvalues , eigenfunctions for @xmath8 were investigated by the @xmath9 algebraic method @xcite .",
    "about a decade later , approximate analytical solutions of schrdinger equation with rotating df potential for arbitrary @xmath10 states were presented in terms of the generalized hypergeometric functions @xmath11 @xcite . in another development ,",
    "an improved approximation scheme was used for the centrifugal term , along with a super - symmetric shape invariance approach @xcite . then , using a super - symmetric shape invariance formalism , approximate analytic solution of the dirac equation with df potential has been given @xcite .",
    "bound state solutions of the klein - gordon equation with rotating df potential has been presented as well lately for spinless particle @xcite .",
    "analytic solutions of the klein - gordon and dirac equation in a rotating df potential is given by a pekeris approximation of the centrifugal term and a nikiforov - uvarov method @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been recently demonstrated that , for a set of 16 diatomic molecules manning - rosen , schlberg and df potentials perform very closely to the traditional morse potential ( and not showing any significant improvement over it ) in terms of spectroscopic parameters , even though the latter follows qualitatively correct asymptotic behavior @xcite .",
    "recently , the df potential , shifted by the dissociation energy , has been used for molecules @xcite , @xmath12 , \\ \\ \\ \\ b = e^{a r_e } -1.\\ ] ] the shifted df ( sdf ) potential in eq .",
    "( 2 ) resembles the behavior of morse potential for large @xmath13 regions ( @xmath14 ) , but differs at @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , deep df and sdf potentials ( @xmath16 ) , can be approximated by harmonic oscillator in the @xmath17 region @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to investigate the bound - state spectra of df - type potential for _ arbitrary _ quantum numbers @xmath10 , as well as for both _ low and high _ states .",
    "although some decent results are available @xcite , there is a need of systematic analysis in terms of accurate eigenvalues , eigenvalues and other relevant quantities , especially for the situations mentioned above . for this",
    "we employ the generalized pseudospectral method ( gps ) , which has been very successful for a number of physically important quantum systems , such as , spiked harmonic oscillator , rational , hulthn , yukawa , logarithmic , power - law , morse potential as well as static and dynamic studies in molecules and atoms ( including rydberg states ) , etc . @xcite",
    "thus , at first , a detailed study is presented on the bound states of df potential covering 36 states corresponding to vibrational quantum number up to @xmath18 . a thorough variation of energies with respect to the parameters @xmath19 is monitored .",
    "then it is extended for ro - vibrational levels ( belonging to both low and high @xmath20 ) within sdf potential , for four diatomic molecules , namely , h@xmath1 , lih , hcl and co. this will also broaden the range of applicability and feasibility of gps method for a larger class of complicated molecular potential functions .",
    "comparison with existing literature data is made wherever possible .",
    "general qualitative behavior of ro - vibrational energies obtained from this potential is also briefly contrasted with those from the familiar morse potential .",
    "the article is organized as follows : a brief account of the employed gps method is provided in section ii .",
    "section iii gives results and discussion , while a few concluding remarks are noted in section v.",
    "in this section , we briefly outline the gps formalism for solving the non - relativistic schrdinger equation of a hamiltonian containing a df potential .",
    "only the essential steps are given ; relevant details may be found in previous works @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "atomic units are employed throughout the article , unless otherwise mentioned .",
    "the desired radial schrdinger equation to be solved , can be written in following form , @xmath21 \\psi_{n,\\ell}(r ) = e_{n,\\ell}\\ \\psi_{n,\\ell}(r)\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is df or sdf potential , given in eq .",
    "( 1 ) or ( 2 ) . here",
    "@xmath3 , @xmath4 signify the usual radial and angular momentum quantum numbers respectively .",
    "the characteristic feature of gps method lies in the fact that it facilitates the use of a _ non - uniform , optimal _ spatial discretization leading to a coarser mesh at larger @xmath13 and denser mesh at smaller @xmath13 , while maintaining similar accuracy at both these regions .",
    "thus it enables one to work with a significantly smaller number of grid points yet providing accurate results quite efficiently .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the usual finite - difference schemes , which require considerably larger grid points , presumably because of their uniform discretization nature .    at first , a function @xmath23 defined in the interval @xmath24 $ ] , is approximated by an n - th order polynomial @xmath25 , as given below , @xmath26 which guarantees that the approximation is _ exact _ at the _ collocation points _",

    "now an algebraic nonlinear mapping of the following type can be introduced , @xmath40 with l , @xmath41 being two mapping parameters . then applying a symmetrization procedure , one obtains , after some straightforward algebra , the following transformed hamiltonian , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is given by , @xmath44 the advantage is that now one deals with a _",

    "the above variations in energy for molecules are depicted in fig .",

    "the lower ( a ) and upper ( b ) panels on the left hand side correspond to such changes in energy as the vibrational quantum number @xmath3 varies , for h@xmath1 and lih respectively . in both cases ,",
    "six values of @xmath4 are chosen , i.e. , @xmath51 .",
    "note that in h@xmath1 , the @xmath3 scale goes to 15 , whereas for lih , the same is shown up to 25 .",
    "this is because of the fact that , this potential supports a limited number of bound states only ; these are available in lesser number in h@xmath1 than in lih .",
    "the bottom ( c ) and top ( d ) segments on the right side , likewise , show energy variations with respect to angular quantum number @xmath4 .",
    "these are given for five @xmath52 and six @xmath53 values of @xmath3 , for h@xmath1 and lih respectively .",
    "for a given molecule , @xmath54 versus @xmath4 tends to attain a straight line - like behavior for higher and higher @xmath3 ; similarly @xmath54 versus @xmath3 also approaches a linear behavior for progressively higher @xmath4 . in moving from h@xmath1 to lih",
    ", the @xmath54 versus @xmath3 tends to become more closely spaced , whereas the @xmath54 versus @xmath4 remain well distinctly separated , although the rate of change slows down bringing some flatness in to the picture .",
    "the general qualitative features of these plots remain quite similar for the other two molecules , hcl and co. @xmath55 versus @xmath3 in hcl remains very close to that of lih , while for co , the individual @xmath4 plots become _ much closer _ to each other and assuming almost linear behavior , much like the way in @xcite for morse potential . the @xmath54 versus @xmath4 plot of hcl ,",
