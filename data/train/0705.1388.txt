    "the resonance has been studied extensively for quite a long time  @xcite .",
    "it appears in almost every field of physics from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics . in spite of this fact ,",
    "however , many fundamental aspects remain to be investigated . particularly in condensed - matter and statistical physics",
    ", many textbooks indeed introduce the complex eigenvalue of the resonant state only phenomenologically .",
    "meanwhile , the resonant phenomenon is of increasing importance especially in the quantum mechanics of mesoscopic devices .",
    "when we use nano - devices , we inevitably attach leads to them .",
    "hence the devices are always open systems and have resonant states ; an electron comes into the device through a lead , is trapped in the confining potential of the device for a while with a finite lifetime , and may come out through another lead .",
    "this resonant conduction has been intensely studied experimentally ; for example , the fano resonance  @xcite has attracted much attention .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study the resonant state of the open quantum system in two parts . in the first part , from section  [ sec2 ] to section  [ sec4 ] , we discuss the physical significance of the imaginary part of the resonant eigenvalue in a somewhat pedagogical manner , having in view condensed - matter and statistical physicists as a target reader . in the course of presenting our results in various places , we have often received many questions regarding the well - established knowledge on the resonant state from condensed - matter and statistical physicists , and hence we find it necessary to review here fundamental properties of the resonant state for self - containedness .",
    "we nevertheless include two new points in the discussions .",
    "first , we show that    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the imaginary part of the energy expectation is proportional to a momentum flux going out of the system for _ arbitrary _ wave functions .",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    the relation has appeared in the literature but for _ each _ resonant state  @xcite , in which case the imaginary part of the energy expectation is reduced to the lifetime , or the half - width of the resonance and the momentum flux is reduced to the real part of the wave number of the eigenstate .",
    "second , we show that    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the number of particles in a resonant state is _ conserved _ when we count the number in an expanding volume . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    the resonant state represents a decaying state and its particle number decreases exponentially , _ if we count the number in a fixed volume_. since the decay rate is related to the outgoing momentum flux as stated above , we can keep track of leaking particles by expanding the integration volume constantly .",
    "as far as we know , the above fact has never been stated in the literature albeit its simpleness .    in the second part of the present paper , from section  [ sec5 ] to section  [ sec6 ]",
    ", we introduce new numerical methods of treating the resonant state with the use of the effective potential  @xcite .",
    "a logical consequence of the arguments in sections  [ sec2 ] and  [ sec3 ] is that the eigenfunction of the resonant state is diverging away from the scattering potential .",
    "for this reason , treating resonant states numerically can involve difficulties .",
    "naive treatment by chopping off the infinite space would fail inevitably ; the resonant state never appears in a closed system and the diverging eigenfunction is never represented in a finite space .",
    "a conventional way is suppressing the divergence by the complex scaling , or the complex rotation  @xcite .",
    "we here use the effective potential , an energy - dependent boundary condition , in order to cut off the infinite space .",
    "we can thereby find resonance poles in the complex energy plane , working in a finite space .",
    "the present method seeks the energy eigenvalue iteratively .",
    "we numerically demonstrate for a simple model that we can indeed find a complex eigenvalue of the resonance pole .",
    "we found that our method is a rapidly converging method as in the kam theory  @xcite in nonlinear dynamics or in the newton method of finding the solution of the nonlinear equation ; _ i.e. _  the convergence is exponential with respect to the iteration step .",
    "we can also compute the time evolution of the resonant state in a finite space .",
    "we numerically demonstrate for the friedrichs model that we calculate the dynamics of the central part of the diverging resonant eigenfunction .",
    "numerical calculations for a ladder lattice finding a quasi - stable resonant states with very long lifetime will be reported elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "in the present section , we show that the imaginary part of the energy expectation is proportional to the flux out of a volume as well as the lifetime of the resonant state . thus the energy is generally complex in an open quantum system .",
    "the relation has been obtained only for each resonant state previously .",
    "hereafter , we discuss the one - dimensional case just for explanatory simplicity",
    ". see appendix  [ appa-1 ] for the corresponding expressions in the three - dimensional case .",
    "consider the one - dimensional one - body hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 we assume that the potential operator @xmath2 has a finite support @xmath3 that is , we assume that the potential function is reasonably localized around the origin .",
    "we also assume that the potential operator is hermitian ; in other words , the potential function is real : @xmath4 we will see below that the kinetic energy is not necessarily a hermitian operator .      let us check whether the hamiltonian  ( [ eq2 - 10 ] ) is a hermitian operator or not .",
    "we can do this by seeing whether the expectation value of the hamiltonian operator is real for an arbitrary wave function @xmath5 .",
    "we define the hamiltonian expectation as follows : @xmath6 note here that the volume of the integration is limited to a segment @xmath7 that includes the support of the potential operator @xmath2 ; that is , we assume @xmath8 , or @xmath9 .",
    "the reason for the trick of limiting the integration volume will be self - evident below .",
    "the usual definition of the expectation is recovered in the infinite - segment limit after normalization : @xmath10    we now compute the imaginary part of the expectation , @xmath11 and see in what case it remains . owing to the assumption that the potential is a real and localized function ,",
    "the expectation of the potential term is real .",
    "only the kinetic term therefore contributes to eq .",

    "( [ eq2 - 70 ] ) is real .",
    "the second term can be complex , however , which yields the imaginary part of the hamiltonian expectation .",
    "subtracting from eq .",
    "( [ eq2 - 70 ] ) its complex conjugate , we have @xmath13_{x =- l}^{l } \\nonumber\\\\ & = & -\\frac{i\\hbar}{m } \\mathop{\\mathrm{re } } \\left ( \\psi(x)^\\ast \\hat{p}\\psi(x ) \\bigr|_{x = l } - \\psi(x)^\\ast \\hat{p}\\psi(x ) \\bigr|_{x =- l } \\right ) , \\quad\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the momentum operator .",
    "in light of generalizing the expression to higher - dimensional cases , we denote the last line as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the normal component of the momentum on the surface @xmath17 .",
    "this represents the momentum flux going out of the segment @xmath18 .",
    "thus we arrive at @xmath19 this is a very insightful formula in analyzing resonant states .",
    "we have shown this general result for arbitrary wave functions .",

    ", the energy expectation is reduced to the complex eigenvalue @xmath21 as will be reviewed below in section  [ sec4 - 1 ] . the momentum flux , on the other hand",
    ", is reduced to @xmath22 again as will be reviewed in section  [ sec4 - 1 ] . taking account of the normalization factor @xmath23 of the resonant wave function",
    ", we see that the relation  ( [ eq2 - 110 ] ) is reduced to @xmath24 which has been obtained previously  @xcite and will be derived in a different context in section  [ sec3 - 2 ] .",
    "the formula  ( [ eq2 - 110 ] ) claims that the imaginary part of the energy expectation indicates a momentum flux going out of the system .",

    "conversely , when we _ assume _ that the hamiltonian of an open system is hermitian from the beginning , the flux must be automatically conserved .",
    "we see indeed in the textbook example of the tunneling phenomenon that the sum of the reflection flux and the transmission flux is equal to the incident flux .",
    "in fact , this physically reasonable phenomenon of the flux conservation is , from an algebraic point of view , a consequence of assuming that the energy variable is real .",
    "now we mention the familiar relation between the imaginary part of an eigenvalue and the decay rate of the resonant state ( see _ e.g. _  ref .",

    "( [ eq2 - 140 ] ) is related to the momentum flux in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 - 110 ] ) as @xmath28 we thus conclude that the imaginary part of the hamiltonian expectation is related to two quantities , the momentum flux going out of the system and the decay rate of the particle number in the system .",
    "this is a very natural conclusion ; the decrease of the particle number in the system is due to the leak from the system ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 - 10 ] ) .",
    "equation  ( [ eq2 - 150 ] ) also indicates that dealing with the complex energy eigenvalue is closely related to dealing with the complex momentum of the eigenstate .",
    "in fact , we have found that in some cases it is more convenient to solve the problem in the complex momentum plane than in the complex energy plane , which we will demonstrate below .",
    "the facts established in the previous section indicate that the open quantum system can possess an eigenstate with a complex eigenvalue .",
    "we generally refer to such a state as a resonant state . in the present section",

    "are known except for a comment on a resonance peak of the transmission probability presented in sections  [ sec3 - 2 ] and  [ sec3 - 3 ] .",
    "readers familiar with the resonant state may skip to section  [ sec3 - 2 ] .",
    "the perhaps new point in the present section is the observation that a resonance peak of the transmission probability does not necessarily correspond to a resonant eigenstate .",
    "we show in a tutorial example , specifically in fig .",
    "4(d ) and  ( e ) , that the lowest peak of the transmission probability , or the conductance , can not be called a resonance peak in the sense that the corresponding resonant eigenstate is missing .",
    "the quantum resonant state is , in most textbooks , defined as a singularity of the @xmath29 matrix .",
    "we show that this definition is actually equivalent to solving the stationary schrdinger equation under a certain boundary condition .",
