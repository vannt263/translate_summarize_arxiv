    "zitterbewegung motion ( zb ) originally refers to the trembling motion of a free relativistic particle ( e.g. , electron ) as described by the dirac equation  @xcite .",
    "zb in this context has an extremely large frequency and a very small amplitude , so it is hardly observable .",
    "nevertheless , the physics of zb becomes highly relevant to a number of interesting situations where the quantum dynamics is governed by artificial dirac or dirac - like equations .",
    "examples include band electrons in graphene @xcite , cavity electrodynamics  @xcite , ultracold atoms in designed laser fields  @xcite , macroscopic sonic crystals and photonic superlattices  @xcite , as well as trapped - ion systems  @xcite . for a review of recent fruitful studies of zb physics using electrons in semiconductors ,",
    "@xcite .    many quantum dynamical phenomena induced by a control field",
    "have been explored using the schrodinger equation .",
    "much less is known in the case of driven dirac or dirac - like equations .",
    "this work is concerned with zb in a simple version of a driven dirac - like equation .",
    "previously , we showed that zb in the cold - atom context as a quantum coherence phenomenon can be coupled with some mechanical oscillations , resulting in the control of the amplitude , the frequency , and the damping of the zb associated with a wavepacket  @xcite .",
    "going one step further , it should be of interest to study what happens to zb if one term in a dirac - like equation is modulated with a frequency on - resonance with the zb frequency .",
    "indeed , in both classical mechanics and quantum mechanics , it is always expected that an oscillation phenomenon can behave remarkably different when it is subject to an on - resonance driving field .",
    "a latest example is bloch oscillation subject to on - resonance driving , where bloch oscillation may be converted to  super - bloch oscillation \"  @xcite or even to directed motion  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we start from a dirac - like equation that is already experimentally realized in the context of trapped - ion systems  @xcite .",
    "we then introduce a modulation to the dirac - like equation , whose frequency is on resonance with the zb frequency . due to the on - resonance driving ,",
    "it is shown , both analytically and numerically , that zb associated with a wavepacket can be converted to directed wavepacket motion . by tailoring the modulation , we may also stop , re - launch or even reverse the directed motion of a wavepacket with negligible distortion .",
    "these results indicate that zb is not a mysterious oscillation , and it provides an extra useful control knob for manipulating quantum motion .",
    "let us consider a simple version of a two - component - spinor dirac - like equation ( taking @xmath0 throughout ) , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the momentum in the @xmath3 direction ; @xmath4 and @xmath5 are two c - number coefficients , @xmath6 are pauli matrices in the @xmath3 and @xmath7 directions .",
    "we first assume @xmath4 is time - independent , with @xmath8 .",
    "time - dependence of @xmath4 will be discussed much later .",
    "we also note that the hamiltonian @xmath9 here depends on @xmath2 , but not on the momentum along the @xmath7 direction .",
    "such kind of hamiltonian may be synthesized by tripod - scheme cold atoms with a strong constraint potential in the transverse direction  @xcite , tripod - scheme cold atoms in a two - dimensional laser setup with mirror oscillations  @xcite , and trapped - ion systems  @xcite .",
    "because the @xmath10 term is the only spin - orbit coupling term , the zb oscillation associated with a wavepacket does not suffer from a fast damping in its oscillation amplitude  @xcite .",
    "we now examine the motion of an initial state ( @xmath11 ) as a product state of a one - dimensional wavepacket in @xmath3 and an internal two - component spinor state , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a broad gaussian in real space centered at @xmath14 ; @xmath15 ( assumed to be zero below ) is the central momentum of the wavepacket along @xmath3 . to better understand zb ,",
    "the dynamics can be analyzed in the momentum space .",
    "hence we carry out the fourier transformation of the wave function to get a narrow wavepacket in momentum representation ( the required narrowness will be explained later ) , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is also a gaussian as the fourier transformation of @xmath13 .    with the initial state specified in eq .",
    "( [ ip ] ) , the internal state will evolve because it effectively experiences two  magnetic fields \" : one along @xmath7 of strength @xmath18 and the other along @xmath3 with strength @xmath19 for the component @xmath2 [ see eq .",
    "the total effective magnetic field strength is @xmath20 and the direction of the total magnetic field is characterized by an angle @xmath21 . to obtain analytical results ,",
    "we keep effects up to the first order of @xmath22 , thus making approximations @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "physically , our approximation is to assume that for different @xmath2 components , their effective zeeman splitting is assumed to be almost the same , but with the internal state precessing around slightly different directions characterized by @xmath21 . in particular , the analytical solution to the dirac - like equation ( [ dirac ] )",
    "can be directly obtained ( for @xmath25 ) , i.e. , @xmath26 here an extra @xmath5-dependent phase factor @xmath27 } $ ] in the second term arises from the @xmath2-dependence of the spinor precession axis .",
    "the meaning of our early assumption of a narrow wavepacket in the momentum space is also clear : the main part of the wavepacket should ensure that @xmath28 . considering effects due to",
    "@xmath29 or high orders will capture some insignificant deformation of the wavepacket and the damping of zb , but as demonstrated by our full numerical results below , these high - order effects will not change the essence of the physics under discussion and can be neglected here .",
    "interestingly , the analytical solution in eq .",
    "( [ evolution ] ) can be interpreted as a superposition of two sub - wavepackets centered at @xmath14 and at @xmath30 .",
    "the occupation probabilities of the two sub - wavepackets are given by @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "as time evolves , these two occupation probabilities oscillate , thus giving rise to a time - dependence of the average position denoted @xmath33 .",
    "the jittering motion is between @xmath34 and @xmath35 , with the angular frequency @xmath18 .",
    "specifically , @xmath36 is given by @xmath37,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is nothing but a zb phenomenon , with the zb frequency @xmath18 , the zb period @xmath38 , and the  equilibrium point \" of the oscillation at @xmath39 .",
    "in particular , when @xmath40 , the sub - wavepacket located at @xmath34 disappears and the other one located at @xmath35 reaches its maximal population .",
    "figure 1(a ) schematically depicts this zb mechanism .",
    "given this interpretation of zb in terms of the population cycling between two sub - wavepackets , we next investigate what if the sign of the @xmath41 term is changed at @xmath42 , with the modified hamiltonian given by @xmath43 at that instant , the state of the system is given by @xmath44 adopting the same approximations as introduced above , we analytically obtain @xmath45g(p_x)\\left(\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\0\\end{array}\\right)e^{-i(\\frac{2d}{c_0})p_x}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] remarkably , eq .  ( [ evolution2 ] ) represents a superposition of a sub - wavepacket located at @xmath35 and a new one at @xmath46 .",
    "the new equilibrium position of zb is hence shifted to @xmath47 . loosely speaking",
    ", this indicates that if a sign change of the @xmath48 term occurs at the right moment , then the @xmath5-dependent extra phase factor [ see eqs . ( 4 ) and ( 8) ] in the time - evolving state makes an opposite contribution and consequently a sub - wavepacket at a new location emerges . from this new solution",
    ", it is also observed that at @xmath49 , the occupation probability of the sub - wavepacket centered at @xmath35 will totally vanish and that of the other centered at @xmath46 will become unity .",
    "the average position of the system moves from @xmath35 at @xmath50 to @xmath46 at @xmath51 .    repeating this strategy , i.e. , abruptly changing the sign of @xmath4 after every interval of @xmath52 , a directed transport emerges from a modulated zb .",
    "that is , if we let @xmath53 where @xmath54 , then zb physics no longer induces oscillations .",
    "instead , zb is forced to become directed motion , as schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "certainly , modulating the @xmath48 term in a slightly different manner may also result in directed transport in the @xmath55 direction .",
    "we will not repeat the similar theoretical analysis .",
    "in addition , as shown below , tailored modulation of @xmath4 can lead to more complicated control over the wavepacket dynamics .",
    "in this section , we verify our analytical results by numerical simulations without any approximation .",
    "two representative modulation schemes are considered . in scheme ( i )",
    ", we introduce the modulation of @xmath4 as described by eq .",
    "( [ modulation1 ] ) first and then stop the modulation for @xmath56 ( @xmath57 integer ) , followed by the same modulation again [ see fig .",
    "2(a ) ] . in scheme ( ii )",
    ", everything is the same except that @xmath58 is an odd integer [ see fig .",
    "2(b ) ] . for scheme ( i ) ,",
    "2(c ) shows that the wavepacket first moves in the @xmath3 direction , then undergoes zb once the modulation is stopped , and finally the directed motion continues after the modulation is switched on again .",
    "the wavepacket profile in real space at different times is plotted in fig .",
    "2(e ) . for scheme ( ii ) ,",
    "2(d ) shows that the wavepacket first moves in the same way as in the first scheme .",
    "however , once the modulation is re - launched , the wavepacket transport is reversed .",
    "so this behavior may be regarded as a type of  super - zb \" oscillations ( analogous to super - bloch oscillations  @xcite ) . as also shown in figs .",
    "2(e ) and 2(f ) , in both schemes the distortion of the wavepacket profile for the shown time scale is invisible to our naked eyes .",
    "the numerical results here confirm our theoretical analysis , demonstrating that zb can be indeed converted to directed wavepacket motion in a well - controlled fashion .    in real experiments",
    ", it should be more straightforward to introduce a smooth modulation to system parameters .",
    "consider then a sinusoidal modulation of @xmath4 , @xmath59 .",
    "this case is somewhat complicated because the magnitude of @xmath4 , and hence the zb frequency , is also time - dependent . to resolve this technical issue",
    ", we define a time - averaged effective zb angular frequency over one half period of modulation , i.e. , @xmath60 in the light of our previous interpretation of zb oscillation , it is expected that after the time interval @xmath61 , one of the two sub - wavepackets has vanished and the other has an occupation probability of unity . in accord with our theoretical insights",
    "above , the sign of @xmath4 must be changing at this moment ( from @xmath62 to @xmath63 or vice versa ) in order to convert zb oscillation to directed motion .",
    "this suggests the following modified resonance condition : @xmath64 .",
    "it should be also noted that for a sinusoidal modulation , the magnitude of @xmath4 can be very small during certain time windows and hence our early treatment in terms of the first - order expansion of @xmath65 can be somewhat problematic .",
    "nevertheless , as seen in fig .  3 , the numerical results confirm that @xmath66 is the required resonance condition under a sinusoidal modulation so that zb oscillation is again converted to directed motion .",
    "this also implies that the controlled dynamics is mainly contributed by the time segments during which @xmath4 is appreciably nonzero . as seen in fig .  3 , for either even or odd @xmath67 ( @xmath68 is now determined by @xmath69 ) , the pattern of the results presented in fig .",
    "3(c)-(f ) is essentially the same as those seen in fig .",
    "2(c)-(f ) , with again little wavepacket distortion .",
    "note also that here the wavepacket transport distance per modulation cycle is less than that achieved by a mere discontinuous sign modulation of @xmath4 .",
    "the dirac - like equation in eq .",
    "( [ dirac ] ) can be realized in cold - atom systems or in trapped - ion systems . according to the concrete experimental realization in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath48 term can be realized through two on - resonance laser fields , with the system parameter @xmath4 connected with the phase and the strength of the laser fields .",
    "modulation of @xmath4 can hence be realized by modulating the laser phase , via a laser phase modulator or even an oscillating mirror  @xcite .",
    "the zb frequency in ref .",
    "@xcite can be several tens of khz , and the required phase modulation frequency should match this zb frequency . again using the experimental parameters in ref .",
    "@xcite , it can be estimated that for a zb frequency of @xmath70 khz , a wavepacket can be transported by about @xmath71 m per modulation cycle .    in summary ,",
    "using a simple dirac - like equation that is already experimentally realized , we show that zb can be converted to directed motion via a periodic driving of the dirac - like equation , if the driving is on resonance with the zb oscillation .",
    "we hope that our results can motivate further studies of quantum control in driven dirac - like equations .",
