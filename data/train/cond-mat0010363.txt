    "a growing interest in non - extensive thermodynamics can be traced back to the 1988 pioneering work of tsallis @xcite . in particular ,",
    "non - extensive thermodynamics is the proper theoretical context for developing the foundations of non - canonical distribution functions and non - canonical equilibria in physical systems . on the basis of the subsequent development of the original work by tsallis",
    ", it has been argued that canonical equilibria , the distributions that form the basis of equilibrium statistical mechanics , are not generic .",
    "rather , canonical equilibria are singular in a more general form of equilibrium , called a generalized canonical equilibrium @xcite .",
    "a number of recent papers elaborate on this idea @xcite , but we find @xcite to be of special interest addressing as it does the foundations of both canonical and non - canonical equilibria .",
    "rajagopal and abe @xcite prove that the equilibrium described by the canonical distribution is not uniquely determined by the micro - canonical distribution , as one finds in text books .",
    "in fact if the phase space has a fractal , rather than smooth , structure , a non - canonical distribution will result .",
    "however , although canonical equilibria are not unique , and non - canonical equilibria are possible , one might conclude on the basis of the arguments in @xcite that the form of the non - canonical distribution is uniquely of the form established by tsallis and his co - workers @xcite .",
    "as attractive as the probabilistic and entropic arguments of ref .",
    "@xcite are , they are not indisputable , and in fact we find herein , using dynamical arguments , that this is not the case .    we show that the adoption of a dynamical approach to thermodynamical equilibrium yields a different conclusion .",
    "first of all , we argue that the non - extensive condition based on memory , and probably that resting on long - range correlations as well , has the striking effect of making the role of dynamics much more important than in the case of ordinary statistics . the dynamic approach , in these non - extensive conditions , generates a form on non - canonical equilibrium that , however , departs from the generalized canonical form prescribed by non - extensive thermodynamics . to make it easier for the reader to follow our arguments and to understand the purpose of the paper , illustrated in section [ purpose ] , we shall first discuss the different natures of the entropic , dynamic and stochastic approaches to equilibrium .",
    "the argument for the non - extensive thermodynamics of tsallis goes as follows .",
    "first of all , the conventional entropy of gibbs @xmath0 is replaced by the non - extensive entropic indicator @xmath1 secondly , we have to apply a method of entropy maximization under given physical constraints to determine the most plausible shape of the unknown probability density function @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the first constraint is on the normalization of the distribution @xmath2 : @xmath3 the second constraint is on the first moment of the variable @xmath4 itself .",
    "according to the most recent prescription of ref.@xcite the constraints on @xmath4 must be applied@xcite on the mean value @xmath5 defined by @xmath6 it has to be pointed out that in ref.@xcite the physical meaning of @xmath4 is that of energy . here",
    ", we shall interpret @xmath4 as the `` coordinate '' of an overdamped particle driven by a fluctuation - dissipation process resulting from the interaction with a non - conventional `` thermal bath '' .",
    "when the friction term can be neglected we are expected to recover the results of the earlier work of ref.@xcite .",
    "thus , for the same reasons @xcite as those illustrated in ref.@xcite we set a constraint on the first moment of @xmath7 .",
    "the result of entropy maximization subject to the imposed constraints of eq .",
    "( [ firstmoment ] ) yields @xmath8^{1/(1-q)}/z_{q } ,      \\label{generalizedcanonical}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is a normalization factor and @xmath10 is a constant value stemming from the lagrange multiplier associated with the constraint on the variable @xmath4 . note that the expression of @xmath2 provided by the authors of ref.@xcite is not explicit .",
    "in fact , as shown by eq.([generalizedcanonical ] ) , it is a functional of @xmath2 .",
    "thus , in practice the explicit form of @xmath2 has to be established by means of an iteration procedure .",
    "it is remarkable , however , that the micro - canonical derivation from ref.@xcite results in the same prescription as that of eq.([generalizedcanonical ] ) .",
    "from the point of view of the issues under discussion here what matters is the fact that at the end of the iterative procedure @xmath5 becomes a well - defined number .",
    "consequently , the resulting expression for @xmath2 is a simple analytical formula that in the asymptotic limit , @xmath11 , with the constraint on the first moment of @xmath7 , has the same structure as that derived in ref.@xcite , @xmath12^{1/(q-1)}}}.      \\label{pi2}\\ ] ] note that the adoption of a constraint on the second moment would lead to @xmath13 }      \\frac{\\gamma(1/(q-1 ) ) } { \\gamma((3-q)/[2(q-1 ) ] ) } }      { [ 1+\\tilde{b}(q-1 ) x^{2}]^{1/(q-1)}}.      \\label{new}\\ ] ] note that both eq.([pi2 ] ) and eq.([new ] ) are the result of an earlier prescription , missing the normalization factor present in eq.([firstmoment ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , it has to be pointed out that both eq.([pi2 ] ) and eq.([generalizedcanonical ] ) share the characteristic of having long tails with lvy statistics .",
    "in fact , it is well known @xcite that the anomalous diffusion processes of the lvy kind , in the one - dimensional case , are characterized by probability distributions @xmath14 whose fourier transform in the symmetric case reads @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the lvy index ranging , in principle , in the interval @xmath17 , and @xmath18 denotes the diffusion intensity .",
    "the inverse fourier transform of @xmath19 of eq.([pk ] ) is characterized by the tail @xcite @xmath20 which would lead immediately to the anomalous entropy index @xmath21    ( 210,180)(0,0 ) = 6truecm = 8.5truecm ( -10,0 )    we have to stress , however , that except for the case @xmath22 , corresponding to the ballistic limit , the central part of the distribution produced by the lvy process of eq.([pk ] ) can not be expressed in an analytical form and can significantly depart from the analytical form of both eqs.([pi2 ] ) and ( [ generalizedcanonical ] ) .",
    "the adoption of the prescription of eq.([new ] ) is expected to yield better agreement , but , as we shall see subsequently , it does not seem to be compatible with the nature of the dynamical approach to equilibrium . in fig.[confrontolevytsallis ] we compare the lvy distribution to both the prediction of eq.([pi2 ] ) and eq.([new ] ) and find that there exists a significant disagreement between tsallis and lvy statistics , even though some authors@xcite refer to them as equivalent . in this paper",
    "we focus our attention on the origin of the difference between the two kinds of statistics .",
    "our dynamic approach leads to a form of equilibrium that is stable , in the sense of the lvy - gnedenko theorem @xcite , while the generalized canonical equilibrium of eq.([generalizedcanonical ] ) is not .",
    "this is evident in the free case , due to the difference between the tsallis and the lvy structure . in section [ theo ]",
    "we prove that this is so also in the presence of a feedback with the system of interest of the generator of fluctuations .",
    "we are convinced that there are no incontrovertible reasons why the canonical distribution should be the unique form of thermodynamic equilibrium , and on this issue we essentially agree with the point of view of rajagopal and abe@xcite .",
    "however , we are equally convinced that the generalized canonical form of eq.([generalizedcanonical ] ) does not satisfy the stable conditions necessary for lvy statistics , and the results of the present paper can be thought of as providing plausible evidence of that .",
    "to substantiate this view with dynamical arguments , it is convenient to concisely review the results of an earlier work@xcite .",
    "the ambitious purpose of this earlier work was that of reversing the path from thermodynamics to mechanics established by boltzmann .",
    "the main idea behind ref.@xcite is as follows .",
    "the fokker - planck equation is a well - known description of the evolution of the probability density in phase space .",
    "many attempts have been made in the literature to derive this equation@xcite .",
    "however , all these attempts rest on the assumption that the bath , responsible for the brownian behavior of the particle of interest , is given by a set of harmonic oscillators .",
    "this means that a statistical assumption must be made on the initial condition of the bath , which is arbitrarily given a canonical equilibrium distribution , corresponding to a given temperature @xmath23 of the thermal bath .",
    "consequently , this kind of approach to brownian motion is only partially dynamical , since significant use is already made of statistical mechanics , and thus of thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite adopted a totally different approach .",
    "they assumed that a given oscillator , playing the role of a stochastic brownian particle , interacts with another hamiltonian system , which should play the role of a bath .",
    "they called this second system a _ booster _ , to stress that the ensuing approach has to rest only on the dynamical properties of this kind of bath , with no use whatsoever of thermodynamical arguments . after establishing the dynamical conditions ensuring the validity of the fokker - planck equation",
    ", it is found that the oscillator of interest reaches a canonical equilibrium distribution . due to the nature of the procedure",
    "adopted the width of this canonical distribution depends only on the parameters of the hamiltonian system under study .",
    "consequently , it is possible to derive a mechanical expression for temperature .",
    "this is the key result of ref.@xcite , which reads @xmath24\\ } \\right]^{-1}.      \\label{bianucci}\\ ] ] note that @xmath25 denotes the _ doorway _ variable , namely the variable of the booster through which the interaction between the booster and the oscillator of interest is established .",
    "the symbol @xmath26 denotes the laplace transform of the correlation function of @xmath25 evaluated at the oscillation frequency of the oscillator .",
    "the structure of this expression reflects the application of linear response theory@xcite .",
    "the correlation function whose laplace transform is in eq .",
    "( [ bianucci ] ) is evaluated assuming the booster to be in a micro - canonical equilibrium with energy @xmath27 and this condition is not affected by the interaction with the oscillator .",
    "the symbol @xmath28 denotes the number of states of the booster in the same physical condition , and , consequently , obeys the ordinary prescription @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the number of degrees of freedom in the booster .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite note that for @xmath31 , @xmath32\\ }      < < \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial e } ln a(e ) .",
    "\\label{crucialinequality}\\ ] ] this means that in the limiting case of infinitely many degrees of freedom the predictions of boltzmann are recovered : @xmath33 .",
    "note that the condition of eq.([crucialinequality ] ) holds true if the doorway variable @xmath25 depends on a number of particles which is kept fixed with @xmath31 .",
    "in other words , the condition of eq.([crucialinequality ] ) , or equivalently , boltzmann s principle , rests on an interaction condition , which is crucial for the extensive statistical mechanics perspective to apply .",
    "let us see this aspect in detail .",
    "in ref.@xcite the booster is the the well known fermi - pasta - ulam ( fpu ) system@xcite .",
    "this is a chain of particles interacting with one another via nonlinear interactions .",
    "let us consider two opposite conditions .",
    "in the former , which is the one adopted in ref.@xcite , the oscillator of interest interacts only with the first particle of the fpu chain . in the latter",
    "the oscillator of interest interacts with all the particles of the fpu chain , with interaction strength of comparable intensities .",
    "the former condition refers to a short - range interaction , confined to the positions of the oscillator of interest and to the first particle of the fpu chain . in the latter condition",
    ", the interaction extends over the whole fpu chain .",
    "it is evident that the former condition fits the inequality of eq.([crucialinequality ] ) , whereas the latter does not .",
    "this means that the latter condition results in a non - extensive form of dynamics , with a consequent breakdown of the prescriptions of ordinary statistical mechanics .",
    "the former condition , on the contrary , for @xmath31 , recovers ordinary statistical mechanics .",
    "this suggests that the dynamical corrections to the boltzmann principle , recorded in ref.@xcite for relatively small values of @xmath30 , are a manifestation of incipient non - extensive statistical mechanics , and so are very close to the breakdown of the fokker - planck treatment on which the analysis ref.@xcite rests . note",
    "that when we assign to the oscillator of interest a very low frequency , compared to the booster frequencies , the quantity @xmath34 $ ] turns out to virtually coincide with the time scale @xmath35 of the variable @xmath25 , defined by @xmath36 herein we focus our attention on the case where @xmath37 with @xmath38 the inverse power law form of the correlation function means that we select time memory as the source of violation of extensivity , rather than long - range spatial interactions .",
    "the parameter @xmath35 denotes the correlation time of the fluctuating variable @xmath25 .",
    "here we consider the dichotomous case , where the variable @xmath25 has two distinct values , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , with fluctuating time durations .",
    "the correlation function @xmath41 is proven @xcite to be proportional to the second time derivative of the distribution of waiting times in the two states of the variable @xmath25 .",
    "this function , as we shall see in section [ stocdyn ] , depends on another time , @xmath42 , as well as on @xmath10 .    in conclusion",
    ", the work of ref.@xcite establishes the dynamical conditions necessary to derive canonical equilibrium .",
    "the authors prove that canonical equilibrium implies an interaction with a booster with a finite time scale and a short - range interaction .",
    "we can also observe that in this case the use of dynamical arguments yields the same conclusions as the very simple argument based on the law of large numbers .",
    "the advocates of the law of large numbers for the foundation of statistical mechanics@xcite might judge the dynamical perspective to be of limited use . we prefer to interpret the conclusion of ref.@xcite as proof that in the extensive case the canonical distribution description of thermodynamic equilibrium is unique .",
    "the numerical work of ref.@xcite shows that it is very difficult to detect the dynamical corrections to the boltzmann principle illustrated by eq.([bianucci ] ) from within an extensive perspective .",
    "this is so because the dynamical corrections become significant when the booster is small , and , as clearly pointed out by the recent work of gross@xcite , a small system is essentially non - extensive .",
    "thus , the numerical findings of ref.@xcite refer to a condition very close to the breakdown of the extensive condition and consequently of the canonical equilibrium on which eq.([bianucci ] ) rests .",
    "this means that the dynamical approach can be of great utility . in the case of non - extensive statistical mechanics ,",
    "the dynamic approach is probably the only non - ambiguous way to address the subtle issues posed by the entropic and probabilistic methods .      in this section",
    "we explain the nature of our dynamical approach to the non - canonical equilibrium distribution .",
    "this approach rests on a stochastic method adapted to the need of realizing a dichotomous variable @xmath25 with the two possible values , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and with the waiting time distribution @xmath43 where @xmath10 ranges in the interval of eq.([crucialpowerinterval ] ) .",
    "note that the parameter @xmath42 is of crucial importance to define the time scale of our process and corresponds to the mean residence time in either of the two states of the velocity variable @xmath25 . in accordance with the prescriptions of ref.@xcite",
    "this waiting - time distribution yields the kind of correlation function @xmath41 that we plan to study herein ( see eq.([timebreakdownofextensivity ] ) ) .",
    "in fact , as shown in ref.@xcite , the form of eq.([waitingtimedistribution ] ) yields the correlation function @xmath44 fitting the asymptotic time limit of eq.([timebreakdownofextensivity ] ) . this condition can be considered as the natural one - dimensional counterpart of the two - dimensional billiards of zaslavsky @xcite . from this point of view , our commitment to the adoption of a merely dynamical approach is not broken , since the stochastic approach that will be adopted in sections [ dynamical ] and [ theo ] is statistically equivalent to the adoption of the intermittent map of ref.@xcite , on which the theoretical work of ref.@xcite is based .",
    "we stress that the equivalence between a dynamical map and a stochastic process is the reason why contact can be established between the dynamical and the entropic approaches .",
    "in fact , as shown in ref.@xcite the non - extensive tsallis entropic indicator serves the purpose of guessing the most convenient form for the transition probability @xmath2 , which is then related to the waiting - time distribution @xmath45 through the basic property @xmath46 the factor of @xmath47 takes into account that the probability of making the jump @xmath4 is equal to that of making the jump @xmath48 , namely , the jump in the opposite direction .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite show that the left - hand term of this equality , eq.([pipsi ] ) , can be predicted using entropic arguments , while the right - hand term of the same equation is dictated by dynamical arguments based on the intermittent map of ref.@xcite .",
    "these dynamical arguments are supplemented by the assumption of random injection of the trajectory from the chaotic into the laminar region of the intermittent map , an argument leading to an analytical prediction for @xmath45 in complete agreement with the numerical observation of dynamics@xcite .",
    "the earlier work of ref.@xcite established that the adoption of the method of entropy maximization applied to the non - extensive entropy of eq.([nonextensiveentropy ] ) results in a form of @xmath2 which is compatible with the birth of lvy statistics .",
    "however , the @xmath2 thus derived is not the equilibrium distribution of the variable @xmath4 .",
    "rather it is the probability for the random walker to make a jump of length @xmath7 .",
    "this is a stationary property determined by the special kind of booster here under study .",
    "the ensuing diffusion process yields a lvy form as a result of the lvy - gnedenko theorem @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ confrontolevytsallis ] , the shape of this distribution departs from the form of the generalized canonical distribution of eq.([generalizedcanonical ] ) , even if we adopt the constraint on the second moment , in spite of the fact that it does not fit the nature of the dynamical approach here illustrated .    to account for this discrepancy",
    "we might make the conjecture that the comparison between the lvy statistics and the tsallis generalized canonical distribution is not appropriate .",
    "the former refers to a diffusion process , and the latter to an allegedly equilibrium condition .",
    "actually , after exploring this possibility we shall conclude that the latter , at least in the case of the dynamic model of the present paper , can not reflect an equilibrium property .",
    "however , at the present stage , we are forced to develop a picture comparable to that of the earlier work of ref.@xcite .",
    "we have to study a case where the variable @xmath4 not only undergoes the influence of the diffusion producing fluctuations , but it produces a feedback on its own `` bath '' , balancing the diffusion process , so as to create an equilibrium condition .",
    "this is the condition to compare to the generalized canonical distribution of eq.([generalizedcanonical ] ) . in other words , to address , from a dynamical perspective , the issues recently dealt with by rajagopal and abe@xcite we can not disregard the feedback from the system to the `` bath . ''      at this stage it is much easier for us to illustrate the main purpose of the present paper .",
    "we want to explore a condition where the booster does not fulfill the key condition of eq.([finitetime ] ) , that is , the microscopic relaxation time diverges , and we want to assess whether or not this divergence leads to the generalized canonical distribution of eq.([generalizedcanonical ] ) .",
    "we aim at answering the question : which is the form of the equilibrium distribution reached by the system of interest when the time scale of the _ booster _ is infinite ?    to answer this question",
    "we do not adopt , as done in ref .",
    "@xcite , a hamiltonian approach .",
    "the latter approach is difficult for obvious reasons .",
    "a numerical simulation check of the theoretical prediction would imply technical difficulties caused by the slowness of the booster itself .",
    "this means that the anomalous booster is replaced , as done in earlier papers@xcite , by a generator of a dichotomous fluctuation with an inverse power law distribution of waiting times .",
    "the essential ingredient of the approach of ref.@xcite , not yet present in the dynamical derivation of a free lvy diffusion , is a feedback of the diffusing variable on the generator of the fluctuations .",
    "this aspect has already been considered in the earlier work of ref.@xcite . however , in that paper the dynamical approach to the feedback was replaced by a phenomenological friction , which did not allow the authors of that paper to keep the promise of resting solely on dynamical arguments at any level . in conclusion , we adopt the program of ref.@xcite , based on the observation of the fluctuation - dissipation process caused by the interaction of a particle with a booster having no finite time scale .",
    "the presence of feedback serves the purpose of balancing the diffusion process with dissipation so as to result eventually in an equilibrium condition .    with the program of ref.@xcite in mind",
    ", we have to refer ourselves to the correlation function , eq.([completeform ] ) , with the index @xmath10 fulfilling the condition of eq.([crucialpowerinterval ] ) , and so implying the breakdown of the time scale separation between the macroscopic and the microscopic levels .",
    "the realization of the program of statistical mechanics requires an accurate definition of the process of memory erasure associated with the transition from one to the other velocity state@xcite .",
    "this is more conveniently defined by the waiting - time distribution @xmath45 of eq.([waitingtimedistribution ] ) , than by the correlation function of eq.([completeform ] ) .",
    "we see that even if the condition of eq.([crucialpowerinterval ] ) applies , the time @xmath49 remains finite .",
    "memory of microscopic dynamics is lost in times @xmath50 .    at this stage",
    "it is convenient to support our claim concerning memory erasure with arguments borrowed from the earlier investigation of gaspard and wang@xcite .",
    "these authors studied the kolmogorov complexity of the manneville map and found that in the regime corresponding to the dynamical foundation of lvy processes the kolmogorov complexity is a linear function of time .",
    "this means that at a given time @xmath51 the number of transitions @xmath52 from the one to the other laminar region is given by @xmath53 .",
    "this means that for @xmath54 the conditions for the realization of the generalized version of the central limit theorem are fulfilled , since the function defined by @xmath55 where the asterix denotes a convolution , and for @xmath56 , eq .",
    "( [ generic ] ) tends to the lvy distribution .",
    "one might be tempted to make the conjecture that in the presence of feedback the number @xmath52 can not increase beyond some limit , and that equilibrium is reached with a relatively low value of @xmath52 so as to allow the distribution to maintain the structure of a generalized canonical distribution _",
    " la _ tsallis .",
    "in this paper we limit our analysis to the case where the linear response theory of section [ theo ] holds true .",
    "this forces us to adopt a feedback so weak that this possibility does not emerge from our simulations .",
    "the dynamical model studied here depends on a process of free diffusion with feedback , established through control of a dynamical parameter of the booster .",
    "this feedback process has the role of balancing diffusion so as to realize dynamically the equilibrium condition .",
    "we illustrate first the dynamical model used as the generator of free diffusion , then we show how the feedback is realized , and finally we illustrate the numerical technique adopted .",
    "formally free diffusion is realized using the equation of motion @xmath57 here the dynamical variable @xmath58 denotes either a spatial coordinate or a velocity . in the former case",
    "the variable @xmath59 has to be considered a fluctuating velocity , while in the latter case it is regarded as a fluctuating acceleration .",
    "the results are equivalent , and the reader can adopt either of them , even if we consider @xmath58 to be a spatial coordinate so as to make the connection with earlier work @xcite more natural .",
    "we assume the variable @xmath59 to be dichotomous , namely , we shall assign to this variable only two distinct values , either @xmath39 or @xmath40 .",
    "the motivation for this choice is not only simplicity , but also has to do with the main purpose of this paper , that of assessing the specific form the non - canonical equilibrium . also , of course , and prior to this purpose , that of proving that deviations from canonical equilibrium can be generated as a consequence of the breakdown of the ordinary condition of time - scale separation between macroscopic and microscopic processes . in the limiting case where the variable @xmath59 is gaussian , and",
    "consequently produces a gaussian equilibrium distribution @xcite , the resulting diffusion process is gaussian and the final equilibrium distribution can turn out to be gaussian as well @xcite , as a result of having established a seed of ordinary statistics at the microscopic level .",
    "for this reason the choice of microscopic statistics , departing from the ordinary statistical condition is crucial , and the adoption of the dichotomous assumption serves the purpose of eventually establishing a non - canonical equilibrium .",
    "the variable @xmath59 keeps one of the two possible values for times with a random duration .",
    "thus , a statistical treatment must be adopted and a waiting - time distribution @xmath45 is used .",
    "the time intervals of sojourn in a given state are labelled by an integer index @xmath60 running from @xmath61 to @xmath62 . at the end of any sojourn",
    "the variable can either change its value , and thus make a transition from @xmath39 to @xmath40 or from @xmath40 to @xmath39 , or it can keep its original value . the probability of changing values and that of keeping the same value are equal , and thus equal to @xmath47 .",
    "we can interpret the variable @xmath59 as a function of the continuous time @xmath51 by adopting the following prescription : @xmath63 where the times @xmath64 and @xmath65 denote the beginning and the ending time of the @xmath66 sojourn , respectively , and the values @xmath67 are randomly assigned either the value @xmath39 or the value @xmath40 with equal probability and @xmath68 if @xmath69 . the sequel of the times @xmath70",
    "is fixed by the waiting time density distribution @xmath71 , by selecting a given value @xmath72 , of the interval @xmath73 $ ] , with @xmath74 with the probability @xmath75 .",
    "the waiting time distribution @xmath71 is assigned an inverse power law form determined by the constraint of yielding the correlation function @xmath76 where @xmath10 is a positive number determining the integrability of the correlation function . if @xmath77 the correlation function , eq.([correlationfunction ] ) , is integrable and the microscopic time scale @xmath78 can be defined . according to refs.@xcite the form of @xmath45",
    "is determined by that of @xmath41 through the relation @xmath79 which yields @xmath80 we note that the parameter @xmath42 appearing in both eq.([correlationfunction ] ) and eq.([explicit ] ) is the mean sojourn time .",
    "thus , in some sense , when the microscopic time of eq.([microscopictime ] ) becomes infinite , the role of the microscopic time scale is played by @xmath42 .    by integration of eq.([fundamentalequation ] ) we get @xmath81 where @xmath51 is a time located in the interval @xmath82 $ ] with @xmath83 , in accordance with the earlier prescriptions .",
    "furthermore , the transition probability of section [ non - ext ] is obviously related to the waiting time distribution by eq.([pipsi ] ) .",
    "note that , as discussed in detail in refs.@xcite , there are two distinct basins of attraction for the diffusion process resulting from the repeated occurrence of the transition process of eq.([pipsi ] ) , the gauss basin for @xmath84 and the lvy basin for @xmath85 .",
    "to control diffusion in such a way so as to generate a known equilibrium distribution we adopt a model based on replacing eq.([fundamentalequation ] ) with @xmath86 which means that the motion of the fluctuating variable @xmath87 also depends on the value of the dynamic variable @xmath4 .",
    "we make the simplifying assumption that the _ relaxation time _ , or response time , of the booster , @xmath88 , is shorter than that of the particle of interest , @xmath89 , so as to ensure for the booster a _ time dependent equilibrium condition _ determined by the state of the system of interest . in other words ,",
    "the booster is assumed to be in a condition of equilibrium determined by the variable @xmath4 . as the variable @xmath4 moves from an initial condition @xmath90 out of equilibrium state , i.e. from a position larger than that fluctuations of @xmath4 itself , to the final equilibrium , the booster correspondingly moves from an equilibrium to another equilibrium condition .",
    "all this is illustrated by the following mathematical arguments .",
    "these arguments do not aim at providing a rigorous mathematical treatment , but rather a heuristic treatment reflecting the physical condition that we are assigning to the booster .    to make the analysis in terms of a strictly stochastic process",
    ", we build up the following regularized process @xmath91 , defined by : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is a regularization time and in the last equivalence it has been explicited the spatial dependence of the noise on @xmath94 .",
    "this new process @xmath94 has the characteristics of @xmath58 in the mean , but its fluctuations are smoothed by using the temporal mean .",
    "if the response time @xmath95 of the bath is fast and if @xmath93 is long enough , but always smaller than relaxation time @xmath96 of the variable @xmath4 , one can suppose that the phase space mean is almost equivalent to the temporal mean : @xmath97 now , assuming linear response is valid , the mean value of the thermal bath variable depends on @xmath94 as : @xmath98 with the linear response hypothesis inserted into eq .",
    "( [ mediatemporale&spaziale ] ) the equation for the regularized process @xmath99 is obtained .",
    "the solution @xmath100 shows a relaxation toward the equilibrium @xmath101 , on a time scale @xmath102 .    the analogy with a stochastic equation , such as the ornstein - uhlenbeck or its extension to lvy noise @xcite , is completed by adding a fictitious stochastic noise @xmath103 in ( [ smorzamento ] ) , that summarizes the fluctuations on the time scale @xmath93 and that compensates for the approximation inserted into eq .",
    "( [ mediatemporale&spaziale ] ) : @xmath104 hence , with the assumptions of linear response theory and relaxation times of the thermal bath faster than of that of the variable of interest ( partial equilibrium ) , a diffusive process becomes an equilibrium process .",
