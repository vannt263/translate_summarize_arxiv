    "newly born neutron stars are hot and lepton rich objects , quite different from ordinary low temperature , lepton poor neutron stars . in view of these differences ,",
    "newly born neutron stars are called _ protoneutron _ stars ; they transform into standard neutron stars on a timescale of the order of ten seconds , needed for the loss of a significant lepton number excess via emission of neutrinos trapped in dense , hot interior .    in view of the fact that the typical evolution timescale of a protoneutron star ( seconds ) is some three orders of magnitude longer , than the dynamical timescale for this objects ( milliseconds )",
    ", one can study its evolution in the quasistatic approximation ( burrows & lattimer 1986 ) .",
    "static properties of protoneutron stars , under various assumptions concerning composition and equation of state ( eos ) of hot , dense stellar interior were studied by numerous authors ( burrows & lattimer 1986 , takatsuka 1995 , bombaci et al .",
    "1995 , bombaci 1996 , prakash et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the scenario of transformation of a protoneutron star into a neutron star could be strongly influenced by a phase transition in the central region of the star .",
    "brown and bethe ( 1994 ) suggested a phase transition implied by the @xmath0 condensation at supranuclear densities .",
    "such a @xmath0 condensation could dramatically soften the equation of state of dense matter , leading to a low maximum allowable mass of neutron stars .",
    "in such a case , the massive protoneutron stars could be stabilized by the effects of high temperature and of the presence of trapped neutrinos , and this would lead to maximum baryon mass of protoneutron stars larger by some @xmath1 than that of cold neutron stars .",
    "the deleptonization and cooling of protoneutron stars of baryon mass exceeding the maximum allowable baryon mass for neutron stars , would then inevitably lead to their collapse into black holes .",
    "the dynamics of such a process was recently studied by baumgarte et al .",
    "it should be mentioned , however , that the very possibility of existence of the kaon condensate ( or other exotic phases of matter , such as the pion condensate , or the quark matter ) at neutron star densities is far from being established .",
    "recently , for instance , pandharipande et al . (",
    "1995 ) pointed out , that kaon - nucleon and nucleon - nucleon correlations in dense matter raise significantly the threshold density for kaon condensation . in view of these uncertainties",
    ", we will restrict in the present paper to a standard model of dense matter , composed of nucleons and leptons .",
    "the calculations of the static models of protoneutron stars should be considered as a first step in the studies of these objects .",
    "it is clear , in view of the dynamical scenario of their formation , that protoneutron stars are far from being static .",
    "the formation scenario involves compression ( with overshoot of central density ) and a hydrodynamical bounce , so that a newborn protoneutron star begins its life in a highly excited state , pulsating around its quasistatic equilibrium .",
    "if the rotation of protoneutron star is not too rapid , the coupling of radial and non - radial pulsations is weak .",
    "such a scenario of formation leads to a preferential excitation of the radial modes .",
    "having constructed the static model of a protoneutron star , one should thus answer the question about the stability of the static configuration with respect to radial perturbations ( standard stability criteria are valid only for cold neutron stars ) . clearly , both high temperature and large trapped lepton number will influence the spectrum of radial eigenfrequencies of protoneutron stars , implying differences with respect to the case of cold neutron stars .    in the present paper",
    "we study the radial pulsations of protoneutron stars and their stability .",
    "our models of protoneutron stars are composed of a hot , neutrino - opaque interior ( hereafter referred to as `` hot interior '' ) , separated from much colder , neutrino - transparent envelope by a neutrinosphere .",
    "we will consider two limiting cases of the thermal state of the hot interior : isentropic , with entropy per baryon @xmath2 , and isothermal , with @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the value of the temperature , measured by an observer at infinity , while @xmath5 is the value of the temperature measured by a local observer ) .",
    "the first case , characteristic of a very initial state of a protoneutron star , will simultaneously correspond to a significant trapped lepton number .",
    "the second case corresponds to situation after the deleptonization of a protoneutron star .",
    "the position of the neutrinosphere will be located using a simple prescription based on specific properties of the neutrino opacity of hot dense matter . in all cases , the equation of state of hot dense matter",
    "will be determined using one of the realistic models of lattimer and swesty ( 1991 ) .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the physical state of the interior of protoneutron star , with particular emphasis on the eos of the hot interior at various stages of evolution of a protoneutron star .",
    "we explain also our prescription for locating the neutrinosphere of a protoneutron star , and we give some details concerning the assumed temperature profile within protoneutron star .",
    "equations of state , corresponding to different physical situations , are described in section 3 .",
    "we also present there static models of protoneutron stars , calculated for various assumptions concerning the hot stellar interior . in section 4",
    "we compare various timescales , characteristic of evolution and dynamics of a protoneutron star , which are essential for approximations used in the treatment of pulsations .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the formulation of the problem of linear , adiabatic , radial pulsations of protoneutron stars .",
    "both pulsations and stability involve the adiabatic index of pulsating stellar interior ; our results for this important quantity are presented in section 6 .",
    "numerical results for the eigenfrequencies of the lowest modes of radial pulsations and the problem of stability of protoneutron stars are presented in section 7 .",
    "finally , section 8 contains a discussion of our results and conclusion .",
    "we will consider a protoneutron star ( pns ) just after its formation .",
    "we will assume it has a well defined neutrinosphere , which separates a hot , neutrino - opaque interior from colder , neutrino - transparent outer envelope .",
    "the parameters , which determine the local state of the matter in the hot interior are : baryon ( nucleon ) number density @xmath6 , net electron fraction @xmath7 , and the net electron - neutrino fraction @xmath8 .",
    "the calculation of the composition of hot matter and of its eos is described below .",
    "the situation described in this subsection is characteristic of the very initial stage of existence of a pns .",
    "matter is assumed to be composed of nucleons ( both free and bound in nuclei ) and leptons ( electrons and neutrinos ; for the sake of simplicity , we do not include muons ) .",
    "all constituents of the matter ( plus photons ) are in thermodynamic equilibrium at given values of @xmath6 , @xmath5 and @xmath9 .",
    "the composition of the matter is calculated from the condition of beta equilibrium , combined with the condition of a fixed @xmath10 , @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the chemical potentials of matter constituents . at the very initial stage",
    "we expect @xmath13 .",
    "electron neutrinos are degenerate , with @xmath14 ( in what follows we measure @xmath5 in energy units ) .",
    "the deleptonization , implying the decrease of @xmath10 , occurs due to diffusion of neutrinos outward ( driven by the @xmath15 gradient ) , on a timescale of seconds ( sawyer & soni 1979 , bombaci et al .",
    "the diffusion of highly degenerate neutrinos from the central core is a dissipative process , resulting in a significant _ heating _ of the neutrino - opaque core ( burrows & lattimer 1986 ) .",
    "this is the limiting case , reached after complete deleptonization .",
    "there is no trapped lepton number , so that @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and therefore @xmath19 .",
    "neutrinos trapped within the hot interior do not therefore influence the beta equilibrium of nucleons , electrons and positrons , and for given @xmath6 and @xmath5 the equilibrium value of @xmath20 is determined from @xmath21 while @xmath22 . in practice , this approximation can be used as soon as electron neutrinos become non - degenerate within the opaque core , @xmath23 , which occurs after some @xmath24 seconds ( sawyer & soni 1979 , prakash et al .",
    "1997 ) .      in principle ,",
    "the temperature ( or entropy per nucleon ) profile within a pns has to be determined via evolutionary calculation , starting from some initial state , and taking into account relevant transport processes in the pns interior , as well as neutrino emission from pns .",
    "transport processes within neutrino - opaque interior occur on timescales of seconds , some three orders of magnitude longer than dynamical timescales .",
    "convection can shorten neutrino transport timescale , but still the time needed for the deleptonization of the neutrino opaque core is then much longer than the dynamical timescale .",
    "the very outer layer of a pns becomes rapidly transparent to neutrinos , deleptonizes , and cools on a very short timescale via @xmath25 pair annihilation and plasmon decay to @xmath26 mev .",
    "it seemed thus natural to model the thermal structure of the pns interior by a hot core limited by a neutrinosphere , and a much cooler , neutrino transparent outer envelope .",
    "the transition through the neutrinosphere is accompanied by a temperature drop , which takes place over some interval of density just above the `` edge '' of the hot neutrino - opaque core , situated at some @xmath27 .    in view of the uncertainties in the actual temperature profiles within the hot interior of pns , we considered two extremal situations for @xmath28 , corresponding to an isentropic and an isothermal hot interior . in the first case ,",
    "hot interior was characterized by a constant entropy per baryon @xmath2 . in the case of trapped lepton number",

    "this eos will be denoted by eos[@xmath34 .",
    "the condition of isothermality , which in the static case corresponds to a vanishing heat flux , is more complicated . due to the curvature of the space - time within pns",
    ", the condition of isothermality ( thermal equilibration ) corresponds to the constancy of @xmath35 ( see , e.g. , zeldovich & novikov 1971 , chapter 10.6 ) .",
    "actually , the isothermal state within the hot interior will be reached on a timescale corresponding to thermal equilibration , which is much longer than the lifetime of a pns . nevertheless , we considered the @xmath36 models because , as a limiting case so different from the @xmath2 one , it enables us to check the dependence of our results for pns on the thermal state of the hot interior .",
    "to determine the isothermal temperature profile in the hot interior after deleptonization , we use the condition of thermal equilibrium , given by the constancy of the function @xmath37 ( where @xmath38 is the metric fuction , see sect . 5 ) .",
    "the relativistic condition of the isothermality can be rewritten as : @xmath39 this formula enables us to determine the @xmath40 profile , for given eos , _ independently _ of the specific structure of the stellar model under consideration .",
    "treating @xmath6 , @xmath5 as thermodynamic variables for our equation of state , we can rewrite eq .",

    "thus in our relativistic calculations the set of the `` isothermal '' stellar configurations corresponds to stars with given @xmath42 .",
    "starting from @xmath43 , the temperature increases inward , reaching its maximum value in the center of the star where @xmath44 .",
    "this central temperature is the function of the central density @xmath45 and is larger for a star with larger @xmath45 .",
    "our calculation of the neutrinosphere within the hot pns interior is explained below . for a given static pns model ,",
    "the neutrinosphere radius , @xmath46 , has been located through the condition @xmath47 where @xmath48 is calculated at the matter temperature , @xmath49 is the mean energy of non - degenerate neutrinos at and above the neutrinosphere , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 is the proper distance from the star center .",
    "we assumed that neutrino opacity above @xmath46 is dominated by the elastic scattering off nuclei and nucleons , so that @xmath52",
    ". then , we determined the value of the density at the neutrinosphere , @xmath27 , for a given static pns model , combining eq .",

    "the proper distance near the neutrinosphere is given by @xmath58 .",
    "using the definition of the neutrinosphere radius , @xmath46 , we can express the mass of the envelope above @xmath46 and the pressure at @xmath46 , denoted by @xmath59 , in terms of @xmath60 .",

    "the temperature profile was adjusted in such a way , that neutrinosphere was found within the region of the temperature drop . for a @xmath65 pns , and an isothermal hot core with @xmath66mev , we found @xmath67mev , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 . in the case of a very massive pns with @xmath70 we obtained ( for the same value of @xmath42 ) @xmath71mev , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",

    "a notable exception from this behavior is that of the fundamental mode near the maximum mass of pns , for which results obtained using @xmath159 are very close to those obtained using @xmath156 .",

    "11 we can see an interesting phenomenon  abrupt , nearly stepwise changes in frequencies of the consecutive ( neighbouring ) oscillation modes , especially pronounced for cold neutron stars , but clearly visible also in the case of @xmath83  mev , @xmath189 models of pns .",
    "this is the `` avoided crossing '' phenomenon of the _ radial _ modes of neutron stars .",
    "this effect is known from the analysis of the _ nonradial _ oscillations in `` ordinary '' stars ( aizenman , smeyers and weigert ( 1977 ) , christensen  dalsgaard ( 1980 ) ) and has been recently considered by lee and strohmayer ( 1996 ) for _ nonradial _ oscillations of rotating neutron stars .",
    "our preliminary studies of this effect indicate , that the stepwise changes of @xmath190 are due to the change of the character of the standing - wave solution for the eigenproblem .",
    "namely , at the \" avoided crossing point the solution changes from the standing wave localized mainly in the outer layer of the star , to that localized predominantly in the central core .",
    "this topic will be discussed in separate paper ( gondek et al .",
    "the birth of protoneutron stars is a dynamical process , and a newborn protoneutron star is expected to pulsate .",
    "these pulsations were excited during star formation . in the present paper we studied linear , radial pulsations of protoneutron stars , under various assumptions concerning hot stellar core , and for a large interval of stellar masses .",
    "the spectrum of the lowest modes of radial pulsations of protoneutron stars is quite different from that of cold neutron stars .",
    "generally , protoneutron stars are significantly softer with respect to the radial pulsations , than cold neutron stars , and this difference increases for higher modes and for lower stellar masses .",
    "these differences stem from different structure of protoneutron stars , which in contrast to cold neutron stars have extended envelopes , inflated by thermal and trapped neutrinos effects .",
    "the standard static criteria of stability of neutron star models were derived under the assumption of cold , catalyzed matter ( harrison et al .",
    "we have shown , that to a rather good approximation , the configuration with maximum mass separates stable configurations from the secularly unstable ones ( with respect to fundamental mode of small radial pulsations ) . therefore , despite thermal and neutrino trapping effects , one can apply standard `` maximum mass '' criterion to locate the relativistic instability of protoneutron stars , both for the isentropic and the isothermal hot , neutrino opaque cores .",
    "the role of thermal effects increases with decreasing stellar mass .",
    "static `` minimum mass '' criterion does apply with a rather good precision to protoneutron stars with hot isentropic , neutrino opaque cores .",
    "this is due to the fact , that the perturbation itself conserves entropy ( pulsations are adiabatic ) , and equilibration of matter is sufficiently fast .",
    "however , the `` minimum mass '' criterion does not apply to protoneutron stars with hot isothermal cores .",
    "in both cases , the minimum masses of protoneutron stars are rather large ( for our models of dense hot matter we obtained the values of @xmath191 and @xmath192 for the isentropic ( @xmath173 , @xmath76 ) and the isothermal ( @xmath193 ) models , respectively .    our treatment of the thermal state of the protoneutron star interior should be considered as very crude .",
    "the temperature profile might be affected by convection . also , our method of locating the neutrinosphere was very approximate .",
    "clearly , the treatment of thermal effects can be refined , but we do not think this will significantly change our main results .",
    "our calculations were performed for only one model of the nucleon component of dense hot matter .",
    "the model was realistic , and enabled us to treat in a unified way the whole interior ( core as well as the envelope ) of the protoneutron star .",
    "however , in view of the uncertainties in the eos of dense matter at supranuclear densities , one should of course study the whole range of theoretical possibilities , for a broad set - from soft to stiff - of supranuclear , high temperature eos .",
    "an example of such an investigation in the case of the _ static _ protoneutron stars , is the study of prakash et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .    in a hypothetical scenario , proposed by brown and bethe ( 1994 )",
    ", a protoneutron star borns as a hot , lepton rich object , composed of nucleons and leptons .",
    "if the final state of cold neutron star is characterized by a large electron fraction , due to the appearance of a large amplitude @xmath0 - condensate ( or because a large fraction of baryons are negatively charged hyperons ) , then the cold equation of state of neutron star matter is softer than that of hot , lepton rich protoneutron star . in such a case , @xmath194 , and",
    "all protoneutron stars with baryon mass exceeding @xmath195 will eventually collapse into black holes .",
    "clearly , in such a case the problem of stability of the protoneutron star models in the vicinity of @xmath196 with respect to radial pulsations looses its significance .",
