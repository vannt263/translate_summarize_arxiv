    "the high - proper motion star nltt  16249 is a double degenerate system showing hydrogen lines and molecular carbon and cyanogen bands in its optical spectrum @xcite .",
    "although large radial velocity variations were noted by @xcite , the orbital parameters , period and separation , are yet to be determined .",
    "the detection of photospheric nitrogen in the carbon - rich ( dq ) component of this system was a first occurrence for this class of objects and , according to the dredge - up scenario commonly applied to dq white dwarfs @xcite , it implied the presence of nitrogen in the white dwarf core .",
    "the other component is a hydrogen - rich ( da ) white dwarf with a mass above average but with a luminosity similar to that of the dq white dwarf .",
    "the two characteristics of the system , a nitrogen - enriched dq component and a likely close orbit , may or may not be related .",
    "@xcite established a clear evolutionary link between born - again stars and a nitrogen / oxygen enrichment in pg1159 stars and their dq descendents .",
    "members of the pg1159 class have a helium - rich surface with notable enrichment in carbon , nitrogen and oxygen @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that not all dq stars followed the born - again path because the carbon abundance is lower in some of these objects than would be expected following this evolutionary path .",
    "however , the @xmath4 versus  trend established by @xcite and @xcite does appear to follow the model predictions of @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite noted two discernible tracks with one at a higher carbon abundance that was attributed to a thinning of the helium layer .",
    "therefore , data and born - again models may be compatible for the bulk of dq white dwarfs . however , nitrogen is not detected in any dq stars other than in the dq in nltt  16249 .    in this letter , we present convincing evidence that the components of the binary nltt  16249 are in a close orbit . our new radial velocity measurements",
    "( section 2 ) and our original model atmosphere analysis @xcite help constrain the component properties and offer clues to the origin and evolutionary prospect of the system ( section 3 ) .",
    "we summarize and discuss these new results in section 4 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      +      the cooling age of the da white dwarf is estimated at @xmath5 gyr .",
    "a high mass for both white dwarfs implies relatively massive , @xmath6 ( see a discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , hence short - lived progenitors ( @xmath7 gyr , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , constraining the total age of the system to less than 3 gyr .    using our measured period ( 1.17 d ) and mass ratio @xmath8 , and constraining the da mass to @xmath9 , the merger time",
    "is estimated at @xmath10  yr following @xcite .",
    "therefore , the system is not a candidate type 1a supernova progenitor .",
    "the systemic velocity was obtained by subtracting the calculated gravitational redshift ( @xmath11 ) from the mean velocity of the da white dwarf ( @xmath12 ) , @xmath13 . adopting a distance of @xmath14 pc , the systemic velocity and proper - motion measurements ( @xmath15 mas yr@xmath16 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) correspond to the galactic velocity components @xmath17  following @xcite .",
    "the system belongs to the thin - disk population @xcite in agreement with its young age ( @xmath18 gyr ) .",
    "we have shown that the peculiar dq white dwarf in nltt  16249 is in a close 1.17 d orbit with a da white dwarf companion . close",
    "double - degenerate stars are common and @xcite reported a fraction of 5 to 19% of close pairs in their radial velocity survey .",
    "white dwarfs with composite spectra indicative of da plus db ( hei ) or da plus dc ( cool he - rich ) pairs are also relatively common in large surveys ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , only two da+dq pairs are known : nltt  16249 and sdss  j153210.04 + 135615.0 ( nltt  40489 ) which was recently identified by @xcite .",
    "the velocity amplitudes in nltt  16249 imply that the dq is slightly more massive than its companion in which case it is more likely that the dq formed first , both from @xmath19 progenitors , unless stable mass transfer reversed the initial mass ratio ( for detailed scenarios see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the relatively long orbital period reported here rules out the prospect of a merger within a hubble time .",
    "the dq white dwarf is peculiar and the nitrogen concentration in its atmosphere is , so far , unique .",
    "@xcite followed the evolution of a 2.7@xmath1 main - sequence star past the pg1159 spectroscopic stage and down the cooling track up to the dq stage ( 0.6@xmath1 ) .",
    "the star follows a `` born - again '' he - flash loop that resets its evolution onto the post - asymptotic giant - branch ( post - agb ) , considerably modifying the chemical structure of the outer layers that an otherwise normal post - agb would possess . in particular , @xcite predicted measurable concentrations of nitrogen and oxygen in the atmosphere of dq descendents of born - again stars .",
    "the nitrogen abundance measured in the dq component of nltt  16249 is qualitatively similar to the abundance predicted for the 10,500  k model , the lowest temperature considered by @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath20 ratio for that particular model is close to 300 , i.e , much larger than measured in nltt  16249 ( @xmath21 ) . in the born - again context",
    ", the difference could be attributed to a different progenitor mass which could affect the outcome of the chemical evolution , although such models are not available to us .",
    "@xcite also predicted a concentration of oxygen between that of carbon and nitrogen ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "it is possible to constrain the @xmath23 abundance ratio in dq white dwarfs using the near and far ultraviolet co  fourth - positive \" ( 4p ) bands along with cn violet and c@xmath3 swan bands . finally , the @xmath24 isotopic ratio expected for the same evolutionary track is well below detection limits reported by @xcite in the case of the dq in nltt  16249",
    ".    what would be the role , if any , played by binary interactions in shaping the chemical structure of the dq progenitor in nltt  16249 ?",
    "the dq white dwarfs are not known to show nitrogen in their spectra ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . therefore , it may not be a coincidence that the only known detection of nitrogen in a dq white dwarf is also that of a white dwarf in a close double - degenerate system . in that context",
    "as well , it remains to be shown that detectable traces of nitrogen would be the expected outcome of mass - transfer or early envelope ejection .",
