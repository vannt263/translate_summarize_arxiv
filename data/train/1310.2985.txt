    "the standard model ( sm ) of electro - weak interactions does not provide a viable candidate for dark matter ( dm )  @xcite . to unravel the dm mystery we need to consider its extensions . among many existing proposals",
    "there is the simplest dm model , constructed by adding a real singlet scalar field to the sm particles .",
    "we would like to propose a variation of the singlet scalar extension consisting of an adition of the @xmath0 extra scalar singlets transforming according to the fundamental representation of @xmath1 symmetry group .    in this paper",
    "we confront our model with theoretical bounds ( unitarity , stability , triviality ) and cosmological data ( the amount of dm in the universe @xcite and direct detection xenon 100 experiment @xcite ) .",
    "we also note , that conventional collisionless cold dark matter has problems explaining the observed structure of galaxies and significant self - interaction rate provides possible cure ( see section [ sec : sidm ] and @xcite ) .",
    "we shall consider the sm extended by addition of @xmath0 scalars @xmath2 which are singlets under the sm gauge group @xmath3 .",
    "we assume that the @xmath0-component vector @xmath4 transforms according to the fundamental representation of @xmath1 - an exact symmetry of the model .",
    "all sm fields are singlets under @xmath1 . for the purpose of providing a dm candidate",
    "we impose an additional @xmath5 symmetry , under which @xmath4 is odd : @xmath6 .",
    "the most general , symmetric and renormalizable potential is : @xmath7 the higgs field is a sm doublet with a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , @xmath8 for @xmath9 gev . after the symmetry breaking the higgs - boson mass",
    "is @xmath10 , as in the sm .",
    "the singlet s masses also get a vev contribution , @xmath11 .",
    "singlets do not develop a vev - we would like them to be stable , so the @xmath5 must be unbroken with @xmath12 .",
    "that implies @xmath13 which is a significant constraint - light scalars ( @xmath14 ) must couple very weakly to the sm .",
    "quartic couplings are constrained by the unitarity arguments for longitudinal w boson- and scalar - scattering @xcite , @xcite : @xmath15    tree level vacuum stability of the scalar potential ( [ pot ] ) implies that either all the quartic couplings are positive : @xmath16 or @xmath17 is negative and @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "we require that the during the renormalization group equation ( rge ) running , the quartic couplings @xmath19 remain finite up to the cut - off scale @xmath20 .",
    "that implies limits on the model parameters , in particular an upper limit on @xmath21 ( so called triviality bound ) .",
    "the rge for running couplings in our model can be found in @xcite .",
    "we solve those equations with initial conditions : @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we assume that for a given @xmath20 there is no pole in the evolution of the scalar quartic couplings at energies below @xmath20 .",
    "that gives us constraints in the @xmath25 plane depending on initial parameters @xmath26 and @xmath0 - see the left panel of fig.[triv_n ] .",
    "note that the allowed region shrinks as @xmath27 grows and the upper bound on @xmath28 is getting lower .",
    "there is also an asymmetry between the negative and positive branch of @xmath29 initial conditions , see the right panel of fig.[triv_n ]",
    "stability of the singlets @xmath4 makes them good dm candidates . to calculate dm relic abundance in a case of compound dm we need in general a set of boltzmann equations for all component .",
    "because of the @xmath1 symmetry it actually simplifies to one equation @xcite : @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the number density of dm , @xmath33 is the equilibrium distribution , @xmath34 - number of relativistic degrees of freedom , @xmath35 - planck mass , @xmath36 - the thermally averaged cross section for @xmath37 processes @xcite , @xcite .",
    "total abundance of dm , @xmath38 , reads @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the dark matter relic density from @xmath41-th scalar field @xmath2 .",
    "we solve ( [ b_eq ] ) in the standard cdm case @xcite using micromegas  @xcite . from the wmap data",
    "@xcite we know that @xmath42 ( allowing for @xmath43 uncertainty ) and for a given choice of @xmath0 , @xmath28 and @xmath44 we seek @xmath17 such that this constraint is satisfied , see fig .",
    "[ phases ] .",
    "note that in the vicinity of resonance , the annihilation cross section is enhanced ( @xmath45 ) , therefore @xmath17 is suppressed to reach the desired dm abundance .      in the cdm model",
    "we achieve equilibrium between certain particles and the sm species just to lose it ( freeze - out ) while the universe cools .",
    "what happens if the dm particles interact with sm so feebly ( @xmath46 ) , that equilibrium with the sm species is never achieved @xcite ?    in the following we will assume the number density @xmath47 was negligible at the big bang : @xmath48 . having @xmath47 determined by the boltzmann equation ( [ b_eq ] ) ( see fig .",
    "[ boltzman ] , left panel ) one can get the dm relic abundance : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the present photon temperature , @xmath51 is the critical density . for solutions satisfying ( [ om - fidm ] ) see fig .",
    "[ boltzman ] , right panel .      the direct detection rate of @xmath4 is determined by the cross section of @xmath4 scattering off nuclei ( see the feynman diagram in fig .",
    "[ directxenon ] ) , which can be found e.g. in @xcite for @xmath52 and in @xcite for compound dm case . in fig .",
    "[ directxenon ] we show allowed regions in the @xmath53 plane that remain after imposing limits on the elastic scattering of dm particles off nucleons from xenon100 ( the strongest limits on @xmath54 in the mass range of our interest , @xcite ) .",
    "the white band corresponds to the resonance region seen in fig .",
    "[ phases ] for @xmath45 in which the annihilation is amplified and the coupling @xmath17 is suppressed . since the xenon100 data start at @xmath55 gev therefore the vertical strip of masses below 5 gev is also allowed .",
    "the standard @xmath20cdm model is facing some difficulties if compared with observations .",
    "high - resolution n - body simulations have shown that the model generates cusps of the dm density distribution in central regions of galaxies  @xcite and the number of subhalos predicted by the model turns out to be larger than the observed  @xcite number .",
    "self - interacting dm ( sidm ) was proposed by spergel & steinhardt  @xcite to cure those problems .",
    "the key feature of sidm is that the mean free path of dm particles should be between 1 kpc and 1 mpc in regions where the dark matter density is about @xmath56 . in terms of the unit mass cross section",
    "the steinhardt & spergel hypothesis requires that : @xmath57 for different @xmath0 this condition implies a relation between @xmath58 and @xmath44 illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ss ] as an allowed region in the ( @xmath59 ) space . in the plots",
    "@xmath60 varies form 0 up to its maximal value allowed by unitarity , i.e. @xmath61 .",
    "similar results were obtained in other versions of scalar dm models @xcite , @xcite . as observed from fig .",
    "[ phases ] , @xmath44 consistent with the spergel and steinhardt condition is so small that it is not compatible with the cdm case .",
    "the only viable option is the fidm , therefore @xmath62 ( only the first panel in fig .",
    "[ ss ] is consistent with the dm abundance ) . in this case , from fig .",
    "[ boltzman ] one can see that @xmath63 gev corresponds to @xmath64 for @xmath65 .",
    "we have considered an extension of the standard model by an addition of @xmath0 real scalar singlets @xmath66 with @xmath1 symmetry that are candidates for dark matter .",
    "we have discussed theoretical and experimental ( cosmological ) constraints on the model parameters .",
    "the xenon100 direct dm detection experiment gives no constraints on the model in the fidm case ( too small coupling of dm to the sm ) , but constrain strongly the cdm solution ( see fig .",
    "[ directxenon ] ) .",
    "we have shown that steinhardt & spergel solution of the dm density distribution problem within the singlet scalar sm extension requires feebly interacting dm .",
