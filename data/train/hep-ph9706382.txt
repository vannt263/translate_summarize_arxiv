    "the search for supersymmetric particles is now an integral part of all current , as well as future , experimental programs at high - energy colliders . aside from many attractive features of supersymmetry ( susy )",
    "@xcite , the driving force for these searches comes from the recognition that weak - scale susy , which is introduced to solve the gauge hierarchy problem , requires that the susy partners of the standard model ( sm ) particles must be accessible to experiments that probe the tev energy scale .",
    "if this is the case , a large number of gluinos and squarks will be produced at future hadron colliders such as the cern lhc ( operated at @xmath21 tev with luminosity @xmath22 @xmath23s@xmath24 ) and very large hadron collider ( vlhc ; operated at @xmath25200 tev with @xmath22@xmath26 @xmath23s@xmath24 ) .",
    "once produced , gluinos and squarks will subsequently decay to the lightest neutralino ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "this means that such hadron colliders will become the `` neutralino factory '' , which is capable of producing up to @xmath1 @xmath3 s per year .",
    "the @xmath3 is usually assumed to be the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) and thus stable if @xmath6-parity is conserved .",
    "it will then escape the detector , resulting in the famous missing energy signature for susy @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath3 might not be altogether stable : if there exists another superparticle lighter than @xmath3 , such as the gravitino ( @xmath4 ) or axino ( @xmath5 ) , the @xmath3 will decay into , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath27 @xcite or @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "such a light gravitino naturally exists in gauge - mediated susy breaking ( gmsb ) models [ 512 ] as well as in a class of no - scale supergravity ( sugra ) models @xcite .",
    "a light axino can also exist in sugra models with the peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry @xcite . as another possibility",
    ", the violation of @xmath6-parity leads to the unstable @xmath3 even if it is the lsp .",
    "the @xmath3 will then decay into such modes as @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath3 decay takes place inside the detector , the resultant event topology would be very different from that in case of the stable @xmath3 .",
    "the experimental signatures have recently been studied for the @xmath3 decay into @xmath27 [ 1625 ] and @xmath28 @xcite , motivated by the single @xmath32 event observed in the cdf experiment at the tevatron @xcite . for the cdf event interpreted as the signal of the @xmath3 decay ,",
    "the inferred decay length @xmath7 is much below 1 m. however , subsequent reports on diphoton @xmath33 distribution observed in the cdf @xcite and d@xmath34 @xcite experiments , as well as the analysis of the lep data at @xmath35 gev @xcite , do not give any further evidence for the @xmath3 decay into photon(s ) with such short @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , the possibility is still open for the @xmath3 decay into @xmath27 or @xmath28 occurring mostly outside the detector .",
    "actually , such a slow decay of @xmath3 appears to be favored at least for relatively light @xmath3 : original gmsb models @xcite prefer relatively high susy breaking scale , @xmath36 gev @xcite , implying @xmath37 km for @xmath38 gev . in case of the @xmath18 decay",
    ", the allowed range of the pq symmetry breaking scale , @xmath1 gev@xmath39 gev @xcite , leads to @xmath40 km for @xmath38 gev .",
    "if the @xmath3 decay is slow and mostly occurs outside the detector , the signature observed in usual collider experiments will be indistinguishable from that of the stable @xmath3 . hence the signal of the @xmath3 decay",
    "would be missed entirely . even if a significant part of @xmath3 s produced at hadron colliders decay into photon(s ) inside the detector , it might be hard to detect the signature with usual detectors , because a huge number of particles produced will make it difficult to identify a single photon not coming from the interaction point .",
    "in addition , the detectors for the approved experiments at the lhc are not designed to measure the direction of each photon precisely .",
    "therefore , in order to search for a slow decay of @xmath3 , we propose a dedicated experiment with the interaction point surrounded by a thick shield , by which most of the collision products are dumped .",
    "the @xmath3 would go through the shield and decay in a long decay tunnel .",
    "the decay product of @xmath3 can then be detected by a detector located at the end of the tunnel .",
    "we show that the slow arrival time and the large off angle ( to the direction of the interaction point ) of the decay product will provide an unambiguous signal of slowly decaying @xmath3 s .",
    "we also show that , in case of the @xmath3 decay into a photon and a light invisible particle such as @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the mass of @xmath3 can be determined by using the correlation between the energy and the arrival time of the decay photon .",
    "furthermore , by reconstructing the decay kinematics with the estimated decay position , one can determine whether the final state is two - body or not .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first show in section  [ sec : lhc ] how the lhc can be the neutralino factory . in section  [ sec :",
    "model ] , we briefly review the theoretical models of the @xmath3 decay into a gravitino or an axino .",
    "our strategy of the search for a slow decay of @xmath3 is then described in section  [ sec : scheme ] . in section  [ sec : mass ] , we illustrate the method of determining the mass of @xmath3 after the discovery of its decay .",
    "section  [ sec : vlhc ] is devoted to the discussion of the @xmath3 decay search at vlhc .",
    "we also discuss in section  [ sec : other ] other searches which are possible with our setup , _",
    "i.e. _ , ( i )  other decay modes of @xmath3 , ( ii )  slow decays of any other longlived neutral or charged particles , and ( iii )  heavy stable charged particles . finally , we present our conclusions in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "a realistic design for the detector is investigated with monte carlo simulations in appendix  [ sec : dete ] . in appendix",
    "[ sec : munu ] , we estimate the rates of high - energy prompt neutrinos and muons , which can go through the iron shield and thus become the potential background .",
    "to simulate the @xmath3 production and decay at the lhc , we first generate various susy processes in @xmath41 collisions at @xmath21 tev using isajet 7.13 @xcite with the cteq2l parton distribution functions @xcite . in most cases ,",
    "the dominant products are the gluino ( @xmath42 ) and squark ( @xmath43 ) , which will then decay into @xmath3 s through @xmath44 and @xmath45 if @xmath46 , and @xmath47 and @xmath48 if @xmath49 .",
    "if the gluino and squark are heavy ( @xmath50 tev ) , the production of gauginos ( charginos and neutralinos ) could become dominant . as an example",
    ", we take @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and assume the gaugino mass unification , which is known to roughly hold not only in sugra models but also in most of gmsb models .",
    "figure  [ fig : cross ] shows the total cross sections for the production of gluinos , squarks and gauginos , as well as the anticipated numbers of events per 100 fb@xmath24 , at the lhc as a function of @xmath54 .",
    "we note that each susy event contains two @xmath3 s in the final state . also shown in this figure",
    "are the corresponding values of @xmath55 , which results from the gaugino mass unification .",
    "it is worth noting that the cross sections increase by a factor up to @xmath56 when the next - to - leading order qcd corrections are properly included @xcite .",
    "for the discussion below , we select three representative gluino and neutralino masses : @xmath57 gev and @xmath58 gev ( case  1 ) ; @xmath59 gev and @xmath60 gev ( case",
    "2 ) ; and @xmath61 gev and @xmath62 gev ( case  3 ) .    figure  [ fig : angle ] shows the angular distributions of @xmath3 s produced at the lhc for ( a )  case  1 , ( b )  case  2 , and ( c )  case  3 .",
    "the integrated luminosity is taken to be 100 fb@xmath24 , which corresponds to the runtime of @xmath63 s with @xmath22 @xmath23s@xmath24 .",
    "the total numbers of produced @xmath3 s are @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 for case  1 , 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "it can be seen that most of @xmath3 s are produced in the forward direction .",
    "more events can thus be detected if one installs a detector at a smaller angle @xmath67 with respect to the colliding proton beam .",
    "we here choose @xmath68 ( or @xmath69 ) for the central axis of the detector by compromising the rate of the signal and that of the potential background ( high - energy prompt neutrinos and muons ) as discussed in appendix  [ sec : munu ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : eneut ] shows the energy spectra of produced @xmath3 s pointing to the detector which covers @xmath70 and an elevation angle of @xmath71 .",
    "we find that , in all three cases , the majority of @xmath3 s are produced with relatively low energies , _",
    "i.e. _ , the energy spectra have a peak at @xmath72 to 2 .",
    "this means that most of the produced @xmath3 s are not extremely relativistic , having @xmath73 .",
    "this makes the time measurement of the decay products a powerful tool for the identification of slowly decaying @xmath3 s .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is widely acknowledged to be the best motivated extension of the sm .",
    "this is not only because it provides a natural solution to the gauge hierarchy problem , but also there exist many pieces of indirect evidence , such as the correct prediction of @xmath74 , the convergence of the sm gauge couplings at very high energies , and the heaviness of the top quark as required by the radiative breaking of the electroweak gauge symmetry .",
    "moreover , susy can provide a plausible candidate for cosmological dark matter .",
    "these hints , as a whole , appear to constitute circumstantial evidence for susy .",
    "susy , however , must be broken because no susy partners of ordinary particles have been discovered .",
    "the breaking of susy is usually conceived to occur in a hidden sector at some very high energies , which will probably remain unaccessible to direct collider experiments at least in the near future .",
    "thus the investigation into the origin of the susy breaking is of great importance since it could be the unique window to look into the world of such high energies , perhaps up to the planck scale .",
    "two scenarios have been proposed on how the susy breaking is communicated from the hidden sector to the observable sector : in one scenario , as in supergravity ( sugra ) models @xcite , susy breaking is mediated by gravity . in this case , the susy breaking scale @xmath16 is necessarily of order @xmath75 gev to give the superparticle masses around the weak scale . the other is the gauge - mediated susy breaking ( gmsb ) scenario [ 512 ] , where susy is broken at a scale as low as @xmath76@xmath63 gev , and the gauge interactions act as the messengers of susy breaking . because of this relatively low value of @xmath16 , the mass degeneracy among squarks or sleptons , which results from the fact that gauge interactions are flavor blind , is hardly broken by the evolution to the weak scale , in contrast to sugra models .",
    "this ensures sufficient suppression of flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes .",
    "in addition , gmsb models may also provide a solution to the susy @xmath77 problem @xcite .",
    "these two scenarios also lead to distinctive consequences concerning cosmological dark matter . in sugra models ,",
    "the lightest neutralino ( @xmath3 ) is usually the lsp , and can be the dominant component of dark matter . on the other hand",
    ", gmsb models naturally predict that the gravitino ( @xmath4 ) comes out to be the lsp .",
    "the gravitino with mass @xmath78 kev is claimed to be a good candidate for warm dark matter @xcite .",
    "we note that it is practically impossible to directly detect the gravitino dark matter in laboratories , in contrast to the neutralino dark matter , whose direct detection is being pursued in many experiments .    in this way , for finding the future direction of particle physics and cosmology , it is of crucial importance to determine which scenario is realized in nature .",
    "as will be shown later , our experiment to search for a slow decay of @xmath3 can probe a wide range of @xmath7 , which corresponds to @xmath16 of order @xmath76 to @xmath79 gev in case of the @xmath13 decay .",
    "this covers much of the @xmath16 range presently considered in gmsb models .",
    "the gravitino mass @xmath80 is related to @xmath16 ( on the condition of the vanishing cosmological constant ) by @xmath81 where @xmath82 gev is the reduced planck mass .",
    "this leads to @xmath83 and 24 kev for @xmath84 and @xmath63 gev , respectively .",
    "note that the gravitino heavier than @xmath2 kev overcloses the universe in the standard cosmology .",
    "such a heavy gravitino , however , is still allowed to be the dark matter if the reheating temperature after the inflation is low enough @xcite .    the longitudinal component of the gravitino , _",
    "i.e. _ , the goldstino , couples to matter with weak ( not gravitational ) interaction strength proportional to @xmath85 . through this coupling",
    ", the @xmath3 will decay to a photon and a gravitino with a partial width of @xcite @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the square of the photino admixture of the @xmath3 . if the @xmath3 is a pure bino , @xmath88 .",
    "this partial width is most likely to be the dominant one if the @xmath3 is the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) with not too small @xmath87 , resulting in the decay length @xmath89 for @xmath90 gev and @xmath91 gev , this decay length is much longer than a typical detector size , leading that most of the decays will occur outside the detector .",
    "it has recently been pointed out @xcite that such large @xmath16 ( @xmath92 gev ) is expected in original gmsb models @xcite .",
    "in addition , other gmsb models [ 911 ] tend to predict that susy breaking occurs at relatively high ( @xmath93 gev ) energies , although @xmath94@xmath0 gev can naturally fit in with a very recent model @xcite . equation  ( [ eq : ctau_g ] ) also indicates that the measurement of both @xmath14 and @xmath7 will give direct information on @xmath16 .",
    "the peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry was introduced to solve the strong @xmath77 problem @xcite .",
    "this symmetry should be explicitly broken , leading to a light pseudoscalar , the axion ( @xmath95 ) , whose mass is related to the pq symmetry breaking scale @xmath19 by @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the qcd anomaly factor of the pq symmetry .",
    "the axion is one of good candidates for dark matter owing to its feeble interaction with matter .",
    "the allowed range of @xmath19 is confined to @xmath1@xmath98 gev @xcite from laboratory experiments as well as from astrophysical and cosmological considerations .",
    "if both the pq symmetry and susy hold in nature , there should exist the fermionic superpartner of the axion , the axino ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the axino can remain light even after the susy breaking in sugra models @xcite .",
    "in particular , the axino with mass @xmath99 kev could serve as warm dark matter @xcite as is the case for the gravitino .",
    "if such a light axino exists , the @xmath3 can decay into @xmath28 . in case of the @xmath3 being a pure bino ,",
    "the decay width can be written as @xcite @xmath100 which corresponds to the decay length @xmath101 the lower limit on the pq symmetry breaking scale , @xmath102 gev , implies @xmath40 km for @xmath38 gev .",
    "we propose a completely new type of collider experiment , which is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] . gluinos and squarks ( and possibly gauginos ) are produced in @xmath41 collisions at the interaction point and promptly decay into @xmath3 s .",
    "the @xmath3 s then enter the decay tunnel after going through the shield , by which most of the collision products are dumped . as a simple example",
    ", we here consider an iron shield of 10 m thickness , and take the tunnel length to be @xmath103 m , although a much longer tunnel is certainly possible .",
    "the acceptance of the tunnel is taken to be @xmath70 and an elevation angle of @xmath71 .",
    "we choose this angle @xmath67 by compromising the rate of the signal and that of the potential background ( see appendix  [ sec : munu ] ) .",
    "two layers of the anti - coincidence hodoscopes possibly with track detectors are installed just on the back end of the shield for the rejection of punchthrough muons .",
    "it can also be used for the trigger of heavy longlived charged particles . in addition",
    ", the scintillation counters and/or track detectors can be installed on the wall around the decay tunnel to reject potential background events produced by cosmic rays . if the @xmath3 decays to a photon and a light invisible particle in the tunnel , the decay photon will reach the end of the tunnel and enter a shower detector which has a spherical front face , and initiate the electromagnetic shower . the incident position , angle , and energy of the photon , as well as the arrival time relative to the rf clock of the accelerator ,",
    "are measured by the detector .    instead of the bulk iron shield , we can use ( at extra costs ) an `` active '' @xmath104-shield , consisting of segmented calorimeters , magnetized iron plates and the muon trackers .",
    "this setup will enable us to measure the total ( and missing ) transverse energy of the event and to tag the existence of high - energy muons .",
    "the decay probability of @xmath3 within a distance of @xmath105 is given by @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the lorentz factor , and @xmath7 is the decay length . as a typical case",
    ", the probability that the @xmath3 with @xmath108 decays in the tunnel ( 10 m @xmath109 51.6 m ) is calculated to be 20% for @xmath110 m , and 2.4% for @xmath111 m.    in the following monte carlo simulations , we assume that the decay photon is emitted isotropically with energy equal to @xmath112 in the rest frame of the @xmath3 , as is the case for the @xmath13 decay with @xmath113 . the photon 4-momentum ( @xmath114 , @xmath115 ) in the laboratory frame is then calculated by the lorentz boost .",

    "<S> prospects are examined for the detection of a slow decay of the lightest neutralino ( or any other longlived particles ) at the cern lhc and at very large hadron collider ( vlhc ) . </S>",

    "<S> the lightest neutralino ( @xmath3 ) , usually assumed to be stable , will be unstable if lighter superparticles such as the gravitino ( @xmath4 ) or axino ( @xmath5 ) exist , or @xmath6-parity is not conserved . </S>",
    "<S> the decay signal would , however , be missed in usual collider experiments , particularly when the decay mostly occurs outside the detector . in order to search for such a slow decay of @xmath3 , </S>",
    "<S> we propose a dedicated experiment where the collision products are dumped by a thick shield , which is followed by a long decay tunnel . </S>",
    "<S> the decay product of @xmath3 can be detected by a detector located at the end of the tunnel . </S>",
    "<S> the slow arrival time and the large off angle ( to the direction of the interaction point ) of the decay product will provide a clear signature of slowly decaying @xmath3 s . </S>",
    "<S> one can explore the decay length ( @xmath7 ) in a wide range , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , 0.2 m to @xmath8 km for @xmath9 gev and 1 m to 2 km for @xmath10 gev at the lhc . </S>",

    "<S> the mass of the decaying particle can be determined by using the correlation between the energy and the arrival time of the decay product . with the setup we propose </S>",
    "<S> , one can also search for ( i )  other decay modes of @xmath3 such as @xmath6-parity violating one , ( ii )  slow decays of any other longlived neutral or charged particles , and ( iii )  heavy stable charged particles .    ` </S>",
