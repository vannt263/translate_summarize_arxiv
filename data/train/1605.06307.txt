    "the two dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in the presence of magnetic field has been of special interest to the condensed matter physicists since the discovery of the quantum hall effect @xcite and the fractional quantum hall effect @xcite .",
    "the 2deg in a periodic potential and magnetic field has been the cradle of several interesting and important theoretical concepts like the identification of a topological invariant with the hall conductivity @xcite and the existence of a fractal structure in the energy gaps , the hofstadter butterfly @xcite .",
    "interest in this phenomenon has been recently revived with the experimental observation of the hofstadter butterfly in graphene superlattices @xcite and the realization of the hofstadter hamiltonian in the optical lattice systems @xcite .",
    "this has motivated us to study the effect of interactions on the hofstadter butterfly .",
    "the hofstadter butterfly emerges from the interplay of two length scales in the lattice systems : the periodicity of the lattice and the magnetic length @xcite .",
    "it is an effect that emerges when we look at the single particle energy gaps and hall conductivities of a large number of physical systems , in principle , an infinite number of systems with flux per plaquette , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 are co - prime integers and @xmath2 . for non - interacting systems with fermion densities corresponding to filled bands , the gaps exhibit a self similar structure .",
    "further , if the hall conductivities , in units of @xmath3 are plotted as a function of @xmath4 and the number of fermions per unit cell , the contours with the same hall conductivities are straight lines with integer intercepts .",
    "the hall conductivity of each contour and the intercept are solutions of a diophantine equation .",
    "this plot , the landau fan diagram , is the experimental evidence of the hofstadter butterfly in graphene superlattices @xcite .    interaction can induce charge ordering that can break the translational symmetry of the system .",
    "interaction induced translational symmetry breaking phases have been studied previously in the honeycomb lattice in the absence of magnetic field @xcite .",
    "effect of interactions on the hofstadter butterfly has been studied in the past using mean field approximation in both square lattice @xcite and honeycomb lattice ( for dirac fermions)@xcite . electron electron interaction in square lattice in magnetic field has also been studied using exact diagonalization method @xcite . however",

    "moreover , the effect of interactions on the experimental probe of the hofstadter butterfly , the landau fan diagram , has not been mentioned in previous work .    in interacting systems ,",

    "the answer to this puzzle comes from examining the energy bands of the non - interacting system .",
    "we observe that for flux per plaquette @xmath7 , at low filling , @xmath62 bands come close to each other and the energy gap between these bands decreases with the increase in @xmath19 .",

    "the hofstadter butterfly described in the previous section is defined for the non - interacting case in terms of the single particle energies and the single particle gaps .",

    "while this is often the case , it is not always so .",
    "for example , in the case of quantum hall skyrmions @xcite , the order parameter deforms locally when one electron is added to the system and the gap can get reduced by a factor of 2 .",
    "when we solve our mean field equations for a dilute density of fermions in the @xmath127 band , we find that even for very small filling the mean field hamiltonian and consequently the ground state changes significantly i.e @xmath129 is quite different from @xmath130 even for small @xmath131 .",
    "we feel that this may imply that the order parameters deform locally when an extra particle is added and hence that the mean field gap is not reliable .",

    "we consider only the filled band cases where the mean field theory is reliable .",
    "while we do not know the single particle energy gaps , nevertheless , we can take the band edge to be the single particle energy of the highest occupied level ( which is the chemical potential ) .",
    "hence , to investigate the effects of the interactions on the hofstadter butterfly , we first plot the magnetic flux per plaquette versus the maximum energy of the band for the non - interacting case and show that this plot also shows the self - similar structure .",

    "[ fig:7c ] .",
    "the fact that the fractal structure increasingly disintegrates with the increase in the interaction strength is a consequence of the increase in the number of phase transitions with the increase in the interaction strength .",
    "the @xmath78 block contains energy bands near half filling which , as seen from fig .  [ fig:1 ] , have very high probability of phase transitions which increases with @xmath13 .",
    "these phase transitions , except at exact half filling , break the translational symmetries of the system .",
    "thus , the translational symmetry breaking phase transitions seem to play a crucial role in the destruction of the fractal structure .",
    "as we have stated earlier , this can be expected on the basis of general arguments .",
    "for very dilute case , there are high number of phase transitions and they affect the @xmath82 block . however , in this case , for small value of interaction strength , the system is in symmetric phase for @xmath62 bands filled for flux @xmath7 as there is a comparatively high energy gap between the @xmath138 and @xmath139 band .",
    "thus , these high energy gaps in the @xmath82 block still remains for small interaction strength and will slowly vanish with increase in the interaction strength .",
    "experimental evidence for the hofstadter butterfly has come from the landau fan diagram .",

    "hence , @xmath72 is enough to show and analyze the landau fan diagram and realize that these topological invariants indeed satisfy the diophantine equation .",
    "as mentioned earlier , many of the landau transitions are accompanied by topological transitions where the hall conductivity of the system changes . in the presence of interactions , the topological phase transitions get reflected in the landau fan diagram as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig:9c ] , for @xmath53 , the points with the same hall conductivities can not be joined to form a straight line as most of the points are scattered .",

    "moreover , we can see that most of the region near half filling have a topological transition to zero hall conductivity as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig:9 ] , it is clear that due to the topological transitions accompanying the phase transitions to spatial symmetry breaking phases , the points with same hall conductivity in the landau fan diagram are more scattered and the number of transitions to zero hall conductivity near the half filling increases as the interaction strength is increased .",
    "in addition , on using the same diophantine equation as for the non - interacting case , @xmath147 no longer remains an integer .",
    "for example , for @xmath53 and @xmath156 , @xmath157 , so @xmath158 .",
    "hence , the diophantine equation used for the non - interacting case is no more valid in the presence of interactions .",
    "we have studied spinless fermions on the honeycomb lattice with nearest neighbor hopping and nearest neighbor interaction in the presence of magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic flux per plaquette is of the form @xmath7 with @xmath17 being co - prime integers and @xmath159 , @xmath160 .",
    "we solve this interacting problem in the mean field approximation for the filled band cases .",
    "in particular , we look for translation symmetry broken phases and study the effect of these phase transitions on the hofstadter butterfly and the landau fan diagram .    we find that a large number of the systems at different values of flux and filling exhibit these transitions .",
    "many of the transitions are also topological , i.e. the symmetry breaking is accompanied by a change in the hall conductivity . when the number of transitions is plotted with respect to the filling factor , we find that they are peaked near the dilute limit and near half - filling .",
    "we have provided an explanation of this feature based on the bunching of bands in the non - interacting system .",
    "the number of these phase transitions increases with the increase in the interaction strength as expected .",
    "the hofstadter butterfly is generally understood as arising from the interplay of the two length scales in the system , the periodicity of the potential and the magnetic length .",
    "the translation symmetry breaking introduces a third length scale into the system and hence we expect a strong effect of it on the fractal structure .",
    "we have shown that this is indeed so .",
    "the self similarity structure of the energy spectrum disintegrates as a result of these transitions .",
    "the amount of disintegration increases with the strength of the interactions .",
    "this result is with respect to the choice of the unit cell shown in fig.[fig:0 ] , corresponding to a particular pattern of translation symmetry breaking . in this choice",
    ", the translational symmetry is broken only in the @xmath24 direction",
    ". there could be states with different patterns of symmetry breaking with lower energy and hence for many fillings and flux values , the translation symmetry could break at a smaller interaction strength than our case .",
    "thus if all patterns of translation symmetry breaking were taken into account , we may expect the hofstadter butterfly to disintegrate at lower interaction strengths than shown in this work .",
    "landau fan diagram is the experimental manifestation of the hofstadter butterfly .",
    "we show that the change in the hall conductivity in the transitions gets reflected in the landau fan diagram .",
    "the points with same hall conductivity no longer lie in a straight line and are rather scattered . on increasing the interaction strength , there are more number of topological transitions and thus it becomes difficult to join the points with same hall conductivities in a straight line as they get more scattered in the landau fan diagram . in the presence of interaction , the diophantine equation used for non - interacting case",
    "does not hold .",
    "hence we have shown that interactions disintegrate the hofstadter butterfly .",
    "further , the landau fan diagram also drastically changes and the diophantine equation obeyed by the topological invariants in the non - interacting system breaks down in the interacting system ."
