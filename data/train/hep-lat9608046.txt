    "since the late 1960 s , deep - inelastic scattering of unpolarised leptons and nucleons has been studied experimentally .",
    "the inclusive cross section for electroproduction can be described in terms of the structure functions @xmath0 and @xmath1 related to the densities of quarks and gluons in the nucleon ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "there is also some more indirect information on pion structure functions .",
    "deep - inelastic scattering of longitudinally polarised leptons and nucleons allows one to measure two more structure functions , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the observed scaling violations could be understood in the framework of _ perturbative _ qcd the computation of the structure functions themselves requires a _ nonperturbative _ method , e.g.  lattice gauge theory and monte carlo simulations @xcite . in this talk",
    "i shall describe recent attempts to calculate hadron structure functions on the lattice .",
    "an alternative method using the hamiltonian version of lattice gauge theory is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    instead of calculating the structure functions directly ,",
    "we compute hadronic matrix elements of certain operators which , through the operator product expansion , are related to moments of the structure functions . in the deep - inelastic limit",
    ", the leading contribution is given by @xmath4 @xmath5 here @xmath6 ; @xmath7 labels the contributing operators , and @xmath8 is the renormalisation scale needed to define the ( reduced ) matrix elements @xmath9 .",
    "the wilson coefficients @xmath10 are calculated in perturbation theory and depend on @xmath11 as well as on the coupling constant @xmath12 .",
    "the operators we have to deal with are the `` 2-quark operators '' ( for @xmath13 ) @xmath14{0cm}{$d$}\\raisebox{1.7ex}{$\\leftrightarrow$}$_{\\!\\mu_2}$ } } \\cdots { \\mbox {    \\parbox[b]{0cm}{$d$}\\raisebox{1.7ex}{$\\leftrightarrow$}$_{\\!\\mu_n}$ } } q\\ ] ] ( @xmath15 = covariant derivative ) and ( for @xmath16 ) purely gluonic operators , which contribute only in the flavour - singlet sector . for the nucleon the matrix elements @xmath9",

    "@xmath35 is interpreted as the fraction of the nucleon spin carried by the quarks of flavour @xmath23 .",
    "now the challenge for lattice qcd is the calculation of the reduced matrix elements @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "so we have to compute forward hadron matrix elements of ( relatively complicated ) composite operators .",
    "these matrix elements are calculated from three - point correlation functions . with suitable operators",
    "@xmath39 , @xmath40 for the particle to be studied , e.g.  the nucleon , we can write schematically for @xmath41 @xmath42 on a lattice with time extent @xmath43 .",
    "correspondingly we have for the two - point function @xmath44 so we can determine the desired matrix elements from ratios of the form @xmath45 which should be independent of @xmath46 for @xmath47 .",
    "the bare lattice operators have of course to be renormalised and may mix with other operators in the process of renormalisation . in the euclidean continuum",
    "we should study operators like @xmath48{0cm}{$d$}\\raisebox{1.7ex}{$\\leftrightarrow$}$_{\\!\\mu_2}$ } } \\cdots { \\mbox {    \\parbox[b]{0cm}{$d$}\\raisebox{1.7ex}{$\\leftrightarrow$}$_{\\!\\mu_n}$ } } q \\,,\\ ] ] @xmath49{0cm}{$d$}\\raisebox{1.7ex}{$\\leftrightarrow$}$_{\\!\\mu_1}$ } } \\cdots { \\mbox {    \\parbox[b]{0cm}{$d$}\\raisebox{1.7ex}{$\\leftrightarrow$}$_{\\!\\mu_n}$ } } q\\ ] ] or rather o(4 ) irreducible multiplets with definite c - parity .",
    "in particular , we obtain twist-2 operators by symmetrising the indices and subtracting the traces . in the flavour - nonsinglet case they do not mix and are hence multiplicatively renormalisable .    working with wilson fermions ( as we do )",
    "it is straightforward to write down lattice versions of the above operators .",
    "one simply replaces the continuum covariant derivative by its lattice analogue .",
    "however , o(4 ) being restricted to its finite subgroup h(4 ) ( the hypercubic group ) on the lattice , the constraints imposed by space - time symmetry are less stringent than in the continuum",
    ". in particular , a multiplet of operators which is irreducible with respect to o(4 ) will in general decompose into _ several _ irreducible h(4 ) multiplets and the possibilities for mixing increase @xcite .",
    "our simulations were performed on quadrics parallel computers .",
    "we have worked on lattices of size @xmath50 and @xmath51 at @xmath52 in the quenched approximation . for more technical details",
    "see refs .",
    "most of our data were obtained with the wilson action for the gauge fields and the quarks .",
    "first results from simulations with an improved fermionic action will however be discussed below ( for more details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the values of @xmath53 , @xmath54 and the ( approximate ) number of configurations used for the calculation of the nucleon matrix elements are the following :    [ cols=\">,<,^,^ \" , ]",
    "as in the case of the unpolarised structure functions , the chiral extrapolation of the @xmath55 data @xcite is confirmed by the results obtained on the @xmath51 lattice at smaller quark masses .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig : deltaq ] for the case of @xmath56 . in the chiral limit",
    "we find @xmath57    these numbers should be compared with the fraction of the proton spin carried by the valence quarks ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath58 again one might hope that the difference of @xmath59 and @xmath60 contributions is less sensitive to quenching .",
    "one finds @xmath61 to be compared with the axial vector coupling constant @xmath62 .    in the higher moments of @xmath2 sea quark effects",
    "are also expected to be suppressed so that the quenched results should be reasonably close to the experimental numbers . for the proton",
    "we find @xmath63 where @xmath64 .",
    "the e143 collaboration obtains in a recent analysis 0.0121(10 ) @xcite .",
    "in fig.[fig : pion ] we summarise our results for the valence quark distribution in the pion obtained on a @xmath55 lattice @xcite .",
    "we used the same operators as in the nucleon case . like for @xmath65 in the proton , @xmath66 is consistently larger than @xmath67 .",
    "the three filled squares on the right represent the heavy quark limit , whereas those on the left are calculated from a phenomenological valence quark distribution @xcite .",
    "wilson s fermion action suffers from @xmath68 lattice artifacts . in order to suppress them at least in on - shell quantities , sheikholeslami and",
    "wohlert @xcite added the so - called clover term @xmath69 to the action , where @xmath70 is the clover - leaf lattice version of the field strength . for the coefficient @xmath71 one obtains in lowest - order perturbation theory @xmath72 .",
    "a nonperturbative determination is however possible as the alpha collaboration has shown @xcite . for @xmath52",
    "they find the optimal value @xmath73 @xcite , which should reduce the discretisation errors from @xmath68 to @xmath74 .",
    "since a `` canonical '' value of @xmath71 has not yet emerged , we have extended our perturbative calculation of renormalisation constants for the local 2-quark operators to the sheikholeslami - wohlert action with arbitrary @xmath71 @xcite .    in order to improve matrix elements such as those considered here one needs in addition improved operators .",
    "we have obtained first results with perturbatively improved operators on a @xmath55 lattice at @xmath52 and @xmath73 @xcite . the value of @xmath75 in the chiral limit changes to 1.22(14 ) for @xmath73 leading to better agreement with the experimental result 1.26 .",
    "this talk has described recent attempts to calculate hadron structure functions on the lattice . in the quenched approximation ,",
    "at least the lower moments can be calculated with reasonable statistical accuracy .    concerning the systematic uncertainties we can make the following statements :    * the comparison of results from @xmath55 and @xmath51 lattices does not reveal large finite size effects .",
    "* the extrapolation to the chiral limit seems to be smooth . in the range of quark masses that we studied we did not observe any unexpected mass dependence with the possible exception of @xmath76 .",
    "* as a check for cut - off effects we calculated @xmath77 from two different lattice operators .",
    "the outcome indicates that these effects are not too large .",
    "first results obtained with a nonperturbatively improved fermion action look promising .",
    "still there are further sources of systematic errors due to the renormalisation constants , the contributions of purely gluonic operators and fermion - line disconnected parts of 2-quark operators , etc .",
    "a major problem is , of course , the quenched approximation .",
    "however , the overall agreement with the real world is already rather satisfactory , at least as far as quantities are concerned which are expected to be less sensitive to quenching .",
    "this work was supported in part by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft .",
    "the numerical calculations were performed on the quadrics parallel computers at bielefeld university and at desy ( zeuthen ) .",
