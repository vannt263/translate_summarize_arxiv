    "in the papers @xcite and @xcite , berkovich defined the formal nearby cycle functor for a formal scheme @xmath0 over a complete discrete valuation ring @xmath1 , and proved the comparison result that if @xmath0 is obtained by completing a scheme @xmath2 locally of finite type over @xmath1 along a closed subscheme @xmath3 of the special fiber @xmath4 of @xmath2 , then the formal nearby cycle is isomorphic to the restriction of the nearby cycle @xmath5 of @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , @xmath6 depends only on the completion of @xmath2 along @xmath3 for @xmath7 .",
    "the theory of berkovich plays an important role in the study of the cohomology of shimura varieties and rapoport - zink spaces ; for example , see @xcite and @xcite .    in this paper , we introduce variants of berkovich s formal nearby cycle and investigate their properties . for simplicity ,",

    "our results are roughly summarized in the following theorem :    [ thm : main - thm ] for a locally noetherian excellent formal scheme @xmath0 over @xmath8 such that @xmath9 is separated , and a pair @xmath10 of closed formal subschemes of the special fiber @xmath11 of @xmath0 , we can define the object @xmath12 of @xmath13 ( for the definition of excellent schemes , see section [ subsec : formal ] ) .",

    "for a general formal scheme , we patch the local construction above by using the simplicial technique .",
    "we sketch the outline of the paper . in section 2",
    ", we collect some facts which are required to construct @xmath12 .",
    "in particular , the content in section [ subsec : formal ] is crucial for our construction . in section 3",
    ", we give a definition of our nearby cycle @xmath12 and prove various properties on it . in section 4 ,",
    "we compare our theory with the theory of rigid spaces .",
