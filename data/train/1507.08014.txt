    "however , it is much more challenging to observe the long - time dynamics of a bec in high orbitals because of the difficulty to prepare the cold atoms in such states and maintain their quantum coherence . for the condensate with a wide quasi - momentum distribution in p - band  @xcite , the quantum dynamics for the holding time being shorter than 1.3 ms were studied .    here",
    "we experimentally prepare a bec in the p - band of an optical lattice using a non - adiabatic shortcut method and study its long time quantum dynamics .",

    "for the first one and a half milliseconds , the momentum states undergo fast oscillations . after a brief intermediate interval ,",
    "the bec starts a different type of oscillations which have a much longer period ( @xmath1 14.9ms ) and last up to 60ms .",
    "we find that these long - period oscillations are due to the presence of an additional harmonic trap , and the dephasing induced by the nonlinear interaction is greatly helpful for this oscillation behavior .",

    "most recently , this method is proposed to study anisotropic two - dimensional bose gas  @xcite .",
    "we use two acousto - optic modulators to form our designed pulse sequences with the frequency difference @xmath13mhz which corresponds to a phase shift between two pulses series by @xmath14 .",
    "this phase shift is crucial to change the parity of the ground state and thus prepare the state in the p - band .",

    "the details of the pulse series are shown in the supplementary material .",

    "to study the dynamical evolution after a bec is prepared in the quantum state of the p - band , we hold the condensate for time @xmath19 before measuring the momentum distribution of the ultracold atoms after a time of flight ( tof ) of 28ms . the momentum distributions of the bec at @xmath200ms , 2ms , 5ms , 7ms , 30ms are shown in the first row of fig .  1(a1 , a2 , a3 , a4 , a5 ) . an evolution is clearly observed .",

    "1(b ) are beating signal due to coherent superposition of different bands .",
    "in real experiment , it is impossible to prepare a quantum state completely in the p - band .",

    "the calculated decay time is @xmath46ms .",
    "it is coincident to the fitting result ( @xmath47ms ) based on the experimental data , and the decay rate in experiment is larger which can be attributed to other mechanism including dephasing of the atom cloud .",
    "considering its finite size , the condensate has a narrow quasi - momentum distribution around @xmath0 with a width of @xmath48 .",
    "our numerical simulation finds that the calculated decay time would increase by about @xmath49 , and numerical simulation shows the influence of this distribution to oscillation frequency is also negligible .",
    "the rapid oscillations disappear at about @xmath50ms . after a featureless short dynamical evolution ,",
    "a different type of oscillations begin to emerge at around 2ms . as shown in fig .",
    "1(c ) , these oscillations have a much longer period of about @xmath51ms and their oscillating amplitude subsides gradually and becomes zero around @xmath52ms after five cycles .",
    "this is different to the oscillation period of the harmonic trap @xmath53ms . if we consider this evolution based on the semi - classical model with an effective potential , where the atoms exerted a variable force due to the harmonic trap and quasi - momentum dependent effective mass , as shown in the supplementary material , we see that the period is identical to the experimental result .",
    "different to the bloch oscillation for atoms on s - band  @xcite , however , our analysis shows that these long - period oscillations for atoms on p - band are greatly affected by the nonlinear dephasing , and this semi - classical model can not fully coincident to the experimental observation .",

    "[ figure4](a ) are the momentum distributions measured experimentally for holding times up to 15ms , which is roughly the first cycle of the oscillations . at @xmath54ms , the momentum mainly distributes around @xmath16 with @xmath0 , which is the signature of the initial state in the p - band . at @xmath55ms , the absolute value of the peak quasi - momentum becomes smaller than @xmath56 .",
    "this is due to that the kinetic energy is transferred into the potential energy by the harmonic trap . at @xmath57ms , the atoms spread to the full regime between @xmath7 and @xmath58 . at @xmath59ms , the atoms concentrate around @xmath60 , an indication of the quantum state has moved to the brillouin zone edge of the p - band ( fig .",

    "most of the atoms have moved back to positions around @xmath16 .",

    "it is quite surprising that the simulation without interatomic interaction ( blue dashed curve ) does nt show clear periodic behavior , which differs significantly with the experiment . both in experiment and theoretical simulation",
    ", the interaction has an effect of stabilizing the oscillation .",
    "this is counterintuitive by noticing that ( i ) the repulsive interaction has the effect of widening the wave packet and thus it seems that it should destroy the oscillation ; ( ii ) the interaction usually plays a role of destroying the quantum coherence because of the nonlinear interaction .    to solve this puzzle , we consider the following evolution of the order parameter of the condensate ,    @xmath64    here @xmath65 is the number of atoms initially in the @xmath66th lattice site , and @xmath67 with @xmath68 the wannier wave function located in the @xmath69th lattice site and @xmath70 the corresponding coefficient . for atoms in @xmath66th site , initial situation is @xmath71 . during evolution of the single site wave function",

    "the contribution of both the kinetic energy and potential energy to the phase @xmath73 is the same for every lattice site .",
    "however , the phase due to the interatomic interaction is proportional to each site s atom number which could be quite different for neighboring lattice sites . as shown in fig .  [ figure5](c ) , the phase difference between neighboring lattice sites appears completely random because of interatomic interaction at @xmath57ms . in a sense ,",
    "the relative phase between neighboring sites is pseudorandom because it appears random only after the relative phase is confined between @xmath74 and @xmath75 .    in this case ,",
    "when the density distribution or momentum distribution is considered , the interference term between different @xmath70 could be omitted , i.e. @xmath76 with the above approximate expression , we solve every @xmath77 by the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation ( dnlse ) @xcite , and then get the momentum distribution , as shown with the green dotted lines in figs .",

    "it is natural that the incoherent superposition in eq.([eqn : disgpe ] ) will also have the long time periodic oscillation . for @xmath21",
    "the gpe agrees better with the experiment than the method of dnlse and eq.([eqn : disgpe ] ) , while here the dnlse simulation shows the physical picture more clearly .    to verify further the role of random phase in the appearance of the long - time period behavior , we add this random phase artificially for noninteracting case and solve numerically the schrdinger equation .",

    "in addition , there is no clear periodic behavior in this case .",
    "the simulation with gpe does nt agree well with the experimental result .",
    "this may due to the fact that at @xmath81 , the particle number is highly squeezed so that there is a breakdown of the mean - field theory , which induces the disappearance of the interference between @xmath77 .",
    "it seems that the theoretical simulation with gpe for @xmath82 agrees better with the experiment than the method with dnlse .     versus time @xmath19 for @xmath63 ( a ) and @xmath81 ( b ) .",
