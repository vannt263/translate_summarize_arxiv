    "elastoresistivity relates changes of resistivity of a solid conductor to strains that it experiences .",
    "since resistivity and strain are both 2nd rank tensors , the elastoresistivity is a 4th rank tensor , defined by the following expression : @xmath70 in the absence of a magnetic field , the onsager reciprocal relation holds for the electrical conductivity , and the associated symmetry properties of the resistivity and strain tensors allow us to more conveniently express them as six component vectors , such that @xmath71 where@xmath72 . using this voigt notation ,",
    "the elastoresistivity is represented by a pseudo - second rank tensor . for a tetragonal crystal ,",
    "the point group symmetry allows us to further simplify the elasotresistivity tensor : @xmath73 in the following sections , we describe how the elastoresistivity coefficients @xmath74 and @xmath35 are related to the nematic susceptibility for the @xmath19 and @xmath16 symmetry channels , and how these coefficients can be measured .",
    "these ideas were first described in ref @xcite .      in an experiment ,",
    "the resistance of a sample is measured , not the resistivity .",
    "the associated elastoresistance , i.e. the change of resistance of a sample due to deformation , is related to the elastoresistivity by : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the separation of voltage leads and @xmath77 is the cross section area of the current path . in a simple metal , such as copper ,",
    "the elastoresistivity coefficients are small , and the elastoresistance is dominated by the geometric factor ( the latter two terms in equation s5 ) . however , in semiconductors or strongly correlated materials the elastoresistivity coefficients can be much larger than the geometric effect @xcite . in the analysis described in the main text ,",
    "the geometric factor is responsible for the small , temperature independent term @xmath78 .",
    "single crystals were grown via standard self flux techniques , as described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "thin bars were cut from larger crystals such that the tetragonal c - axis was perpendicular to the plane of the thin bars , and the a - axis aligned either along the length of the bars ( suitable for probing the b@xmath79 channel ) or at 45 degrees ( for b@xmath3 ) .",
    "anisotropic strain was achieved by gluing these thin crystals to the side surface of a pzt piezoelectric stack@xcite , with the bars aligned along the principle @xmath52 and @xmath80 axes of the stack . by applying a positive voltage bias through",
    "the voltage leads , the pzt stack expands along the long dimension and contracts along the transverse direction .",
    "we define the direction along the long dimension as the @xmath80-direction and the transverse direction as @xmath52-direction ( see fig . 5 ) .",
    "the resistance of pairs of mutually transverse samples was measured simultaneously while the voltage applied to the pzt stack was varied ( typically for three full hysteresis loops between -50 v and + 150 v ) . a photograph and illustration of the configuration of a typical experiment probing the differential elastoresistance of two such samples",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "5 .    neglecting the geometric factors ( which",
    ", as described above , contribute a small temperature - independent term to the elastoresistance ) , the change of resistance for a thin bar sample cut along the tetragonal @xmath81-axis and glued along the @xmath52-direction can be expressed by the following : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the poisson s ratio of the pzt stack and @xmath84 is the effective poisson s ratio of the sample glued to the stack .",
    "similarly , for the sample glued along the @xmath80-direction : @xmath85 by taking the difference of the change of the resistance of the two samples , one obtains : @xmath86 alternatively , by cutting the crystals in to bars oriented at 45 degrees with respect to the tetragonal @xmath81-axis , it can be easily shown via coordinate transformation that the difference of the change of the resistance of the two samples can be expressed by the following : @xmath87 where @xmath52 and @xmath80 refer to the principle axes of the pzt stack ( as illustrated in fig .",
    "5 ) and not the crystallographic axes . since",
    "@xmath88 and @xmath89 can be measured directly by the strain gauges glued on the back of the pzt stacks@xcite , we can directly extract the elastoresistivity coefficients by fitting the linear slope of @xmath90 as a function of strain .",
    "an example of the linear fitting can be found in fig .",
    "further details of the technique and the associated description of the elastoresistance can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite     and transverse ( @xmath91 elastoresistance for the @xmath16 symmetry channel.(b)@xmath92 as a function of anisotropic strain @xmath93 at several temperatures for the optimally doped ba(fe@xmath94ni@xmath95)@xmath2as@xmath2 .",
    "black lines show linear fits for each temperature , from which the elatoresistivity coefficient @xmath35 is extracted .",
    "strains are positive for extension , and negative for compression . ,",
    "title=\"fig:\",width=321][figs1 ]      we use a standard two part epoxy@xcite to glue the samples on to the sidewall of the pzt stacks . it was found that the ability of the stack to transmit the strain to the sample depends on the choice of glue and the thickness and elastic properties of the sample@xcite . to confirm that the strain was fully transmitted to the samples , strain gauges were glued both on the back side of the stack and on top of a larger test crystal@xcite .",
    "we found that the strain is essentially fully transmitted for sample thicknesses below approximately 100@xmath96 m ; measurements presented in this paper were made for samples with thicknesses between 50 and 100@xmath96 m .",
    "the order parameter of a nematic phase is represented by a traceless symmetric tensor . in the case of the electronic nematic phase",
    ", there is no single , unique representation , since any traceless symmetric tensor that measures the equilibrium electronic properties can represent the order parameter@xcite .",
    "the dimensionless resistivity anisotropy is a traceless symmetric tensor , @xmath97 however , resistivity anisotropy does not purely measure the equilibrium electronic properties , but is determined by the anisotropy in the electronic structure _ and _ the anisotropy in the scattering rate ; the latter being a dynamical property of the system .",
    "nevertheless , one can still express the true nematic order parameter @xmath98 as a function of the resistivity anisotropy @xmath99 and take a taylor expansion for small value of @xmath99 , for which the leading term is linear .",
    "therefore , for small value of @xmath99 , which applies to our measurements ( which are all in the linear regime ) , it can be related to the true nematic order parameter via a proportionality constant @xmath99 = @xmath100 . in our experiment setup",
    ", the strain can be considered as a symmetry breaking field conjugate to the electron nematic order parameter .",
    "therefore we can define the nematic susceptibility as the quantity that relates the induced order parameter and symmetry breaking strain .",
    "in particular , for a tetragonal crystal : @xmath101 where @xmath52 and @xmath80 refer here to the [ 100 ] and [ 010 ] crystal axes .",
    "therefore the elastoresistivity coefficient is related to the bare nematic susceptibility via the same proportionality constant @xmath28 .",
    "the proportionality constant @xmath28 depends on the microscopic details of the electronic structure , the precise definition given to the nematic order parameter , and , in some cases , the nature of the disorder scattering , and in general could be temperature and materials dependent .",
    "however , two experimental observations of iron based superconductors suggest that @xmath28 is a constant within a wide range of temperatures and independent to a certain degree of disorder@xcite .",
    "first , the temperature dependence of the elastoresistivity coefficient @xmath35 of the parent compounds bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 can be perfectly fitted by a curie - weiss function ( fig . 1 of main paper )",
    ", which is exactly the same functional form of @xmath53 derived by a ginzburg - landau theory .",
    "second , the elastoresistivity coefficient @xmath35 of bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 has been measured for crystals with different residual resistance ratios ( rrr ) , which is a measure of crystalline disorder @xcite .",
    "it was found that @xmath35 is independent of the rrr of the sample .",
    "a similar result is found for underdoped compositions of co- and ni - doped bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 which have the same neel temperature @xcites .",
    "the perfect fitting to curie - weiss in these conditions strongly suggest that @xmath28 remains a constant over a wide range of temperatures and different degrees of disorder .",
    "the main subject of our paper is the observation of a divergence of the differential elastoresistance that we have found for many different optimally doped compositions of fe - based superconductors .",
    "however , beyond this main result several other features of the data are of interest in their own right and deserve additional comment . in this section",
    "we particularly emphasize two aspects of the elastoresistance of optimally doped ba@xmath32k@xmath33fe@xmath2as@xmath2 . first ; whereas our measurements , described in the main text , reveal that the sign of the @xmath35 elastoresistivity coefficient is _ negative _ for co , ni and p substituted bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 , we find that it is _ positive _ for k - doped 122 .",
    "second , the absolute magnitude of the coefficient is comparable for all four materials .",
    "both of these observations warrant some additional commentary .    for co , ni and p substituted 122 , the negative sign of m@xmath102 in the tetragonal phase ( for temperatures above the structural transition temperature , @xmath103 ) is consistent with the resistivity anisotropy that is observed for detwinned crystals in the orthorhombic state for temperatures _ below _",
    "@xmath103 @xcite .",
    "that is , the resistivity in the tetragonal phase _ decreases _ as the sample is stretched along the current direction .    for 122 ,",
    "the in - plane resistivity anisotropy has also been measured up to @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "it was observed that for @xmath105 , the sign of resistivity anisotropy is the same as that of the parent compound and co - doped 122 .",
    "but for @xmath106 , the sign of resistivity anisotropy was found to reverse ; i.e. the resistivity was found to be _ higher _ for the longer lattice constant direction .",
    "our observation of a positive value for @xmath35 for optimal - doped 122 which has a potassium concentration @xmath107 , confirms this dramatic change in sign of the resistive anisotropy for sufficient hole doping .",
    "significantly , our measurement is made in the tetragonal state , and therefore is not complicated by issues associated with the reconstruction of the fermi surface in the antiferromagnetic state , or by concerns associated with detwinning crystals in the orthorhombic state .    despite the agreement in terms of the sign of the resistive anisotropy for sufficiently doped 122 ,",
    "the relative magnitude of the anisotropy of detwinned underdoped compositions is quite different to the strain - induced elastoresistance near optimal doping .",
    "the magnitude of the resistivity anisotropy of detwinned crystals of underdoped k - substituted 122 was found to be rather small @xcite .",
    "this observation has been interpretted by some authors as evidence supporting the notion that the resistivity anisotropy derives from anisotropic scattering associated with lattice defects , which acquire an anisotropy due to the nematic fluctuations@xcite .",
    "within such a scenario , defects in the feas planes are believed to have a stronger effect , and hence would naturally yield a larger resistivity ansiotropy , than defects that lie away from the feas plane ( as would be the case for k substitution ) , potentially accounting for the significantly lower resistivity anisotropy observed for detwinned underdoped 122 relative to 122 .",
    "our measurements , however , reveal a comparable magnitude ( within a factor of two ) for @xmath35 of optimally doped co - substituted and k - substituted 122 , in contrast to the much larger difference in the resistivity anisotropy in the orthorhombic state for underdoped compositions .",
    "clearly k substitution per se does not necessarily imply a small resistive anisotropy .",
    "there are three possible explanations for the small anisotropy that was previously measured in the orthorhombic state for k - substituted bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 .",
    "firstly , it is possible that the resistivity anisotropy has a small magnitude simply because it changes sign as a function of composition , and therefore must go through zero for some composition .",
    "secondly , it is possible that the fs reconstruction in the antiferromagnetic state affects the resistivity anisotropy differently for electron and hole doped cases .",
    "finally , it is also possible that the samples used for the study of underdoped compositions were not fully detwinned , although this seems less likely given the careful characterization of the twin populations by the authors @xcite . at present , it is not clear which of these possibilities is responsible for the small resistivity anisotropy of underdoped samples of 122 in the antiferromagnetic orthorhombic state .    bearing this in mind , p - substitution gives another useful insight to the origin of the resistive anisotropy . beyond the residual resistivity ,",
    "another good measure of the disorder affecting transport in the fe plane is the presence or absence of quantum oscillations .",
    "p - substituted samples exhibit quantum oscillations across the phase diagram ( at least on the overdoped side@xcite , ) indicating a much lower elastic scattering rate than the other compounds we have discussed so far , for which quantum oscillations are not observed .",
    "significantly , @xmath35 of the p - substituted samples is comparably large to that of co , ni and k doping , despite the lower elastic scattering rate , implying that the physical origin of the dominant contribution to the resistive anisotropy is unlikely to be associated with scattering from anisotropic defects , contrary to suggestions advanced in ref .",
    "@xcite , even though such effects are necessarily present .",
    "the observations described above serve to emphasize an important point ; that elastoresistance measurements for @xmath108 are the most relevant data to compare with theories of the resistivity anisotropy in the nematic phase , rather than comparison with transport anisotropies in the low t neel and/or orthorhombic state measured in samples detwinned by uni - axial stress .",
    "there are several reasons , but primarily because ( a ) there are no concerns about degree of detwinning ( in the tetragonal phase the material is homogeneous , and homogeneously strained ) ; ( b ) there are no issues with back - folding of bands and fs reconstruction ; and ( c ) we have precise knowledge of the strain experienced by the material ( which is not known for detwinned samples , for which the amount of strain depends on the temperature dependent elastic modulus ) . in other words , in selecting transport data to compare with theoretical predictions for resistive anisotropy , elastoresistance measurements provide the more quantitatively controlled experimental perspective .",
    "for reference , we show in figure 6 , the temperature - dependence of the resistivity for the same samples for which elastoresistance data are shown in the main text .",
    "the data were taken for free - standing ( unstrained , and unattached ) crystals .",
    "data are plotted as r / r(300k ) to eliminate uncertainty in geometric factors .",
    "the `` 11 '' family of iron chacogenides ( ) provide an interesting example of the richness of the phase diagram of iron based superconductors . at the tellurium end of the phase diagram",
    ", fe@xmath109te possesses a different antiferromagnetic ground state ; the antiferromagnetic order is a bicollinear order with an ordering wave - vector that is 45@xmath110 to that in iron pnictides@xcite . consequently the spontaneous strain developed in the symmetry breaking phase is @xmath93 ( b@xmath79 ) rather than @xmath111 ( b@xmath3 ) . on the other hand , at the selenium end of the phase diagram , fese only has a structural transition that develops a spontaneous b@xmath3 strain @xmath111 without any long range magnetic order@xcite .",
    "the optimal doped fete@xmath32se@xmath33 we measured in this work has a @xmath112 and there is no sign of phase transitions other than the superconducting transition .",
