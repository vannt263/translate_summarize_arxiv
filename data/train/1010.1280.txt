    "the famous landau - zener ( lz ) model @xcite is the most popular tool for estimating the transition probability between two states whose energies cross in time .",
    "this model assumes a constant interaction of infinite duration and linear energies . owing to some mathematical subtleties",
    ", the lz model often provides more accurate results than anticipated ( given the rather simple time dependence of the lz hamiltonian ) when applied to real physical systems with more sophisticated time dependences .",
    "the popularity of the lz model is further motivated by the extreme simplicity of the transition probability .",
    "the lz model has been extended to three and more levels by a number of authors .",
    "there are two main types of generalizations : single - crossing ( bow - tie ) models and multiple - crossings grid models .    in the bow - tie models all state energies cross at the same instant of time .",
    "carroll and hioe have solved the three - state bow - tie model in a special symmetric case @xcite and in the general case carroll - general .",
    "an extension of this model to @xmath0 states has been suggested @xcite and then rigorously derived by ostrovsky and nakamura @xcite .",
    "a further extension , wherein one of the levels is split into two parallel levels , has been suggested @xcite and derived @xcite by demkov and ostrovsky .",
    "an example of a bow - tie system occurs when a sequentially coupled quantum ladder of states in an atom or a molecule is driven by chirped laser pulses @xcite ; an adiabatic sweep of frequency through resonance will transfer all population from the lowest to the highest energy state , for either sign of the chirp .",
    "a bow - tie type of linkage can also occur in a rf - pulse controlled bose - einstein condensate output coupler @xcite .",
    "yet another example is the coupling pattern of rydberg sublevels in a magnetic field @xcite .    in the multiple - crossings grid models",
    "the energy diagram consists of a grid of crossings formed by two manifolds of rectilinear parallel diabatic energies that cross each other . in the demkov - osherov (",
    "do ) model @xcite , a single tilted energy crosses a set of @xmath0 parallel energies .",
    "this model has been generalized to the case when the single tilted energy is replaced by a set of @xmath1 parallel energies , which cross the other set of @xmath0 parallel energies @xcite .",
    "the special case when @xmath2 and @xmath0 are infinite ( so that the grid of crossings is periodic ) has also been solved @xcite .",
    "effects of level degeneracies and quasi - degeneracies have been studied by yurovsky and ben - reuven @xcite .    in the most general case of an asymmetric linear hamiltonian , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is diagonal , the general solution has not been derived yet , but exact results for some survival  probabilities have been conjectured @xcite and derived shytov , sinitsyn04,volkov04,volkov05 .    a variety of physical systems provide examples of multiple level crossings . amongst them",
    "we mention ladder climbing of atomic and molecular states by chirped laser pulses @xcite , optical shielding in cold atomic collisions @xcite , optical centrifuge for molecules @xcite , stark - chirped rapid adiabatic passage ( scrap ) @xcite , and creation of entaglement in many - particle systems @xcite .",
    "in fact , physical situations where multiple level crossings play a role have been discussed already in 1960 s , when the harpoon model for reactive scattering was considered @xcite .",
    "if one adds the vibrational states to the scattering picture , then one obtains a multilevel crossing model , which has been studied using the lz model @xcite .",
    "a general feature of all soluble multilevel models is that the transition probabilities @xmath5 between states @xmath6 and @xmath7 are given by very simple expressions , as in the original lz model , although the derivations are usually quite involved . in the grid models in particular , such as the do model ,",
    "the exact probabilities @xmath8 have the same form  products of lz probabilities for transition or no - transition applied at the relevant crossings  as what would be obtained by naive multiplication of lz probabilities while moving across the grid of crossings from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , without accounting for phases and interferences .",
    ".,width=283 ]    a very interesting feature of all grid models is that _ counterintuitive transitions _ , for which the level crossings appear in a wrong  order , are forbidden . in the three - state example in fig .",
    "[ fig - system ] such is the transition @xmath9 . in the adiabatic limit ,",
    "the inhibition of such transitions is easily understood : for the @xmath9 transition an adiabatic path requires the level crossing between @xmath10 and @xmath11 to occur before the crossing between @xmath11 and @xmath12 ; this is not the case here and hence there is no adiabatic path linking @xmath10 to @xmath13 . in the general case of nonadiabatic evolution , however , the inhibition of the @xmath9 transition is not so obvious because the concerned final state @xmath12 acquires some _ nonzero _ transient population during the interaction . yet in the end this population vanishes , and this is an exact result .",
    "a similar conclusion applies to more general level - crossing models @xcite as well .",
    "we have verified with numerical simulations that all ingredients of the multilevel lz models are essential for this feature : linear energies , constant interactions and infinite duration .",
    "nonlinear energies , pulsed interactions or finite interaction duration can each lead to nonzero probability for counterintuitive transitions .",
    "yurovsky _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have studied analytically and numerically the counterintuitive transition probability in two variations of the do model : ( i ) with a finite interaction duration and ( ii ) with a piecewise - linear sloped potential .",
    "they have used a perturbative approach assuming a quasidegenerate band of parallel energies and have found nonzero probabilities for counterintuitive transitions in both models .    in this paper , we derive analytically the probability for a counterintuitive transition in the simplest case of the do model involving three states , with two parallel and one slanted energy , as shown in fig .",

    "the purpose of this work is not just to show that the probability for a counterintuitive transition is nonzero but rather to derive accurate analytical estimates for it .",
    "our approach involves transformation to the adiabatic basis where the evolution is represented as a sequence of instantaneous two - state lz transitions at each crossing and adiabatic evolution elsewhere .",
    "this approach allows us to derive the transition probabilities between each pair of diabatic states , including the probability for the counterintuitive transition .",

    "our results suggest that at large @xmath124 the probability for a counterintuitive transition is proportional to the factor @xmath170 .",
    "the decrease with the interaction duration @xmath124 is expected as for @xmath133 the probability should vanish ( do model ) .",
    "the increase with the coupling @xmath171 is also anticipated since larger interaction is expected to increase weak transitions .",
    "the decrease vs the energy splitting @xmath26 between the concerned states @xmath172 and @xmath165 is natural too . the decrease vs the slope @xmath173 is more subtle .",
    "since @xmath174 is the diabatic energy of state @xmath164 , and since states @xmath172 and @xmath165 interact with each other via @xmath164 , the effective coupling duration for the transition @xmath9 depends on the slope @xmath173 : the larger the slope the smaller the duration and therefore the smaller the transition probability .",
    "the other ( `` intuitive '' ) transition probabilities exhibit similar dependences of the finite - duration corrections on the interaction parameters .",
    "we have described physical examples of coherent atomic excitation where the described counterintuitive transition can be observed .",
    "the model studied here resembles also the simple form of the multiple - ground - state quasimolecule model used to study optical shielding in magneto - optical atom traps @xcite .",
    "the saturation of optical shielding in high laser intensities has been earlier attributed to off - resonant excitation to attractive states , counterintuitive transitions or other processes including multiple partial waves @xcite .",
    "the results here show that the probability for counterintuitive transitions is clearly non - negligible and indicate that they can also play a role in the saturation of optical shielding .",
