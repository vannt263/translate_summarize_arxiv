    "the length scale of si - based electronic devices has been continuously decreasing and is approaching its technological and physical limits .",
    "thus , a considerable number of studies have been conducted to find alternative materials to further improve the performance of metal - oxide - semiconductor field - effect transistors ( mosfets ) . among the possible candidate materials ,",
    "ge has attracted considerable attention owing to ge - mosfets exhibiting higher carrier mobility than si - mosfets .",
    "one of the most important issues in the application of ge - mosfets is the accurate control of the properties of the ge / geo@xmath0 interface because it exists even at a ge / high-_k _ oxide interface .",
    "electron spin - resonance ( esr ) investigations have revealed that interfacial dangling bond ( db ) defects at ge / geo@xmath0 interface play a different role from those at si / sio@xmath0 interfaces ; @xcite a measurable density of dbs of the semiconductor surface atoms is not found at ge / geo@xmath0 interfaces although si - dbs are esr - active .    very recently ,",
    "matsubara _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and hosoi _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite demonstrated that the interface defect density at ge / geo@xmath0 interfaces is lower than that at si / sio@xmath0 interfaces when both the interfaces are fabricated with no hydrogen passivation treatment .",
    "@xcite examined by first - principles calculation the density of dbs at the ge / geo@xmath0 interface as a function of oxidation temperature by combining viscoelastic data for geo@xmath0 and the modified maxwell s model , and they addressed the lower defect density at ge / geo@xmath0 interfaces than at si / sio@xmath0 interfaces .",
    "in addition , the present authors performed a first - principles calculation of the formation energy of defects at the ge / geo@xmath0 interface during oxidation and found that hardly any defects are generated at the interface compared with the number generated at the si / sio@xmath0 interface.@xcite these theoretical calculations are in agreement with the above experiments,@xciteand the low defect density at the interface may account for the absence of dbs observed in esr experiments , consistent with the conclusions drawn in these studies .    on the other hand , from the viewpoint of the electronic structure of dbs , weber _ et al . _",
    "@xcite investigated the electronic structure of dbs in ge bulk by first - principles calculations and found that ge - dbs have an energy level below the ge valence band edge ; ge - dbs are always negatively charged and fully occupied .",
    "_ @xcite also examined the charged states of the dbs in ge bulk and found two charge - transition levels in the lower part of the band gap , indicating the occurrence of three charged states in analogy with the dbs in si , using the hybrid functional , although these two levels are below the valence band edge in the case of the local density approximation .",
    "however , weber _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have also proved that the underestimation of the energy band gap due to the local density approximation does not cause the negatively charged state of dbs by employing the @xmath1 approximation .",
    "@xcite reported that the defect state associated with the dbs lies approximately in the middle of the ge energy band gap using a model in which geo@xmath0 is piled on a ge(001 ) substrate .",
    "however , they employed pseudopotentials including a repulsive potential so that the energy band gap of ge agrees with the experimental value , and it is unclear the extent to which the deformation of the pseudopotentials affects the atomic and electronic structures at the ge / geo@xmath0 interface . although it is difficult to adhere to one of these views solely owing to the use of approximations in these theoretical calculations , the examination of the difference between the electronic structures of the dbs at si / sio@xmath0 and ge / geo@xmath0 interfaces is of importance for clarifying the electronic structure of dbs and for the realization of ge - based devices .    in this study",
    ", we investigate the electronic structures of dbs at the ( 001)ge / geo@xmath0 interface compared with those at the ( 001)si / sio@xmath0 interface by first - principles calculations to determine the reason for the absence of the distinct esr signal from dbs at the ge / geo@xmath0 interface .",
    "our findings are as follows .",
    "the electronic structure of the ge - db is notably different from that of the si - db . the ge - db state is occupied at any position of the fermi level , whereas the si - db is paramagnetic when the fermi level is near the midgap .",
    "in addition , the ge - db state couples with the interface state and its charge density distribution extends more widely than that of the si - db state .",
    "our first - principles calculation method is based on the real - space finite - difference approach,@xcite which enables us to determine a self - consistent electronic ground state with a high degree of accuracy using a timesaving double - grid technique.@xcite intensive studies by various methods have shown that the crystalline phase of sio@xmath0 can be observed down to @xmath2 10  from the interface in some cases.@xcite although no crystalline phase of geo@xmath0 has yet been experimentally observed , we adopt the same atomic configuration for the ge / geo@xmath0 interface to compare the electronic structure of dbs with that of dbs at the si / sio@xmath0 interface .",
    "our interface structure corresponds to that proposed by kageshima and shiraishi for the ( 001)si / sio@xmath0 interface during oxidation.@xcite figure  [ fig : fig1 ] shows the computational model , consisting of an @xmath3-quartz crystalline oxide layer on a ( 001 ) substrate of @xmath223  thickness . since yamasaki _",
    "et al._@xcite claimed that an effective band - gap change from si to sio@xmath0 occurs on the oxide side within 5  from the si / sio@xmath0 interface , the thickness of the oxide layer is chosen to be @xmath2 8  .",
    "the size of the supercell is taken to be 2@xmath4 2@xmath4 5@xmath5 , where @xmath5 is the experimental lattice constant of si ( 5.43  ) or ge ( 5.65  ) .",
    "the periodic boundary condition is imposed in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 directions , while the isolated boundary condition is employed in the @xmath8 direction .",
    "the dbs at the interface are generated using the procedure employed by houssa _",
    "et al._;@xcite a bridging o atom is removed and the lower db is passivated with a h atom .",

    "exchange correlation effects are treated by a local spin density approximation,@xcite and the freedom of spin is considered .",
    "the cutoff energy is set to 112 ry , which corresponds to a grid spacing @xmath12 of 0.30 a.u . , and a denser grid spacing of @xmath13 is taken in the vicinity of the nuclei with the augmentation of double - grid points.@xcite eight-@xmath14 points in the @xmath15 lateral unit cell are used for brillouin zone sampling .",

    "the lowest contours are @xmath18 @xmath19/@xmath20 and the subsequent contour lines represent values larger than @xmath18 @xmath19/@xmath20 .",
    "the meanings of the symbols are the same as those in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : fig2 ] shows the densities of states ( dos ) of the interfaces without the db , which are plotted by integrating them along the plane parallel to the interface , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 , @xmath23s are the wave functions , and @xmath24 is the energy of the states . for comparison , the dos of the interfaces without any dbs is also depicted . since we employ a model with a finite - thickness si ( ge ) substrate , the energy band gap is overestimated owing to the confinement effect ; the energy band gaps of ge / geo@xmath0 and si / sio@xmath0 are @xmath20.20 ev and @xmath20.62 ev , respectively .",
    "however , gaussian broadening of 0.22 ev is used to plot fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] and the band gap of ge is smeared out by the broadening in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] . in both the si / sio@xmath0 and ge / geo@xmath0 interfaces , the dos deep inside the substrates is not affected by the presence of the dbs .",
    "in addition , the peaks of the dos are observed at @xmath17 ev , @xmath25 ev , @xmath26 ev , and @xmath27 ev , where @xmath28 is the fermi level . the states at @xmath25 ev indicated by the black down arrows are related to the ge- ( si- ) o bonds since their charge density distributions accumulate between the ge- ( si- ) and o - atom layers , and the bunches at @xmath17 ev and accumulating just below the interfaces are the contribution of the interface states . when a db is introduced in the si / sio@xmath0 interface , the dos at @xmath25 ev decreases .",
    "instead , a state appears in the energy band gap , indicated by the white down arrow , and the fermi level is positioned at the state .",
    "the midgap state is attributed to the @xmath29 electron of the si atom because its charge density distribution exhibits bunches above and below the si atom . on the other hand ,",
    "the peak of the dos at @xmath25 ev related to the ge - o bonds becomes shallow and the dos at @xmath17 ev , denoted by the white down arrow , increases in the case of the ge / geo@xmath0 interface .",
    "in addition , the fermi level is at the valence band edge of the ge substrate .",
    "this result implies that the ge - db state of the ge / geo@xmath0 interface does not have unpaired electrons when the fermi level is in the energy band gap of the ge substrate , which agrees well with the conclusion of another first - principles calculation indicated that the ge - db state in ge bulk is below the valence band edge of ge bulk.@xcite the charge neutrality of the ge substrate might affect the ge - db state because one electron is removed from the ge substrate by the ge - db .",
    "however , no significant differences were found in the dos when additional ge layers are attached and when one electron is added to the present system .",
    "we illustrate in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] the charge density distributions of the state at the fermi level of the si / sio@xmath0 interface and the state below 0.3 ev the fermi level of the ge / geo@xmath0 interface , which correspond to the db states corresponding to the dos depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] . in the case of the si",
    "/ sio@xmath0 interface , the charge density distribution of the @xmath30 center @xcite is in agreement with the results of a previous first - principles calculation.@xcite the charge density distribution of the ge - db state is spatially more extended in the lateral direction than that of the si - db state , and we can not observe the strong contribution of the @xmath29 electron of the ge atom , which can be found in the si - db state .",
    "thus , the ge - db state couples with the interface states of the ge substrate .",
    "ge is a group iv element between si and sn , the latter being metallic , and the rutile phase is energetically more stable than the other possible phases of geo@xmath0 and sno@xmath0@xcite whereas sio@xmath0 preferentially adopts the quartz structure , maintaining its @xmath31 bonding networks .",
    "in addition , the ge - o bonds at the interface do not have a strongly preferential bonding direction.@xcite thus , the bonding network of ge / geo@xmath0 is easily deformed from the @xmath31 structure and exhibits more metallic properties than that of si / sio@xmath0 .",
    "these characteristics of ge contribute to the smaller energy variation of the ge - o bond state after the breaking of the bond than that of the si - o bond state and the coupling of the ge - db state to the ge / geo@xmath0 interface states .",
    "these results are in agreement with the experimental result by the esr microscopy,@xcite and the absence of the clear esr signal from ge - dbs is attributed to the significant difference between the electronic structures of si- and ge - dbs .",
    "our results also indicate that a db near the interface generates a fixed negative charge , creating serious problems for devices that rely on the formation of an electron channel .",
    "there remains one concern that our main conclusion might be affected by the computational models naively .",
    "for example , only a limited number of cases have been examined in the present work and the ge - db states will appear between the valence and conduction band edges in some interface atomic structures .",
    "actually , it is difficult to deny the presence of the esr - active ge - dbs only by the present result .",
    "however , the charge density distribution of the ge - db state is not strongly concentrated around the ge - db as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] and the esr signal from ge - dbs is expected to be shallow .    for the further interpretation of the electronic - structure of the db states ,",
    "let us discuss about the relationship between the db states and the deformation of the atomic structure at the interface .",
    "the interface reconstruction is caused by the lattice - constant mismatch between ge ( si ) and geo@xmath0 ( sio@xmath0 ) .",
    "the interface ge atom with the db is raised up while the si atom is pulled down so that the @xmath29 electron forms a @xmath30 center in the si substrate .",
    "the average variations of the three bond angles formed by the interface atom and two atoms at the second interface layer from the ideal diamond structure ( 109.5 degree ) is @xmath32 and @xmath33 degrees in the case of the si / sio@xmath0 and ge / geo@xmath0 interfaces , respectively .",
    "the large variation of the bond angles of the ge / geo@xmath0 interfaces is interpreted by the structural properties of geo@xmath0 and sio@xmath0 under the pressure : o - ge - o angle predominantly varies when the geo@xmath0 is compressed while si - o - si angle is deformed in the case of sio@xmath0.@xcite moreover , haneman reported in the study concerning the reconstruction of the si surface that the @xmath31 db bonds is stabilized due to the strong contribution of the @xmath9 electron when the surface atom is raised up.@xcite this result also supports our conclusion for the stabilized ge - db state and the small contribution of the @xmath29 electrons to the ge - db state as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "we have carried out first - principles calculations to examine the electronic structures of the dbs at ( 001)si / sio@xmath0 and ( 001)ge / geo@xmath0 interfaces .",
    "we found that the electronic structures of the si- and ge - dbs are markedly different ; the si - db state appears at the energy band gap of the si substrate and the position of the fermi level corresponds to the db state , whereas the ge - db state is fully occupied .",
    "moreover , the charge density of the ge - db state is more widely distributed than that of the si - db state .",
    "these characteristics are explained by the metallic properties of the bonding network of the ge / geo@xmath0 interface and the structural deformation of the ge bulk at the ge / geo@xmath0 interface .",
    "our results are in good agreement with the finding in esr measurement at the ge / geo@xmath0 interface.@xcite since we studied only limited models of interfaces , not all the details of the actual process are included . indeed , our results do not conteract the presence of the esr - active ge - db at the ge / geo@xmath0 interface , which have been reported by means of electrically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy.@xcite these findings further motivate the need for a theoretical knowledge for the relationship between the atomic structural property of ge / geo@xmath0 intarface and the esr activity of the ge - dbs .",
