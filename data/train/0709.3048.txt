    "the na48 series of experiments represents the long - term cern program in experimental kaon physics . during the 10 years of operation since 1997",
    ", several physics programs were accomplished .",
    "the experimental setup has been upgraded in the course of operation ; its principal components are a kaon beam line and a vacuum decay volume followed by a magnetic spectrometer consisting of four drift chambers , a trigger scintillator hodoscope , a liquid krypton electromagnetic calorimeter , and a muon detector  @xcite .",
    "the present paper contains a number recent precise measurements based on various data sets : 1 ) measurement of the indirect cp violation parameter @xmath0 with @xmath3 decays ; 2 ) measurement of the direct cp violating dalitz plot slope asymmetries @xmath4 in @xmath5 and @xmath6 decays ; 3 ) measurement of the ckm matrix element @xmath2 based on partial widths of the semileptonic @xmath7 decays .",
    "the interest in the measurement of the parameter @xmath8 stems , in particular , from the fact that precision measurements of this value by ktev and kloe experiments published in 2004 and 2006 , respectively , were disagreement with the previous world average by 5% , or more the four standard deviations .    the na48 measurement if @xmath0  @xcite is based on the data taken during 2 days of dedicated running in 1999 .",
    "the directly measured quantity is the ratio of the decay rates @xmath9 ; these decays are characterized by similar signatures involving two reconstructed tracks of charged particles . then @xmath0 is computed as @xmath10 in this approach the @xmath11 and @xmath12 lifetimes @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and the branching fractions @xmath15 and @xmath16 are external inputs taken from the best single measurements .",
    "the data sample contains about @xmath17 2-track triggers .",
    "event selection is rather similar for the @xmath3 and @xmath18 modes .",
    "a crucial difference is electron vs pion identification based on the ratio of energy deposition in the electromagnetic calorimeter to track momentum measured by the spectrometer .",
    "identification efficiency was measured and corrected for .",
    "samples of @xmath19 @xmath3 and @xmath20 @xmath18 candidates were selected , with about @xmath21 background contamination in each .",
    "acceptance corrections and background subtraction were performed by monte carlo simulation .",
    "trigger efficiencies were measured directly with the data and corrected for .",
    "the most relevant systematic uncertainties come from precision of simulation of kaon energy spectrum , precision of radiative corrections , and precision of trigger efficiency measurement .",
    "the final result is @xmath22 this leads , subtracting the @xmath23 direct emission contribution , but retaining the inner bremsstrahlung contribution , to @xmath24 finally , the cp violating parameter is computed according to ( [ eta - main ] ) to be @xmath25 the result in in agreement with the recent kloe and ktev measurements , while in contradiction to the world average as of 2004 .",
    "the @xmath26 and @xmath6 decays are among the most promising processes in kaon physics for a search for cp violating phenomena .",
    "the @xmath1 matrix element squared is conventionally parameterized by a polynomial expansion @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 are the so called linear and quadratic dalitz plot slope parameters ( @xmath31 ) , and the two lorentz invariant kinematic variables @xmath32 and @xmath33 are defined as @xmath34 here @xmath35 is the charged pion mass , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the kaon and pion four - momenta , the indices @xmath38 correspond to the two pions of the same electrical charge , and the index @xmath39 to the pion of different charge .",
    "a non - zero difference @xmath40 between the slope parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 describing the decays of @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively , is a manifestation of direct cp violation expressed by the corresponding slope asymmetry @xmath45 the above slope asymmetry is expected to be strongly enhanced with respect to the asymmetry of integrated decay rates .",
    "a recent full next - to - leading order chpt computation  @xcite predicts @xmath4 to be of the order of @xmath46 within the sm .",
    "calculations involving processes beyond the sm  @xcite allow a wider range of @xmath4 , including substantial enhancements up to a few @xmath47 .",
    "a measurement of the quantity @xmath4 was performed with a record data sample collected in 200304 with simultaneous @xmath43 and @xmath44 beams  @xcite .",
    "the measurement method exploits cancellations of major systematic effects due to simultaneous beams and regular inversions of magnetic fields in the beam line and setup .",
    "the samples of events selected are @xmath48 @xmath26 candidates , and @xmath49 @xmath6 candidates , practically background - free .",
    "the cp violating charge asymmetries of the linear slope parameter of the dalitz plot of the @xmath26 and @xmath6 decays were found to be @xmath50 the archived precision is more than an order of magnitude better that those of the previous measurements . the results do not show evidences for large enhancements due to non - sm physics , and can be used to constrain extensions of the sm predicting large cp violating effects .",
    "precise measurements of the ckm matrix parameter @xmath2 are of interest for tests of ckm unitarity . the @xmath51 decay rates , including the internal bremssrahlung process , is given by  @xcite @xmath52",
    ", @xmath53 is a short distance electroweak correction , @xmath54 is the phase space integral depending on form factors , @xmath55 is a long - distance correction .",
    "the analysis is based on a measurement of the ratios @xmath56 and @xmath57 using the data collected during 3 days of a dedicated run in 2003  @xcite .",
    "the data samples are @xmath58 @xmath59 candidates with 0.02% background , and @xmath60 @xmath61 candidates with 0.2% background .",
    "the following partial widths are measured : @xmath62 here the last ( dominating and correlated ) uncertainties are due to precision of the external input @xmath63 .",
    "the following values of @xmath64 were computed from @xmath59 and @xmath61 decays : @xmath65 here the dominating contribution to the uncertainty comes from the long - distance corrections . combining these results assuming @xmath66 universality and using @xmath67  @xcite ,",
    "it is obtained : @xmath68 where the second and largest uncertainty owes to the precision of @xmath69 computation .",
    "the above measurement is found to be consistent with unitarity of the ckm mixing matrix  @xcite .",
    "a number of recent kaon measurements by the na48 collaboration at cern were presented .",
    "the achieved precisions are similar to or better than the best previous ones .",
