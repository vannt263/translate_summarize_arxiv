    "lattice qcd calculations  @xcite predict a phase transition from hadronic matter to quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) at high temperatures and/or high densities .",
    "matter under such extreme conditions can be studied in the laboratory by colliding heavy nuclei at very high energies .",
    "the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory provides collisions of heavy nuclei and protons at center of mass energies up to @xmath2 = 200 gev .",
    "the initial stage of these collisions can be described as the interpenetration of the nuclei with partonic interactions at high energy . with the interactions of the partons in the system",
    ", chemical and local thermal equilibrium of the system may be reached and the qgp may form . as the system expands and cools down , it will hadronize and chemically freeze - out . after a period of hadronic interactions , the system reaches the kinetic freeze - out stage when all hadrons stop interacting  @xcite .",
    "after the kinetic freeze - out , particles free - stream towards the detectors where our measurements are performed .",
    "the typical lifetime of a resonance is a few fm/@xmath15 , which is comparable to the expected lifetime of the hot and dense matter produced in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite . in a hot and dense system , resonances are in close proximity with other strongly interacting hadrons .",
    "the in - medium effect related to the high density and/or high temperature of the medium can modify various resonance properties , such as masses , widths , and even the mass line shapes  @xcite .",
    "thus , measurements of various resonance properties can provide detailed information about the interaction dynamics in relativistic heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "recent measurements  @xcite by the focus collaboration for the @xmath6 from charm decays show that the @xmath6 mass line shape could be changed by the effects of interference from an @xmath16-wave and possible other sources .",
    "distortions of the line shape of @xmath17 have also been observed at rhic in @xmath3 and peripheral au+au collisions  @xcite .",
    "dynamical interactions with the surrounding matter  @xcite , interference between various scattering channels  @xcite , phase space distortions  @xcite , and bose - einstein correlations  @xcite are possible explanations for the apparent modification of resonance properties .",
    "resonance measurements in the presence of a dense medium can be significantly affected by two competing effects .",
    "resonances that decay before kinetic freeze - out may not be reconstructed due to the rescattering of the daughter particles . in this case , the lost efficiency in the reconstruction of the parent resonance is relevant and depends on the time between chemical and kinetic freeze - outs , the source size , the resonance phase space distribution , the resonance daughters hadronic interaction cross - sections , etc . on the other hand , after chemical freeze - out , pseudo - elastic interactions  @xcite among hadrons in the medium may increase the resonance population .",
    "this resonance regeneration depends on the cross - section of the interacting hadrons in the medium .",
    "thus , the study of resonances can provide an important probe of the time evolution of the source from chemical to kinetic freeze - outs and detailed information on hadronic interactions in the final stage .    in this paper , we study the @xmath0 vector meson with a lifetime of 4 fm/@xmath15 .",
    "the kaon and pion daughters of the @xmath18 resonance in the hadronic decay channel @xmath19 can interact with other hadrons in the medium .",
    "their rescattering effect is mainly determined by the pion - pion interaction total cross section  @xcite , which was measured to be significantly larger ( factor @xmath205 ) than the kaon - pion interaction total cross section  @xcite .",
    "the kaon - pion interaction total cross section determines the regeneration effect that produces the @xmath18 resonance  @xcite .",
    "thus , the final observable @xmath18 yields may decrease compared to the primordial yields , and a suppression of the @xmath21 yield ratio is expected in heavy - ion collisions . this @xmath18 yield decrease and the @xmath21 suppression compared to elementary collisions , such as @xmath3 , at similar collision energies",
    "can be used to roughly estimate the system time span between chemical and kinetic freeze - outs . due to the rescattering of the daughter particles ,",
    "the low @xmath7 @xmath18 resonances are less likely to escape the hadronic medium before decaying , compared to high @xmath7 @xmath18 resonances . this could alter the @xmath1 transverse mass ( @xmath22 ) spectra compared to other particles with similar masses .",
    "the in - medium effects on the resonance production can be manifested in other observables as well . in a quark coalescence scenario ,",
    "the elliptic flow ( @xmath9 ) , for non - central au+au collisions , of the @xmath18 resonances produced at chemical freeze - out might be similar to that of kaons  @xcite .",
    "however , at low @xmath7 , the @xmath18 @xmath9 may be modified by the rescattering effect discussed previously .",
    "this rescattering effect also depends on the hadron distributions in the coordinate space in the system at the final stage .",
    "thus , a measurement of the @xmath18 @xmath9 at @xmath23 gev/@xmath15 compared to the kaon @xmath9 may provide information on the shape of the fireball in the coordinate space at late stages .",
    "a study of the relation of the particle production to its intrinsic properties may reveal its production mechanism .",
    "the nuclear modification factor and @xmath9 have been observed to be different between @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , @xmath11  @xcite . in a hydrodynamic limit , the transverse momentum spectra of produced particles",
    "are only determined by the velocity field and therefore the mass of the produced particle . in a quark coalescence model ,",
    "particle production is related to its quark content . since stable mesons ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 )",
    "are usually lighter than stable baryons ( @xmath26 , @xmath11 ) , the particle type is coupled with the mass .",
    "detailed studies of @xmath18 ( and/or @xmath27 ) can be of special importance , as its mass is close to the mass of baryons ( @xmath26 , @xmath11 ) but it is a vector meson . in the intermediate @xmath7 range @xmath28 gev/@xmath15 ,",
    "identified hadron @xmath9 measurements have shown that the hadron @xmath9 follows a simple scaling of the number of constituent quarks in the hadrons : @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the number of constituent quarks of the hadron and @xmath31 is the common elliptic flow for single quarks  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the @xmath9 for the @xmath18 produced at hadronization should follow the scaling law with @xmath32 .",
    "however , for the @xmath18 regenerated through @xmath33 in the hadronic stage , @xmath9 should follow the scaling law with @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "the measured @xmath18 @xmath9 in the intermediate @xmath7 region may provide information on the @xmath18 production mechanism in the hadronic phase and reveal the particle production dynamics in general .",
    "it is inconclusive whether the difference in the nuclear modification factor between @xmath25 and @xmath11 is due to a baryon - meson effect or simply a mass effect  @xcite .",
    "we can use the unique properties of the @xmath18 to distinguish whether the nuclear modification factor @xmath35 or @xmath36 , defined later in the text ( section v.f . ) and in  @xcite and  @xcite respectively , in the intermediate @xmath7 region depends on mass or particle species ( i.e. meson / baryon ) . specifically",

    "the data used in this analysis were taken in the second rhic run ( 2001 - 2002 ) using the solenoidal tracker at rhic ( star ) with au+au and @xmath3 collisions at @xmath2 = 200 gev .",
    "the primary tracking device of the star detector is the time projection chamber ( tpc ) which is a 4.2 meter long cylinder covering a pseudo - rapidity range @xmath37 for tracking with complete azimuthal coverage ( @xmath38 )  @xcite .    in au+au collisions ,",
    "a minimum bias trigger was defined by requiring coincidences between two zero degree calorimeters which are located in the beam directions at @xmath39 mrad and measure the spectator neutrons .",
    "a central trigger corresponding to the top 10@xmath40 of the inelastic hadronic au+au cross - section was defined using both the zero degree calorimeters and the scintillating central trigger barrel , which surrounds the outer cylinder of the tpc and triggers on charged particles in the midpseudorapidity ( @xmath41 0.5 ) region . in @xmath3 collisions ,",
    "the minimum bias trigger was defined using coincidences between two beam - beam counters that measure the charged particle multiplicity in forward pseudorapidities ( 3.3 @xmath42 5.0 ) .",
    "only events with the primary vertex within @xmath4350 cm from the center of the tpc along the beam line were selected to insure uniform acceptance in the @xmath44 range studied . as a result , about 2 @xmath45 10@xmath46 top 10% central au+au , 2 @xmath45 10@xmath46 minimum bias au+au , and 6 @xmath45 10@xmath46 minimum bias @xmath3 collision events were used in this analysis . in order to study the centrality dependence of the @xmath18 production ,",
    "the events from minimum bias au+au collisions were divided into four centrality bins from the most central to the most peripheral collisions : 0 - 10% , 10 - 30% , 30 - 50% and 50 - 80% , according to the fraction of the charged hadron reference multiplicity ( defined in  @xcite ) distribution in all events .     for negative particles vs. momentum measured by the tpc in au+au collisions .",

    "charged pions and kaons can be identified with their momenta up to about 0.75 gev/@xmath15 while protons and anti - protons can be identified with momenta up to about 1.1 gev/@xmath15 . in order to quantitatively describe the particle identification , the variable @xmath48 ( e.g. pions )",
    "was defined as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the measured energy loss for a track , @xmath51 is the expected mean energy loss for charged pions with a given momentum , and @xmath52 is the @xmath47 resolution which varies between 6% and 10% from @xmath3 to central au+au events and depends on the characteristics of each track , such as the number of @xmath47 hits for a track measured in the tpc , the pseudorapidity of a track , etc .",
    "we construct @xmath53 in a similar way for the charged kaon identification .",

    "in addition , statistical model prediction of @xmath21 of 0.33@xmath430.01  @xcite is considerably larger ( in a 2@xmath67 effect ) than than our measurement of 0.23@xmath430.05 in 0 - 10% au+au .",
    "the @xmath6 regeneration depends on @xmath68 while the rescattering of the daughter particles depends on @xmath69 and @xmath70 , which are considerably larger ( factor @xmath205 ) than @xmath68 @xcite .",

    "due to the relatively long lifetime of the @xmath27 meson and the negligible @xmath71 , the rescattering of the @xmath27 decay products and the @xmath27 regeneration should be negligible .",

    "if we use the minimum bias @xmath3 measurement of the @xmath66 yield ratio as the one at chemical freeze - out and use the most central measurement of the @xmath66 yield ratio in au+au collisions for the production at kinetic freeze - out , then under the assumptions that i ) all the @xmath18s which decay before kinetic freeze - out are lost due to the rescattering effect and ii ) there s no regeneration effect , the time between chemical and kinetic freeze - outs is short and @xmath78 = 2 @xmath43 1 fm/@xmath15 .",
