    "in many multiuser wireless communications scenarios , having sufficient csit is a crucial ingredient that facilitates improved performance . while being useful , perfect csit is also hard and time - consuming to obtain , hence the need for communication schemes that can utilize partial or delayed csit knowledge ( see @xcite ) . in this context of multiuser communications ,",
    "we here consider the broadcast channel ( bc ) , and specifically focus on the two - user multiple - input single - output ( miso ) bc , where a two - antenna transmitter communicates to two single - antenna receivers . in this",
    "setting , the channel model takes the form    @xmath0    where for any time instant @xmath1 , @xmath2 represent the channel vectors for user  1 and 2 respectively , where @xmath3 represent unit power awgn noise , where @xmath4 is the input signal with power constraint @xmath5 , and where in this case , @xmath6 also takes the role of the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "it is well known that in this setting , the presence of full csit allows for the optimal @xmath7 degree - of - freedom ( dof ) per user , whereas the complete absence of csit causes a substantial degradation to just @xmath8 dof per user , the corresponding dof pair @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 the corresponding dof region is then the set of all achievable dof pairs . ] .",
    "an interesting scheme that bridges this performance gap by utilizing partial csit knowledge , was recently presented in @xcite which showed that delayed csit knowledge can still be useful in improving the dof region of the broadcast channel . in the above described two - user miso bc setting , and under the assumption that at time @xmath1 , the transmitter knows the delayed channel states ( @xmath11 ) up to time @xmath12 , the work in  @xcite showed that each user can achieve @xmath13 dof , providing a clear improvement over the case of no csit .",
    "this result was later generalized in @xcite which considered the natural extension where , in addition to the aforementioned perfect knowledge of prior csit , the transmitter also had imperfect knowledge of current csit ; at time @xmath1 the transmitter had estimates @xmath14 of @xmath15 and @xmath16 , with estimation errors @xmath17 having i.i.d .",

    "finally , in the spirit of @xcite we consider a unit coherence period , as well as perfect knowledge of channel state information at the receivers ( perfect csir ) .",
    "motivated by the fact that in multiuser settings , the quality of csit feedback may vary across different links , we extend the approach in @xcite to consider unequal quality of current csit knowledge for @xmath15 and @xmath16 . specifically under the same set of assumptions mentioned above , and in the presence of perfect prior csit , we now consider the case where at time @xmath1 , the transmitter has estimates @xmath14 of the current @xmath15 and @xmath16 , with estimation errors @xmath39 having i.i.d .",

    "we proceed to describe the optimal dof region of the general mixed - csit two - user miso bc ( two - antenna transmitter ) .",

    "another notation that will be shared between schemes includes @xmath77 that denotes the interference seen by user  1 and user  2 respectively , during timeslot @xmath1 of phase @xmath61 . for @xmath78",

    "<S> in the setting of the two - user broadcast channel , recent work by maddah - ali and tse has shown that knowledge of prior channel state information at the transmitter ( csit ) can be useful , even in the absence of any knowledge of current csit . </S>",
    "<S> very recent work by kobayashi et al . </S>",
    "<S> , yang et al . , and gou and jafar , extended this to the case where , instead of no current csit knowledge , the transmitter has partial knowledge , and where under a symmetry assumption , the quality of this knowledge is identical for the different users channels .    motivated by the fact that in multiuser settings , the quality of csit feedback may vary across different links , </S>",
    "<S> we here generalize the above results to the natural setting where the current csit quality varies for different users channels . for this setting </S>",
    "<S> we derive the optimal degrees - of - freedom ( dof ) region , and provide novel multi - phase broadcast schemes that achieve this optimal region . </S>",
    "<S> finally this generalization incorporates and generalizes the corresponding result in maleki et al . which considered the broadcast channel with one user having perfect csit and the other only having prior csit . </S>"
