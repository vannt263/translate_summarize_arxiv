    "the spectroscopy is a serious task for any model of hadron structure .",
    "it can yield a detailed information on the source of hyperfine interaction , as well as on effective degrees of freedom in the description of hadron dynamics .",
    "the so - called `` three - body spin - orbit puzzle '' has a long history . in the original papers of isgur and karl @xcite",
    "it was shown that the whole su(3 ) baryon spectrum can be reproduced qualitatively and ( with some restrictions ) quantitatively in a constituent quark model based on a non - relativistic hamiltonian with a central confining potential plus effective color - magnetic one - gluon exchange ( oge ) forces .",
    "the hyperfine interaction was assumed to be a sum of the spin - spin , tensor and spin - orbit interaction potentials between the constituent quarks . however , the spin - orbit term yields a very large ( of order 500 mev ) matrix elements in the three - body system ( typical baryons ) , while in mesons and meson - like baryons @xcite the matrix elements are small as a result of the strong cancelation between the dynamical one - gluon exchange spin - orbit forces and a pure kinematical spin - orbit forces due - to the thomas precession of the quark spin in the central confining potential .",
    "contrary , in ordinary baryons ( like @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) , there are not enough cancelation effects between the two origin spin - orbit forces . showing these possibilities and assuming that in baryons like in mesons must be a consistent cancelation , isgur and karl , as a first approximation , excluded all spin - orbit forces from the hyperfine interaction potential .",
    "since the beginning the problem was called a `` three body spin - orbit puzzle '' in baryons and up to now it was not resolved in a consistent way , although in the relativized version of the constituent quark models ( see @xcite ) some reduction of the size of the spin - orbit interactions to acceptable levels was obtained .",
    "there are other strong candidates for the hyperfine interaction in baryons such as goldstone - boson exchange ( gbe ) forces @xcite and the instanton induced exchange forces ( iie ) @xcite . the gbe based constituent quark model was proposed as a realization of the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry of qcd , which plays a crucial role for the hadron structure .",
    "the debates between the oge and gbe based quark models over the last decade @xcite were focused on the `` three - body spin - orbit puzzle '' , as well as the level ordering problem and the mixing angles in excited baryon sector .",
    "while reproducing the correct level ordering ( for example @xmath5 - @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) , the gbe based model does not contain spin - orbit terms .",
    "the main issue of these debates likely supports the idea that the origin of hyperfine interaction between valence quarks is a sum of the gbe and oge forces ( and possible two - pion exchange @xcite , and additionally iie forces for the nucleon sector ) in consistence with the theory of the low - energy nn - interaction @xcite .",
    "the question is , however , how much the each exchange mechanism does contribute to the baryon spectrum ?",
    "the solving of this complex problem requires many efforts to be done both theoretically and experimentally .    on the other hand , from the beginning of the proton spin crisis",
    "@xcite it became clear that the non - relativistic constituent quark models are not adequate and complete picture for the hadron structure , since only about 30 percent of the proton spin is described by the valence quarks !",
    "the possible contribution comes from the coupling to the lower component of the dirac spinor , one - gluon exchange and pion cloud effects .",
    "the problem can be resolved in the frame of the cloudy bag model ( cbm ) @xcite , as was claimed in the recent papers @xcite . a relativistic picture of the hadron structure , while playing a decisive role for the understanding of the proton spin crisis ,",
    "also should yield a consistent description of the hadron spectrum including excited baryons .",
    "the questions , concerning the source of the hyperfine splitting in baryons , the relativistic structure of the one - meson and one - gluon exchange mechanisms , the role of the lower component of the dirac spinor of valence quarks and the contribution of the sea - quarks to baryon spectrum are still being open ! the use of the bag models in baryon spectroscopy was restricted to the octet and decuplet baryons @xcite while having some specific problems concerning the convergence of the self - energy and the sharp surface pion - quark coupling .",
    "the recent progress in the frame of the chiral quark - meson coupling model ( cqmcm)@xcite was done for the description of the n and @xmath0 spectrum and the nuclear matter with inclusion both gluon and meson one - loop diagrams while restricting the intermediate baryon states to the lowest mode when considering the self - energy diagrams .    the aim of present paper is to show that a description of the baryon structure in a field - theoretical based chiral quark model @xcite can open many windows to the long - standing problems of excited baryon spectroscopy . in the last work we have calculated the lower excitation spectrum of the su(2 ) baryons on the basis of one pion - loop diagrams .",
    "further we will show that relativistic one - meson and color - magnetic one - gluon exchange forces between valence quarks generate spin 0 , spin 1 , spin 2 etc .",
    "operators , which can be considered as analogy of the non - relativistic spin - spin , spin - orbit , tensor etc .",
    "operators , respectively .",
    "however , all these relativistic operators couple the upper and the lower dirac components of the two interacting valence quarks , hence have a strongly different nature .",
    "for instance , the two valence quarks in s - waves , interacting via one - gluon or one pion exchange forces are coupled only by the spin 1 operators ( the analogy of the spin - orbit forces ) , while in the non - relativistic models the corresponding terms have a spin - spin structure , i.e. are spin 0 operators .",
    "this finding has an important consequence for the proton spin problem , since the possible contribution to the proton spin comes not only from one - gluon exchange , but also from one - meson exchange mechanism .",
    "additionally , in recent paper @xcite meson - cloud effects were shown to be important for the description of the flavor asymmetry of the nucleon sea .",
    "we will show in a phenomenological way that a reasonable description of the lower excitation spectrum of the @xmath3 and @xmath8 can be obtained in a relativistic chiral quark model , including all second - order corrections induced by pion fields ( corresponding to the self energy and exchange diagrams ) to the zeroth - order quark - core results with further possible improvement by including the two - pion exchange and iie ( for the nucleon sector ) forces .",
    "it will be shown also that the contribution of the color - electric ( coulomb ) component of the gluon fields to the baryon spectrum is enormously large at reasonable values of the strong coupling constant . to have an acceptable contribution of the gluon one - loop diagrams one needs a small value of the strong coupling constant which results the gluon - exchange contribution to the nucleon-@xmath0 mass splitting to be negligible .",
    "this result confirm the prediction of the non - relativistic constituent quark model @xcite , that the one - gluon exchange mechanism does not play an important role in the description of the su(2 ) baryon spectrum .",
    "we will show also that the restriction of the intermediate baryon states to the lowest mode when calculating the contributions of the self - energy diagrams is not a good approximation and in order to have convergent results , one has to include all intermediate excited quark and antiquark states with the total angular momentum up to j=25/2 .",
    "the relativistic quark model is based on an effective chiral lagrangian describing quarks as relativistic fermions moving in a confining static potential .",
    "the modification of the model , the so - called perturbative chiral quark model recently was applied to the ground- state baryon masses @xcite .",
    "the potential is described by a lorentz scalar and the time component of a vector potential , where the latter term is responsible for short - range fluctuations of the gluon field configurations @xcite .",
    "the model potential defines unperturbed wave functions of the quarks which are subsequently used in the calculations of baryon properties .",
    "the baryons are considered as bound states of valence quarks , surrounded by a pion cloud as required by the chiral symmetry and by gluons .",
    "interaction of quarks with a pion is introduced on the basis of the linearized @xmath9-model @xcite .",
    "the residual color - magnetic quark - gluon interaction is introduced on the field - theoretical basis as prescribed by qcd .",

    "we note that the relativistic one - pion and one - gluon ( color - magnetic ) exchange forces have strongly different structure from corresponding non - relativistic exchange forces : the exchanged pion or gluon in the @xmath130-orbit couple the upper ( lower ) component of i - valence quark with the lower ( upper ) component of another j - valence quark ( see above equations ) and generate spin 0 , 1 , 2 , etc .",

    "n and @xmath0 comes from the pion exchange and gluon exchange ( color - magnetic part ) via the spin 1 operator ( an analog of the spin - orbit operator ) , while in the non - relativistic case the corresponding terms are spin 0 ( spin - spin ) operators .",
    "another important point is that the both exchange operators are symmetric under the permutation of the upper and the lower components of the interacting valence quarks in i- and j - orbits .",
    "this fact indicates the chiral invariance of the lagrangian in the matrix elements level .",

    "in table 1 we indicate the model parameters together with the corresponding single - quark energies for the models @xmath138 and @xmath139 . by examining the two model parameters we can check the sensitivity of the baryon spectrum on the description of the static properties of the proton .",
    "table 2 contains the quark core results @xcite for the static properties of the proton with the correction on the center of mass motion ( cm ) .",
    "one can note from the table that a larger value of the strength parameter @xmath134 ( model @xmath139 ) of the confining potential yields a smaller value for the proton rms radius .",
    "further we will see that the calculated spectrum is quite sensitive on the choice of the the strength parameter , hence on the proton rms radius .    in table 3",
    "we give the perturbative corrections to the valence quarks energy shifts in the @xmath140 orbits from the self - energy diagrams induced by pion and gluon fields .",
    "contributions from intermediate quark and anti - quark states are included with the full momentum up to @xmath1 which enables convergent results opposite to the bag models ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the columns with @xmath141 corresponds to the special cases where an intermediate quark is in the same orbit as the initial and final quark .",
    "these cases are useful to check the limitation of the self energy in the literature with the intermediate ground state of the baryon .",
    "as one can note from the table , the self - energy results with the restriction @xmath141 are negative for the both pion and gluon ( color - magnetic part ) fields , while are positive without the restriction ( due to the intermediate anti - quark states ) .",
    "thus the restriction @xmath141 decreases the baryon energy contrary to the complete sum of intermediate quark and anti - quark states .",
    "the contributions of the exchange diagrams to the energy - shift of the lower su(2 ) baryon states are given in tables 4 and 5 . as was pointed out above , the relativistic structures of the pion and gluon exchange mechanisms are different from the corresponding non - relativistic operators . in first case",
    "the both pion and gluon exchange operators couple the upper ( lower ) and lower ( upper ) dirac components of the two interacting valence quarks .",
    "one can see from table 4 that in the ground and radially excited states of the @xmath142 and @xmath0 where all three valence quarks are in the @xmath143-orbits , the exchanged pion or gluon can be only in the @xmath144 orbit , i.e. generate spin 1 operators ( analogy of the spin - orbit operator ) .",
    "these operators , naturally , can contribute to the proton spin like the lower component ( p - wave ) of the dirac wave function . the non - relativistic pion- and gluon - exchange operators between valence quarks in the ground state have a spin - spin structure , i.e. are spin 0 operators and as a result do not contribute to the proton spin . for the baryon states with the last excited quark in the @xmath145-orbit , the contribution comes from the both @xmath146 ( spin - spin ) and @xmath144 ( spin - orbit ) terms . for baryons with a structure",
    "@xmath147 the corresponding exchange forces generate the @xmath144 ( spin - orbit ) and @xmath148 ( tensor ) operators . from the table 5",
    "one can note that the color - electric forces yield large spin - independent and small spin - dependent matrix elements . in the case when the intermediate quark states are restricted to the ground state in the @xmath149 and @xmath150 , the color - electric component of the gluon - cloud contribution is exactly canceled by the corresponding exchange term in consistence with the mit bag - model result .",
    "the analysis of the results presented for the excited baryon states with the structure @xmath151 and @xmath152 indicates that the spin - orbit matrix elements generated by the both pion- and gluon - exchange ( color - magnetic ) forces are of acceptable order contrary to the non - relativistic one - gluon exchange spin - orbit matrix elements @xcite .    in table 6",
    "we give the mass values for the g.s .",
    "n(939 ) with and without cm correction for the both model a and b. the restriction to the intermediate ground state when estimating the self - energy ( i=0 ) yields too small values for the nucleon energy ( and also for other baryons ) .",
    "contrary , the inclusion of all excited intermediate states results large mass values .",
    "model b yields even larger value for the mass of the nucleon .",
    "this means that larger values of the strength parameter @xmath134 of the confining potential is not likely .",
    "another important point is that the inclusion of the gluon - exchange and self - energy diagrams do not improve the situation . for the model a",
    ", the contribution of the pion fields to the @xmath149 is about 200 mev , while the gluon fields yield more than 500 mev shift with the strong coupling constant @xmath2 .",
    "one can note that the three methods for the correction of center of mass motion agree within 50 mev which seems too large .",
    "however , these three methods always give corrections with systematic differences .",
    "for example , the lho method yields correction larger than the @xmath56 method , but smaller than the @xmath55 method .",
    "thus , we can fix one of these methods and go to the excited sector .    and",
    "finally in last table 7 we compare the theoretical energy values including the cm correction in the lho method with experimental data from pdg @xcite .",
    "we assume that the lower negative parity excited n and @xmath0 states correspond to the excited last valence quark in the @xmath153-orbit , while the radially excited nucleon @xmath154 ( roper ) and delta @xmath155 resonances are assigned with the radially ( in 2s - state ) excited valence quark .",
    "we note , that one can recalculate the whole gluon - loop corrections to the su(2 ) baryon spectrum by changing the value of the strong coupling constant ( we use @xmath2 ) in order to have smaller contribution to the mass - shift values .",
    "however , this way yields smaller values for the splittings between su(2 ) baryon states .",
    "the situation is not helpful for the @xmath156 splitting , since we have only 63 mev with the above value of the strong coupling constant .",
    "thus , we come to the conclusion that the gluon field corrections to the mass - shift values of the su(2 ) baryon states must be small and confirm the results of the non - relativistic cqm results @xcite .    when ignoring the gluon loop corrections , we have an overall good description of the su(2 ) baryon spectrum . the nucleon g.s . and the roper resonance @xmath157 are overestimated by more than 200 mev , while the orbital excitations of the nucleon , @xmath158 and @xmath159 are slightly underestimated by about 40 - 60 mev .",
    "the situation in the delta sector is quite different . unlike the nucleon sector , the @xmath160 resonance and it s first radial excitation @xmath161",
    "are overestimated slightly by 50 - 90 mev in the model a. but , the orbitally excited delta resonances @xmath162 and @xmath163 are also underestimated by small values ( like the nucleon sector ) .    in order to check whether the gluon field contributions can be replaced by the multiple pion exchange mechanism , we repeat the calculations of the ground state nucleon and @xmath160 with smaller and larger values of the pion decay constant . for the @xmath164 1.5 @xmath165 we obtained @xmath166 mev and @xmath1671118 mev which have to be compared with the numbers 1166 mev and 1310 mev from the table 7 , respectively . for the value",
    "@xmath164 0.5 @xmath165 we have @xmath168 mev and @xmath1672342 mev , which are very large comparing the corresponding estimations calculated with the experimental pion decay constant @xmath165 .",
    "the different level of the estimations for the nucleon and delta sectors indicates on the necessity of the strong instanton induced exchange mechanism , which does not change the delta spectrum , while effecting the nucleons essentially .",
    "additionally , the two - pion loop corrections are needed for the both sector , which would yield small corrections .",
    "we have developed a relativistic chiral quark model with the inclusion of the gluon and pion fields contribution to the mass spectrum of the su(2 ) baryons .",
    "these fields were shown to generate the second - order self - energy and exchange corrections .",
    "the overall good description of the lower excitation spectrum of the @xmath142 and @xmath0 states are obtained when restricting to the pion fields corrections .",
    "the color - electric components of the gluon fields give enormously large contributions to the baryon spectrum ( about 500 mev with @xmath2 for the nucleon g.s . ) .",
    "the exchanged pion or gluon ( color - magnetic component ) generates the spin 0 ( spin - spin ) , spin 1 ( spin - orbit ) and spin 2 ( tensor ) operators with reasonable values of the matrix elements for the su(2 ) baryons energy shifts , thus indicating no any `` spin - orbit problem '' in the excited nucleon and delta sectors . the only contribution to the g.s .",
    "nucleon and delta comes from the spin 1 ( spin - orbit ) operator which can contribute also to the baryon spin .",
    "when using a small value of the strong coupling constant or completely ignoring the gluon loop corrections , the model yields a quite good description of the delta resonances mass - spectrum within 50 - 60 mev .",
    "however , the calculated nucleon sector differs from the experimental values essentially .    in conclusion",
    ", the developed model still needs an additional mechanism for the description of the excited nucleon and @xmath0 spectrum .",
