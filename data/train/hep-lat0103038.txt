    "four - quark operators give rise to higher - twist contributions ( cats - ear diagram ) .",
    "while this has been known for many years @xcite , the size of these contributions is still uncertain .",
    "because the structure function @xmath1 of the proton is one of the best measured hadronic quantities , the natural idea would be to extract the higher - twist contribution from the @xmath2 dependence of @xmath3 .",
    "this has , however , proven to be a difficult task ( for a recent attempt see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "a computation of higher - twist effects from first principles is possible by means of monte carlo simulations of lattice qcd , and first estimates using this method in the case of the pion became available recently @xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall extend our previous work to the case of the nucleon .    by means of the ope @xmath1 can be expressed through forward nucleon matrix elements of local operators . in the deep inelastic limit @xmath4",
    "it is dominated by the leading twist - two contributions .",
    "these have been the subject of intensive studies in the past .",
    "the next - to - leading contributions have twist four and are suppressed by one power of @xmath5 .",
    "more precisely , the ope relates ( nachtmann ) moments @xcite @xmath6 , which take into account the effects of the finite proton mass @xmath7 , to the product of wilson coefficients and hadronic matrix elements .",
    "schematically one finds for @xmath8 @xmath9 / ( n+2)(n+3 )    \\nonumber \\\\       & = & c^{(2)}_n(q^2/\\mu^2,g(\\mu ) ) a^{(2)}_n ( \\mu )      + \\frac{c^{(4)}_n(q^2/\\mu^2,g(\\mu))}{q^2 } a^{(4)}_n ( \\mu )      + o \\left(\\frac{1}{q^4}\\right ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath10 .",

    "the four - quark operators we are interested in have twist four and higher . in particular , the twist - four , spin - two matrix element @xmath18 is given by ( indices in @xmath19 are symmetrised ) @xmath20 with the four - quark operator @xmath21 ( using the nomenclature introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the quark field @xmath22 carries flavour , colour , and dirac indices , the matrices @xmath23 are the usual generators of colour su(3)@xmath24 , and for two flavours the flavour matrix @xmath25 reads @xmath26 in terms of the quark charges @xmath27",
    ". the proton states with momentum @xmath28 and spin vector @xmath29 are normalised such that @xmath30 the wilson coefficient reads  @xcite @xmath31 .",
    "these expressions are to be compared with their twist - two counterparts : @xmath32 with the operator @xmath33 and the wilson coefficient @xmath34 .",
    "the operators ( [ opt4 ] ) and ( [ opt2 ] ) transform identically under lorentz transformations , but ( [ opt4 ] ) has dimension six , whereas ( [ opt2 ] ) has only dimension four : four - quark operators will in general mix with two - quark operators of lower dimension .",
    "this fact complicates the investigation of four - quark operators , because the mixing with lower - dimensional operators can not be calculated reliably within perturbation theory .",
    "a nonperturbative computation in lattice qcd could proceed along the same lines as in the case of the twist - three matrix element @xmath35 @xcite . for the time being , we do not attempt such a nonperturbative calculation of the renormalisation and mixing coefficients of four - quark operators . instead we restrict ourselves to cases where mixing with lower - dimensional operators is prohibited by flavour symmetry .",
    "we shall present results obtained in the quenched approximation of lattice qcd with wilson fermions .",
    "a preliminary account of some of these results has already been given in ref .",
    "since the lattice formulation of gauge theories requires an analytic continuation from minkowski space to euclidean space , we now switch to the euclidean formulation .",
    "in particular , all operators will be written down in euclidean space , unless otherwise noted .",
    "in our previous publication @xcite we have studied four - quark operators in the pion . in this case",
    "we could avoid mixing with lower - dimensional operators by working with operators which carry isospin @xmath36 .",
    "obviously , operators with @xmath36 vanish in the proton .",
    "therefore we enlarge the flavour symmetry group from su(2)@xmath37 to su(3)@xmath37 assuming three quarks of the same mass .",
    "correspondingly , we then have @xmath38 and the flavour structure of the operator in the ope is now @xmath39 while two - quark operators transform under su(3)@xmath37 according to @xmath40 , we have for four - quark operators : @xmath41 . four - quark operators with @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and hypercharge @xmath44 belonging to the multiplets @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 do not mix with two - quark operators and do not automatically vanish in a proton expectation value .",

    "eckart theorem tells us that the proton matrix elements of these two operators are proportional to each other : @xmath51 furthermore , the wigner  eckart theorem relates proton matrix elements to neutron matrix elements .",
    "thus our results can easily be rephrased in terms of neutron expectation values .",
    "however , unless otherwise stated , we shall only present the proton results .    the operators belonging to the multiplets @xmath52 and @xmath53 read @xmath54 @xmath55 being antisymmetric with respect to the interchange of the two quark - antiquark pairs they do not appear in the flavour decomposition of the ope operator ( [ ope_op ] ) .",
    "in the following we present monte carlo data from quenched simulations at @xmath56 with wilson fermions on a @xmath57 lattice . we have performed simulations at three different values of the hopping parameter @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 and we have collected about 300 configurations .",
    "the statistical errors have been determined by the jackknife method .",
    "the proton matrix elements are computed in the standard fashion from ratios of three - point functions , @xmath61 , to two - point functions , @xmath62 , with the interpolating fields @xmath63 and @xmath64 of ref .",
    "@xcite . for @xmath65",
    "this ratio should be independent of @xmath12 : @xmath66 if we vary @xmath12 keeping @xmath67 fixed we should therefore find a region where @xmath68 is constant , i.e.  shows a plateau .",
    "an example of such a plateau is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.plat ] .",
    "we have always chosen @xmath69 and the spatial components of the proton momentum have been set to zero .",
    "the ratio @xmath68 equals the matrix element in the lattice normalisation of states and fields . in order to obtain the fields in the continuum normalisation we have to multiply each quark field by @xmath70 . to normalise the states according to eq .",
    "( [ normal ] ) we must multiply @xmath68 by an additional factor of @xmath71 .",
    "we determine the matrix elements by fitting the ratio @xmath68 to a constant in the region @xmath72 .    for a general four - quark operator",
    "the three - point function @xmath61 consists of three types of contributions , which can be represented pictorially by the following diagrams    fd1    ( 60,40 )    fd2    ( 60,40 )     +    fd3    ( 60,40 )    it is precisely through contributions of the form of the first two diagrams that the mixing with lower - dimensional operators occurs .",
    "therefore these contributions cancel in the operators which we consider , and we are left with the contributions of the last type only . for proton matrix elements only some terms of the operators contribute , e.g. the @xmath73 terms vanish as those containing @xmath74 quarks .",
    "therefore the expectation values of the operators ( [ op27 ] ) , ( [ op10 ] ) , ( [ op10bar ] ) reduce to @xmath75    at each @xmath76 value the matrix elements are made dimensionless by dividing them by the corresponding value of @xmath77 . as the bare quark mass is given by @xmath78",

    "( [ opt4 ] ) . in order to access the flavour-@xmath85 component experimentally",
    "one has to combine the structure functions of several baryons ( @xmath86 , @xmath13 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 ) in such a way as to project out the desired flavour combination , e.g. @xmath90 unfortunately most of these terms will not be measured in the foreseeable future .",
    "so a direct comparison with data is out of question . on the other hand",
    ", they can be used as a testing ground for models of hadrons , taking the role of experimental data .",
    "note that the @xmath85 contribution can also be isolated by studying combinations of electromagnetic and weak structure functions @xcite .    of course",
    ", we need to know the renormalised operators .",
    "although due to our choice of the flavour-@xmath85 component mixing with two - quark operators is absent , different four - quark operators may still mix under renormalisation .",

    "e.g.  the number shown for the operator @xmath92 in table  [ tab : op27s2 ] is what we obtain for @xmath93 in the chiral limit .",
    "we have checked that these operators fulfil their fierz identities .",
    ".matrix elements of the spin - two operators from the @xmath85 multiplet , divided by @xmath77 and extrapolated to the chiral limit .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     for the operators in the @xmath94 of colour the absolute values for the spin - one diquarks are considerably larger than for the spin - zero diquarks . for the single operator in the @xmath95 of colour the difference is less pronounced .",
    "this pattern can tentatively be understood in a non - relativistic quark picture .",
    "when the diquark is in the @xmath94 of su(3)@xmath24 it is anti - symmetric in the colour indices , and therefore the symmetric ( in the spin indices ) spin - one state is favoured over the anti - symmetric spin - one state . on the other hand ,",
    "when the diquark is in the ( symmetric ) @xmath95 of colour one might at first sight expect the anti - symmetric spin - zero state to dominate over the symmetric spin - one state .",
    "although the spin - zero contribution is indeed less suppressed than in the @xmath94 case it is not really dominating .",
    "this is probably related to the fact that a diquark in the @xmath95 of su(3)@xmath24 must be accompanied by ( at least ) one gluon if it is to form a colour singlet with the remaining quark .",
    "the coupling to the gluon , mixing `` large '' and `` small '' components of the quark spinors , would invalidate the above arguments which worked reasonably well for diquarks in the @xmath94 of colour .    of course , the operators from the @xmath96 and @xmath97 multiplets can also rewritten in diquark form .",
    "they then appear as linear combinations of operators in which the diquark is either in a @xmath94 of su(3)@xmath24 or in a @xmath98 .",
    "the fact that the matrix elements in table  [ t3 ] for the colour structures @xmath99 and @xmath100 have opposite signs translates into a suppression of the @xmath98 diquarks relative to the @xmath94 diquarks .",
    "this is in accord with our observations made above in the case of the operators from the @xmath85 multiplet .",
    "in this paper we have computed the expectation values of a variety of four - quark operators in the proton by means of quenched monte carlo simulations .",
    "since it is rather difficult to treat the mixing with lower - dimensional operators correctly , we have restricted ourselves to operators whose flavour structure forbids this kind of mixing . the additional requirement that the operators should not automatically vanish in the nucleon led us to consider the flavour group su(3)@xmath37 and to choose operators from the @xmath101 , @xmath52 , and @xmath102 representations .",
    "one of the operators from the @xmath101 is responsible for the twist - four contribution to the lowest moment of @xmath3 in a somewhat exotic flavour channel .",
    "we find a rather small value for this contribution .",
    "this observation disfavours large higher - twist effects in general , although we can not exclude , of course , that our result is due to strong cancellations between different flavour contributions .    still , and with all due caution ,",
    "our findings fit into a general trend emerging from various pieces of information on higher - twist contributions to moments of nucleon structure functions : the natural energy scale for the corresponding correlators lies well below the nucleon mass leading to small numerical coefficients when the matrix elements are expressed as multiples of @xmath103 .    thus we arrive for the nucleon at a conclusion which is similar to what we observed in the pion @xcite . for a more detailed comparison we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig.comp ] the renormalised pion matrix elements @xcite with the flavour structure @xmath104 together with the corresponding renormalised matrix elements for the proton @xmath105 ( in lattice units ) .",
    "we display the results for the spin - two components setting @xmath106 ( with the trace term subtracted ) .",
    "the normalisation of the operators is chosen such that the flavour structure @xmath107 appears with the factor 1 in both cases .",
    "( alternatively , it may be remarked that su(3)@xmath37 makes the above pion matrix element equal to the expectation value of @xmath108 in the meson - octet analogue of the proton , the @xmath109 . )",
    "it is no great surprise that the numbers do not show many similarities ",
    "after all , the pion and the proton are very different particles .",
    "four - quark operators in the @xmath52 and @xmath102 representations do not lead to much larger matrix elements than the @xmath101 operators , although quite a few of those which we studied give clean signals . in the @xmath101 sector , a rewriting of our operators in terms of diquarks reveals a structure which lends itself to an interpretation with the help of quark model ideas : diquarks in the @xmath110 of su(3)@xmath24 have preferably spin one .",
    "diquarks in the @xmath95 of su(3)@xmath24 , on the other hand , do not fit so well into a nonrelativistic picture .",
    "higher - twist effects will challenge lattice qcd for a few more years .",
    "our investigations show that four - quark operators can give reasonable signals in present quenched monte carlo simulations .",
    "but the study of physically more interesting flavour channels and further twist - four operators remains an open problem whose solution requires progress in nonperturbative renormalisation , especially in the treatment of mixing with operators of lower dimension .",
