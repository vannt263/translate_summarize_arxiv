    "the research on the striking universality properties of slow relaxation dynamics has been driving great efforts in the last decades .",
    "a large and growing literature can be found in which non - exponential behaviour has been observed for correlation functions : supercooled colloidal systems  @xcite , glasses and granular material  @xcite , liquid crystal polymers  @xcite , hydrated proteins  @xcite , growth  @xcite , plasmas  @xcite and disordered vortex lattices in superconductors  @xcite are just a few examples .",
    "those systems present features which are similar to those found in systems with anomalous diffusion .",
    "the attempt to obtain response functions which are able to explain such relaxation processes is a subject more than a hundred years old .",
    "rudolph kohlrausch used stretched exponentials @xmath0 $ ] with @xmath1 to describe charge relaxation in a leyden gas  @xcite .",
    "later on , his son , friedrich kohlrausch  @xcite observed two distinct universalities : the stretched exponential with @xmath2 , and the power law behaviour . the former behaviour is now known as the kohlrausch - williams - watts ( kww ) stretched exponential .",
    "there are now two main methods to describe those relaxations : a fractional derivatives approach  @xcite , and a recurrence method applied to the mori equation  @xcite .",
    "however , new methods appear every day and we should mention here the attempt of chamberlin  @xcite to explain this universal behaviour , the diffusive method of perez - madrid  @xcite , and the new method recently proposed by schwartz and edwards  @xcite for non - linear fields .    in this work",
    ", we present an alternative way to obtain the correlation function and a result which is general as long as the diffusive processes can be described by a generalized langevin equation ( gle ) .",
    "we derive a correlation function which is an even function of time .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour is similar to those obtained using fractional derivatives .",
    "however , for short times , our method can lead to richer behaviours .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first , we give the outline of the problem of a system governed by a gle and show the connection to diffusion ; we then continue by defining in a clear manner the noise , memory and correlation functions .",
    "we construct the memory function from the fluctuation - dissipation theorem using a coloured noise , from a given density of states .",
    "after that , we discuss normal and anomalous diffusions . finally , we analyze the difference between markovian and non - markovian behaviours .",
    "we shall start by writing the gle for an operator @xmath3 @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a stochastic noise subject to the conditions @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 here , the angular brackets denote an ensemble average .",
    "some correlation functions depend on two times , being consequently non - stationary  @xcite .",
    "equation  ( [ fdt ] ) is the kubo fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt )  @xcite .",
    "the fdt can be violated in many slow relaxation processes  @xcite . before continuing ,",
    "it is important to stress the connection between the generalized langevin equation for a given operator @xmath3 and diffusion . to do this",
    ", we define the variable @xmath9 now , we can study the asymptotic behaviour of its second moment @xmath10 to characterize the type of diffusion presented by the system : for @xmath11 , we have normal diffusion , and for @xmath12 , subdiffusion ( superdiffusion ) .",
    "the memory kernel @xmath13 indicates that the motion is non - markovian ; when @xmath14 , eq .",
    "( [ gle ] ) becomes the usual langevin equation .",
    "our main interest is to discuss the behaviour of the correlation function@xmath15 from which we can describe most of the processes of interest , including relaxation .",
    "we use the above conditions for the noise to obtain a self - consistent equation for @xmath16 @xmath17    if we then apply the laplace transform ( denoted by a tilde ) to eq .",
    "( [ self_consistent ] ) , we get @xmath18 from the analysis of this equation , it is possible to obtain plenty of information concerning the asymptotic behaviour of the system . in order to make progress ,",
    "we need to make some assumptions about the origin of the memory . the direct way is to connect the random force , @xmath5 , to a thermal bath composed of harmonic oscillators  @xcite .",
    "therefore , for a system in contact with a heat reservoir ( canonical ) , the memory becomes @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the noise density of states .",
    "the memory is clearly even for any noise distribution .",
    "we shall use a coloured noise given by a generalization of the debye spectrum@xmath21 with @xmath22 as a debye cutoff frequency .",
    "the motivation for considering such cases arises from previous studies  @xcite in which it was proved that if @xmath23 as @xmath24 , then the diffusion exponent is given by @xmath25",
    "in order to obtain @xmath16 , we state that its derivative must vanish at the origin , due to eq .",
    "( [ self_consistent ] ) ; therefore , the correlation function can be neither an exponential nor a stretched exponential .",
    "the analytical continuation of the laplace transform of an even function is an odd function , and vice - versa . from eq .",
    "( [ laplace_r ] ) , we see that @xmath26 is odd , because @xmath27 is even ( see eq .",
    "( [ memory ] ) ) . following the same line of thought",
    ", we arrive at the conclusion that @xmath16 is even .",
    "lee  @xcite has also shown that both the memory and the correlation function must be even functions for any hamiltonian system .",
    "consequently , we can write    @xmath28    with @xmath29 and , @xmath30 we replace those , eqs .",

    "( [ self_consistent ] ) to obtain the following recurrence relation @xmath31!\\,\\omega _ { s}^{2l}}{(2l+1+\\nu ) } a_{n-1-l},\\ ] ] which displays a complex behaviour , where every order depends on all previous ones .",
    "this is not a surprise for a non - markovian system and it is very useful to have it made explicit in a power series .",
    "the power series defined by eq .",
    "( [ r2 ] ) is convergent : it is straightforward to prove by induction that @xmath32 . besides that , it is easy to show that the absolute values of @xmath33 decrease for @xmath34 , for a certain @xmath35 . consequently , since eq .",
    "( [ r2 ] ) is an alternating series , and @xmath36 , it is possible to conclude that it converges  @xcite for every value of @xmath37 . by playing with the parameters @xmath38 , @xmath22 , and @xmath39 , it is possible to generate a large number of functions .",
    "before we analyze anomalous diffusion , it is very useful to give a more detailed description of normal diffusion . if one takes eq .",
    "( [ noise_dos ] ) with @xmath40 and @xmath22 finite , diffusion is normal , despite the noise being coloured . using this noise in eq .",
    "( [ memory ] ) , we get @xmath41 . applying the laplace",
    "transform yields @xmath42 .",
    "it is interesting to note that this memory function is realized in electron gas models  @xcite .",
    "we now show that it is possible to find at least three time scales for this memory .",
    "the first one is the short time scale , given by @xmath43 . in the short time scale , given by @xmath44 , the first term in the expansion , eq .",
    "( [ r2 ] ) , gives @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "for this particular case , @xmath47 introduces the intermediate time scale @xmath48 . in the long time scale , @xmath49 , or , equivalently , @xmath50 , then @xmath51 . therefore , from eq .",
    "( [ laplace_r ] ) , we obtain @xmath52 , with @xmath53 . this result is the same as the one obtained from the normal langevin equation , which can be obtained from the limiting case @xmath54 .     for normal diffusion ( @xmath55 ) . here , @xmath56 and @xmath57 and @xmath58 , for curves @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",

    "curve @xmath70 is the plot of the function @xmath62 .",
    "it is clear that curve @xmath68 is not an exponential ; however , in many practical situations it is fine to approximate curve @xmath69 by an exponential for times larger than @xmath71 . for short times , @xmath72 , eq .",
    "( [ r3 ] ) is the solution and we disregard the exponential as the solution in both cases .",
    "the inset shows the correlation function @xmath16 near the origin for @xmath73 .",
    "together with curve @xmath69 and @xmath70 , we plot @xmath74 . in short ,",
    "`` good exponentials '' , such as curve @xmath70 can not exist as a solution in this case .",
    "in many experimental situations , the ratio @xmath75 can be very large .",
    "nevertheless , we propose that there will always be a short time behaviour which permits distinction from an exponential .",
    "even if the distinction is not accessible to the experimental probe , it is very important to bear in mind that the correlation function is even .",
    "for @xmath76 and @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 from top to bottom .",
    "notice the transition from a stretched exponential behaviour to a power law.,width=245 ]    now let us return to the general memory . by substituting eq .",
    "( [ noise_dos ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ memory ] ) with @xmath80 and calculating the laplace transform , we get    @xmath81    here , @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the lerch transcendent  @xcite . this function has been found most useful in certain quantum statistics  @xcite .",
    "this memory function has an asymptotic behaviour of the following form @xmath84 where @xmath85 this cutoff shows that the exponent @xmath86 , eq .",
    "( [ diff_exponent ] ) , can not be larger than @xmath87 ( ballistic motion ) .",
    "recent results  @xcite confirm that cutoff ; they obtain @xmath88 when @xmath89 .    by inverse transforming eq .",
    "( [ laplace_r ] ) , using eq .",
    "( [ limga ] ) , we get @xmath90 which is a useful approximation for @xmath91 . here",
    "@xmath92 is the mittag - leffler function  @xcite .",
    "this function behaves as a stretched exponential for short times and as an inverse power law in the long time regime ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . due to the asymptotic power - law behaviour @xmath93^{-1},\\ ] ] for @xmath94",
    ", we obtain an infinite diffusion constant @xmath95 , which is a sign of superdiffusion  @xcite .",
    "the power law exponent @xmath96 is in the interval @xmath97 as observed long ago by friedrich kohlrausch . for @xmath98 ,",
    "the mittag - leffler function is the usual exponential and @xmath99 is the relaxation time .",
    "the limiting cases correspond to @xmath88 and @xmath100 ; for these values , we have @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively .",
    "this last case corresponds to the limit of subdiffusion , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath103 .",
    "since the argument of the function is negative , the mittag - leffler function is in this case a cosine . for short times , @xmath104 the first term in the expansion gives a result identical to eq .",
    "( [ r3 ] ) , with @xmath105 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we display the correlation function @xmath16 as a function of t for anomalous diffusion , obtained from the numerical integration of eq .",
    "( [ self_consistent ] ) .",
    "we select broadband noise with @xmath76 . from top to bottom , @xmath106 and @xmath79 .",
    "we notice the transition from stretched exponential to power law behaviour .",
    "note as well that as the behaviour becomes more anomalous , _",
    "i.e. _ as @xmath38 increases , the relaxation becomes slower .",
    "recently some experimental situations have been found where non - markovian processes display markovian behaviour after a long time . in particular , we call attention to the experiments of merikoski _ et al . _ about flame evolution  @xcite .",
    "we show now that this transition is possible for normal diffusion . for large @xmath65 , eq .",
    "( [ self_consistent ] ) can be written as @xmath107 we can justify this approximation by the following arguments : if @xmath108 , then @xmath109 and for those values @xmath110 gives the major contribution .",
    "as @xmath111 increases , say @xmath112 , both @xmath113 and @xmath114 are small . finally , for @xmath115 , @xmath116 , but @xmath110 is very small .",
    "notice that this decoupling happens in many situations in physics , otherwise all correlated systems would present aging . for normal diffusion , the convergence of the integral of the memory function to a constant value @xmath117 makes the decoupling acceptable . in that case , for broadband noise @xmath118 , as expected ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . consequently ,",
    "as long as the diffusion is normal , @xmath119 is finite independently of the character of @xmath27 ; after a time @xmath120 all the processes behave as those governed by the usual langevin equation . for anomalous diffusion , the dependence on time of the integral of the memory in eq .",
    "( [ approx_corr ] ) makes the decoupling fail . in short , the exponential behavior in normal diffusion",
    "is associated with time invariance while the non - exponential behaviour is associated with an aging process which is in essence non - markovian .",
    "we discussed the relaxation properties of a dynamical variable @xmath121 and we proved that neither exponentials nor stretched exponentials can give a full description of the relaxation process .",
    "however , these functions can be the asymptotic behaviour found in many experimental and theoretical works and we found an even function that can approach an exponential as we broaden the noise ( increase the ratio @xmath122 ) . for broad noise , the correlation function for anomalous diffusion will be a stretched exponential and finally a power - law .",
    "fractional derivatives have been successfully applied to the study of subdiffusive behaviour  @xcite .",
    "those yield @xmath123 , for @xmath124 .",
    "the gle formalism allows @xmath38 to assume the values in the range  @xcite @xmath125 , which encompass both subdiffusion and superdiffusion .",
    "there is a great advantage in our formulation , since the noise density of states exists not only in systems governed by a gle , but in most physical systems .",
    "also , we avoid the levy function which has infinite mean square deviation .",
    "as we have already mentioned , glassy systems seem to be a rich field for studying these phenomena",
    ". it would be very helpful if the relaxation process could be studied and exponent @xmath126 determined for those diffusive processes .",
