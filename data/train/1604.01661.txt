    "nowadays undergraduates are increasingly exposed to more research - related activities throughout the course of their degree .",
    "this is often done through summer research fellowships , which provide students with an opportunity to experience `` hands - on '' laboratory work , or the equivalent experience in a theoretical setting . moreover",
    ", upper level lab - courses often have a research `` flavour '' , meaning that these labs are more open - ended than their freshman counterparts .",
    "an equivalent `` open - endedness '' tends not to exist in the regular `` theoretically - oriented '' courses , although in recent decades the increased use of the computer in lessons and homework assignments has been slowly changing this.@xcite    nonetheless , in many fields in physics , a modern theme in research is the effect of interactions amongst the constituent particles . for several reasons ,",
    "undergraduates in the 21st century are well - poised to learn more about this problem , for reasons we now discuss , mainly in the context of undergraduate quantum mechanics .",
    "first , one should acknowledge that students _ are already _ exposed to particle - particle interactions  it is just that we tend to quickly disguise that this is the case .",
    "for example , the hydrogen atom problem is really a two - particle problem , whose constituents interact via the coulomb interaction .",
    "we ( wisely ) adopt center - of - mass and relative coordinates , which quickly reduces this problem to that of a single particle , albeit with reduced mass , in the presence of an ` external ' potential .",
    "this change of coordinates is a good thing , insofar it allows us a complete analytical solution to the problem.@xcite however , it provides no guidance to what is to be done as the number of particles increases , and tends to leave the student with the impression that further progress is impossible and/or requires approximation methods.@xcite    the few - body problem was most relevant in nuclear physics , as indicated by the books cited above ; however , as activity in this field has diminished , it has been replaced with increased furor in the field of ` cold atoms ' , where lasers are used to confine particles in so - called confinement traps .",
    "see some recent reviews in refs .",
    "[ ] , along with more pedagogical expositions for the experiments in ref .",
    "[ ] and for the theory in ref .",
    "[ ] . this field has exploded over the past decade , with increased interest in so - called optical lattices , along with the ability to tune all the relevant interactions , including fine details like spin - orbit coupling.@xcite remarkably , both the traps and the lattices can be manipulated to be three , two , or one - dimensional .",
    "it is mostly because of the arrival of this new ` playground ' for physicists , where particles with different statistics can be readily utilized , and crossover phenomena from weak to strong interactions can be simply tuned through manipulation of their feshbach resonances,@xcite that this explosion has occurred .    at the same time , these developments make these types of problems more accessible to the classroom . in particular , we will take advantage of the ability to ` manufacture ' systems with interacting particles in any dimension to provide a systematic ` textbook - like ' account of interacting particles in one - dimension .",
    "as in ref .",
    "[ ] we will focus primarily on two particles , but with a careful watch on how generalizations to larger numbers can ( in principle ) be performed . in this respect",
    "we will adopt the matrix mechanics used in ref .",
    "[ ] to carry out calculations in the example case of three particles .",
    "before beginning with specific examples , we write down a somewhat general form of the hamiltonian , to deal with any confining potential and various forms of the two - body interaction : @xmath0 where the sums are over the numbers of particles in the system , and the first part of the hamiltonian ( indicated in braces ) is the one - body part , including the confining potential , denoted @xmath1 .",
    "the second part contains the two - body interactions , which we will take to be solely a function of the distance between any two particles , as indicated .",
    "all particles will be taken to have mass @xmath2 , but we will reserve for special consideration the three cases of distinguishable , boson , and fermion statistics .    in the following section we start with a one dimensional confining potential that is more familiar to undergraduates  the infinite square well .",
    "we examine the procedure for understanding the behaviour of more than one particle in such a well , and then move on to the more experimentally relevant harmonic trap.@xcite we do this in several ways ; first , the least intimidating ( from the perspective of a novice ) method is to ` embed ' the harmonic potential in an infinite square well , and proceed as in the previous case .",
    "the complications with respect to the infinite square well case then arise only in the one - particle problem , following ref .",
    "the second step is to dispense with the infinite square well altogether and simply use the single particle eigenstates for the harmonic oscillator as the set of basis states .",
    "while having to deal with more complicated functions ( hermite polynomials ) this choice actually makes the problem much simpler , and conforms with the methodology used in some of the research literature .",
    "the interaction term requires a straightforward integration , which can be made very efficient ( in fact , analytical ) through a mathematical trick , which we discuss in the appendix .",
    "finally , removal of the centre - of - mass degree of freedom simplifies the problem still further , and we outline this procedure in a final subsection of section [ sec_three ] .",
    "the final section is devoted to a brief discussion of the three - particle problem ; this section serves as a ` launching - pad ' for addressing the @xmath3-particle problem .",
    "although the harmonic oscillator is well - known to students of quantum mechanics , and taught early in the curriculum , the eigenfunctions for a single particle in this potential involve the hermite polynomials , enveloped by a gaussian ; these can be somewhat daunting to the novice . another more ` theoretical ' confining potential is the infinite square well , whose eigenfunctions are the simple sine series .",
    "we therefore begin with these , with the purpose to examine the effect of interactions .",
    "the simplest form of interaction is the contact potential , that uses a dirac @xmath4-interaction between two particles in the infinite square well . while this form of the interaction is best for straightforward evaluation of the matrix elements required , it is also the poorest for convergence as a function of the number of basis states .",
    "simply put , @xmath4-function interactions tend to give rise to ` cuspiness ' in the wave function . while this was shown explicitly in the case of a one - particle interaction,@xcite",
    "it is true for many - particle interactions as well .",
    "we review one - particle results ( no interactions ) for the purpose of establishing notation.@xcite the infinite square well ( _ isw _ ) potential of width @xmath5 for a particle at position @xmath6 is defined as @xmath7 the single - particle hamiltonian is then the sum of the kinetic term and the confining potential term as defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : gen_ham ] , @xmath8 the well - known single - particle eigenstates and eigen - energies for this problem are @xmath9 and @xmath10 with the quantum number @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "the non - interacting hamiltonian for two or more particles is simply a sum of the one - particle hamiltonian over all the particles .",
    "solutions are then built out of the basis consisting of product states of the one - particle basis states of the isw ( eq .",
    "[ eq : isw basis ] ) .",
    "this means quantum labels begin to proliferate , and also depend on the statistics of the particle .",
    "for example , for two particles , we have the three cases : @xmath13\\\\ & \\textbf{bosons:}\\\\ & \\psi_{n_1,n_2}=\\begin{cases }          \\phi_{n_1}(x_1)\\phi_{n_2}(x_2 ) & n_1=n_2 \\\\          \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left[\\phi_{n_1}(x_1)\\phi_{n_2}(x_2)+\\phi_{n_2}(x_1)\\phi_{n_1}(x_2)\\right ] & n_1\\neq n_2 \\\\          \\end{cases}\\\\ \\end{split } \\label{eq : two particle basis}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 for the distinguishable case , while @xmath16 only , for both the fermion case , and for the second line in eq .",
    "[ eq : two particle basis ] of the boson case .",
    "the matrix elements are then @xmath17 where @xmath18 is shorthand for @xmath19 , and similarly for @xmath20 .",
    "if there were three particles then @xmath21 and so on . here as in the one - particle case we make the matrix elements dimensionless by dividing out @xmath22 , which is the single particle ground state energy of the infinite square well .",
    "therefore , because we used the eigenstates for the non - interacting problem , the one - body matrix elements are all diagonal : @xmath23 we should mention here that the sizes of the hilbert spaces vary , depending on the particle statistics .",
    "the case of two particles is very special ; the hilbert space for distinguishable particles happens to equal the sum of the sizes of the fermion and boson hilbert spaces , so that one can say that the states are conserved as statistics applicable to indistinguishable particles is introduced .",
    "however , in general , as the number of particles increases , the size of the hilbert space pertaining to distinguishable particles greatly exceeds the size of the other two spaces .      without interactions",
    "the problem is of course already solved , as we are using direct products of the single particle eigenstates for the basis .",
    "the introduction of particle - particle interactions produces both diagonal and off - diagonal matrix elements , @xmath24 whose evaluation depends on the form of the interaction potential . for",
    "the contact interaction , @xmath25 particles will only interact with one another if they are in the same location in space .",
    "note that the strength of the interaction is governed by the coefficient @xmath26 ; however , @xmath26 has units of @xmath27 , and so a dimensionless constant @xmath28 is defined by @xmath29 , where @xmath5 is the width of the well and @xmath30 is the single particle ground state energy in the absence of interactions .",
    "evaluating the matrix elements for this interaction yields , for distinguishable",
    "( d ) particles , @xmath31 where the matrix @xmath32 will be defined below . for fermions ( f ) , the result is @xmath33 . for bosons",
    "( b ) the result is @xmath34 as is apparent for the contact interaction , fermions do _ not _ interact with one another at all , and the matrix elements for bosons are generally larger than or equal to those for distinguishable particles , since their statistics cause bosons to spend more of their time in contact with one another .    a straightforward calculation for the general matrix element yields , @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 all take on values @xmath39 , and so the complete matrix elements are then : @xmath40 with @xmath41 , or @xmath42 , depending on the statistics and the applicable formula given above .      using a matrix diagonalization routine",
    ", one can readily obtain the eigenvalues and eigenvectors corresponding to the matrix given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : matrix elements for dirac interaction isw basis ] ) , where the matrix size is @xmath43 .",
    "the states that are included for a given @xmath44 are those whose non - interacting ( diagonal ) matrix elements are below a certain prescribed value .",
    "for example , for the infinite square well basis we would order the states according to @xmath45 , whereas for the harmonic oscillator basis ( to be discussed further below ) we would order them according to @xmath46 .",
    "figure [ fig : ifs only gs convergence ] illustrates the convergence for both an attractive and a repulsive contact potential .",
    "not so surprisingly , convergence is not complete ( to four significant figures ) even for @xmath47 , as this corresponds ( roughly ) to @xmath48 at the single particle level , which was shown to be insufficient for a @xmath4-function potential for a single particle.@xcite    , red crosses , see left ordinate ) and an attractive ( @xmath49 , blue squares , see right ordinate ) @xmath4-function interaction .",
    "as is apparent from the figure , results in both cases are converged by the time @xmath47 at the @xmath50% level . for comparison",
    "the non - interacting result has a ground state energy of @xmath51 . ]    as was reported in ref .",
    "[ ] , a @xmath4-function potential is the simplest potential with which to calculate matrix elements , but is the most difficult potential to converge as a function of basis size .",
    "this is because this potential tends to result in wave function cusps ; a cusp is difficult to represent accurately with a finite set of states .",
    "nonetheless , a good qualitative picture can still be provided , as we now demonstrate for the two - particle wave function .",
    "figure  [ fig : ifs only ags ] shows the energy spectrum obtained as a function of @xmath28 .",
    "for strong attractive interactions ( negative @xmath28 ) there are many bound states .",
    "usually only one bound state is shown , because centre - of - mass excitations are explicitly removed .",
    "this is difficult to do with the infinite square well , but we will demonstrate this below with the harmonic trap . note that because we are currently dealing with two particles only , the presence of an interaction is sufficient to split the distinguishable states into two kinds  bosonic and fermionic .",
    "the fermion states are readily identified by the fact that their energy does not depend on the strength of the interaction .",
    "a contact interaction does not affect fermion states , because fermions can not be at the same place in space at the same time .",
    "therefore , for two particles there is no need to separately calculate the energy spectrum for fermions and bosons  these emerge naturally from the spectrum for the distinguishable particle case .",
    "of course if one separates these two categories at the beginning , then the hilbert spaces for each category is significantly reduced compared to the size for the indistinguishable states , and therefore the eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be obtained more efficiently .    ,",
    "vs @xmath28 .",
    "the two particles interact with one another through a contact potential with dimensionless strength @xmath28 .",
    "these results are obtained with @xmath52 , and are therefore completely converged on the scale of this figure . as discussed in the text , with non - zero @xmath28 the states immediately split into fermionic ( horizontal lines ) and bosonic states .",
    "the fermionic states are completely unaffected by the interaction potential . as the strength of the interaction increases , the energy of the bosonic states approaches the energy of the neighbouring fermionic states , above ( for positive @xmath28 ) and below ( for negative @xmath28 ) .",
    "note that the @xmath53 energies are the familiar @xmath54 for the ground state , @xmath55 with a degeneracy of @xmath56 for the first excited state , and so on , according to the non - interacting diagonal elements listed in eq .",
    "( [ non_int_ham ] ) . ]",
    "following the spirit of the previous section , and confining our attention to the two - particle case , the most straightforward approach to treating the harmonic oscillator confining potential , @xmath57 is to imbed this potential in an infinite square well of width @xmath5 ( starting at @xmath58  hence the shift by @xmath59 ) , as defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : isw potential ] ) .",
    "care is required to maintain a well width @xmath5 sufficiently large that it does _ not _ affect our results in any way .",
    "we again use the product states , eq .",

    "these lead to the diagonal matrix elements as in eq .",
    "( [ non_int_ham ] ) .",

    "the non - interacting hamiltonian can be written as @xmath60 , with    .",
    "as @xmath28 increases , larger and larger basis sizes are needed for convergence . note that as @xmath28 increases the affect on energy saturates , as ` fermionization ' takes place .",
    "this occurs when the repulsive interaction is strong enough to keep the two particles apart from one another , i.e. as if they were fermions .",

    "figure [ fig : ifs gs convergence int ] shows the energy for the ground state as a function of the number of states used ; the impact of the contact interaction clearly slows down the convergence as a function of the number of basis states kept , especially when @xmath28 is large .",
    "convergence will also depend on the width of the well used ; in this and subsequent figures we have used a width such that the dimensionless parameter @xmath63 .",
    "this value represents a sufficiently wide well that the walls of the well do not affect the results for the ground state ( and many excited states also ) .     for two particles with mass @xmath20 each in a harmonic trap with frequency @xmath71 . as was the case with the infinite square well trap ,",
    "the fermionic states are easily identifiable as the horizontal lines that are unaffected by the interaction . also , as the interaction strength increases , the boson state energies approach the energy of the fermion state above it ( ` fermionization ' ) as was the case with the infinite square well trap . for this figure we used @xmath63 and @xmath72 . ]",
    "clearly there is a difference between the bosonic vs fermionic ( not shown ) eigenstates , since the interaction is effectively absent in the latter case .",
    "nonetheless , we do achieve convergence to a given accuracy , and these results will serve as a benchmark for more refined calculations below . note also , that for a sufficiently large @xmath28 , the two - particle wave function develops a node when the two coordinates are equal , so that further repulsion is immaterial . hence , for @xmath73 , the energy is barely increasing anymore ( as a function of @xmath28 ) . as was already noted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ifs only ags ] this saturation energy coincides with the energy of the first excited state ( which is fermionic ) .",
    "we will illustrate later that the probability associated with the wave function begins to resemble that of two fermions , so this process is sometimes referred to as `` fermionization '' .",
    "figure  [ fig : ifs",
    "ho ags ] shows the energy levels as a function of @xmath28 .",
    "these results clearly resemble those for the confining infinite square well , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ifs only ags ] .",
    "there are sets of states whose energies do not change as a function of @xmath28  these are the fermionic states for whom the contact interaction remains invisible , since two fermions can not occupy the same point in space .",
    "other ( bosonic ) states are affected by this interaction ; in particular for negative values of @xmath28 there are an increasing number of bound states as @xmath28 decreases .",
    "the origin of these will be clarified below .",
    "furthermore , as the interaction strength increases , the energy of the boson states approaches the energy of the fermion state above it  this is the phenomenon of ` fermionization ' referred to above , and the bosons , due to the large repulsion between them , behave somewhat like fermions .",
    "perhaps more surprising is the ` fermionization ' of the excited boson states at very large negative values of @xmath28 .",
    "the ground state is clearly a tightly bound two - particle state , whose energy decreases as the value of @xmath28 decreases , but the bosonic excited states also approach fermion - like states ( from above ) as is clear from the figure .",
    "this will be made more explicit with the wave - functions below .    in what follows",
    "we will take two additional steps to redo the problem just presented .",
    "first we will adopt a basis set which consists of products of the eigenstates of the single particle harmonic oscillator problem .",
    "these basis states are far more natural for the harmonic oscillator confining potential .",
    "second , we will utilize so - called centre - of - mass variables to simplify the problem from an @xmath3-body to an @xmath74-body problem .",
    "this will clearly have a more significant impact when @xmath3 is small , and we will explicitly examine @xmath75 for illustration purposes .",
    "unlike with the infinite square well basis , if we are to use the products of the single particle harmonic oscillator eigenstates as basis states , then there is no point to centring the harmonic oscillator confining potential away from @xmath58 .",
    "then the single particle problem is solved by the usual wave functions , @xmath76 with eigenenergies , @xmath77 and @xmath78 is a whole number .",
    "these solutions require the hermite polynomials , @xmath79 , whose properties should be familiar to readers of this paper.@xcite    while this basis is more complicated , it has the distinct advantage of ( i ) not requiring an `` embedding '' potential like the infinite square well , and ( ii ) no effort is required for the non - interacting case . indeed , without interactions , and defining dimensionless matrix elements this time by dividing all energies by @xmath80 , i.e. @xmath81 ( recall , following the notation of eq .",

    "including the contact interaction is straightforward ; moreover , we focus now on the distinguishable particle case only , since an interaction immediately collapses the eigenstates to either bosonic and fermionic eigenstates .",

    "the integral in eq .",
