    "we explore , in lattice qcd , the static potential of three - body systems with gluon(s ) using wilson loops , namely the quark - antiquark - gluon hybrid and the three gluons glueball .",
    "the interest in this systems is increasing because of the future experiments besiii at ihep in beijin , gluex at jlab and panda at gsi in darmstadt , dedicated to study the mass range of charmonium , with a focus in its plausible excitations and in hybrid and glueball production .",
    "the three - gluon glueballs are also relevant to the odderon .",
    "thus several models are being developed and the static potential should , at least , provide one important component of the full interaction .",

    "adjoint strings are formed while in the type ii model , the fundamental strings repulse and adjoint strings are not formed .",
    "this comes from the analogy with the two types of condensed matter superconductors ( see fig . [ type1type2 ] ) .    in the case of the hybrid meson type ii models",
    "means a fundamental string linking the quark and the antiquark to the gluon , while type i models require an adjoint string .",
    "for the three - gluon glueball , the type i i means three fundamental string linking the gluons in a triangle shape , while for the type i the three adjoint strings fuse at a common point giving rise to a starfish geometry ( see fig .",
    "[ type1type2 ] ) .",
    "to measure the static potentials in lattice qcd , we construct an operator - the wilson loop - which corresponds to our system .",
    "the mean value of this operator could be expanded in euclidean time as @xmath0 with @xmath1 being the static potential of the system .    for the case of a meson this operator",
