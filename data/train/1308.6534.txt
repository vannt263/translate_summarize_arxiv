    "this is a mathematical - modeling paper about certain types of epidemics and corresponding public - health interventions , other than by vaccines or drugs .",
    "my desire is to communicate the main points to a wider audience then just my fellow math - modelers : in particular , infectious - disease doctors and public - health officials , who are charged with responding to , and , if possible , halting , a future epidemic of a deadly disease .",
    "so i have chosen to relegate the mathematical and computational details to appendices ( which are meant to be accessible to anyone with some background in math modeling or computer science , with no prerequisites . )",
    "i also eschew the usual introduction / methods / results / discussion format and adopt the form of an essay , because i believe the flow of the argument will be easier for the general reader to follow .    to begin , recall sars , the acronym for `` severe acute respiratory syndrome , '' an atypical form of pneumonia caused by a coronavirus that generated a gobal pandemic in 2003 .",
    "the large - scale spread of sars began on february 21 of that year , when a professor of medicine in guangdong province , china , who had been treating patients with pneumonia , traveled to hong kong and checked into the metropole hotel downtown . for reasons still unclear ,",
    "the professor passed the virus on to about a dozen persons staying at the hotel .",
    "then the professor , feeling unwell , checked himself into the teaching hospital and told the staff that he had a dangerous infectious disease and should be isolated , which the staff accomplished .",
    "( the professor died of the disease in hospital . )",
    "when another patient from the hotel cluster arrived at the hospital , the staff made a medical mistake ( administering an expectorant or performing aspiration ) , and subsequently every doctor , nurse , medical student , and orderly who entered the room@xmath4 or more  developed sars .",
    "this was the first `` superspreader '' ( ss ) event of the epidemic .",
    "more such events followed : 15 + infected on a plane to beijing , 37 at a hospital in vietnam , and so forth .",
    "but the godzilla of all known ss events occurred at an apartment complex in hong kong called the amoy gardens , where a sick person visited for one night and generated 300 + secondary cases .",
    "virologists eventually traced the source of sars to bats , with an intermediate host , the civet cat , which was sold in live - animal markets in guangdong province .",
    "the final toll ( november 2002 to july 11 , 2003 , the date of the last known case ) was : 29 countries , including canada and the united states , affected ; 8098 cases ; and 774 deaths .",
    "( thus the case mortality for sars was around 10 percent ; compare to the two percent estimated for the 1918 flu . )",
    "the pandemic is thought to have been brought under control by introduction of better hospital procedures for rapidly isolating cases ; most clusters were `` nosocomial '' ( occurring in , and specific to , a medical setting ) with few secondary clusters , beyond those mentioned above , occurring in the community .",
    "as i write , a new disease caused by a different coronovirus , called the middle east respiratory syndrome ( mers ) virus , has appeared and generated cases in saudi arabia , jordan , qatar , and other countries of the arabian penninsula ( at this time , all cases outside the region have occurred in persons who had recently visited the middle east )",
    ". a steady drumbeat of sporadic cases ( 91 since september 2012 , as of 25 july 2013 ) , some generating small ss events ( mostly nosocomial ) , have been reported to the world health agency ( and can be followed on the listservice of the international society for infectious diseases called promed - mail ) .",
    "the current estimate of mers case mortality is a frightening 50 percent ( but `` case mortality '' has a denominator problem : the `` cases '' are hospitalized patients , and we do not as yet know how many milder cases are occurring in the community ) .",
    "sars , mers , and ( in one theory ) hiv all represent a different kind of epidemic than usually treated in textbooks ( particularly those that emphasize modeling ) .",
    "i will refer to a `` superspreader epidemic , '' sse for shorthand .",
    "much of the conventional wisdom about epidemics does not apply to the sse case .",
    "i informally describe models for an sse , leaving details about software implementation and mathematical issues to appendices .",
    "the appropriate kind of model is called a `` stochastic multi - type . ''",
    "the adjective `` stochastic '' refers to random events , as in a dice game ; in computer terms , when simulating the model the program makes calls on the , abbreviated rng ( supplied with your operating system ) , when making updates .",
    "the `` '' was introduced by mathematicians in the 1920s to describe , among other things , epidemics .",
    "( other applications include demographic  growth and nuclear chain - reactions . ) in a , some entity produces a ( random ) number of `` offspring '' at some rate , not depending on the number of other entities existing , for some ( also possibly random ) reproductive period ; the offspring , which may be of various types , can generate descendants in a similar manner .",
    "( the particular sort of  i use may differ from the kind described in math texts , however ; see the appendices for the details . )",
    "mathematical biologists also introduced a deterministic model of epidemics dubbed `` sir , '' for susceptible - infected - recovered , appropriate to describe a measles or influenza epidemic . here",
    "i am interested in interventions that bring the disease to a halt before it establishes an epidemic , so the susceptible  can be regarded as fixed .",
    "( by the time a moderate fraction of the  of a major city or country had sars or mers , the pandemic would long since have been declared by who and , given the modern phenomenon of `` jet spread , '' airport closures and international panic would soon follow . ) in addition , as the reader will understand from the results described below , a deterministic model of an sse is totally inappropriate .",
    "was not too large .",
    "science rejected the paper , with the sole reviewer s comment being : `` the model looks right , the conclusion looks right , but it does nt penetrate ! '' in fact , the outcome of the epidemic was as we predicted . later that spring , science published papers from two modeling groups ; one used odes ,  @xcite , which is absurd , and another ,  @xcite , a model like the authors , with similar conclusions .",
    "the latter group had access to case incidence data from hong kong , which our group lacked ( we derived our model from published accounts , mostly in newspapers and on who and cdc websites ) . later , the present author fit a stochastic model to the hong kong data , see @xcite , chapter 6 , in order to derive disease transmission parameters and demonstrate a new fitting technique .",
    "] this is true for much of biology , despite the widespread use of deterministic equations , called by the ancient acronym `` odes '' whose significance nobody recalls , by mathematical biologists ; see my book , @xcite .",
    "now we come to the famous `` @xmath0 , '' also called the basic , or mean , reproductive number of the virus , which was historically the original `` tipping - point . ''",
    "it is defined as the average number of secondary cases caused ( infected directly by ) a primary case , in the absence of any treatment or intervention .",
    "as we will see , that number of secondary infections should be thought of as a , so it has a variance as well as a mean ; to uphold tradition , i denote it by @xmath1 .",
    "now we must carefully distinguish two epidemic scenarios , which i will call the `` uniform '' ( or poisson ) and the superspreader ( ss ) epidemics .",
    "in the former , the number of secondary cases of a primary case ( assumed for this discussion to have a fixed infectious period ) is a poisson , which is the name given in  theory for the number of events in a random but constant - rate accrual process , like the number of hits inside the ring by a darts - player of little skill .",
    "the poisson  is characterized by @xmath5 and a ( super - exponential ) fall off beyond the mean ; e.g. , if @xmath0 = 2 , the probability of the primary case producing 10 secondary infections is infinitesimal .",
    "models in which such accruals have larger variances are said to possess `` '' ( epv ) .",
    "what could be the meaning of this epv ?",
    "the more - infectious case ",
    "i will also refer to this person as a superspreader  might have a special biological ability to spread the infection ( perhaps through vomiting , diarrhea , or just a deep cough ) , or might be situated in some place that facilitates transmission ( e.g. , in a crowded icu , but not in isolation ; on a plane ; or visiting the amoy gardens ) .",
    "the simplest example , that i use throughout this paper for illustrations , is an epidemic model with two types of infected persons , each making a poisson - distributed number of secondary cases .",
    "the person of type one has an average number of secondary cases of @xmath6 ( the subscript meaning lower - value ) , and the type - two person , @xmath7 ( high - level ) ; these occur with probabilities @xmath8 and @xmath9 , so the  average is :        mathematicians proved in the 1920s that a  with @xmath2 can grow , while one with @xmath16 eventually dies out .",
    "but it is often overlooked that a with @xmath2 _ can nevertheless go extinct_. the outcome of a  with @xmath2 ( mathematicians use the phrase , `` supercritical '' ) is dichotomous : either heading for infinity or destined to die out , with certain probabilities .",
    "for instance , the process with the r s above plus assumptions about incubation periods , infectious periods , etc . , resulting in various models ; ( see the appendices ) will disappear eventually with probability @xmath17 in the range @xmath18@xmath19 . for the uniform case , @xmath20",
    ", @xmath17 is about @xmath21 . as a rule , @xmath17 increases with increasing @xmath1 for fixed @xmath0 .",
    "this is easy to understand : the most probable `` index '' ( epidemiology jargon for initial ) case is a low - infectivity patient , and , although one or more secondary cases might follow while the patient remains infectious ( even if @xmath22 ) , the infection - chain is likely to die out unless preserved by the appearance of a superspreader .    see table 1 for some illustrative examples .",
    "the simulation technique i used is described in appendix one , and the parameters are listed there in table a. i also included results in the table from an exactly - solvable model , meaning explicit formulas exist for extinction probabilities ( see appendix two ) , called the markov case .",
    "i included it to satisfy mathematicians and to check the software , by comparing  from repeated simulations to exact answers ; but it has a feature that renders it dubious for use in biology .",
    "the markov case is the model in which all waiting times  times to end of the incubation period ; to end of the infectious period ; and to generate the next secondary case  have exponential distributions ( see appendix two for the explanation of why the famous `` markov property '' requires exponential distributions for all waiting times ) . but only for the last mentioned is this a realistic choice : the exponential law was derived from physics , where it represents radioactive decay ; but people are not atoms . for applications i assumed , pending more data , normal distributions for the incubation and infectious periods ( conditional on non - negativity , of course ) . for these models",
    ", simulation must be used to compute  ( for reasons spelled out in appendix two ) .",
    "so the last column in the table represents the biologically more - realistic case .",
    "the reason that the entries in this column are the smallest in the rows is that the markov case has more epv ; see appendix two .          on the basis of this result",
    ", i must agree that @xmath32 for mers at present .",
    "note however that the good fit of table e to table c is attained because an ss model reproduces the big cluster in the last row of the latter .",
    "the lancet authors choice to limit their model - class to a poisson distribution for secondary cases ruled out this possibility  a superspreader , multiple - levels , epidemic model , but with @xmath0 less than one_a priori_. on the other hand , `` fitting '' a three - parameter model to data consisting of seven frequencies can not be recommended either .    now a bit of preaching about modeling traps .",
    "when you have a model with free parameters and a data - set , there are two ways to delude yourself .",
    "methods like bayesian analysis , possible if you have an explicit likelihood , or my nknn method , which works for anything provided you can simulate fast enough , will generate a `` best - fitting model . ''",
    "if some parameter ( like the plos authors dispersion parameter ) fluctuates so much that it ca nt be pinned down , you can choose to omit it ",
    ", mutilate the model in order to be able to `` estimate the parameters . '' or you can keep the troublesome parameter and let the software choose a `` best model . ''",
    "either way , the model selected may be false ; but you wo nt discover that until more data arrives . in my book , @xcite , i labeled these two pitfalls the `` simple - is - best trap '' and the `` etch - a - sketch trap '' and argued that the modeler is required to steer between these two hazards , like odysseus sailing between skylla and charybdis .",
    "fall in the first , and your parameter estimates will be wrong or biologically unintelligible ; fall in the other , and your model can `` explain '' anything ( which karl popper decried as not science ) .",
    "ultimately , the best approach is to make a prediction  even when it fails , you will have learned something .",
    "( unfortunately , on the basis of the data thus far available , making a prediction about mers is impossible . )",
