    "low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) can be divided into black hole candidates and neutron star systems . those with orbital periods of hours to days are expected to have hydrogen - rich mass donors .",
    "a few ultra - compact x - ray binaries ( ucxbs ) containing hydrogen - deficient and possibly degenerate donors can evolve to extremely small binary separations , with orbital periods as short as a few minutes @xcite .",
    "although these systems were initially assumed to be rare , many candidates have now been found .",
    "the x - ray source 4u  0614 + 091 was first optically identified by @xcite with a faint ( @xmath0mag ) , blue , variable star ( v1055  ori ) located in the galactic plane .",
    "several arguments recently concluded 4u  0614 + 091 is a ucxb hosting a neutron star .",
    "@xcite found an enhanced neon to oxygen ratio in 4u  0614 + 091 similar to that seen in other ucxbs . through sensitive optical spectroscopy , @xcite and @xcite found significant carbon and oxygen emission lines , but no hydrogen or helium .",
    "they argued 4u  0614 + 091 contains a carbon - oxygen accretion disk .",
    "recently , @xcite reported the discovery of a broad emission feature at @xmath1 kev , which is attribute of o  viii ly@xmath2 emission , in the spectra of 4u  0614 + 09 .",
    "this feature has been seen so far in two systems @xcite that are receiving oxygen - rich material from the co or one white dwarf .",
    "it is an endorsement of an oxygen - rich mass donor star .",
    "thermonuclear type i x - ray bursts were observed by oso-8 @xcite , and assuming they were eddington limited , deduced a distance to 4u  0614 + 091 probably @xmath3kpc .",
    "more recently have re - examined archival bursts from several satellites and derived a distance of 3.2kpc .",
    "these authors argue that the bursts require more helium in the accreted matter than would be consistent with the optical spectra leaving the nature of the mass donor still in question .",
    "a straightforward resolution of this puzzle has been elusive due to the difficulty in identifying an orbital period .",
    "@xcite found a 10-d photometric modulation which might be caused by precession of an accretion disc .",
    "they then scaled the precession period of her  x-1 to 4u  0614 + 091 to infer the orbital period . if the ratio of the disc radius to the neutron star roche lobe radius , @xmath4 is assumed to be @xmath5 , @xmath6 . if @xmath7 then @xmath8 .",
    "either way , this argument suggests a non - ucxb system with a hydrogen - rich donor .",
    "however , the faintness of its x - ray emission in spite of a nearby distance suggest 4u  0614 + 091 has a very low accretion rate more consistent with an orbital period @xmath9 hr @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite reported a tentative 50min optical period and @xcite also claimed a strong modulation of 51.3mins . a spectroscopic modulation on a period close to this may also be present @xcite .",
    "these recent results support the case that 4u  0614 + 091 is a ucxb system .",
    "the orbital period is not the only periodicity expected .",
    "superhumps at close to the orbital period can occur in short period ( and usually small mass ratio ) lmxbs due to the beat between the orbital period and a slowly precessing accretion disk @xcite .",
    "millihertz quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) also occur , but are rarely observed at optical wavelengths .",
    "the exception is 4u  162667 which is a lmxb source containing a 7.66s x - ray pulsar in an ultra - compact 42min orbit .",
    "130mhz ( @xmath10 ) x - ray pulsations are seen , a 48mhz ( @xmath11 ) qpo is produced by an interaction between the pulsar s magnetosphere and the accretion disk , and a 1mhz ( @xmath12min ) uv qpo were found @xcite . only the 1mhz qpo was not detected in simultaneous x - ray observations .",
    "@xcite suggested that the 1mhz oscillations are due to warping of the inner accretion disk .",
    "we present here new optical photometry of 4u  0614 + 091 revealing a new mhz qpo and further evidence for a @xmath13min period . in section  [ reductionsection ]",
    "we describe our data .",
    "the lightcurves are analysed in section  [ analysissection ] and compared with contemporaneous x - ray observations in section  [ xraysection ] . finally in section  [ discussionsection ]",
    "we discuss the implications of a @xmath13min orbital period and the possible origin of the qpo .",
    "we performed fast optical photometry of 4u  0614 + 091 on three nights in december 2007 with the 2.1 m  ( 82  ) otto struve telescope at mcdonald observatory , texas ( table  [ table : obs_log ] ) .",
    "approximately 7 hours of data were obtained on each night . for convenience",
    "we will refer to the nights as night 1 , night 2 , or night 6 for the remainder of this work .",
    "we used the argos ccd photometer @xcite .",
    "this is a ccd camera designed for fast photometry that was originally designed for pulsating white dwarfs , but has proven ideal for interacting binaries .",
    "it is possible to obtain exposures as short as 1 second with negligible dead - time between exposures .",
    "hence it is ideally suited to relatively short period phenomena , such as ucxb orbital periods and mhz qpos .    as listed in table [ table : obs_log ] , a total of 8132 ccd image frames were taken with an exposure time of 10sec per frame .",
    "timing was synced to gps 1s ticks and checked against multiple ntp servers .",
    "all images used a broad @xmath14 filter to maximize the source count rate .",
    "custom idl software written for argos data was used to subtract dark current and bias , and apply flat field corrections to the data before performing aperture photometry of 4u  0614 + 091 and a brighter comparison star .",
    "all results reported here are based on differential photometry relative to the comparison star , which showed no signs of variability .",
    ".optical observing log for 4u  0614 + 091 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     where a mixture of periodic , quasi - periodic , and aperiodic variability is present , as may be the case in these data , a superposition of multiple lorentzians has become widely used for power spectral analysis in lmxbs @xcite .",
    "while these techniques were developed to describe x - ray data , there is no reason that they should not also be applicable to optical data too .",
    "the primary advantage of a lorentzian description of the variability components is that all quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) and noise components can be fitted in the same way ; it is not necessary to decide the nature of each component in advance .",
    "following @xcite , an individual lorentzian component is given by , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the integrated fractional r.m.s .",
    "of each lorentzian , and @xmath17 is its half width at the half maximum ( hwhm ) .    we show in figure  [ fig : sp_log ] the power spectra and the fitting functions in the ( @xmath18 ) representation @xcite , where the power spectral density is multiplied by its fourier frequency .",
    "it is helpful to associate a characteristic frequency with each lorentzian component .",
    "we follow x - ray convention and use @xmath19 as the characteristic frequency for broad features .",
    "this is the maximum in the @xmath18 representation and defined by , @xmath20 see @xcite , where @xmath21 is the quality factor , defined as @xmath22 . for narrow features , @xmath23 .",
    "previous research using this technique on different sources was done in a higher frequency range , 0.01100hz , typical of frequencies seen in x - ray data , e.g. @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these authors have found correlations between characteristic frequencies and break frequencies of low and high frequency noise .",
    "our optical results show similar complexity , with multiple components required , but in a lower frequency range than typically studied in x - ray observations , exploiting the longer uninterrupted time - series obtainable from the ground .",
    "we found that to obtain a satisfactory fit , four lorentzian components plus statistical white noise were needed .",
    "we began with the two frequencies already isolated , but found that we could not obtain a fit without excess power remaining at both higher and lower frequencies .",
    "one zero - centered lorentzian component was added for very low frequency noise ( vlf noise ) ; this is a band - limited noise component .",
    "the last lorentzian component is fitting the higher frequency peak revealed only in the @xmath18 representation as residual power around 3mhz .",
    "the characteristic frequencies and integrated noise are listed in table  [ table : lorentparameter ] .",
    "the quoted errors in @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath16 are 1@xmath26 confidence limits .",
    "as clearly seen in figure  [ fig : sp_log ] , the three peak features can all be identified on each night in this representation .",
    "the first two of them are relatively narrow features . because no significant differences are present between @xmath24 and @xmath25 , we take @xmath25 as the frequency of the feature .",
    "feature 1 with an average of 0.35mhz is most significant on night 1 and night 6 .",
    "hence , we ignore results from night 2 for this period .",
    "the second sharp feature with average of 1.03mhz is especially strong on night 2 but is also present on night 6 .",
    "results from night 1 are ignored for feature 2 . generally , the average results for these features are very consistent with results from gaussian fitting of the linearly scaled power spectra .",
    "feature 3 is quite broad .",
    "the average of @xmath25 from all three nights is calculated .",
    "it is centered at 3.46mhz with about a 4% uncertainty .",
    "unlike the other features , the 1mhz qpo can be clearly seen in the lightcurves , allowing direct study in the temporal domain . in order to better understand the 1mhz qpo",
    ", we examined the stability of its phase . to do this",
    "we performed a sliding sine wave fit to the night 2 data .",
    "we used a 1000sec window shifting with small step sizes of 100sec and fitted a sine wave fixed at the 16.2min period , but with its phase and amplitude as a free parameter . the change in phase with time",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : phase ] .",
    "an unexpected phase change occurs around 9500sec .",
    "the phase is basically separated into two segments , differing by 0.34 in phase . as a check , we also examined individual segments of the light curve by eye and confirmed that the phase change can be seen at this time .",
    "this confirms that the signal is quasi - periodic in nature and not a true period .",
    "our observations lie outside of the frequency range commonly studied in x - rays . for example , @xcite terminate the power spectra densities ( psds ) of 4u  0614 + 091 around 10mhz .",
    "some of their psds do reveal a very low frequency noise component overlapping with our frequency range .",
    "we have searched for an x - ray mhz qpo with contemporaneous x - ray observations from the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) .",
    "we chose the proportional counter array ( pca ) b band data , which is concentrated in a low energy band , 25kev and examined data from dates nearest to our observation , from dec 1315 2007 .",
    "lightcurves were produced in the usual way using heasoft version 6.8 .",
    "lightcurves were extracted in 16sec bins , with a maximum duration of 51.2min .",
    "we used the lightcurves to generate low - frequency power - spectra , and show these in fig .",
    "[ fig : pca ] .",
    "there is no evidence for an x - ray oscillation coincident with our 1mhz optical feature , although this may be a consequence of the non - simultaneity of the data .",
    "this is similar to the situation in 4u  1626 - 67 @xcite .",
    "this is a 42min orbital period system showing a strong 15 min uv and optical qpo without an x - ray counterpart .",
    "including the new results here , there are now four independent observations supporting an optical periodicity of approximately 50min ( @xcite and our results ) . besides confirming the nature of 4u  0614 + 091 as an ultracompact source , identification of the 50min period as orbital would have important implications for the nature of the companion star .",
    "we should keep in mind , however , that a periodicity that is detected repeatedly is not necessarily an orbital period .",
    "the possible presence of it in spectroscopic data would suggest an orbital origin , but this detection was very marginal @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that the companion was a co white dwarf based on optical detections of carbon and oxygen lines , but an absence of hydrogen and helium .",
    "@xcite reconsidered this argument based on chemical abundance predictions from new models and favour either a hybrid white dwarf or a very evolved helium star donor . for a 50min orbital period ,",
    "these two possibilities become observationally similar .",
    "an additional consideration is that the presence of type i x - ray bursts suggests the presence of helium in the accreted material .",
    "both helium star and hybrid white dwarf models could include mass - transfer phases where co - enriched material with a non - negligible helium fraction is transferred , although the upper limits on the helium fraction implied by the non - detection of helium lines seem in contradiction to the helium fraction required for x - ray bursts .",
    "the presence of apparent helium bursts in helium deficient ucxbs appears to be a recurrent problem @xcite .",
    "these authors proposed a generic solution to this problem in which co rich material is accreted but then spallation reactions near the surface of the neutron star break these elements up in to hydrogen and helium which can then be burnt back to heavier elements during bursts @xcite .",
    "we note that this mechanism will not work in pure co material as spallation requires elements of quite different atomic number to be present .",
    "if some helium is present in the accreted material , however , then this mechanism could potentially work to increase the helium fraction above that seen in the disk spectra .    a third possibility for a 50min binary would be that the donor star is an evolved main - sequence star that has lost most of its hydrogen envelope .",
    "in this case , however , we would expect cno processed abundances with nitrogen more abundant than carbon and oxygen , in contradiction to optical spectroscopy @xcite , so this possibility can probably be discounted .    a major difficulty with identifying the donor as a white dwarf or evolved helium star comes in the expected x - ray luminosity of the system .",
    "x - ray observations indicate an average luminosity of @xmath27ergs@xmath28 . in a neutron star system with no event horizon",
    "the x - ray luminosity should be a reasonable indicator of mass transfer rate , and in any case a lower - limit on it .",
    "one uncertainty remaining is that 4u  0614 + 091 does eject jets @xcite .",
    "a more comprehensive study , however , suggests that only 10percent of the accretion luminosity is being carried by the jets @xcite .",
    "this constraint , together with the observed x - ray luminosity , implies a mass transfer rate of @xmath29m@xmath30yr@xmath28 .",
    "this is much larger ( by an order of magnitude ) than expected for the hybrid white dwarf or evolved helium star models at 50min and evolving to longer periods ( @xcite ) .",
    "the inferred mass transfer rate would be about right for an evolved main - sequence star , but as discussed above this appears inconsistent with the chemical abundances .",
    "it is certainly possible that the 50min periodicity is not the orbital period , as none of the measurements demonstrate that the deduced modulations have to be orbital in origin .",
    "a white dwarf or helium star scenario would give the right mass transfer rate for a shorter period below @xmath31mins ( as earlier suggested by @xcite ) . in this case , our mhz qpo would be a candidate for the orbital period , and might then be attributed a superhump @xcite .",
    "it is probably not the orbital period which should be strictly coherent , as we have seen phase shifts . even in the case of a superhump ,",
    "however , it is hard to see how a phase shift such as this could arise since it would involve a readjustment of the accretion disk on close to its dynamical timescale .",
    "if the orbital period is indeed below 30min , we then also have to explain the origin of the recurrent 50min timescale .",
    "a more natural explanation for a large amplitude mhz oscillation seen in the optical but not x - rays , and that is able to undergo large phase shifts in a single cycle is that it originates further into the accretion disk but in regions too cool to produce x - rays .",
    "optical light in 4u  0614 + 091 appears to be dominated by the accretion disk @xcite so participation by the disk is probably necessary to obtain a 10percent amplitude .",
    "the frequency and strong amplitude of our mhz oscillation strikingly resembles that seen in 4u  162667 @xcite .",
    "that system too shows a co spectrum and is identified as likely containing a hybrid white dwarf or helium star donor @xcite .",
    "the orbital period of 42min is a close match to that proposed for 4u  0614 + 091 , but much more secure since it is seen in pulse - timing residuals . for this orbital period",
    "the mass transfer rate inferred for a white dwarf donor is also about an order of magnitude greater than that expected from gravitational radiation @xcite , a problem similar to that encountered if we attribute a 50min orbital period to 4u  0614 + 091 .",
    "@xcite suggested that the oscillation in 4u  162667 arises from a purely geometric effect , the tilt angle of the normal to the local disk surface varies with azimuth .",
    "the reprocessed emission would be expected to be sensitive to warping material along the line of sight .",
    "@xcite suggested the magnetic torque from the pulsar interacting with the accretion disk may produce the warping effect .",
    "the similarity of behavior in 4u  0614 + 091 , however , appears at odds with this as there is no evidence that this system also harbors a neutron star with a significant magnetic field .",
    "a possible solution is proposed by @xcite . in the absence of a magnetized compact object",
    ", it is suggested that magnetic fields threading the disk itself could cause magnetically driven warping .",
    "this idea was proposed in the context of systems with a magnetically - driven outflow .",
    "multiwavelength observations suggest the presence of a jet - like outflow is 4u  0614 + 091 @xcite and so this may be a natural system in which to invoke this effect .    as a final remark",
    ", we note that the mhz oscillation is not seen alone , but as one of three frequencies that are recurring from night to night .",
    "while one of these may be orbital , it is possible that none are .",
    "we are thus not looking for a mechanism that can give rise to a single oscillation , but to a more complex multi - periodic behavior , rather reminiscent of that see at much higher frequencies in x - rays @xcite .",
    "this would suggest a more complex multi - modal warping of the accretion disk as a possible mechanism .",
    "we have focused on the 1mhz qpo here because it can be seen clearly in the lightcurves , and so studied in the time - domain .",
    "the 3.5mhz qpo is certainly also of interest but with less information , and no obvious timescale to associate it with , it is harder to say anything about it .",
    "more observations will be needed to properly disentangle the behavior seen , for example by looking for correlations between changes in the oscillation frequencies to test if they are linked or independent .",
    "we have identified three persistent , distinct , periodic or quasi - periodic oscillations in the optical flux from 4u  0614 + 091 . the 0.35 mhz ( 48 min ) period",
    "was suggested to be an orbital period by @xcite and @xcite , and supported by @xcite .",
    "if it is indeed orbital , it would confirm 4u  0614 + 091 as an ultracompact binary , @xcite .",
    "the origin of the 1mhz qpos now seen in both 4u  0614 + 091 and 4u  162667 remains unknown , if they are even related to each other .",
    "it likely originates in the accretion disk and could arise as the precession period of inner disk regions that are not hot enough to produce x - ray emission .",
    "the less prominent 3mhz qpo may be related to this , or may be distinct .",
    "support for these observations was provided by a louisiana state university council on research faculty research grant .",
    "r.i.h . also acknowledges support from nasa / louisiana board of regents grant nnx07at62a / leqsf(2007 - 10 ) phase3 - 02 and national science foundation grant no .",
