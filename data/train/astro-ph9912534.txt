    "during the last two decades , substructure was detected in a significant fraction of groups and clusters of galaxies , both as double or secondary maxima in the sky - projected galaxy distribution of clusters ( cf .",
    "@xcite and geller & beers 1982 ) , and as deviations of spherical symmetry in x - ray contour maps ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , quantifying substructure in clusters is a non - trivial problem . analyzing substructure indicators with numerical simulations , west et al .",
    "( 1988 ) concluded that many subclumps may be pure chance projections , and that the remaining abundance of substructure can barely discriminate between a wide range of cosmological scenarios .",
    "projection effects are less pronounced in x - rays , and recent x - ray data have provided more reliable information on the abundance of substructure ( cf .",
    "@xcite and buote & xu 1997 ) .    in the optical spectral range ,",
    "one gets better results by including velocity information for a large sample of cluster galaxies .",
    "substructure was identified using subgroup velocity statistics in clusters ( @xcite ) , finding velocity offsets of cd galaxies with respect to the major cluster ( @xcite ) , employing the hierarchical tree algorithm ( @xcite ) and wavelet analysis ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently , dressler & shectman s statistics were used by zabludoff & mulchaey ( 1998 ) for 6 poor groups , and by solanes et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for 67 rich clusters from the enacs survey .",
    "these different analyses agreed in @xmath1 of clusters which showed statistically significant substructure . but",
    "it appears that this amount depends on the analysis method ( @xcite ) and on the imposed reliability criterion .",
    "the existence of substructure in clusters suggests that the clusters are young objects since loosely bound subgroups can survive only a few cluster crossing times , i.e. , shorter than the hubble time . in the framework of the hierarchical structure formation scenario ,",
    "clusters grow mainly by mergers of smaller objects and by accretion ; substructure point to recent major mergers . starting from these ideas and the early termination of growth of density perturbations in a low density universe ,",
    "the abundance of substructure was suggested as an effective measure of the mean matter density in the universe ( richstone , loeb & turner 1992 , bartelmann , ehlers & schneider 1993 , kauffman & white 1993 , and lacey & cole 1994 ) .",
    "the interpretation of subclusters as recent mergers might explain also some of the properties of cd cluster galaxies , such as their orientation with respect to the environment ( @xcite ) and the peculiar velocity distribution in rich clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "the velocity kinematics as a signature of substructure traces the galaxy distribution , therefore we employed dissipationless simulations in a large cosmological environment .",
    "the cosmological models take cobe - normalized perturbation spectra in four cosmological scenarios .",
    "earlier theoretical studies concentrated on the analysis of the density contrast of clusters and the density profile ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "there , relatively small differences in the cluster properties are found when comparing cluster profiles at the same overdensity .",
    "this concerns mainly the properties of relaxed clusters .",
    "here we study in particular clusters which represent deviations from an equilibrium . for quantifying substructure in x - ray profiles of clusters , hydrodynamic simulations of cluster formation have to be employed , and early attempts at this have already yielded first promising results ( @xcite and valdarnini , ghizzardi & bonometto 1999 ) .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "first we analyze the method for identification of substructure in galaxy clusters selected from numerical simulations .",
    "then we apply the algorithm to different cosmological models . in section 4",
    "we compare the substructure measure with other methods and with observational data .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of our results .",
    "the dressler & shectman ( 1998 ) statistics evaluate the velocity kinematics of galaxy groups identified in sky projected clusters .",
    "to be specific , one takes a number of neighbours @xmath2 from each galaxy in the projection , determines the mean velocity @xmath3 and velocity dispersion @xmath4 of the subsample , and compares this with the mean velocity @xmath5 and velocity dispersion @xmath6 of the whole group ,    @xmath7\\ ] ]    a measure of the amount of clumpiness in the cluster is the sum of the individual positive @xmath8 over all cluster galaxies @xmath9 , @xmath10 which is called the delta - deviation .",
    "the @xmath0-deviation is large for groups with kinematically distinct subgroups .",
    "[ bubble ] illustrates the statistics for a simulated typical dark matter cluster selected with a linking length of 0.2 times the mean interparticle spacing . around each point",
    "a circle is plotted with radius proportional to @xmath11 .",
    "the cluster has a pronounced centre indicated by the central particles in the figure decorated with the small circles .",
    "to the right and above from the centre there are some subclumps which do not represent especially important subgroups with decoupled kinematics , but most probably they are small satellites slowly falling onto the group centre . to the left , there are some particles with large @xmath8 that contribute mostly to the cumulative @xmath0-deviation . the cluster in fig .  [ bubble",
    "] represents an example for marginally reliable substructure , we base our later statistical analysis on clusters with more pronounced substructure",
    ". an obvious advantage of the method is that no _ a priori _ selections or assumptions about the positions of subclumps have to be imposed .    in order to test and calibrate the statistics , we have compared five clusters of masses of about @xmath12 ( 1000 particles ) , @xmath13 ( 500 particles ) , and @xmath14 ( 200 particles ) in a standard cdm simulation . for each mass",
    "we study clusters both with and without obvious substructure as decided by eye from the 3-dimensional distribution .",
    "the @xmath0-deviation statistics depend on the number of cluster galaxies with measured redshift @xmath9 that can be included in the analysis , and on the number of neighbours in tested subgroups @xmath15 .",
    "if one assumes a random distribution of velocities one expects values @xmath16 ( dressler & shectman 1988 ) , and for galaxy clusters with substructure , @xmath17 ( @xcite )",
    ". therefore we normalize @xmath0 with the total number of galaxies investigated , and in fig .",
    "[ nlocal ] we plotted @xmath18 against the number of neighbours @xmath2 in subgroups .",
    "the selected groups with substructures ( solid lines ) show increasing values if the clusters have a large mass .",
    "only the poor clusters lead to a poor discrimination of substructure .",
    "the curves suggest the use of a rather high value for the number of neighbours , while pinkney et al .",
    "( 1996 ) propose @xmath19 .",
    "the maximum for low mass objects ( more than 200 particles ) lies at about 25 neighbours which we therefore took as a reasonable value for the number of nearest neighbours in the following analysis .",
    "we took a fixed number in order to be independent of the sampling rate of velocities .",
    "a similar plot of @xmath18 over the number of objects in clusters randomly selected demonstrates a very stable discrimination of clusters with substructure from those that are in equilibrium , and @xmath18 remains almost constant for values @xmath20 .",
    "ideally this would be the number of required redshifts to be measured for analyzing clusters for substructure .",
    "we apply the substructure statistics to a set of cosmological models that are currently under investigation .",
    "three of the models are cobe normalized according to the prescription of bunn & white ( 1997 ) where we assume pure adiabatic perturbations and a baryon content of @xmath21 .",
    "the standard cdm model ( scdm1 ) is taken as a reference model despite its enhanced power at cluster scales .",
    "in particular it produces too high a cluster abundance . as more realistic alternatives we take an ocdm model with @xmath22 and a @xmath23cdm model with @xmath24 and a cosmological constant to provide spatial flatness ( i.e. @xmath25 ) .",
    "both models are promising since they lead nearly to the observed cluster abundance ( @xcite ) , and they represent models which reproduce the observed superclustering of galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to these three models we have used the output of the scdm1 model at a redshift @xmath26 to ensure the correct cluster abundance ( scdm2 ) .",
    "the model parameters are summarized in table  [ simuparam ] .",
    "in particular it is shown that the simulations are running in boxes that are identical in physical size @xmath27 , thereby making small differences in the mass resolution @xmath28 despite the different density parameters .",
    "all models were run using the adaptive p@xmath29 m code of couchman ( 1991 ) with @xmath30 particles .",
    "an analysis of the virialization of clusters in these simulations can be found in a previous paper ( knebe & mller 1999 ) .",
    ".cosmological scenarios and percentage of substructure .",
    "the box size  @xmath27 is given in  @xmath31mpc , and the particle mass  @xmath28 in units of @xmath32 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as we have recently shown in simulations ( knebe & mller 1999 ) , unvirialized particle groups can be identified with recent or ongoing mergers which could be a possible explanation for substructure .",
    "for this reason we have separated ` virialized ' and ` unvirialized ' clusters .",
    "the corresponding differential distribution of the delta - deviation in the scdm1 model is shown in fig .",
    "[ dbound ] .",
    "unvirialized clusters clearly have more substructure than relaxed systems .",
    "substructure is therefore a clear sign of incomplete relaxation .",
    "note that the distributions of virialized and unvirialized groups are separately normalized , but the number of unvirialized groups is always much smaller .",
    "the same behaviour is also found for the other models .",
    "for testing the delta - deviation against other substructure indicators , we have also employed the friends - of - friends algorithm with a smaller linking length .",
    "similar to the hierarchical tree ( @xcite , klypin et al .",
    "1999 ) , we determine the mass fraction of the two most massive subgroups to produce multiplicity statistics . to this aim , we build fof clusters with half of the linking length of the original analysis .",
    "then the total mass @xmath33 of each particle group of the first analysis is decomposed into @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the masses of the two most massive subclumps .",
    "the remaining mass @xmath37 consists of all the constituents lying in low density parts of the cluster , probably containing mainly satellites recently accreted .",
    "we define the multiplicity of each cluster to be @xmath38 for @xmath39 we do not resolve substructure because the second most massive subgroup does not contribute to the total mass of the object . but for @xmath40 both subclumps are of comparable mass and therefore we have a cluster with a possible double structure . a probable origin is a big merger of almost equal - mass progenitors .",
    "[ multidelta ] shows the correlation of @xmath41 and @xmath42 for the scdm1 simulation .",
    "the other models look similar .",
    "the lines separate regions where both statistics indicate there to be substructure .",
    "one notes a weak correlation with a wide scatter and a large number of outliers .",
    "the points in the upper left part show high values of the delta - deviation for which the multiplicity test shows that the subgroups are not very massive .",
    "so , they are probably small satellites falling onto the main cluster as seen , e.g. , in fig .",
    "[ bubble ] .",
    "the lower right part shows clusters with subclumps of nearly equal masses , but no velocity deviations . a possible explanation are projection effects .",
    "another interesting point is the relationship of the remaining mass @xmath43 to the mass of the two most massive subclumps @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "if @xmath43 is not negligible , we expect a loosely bound cluster with a large portion of accreted material which may be formed recently . in fig .",
    "[ multimass ] we show the correlation between @xmath44 and the multiplicity @xmath42 for the scdm1 simulation .",
    "the straight line gives the equality between @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "above it we find loosely bound clusters which are obviously exceptions ( about 13% ) .",
    "below this line , the influence of recently accreted material is small .",
    "the loosely bound clusters lie mainly in the range where the multiplicity distribution indicates no significant substructure .",
    "this means that a steady accretion of material onto galaxy clusters tends to destroy substructure .",
    "also we checked that a large accretion leads mostly to low values of @xmath18 .    in fig .",
    "[ dmodelmass ] we show the dependence of identified substructure on the cluster mass @xmath33 in the scdm1 model .",
    "we find particle groups with and without substructure over the whole mass range , but the scatter for light clusters is much larger . when restricting to higher mass objects , the percentage of groups with substructure increases , and it leads to a value of about 30% , as in observed cluster samples ( note that above we took a fixed cluster density which are taken from the same high mass range ) .",
    "we quantified substructure in simulated clusters of galaxies using the delta - deviation statistics proposed by dressler & shectman ( 1988 ) . towards this aim",
    ", we studied the scaling of the statistics with the multiplicity of the total cluster and with the multiplicity of subgroups .",
    "even with an optimal choice of both parameters which requires a large numbers of observed redshifts , we get a broad distribution for the statistics .",
    "the amount of subclustering depends on the chosen criterion , and we can reasonably reproduce the amount of substructure found recently in galaxy clusters redshift surveys .",
    "the chosen criterion ( @xmath47 ) is similar to that used in observations , but the scatter is high , and reasonable changes may lead to substructure in the range of @xmath48 .",
    "the difference between different cosmologies is significant and a measure of the mean matter density of the universe . among the models studied , @xmath23cdm shows the smallest percentage , and scdm2 the highest percentage of subclustering .",
    "we recommend the cumulative distribution of the delta - deviation as a natural quantifier of substructure .",
    "the differences in its distribution requires large catalogues of galaxy clusters , each with about 50 redshift measurements . on the other hand",
    ", it is shown that subclustering is a typical property of cluster formation in hierarchical theories of structure formation . in recent hydrodynamical simulations , a high percentage of substructure ( in 4 of 10 clusters )",
    "were found in a low density @xmath23cdm model ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , quantifying substructure with a distribution function of a substructure indicator , as done here with dark matter simulations , seems to be a prerequisite for discriminating cosmological models .",
    "we suspect this is a general characteristic for different substructure indicators .",
    "we compared the velocity kinematics as an indicator for subclusters with the subgroups found as friends - of - friends groups with half of the linking length .",
    "there is a weak correlation , i.e. , both statistics define similar structures , but there is large scatter . on the one hand , projection effects influence the delta - deviation , and on the other hand , high values of the delta - deviation can be produced by small groups with separate velocity kinematics .",
    "these effects are often stronger than the differences between different cosmological scenarios",
    ". this may be the reason for the large differences in the literature on the amount of substructure in galaxy clusters .",
    "it was shown that the delta - deviation is most sensitive to recent big mergers , and that big mergers are more typical for the high mass clusters .",
    "furthermore , they occur more often in high - density than in low - density models ."
