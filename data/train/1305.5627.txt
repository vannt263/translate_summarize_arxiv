    "recently , @xmath3 electron materials containing actinide elements have drawn considerable interest , stimulated by observations of intriguingly ordered ground states forming at low temperatures .",
    "a striking example is the formation of the hidden order phase in uru@xmath0si@xmath0 , where the origin of the arising low - temperature electronic order could not unambiguously be disclosed even after a quarter century ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "high - rank multipoles have been proposed recently as possible candidates for the order parameter in the hidden order phase.@xcite another example is the ordered ground state of npo@xmath0 , which , after many years could experimentally be established to be due to a high - rank multipolar order , in the absence of any dipolar moment formation.@xcite the richness of @xmath2 electron physics can be attributed to their multiple degrees of freedom where entangled spin and orbital moments may occur , activated through the strong spin - orbit ( s - o ) interaction in the actinide elements as well as on - site coulomb interactions .",
    "these conditions are in particular met in the actinide dioxides , which have provided a treasure trove of a rich variety of multi - orbital physics over many years.@xcite    the actinide dioxides crystallize in the cubic fluorite structure , yet , the ground - state properties of the actinide dioxides are intriguingly diverse .",
    "the current knowledge of their ordered ground states stipulates that in uo@xmath0 transverse 3@xmath4 magnetic dipolar and 3@xmath4 electric quadrupolar order is realized;@xcite npo@xmath0 is characterized by a 3@xmath4 ordered magnetic multipole of a high rank , in the absence of any dipole moment formation .",
    "@xcite amo@xmath0 undergoes a conspicuous phase transition at around 8.5  k.@xcite while a peak structure in the magnetic susceptibility was found,@xcite neutron - diffraction measurements could not detected antiferromagnetic order in agreement with the mssbauer measurement.@xcite puo@xmath0 is a simple nonmagnetic insulator,@xcite whereas cmo@xmath0 has an unexpected paramagnetic moment .",
    "@xcite surprisingly , each of these actinide dioxides is an insulator , in spite of the very different emerging orders and physical properties .",
    "this suggests that in these dioxides different gap - formation mechanisms are in fact operative .",
    "the origin of gap formation can only restrictedly be established through experiments .",
    "conversely , first - principles electronic structure calculations are well suited to study the gap formation mechanisms in relation to the unusually ordered states , but only a few such first - principles calculations , accounting for multipolar order states have been performed.@xcite a framework of first - principles calculations allows for a description of the bulk properties even if the investigated system contains some localized @xmath3 electrons in an open shell . however , it is known that the localized character of @xmath3 electrons is not reproduced with the basic approximations employed in first - principles calculations , like the local density approximation ( lda ) or generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) in which the two - body correlation between electrons in the open shell is not captured sufficiently .",
    "it was actually reported that the lda approach led to states that are inconsistent with the cef ground states determined experimentally in the ano@xmath0.@xcite moreover , the calculations predicted metallic ground states  @xcite whereas the ano@xmath0 compounds with light actinides are known to be large gap semi - conductors or insulators with energy gaps around 2 ev.@xcite therefore , first - principles calculations taking into account the strong coulomb interaction have been applied and have provided insight in the detailed magnetic and electronic character of uo@xmath0 ,  @xcite of npo@xmath0 ,  @xcite and of puo@xmath0 ,  @xcite although the @xmath3 characters provided in some of these calculations are different from those of the experimental ground states , especially for the ordered states . as taking strong electron correlations into account is necessary to obtain the energy gap in the first - principles calculations , the insulating ground states of ano@xmath0 are referred to as mott insulators .",
    "@xcite thus , to appropriately describe the ground states in the ano@xmath0 compounds , it is imperative to include the effects of strong coulomb interaction , strong spin - orbit coupling , and the multiorbital character of the @xmath3 electrons on equal footing . in this paper , we perform such first - principles calculations , focusing particularly on the mechanisms of insulating gap formation .",
    "we show that the insulating mechanisms differ substantially from one ano@xmath0 compound to another , depending on the involved @xmath3 states in ano@xmath0 .    the lda+@xmath1 method with s - o interaction included has been successful in capturing the ground state properties of @xmath3-electron compounds .",
    "@xcite in spite of some limitations this method is especially suited to describe the local character of @xmath3 electrons on the same footing with the electronic band description . moreover , there are two specific properties of the lda+@xmath1 framework that make it suitable to study complex ordered phases in the ano@xmath0 : the spin - orbital dependence of the local potential , which is essential since appearing order parameters involve multiple spin and orbital degrees of freedom , and the ability to take into account noncollinearity of local order parameters , because the multipole moments on each an site can be expressed through the local potential only.@xcite here we have adopted the lda+@xmath1 method with spin - orbit interaction , combined with the framework of the full - potential linearized augmented plane wave ( flapw ) band - structure method . since a large coulomb @xmath1 tends to increase the anisotropic character of the @xmath3 states , the full - potential treatment is an important ingredient , too , to adequately reproduce the @xmath3 states in the ano@xmath0 .    in the following ,",
