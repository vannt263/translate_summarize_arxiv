    "the nature and the masses of the neutrinos has not yet been established phenomenologically @xcite .",
    "the problem of the neutrino mass scale can be solved only by combining the neutrino oscillation data with the phenomenology of neutrinoless double - beta decay ( @xmath6 decay ) .",
    "the observed fluxes of solar neutrinos are much reduced compared with theoretical predictions based on the standard solar model ( ssm ) .",
    "it has been confirmed in different solar - neutrino experiments : homestake @xcite , kamiokande @xcite , sage @xcite , gallex @xcite , and super - kamiokande @xcite .",
    "recently announced result by the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) has shown clear indication of neutrino oscillation @xcite , i.e. , of beyond standard model physics . in particular , there is a strong evidence that @xmath7 from the sun are converted to @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "the great challenge of solar - neutrino research is to make accurate measurements of neutrinos with energy less than 1 mev .",
    "we remind that more than 98% of the calculated solar - neutrino flux lies in this energy region .",
    "especially , the @xmath10 neutrinos represent the dominant mode of neutrino emission from the sun .",
    "it is worthwhile to notice that the prediction of the @xmath10 neutrino flux is almost solar - model independent .",
    "new generation of low threshold solar - neutrino experiments are in preparation ( borexino ) or under consideration ( genius , heron , hellaz , lens , moon , xmass ... ) . the measurements of the total flux , flavor content , energy spectrum , and time dependence of the fundamental neutrinos are planned by using advantage of detection both charged and neutral weak currents as well as of the neutrino - electron scattering .    in the framework of some of future experiments ( genius , moon , xmass ) simultaneous spectroscopic studies of the @xmath6 decay and study of low energy solar neutrinos will be performed . in the moon detector with 10 tons of @xmath1 solar neutrinos",
    "are proposed to be detected by inverse @xmath11 decay @xcite .",
    "we note that @xmath1 is suitable for charge current registration of solar neutrinos due to low threshold of @xmath12 , what allows observation of low energy @xmath10 neutrinos .    in this contribution",
    "we analyze the possibility of detection of solar neutrinos via neutrino - induced double - beta process ( @xmath0-process ) of @xmath1 .",
    "we note that the @xmath0 process induced by neutrinos was discussed for the first time in connection with detection of reactor neutrinos and artificial sources in refs .",
    "@xcite . here , we present the predictions for the solar neutrinos absorption rates by assuming the standard solar model and different neutrino oscillation scenarios .",
    "the subject of our interest is also the background coming from the two - neutrino double - beta decay of @xmath1 in registration of solar neutrinos of different origin .",
    "finally , new modes of induced @xmath0 process , @xmath2 and @xmath3 channels , are introduced and discussed .",
    "the neutrino induced double - beta transition ( induced @xmath0 transition ) @xcite , @xmath13 is a reaction allowed within the standard model .",
    "it is a second order process in the weak interaction , observation of which by the help of reactor - neutrino flux has been found possible due to resonant enhancement of the corresponding amplitude depending on the width of the intermediate nuclear state @xcite .",

    "we note that the dominant contribution to the cross - section comes from the transitions through the real states of the intermediate nucleus ( @xmath46 ) and that contribution of transitions through virtual intermediate states ( like in @xmath41 decay ) is negligible ( suppressed by factor @xmath47 ) .",
    "next , we introduce the partial width @xmath48 of @xmath32-th state of the intermediate nucleus associated with the @xmath49 transition to the ground state of final nucleus .",
