    "this contribution is devoted to the memory of wolfgang kummer who untimely left us in 2007 .",
    "we collaborated with him several years beginning , in 1996 , by studying gravity induced on the worldvolume of a brane @xcite ; this was one of the pre - rundall - sundrum brane world scenarios ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "search for its supersymmetric generalizations led us to thinking on a new form of d@xmath0-brane actions @xcite and to studying the super - d@xmath3-brane dynamics @xcite .",
    "this line was then continued by attacking the problem of supersymmetric lagrangian description of the interacting superbrane systems @xcite which , in my opinion , still remains open as far as the commonly accepted candidate action for coincident dp ",
    "branes@xcite does not possess neither supersymmetry nor lorentz symmetry .    among the main tools in our studies",
    "were embedding and superembedding approaches to bosonic and supersymmetric branes .",
    "this is why i decided to chose for my contribution the present manuscript containing a review of the superembedding approach and its specific application for the case of superstring in @xmath1 superspace ( see @xcite for green  schwarz superstring action in this superspace ) .",
    "notice that superstring in @xmath1 superspace is often called _",
    "@xmath1 superstring _ ( see @xcite and refs therein ) .",
    "however , in our opinion , this name might produce an erroneous impression that the model is essentially different from the green  schwarz ( gs ) superstring .",
    "such a confusion might be further enlarged by an accent which is made in the literature on the fact that @xmath1 superspace ( the superspace with bosonic body @xmath1 ) is a coset of @xmath4 supergroup .",
    "although important , this does not change the fact that this @xmath5 superstring _ is just a particular case of the gs superstring in a curved superspace @xcite_. so is its type iia counterpart , @xmath6 superstring , which attracted recently much attention , but is not a model on a coset of supergroup , just because the type iia supergravity superspace with the bosonic body @xmath6 is not a coset @xcite .",
    "thus we prefer to formulate our problem as superembedding description of the gs superstring model in @xmath5 superspace .",
    "on one hand , this formalism can be applied to study the n=16 two dimensional supergravity induced on the worldsheet superspace of the superstring moving in ads superspace . and , in this respect",
    ", it is proper for the present volume because two dimensional gravity and supergravity model were always in the center of wolfgang s interests , see _ e.g._@xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", the results of this manuscript can be useful in further study of classical and quantum @xmath1 superstring , which is of current interest for the applications of ads / cft correspondence .",
    "superstring was used to reveal the mysterious dual superconformal symmetry of the n=4 sym amplitudes . ]",
    "the standard gs superstring action@xcite is based on embedding of a bosonic surface @xmath7 in the target superspace @xmath8 ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 for heterotic and type i and @xmath11 for type ii superstrings ) .",
    "this embedding is described by the bosonic and fermionic coordinate functions @xmath12 where p@xmath131 and @xmath14 are local coordinates on @xmath7 .",
    "the more ` ancient ' ramond  neveu  schwarz ( rns ) or spinning string , which becomes equivalent to the gs sigma model on the quantum level and after imposing the so  called gso projection ( see , however , @xcite and more recent @xcite ) , corresponds to an embedding of the worldsheet superspace @xmath15 into the spacetime @xmath16 , described by d bosonic superfields @xmath17 depending on two bosonic ( @xmath18 ) and complex fermionic coordinate @xmath19 ( or real fermionic coordinate in the case of heterotic string ) .",
    "there are some known obstacles for extending such a description to supermembrane and other branes@xcite .    following @xcite , the _ superembedding approach _ ,",
    "developed in @xcite for 10d superstrings and 11d supermembrane , and applied in the first studies of dynamics of dirichlet @xmath0-branes ( d@xmath0branes ) and m - theory 5-brane ( m5-brane ) in seminal papers @xcite and @xcite , describes strings and branes by _ embedding of a worldvolume superspace @xmath20 into the target superspace @xmath8_.    let us denote the @xmath21 local bosonic coordinates and @xmath22 fermionic coordinates of @xmath20 by @xmath23 .",

    "hence , in these cases , the description of the classical super-@xmath0-brane dynamics by this equation is complete .",
    "moreover , if several types of @xmath54dimensional p - branes exist , the superembedding equation provides their universal description ( see @xcite for such a universal description of fundamental type iib superstring and d1brane and @xcite for the @xmath55 covariant formulation providing a unified descriptions of all the actions of p  branes related to the d@xmath0-brane by sl(2 ) transformations ) .    on the other hand , this on - shell nature of the superembedding equation prevents from the constructing the complete worldvolume superfield action of the stv type ( see @xcite and @xcite for the review and further references ) . a universal although non - standard lagrangian framework for the superembedding approach is provided by the generalized action principle , proposed in @xcite for superstrings and @xmath56 supermembrane and in @xcite for the case of super - d@xmath0-branes .",

    "these _ moving frame variables _ or lorentz harmonics ( vector harmonics ) will be the subject of the next section .",
    "the standard formulations of superstring @xcite , m2-brane ( supermembrane ) @xcite and super-@xmath0-branes @xcite is based on embedding ( [ w0ins ] ) of the bosonic worldvolume @xmath60 into the tangent superspace @xmath8 .",
    "if the worldvolume @xmath60 is flat , one always can chose a special lorentz frame with @xmath61 vectors being tangential and the remaining @xmath62 vectors - orthogonal to @xmath60 .",

    "this is tantamount to saying that there exist @xmath59 linear combinations of @xmath67 that vanish on @xmath60 .",
    "we can express the above statement by the following _ embedding equation _",
    "@xmath68 where @xmath69 are some coefficient dependent on the point of @xmath60 .",
