    "e.g. _ , by ziman @xcite and arnold _ et al .",
    "we can view the right hand side of eq .",
    "( trans2 ) as a linear operator , the so - called collision operator @xmath115 , acting on the function @xmath116 ; we drop the implicit @xmath117 dependence because @xmath118 is independent of @xmath5 .",
    "a key property of @xmath118 is that it is hermitian with respect to the natural inner product @xmath119this hermiticity follows @xcite from symmetry properties of @xmath106 and @xmath107 under exchanges between incoming and outgoing momenta , which are very similar to those used in establishing boltzmann s h - theorem .",
    "the translational invariance of the system immediately implies the presence of a zero mode of the operator @xmath123 , which corresponds to the shift of the distribution functions arising from changing to a linearly moving reference frame .",
    "the corresponding deviation @xmath124 has the form [ zeromode ] g_(k,)=c()_tr(k)c ( ) k , which is easily seen to annihilate the left hand side of ( [ trans2 ] ) due to momentum conservation .",
    "note that this zero mode of the boltzmann operator is orthogonal to any modes of the form ( [ phsym ] ) which are the only ones that can be excited by an electric field at particle hole symmetry .",
    "this again expresses the fact that current and momentum are independent of each other at this special point .",
    "however , away from the dirac point , or if a thermal gradient is applied instead of an electric field , the zero mode @xmath125 will be excited by the driving field which leads to a diverging d.c .",
    "response in clean systems . this will be discussed in more detail in a forthcoming publication .    for the following we restrict to electrical conductivity at the particle - hole symmetric point where the above zero mode is irrelevant .      in the previous analysis of a quantum boltzmann equation for massless dirac fermions in two dimensions @xcite , it was noted that the phase space for scattering of particles was logarithmically divergent in the collinear limit .",
    "for the interaction considered in that paper , the collinear scattering cross - section vanished , and so this singular phase space density had no important consequences .",
    "the collinear scattering does not vanish for the present coulomb interaction , and so we need to consider this logarithmic divergence seriously .",
    "the physical origin of the divergent collinear scattering is related to the linear dispersion which implies that quasiparticles or -holes moving in the same direction share the same group velocity , independent of their energies .",
    "this leads to a diverging duration of collisions of nearly collinear particles , which is enhanced due to the low space dimensionality . to the extent that collinear scattering is very strong , and",
    "if we consider small enough frequencies , we may expect that quasiparticles and holes that move in the same direction in the plane will establish a pseudo - equilibrium characterized by an effective chemical potential and an effective temperature which will however depend on the direction of motion .",
    "in linear response the deviations of these effective parameters from the equilibrium values @xmath81 and @xmath1 have to vary with @xmath126 for symmetry reasons . further",
    ", the effective temperature shift is easily shown to be identical to the mode @xmath125 discussed above , and thus , it is thus ruled out at the particle hole symmetric point @xmath87 .",
    "the remaining dominant mode of the function @xmath88 will correspond to an effective shift in chemical potential which translates into [ psimu ] g_(k,)= c ( ) _ ( k ) c ( ) , where the prefactor has been chosen so as to make @xmath127 dimensionless . with this ansatz , which will be confirmed below",
    ", it simply remains to determine the prefactor @xmath127 , yielding the leading term in the non - equilibrium distribution .",
    "note that the effective chemical potential shift ranges between @xmath128 depending on the direction .",
    "comparing this to the temperature allows us to estimate the threshold electric field strength , @xmath129 , below which non - linear effects should remain small .",
    "going beyond the collinear limit , we conclude that there is an eigenvalue of @xmath118 which is not proportional to @xmath156 in the limit of small @xmath157 ; the corresponding eigenvector is given by a constant @xmath158 up to corrections of order @xmath159^{-1}$ ] .",
