    "the name chemotaxis refers to the motion of organisms induced by chemical signals @xcite . in some cases ,",
    "the biological organisms ( bacteria , amoebae , endothelial cells , ants ... ) secrete a substance ( pheromone , smell , food , ... ) that has an attractive effect on the organisms themselves .",
    "therefore , in addition to their diffusive motion , they move preferentially along the gradient of concentration of the chemical they secrete ( chemotactic flux ) .",
    "when attraction prevails over diffusion , the chemotaxis can trigger a self - accelerating process until a point at which aggregation takes place .",
    "this is the case for the slime mold _ dictyostelium discoideum _ and for the bacteria _",
    "escherichia coli_. this is referred to as chemotactic collapse .",
    "a model of slime mold aggregation has been introduced by patlak @xcite and keller & segel @xcite in the form of two coupled differential equations .",
    "the first equation is a drift - diffusion equation describing the evolution of the concentration of bacteria and the second equation is a diffusion equation with terms of source and degradation describing the evolution of the concentration of the chemical . in the simplest model ,",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath0 and the mobility @xmath1 of the bacteria are constant .",
    "this forms the standard keller - segel model .",
    "however , the original keller - segel model allows these coefficients to depend on the concentration of the bacteria and of the chemical .",
    "if we assume that they only depend on the concentration of the bacteria , the general keller - segel model becomes similar to a nonlinear mean field fokker - planck equation .",
    "nonlinear fokker - planck ( nfp ) equations have been introduced in a very different context , in relation with a notion of generalized thermodynamics @xcite . as far as we know",
    ", the connection between the general keller - segel model and nonlinear mean field fokker - planck equations has been first mentioned in chavanis @xcite and developed in subsequent papers ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this analogy makes possible to interpret results obtained in chemotaxis in terms of a generalized thermodynamics . at the same time",
    ", chemotaxis becomes an example of great physical importance for which a notion of ( effective ) generalized thermodynamics is justified .",
    "the standard keller - segel ( ks ) model has been extensively studied in the mathematical literature ( see the review by horstmann @xcite ) . it was found early that , above a critical mass , the distribution of bacteria becomes unstable and collapses . this _",
    "_ leads ultimately to the formation of dirac peaks @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown by chavanis , rosier & sire @xcite that , when the equation for the evolution of the concentration is approximated by a poisson equation @xcite , the standard keller - segel ( ks ) model is isomorphic to the smoluchowski - poisson ( sp ) system describing self - gravitating brownian particles .",
    "the chemotactic collapse of biological populations above a critical mass is equivalent to the _ gravitational collapse _ of self - gravitating brownian particles below a critical temperature @xcite . assuming that the evolution is spherically symmetric , chavanis & sire @xcite were able to describe all the phases of the collapse ( pre - collapse and post - collapse ) _ analytically _ in @xmath2 dimensions , including the critical dimension @xmath3 .",
    "recently , some authors have considered generalizations of the standard keller - segel ( ks ) model .",
    "two main classes of generalized keller - segel ( gks ) models of chemotaxis have been introduced :    _ ( i ) models with filling factor : _ hillen & painter @xcite considered a model with a normal diffusion and a density - dependent mobility @xmath4 vanishing above a maximum density @xmath5 .",
    "the same model was introduced independently by chavanis @xcite in relation with an `` exclusion principle '' connected to the fermi - dirac entropy in physical space . in these models ,",
    "the density of bacteria remains always bounded by the maximum density : @xmath6 .",
    "this takes into account finite size effects and filling factors . indeed ,",
    "since the cells have a finite size , they can not be compressed indefinitely . in this generalized keller - segel model ,",
    "chemotactic collapse leads ultimately to the formation of a _ smooth aggregate _ instead of a _",
    "dirac peak _ in the standard keller - segel model .",
    "this regularized model prevents finite time - blow up and the formation of ( unphysical ) singularities like infinite density profiles and dirac peaks .",
    "therefore , the dirac peaks ( singularities ) are replaced by smooth density profiles ( aggregates ) .    _",
    "( ii ) models with anomalous diffusion : _ chavanis & sire @xcite studied a model with a constant mobility and a power law diffusion coefficient @xmath7 ( with @xmath8 ) .",

    "the system reaches a self - confined distribution similar to a stable polytrope ( e.g. a classical white dwarf star ) in astrophysics . for @xmath10 ,",
    "the system undergoes chemotactic collapse above a critical mass ( the classical chemotactic collapse related to the standard keller - segel model is recovered for @xmath11 ) @xcite . in the pre - collapse regime ,",
    "the evolution is self - similar and leads to a finite time singularity .",
    "a dirac peak is formed in the post - collapse regime . for @xmath12 ,",
    "the dynamics is peculiar and involves a critical mass similar to the chandrasekhar limiting mass of relativistic white dwarf stars in astrophysics @xcite .",

    "logotropes_.    in the present paper , we discuss a larger class of generalized keller - segel models and interprete these equations in relation with nonlinear mean field fokker - planck equations and generalized thermodynamics . for illustration ,",
    "we present for the first time a model incorpoating both a filling factor and some effects of anomalous diffusion .",
    "the general keller - segel model @xcite describing the chemotaxis of bacterial populations consists in two coupled differential equations @xmath15 @xmath16 that govern the evolution of the density of bacteria @xmath17 and the evolution of the secreted chemical @xmath18 .",
    "the bacteria diffuse with a diffusion coefficient @xmath19 and they also move in a direction of a positive gradient of the chemical ( chemotactic drift ) . the coefficient @xmath20 is a measure of the strength of the influence of the chemical gradient on the flow of bacteria . on the other hand ,",

    "this is an heuristic approach to take into account microscopic constraints that affect the dynamics of the particles at small scales and lead to non - boltzmannian distributions at equilibrium .",

    "as discussed previously , the generalized keller - segel model ( [ dyn3 ] ) can be viewed as a nonlinear fokker - planck equation where the diffusion coefficient and the mobility explicitly depend on the local concentration of particles .",
    "such generalized fokker - planck equations can be derived from a kinetic theory , starting from the master equation , and assuming that the probabilities of transition explicitly depend on the occupation number ( concentration ) of the initial and arrival states .",
    "below , we briefly summarize and adapt to the present situation the approach developed by kaniadakis @xcite in a more general context .",

    "this can account for microscopic constraints like close - packing effects that can inhibitate the transition .",
    "quite generally , the evolution of the density satisfies the master equation @xmath155 assuming that the evolution is sufficiently slow , and local , such that the dynamics only permits values of @xmath156 close to @xmath150 , one can develop the term in brackets in eq .",
