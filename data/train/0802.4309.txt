    "filling and weak interactions there is a critical rotation frequency at which the ground and first excited states are the symmetric and anti - symmetric superposition states of opposite circulation .",
    "their energy difference decreases exponentially with increasing number of particles @xcite .",
    "this makes it hard to observe this effect even in systems with small numbers of particles . on the other hand , superpositions of macroscopically distinct flow",
    "have been observed in experiments with superconducting quantum interference devices ( squid ) @xcite .",
    "this motivates the second part of this paper , where we point out that for a slightly non - uniform lattice the energy gap scales less severely with the number of particles @xcite .",
    "finally , we discuss how one can probe cat - like correlations via many - body oscillations induced by a sudden change in the rotation frequency and show that different quasi - momentum states can be distinguished in time - of - flight absorption images @xcite .",
    "we note that there are related articles on the quantum dynamics of a vortex in a bose gas @xcite and topological winding in a 1d bec @xcite .",
    "optical ring lattices can be created experimentally by interfering a laguerre - gaussian ( lg ) laser beam with a plane wave co - propagating along the @xmath0-direction @xcite . by reflecting the combined beam back on itself",
    ", one can achieve confinement along the @xmath0-direction , thus creating an stacked array of disk shaped traps . by controlling the tunneling between the disks and making it much smaller than the corresponding tunneling within each ring",
    ", one can implement an array of effective 1d ring lattices .",
    "the lattices can be rotated by introducing a phase shift in one the two beams that compose the interference pattern .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath1 ultracold bosons with mass @xmath2 confined in a 1d ring lattice of @xmath3 sites with lattice constant @xmath4 .",
    "the ring is rotated in its plane ( about the @xmath0-axis ) with angular velocity @xmath5 . in the rotating frame of the ring",

    "assuming that the lattice is deep enough to restrict tunneling between nearest - neighbor sites and the band gap is larger than the rotational energy , the bosonic field operator @xmath12 can be expanded in wannier orbitals confined to the first band @xmath13 with @xmath14 w_j(\\mathbf{x})$ ] . here , @xmath15 are the wannier orbitals of the stationary lattice centered at the site @xmath16 , @xmath17 an effective vector potential and @xmath18 the bosonic annihilation operator of a particle at site @xmath16 . in terms of these quantities , the many - body hamiltonian can be written , up to on - site diagonal terms which we neglect for simplicity , as @xcite @xmath19 here , @xmath20 is the number operator at site @xmath16 , @xmath21 is the effective phase twist induced by the gauge field , @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the hopping energy between nearest - neighbour sites @xmath16 and @xmath24 : @xmath25 w_{j+1}$ ] , and @xmath26 the on - site interaction energy : @xmath27 .",
    "we start our discussion with the case of a uniform ring lattice , i.e.  @xmath28 for all @xmath16 . to understand the effect of rotation on the ground state properties of atoms in a rotating ring lattice , it is convenient to write the many - body hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) in terms of the quasi - momentum operators @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the discrete quasi - momentum and @xmath31 is an integer , @xmath32 . in this basis",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) reads @xmath33 where @xmath34 $ ] are single - particle energies and the notation @xmath35 indicates modulo @xmath3 .",
    "the modulus is taken because in collision processes the quasi - momentum is conserved up to an integer multiple of the reciprocal lattice vector @xmath36 , i.e.  modulo umklapp processes .",
    "we begin by considering the non - interacting limit , @xmath37 . while in a static ring , @xmath38",
    ", the ground state corresponds to all @xmath1 atoms in the @xmath39 quasi - momentum state , in a rotating ring the ground state acquires a finite quasi - momentum , @xmath40 , to lower the energy gained by rotation . in other words",
    "it becomes a current carrying state . if one writes @xmath41 with @xmath42 an integer and @xmath43 , @xmath44 if @xmath45 and @xmath46 if @xmath47 . the quantum number @xmath48 can also be viewed as the winding number , which measures the circulation or `` vorticity '' of the gas : at the critical angular velocity @xmath49 , ( i.e. @xmath50 ) , the winding number increases by one unit .    in general , for @xmath51 , the ground state is unique and corresponds to a macroscopically occupied state with well defined quasi - momentum : @xmath44 and @xmath46 for @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "however , the fact that exactly at the critical frequency , @xmath54 , the single particle energies @xmath55 and @xmath56 become degenerate leads to a @xmath57fold degenerate many - body ground state .",
    "the @xmath58 degenerate energy levels correspond to the states with @xmath59 atoms in @xmath60 and @xmath61 atoms in @xmath62 , with @xmath63 .",
    "we denote such states as @xmath64 .    in the presence of interactions ,",
    "one expects the degeneracy to be lifted . for weak interactions ,",
    "i.e.  @xmath65 , one can use lowest - order perturbation theory to account for their effect . in view of the absence of direct coupling between the different @xmath66 states ,",
    "the energy shifts are diagonal and given by @xmath67 $ ] . therefore ,",
    "in lowest order of perturbation theory , the states with minimal energy become those corresponding to @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "these two states remain degenerate and higher - order perturbation theory is needed to break the degeneracy . at this point",
    "one has to distinguish whether the number of atoms @xmath1 is commensurate ( co ) or incommensurate ( ico ) with the number of lattice sites @xmath3 .    in the ico case , there is no coupling between @xmath70 and @xmath71 and therefore , these states remain degenerate for all values of @xmath26 . in the co system , on the other hand , there are many different paths that couple these two states , and the number of paths increases exponentially with @xmath1 and @xmath3",
    ". the absence of coupling in the ico case can be intuitively understood by considering the total quasi - momentum @xmath72 .",
    "the many - body hamiltonian ( [ momehat ] ) exhibits a block diagonal form if the quasi - momentum fock states are ordered according to @xmath73 . in the co case , @xmath74 with @xmath59 an integer , the states @xmath70 and @xmath71 have total quasi - momentum @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively , and thus both of them belong to the @xmath77 block . on the other hand , in the ico case , @xmath78 , and hence the two states @xmath70 and @xmath71 , belong to different blocks as @xmath79 . thus these two states are not coupled by interaction .    in the co case",
    ", we construct an effective @xmath80 hamiltonian by projecting on the subspace spanned by the two macroscopic states @xmath70 and @xmath71 @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 is the number density .",
    "the @xmath84 are transition matrix elements introduced by the interaction term of the hamiltonian @xmath85 ; and @xmath86 are either @xmath87 or non - interacting many - body eigenenergies depending upon whether the intermediate states are or are not in the @xmath88 manifold .",
    "the factor @xmath89 corresponds to the minimum number of collision processes necessary to connect the states @xmath70 and @xmath71 and the sum is over all the different paths that generate such couplings . at the critical rotation frequency",
    "we have @xmath90 and due to the non - zero value of @xmath91 the symmetric and anti - symmetric superpositions @xmath92 become the ground and first excited state separated from each other by an energy gap @xmath93 @xmath94",
    "in the previous section we found that for a uniform ring lattice the coupling @xmath91 between the two macroscopic states scales exponentially with increasing number of particles @xmath1 ( see eq .",
    "( [ gap ] ) ) , and that the cat state ( [ cat ] ) only appears in the co case . in this section",
    "we explore whether the situation can be improved by introducing a lattice modulation , i.e.  we generalize our discussion to ring superlattices where @xmath28 for @xmath16 even and @xmath95 for @xmath16 odd .",
    "due to the superlattice potential the quasi - momentum states @xmath96 and @xmath97 are coupled and the single - particle hamiltonian is no longer diagonal in the quasi - momentum basis . via a unitary basis transformation @xmath98 with @xmath99 we diagonalize the single - particle hamiltonian @xmath100 where the single - particle energies are given by @xmath101 the single - particle spectrum ( [ spspectrum ] ) contains a degeneracy at the critical phase twist @xmath102 even the presence of the superlattice potential , i.e.  we have @xmath103 , but note that for @xmath104 these states are not the ground states of the system .    following similar arguments as in the previous section",
    "we will show that weak on - site interactions lift the degeneracy at @xmath105 and lead to the formation of strongly - correlated states in the many - body system . in the absence of interactions @xmath106 the ground state of a bosonic",
    "many - body system is the state with all bosons occupying the lowest - energy single - particle state . at the critical phase twist @xmath102 the single - particle spectrum has , however , a twofold degeneracy , so that there is a @xmath58-dimensional degenerate subspace at @xmath1-particle level . a convenient basis for this subspace is given by the fock states @xmath88 with @xmath107 , where @xmath59 particles are in the single - particle state of energy @xmath108 and @xmath61 particles in the one of energy @xmath109 , respectively . for weak interactions @xmath110 this subspace is the low - energy sector of the many - body problem for all phase twists @xmath21 and tunneling strength ratios @xmath111 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian in first order of the on - site interaction strength @xmath26 is @xmath112 where @xmath113 are the number operators and the parameter @xmath114 simplifies for @xmath105 to @xmath115 . at the critical phase twist @xmath102 the terms in the first bracket",
    "are an unimportant zero - energy offset , whereas the terms in the second bracket shift the energies of the states in the subspace differently , e.g.  they lead to an energy difference of @xmath116 between the states @xmath117 and @xmath118 , while the states @xmath119 and @xmath120 remain pairwise degenerate .",
    "the terms in the third bracket are off - diagonal in the fock basis of the subspace and describe two - particle scattering between the two single - particle modes .",
    "they lift the remaining pairwise degeneracies in the many - body spectrum .",

    "we calculate the total coupling through intermediate states using perturbation theory . after eliminating the intermediate states we obtain , up to a constant energy shift which we neglect , the following @xmath80 hamiltonian @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the energy difference between the states @xmath117 and @xmath123 caused by the detuning of the phase twist from resonance @xmath126 , i.e. @xmath127 and @xmath91 is the coupling between the states @xmath117 and @xmath123 due to the off - diagonal terms of the effective hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) . as the latter only directly couples the states @xmath88 and @xmath128 , the first non - vanishing order is given by @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the diagonal interaction energy shift .    in order to understand the influence of the superlattice potential on the formation of the cat state , we show in fig .",

    "they introduce four efficient coupling paths involving only @xmath142 scattering processes and the intermediate state @xmath140 lies in the degenerate subspace .    let us compare our results for the coupling @xmath91 in the case of a uniform ring lattice ( [ gap ] ) with the case of a ring superlattice ( [ gap2 ] ) . in both cases the coupling @xmath91 decreases exponentially with",
    "the number of particles @xmath1 .",
    "this is because multiple two - particle scattering processes are the microscopic origin of the coupling @xmath91 and transitions between the two configurations @xmath117 and @xmath123 are thus highly off - resonant @xmath143-th and @xmath144-th order processes , respectively .",
    "consequently , the energy gap vanishes in the thermodynamic limit @xmath145 and cat state production both in uniform and slightly non - uniform ring lattices is restricted to modest numbers of atoms . however , as the energy gap in first non - vanishing order is proportional to @xmath146 for slightly non - uniform rings as compared to @xmath147 for uniform rings , it can be one order of magnitude bigger in the relevant parameter regime .",
