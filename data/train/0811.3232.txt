    "alice  @xcite is the dedicated heavy - ion experiment at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the main physics goal of the experiment is the study of strongly - interacting matter in the conditions of high energy density ( @xmath0 ) and high temperature ( @xmath1 ) , expected to be reached in central collisions at @xmath2 . under these conditions , according to lattice qcd calculations , quark confinement into colourless hadrons should be removed and a deconfined quark ",
    "gluon plasma should be formed  @xcite .",
    "heavy - flavour particles are regarded as effective probes of the system conditions . in particular :    * open charm and beauty hadrons would be sensitive to the energy density , through the mechanism of in - medium energy loss of heavy quarks ; * quarkonium states would be sensitive to the initial temperature of the system through their dissociation due to colour screening .",
    "the expected @xmath3 and @xmath4 production yields for pp collisions at @xmath5 are 0.16 and 0.0072 , respectively  @xcite . for the 5% most central pb ",
    "pb collisions at @xmath2 the expected yields are 115 and 4.6 , respectively . these numbers , assumed as the baseline for alice simulation studies , are obtained from pqcd calculations at nlo  @xcite , including the nuclear modification of the parton distribution functions in the pb nucleus .",
    "note that the predicted yields have large uncertainties , of about a factor 2 , estimated by varying the values of the calculation parameters .",
    "experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) have shown that the nuclear modification factor of particles @xmath6 distributions , , is a sensitive observable for the study of the interaction of the hard partons with the medium produced in nucleus  nucleus collisions .",
    "heavy quark medium - induced quenching is one of the most captivating topics to be addressed in collisions at the lhc . due to the qcd nature of parton energy loss , quarks",
    "are predicted to lose less energy than gluons ( that have a higher colour charge ) and , in addition , the ` dead - cone effect ' is expected to reduce the energy loss of massive quarks with respect to light partons  @xcite .",
    "therefore , one should observe a pattern of gradually decreasing @xmath7 suppression when going from the mostly gluon - originated light - flavour hadrons ( @xmath8 or @xmath9 ) to d and to b mesons : @xmath10 .",
    "the measurement of d and b meson production cross sections will also serve as a baseline for the study of medium effects on quarkonia .",
    "two of the most interesting items in the quarkonia sector at the lhc will be : ( a ) understanding the interplay between colour - screening - induced ( and medium - temperature - dependent ) suppression and statistical regeneration for j/@xmath11 production in a medium containing on the order of 100 @xmath3 pairs ; ( b ) measuring for the first time medium effects on the bottomonia resonances , expected to be affected by colour - screening only if the temperature of the medium will be larger than about 0.4  gev .",
    "the alice experimental setup , described in detail in  @xcite , allows the detection of open charm and beauty hadrons and of quarkonia in the high - multiplicity environment of central  collisions at lhc energy , where a few thousand charged particles might be produced per unit of rapidity .",
    "the heavy - flavour capability of the alice detector is provided by :    * tracking system ; the inner tracking system ( its ) , the time projection chamber ( tpc ) and the transition radiation detector ( trd ) , embedded in a magnetic field of @xmath12  t , allow track reconstruction in the pseudorapidity range @xmath13 with a momentum resolution better than 2% for @xmath14 and a transverse impact parameter , is defined as the distance of closest approach of the track to the interaction vertex , in the plane transverse to the beam direction . ]",
    "resolution better than @xmath15 for @xmath16 ( the two innermost layers of the its , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , are equipped with silicon pixel detectors ) .",
    "* particle identification system ; charged hadrons are separated via @xmath19 in the tpc and via time - of - flight measurement in the time of flight ( tof ) detector ; electrons are separated from charged hadrons in the dedicated transition radiation detector ( trd ) , and in the tpc ; muons are identified in the muon spectrometer covering the pseudo - rapidity range @xmath20 .",
    "simulation studies  @xcite have shown that alice has good potential to carry out a rich heavy - flavour physics programme .",
    "the main analyses in preparation are :    * open charm ( section  [ open ] ) : fully reconstructed hadronic decays @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 ( under study ) , @xmath24 ( under study ) in @xmath25 . * open beauty ( section  [ open ] ) : inclusive single leptons @xmath26 in @xmath25 and @xmath27 in @xmath20 ; inclusive displaced charmonia @xmath28 ( under study ) .",
    "* quarkonia ( section  [ quarkonia ] ) : @xmath29 ( j/@xmath11 , @xmath30 ) and @xmath31 ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) states in the @xmath35 ( @xmath25 ) and @xmath36 ( @xmath20 ) channels .    for all simulation studies , a multiplicity @xmath37@xmath38 was assumed for central collisions . in the following ,",
    "we report the results corresponding to the expected statistics collected by alice per lhc year : @xmath39 central ( 05% @xmath40 ) events at @xmath41 and @xmath42 pp events at @xmath43 , in the barrel detectors ; the forward muon arm will collect about 40 times larger samples of muon - trigger events ( i.e. @xmath44 central events ) .",

    "errors corresponding to the centre of the prediction bands for massive quarks are shown : bars = statistical , shaded area = systematic.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=47.0% ]    among the most promising channels for open charm detection are the @xmath21 ( @xmath45 , branching ratio @xmath46 ) and @xmath22 ( @xmath47 , branching ratio @xmath48 ) decays . the detection strategy to cope with the large combinatorial background from the underlying event",
    "is based on the selection of displaced - vertex topologies , i.e. separation from the primary vertex of the tracks from the secondary vertex and good alignment between the reconstructed d meson momentum and flight - line  @xcite .",
    "an invariant - mass analysis is used to extract the raw signal yield , to be then corrected for selection and reconstruction efficiency and for detector acceptance .",
    "the accessible @xmath6 range for the @xmath49 is @xmath50@xmath51 in and @xmath12@xmath51 in pp , with statistical errors better than 1520% at high @xmath6 .",
    "similar capability is expected for the @xmath52 .",
    "the systematic errors ( acceptance and efficiency corrections , centrality selection for pb ",
    "pb ) are expected to be smaller than 20% .",
    "the production of open beauty can be studied by detecting the semi - electronic decays of beauty hadrons , mostly b mesons .",
    "such decays have a branching ratio of @xmath53 .",
    "the main sources of background electrons are : decays of d mesons ; @xmath9 dalitz decays and decays of light vector mesons ( e.g.@xmath54 and @xmath55 ) ; conversions of photons in the beam pipe or in the inner detector layer ; pions misidentified as electrons . given that electrons from beauty have average impact parameter @xmath56 and a hard @xmath6 spectrum , it is possible to obtain a high - purity sample with a strategy that relies on : electron identification with a combined @xmath19 ( tpc ) and transition radiation ( trd ) selection ; impact parameter cut to reduce the charm - decay component and reject misidentified @xmath57 and @xmath58 from dalitz decays and @xmath59 conversions . as an example , with @xmath39 central events , this strategy is expected to allow the measurement of electron - level @xmath6-differential cross section in the range @xmath60 with statistical errors smaller than 15% at high @xmath6 .",
    "similar performance figures are expected for pp collisions .",
    "b production in pp and collisions can be measured also in the alice muon spectrometer ( @xmath20 ) analyzing the single - muon @xmath6 distribution  @xcite .",
    "the main backgrounds to the ` beauty muon ' signal are @xmath57 , @xmath61 and charm decays .",
    "the cut @xmath62 is applied to all reconstructed muons in order to increase the signal - to - background ratio .",
    "then , a fit technique allows to extract a @xmath6 distribution of muons from b decays .",
    "since only minimal cuts are applied , the statistical errors are expected to be smaller than 5% up to muon @xmath63 .",
    "we investigated the possibility of using the described charm and beauty measurements to study the high-@xmath6 suppression induced by parton energy loss .",
    "the sensitivity to @xmath64 and @xmath65 is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : raa ] .",
    "predictions  @xcite with and without the effect of the heavy - quark mass , for a medium transport coefficient @xmath66 ( a measurement of the medium density ) in the range @xmath67@xmath68 , are also shown .",
    "alice can detect quarkonia in the dielectron channel at central rapidity ( @xmath69 ) and in the dimuon channel at forward rapidity ( @xmath70 ) . in both channels",
    "the quarkonia acceptance extends down to zero transverse momentum , since the minimum @xmath6 for e and @xmath71 identification is about @xmath72 .",
    "the high @xmath6 reach is expected to be 10  ( 20 )  @xmath73 for the j/@xmath11 in @xmath74 ( @xmath36 ) , for a run of one month at nominal luminosity . in the bottomonium sector , the mass resolution of about @xmath75 at @xmath76 , for both dielectrons and dimuons , should allow the separation of the @xmath32 and @xmath33 states , and thus the measurement of the @xmath77 ratio , which is expected to be sensitive to the initial temperature of the medium .",
    "simulation studies are in progress to prepare a measurement of the fraction of j/@xmath11 that feed - down from b decays .",
    "such measurement can be performed by studying the separation of the dilepton pairs in the j/@xmath11 invariant mass region from the main interaction vertex .",
    "the analysis is also expected to provide a measurement of the beauty @xmath6-differential cross section .",
    "heavy quarks , abundantly produced at lhc energies , will allow to address several issues at the heart of in heavy - ion physics . they provide tools to probe the density ( via parton energy loss and its predicted mass dependence ) and the temperature ( via the dissociation patterns of quarkonia ) of the high - density qcd medium formed in collisions .",
    "the excellent tracking , vertexing and particle identification performance of alice will allow to fully explore this rich phenomenology ."
