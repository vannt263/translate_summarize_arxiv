    "if a @xmath5-ray burst ( grb ) originate within a galactic disk then the large deposition of energy will result in a blast wave whose initial phase produces the afterglow .",
    "the late phase of the blast wave evolution would result , as noted by @xcite in the context of supernova remnants ( snrs ) , in a cool expanding hi  shell .",
    "the shell will remain distinct from its surrounding until it has slowed down to a velocity of @xmath6 .",
    "this would happen within @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the initial energy in units of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the current rate of grbs is one per @xmath9 per galaxy @xcite .",
    "this leads us to expect a few remnants per galaxy at any given time .",
    "however sn are @xmath10 times more frequent and it would be difficult to distinguish between a snr and a grb remnant . today there is mounting evidence that some grbs are beamed @xcite . beamed grbs will illuminate only a fraction @xmath11 of the sky , and their rate should be higher by a factor of @xmath12 .",
    "with @xmath13 we would expect a hundred grb remnants per galaxy . at an early stage the morphology of",
    "a `` jetted '' grb remnant would be very different from a spherical explosion .",
    "this can be used to identify those remnants .",
    "we study this phase here .    both beamed grbs and sn deposit a comparable ( @xmath14 ) energy into the ism . in both cases the evolution",
    "is expected to be similar since both are in the sedov @xcite regime where all the energy is the initial explosion energy and all the mass is in the surrounding ism .",
    "a key distinguishing feature unique to grb remnants could be their beamed nature which we expect would lead to a distinct double shell morphology at intermediate times ( the late time behavior of the grb remnant is expected to be spherical in any case ) . in order to establish how many hi  shells are grb remnants we must find out the expected morphology of grb remnants and how long they remain non - spherical , and distinguishable from snrs .",
    "expanding hi  shells have been found in many spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "the interior of these shells is relatively empty and their current expansion velocity is in the order of tens of km s@xmath15 .",
    "models for the origin of these hi  supershels involve a large number of spatially correlated supernova events @xcite , infall of massive gas clouds on to the galactic plane @xcite and flaring of radio lobes formed by jets ejected from the galactic nucleus during an active phase @xcite .",
    "it has been previously noted @xcite that a subset of these hi  supershells may be the late signature left by grbs on the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "establishing how many of the hi  shells are grb remnants would make it possible to directly estimate the local rate of grbs , determine @xmath16 , the efficiency of converting the explosion energy into @xmath5-rays , and the beaming factor @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "we model the intermediate evolution of a beamed grb by two blobs of dense material moving into the ism in opposite directions and we follow numerically their hydrodynamical evolution . our results can be rescaled to fit a variety of initial energies .",
    "we find that at a time of @xmath17 , when the ratio @xmath18 between the accumulated mass , @xmath19 , and the initial grb energy,@xmath20 , reaches @xmath21 the remnant becomes spherical , similar in shape to a snr .",
    "this value is independent of the exact initial details of our model such as the opening angle , the velocity and the morphology .",
    "we compare our results to the hi  shells dem l316  @xcite previously classified as two colliding snrs . as the accumulated mass",
    "there is much larger it is most likely not a grb remnant .",
    "we describe our model and the numerical methods in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we describe our results .",
    "discussion and summary including a comparison with dem l316  are given in section 4 .",
    "we study the intermediate evolution of the relativistic ejecta that caused a grb .",
    "we assume that this matter was ejected in the form of two ultra relativistic blobs moving in opposite directions with a bulk lorenz factor @xmath22 .",
    "the emission from internal collisions in the blobs during an early stage comprises the grb .",
    "late external shocks caused by collisions with circumstellar matter produce the afterglow .",
    "the matter slows down during this interaction and its bulk lorenz factor @xmath23 , decreases .",
    "the ejecta stays collimated only until @xmath23 drops below @xmath24 , at approximately @xmath25 after the grb , when it has accumulated @xmath26 of ism mass @xcite where @xmath27 is the initial angular width , @xmath28 the isotropic energy in units of @xmath0 and @xmath29 is the surrounding ism density in units of @xmath30 .",
    "note that in the rest of the paper @xmath8 denotes the _ actual _ energy in units of @xmath0 . at this time",
    "the matter will start to expand sideways causing , for an adiabatic evolution , an exponential slowing down @xcite .",
    "the ejecta continues to expand sideways at an almost constant radial distance from the source @xmath31 until it becomes non - relativistic . at this stage , we begin our simulation .    without a detailed numerical modeling of the relativistic phase of the ejecta",
    "we have only an approximate description of how to construct the initial conditions .",
    "we expect the angular width of the ejecta to be @xmath32 .",
    "additionally we are constrained by newtonian energy conservation which yields a relation between @xmath33 , @xmath23 and @xmath20 : @xmath34 the exact shape and energy distribution of the ejecta are uncertain .",
    "this may influence the numerical coefficient in eq .",
    "( [ eq : const ] ) .",
    "however we show that the intermediate and late evolution of the ejecta are insensitive to these uncertainties in the initial conditions .",
    "this is due to the fact that since we are in the sedov regime , the mass is dominated by the `` external '' ism gas which washes out any variations in the initial conditions of the ejecta .",
    "this same mechanism will smear out any non - spherical features in a sn explosion , producing spherical snrs .",
    "we realize these initial conditions by two identical blobs moving in opposing directions into the ism .",
    "the computational space is a cylinder in which the blobs move along the symmetry axis .",
    "both the blobs and the ism are modeled by a cold @xmath35 ideal gas .",
    "the blobs are denser than the ism .",
    "we consider various initial densities , angular widths and shapes of the blobs in order to make sure that these are indeed unimportant in determining the final morphology . in all",
    "runs @xmath36 . to evolve these initial conditions we use a hydrodynamic code , neglecting radiative effects .",
    "we note that we have also used the post newtonian version of our code with the same initial blob velocity of @xmath37 .",
    "we found that the blobs slow down rapidly and the results were similar to the newtonian results . within a few timesteps we have a newtonian system .",
    "in essence this is equivalent to slightly changing the initial shape of the blobs which , as noted before , is insignificant due to the mass dominance of the ism .",
    "the code we use is based on the newtonian version of the smooth particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code introduced in @xcite .",
    "the code was adapted for the specific problem at hand .",
    "the three computationally important features of the problem are the negligible role of gravity , the large amount of stationary gas representing the ism , and the symmetry .",
    "the fact that gravity is unimportant has made the equations very simple and greatly increased the speed of the code . implementing single particle time steps allowed us to put in a large volume of stationary gas without making a big impact on the computational time .",
    "this way most of the computational effort is invested in the `` important '' interacting particles .",
    "typically only 0.1% of the particles actually move during each timestep .",
    "the initial conditions are set up so that the blobs are on the @xmath38 axis with a velocity along the @xmath38 axis . with these initial conditions",
    "there is a rotational symmetry about the @xmath38 axis and a reflection symmetry about the @xmath39 plane .",
    "we implement the reflection symmetry exactly and the rotation symmetry only approximately .",
    "the implementation , similar to @xcite , consists of considering only @xmath40 ( one quadrant ) of the computational volume and adding reflecting boundary conditions on the three inner boundaries defined by the @xmath39 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 planes .",
    "we implement no outer boundary condition since the surrounding gas is very cold and there is almost no pressure so the outer particles gain only a negligible velocity throughout the course of the simulation .",
    "the quadrant we evolve consists of 62,800 sph particles of which only @xmath43 represent the initial blob , again stressing the total mass dominance of the ism .",
    "the reflecting boundary conditions are implemented using pseudo - particles . at the beginning of each timesteps , all particles which intersect one of the boundaries ( in sph each particle has a finite size called the smoothing length ) are reflected about this boundary and added to the simulation as additional pseudo - particles .",
    "after this is done for all reflecting boundaries , we calculate all the time derivatives in the usual manner treating all particles in an equal way .",
    "when all time derivatives are calculated we delete all the pseudo - particles . only the `` real '' particles are then advanced in time .",
    "this simple algorithm allows us to implement reflecting boundary conditions using only a small number ( typically 10% of the total number of particles for the three boundaries we use ) of additional particles .",
    "the use of sph requires adding some artificial viscosity in order to resolve shocks .",
    "we use the standard artificial viscosity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) consisting of a term analogous to bulk viscosity and a von neuman - richtmyer artificial viscosity term .",
    "for the time integration we used a second order runge - kutta integrator with an adaptive stepsize control .",
    "we choose the initial velocity to be in the range @xmath44 to @xmath45 , making relativistic effects small .",
    "equation ( [ eq : const ] ) leaves the freedom of choosing two out of the three parameters @xmath20 , @xmath33 and @xmath29 , the initial energy , distance and ism density respectively . in presenting the results we choose @xmath20 and @xmath46 . to parameterize the evolution of the remnant we utilize the fact that mass scales linearly with the initial energy and we define the dimensionless parameter @xmath47 where @xmath19 is the accumulated shell mass .",
    "we define @xmath19 as all mass with density above @xmath48 corresponding to the shocked material of the shell and to the accumulated ism mass .",
    "all subsequent results are presented as functions of @xmath49 .",
    "our simulation begins approximately 2 years after the burst , when @xmath50 . in figure",
    "[ fig : mu ] , we show the linear scaling of time with @xmath49 .",
    "the scaling relation is @xmath51 which is close to the sedov - taylor @xcite blast wave result of @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the radius of the blast wave .    a bow shock forms as each blob collides with the ism .",
    "the shock also propagates in the direction perpendicular to the blob s velocity and over time , backwards .",
    "the expected morphology of the remnant will therefore be of two expanding shells which will eventually join , producing yet another shock . at late times",
    "the shells will merge and become a single spherical shell .",
    "we made several runs , differing in the initial density , shape , initial velocity , angular width and the numerical coefficient in eq .",
    "( [ eq : const ] ) of the ejecta as summarized in table  [ tab : runs ] . in five runs",
    "the initial ejecta was shaped like a disk and in one case it was shaped like a sphere . as we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : posall ] , for @xmath54 the @xmath38 positions of the shock and its maximal radius in the @xmath39 plane , @xmath55 are indeed unaffected by these variations in initial conditions .",
    "the @xmath49 at which the shells touch depends on the exact initial conditions , but all other events ( such as the @xmath49 at which the remnant becomes spherical ) are unaffected . therefore in the following discussions we will consider only one of the runs .",
    "the mass inside the shell , defined as all mass with density below @xmath56 also evolves almost linearly with @xmath49 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] ) as @xmath57 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dens_cont ] , we show the density contours as a function of @xmath49 .",
    "the two shells touch and a shock forms along the equatorial plane between them at @xmath58 when @xmath59 depending on the initial conditions .",
    "the maximal @xmath38 position of the shock and @xmath55 can be fitted with a power law as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pos ] .",
    "the scaling relation for @xmath55 is @xmath60 .",
    "the effective radius of the shell , @xmath61 , scales as @xmath62 , exactly the result expected for a sedov - taylor blast wave .",
    "the ratio @xmath63 decreases in time staying always between 1 and 2 ( see fig  [ fig : ratio ] ) . extrapolating we see that this ratio reaches a value of 1 at @xmath64 . at this time",
    "the shock has a spherical shape with @xmath65 .",
    "even then the shock will not be completely spherically symmetric as there would still be a ring of shocks around the `` equator '' where the shells have collided .    during the whole run ,",
    "total energy is conserved to within 1% . in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy ] we show @xmath66 the total kinetic energy in the @xmath38 direction , @xmath67 the total kinetic energy in the @xmath39 plane and @xmath68 the total internal energy in the simulated volume .",
    "as the blobs interact with the ism @xmath68 and @xmath67 increase at the expense of @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath67 increases until @xmath69 and then it remains constant at @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath68 increases by a factor of 200 to a value of @xmath71 , most of the increase occurs before @xmath72 . in the final configuration ( @xmath73 ) 72% of the energy is in internal energy , 22% is in kinetic energy in the @xmath39 plane and only 6% remains in the kinetic energy in the @xmath38 direction",
    ".    figures [ fig : images_brem ] and [ fig : images_sync ] depict the images of the remnant as a function of time and angles of inclination .",
    "we show images due to bremsstrahlung emission and synchrotron emission .",
    "the images are constructed assuming that all the gas is optically thin in the relevant frequencies . the bremsstrahlung luminosity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : images_brem ] ) was calculated assuming that the volume emissivity is proportional to @xmath74 @xcite . in calculating the synchrotron emissivity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : images_sync ] ) we assumed that both the magnetic field energy density and the energy of the relativistic electrons are proportional to the internal energy density of the gas with the proportionality factors @xmath75 and @xmath76 respectively .",
    "we further assume that the relativistic electron number density is a power law in energy . under these assumptions",
    "the volume emissivity is proportional to @xmath77 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in the late images there are two bright circles at the lines where the colliding blobs forming a hot shocked region .",
    "we follow the hydrodynamic evolution of two blobs colliding with the ism . this scenario is a model for the intermediate time behavior of matter ejected from a central engine producing a grb .",
    "our results can be rescaled to fit a variety of initial energies and ism densities .",
    "the two shells touch and a shock forms along the equatorial plane between them at @xmath78 when @xmath79 .",
    "we show that the late time remnant is insensitive to the exact initial morphology , angular width and density of the ejecta .",
    "although initially the remnant may be highly non - spherical , the ratio between its height and radius will approach unity and it will eventually become spherical in shape after a time of @xmath80 when @xmath81 .",
    "after this time it will be difficult to distinguish a grb remnant from a snr using the morphology .",
    "the expected number of non - spherical grb remnants is , therefore , @xmath82 per galaxy ( using the observed present grb rate @xcite of @xmath83 ) .",
    "the results of @xcite show a tendency for the bilateral axis of the non - spherical snrs to be aligned with the galactic plane .",
    "this presents strong evidence in favor of an extrinsic model for the origin of non - spherical snrs . using our results",
    ", we can propose an alternative explanation to the origin of some of the highly non - spherical snrs and hi   shells . instead of assuming an _ extrinsic _ model , namely spherical energy deposition into a non isotropic medium we propose an _ intrinsic _ model : non spherical energy deposition into an isotropic medium .",
    "our grb remnant model can explain non - spherical snrs with a two shell morphology provided that @xmath84 .",
    "one extreme and well studied case , the non - spherical snr dem l316  @xcite , has a distinct double shell morphology .",
    "the external model clearly fails here .",
    "however the ratio @xmath49 measured for dem l316  is @xmath85 and a a grb remnant would already be spherical at this stage , suggesting that dem l316   is not a grb remnant .",
    "this conclusion could be revised if for some reason the initial blobs stay confined for a much longer period ( so that eq .",
    "1 is not satisfied ) or if the solution becomes radiative before becoming spherical and the radiative cooling slow down the evolution .",
