    "adelina georgescu founded romai , the romanian society of applied and industrial mathematics in 1992 and i met her in 1993 in oradea , at the first conference on applied and industrial mathematics caim .",
    "she was a severe woman , strongly dominant .",
    "we got closer in february 2007 , when she asked me which are my mathematical interests -the asynchronous systems- and i asked her which are her mathematical interests -the dynamical systems .",
    "i realized instantly that the two theories may interact , the first one made on @xmath2 functions , the second one made on @xmath3 functions , since the reasoning in asynchronous systems is often made by following analogies with the real numbers concepts and the dynamical systems looked to be a real source of inspiration in the sense of creating analogies .",
    "i told her my thoughts and in the months that followed i received from her by mail many books in dynamical systems written by herself and by her phd students . in august that year , near athens , i presented at a wseas plenary lecture my first work in asynchronous systems considered as boolean dynamical systems .",
    "i was deeply impressed by the evolution of her disease and by her disappearance .",
    "she has encouraged me to continue studying the asynchronous systems , a direction of research that is not popular , she published my papers , she gave me suggestions of research and consistent bibliography .",
    "she will always remain a model for us , those that had the chance to meet her , with her idealism , with her wish to construct and with her disappointments , with her strength and with her fragility .",
    "it is a tender pleasure for me to dedicate to her memory this paper , that is a direct consequence of our friendship .",
    "the mathematical theory of modeling the asynchronous circuits from electrical engineering has developed in the 50 s and the 60 s under the name of switching theory .",
    "afterwards the mathematicians seem to have lost their interest in this field ( or maybe their studies continue , under an unpublished form ) and their work was continued by the engineers .",
    "this situation has generated great theoretical needs in time . in 2007 when our book asynchronous systems theory was published the bibliography was poor , consisting mainly in engineering works that give intuition and we were not sure which msc it should have , due to its distance from the general accepted directions of mathematical research .",
    "the asynchronous systems theory is a well known syntagm to the engineers , however the mathematicians do not know it .",
    "professor valeriu prepelita helped in this sense by suggesting , as reviewer , * 93 - 02 research monographs ( systems and control ) , 93a05 axiomatic system theory and 93a10 general systems .",
    "we have adopted in this paper 94c10 switching theory , application of boolean algebra , with the remark that this is a modern point of view of what has been done 50 years ago in switching theory .    since 2007",
    "our efforts were those of taking the old - newborn asynchronous systems theory away from its isolation and making it socialize with the existing systems theory .",
    "the @xmath2 functions give the deterministic function . ]",
    "real time - binary models of the digital electrical signals and they are not studied in literature . an asynchronous circuit without input , considered as a collection of @xmath4 signals , should be deterministically modelled by a function @xmath5 called state .",
    "we have however several parameters related with the asynchronous circuit that are either unknown , or perhaps variable or simply ignored in modeling such as the temperature , the tension of the mains and the delays the occur in the computation of the boolean functions .",
    "for this reason , instead of a function @xmath6 we have in general a set @xmath7 of functions @xmath8 called state space , or non - deterministic functions or , equivalently , that each circuit is modeled by several functions @xmath9 autonomous asynchronous system , where each function @xmath6 represents a possibility of modeling the circuit .",
    "when @xmath7 is constructed by making use of a vector field @xmath10 the system @xmath7 is called regular .",
    "the universal regular autonomous asynchronous systems are the boolean dynamical systems and they can be identified with @xmath11 .",
    "the dynamic of these systems is described by the so called state portraits .",
    "for example in figure [ attractive3 ] we have the function @xmath12    [ ptb ]    attractive3.jpg    that is defined by the formula @xmath13 and the arrows show the increase of time . for any @xmath14",
    "the coordinate @xmath15 is underlined if @xmath16 and it is called unstable , or enabled , or excited in this case .",
    "the coordinates @xmath15 that are not underlined satisfy by definition @xmath17 and are called stable , or disabled , or not excited .",
    "three arrows start from the point @xmath18 where both coordinates are unstable , showing the fact that @xmath19 may be computed first , @xmath20 may be computed first or @xmath21 may be computed simultaneously .",
    "note that the two possibilities of defining the system , state portrait and formula , are equivalent .",
    "note also that the system was identified with the function @xmath11 .",
    "the existence of several possibilities of evolution of the system ( three possibilities in @xmath18 ) is the key characteristic of asynchronicity , as opposed to synchronicity where the coordinates @xmath22 are always computed simultaneously , @xmath23 for all @xmath24 and the system s run is : @xmath25    our prezent aim is to show how the well known concepts of @xmath1limit set , invariance and basin of attraction from the dynamical systems theory , by real to binary translation , create asynchronous meanings .",
    "the set @xmath26 is the binary boole algebra , endowed with the usual algebraical laws and with the discrete topology .",

    "the functions @xmath37 of the form @xmath33@xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are called * progressive * and their set is denoted by @xmath41    let be the function @xmath42 i ) for @xmath43 we define @xmath44 by @xmath45 @xmath46 we have denoted with @xmath47 the modulo 2 sum .",

    "we have assumed that @xmath56 is like at ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "\\iv ) the set @xmath57is also called * orbit * ( of @xmath58 ) .",
    "the function @xmath59 shows how an asynchronous iteration of @xmath11 is made : for any @xmath60 if @xmath61",
    "then @xmath62 is not computed , since @xmath63 and if @xmath64 then @xmath62 is computed , since @xmath65    the definition of @xmath66 generalizes this idea to an arbitrary number @xmath67 of asynchronous iterations , with the supplementary request that each coordinate @xmath62 is computed infinitely many times in the sequence @xmath68 whenever @xmath69    the sequences @xmath40 make the pass from the discrete time @xmath70 to the continuous time @xmath71 and each @xmath56 shows , in addition to @xmath39 , the time instants @xmath72 when @xmath11 is computed ( asynchronously ) .",

    "if @xmath84 is computed , ...    when @xmath85 runs in @xmath86 and @xmath87 runs in @xmath35 we get the unbounded delay model of computation of the boolean function @xmath11 , represented in discrete time by the sequences @xmath88 and in continuous time by the orbits @xmath89 respectively .",
    "we shall not insist on the non - formalized way that the engineers describe this model ; we just mention that the unbounded delay model is a reasonable way of starting the analysis of a circuit in which the delays occurring in the computation of the boolean functions @xmath11 are arbitrary positive numbers .",
    "if we restrict suitably the ranges of @xmath85 and @xmath87 we get the bounded delay model of computation of @xmath11 and if both @xmath90 , @xmath87 are fixed , then we obtain the fixed delay model of computation of @xmath91 determinism .",

    "we interpret stability as invariance and stating that @xmath347 or @xmath457 is stable and attractive means that it is invariant and a weaker property than invariance takes place ( see theorem [ the106 ] ) and finally asymptotic stability means invariance too .",
    "in @xcite , page 132 the statement is made that many times , in applications , by stability is understood attractiveness .",

    "we have the definition of the basin of attraction from @xcite , page 27 : the maximal set attracted by an attractor @xmath424 ( invariant set , attractive for one of its neighborhoods ) is called the kingdom of attraction of @xmath347 ; when the kingdom of attraction is an open set , it is called basin of attraction .",
    "we conclude , related with the real to binary translation of this definition , that if @xmath283 is p - invariant , then it is p - attractive for itself and thus an attractor ; its basin of attraction @xmath386 is non - empty in this case and it is the maximal set attracted by @xmath347 .",
    "we note that the stable manifold of the equilibrium point @xmath456 is defined in @xcite , page 4 and @xcite , page 93 for the dynamical system @xmath447 by @xmath474 in @xcite , page 46 the terminology of stable set is used for this concept and @xcite mentions this terminology too .",
