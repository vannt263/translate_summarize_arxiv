    "in the standard model , @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing is suppressed both by the glashow - iliopoulos - maiani mechanism  @xcite and by cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix elements  @xcite , although sizeable mixing could arise from new physics  @xcite .",
    "charm mixing is conventionally described by two small dimensionless parameters : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the masses and widths , respectively , of the neutral @xmath22 meson @xmath23 eigenstates , @xmath24 ( @xmath23-odd ) and @xmath25 ( @xmath23-even ) , which are defined as follows : latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }     assuming @xmath23 conservation .",
    "the mixing probability is then denoted by @xmath12 , and the width of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 flavor eigenstates is @xmath27 .    by focusing on @xmath0 decay times ,",
    "recent experiments have made precise measurements of @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing parameters  @xcite that highlight the need for information on the relative phase between the cabibbo - favored decay @xmath28 and the doubly cabibbo - suppressed ( dcs ) decay @xmath29 .",
    "direct measurements of @xmath4 come from comparing decay times in @xmath30 to those in @xmath0 transitions to the @xmath23-even eigenstates @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "time - dependent studies of the resonant substructure in @xmath33 provide @xmath3 as well as @xmath4 .",
    "in contrast , an indirect measure of @xmath4 is provided by the `` wrong - sign '' process @xmath6 , where interference between the dcs amplitude and the mixing amplitude manifests itself in the @xmath0 decay time distributions .",
    "these analyses are sensitive to @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the relative phase between the dcs amplitude and the corresponding cabibbo - favored @xmath7 amplitude : @xmath36 .",
    "we adopt a convention in which @xmath5 corresponds to a strong phase , which vanishes in the su(3 ) limit  @xcite .",
    "the magnitude @xmath37 of the amplitude ratio is approximately 0.06 .",
    "measurements of @xmath4 and @xmath38 have both attained a precision of @xmath39 . however , because @xmath5 has not previously been measured , these separate determinations of @xmath4 and @xmath38 have not been directly comparable .",
    "thus , even a modest measurement of @xmath5 can significantly improve the overall knowledge of charm mixing parameters .    in this article ,",
    "we present a first determination of @xmath5 that takes advantage of the correlated production of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons in @xmath10 collisions produced at the cornell electron storage ring and collected with the cleo - c detector .",
    "if a collision produces no accompanying particles , the @xmath8 pair is in a quantum - coherent @xmath40 state .",
    "because the initial state ( the virtual photon ) has @xmath41 , there follows a set of selection rules for the decays of the @xmath0 and @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "for example , both @xmath0 and @xmath1 can not decay to @xmath23 eigenstates with the same eigenvalue .",
    "on the other hand , decays to @xmath23 eigenstates of opposite eigenvalue are enhanced by a factor of two .",
    "more generally , final states that can be reached by both @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( such as @xmath42 ) are subject to similar interference effects . as a result ,",
    "the effective @xmath0 branching fractions in this @xmath8 system differ from those measured in isolated @xmath0 mesons .",
    "moreover , using time - independent rate measurements , it becomes possible to probe @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing as well as the relative strong phases between @xmath0 and @xmath1 decay amplitudes to any given final state .",
    "we implement the method described in ref .",
    "@xcite for measuring @xmath4 and @xmath5 using quantum correlations at the @xmath2 resonance .",
    "our experimental technique is an extension of the double tagging method previously used to determine absolute hadronic @xmath22-meson branching fractions at cleo - c  @xcite .",
    "this method combines yields of fully reconstructed single tags ( st ) , which are individually reconstructed @xmath0 or @xmath1 candidates , with yields of double tags ( dt ) , which are events where both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are reconstructed , to give absolute branching fractions without needing to know the luminosity or @xmath8 production cross section .",
    "given a set of measured yields , efficiencies , and background estimates , a least - squares fitter  @xcite extracts the number of @xmath8 pairs produced ( @xmath43 ) and the branching fractions ( @xmath44 ) of the reconstructed @xmath0 final states , while accounting for all statistical and systematic uncertainties and their correlations .",
    "we employ a modified version of this fitter that also determines @xmath4 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 using the following categories of reconstructed final states : @xmath42 ( @xmath49 ) , @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) , @xmath23-even ( @xmath52 ) and @xmath23-odd ( @xmath53 ) eigenstates , and semileptonic decays ( @xmath54 ) . with cleo - c measurements alone ,",
    "@xmath46 is not determined with sufficient precision to extract @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , we also incorporate measurements of branching fractions and mixing parameters from other cleo - c analyses or from external sources .",
    "we neglect @xmath23 violation in @xmath22 decays , which would entail a slight correction to the mixing signal .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : formalism ] , we review the formalism of quantum - correlated @xmath8 decay .",
    "section  [ sec : selection ] describes the event selection criteria and @xmath22 reconstruction procedures .",
    "the external measurements used in the fit are summarized in section  [ sec : externalmeas ] .",
    "systematic uncertainties , which are also input to the fit , are discussed in section  [ sec : systematics ] .",
    "finally , we present and discuss our main fit results in section  [ sec : results ] . in the appendix , we provide information for use by other experiments .",
    "to first order in @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the @xmath55-odd rate @xmath56 for @xmath8 decay to final state @xmath57 follows from the anti - symmetric amplitude @xmath58 : @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "these amplitudes are normalized such that @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .",
    "the total rate , @xmath65 , is the same as for uncorrelated decay , as are st rates .",
    "however , unlike the case of uncorrelated @xmath8 , we can consider the @xmath55-odd @xmath8 system as a @xmath66 pair . if only flavored final states are considered , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , then the effects of quantum correlations are negligible . in this analysis , we also include @xmath23 eigenstates , which brings additional sensitivity to @xmath4 and @xmath5 , as demonstrated below .",
    "quantum - correlated semileptonic rates probe @xmath4 because the decay width does not depend on the @xmath23 eigenvalue of the parent @xmath22 meson , as this weak decay is only sensitive to flavor content . however , the total width of the parent meson does depend on its @xmath23 eigenvalue : @xmath67{{\\scriptsize 1 } \\\\",
    "{ \\scriptsize 2}}}=\\gamma(1 \\mp y)$ ] , so the semileptonic branching fraction for @xmath24 or @xmath25 is modified by @xmath68 . if we reconstruct a semileptonic decay in the same event as a @xmath69 decay , then the semileptonic @xmath22 must be a @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , the effective quantum - correlated @xmath8 branching fractions ( @xmath70 ) for @xmath71 final states depend on @xmath4 : @xmath72 where the factor of 2 arises from the sum of @xmath73 and @xmath74 rates . combined with estimates of @xmath75 and @xmath76 from st yields , external sources , and flavor - tagged semileptonic yields",
    ", this equation allows @xmath4 to be determined .",
    "similarly , if we reconstruct a @xmath77 decay in the same event as a @xmath69 , then the @xmath42 was produced from a @xmath24 .",
    "the effective branching fraction for this dt process is therefore @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the wrong - sign rate ratio , which depends on @xmath3 and @xmath4 because of the interference between dcs and mixing transitions : @xmath80 . in an analogous fashion , we find @xmath81 .",
    "when combined with knowledge of @xmath82 , @xmath4 , and @xmath37 , the asymmetry between these two dt yields gives @xmath83 . in the absence of quantum correlations ,",
    "the effective branching fractions above would be @xmath84 .",
    "more concretely , we evaluate eq .",
    "( [ eq : rates ] ) with the above definitions of @xmath37 and @xmath5 to produce the expressions in table  [ tab : rates ] . in doing so",
    ", we use the fact that inclusive st rates are given by the incoherent branching fractions since each event contains one @xmath0 and one @xmath1 . comparison of @xmath70 with the uncorrelated effective branching fractions , @xmath85 , also given in table  [ tab : rates ] , allows us to extract @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath4 , @xmath45 , and @xmath48 .",
    "information on @xmath86 is obtained from st yields at the @xmath2 and from external measurements using incoherently produced @xmath0 mesons .",
