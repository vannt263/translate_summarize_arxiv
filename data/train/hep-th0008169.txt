    "low - energy structure of quantum supersymmetric field theories is described by the effective lagrangians of two types : chiral and general or holomorphic and non - holomorphic .",
    "non - holomorphic or general contributions to effective action are given by integrals over full superspace while holomorphic or chiral contributions are given by integrals over chiral subspace of superspace .",
    "as a result the effective action in low - energy limit is defined by the chiral superfield @xmath1 which is called holomorphic or chiral effective potential and real superfield @xmath2 which is called non - holomorphic or general effective potential .",
    "the specific feature of these potentials is that they do not depend on covariant derivatives of the superfields .",
    "we point out that a possibility of holomorphic corrections to effective action was firstly demonstrated in [ 1 ] ( see also [ 2 ] ) for n=1 susy and in [ 3 ] for n=2 susy .",
    "the modern interest to structure of low - energy effective action in extended supersymmetric theories was inspired by the seminal papers [ 4 ] where exact instanton contribution to holomorphic effective potential has been found for n=2 su(2 ) super yang - mills theory .",
    "these results have later been extended for various gauge groups and for coupling to matter ( see f.e . [ 5 ] ) .",
    "one can show that in generic n=2 susy models namely the holomorphic effective potential is leading low - energy contribution .",
    "non - holomorphic potential is next to leading correction . a detailed investigation of structure of low - energy effective action for various n=2 susy theories has been undertaken in [ 6 - 9 ] .",
    "a further study of quantum aspects of supersymmetric field models leads to problem of effective action in n=4 susy theories .",
    "these theories being maximally extended global supersymmetric models possess the remarkable properties on quantum level :    * n=4 super yang - mills model is finite quantum field theory , * n=4 super yang - mills model is superconformal invariant theory and hence , its effective action can not depend on any scale .",
    "these properties allow to analyze a general form of low - energy effective action and see that it changes drastically in compare with generic n=2 super yang - mills theories .",
    "analysis of structure of low - energy effective action in n=4 su(2 ) sym model spontaneously broken down to u(1 ) has been fulfilled in recent paper by dine and seiberg [ 10 ] .",
    "they have investigated a part of effective action depending on n=2 superfield strengths @xmath3 , @xmath4 and shown    * holomorphic quantum corrections are trivial in n=4 sym .",
    "therefore , namely non - holomorphic effective potential is leading low - energy contribution to effective action , * non - holomorphic effective potential @xmath5 can be found on the base of the properties of quantum n=4 sym theory up to a coefficient .",
    "all perturbative or non - perturbative corrections do not influence on functional form of @xmath5 and concern only this coefficient .    the approaches to direct calculation of non - holomorphic effective potential including the above coefficient have been developed in [ 11 - 13 ] , extensions for gauge group su(n ) spontaneously broken to maximal torus have been given in [ 15 - 17 ] ( see also [ 14 ] where some bosonic contributions to low - energy effective action have been found ) .",
    "as well known , the most powerful and adequate approach to investigate the quantum aspects of supersymmetric field theories is formulation of these theories in terms of unconstrained superfields carrying out a representation of the supersymmetry .",
    "unfortunately such a manifestly n=4 supersymmetric formulation for n=4 yang - mills theory is still unknown .",
    "a purpose of this paper is study a structure of low - energy effective action for n=4 sym as a functional of n=2 superfield strengths . in this case",
    "it is sufficient to realize the n=4 sym theory as a theory of n=2 unconstrained superfields .",
    "it is naturally achieved within harmonic superspace .",
    "the n=2 harmonic superspace [ 19 ] is the only manifestly n=2 supersymmetric formalism allowing to describe general n=2 supersymmetric field theories in terms of unconstrained n=2 superfields .",
    "this approach has been successfully applied to problem of effective action in various n=2 models in recent works [ 7 , 9 , 13 , 16 ] .    from point of view of n=2 susy ,",
    "the n=4 yang - mills theory describes interaction of n=2 vector multiplet with hypermultiplet in adjoint representation . within harmonic superspace approach ,",
    "the vector multiplet is realized by unconstrained analytic gauge superfield @xmath6 . as to hypermultiplet",
    ", it can be described either by a real unconstrained superfield @xmath7 ( @xmath7-hypermultiplet ) or by a complex unconstrained analytic superfield @xmath8 and its conjugate ( @xmath9-hypermultiplet ) . in the @xmath7-hypermultiplet realization ,",
    "the classical action of n=4 sym model has the form    @xmath10=\\frac{1}{2g^2}{\\rm tr}\\int d^4xd^4\\theta w^2- \\frac{1}{2g^2}{\\rm tr}\\int d\\zeta^{(-4)}\\nabla^{++}\\omega \\nabla^{++}\\omega \\eqno(1)%2.1\\ ] ] the first terms here is pure n=2 sym action and the second term is action @xmath7-hypermultiplet . in @xmath9-hypermultiplet realization , the action of the n=4 sym model looks like this    @xmath11= \\frac{1}{2g^2}{\\rm tr}\\int d^4xd^4\\theta w^2- \\frac{1}{2g^2}{\\rm tr}\\int d\\zeta^{(-4)}q^{+i}\\nabla^{++}q^+_i \\eqno(2)%2.2\\ ] ] where @xmath12 all other denotions are given in [ 19 ] .",
    "both models ( 1,2 ) are classically equivalent and manifestly n=2 supersymmetric by construction . however , as has been shown in [ 19 ] , both these models possess hidden n=2 supersymmetry and as a result they actually are n=4 supersymmetric .",
    "we study the effective action @xmath13 for n=4 sym with gauge group su(2 ) spontaneously broken down to u(1 ) .",
    "this effective action is considered as a functional of n=2 superfield strengths @xmath3 and @xmath14 .",
    "then holomorphic effective potential @xmath15 depends on chiral superfield @xmath3 and it is integrated over chiral subspace of n=2 superspace with the measure @xmath16 .",
    "non - holomorphic effective potential @xmath2 depends on both @xmath3 and @xmath17 .",
    "it is integrated over full n=2 superspace with the measure @xmath18 .",
    "let us begin with dimensional analysis of low - energy effective action .",
    "taking into account the mass dimensions of @xmath3 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and the superspace measures @xmath16 and @xmath18 ones write    @xmath21 where @xmath22 is some scale and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the dimensionless functions of their arguments . due to remarkable properties of n=4 sym in quantum domain ,",
    "the effective action is scale independent .",
    "therefore    @xmath25 first of eqs ( 5 ) leads to @xmath26 .",
    "second of eqs ( 5 ) reads    @xmath27 here @xmath28 is arbitrary chiral function of chiral superfield @xmath29 and @xmath30 is conjugate function .",
    "the integrals of @xmath28 and @xmath31 over full n=2 superspace vanish and eqs(5 ) takes place for any @xmath28 and @xmath30 . since @xmath26 the holomorphic effective potential @xmath19 is proportional to classical lagrangian @xmath32 .",
    "general solution to eq ( 6 ) is written as follows @xmath33 with arbitrary coefficient @xmath34 . as a result ,",
    "holomorphic effective potential is trivial in n=4 sym theory . therefore , namely non - holomorphic effective potential is leading low - energy quantum contribution to effective action .",
    "moreover , the non - holomorphic effective potential is found exactly up to coefficient and given by eq ( 7 ) [ 10 ] .",
    "any perturbative or non - perturbative quantum corrections are included into a single constant @xmath34 .",
    "however , this result immediately face the problems :    * is there exist a calculational procedure allowing to derive @xmath35 in form ( 7 ) within a model ? * what is value of @xmath34 ? if @xmath36 , the non - holomorphic effective potential vanishes and low - energy effective action in n=4 sym is defined by the terms in effective action depending on the covariant derivatives of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , * what is structure of non - holomorphic effective potential for the other then su(2 ) gauge groups ?",
    "the answers all these questions have been given in [ 11 - 17 ] .",
    "further we are going to discuss a general manifestly n=2 supersymmetric and gauge invariant procedure of deriving the non - holomorphic effective potential in one - loop approximation [ 13,16 ] .",
    "this procedure is based on the following points :    * formulation of n=4 sym theory in terms of n=2 unconstrained superfields in harmonic superspace [ 19 ] , * n=2 background field method [ 9 ] providing manifest gauge invariance on all steps of calculations , * identical transformation of path integral for effective action over n=2 superfields to path integral over some n=1 superfields .",
    "this point is nothing more then replacement of variables in path integral , * superfield proper - time technique ( see first of refs [ 2 ] ) which is manifestly covariant method for evaluating effective action in superfield theories .",
    "next section is devoted to some details of calculating non - holomorphic effective potential .",
    "we study effective action for the classically equivalent theories ( 1 , 2 ) within n=2 background field method [ 9 ] . we assume also that the gauge group of these theories is su(n ) . in accordance with background field method",
    "[ 9 ] , the one - loop effective action in both realizations of n=4 sym is given by    @xmath37=\\frac{i}{2 } { \\rm tr}_{(2,2 ) } \\log\\stackrel{\\frown}{\\box}-\\frac{i}{2}{\\rm tr}_{(4,0 ) } \\log\\stackrel{\\frown}{\\box } \\eqno(8)%4.1\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the analytic dalambertian introduced in [ 9 ] .",
    "@xmath39w+\\displaystyle\\frac{i}{2 } \\{\\bar{w},w\\ } \\end{array}\\eqno(9)%4.2\\ ] ] the formal definitions of the @xmath40 and @xmath41 are given in [ 13 ] .",
    "our purpose is finding of non - holomorphic effective potential @xmath5 where the constant superfields @xmath3 and @xmath17 belong to cartan subalgebra of the gauge group su(n ) .",
    "therefore , for calculation of @xmath5 it is sufficient to consider on - shell background    @xmath42 in this case the one - loop effective action ( 8) can be written in the form [ 13 ]    @xmath43 the superfield @xmath44 belonging to the adjoint representation looks like @xmath45 with @xmath46 be the harmonics [ 19 ] and @xmath47 satisfy the constraints @xmath48    the next step is transformation of the path integral ( 11 ) to one over unconstrained n=1 superfields .",
    "this point is treated as replacement of variables in path integral ( 11 ) .",
    "we introduce the n=1 projections of @xmath3 ( see the details in [ 13 , 16 ] ) . as a result one obtains    @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 are the supercovariant derivatives . here",
    "@xmath54 @xmath55 the operator ( 14 ) has been introduced in [ 16 ] .",
    "thus , we get a problem of effective action associated with n=1 operator ( 14 ) .",
    "such a problem can be investigated within n=1 superfield proper - time technique .",
    "application of this technique leads to lowest contribution to effective action in the form    @xmath56 where @xmath57 eqs",
    "( 13 , 16 , 17 ) define the non - holomorphic effective potential of n=4 sym theory in terms of n=1 projections of n=2 superfield strengths .",
    "the last step is restoration of n=2 form of effective action ( 16 ) .",
    "for this purpose we write contribution of non - holomorphic effective potential to effective action in terms of covariantly constant n=1 projections @xmath58 and @xmath59 @xmath60 comparison of eqs ( 17 ) and ( 18 ) leads to @xmath61 @xmath62 eq ( 19 ) is our final result . in partial case of su(2 ) group spontaneously broken down to u(1 ) eq ( 19 ) coincides with eq ( 7 ) where @xmath63 .",
    "eq ( 19 ) defines the non - holomorphic effective potential depending on n=2 superfield strengths for n=4 su(n ) super yang - mills theories . as a result we answered all the questions formulated in section 3",
    "first , we have presented the calculational procedure allowing to find non - holomorphic effective potential .",
    "second , we calculated the coefficient c in eq ( 7 ) for su(2 ) group .",
    "it is equal to @xmath64 .",
    "third , a structure of non - holomorphic effective potential for the gauge group su(n ) has been established .",
    "it is interesting to point out that the scale @xmath22 is absent when the non - holomorphic effective potential ( 19 ) is written in terms of n=1 projections of @xmath3 and @xmath14 ( see eqs ( 15 , 16 ) ) .",
    "therefore , the @xmath22 will be also absent if we write the non - holomorphic effective potential through the components fields .",
    "we need in @xmath22 only to present the final result in manifestly n=2 supersymmetric form .",
    "n=1 form of non - holomorphic effective potential ( 16 ) allows very easy to get leading bosonic component contribution .",
    "schematically it has the form @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is abelian strength constructed from vector component and @xmath67 is a scalar component of n=2 vector multiplet .",
    "it means that non - zero expectation value of scalar field @xmath67 plays a role of effective infrared regulator in n=4 sym theories .",
    "generalization of low - energy effective action considered in [ 10 - 17 ] and containing all powers of constant @xmath66 has recently been constructed in [ 19 ] in terms of n=2 superconformal invariants . the direct proof of absence of three- and four - loop corrections to @xmath2",
