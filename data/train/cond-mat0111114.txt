    "within the last years , potential technological applications of electronic devices based on ii - vi semiconductors @xcite have inspired basic research concerning surfaces of these materials . in this context , various studies have addressed the properties of surface reconstructions .",
    "experimental studies have investigated which reconstructions are present @xcite and how the reconstruction of the surface is influenced by parameters like temperature and particle flux in an mbe environment @xcite .",
    "the majority of this work has been devoted to cdte and znse , where a fairly complete qualitative overview over the phase diagram has been gained .",
    "an overview over the properties of cdte can be found in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "there have been theoretical investigations of the reconstructions of cdte @xcite and znse @xcite using density functional theory . in these studies ,",
    "knowledge about the chemical bonding of surface atoms and ground state energies of various reconstructions has been gained .",
    "being based on quantum mechanics , density functional theory is believed to be exact apart from approximations made in the calculation .",
    "the computational burden of this method is comparatively high , which restricts its practical applicability to systems consisting of only a few atoms . due to the periodicity of crystal surfaces",
    "this is not a severe restriction if one is interested in ground state properties of the system which however , are strictly relevant only at zero temperature . at higher temperature , the properties of the surface will be influenced by thermodynamic effects .",
    "these are particularly important if phase transitions between different reconstructions occur .",
    "their theoretical investigation requires the study of systems with a large number of atoms which is beyond the scope of first principles methods or molecular dynamics simulations using realistic empirical potentials .",
    "consequently , simplifying models are needed which preserve essential features of atomic interactions and can be investigated with moderate numerical effort . in many cases ,",
    "two - dimensional lattice gases have been used successfully to model atoms adsorbed on a singular crystal surface or the terminating layer of such a crystal @xcite . in spite of the conceptual simplicity of such models the interplay of attractive and repulsive short range interactions can result in highly nontrivial critical behaviour and complex phase diagrams . in this paper , we will follow this approach to model the reconstructions of @xmath0 surfaces of cdte and znse , our main focus being on cdte .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in section [ overview ] , we will give a short review of the known facts about the reconstructions of the @xmath0 surfaces of cdte and znse .",
    "in section [ lgasbasics ] , we introduce a lattice gas model which considers the occupation of cd sites and the dimerization of te atoms and discuss its phase diagram .",
    "we conclude with a comparison of the features of our model with experimental results in section [ experimentcompare ] .",
    "( 100 , 30)(0 , 0 ) ( 0 , 0 ) ( 26 , 0 ) ( 54,0 ) ( 80,0 )    both cdte and znse crystallize in the zinc - blende lattice .",
    "this lattice structure is composed of alternating layers of cations and anions which are parallel to the @xmath0 surface , such that an ideal @xmath0 surface would be terminated by a complete layer of one particle species .",
    "the positions of the atoms in one layer lie on a regular square lattice with its axes oriented in the @xmath1 $ ] direction and the @xmath2 $ ] direction .    under vacuum ,",
    "the @xmath0 surface of cdte is cd terminated .",
    "the surface is characterized by vacancy structures where less than one half of the potential cd sites in the top layer are occupied @xcite .",
    "this can be understood from simple quantum - mechanical considerations like the electron counting rule @xcite , which states that a surface terminated by a complete layer of cd is energetically unfavourable . at low temperature ,",
    "one finds a @xmath3 reconstruction @xcite , where cd atoms and vacancies arrange in a checkerboard pattern ( figure [ figrek]a ) .",
    "frequently , a contribution of a @xmath4 arrangement can be found . in the @xmath4 structure ,",
    "the cd atoms arrange in rows along the @xmath1 $ ] direction which alternate with rows of vacancies ( figure [ figrek]b ) .",
    "density functional calculations @xcite have shown that the surface energies of the two competing reconstructions are nearly degenerate and differ only by a small amount @xmath5 per @xmath6 surface unit cell . at a temperature @xmath7 ,",
    "there is a phase transition @xcite above which the @xmath4 arrangement of the cd atoms dominates the surface .",
    "an analysis of high resolution low energy electron diffraction ( hrleed ) peaks @xcite has shown , that there is a high degree of disorder in this high temperature phase .",
    "one finds elongated domains with a large correlation length of @xmath8 in the @xmath2 $ ] direction and a domain width as small as @xmath9 in the @xmath1 $ ] direction .",
    "if cdte is exposed to an external cd flux in an mbe chamber , the @xmath3 reconstruction is stabilized at temperatures above the transition in vacuum . under a te flux",
    ", the surface is te terminated with a @xmath10 reconstruction . at small te fluxes , the surface is terminated by a complete monolayer of te . the te atoms on the surface form dimers which arrange in rows ( figure [ figrek]c ) . at high te flux and low temperature ,",
    "one additional te atom is incorporated into each dimer , such that the te coverage of the surface is 1.5 .",
    "the symmetry of this reconstruction is still @xmath11 , since the te trimers tend to arrange in rows .",
    "a schematical phase diagram of the surface can be found in @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , the properties of the reconstructions of znse @xcite are quite similar to those of cdte , where the zn atoms are the counterparts of the cd atoms and the se atoms those of te , respectively .",
    "there is one important exception : to date , no @xmath12 reconstructed surface has been found at high temperature .",
    "density functional calculations @xcite yield a higher energy difference @xmath13 per @xmath6 surface unit cell between ideal @xmath14 and @xmath15 reconstructed surfaces , which is approximately twice the value calculated for cdte .",
    "as we will show , this greater energy difference might explain the different behaviour of cdte and znse .",
    "the basic structure of our model of ( 001 ) surfaces is the same for different ii - vi semiconductors .",
    "the differences between the materials are represented by the numerical values of parameters . in the following , for simplicity we will loosely speak of cd and te atoms instead of `` cations '' and `` anions '' without restricting ourselves to a modelling of cdte only .    in the lattice gas picture ,",
    "a crystal lattice which is fixed in space is considered .",
    "each lattice site is either occupied by an atom or empty .",
    "there are effective interactions between atoms which include effects of surface strain and , at elevated temperature , lattice vibrations .",
    "therefore , there is no simple mapping between ground state energies of the lattice gas model and surface energies determined from density functional theory .",
    "we model a flat @xmath0 surface of cdte i.e. we neglect the influence of steps on the reconstruction .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation if the typical distance between steps is much greater than the size of the unit cell of the reconstruction . in thermal equilibrium",
    ", this is fulfilled at temperatures well below the roughening transition . in this case , in the absence of bulk vacancies or other defects the crystal is uniquely described by the state of the topmost monolayer which consists of one cd half - layer and a te half - layer . in our model , we consider such a monolayer with the cd atoms on top . for simplicity , we assume the te layer to be fully occupied .",
    "this is not a severe restriction , since the removal of te atoms will uncover cd atoms in the layer below . within the limit of a model of a flat surface",
    ", we simply do not distinguish whether a cd terminated surface has been created by removing a te layer or by depositing additional cd atoms onto an intact te layer .",
    "we use cartesian coordinates where the @xmath16-axis points in the @xmath1 $ ] direction , the @xmath17-axis points in the @xmath2 $ ] direction and the @xmath18-axis points in the @xmath19 $ ] direction .",
    "the origin of the coordinate system is at the center of a cd atom .",
    "since we consider a flat surface , the @xmath18-coordinate of all atoms of one species is identical and will be omitted in the following .",
    "measuring the lattice constant in appropriate units , the cd atoms are at positions @xmath20 with integer @xmath21 .",
    "the te atoms are at positions @xmath22 , where @xmath23 .",
    "tellurium dimers are created by the formation of a chemical bond between neighbouring te atoms in @xmath17-direction ( @xmath2 $ ] ) . since this is also the direction of the bonds of a surface cd atom , a te dimer is formed by a pair of atoms , which might also be the binding partners of a cd atom above them .",
    "this suggests a simple lattice gas representation both of the occupation of cd sites and te dimerization : we consider a rectangular array @xmath16 of integers @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 represents a cd atom at site @xmath26 , which is bound to the te atoms at sites @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 corresponds to a dimerization of te atoms @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "otherwise , @xmath30 .    in principle",
    ", one might also consider the formation of te trimers by introducing a fourth state @xmath31 .",
    "this corresponds to a trimer which consists of the te atoms at @xmath27 and @xmath28 and an additional te atom at @xmath26 .",
    "however , the formation of te trimers plays a role only if the surface is exposed to a strong flux of pure te at comparatively low temperature .",
    "therefore , we have neglected this effect to reduce the number of parameters of our model and the numerical effort of its investigation .",
    "the detailed representation of the surface energies of a ii - vi compound certainly would require long - range interactions and terms which depend on the simultaneous occupation of three or more sites .",
    "however , it is plausible to assume that the dominant contribution to the surface energy stems from pairwise interactions of atoms at short distances . in this section ,",
    "we introduce a hamiltonian which considers pairwise interactions between @xmath32 on nearest neighbour sites and diagonal neighbour sites . these reflect the known properties of the reconstructions of cdte and znse .    due to the electron counting rule , surfaces with cd coverages greater than @xmath33 are unstable while both a @xmath3 reconstruction and a @xmath4 reconstruction are permitted .",
    "this feature can be captured by introducing a hardcore repulsion between cd atoms on neighbouring sites in the @xmath17-direction . in the @xmath16-direction , an attractive interaction favours the occupation of nearest neighbour pairs the strength of which",
    "is denoted by @xmath34 .",
    "an attractive interaction @xmath35 between diagonal neighbours stabilizes the @xmath3 reconstruction .",
    "these parameters are chosen such that the energy difference @xmath36 between these two reconstructions is small compared to the total surface energy per site .",
    "the electron counting rule favours te dimerization , but forbids the formation of additional bonds of dimerized te atoms .",
    "therefore , we forbid the simultaneous occupation of neighbour sites in the y - direction with dimers ( formation of chains of te - te - bonds ) and cd atoms next to a dimer .",
    "these rules permit both a @xmath10 reconstruction , where the dimers arrange in rows and a @xmath37 reconstruction , where they arrange in a checkerboard pattern .",
    "density functional calculations @xcite have shown that the surface energy of @xmath10 is significantly lower than that of a @xmath37 reconstruction .",
    "this may be understood from the more efficient relaxation of surface strain in @xmath10 : since the lattice is deformed in the same direction by dimers on neighbouring sites in x - direction , such an arrangement will be energetically favourable .",
    "we consider this fact by an attractive nearest neigbour interaction @xmath38 between dimers in x - direction .",
    "additionally , a dimer contributes a binding energy @xmath39 to the surface energy .",
    "apart from the hardcore repulsion , we consider no interaction between cd atoms and dimers .",
    "an overview over the couplings in our model can be found in figure [ figrek]d .",
    "this yields the hamiltonian @xmath40 where we have introduced @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the boundary conditions are assumed to be periodic .",
    "@xmath43 represents the occupation of lattice sites with cd atoms : @xmath44 at the positions of cd atoms and zero otherwise .",
    "similarely , the positions of dimers are given by @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath46 is the effective cadmium chemical potential , which includes the binding energy of surface cd atoms to the substrate .",
    "the groundstate of the system at @xmath47 is determined by the chemical potential @xmath46 . for @xmath48 ,",
    "the surface configuration with minimal energy is @xmath3 . for @xmath49",
    "the groundstate is @xmath10 .    in the following , we measure energy in dimensionless units which have been adjusted such that @xmath50 .",
    "additionally , we set @xmath51 such that temperature is measured in units of @xmath52 .      to characterize the surface reconstruction quantitatively",
    ", we evaluate the mean cd coverage @xmath53 and the correlations @xmath54 @xmath55 measures the probability to find two diagonal neighbour sites which are simultaneously occupied by cd atoms .",
    "this is a measure for the fraction of the surface which is covered by regions with a _",
    "local _ @xmath3 order .",
    "similarely , @xmath56 measures the contribution of locally @xmath4 reconstructed regions in the system .",
    "the _ long range order _ of the cd atoms is measured by the order parameters @xmath57 @xmath58 is the staggered magnetization of a system of ising variables @xmath59 , where @xmath60 if @xmath44 and @xmath61 otherwise .",
    "large absolute values indicate a long range order of the @xmath3 reconstruction .",
    "its counterpart @xmath62 measures the long range order of @xmath4 .",
    "further , we introduce the mean tellurium dimerization @xmath63 and the dimer correlation @xmath64 , which characterizes the number of dimers which are incorporated in _ locally _ @xmath15 ordered areas .",
    "their long range order is characterized by @xmath65      we have investigated this model by means of the transfer matrix method and monte carlo simulations .",
    "an introduction to the transfer matrix technique can be found e.g. in @xcite .",
    "this method allows for a numerical calculation of the free energy of lattice systems with short - range interactions . in general",
    ", the system size must be finite in all directions but one .",
    "in our investigations , we choose the @xmath17-direction as the infinite direction .",
    "since the computational effort increases exponentially fast with the system size @xmath66 in the @xmath16-direction , only comparatively small @xmath67 are feasible .",
    "however , this is sufficient to investigate the phase transitions of the system in the limit @xmath68 via finite size scaling techniques . to this end , we have applied the method suggested in @xcite to determine the loci of first order phase transitions and to compute coverage discontinuities .",
    "continuous transitions have been investigated by means of phenomenological renormalization group theory @xcite .    additionally , we have performed monte carlo simulations of our model . to obtain a reasonably fast equilibration ,",
    "we have applied continuous time algorithms @xcite .",
    "a more detailled description of these methods is presented in the appendix .",
    "we have simulated both the grand - canonical ensemble where @xmath69 is controlled by @xmath46 and the canonical ensemble where the number of cd atoms in the system is fixed . in general , the results of the transfer matrix calculations and the monte carlo simulations are in good agreement ( figure [ fig1 ] ) .      to get insight into the typical behaviour of the model , we will first present a detailed investigation using the parameter set @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "the choice @xmath72 reflects the fact that the energy difference between @xmath3 and @xmath4 is small .",
    "the choice @xmath73 yields low concentrations of te atoms which are neither dimerized nor bound to cd atoms .",
    "this is consistent with experimental results . for simplicity ,",
    "we have chosen @xmath74 as a typical example of the case where both couplings are of the same order of magnitude . however , since there is no next - nearest neighbour interaction between dimers , there is a significant difference in the surface energies of @xmath10 and @xmath75 , which is consistent with the results of @xcite .    in section [ parametersetinfluence ]",
    "we discuss the influence of the numerical values of the parameters on the phase diagram .",
    "we will show , that a smaller value of @xmath38 affects the phase diagram qualitatively .",

    "as an example , in figure [ fig2 ] a phase diagram with @xmath134 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 is shown .",
    "the coexistence regime ( 4 ) vanishes at @xmath137 such that there is no phase separation between the long - range ordered @xmath10 phase and the disordered phase .",
    "this parameter set yields a comparatively high @xmath125 .",
    "therefore , the line where @xmath114 is at relatively low cd coverages .",
    "in contrast to the situation at large @xmath38 , the chemical potential at which the transition from phase ( 1 ) to phase ( 2 ) occurs is not independent of temperature .",
    "instead , the transition is at slightly greater @xmath46 at higher temperature . in consequence",
    ", there is a small range @xmath138 where there is a phase transition from phase ( 2 ) to phase ( 1 ) if @xmath79 is increased at constant chemical potential .",
    "the results presented in section [ results ] suggest an interpretation of the experimentally observed crossover from a @xmath3 reconstruction to a @xmath4 reconstruction as an accompanying effect of an order - disorder phase transition . at low temperature",
    ", there is a long - range ordered cd - rich phase with a @xmath3 reconstruction . at a critical temperature , the cd atoms lose their long - range order and arrange preferentially in a @xmath11 pattern .",
    "this picture is consistent with the experimental observation of small domains in the @xmath4 reconstruction @xcite which indicate a high degree of disorder .    strictly speaking",
    ", a cdte surface under vacuum is not in thermal equilibrium . at the temperature of the @xmath3 - @xmath4 transition",
    ", sublimation plays an important role .",
    "however , in a previous publication @xcite we have shown that the basic features of a simplified version of our model which neglects te dimerization @xcite are preserved under the conditions of step flow sublimation .",
    "this is the dominant sublimation mechanism for cdte ( 001 ) @xcite .",
    "sublimation is slow enough to permit a _ local equilibration _ of the terminating layer which justifies the application of equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "however , the cd coverage @xmath69 is determined by the sublimation process .",
    "therefore , within the limit of an equilibrium model it is not possible to calculate the path in the phase diagram that cdte follows .",
    "auger measurements @xcite yield @xmath139 at the transition temperature in vacuum .",
    "this suggests that the system is in the coexistence regime for a wide range of temperatures .",
    "then , the behaviour of cdte in vacuum should be similar to our results at constant @xmath106 ( section [ canonicalresults ] ) .",
    "electron diffraction techniques investigate large regions on the surface and hence yield averages over all coexisting phases .",
    "consequently , it should be reasonable to compare results of these experiments with quantities which are averaged over the whole system in our canonical simulations . as discussed in section [ canonicalresults ] , there are two independent effects which lead to a clear dominance of the arrangement of cd atoms in rows : the order - disorder transition in the cd - rich phase and the fact that an increasing fraction of the cd atoms is dissolved in the te - rich phase .",
    "electrons are diffracted both from the cd atoms and the te dimers which have @xmath11 order .",
    "the superposition of these effects should yield the pronounced @xmath140 diffraction peaks which have been observed in @xcite .    in the @xmath3 reconstructed phase , at temperatures well below",
    "the phase transition one frequently finds collective thermal excitations of adatoms , where a row of several cd atoms is shifted by one lattice constant in the y - direction .",
    "due to the repulsion between cd atoms in this direction , this is possible only if one cd atom per excitation is missing .",
    "an example is shown in figure [ fig2]d .",
    "this effect has been observed experimentally by seehover et .",
    "@xcite at room temperature using stm microscopy .",
    "there is a striking similarity between figure 3 in @xcite and figure [ fig2]d .",
    "the phase diagram of our model explains the properties of the reconstructions of the cdte ( 001 ) surface under an external particle flux .",
    "if the cd coverage of the surface is increased by deposition of cd , the state of the system moves into regions of the phase diagram where the cd atoms arrange preferentially in a @xmath141 pattern .",
    "depending on temperature , this is either the ordered @xmath3 phase ( 2 ) or the region of the disorded phase ( 3 ) on the right side of the dashed line where @xmath142 .",
    "indeed , experiments @xcite have shown that an external cd flux restores the @xmath3 reconstruction at high temperatures where a @xmath11 order is found under vacuum conditions . clearly , a strong te flux induces the formation of a long - range ordered @xmath10 phase at temperatures below @xmath100 .",
    "on znse , a zn terminated @xmath11 reconstruction has not been observed yet .",
    "our model offers an explanation of this fact which is consistent with the results of density functional theory @xcite .",
    "these calculations have shown , that the difference in the surface energies per @xmath6 surface unit cell between perfect cation terminated @xmath141 and @xmath140 reconstructions in znse is significantly greater than in cdte ( @xmath143 versus @xmath144 ) . in our model , this greater energy difference corresponds to a smaller value of @xmath132 which shifts the line where @xmath114 to smaller coverages .",
    "consequently , a @xmath145 arrangement dominates in a much wider range of coverages .",
    "wolframm et .",
    "@xcite have measured the locus of the transition beween the @xmath145 reconstruction and the @xmath146 reconstruction as a function of temperature and the composition of an external particle flux by means of reflection high energy electron diffraction ( rheed ) .",
    "they find that at higher temperature a greater se flux is required to obtain a @xmath11 diffraction pattern . at temperatures above 450 @xmath147c no @xmath146 reconstruction could be observed even under extremely se - rich conditions .",
    "this is reminiscent of our observation that the anion - rich phase ( 1 ) vanishes at a temperature @xmath100 .",
    "unfortunately , the available experimental data are insufficient for a systematic fit of the model parameters .",
    "however , some rough estimates show that at least the orders of magnitude are reasonable .",
    "as discussed above , the @xmath3 -@xmath4 transition of cdte in vacuum should be at a temperature close to @xmath117 . identifying this with the experimental value of 570 k",
    ", we obtain the value of our energy unit @xmath148 in physical units .",
    "this yields a value @xmath149 for the difference in the surface energies of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which is about @xmath33 of the value of @xmath150 which has been obtained by means of dft calculations .",
    "this shows at least that the qualitative agreement between experiments and our model has been obtained in a physically reasonable region of the parameter space",
    ".    in our model , phase ( 1 ) vanishes at a temperature @xmath151 which has been measured in experiments on znse , we obtain that @xmath152 .",
    "this is the same order of magnitude as our estimate of @xmath52 in cdte .",
    "these considerations suggest that it should be possible to obtain quantitative agreement between experiments and our model both for cdte and znse with values of the model parameters on the order of magnitude of a few ten mev .",
    "we thank wolfgang kinzel and richard metzler for stimulating discussions and a critical reading of the manuscript .",
    "m.a . was supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft .",
    "we have simulated our model using continuous time monte carlo techniques which greatly improve the computational speed compared to simpler , metropolis like algorithms @xcite . a markov chain of states @xmath153 of the system is constructed with transition rates @xmath154 between states @xmath153 and @xmath155 .",
    "this dynamics converges to a gibbs distribution if every possible state of the system can be reached within a finite number of transition events ( ergodicity ) and the rates fulfil a detailed balance condition @xmath156 . in every time step ,",
    "one event is performed which is selected randomly with probability @xmath157 , where @xmath158 is the sum of transition rates of all possible events in state @xmath153 .",
    "the physical time interval @xmath159 which passes between subsequent events depends on the state of the system . in the calculation of thermal averages ,",
    "the observables measured in state @xmath153 have to be weighted with @xmath160 .",
    "this algorithm requires the knowledge of the rates of all possible events in the current state of the system .",
    "if the configuration of the system is changed only locally in an event , both the selection of events and the updates of the rates of events can be done in @xmath161 cpu steps using a binary search tree . here",
    ", @xmath162 is the number of possible events .",
    "the application to grand - canonical simulations is straightforward .",
    "there are two possible events per lattice site which change the state of the site : @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "these simulations can be done with metropolis - type rates @xmath165\\}$ ] or symmetrical rates @xmath166 $ ] .",
    "both possibilities yield identical results .",
    "a canonical simulation requires an algorithm where the number of particles is fixed . in this case ,",
    "in every event one particle jumps to a different site .",
    "we choose a nonlocal dynamics where the range of particle jumps is unlimited .",
    "this yields considerably faster equilibration compared to a kawasaki dynamics with nearest neighbour diffusion only . for simplicity",
    ", we permit only jumps to a site where the binding energy of the particle is independent of the state of its initial site , i.e. we forbid jumps to nearest and next nearest neighbour sites .",
    "if the particle jumps from site @xmath167 to site @xmath168 , the energy difference between the final and the initial state is @xmath169 , where @xmath170 is the energy difference of the system with site @xmath16 occupied and empty .",
    "the rates @xmath171\\ ] ] fulfil the detailed balance condition .",
    "then , the probability for a jump from site @xmath167 to site @xmath168 factorizes , i. e. @xmath172 here , we have introduced the rate for deposition of a particle at site @xmath16 ( @xmath173 ) and for removal of a particle at site @xmath16 ( @xmath174 ) .",
    "@xmath175 $ ] if site @xmath16 is empty and zero otherwise .",
    "conversely , @xmath176 $ ] on occupied sites and zero on empty sites . due to this factorization property",
    "we can proceed in two steps : in the first step , we select the site @xmath167 from which the particle starts with probability @xmath177 .",
    "then , we select the site @xmath168 where the particle is landing with probability @xmath178 . if the distance between site @xmath167 and site @xmath168 is @xmath179 the particle is moved . otherwise , the event is rejected and the system remains unchanged . since the number of rejected events is small on large systems , the loss of speed can be neglected .",
    "however , in our model only the number of cd atoms is fixed , while the number of te dimers may change .",
    "this requires a more elaborate algorithm which uses both canonical and grand - canonical techniques .",
    "a cd atom may jump to any site which is not occupied by a cd atom .",
    "if the arrival site is occupied by a dimer , the dimer is destroyed .",
    "the removal of the cd atom at the starting site creates a pair of te atoms .",
    "we consider both the case where these te atoms dimerize immediately and the case where they remain unbound .",
    "additionally , te dimers may break up and dimers may be created on empty sites . in the following , these processes will be denoted as `` dimer flips '' . in each timestep",
    ", a random number is drawn to decide whether a cd jump with immediate formation of a dimer at the starting site , a cd jump without dimerization or a dimer flip will occur .",
    "the probabilities are proportional to the sums of the rates of the processes in each group .",
    "a @xmath180 system contains @xmath181 cd atoms and te dimers .",
    "thus , there are @xmath181 dimer flip events",
    ". since there are @xmath181 possible arrival sites for each cd atom , there are @xmath182 cd jump events . to keep the ratio of dimer flips and cd jumps independent of the system size ,",
    "the dimer flips have been weighted with a prefactor @xmath183 .",
    "then , one event in the selected group is perfomed . for dimer flips ,",
    "this is done with the grand - canonical algorithm while cd jumps are performed by the canonical two - step algorithm .",
