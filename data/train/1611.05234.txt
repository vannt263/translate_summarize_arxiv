    "# 171462 ) .",
    "entries containing at most @xmath6 different species are retrieved in the form of cif files  @xcite using routines distributed within the aiida platform  @xcite , and passed through successive cod - tools filters  @xcite to correct typical syntax errors that prevent the successful reconstruction of the intended crystal structures ( see methods for more details ) .",
    "entries with partial occupancies in the unit cell are then filtered out , together with cif files that do not provide the explicit position of one or several atoms , can not be parsed , or are obviously wrong .",
    "purely theoretical structures are also discarded .",
    "the cif files are then converted into aiida structures using the pymatgen  @xcite parser .",
    "the spglib software  @xcite is subsequently used to find the primitive cells and to refine the atomic positions , in order to avoid unwanted loss of crystal symmetries due to round - off errors ( see methods for more details ) .",
    "finally , duplicate structures ( found using the pymatgen structure matcher@xcite - see methods ) are removed from our initial set of 3d structures .",
    "the removal of duplicates is done first independently on each of the icsd and cod sets .",
    "then , every structure of the icsd set for which there exists a similar structure inside the cod is also removed .",
    "this procedure provides a starting set of @xmath7 unique 3d crystal structures , to be further investigated .          the 3d structures classified as unique",
    "can then be analysed to find promising candidates for exfoliation into one or several 2d materials .",
    "the first step consists in identifying composite structures , i.e. , structures that can be decomposed into disconnected units held together by weak interactions .",
    "a pioneering attempt in this direction has been put forward by lebgue and coauthors  @xcite even if limited to high - symmetry compounds with layers perpendicular to the @xmath8 $ ] crystal axis .",
    "a versatile algorithm is however needed in order to cope with the following general and realistic situations :    * layered structures belonging to any crystal system ( obvious exceptions are the cubic systems  @xcite ) ; * orientation of the stacking direction not along the @xmath8 $ ] axis ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig:2dlayerfinder]b ) ;",
    "* layers apparently outside the 3d primitive unit cell , requiring the use of sufficiently large supercells to check for connectivity ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig:2dlayerfinder]c ) ; * layers that are interpenetrating , i.e. with overlapping projections along the stacking direction ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig:2dlayerfinder]d ) ; * composite structures that include units with different dimensionalities ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig:2dlayerfinder]e ) ; * different chemical environment affecting the typical bond distance between atoms , requiring some tolerance in the screening parameters .    here",
    "we provide a protocol that is able to deal with all the scenarios above and identify layers that can then be fed into first - principles calculations .",
    "the goal is to automatically find chemically - bonded manifolds in a given structure , and among them select those that are periodic in two independent directions .",
    "the fundamental steps are reported schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dlayerfinder]a .",
    "first , from the bulk primitive cell of the 3d candidate a @xmath9 supercell is created .",
    "all interatomic distances are evaluated and chemical bonds are identified as those for which @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the distance between two atoms @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the van - der - waals radius of atom @xmath12 as obtained from alvarez ( ref .  ) , and @xmath15 is a parameter that we specify below .",
    "the criterion in   is based on the statistical analysis of the distribution of over five million interatomic distances , according to which alvarez pointed out that covalent bonds are likely to form only when the distance between atoms is shorter than the sum of the vdw radii by more than a quantity @xmath15 ( on average equal to 1.3   ) .",
    "thus , if the interatomic distance is smaller than @xmath16 as required by eq .  , then the two atoms should be chemically connected . on the contrary , if the interatomic distance is larger than this , then any kind of strong chemical bonding should be absent and only vdw interactions remain ( some special case involving hydrogen or metallic bonding are still possible and discussed in ref .  , but we will not consider them here ) . in our analysis",
    "we have considered five equally spaced values for @xmath15 between @xmath17    and @xmath18   to account for possible uncertainties in the values of the vdw radii and of @xmath15 itself .",
    "we believe that a criterion based on vdw radii could be more robust and versatile than one based on covalent radii , as it allows to take into account the unavoidable bond - length fluctuations associated with different chemical environments .",
    "as soon as all bonds are identified , chemically connected groups are constructed .",
    "@xmath9 supercells are needed to correctly describe cases when a group of bonded atoms spans a total of three unit cells in a given direction , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dlayerfinder]c . in principle",
    ", even such supercells might not be large enough in some rare cases , although the algorithm could then be applied to even larger supercells .",
    "the dimensionality of each connected group is obtained from the rank of the set of vectors linking an atom to all of its chemically connected periodic images ( periodic according to the 3d lattice vectors ) .",
    "this approach is general and does not assume any specific orientation of the 2d plane with respect to the crystal or cartesian axes .",
    "moreover , it also identifies and returns other low - dimensional units , such as 1d chains or 0d clusters .    applying the full protocol to all @xmath7 unique 3d structures , we found @xmath19 layered materials that can be considered as potential parents of 2d monolayers .",
    "the geometrical screening described in the previous section provides an exhaustive list of potential candidates for exfoliation .",
    "although an important first step , this geometrical characterization is not sufficient and has to be complemented with accurate calculations in order to identify materials that do actually exhibit weak interlayer bonding and are easily exfoliable .",
    "here we use vdw dft simulations to proceed with such a refinement ( computational details can be found in the methods ) .",
    "the first step is the optimization of the 3d geometry ( cell vectors and atomic positions ) of the layered structures found .",
    "this procedure is completely automated within aiida .",
    "preference is given to the simplest structures , both for their higher relevance and for computational efficiency .",
    "as a result , at least all unary compounds containing less than @xmath20  atoms in the unit cell , all binaries and ternaries with less than @xmath21  atoms , and all other quaternary , quinary , and senary compounds with less than @xmath22  atoms are considered ; in total , @xmath23 layered compounds have been studied with first - principles calculations .",
    "these structures are relaxed using two different non - local vdw - compliant functionals : the vdw - df2 functional  @xcite with c09 exchange  @xcite ( df2-c09 ) and the revised vydrov - van voorhis  @xcite ( rvv10 ) functional .    to assess the accuracy in predicting the equilibrium structure for the functionals adopted",
    ", we compare the experimental interlayer distance ( defined as the distance between the geometrical centres of neighbouring layers ) of a subset of layered materials against computational predictions .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : volume_vs_exp ] , complemented also by the semi - local perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe)@xcite and the revpbe@xcite functionals . since revpbe and pbe are not designed to predict vdw interactions , discrepancies with experiments are larger , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : volume_vs_exp]a - b . on the contrary ,",
    "the two vdw - compliant functionals provide interlayer distances closer to experimental values and with a much smaller dispersion around the average ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : volume_vs_exp]c - d ) , and are able to correctly predict the structural properties of non - closely - packed materials ( including vdw - bonded structures ) .",
    "this can be quantified by looking at the mean absolute percentage errors ( @xmath24 for both vdw - df2-c09 and rvv10 , against @xmath25 and @xmath26 for revpbe and pbe , respectively ) .",
    "moreover , the low mean relative errors of vdw - df2-c09 and rvv10 predictions ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively ) show that these functional have no bias in determining the equilibrium interlayer distance of layered structures , while revpbe and pbe have a tendency to underbind that is emphasised at smaller packing ratios .          to go further in the selection of 2d materials , we need to determine if the interlayer interactions are weak enough for the parent compound to be a good candidate for exfoliation .",
    "after the structural optimization described previously , one can proceed with exfoliation , i.e. , separation into several substructures as described earlier .",
    "if the exfoliation produces one or several two - dimensional structures , the ground - state energy of each isolated unit is computed .",
    "note that , due to the change in atom positions and thus of bond lengths , dft optimization leads in certain cases to a non - exfoliable structure , even if the initial 3d parent directly extracted from the icsd or cod was classified as layered .",
    "the ground - state energy difference between the 3d bulk and all of its substructures ( of any dimensionality , including also 1d chains or 0d clusters ) gives the binding energy @xmath29 , closely related to the exfoliation energy , i.e. , the energy needed to exfoliate one layer out of a multilayer system  @xcite .",
    "here @xmath30 is chosen to be positive when the bulk is more stable than its individual low - dimensional constituents .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : binding]a the binding energies per layer and per unit surface obtained for well - known layered materials including graphite , hexagonal boron nitride and several transition - metal dichalcogenides .",
    "the values obtained with the two vdw functionals are in very good agreement with accurate reference calculations performed in ref .   using the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "for all these compounds ( except pdte@xmath31 ) the binding energies range between @xmath32 and @xmath21  mev@xmath0 .",
    "we then show in fig .",
    "[ fig : binding]b the distribution of the binding energies for the @xmath33 systems studied in this work . for both vdw functionals , a majority of compounds ( resp . @xmath34 for df2-c09 and @xmath35 for rvv10 )",
    "exhibit a binding energy smaller than @xmath20  mev@xmath0 , giving rise to a first very high peak in the distribution ( notice the logarithmic scale ) .",
    "a second broader peak appears between @xmath36 and @xmath37  mev@xmath0 and is associated with structures containing also lower dimensionality units ( i.e. , 0d or 1d ) in addition to the 2d layer(s ) .",
    "the larger binding energy is to be expected for structures with mixed dimensionality ( typically 0d and 2d ) where charge transfer between intercalated units and 2d layers can take place giving rise to ionic bonds , as in the case of nasb@xmath31as@xmath31  @xcite .",
    "this means that these additional 0d or 1d substructures could have been erroneously separated from the 2d layers in the geometrical screening .",
    "the binding energies distribution is quite continuous . as a result ,",
    "a criterion to select layered materials solely based on the binding energy is difficult to define without a level of arbitrariness . to lift this ambiguity",
    ", we correlate the binding energy with the relative discrepancy in interlayer distance obtained in vdw and non - vdw dft calculations , using for the non - vdw simulations the revpbe functional  @xcite that , contrary to standard pbe , does not seem to display bonding interaction in the exchange energy  @xcite .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : binding]c this binding energy against the interlayer - distance difference for @xmath38 compounds that have been studied with the revpbe and df2-c09 functionals .",
    "we observe that most compounds with low binding energy exhibit a large relative discrepancy in interlayer distance calculated with the two functionals , which is expected since the interlayer interaction is very sensitive to vdw forces .",
    "this allows us to identify which layered compounds are characterised by vdw interactions between layers .",
    "we set the threshold for these ( shown in blue in fig .",
    "[ fig : binding]c ) at @xmath39  mev@xmath0 for binding energies computed with the df2-c09 functional , and @xmath40  mev@xmath0 for those computed using rvv10 .",
    "we classify two - dimensional systems exfoliated from compounds belonging to this group as `` easily exfoliable '' ( ee ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : binding]c , this choice recovers 2d materials commonly exfoliated in experiments  @xcite , validating the approach .    at the top",
    "left of fig .",
    "[ fig : binding]c , a number of compounds exhibit high binding energies and a similar interlayer distance when comparing the revpbe and vdw functionals ; many also contain substructures of mixed dimensionalities , as discussed before .",
    "this group can be clearly separated from the rest , and is shown in yellow in fig .",
    "[ fig : binding]c , the boundary being set at @xmath41  mev@xmath0 for both functionals .",
    "above this value , compounds are not considered exfoliable and they are discarded from the database .        between these two regions , compounds with intermediate binding energies ( in green in fig .",
    "[ fig : binding]c ) exhibit a relatively weak , possibly non - vdw , bonding . as an example",
    ", the compound pdte@xmath31 discussed above belongs to this region , and is metallic out - of - plane .",
    "we classify two - dimensional structures exfoliated from parents belonging to this group as `` potentially exfoliable '' ( pe ) .",
    "finally , materials for which the binding energy has been computed with both vdw functionals are classified according to the most optimistic prediction .      using these criteria , and after removal of duplicates ( see methods ) , we obtain @xmath42 easily exfoliable and @xmath43 potentially exfoliable compounds , for a total of @xmath44 candidates ( table  [ tab : stat ] summarises all different steps ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dstats ] we plot some statistics for this portfolio of promising materials , as well as for their 3d parents : we show the distribution of packing ratios in the icsd and cod structures , in the group of 3d layered compounds , and in the ee and pe ones , using covalent radii  @xcite to compute the atomic volume .",
    "while the initial databases contain many closely packed structures with packing ratios of 0.7 or more , the layered structures are peaked around low packing ratios ( 0.3 ) but with a spread extending up to 0.8 , even in the final set of exfoliable compounds .",
    "these considerations highlight how the packing ratio alone is not necessarily a good criterion to filter 2d structures .",
    "( note that the peak of cod at a packing ratio of 0.15  which goes beyond the upper limit of the graph  is due to the fact that cod is populated with a large number of molecular crystals , microporous networks , metal - organic frameworks , and zeolites . )    then , in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dstats]b we show the distribution of point groups , arranged by crystal system , in all 3d structures , compared to that of the exfoliable 3d compounds .",
    "most point groups are represented similarly in both sets , with the notable exception of all cubic point groups that are obviously absent from the set of layered compounds .",
    "moreover , the @xmath45 point group is much rarer in the layered compounds than in the icsd and cod databases , while the @xmath46 m , @xmath47 , @xmath47 m and @xmath6 mm point groups are conversely more present among 3d exfoliable compounds .",
    "it is interesting to note that while most of the 2d materials studied in the last ten years belong to the hexagonal crystal system , these structures represent only a minority of the full database of exfoliable materials .    finally , in fig .  [ fig:2dstats]c we show how the layered and 2d compounds are distributed in terms of the number of species and number of atoms in the unit cell . as apparent from the graph",
    ", there are hundreds of 2d structures with few atoms in the unit cell ( @xmath48 with less than @xmath6 atoms , @xmath49 with less than @xmath50 atoms ) , that can be used as a starting set for screening 2d materials with desired properties .",
    "we find 18 2d structures containing a single species , including all known exfoliable 2d unaries such as graphene and phosphorene .",
    "novel unaries belong to the class of pe materials and mostly arise from intercalation layers in the parent 3d structures ; they are typically not mechanically stable . interestingly , ternary 2d materials , which have been so far largely unexplored ,",
    "represent a significant fraction of structures with less than 10 atoms in the unit cell , demonstrating that it may be worth inspecting these more versatile compounds beyond the current realm of unary / binary 2d materials .        in order to provide a more precise overview ,",
    "we further classify the 2d materials of the ee group into different prototypes , according to their spacegroups and their structural similarity , when the species are all considered undistinguishable and only the stoichiometry matters ( for this we use the pymatgen structure matcher  see methods for more details ) .",
    "@xmath51 prototypes are found , among which the ten most common ones represent a total of @xmath52 structures and are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dprototypes ] .",
    "the most common structural prototype is that of cdi@xmath31 , which groups together @xmath53 similar structures , including many transition - metal dichalcogenides and dihalides .",
    "contrary to the general distribution of point groups in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dstats]b , most of these prototypes have high - order rotation axes , with the only exception being the rectangular feocl .",
    "although some of these structures have already been suggested as exfoliable  @xcite , the abundance of some relatively complex prototypes involving more than two species is new and compelling .",
    "moreover , we emphasise that the ndte@xmath54 prototype has not been reported before and it is common to many rare - earth tritellurides .    lcccr & unique & unique & common & total + & to icsd & to cod & to both & sum + experimental data & & & & + cif inputs & 99212 & 87070 & & 186282 + unique 3d structures & 34548 & 60354 & 13521 & 108423 + layered 3d structures & 3257 & 1180 & 1182 & 5619 +   +   + layered 3d , relaxed & 2165 & 175 & 870 & 3210 + binding energies & 1795 & 126 & 741 & 2662 + 2d easily exfoliable ( ee ) & 672 & 81 & 300 & 1053 + 2d pot .",

    "we identified an extensive database of exfoliable materials by systematic analysis and screening of structures from both the icsd and the cod structural databases .",
    "we developed a geometrical algorithm to select potentially layered materials that is general enough to recognise substructures independently of their crystallographic orientation , dimensionality and environment .",
    "the list of 2d materials obtained by geometrical considerations is then tested against accurate , validated vdw - dft computations of the binding energies for all layers identified .",
    "compounds with sufficiently small binding energies and where dispersion relations affect interlayer distances are deemed exfoliable .",
    "the materials identified are in particular classified into groups of easily ( @xmath42 ) or potentially ( @xmath43 ) exfoliable compounds , showing how only a very small fraction of possible 2d materials has been considered up to now .",
    "in particular , many opportunities might arise from materials with reduced symmetry or involving more than two atomic species but still with relatively simple structures . from the identification of the most common structural prototypes",
    ", we suggest that materials displaying promising properties like ferromagnetic insulators or tunable superconductors actually belong to larger families of structures that potentially contain novel materials with even more compelling characteristics .",
    "all results can be fully reproduced thanks to the deployment of the aiida infrastructure that tracks the provenance of each data entry . to date , this is the largest available database of 2d compounds .",
    "it is an often repeated tenet that results of scientific research must be reproducible .",
    "this objective is , however , challenging , especially in high - throughput research , due to the large number of simulations involved and the complex sequence of logical steps needed in the study . to ensure reproducibility we use aiida  @xcite as a materials informatics infrastructure to implement the ades model of automation , data , environment , and sharing , as discussed in ref .  .",
    "all input information for each calculation is stored in the aiida repository before calculations are launched and actual code inputs are created by aiida using only data already stored in the repository . however , even the ability to replicate single calculations is not sufficient , since the majority of results are obtained via long sequences of simulations .",
    "it is thus essential to persist the full provenance of each data item .",
    "this means , for instance , that for any 2d material identified in this work one can track from which 3d parent structure it originated ( including its source database ) , how the structure was processed to obtain its coordinates from the wyckoff positions , how the low - dimensional units were identified , and which parameters were used to compute the dft results .",
    "the cif files provided in crystallographic databases sometimes contain syntax errors or unnecessary information that needs to be corrected and/or removed before parsing them .",
    "to do so , we use cod - tools@xcite , in particular the ` cif_filter ` and ` cif_select ` scripts , in order to :    * fix common cif syntax errors , * parse and reformat the summary chemical formula ( from the tag ` _ chemical_formula_sum ` ) , * set explicit @xmath55 degrees cell angles if they are not given ( following the standard cif specifications ) , * remove empty non - loop tags , * remove cif data blocks without coordinates , * convert non - standard cif tag name capitalization into the capitalization specified by the cif dictionary , for example ` _ atom_site_cartn_x ` would be replaced by ` _",
    "atom_site_cartn_x ` .",
    "we also remove the tags ` _",
    "publ_author_name ` and ` _",
    "citation_journal_abbrev ` , that often contain problematic characters for , e.g. , the pymatgen cif parser ( this information is still stored in the aiida database and therefore fully searchable ) .    as already mentioned in the main text , in this step we consider only structures coming from experimental measurements , while the source databases are partially populated by purely theoretical structures .",
    "this is done using the flags set on the database entries by their curators .",
    "we also implemented some heuristics to detect clearly wrong cif files .",
    "for example , we discard structures where the chemical formula provided in the file is inconsistent with the elements in the unit cell . regardless of all these efforts , it is possible that some incomplete or incorrect structures are still not filtered out from the original databases .",
    "the crystal structures parsed from cif files are often subject to round - off errors in the atomic positions and/or cell parameters that artificially lower the number of symmetries .",
    "we use the spglib software  @xcite to refine each structure and recover the maximum number of symmetries , using the algorithm described in ref .  .",
    "interatomic distances and cell parameters are modified by at most @xmath56   with respect to the initially parsed structure . at the same time ( and with the same software ) , a standardised crystallographic primitive cell is extracted @xcite .      for the duplicate filtering procedure of both 3d and 2d structures , as well as for the prototyping of 2d structures , we have used extensively the `` structure matcher '' of pymatgen  @xcite , which , thanks to the algorithm described in ref .  , compares crystal structures .",
    "the goal is to 1 ) reduce the two structures to be compared to their primitive cells , 2 ) rescale the volumes ( if 3d ) , or the in - plane areas ( if 2d ) , 3 ) find , when it exists , an affine map between the two cells , within certain tolerances on the cell lengths and angles , and 4 ) compute the maximum distance between atomic sites when the two lattices are mapped onto a common average lattice .",
    "if this maximum is lower than a certain fraction of the average free length per atom , then the two structures are classified as similar .",
    "when comparing 3d structures , the tolerances on cell lengths , cell angles , and distances between paired atomic sites were chosen to be @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 of the average free length per atom , defined as the cubic root of the volume per atom . for 2d structures , due the artificial vacuum added to the cell in the out - of - plane direction",
    "the relative tolerances needed to be set tighter , and we chose @xmath25 , @xmath60 and @xmath25 , respectively .    to filter out duplicates of a set of structures , all compounds with same composition ( i.e. , the same species in the same relative proportion ) are compared among them using the structure - matcher algorithm , forming groups of matching structures .",
    "one unique structure is then chosen in each group as a representative for further calculations .",
    "the same tool is used to prototype 2d structures , but with a number of modifications : 1 ) two structures must have the same space - group to be considered as members of the same prototypical class ( we used spglib with a precision parameter of @xmath61    to get the space - group , see above ) , 2 ) the comparison is made irrespective of the specific species on each atomic site ( e.g. , mos@xmath31 and wte@xmath31 are both considered as ab@xmath31 ) , 3 ) when the two primitive cells do not contain the same number of sites , one also attempts to generate a supercell of the smaller lattice before the mapping , and 4 ) the tolerances on respectively the cell lengths , cell angles and maximum distance between sites are set to @xmath25 , @xmath58 and @xmath57 respectively .",
    "again all structures of the same kind of composition ( e.g. , ab@xmath31 , a@xmath31b@xmath54 , etc . ) are compared in pairs , to classify them into distinct prototypical classes .",

    "two different van - der - waals functionals are employed , namely the vdw - df2-c09@xcite and the revised vv10@xcite , in addition to the pbe@xcite and revpbe@xcite functionals . @xmath63-point sampling of the brillouin zone is set using a @xmath64centred monkhorst - pack grid , with an even number of @xmath63 points in each direction of the reciprocal lattice such that the spacing between two consecutive @xmath63 points along each direction is as close as possible to @xmath65  @xmath66 .",

    "<S> 2d materials databases are still scarce and limited in size : a first systematic scan of the icsd database providing @xmath1 two - dimensional compounds has been provided in ref .  , </S>",
    "<S> followed by @xmath2 compounds selected among specific classes of materials  @xcite ; finally a recent study focused on transition - metal dichalcogenides and oxides , identifying @xmath3 of them as stable  @xcite .    in order to fill this knowledge gap , </S>",
    "<S> high - throughput computational methods represent a promising tool@xcite that has proven to be extremely effective in screening materials without the need to synthesise them first@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , these techniques have been successfully employed in the search for novel materials for li - air and li - ion batteries@xcite , for hydrogen storage@xcite , electrocatalysis@xcite , or to accelerate the discovery of novel light - absorbing@xcite and light - harvesting@xcite materials .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we start from geometric and bonding criteria to identify layered materials among the compounds contained in the icsd and cod databases , independently of the layers shape , crystallographic orientation or embedding . </S>",
    "<S> we then use first - principles vdw density - functional theory ( dft ) simulations to validate these results . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we compute the binding energy of all prospective layered structures and identify those that are held together by weak interactions and ready for mechanical@xcite or liquid - phase@xcite exfoliation@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this results into a database of 1844 exfoliable 2d materials .    </S>",
    "<S> the reproducibility of the complete study is ensured by the aiida  @xcite materials informatics infrastructure , which keeps track of the provenance of each calculation and result . </S>"
