    "recurrent novae ( rne ) are interacting binary systems in which multiple nova outbursts have been observed .",
    "both thermonuclear runaway and accretion models have been hypothesised as the outburst mechanism in these systems @xcite . while thermonuclear is generally the preferred mechanism , there are problems with the high accretion rate required given the short outburst recurrence interval .",
    "the recurrent nova rs  ophiuchi has undergone six recorded outbursts in the last 108 years @xcite , the most recent occurring on 2006 february 12 , which we take as day 0 @xcite .",
    "rs  oph consists of a white dwarf primary accreting material from a red giant secondary within a nebula formed from the red giant wind .",
    "attempts to classify the secondary component have resulted in suggestions ranging from k0 iii @xcite to m4 iii @xcite , with several concluding m2 iii to be most likely @xcite .",
    "the white dwarf in the system is close to the chandrasekhar mass limit @xcite , hence the ratio of mass accreted to mass ejected will determine whether rs  oph is a potential supernova ia progenitor @xcite .",
    "the quiescent characteristics of rs  oph have led to its classification as a symbiotic star , although with a weak hot - component spectrum .",
    "most symbiotic stars do not exhibit the variability on time - scales of minutes seen in cataclysmic variables @xcite , yet short - time - scale , aperiodic variations in optical brightness have long been known in rs  oph in its quiescent state @xcite .",
    "these stochastic or aperiodic brightness variations are known as flickering , with ` strong ' flickering being of the order of a few tenths of magnitudes ( sokoloski et al .",
    "while symbiotic stars are a heterogenous class , other members show similarities to rs  oph that are applicable here .    to date",
    ", there have been no reported observations of the re - establishment of optical flickering in the immediate post - outburst phase of a recurrent nova , a fact that contributes to our uncertainty of the nature of the outburst mechanism .",
    "observations by @xcite on day 117 ( 2006 june 9 ) show no flickering of amplitude above 0.03  mag in b , from which they conclude that an accretion disc around the white dwarf has been destroyed as a result of the 2006 outburst .",
    "the lightcurve reached a post  outburst minimum in 2006 september .",
    "following discovery of rebrightening @xcite , we monitored rs  oph photometrically for two weeks in b and v bands , detecting the resumption of optical flickering @xcite .",
    "observations of duration 37 to 118  minutes were made on eleven nights between 2006 october 11 and 24 , the shorter observations being curtailed by cloud .",
    "observations were made with the south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) 1-m telescope and the saao ccd camera , a 1024@xmath41024 pixel site back - illuminated chip .",
    "the field of view is 5@xmath45 , which is sufficient to include several comparison stars close to the target , including usno - b1.0  0833 - 0368817 and -0368883 .",
    "integration times were typically 10  s in johnson  v ( 20  s in johnson  b ) , with a readout time of 19  s , allowing continuous v - band monitoring with a temporal resolution of @xmath530  s. longer exposure times were occasionally used to compensate for poorer sky conditions .",
    "details of each night s observations are given in table 1 .",
    "the 3 nights lacking data were lost due to cloud .",

    "figures  [ fig-11diff ] and  [ fig-24diff ] show differential lightcurves of rs  oph compared with two comparison stars in the field for the nights during which we detect some of the smallest and greatest flickering amplitudes , respectively . comparing the weakest flickering detected in the target ( figure  [ fig-11diff ] ) with brightness variations in the constant comparison stars verifies the intrinsic variability of rs  oph . flickering is also detected in the b - band data , plotted in figure  [ fig - rsnb ] .",
    "@xcite observed a selection of symbiotic stars , performing a statistical evaluation of the significance of flickering in the data .",
    "they calculate mean magnitudes and standard deviations in their variable targets ( @xmath7 ) and comparison stars ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "since the comparison stars in the field are all @xmath9  mag fainter than rs  oph , standard deviations on the value expected for a constant star of the same brightness as the target ( @xmath10 ) are derived from an empirical formula . with the number of counts in the data presented here being significantly lower than the @xcite values ( a few 1000s , cf .",
    "@xmath11 ) , this method proved less reliable when applied to our data .",
    "two alternative methods of deriving @xmath12 were used in the current analysis : ( a ) fitting a power law to the mean magnitude and @xmath8 values for the comparison stars , obtaining an estimate of @xmath12 in rs  oph by extrapolation , and ( b ) estimating @xmath13 by equating it to @xmath14 for the brightest comparison star ( 13.2 mag ) , thus yielding very conservative values .",
    "all results presented here were obtained using ( b ) , the more conservative technique , i.e. giving larger error bars .",
    "the ratio @xmath15 can be used to assess the significance of the flickering .",
    "the criteria specified by @xcite to determine the existence of flickering are : +    * @xmath16 - flickering `` probably present '' , and + * @xmath17 - flickering `` definitely present '' .",
    "+    evaluating the full dataset for each night according to the above criteria suggests that flickering is definitely evident in rs  oph on all but 3 nights observed . even using the conservatively large error estimates",
    ", @xmath18 is close to the cut - off value for definite flickering on these 3 nights .",
    "applying these criteria to ten minute periods within each night s data , we detect at least probable flickering for all ten minute periods on 6 nights , and definite flickering for at least half of all ten minute periods on 6 nights . again , despite being conservative estimates , these values are very close to @xmath18 for definite flickering . table  1 shows the mean ratio @xmath18 averaged over all ten minute intervals for each night , and also for each full night s data .",
    "the statistical analysis presented here is adequate to demonstrate that significant flickering is detected on time - scales of ten minutes to 2 hours .",
    "using equation ( 3 ) of @xcite , we obtain v - band flickering amplitudes ( @xmath19 ) in rs  oph ranging from 0.06  mag to 0.32  mag .",

[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab - obs ]    a decrease in the mean magnitude of rs  oph over the 2 week period is depicted in figure  [ fig - rsmag ] , from which the range in v magnitude detected each night is also apparent . the mean magnitude for each night",
    "is given in table  1 .",
    "during observations made between 241 and 254  days post  outburst , we detect aperiodic v - band variability in rs  oph , with amplitudes ranging from @xmath20  mag , constituting ` strong flickering ' ( sokoloski et al .",
    "observations made by @xcite on day 117 of the 2006 outburst show no variability with amplitude above 0.03  mag . in dwarf novae , optical flickering is attributed to two sources : the turbulent inner regions of the disc and the bright spot , where the stream of matter from the roche lobe - filling donor star impacts the outer edge of the accretion disc , with inhomogeneities in the flow thought to result in flickering ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the physical mechanism that causes flickering in symbiotics is not well understood , but is believed to originate from accretion onto a white dwarf @xcite . adopting this assumption ,",
    "these observations are consistent with re - establishment of accretion between 117 and 241  days after the onset of the 2006 outburst .",
    "this is the earliest reported detection of flickering subsequent to an outburst in rs  oph .",
    "mass transfer from the secondary component is generally attributed to one of two mechanisms : either roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) onto an accretion disc ; or through direct accretion of matter from the red giant wind onto the white dwarf . assuming the flickering we observe originates from a re - established accretion disc",
    ", we can place a constraint on the mass transfer rate .",
    "@xcite relate the time taken to re - establish the disc ( the viscous time - scale , @xmath21 ) to the inner radius of the disc ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "this radius can be further related to the rate of mass transfer through the disc ( which in this case we assume to equate to the white dwarf accretion rate , @xmath23 ) and the dynamical time - scale ( @xmath24 ) , which is approximately the time - scale of flickering . rearranging these equations sourced from @xcite ,",
    "we find :    @xmath25    where @xmath23 is in units of @xmath26 , and @xmath27 depends on the state ( high or low ) of the disc , with @xmath28 in the low state @xcite , which we assume in this case .",
    "we take @xmath29 to be @xmath30 @xcite . as flickering recommenced between days 117 and 241",
    ", we have a range of @xmath31  s. the shortest time - scale on which we see flickering is @xmath32  s. thus for a low state we obtain an upper limit of @xmath33 and a lower limit of @xmath34 .      in order to put this into context in terms of the mass transfer mechanism operating in the system , we now consider these values relative to mass transfer rates expected for accretion direct from the red giant wind and via rlof . a mass accretion ratio , @xmath35 , defined as the ratio of the mass accreting onto the primary @xmath23 , to the mass - loss rate from the donor companion @xmath36 , has been calculated by @xcite .",
    "they quote @xmath37 in a typical wind case , increasing to @xmath38 for rlof .",
    "studies of the symbiotic star eg  and by @xcite yield a mass - loss rate from the red giant of @xmath39 . since eg  and has a number of similar parameters to rs  oph ( m2 red giant secondary , 483  day orbital period @xcite cf .",
    "days in rs  oph @xcite , similar absolute magnitude ( sokoloski et al . 2001 ) ) , we adopt @xmath41 for rs  oph . applying the ratios from @xcite to this mass loss rate results in accretion rates of @xmath42 for rlof , and @xmath43 for direct wind accretion .",
    "thus our @xmath23 limits calculated in @xmath44  [ sec - masstransfer ] span the range required for direct wind accretion and rlof at the time accretion resumed .",
    "since the outburst mechanism is dependent on the mass transfer rate , we now consider the implications of the rate determined for this early stage of resumed accretion .",
    "@xcite present a grid of outburst characteristics compiled from models of thermonuclear runaway in novae .",
    "these data predict that for a system with a mass transfer rate of @xmath45 to @xmath46  @xmath47 onto a hot 1.4 @xmath48 white dwarf , we should expect an outburst recurrence period ranging from 200 to over 1000  yr , whereas the time elapsed between observed outbursts in rs  oph averages @xmath520  yr . indeed , translating this model to a slightly lower white dwarf mass more appropriate for rs  oph ( i.e. @xmath30 from @xcite ) produces a further increase in the outburst recurrence interval since the accreted mass required to trigger thermonuclear runaway is higher for a lower mass white dwarf . to allow for discrepancies in the white dwarf mass , basing these calculations on the value of @xmath49 determined by @xcite results in a lower @xmath50 , lengthening the recurrence interval still further . from @xcite ,",
    "a recurrence period of @xmath520  yr is achievable only if we have 100% accretion efficiency , i.e. @xmath51 , which far exceeds the findings of e.g. @xcite ( @xmath44  [ sec - nagaemodels ] ) .",
    "while our upper limit on the accretion rate approaches @xmath52 , the non - linear relation of the @xcite model means that the recurrence period remains several times longer than 20  yr for @xmath53 , and indeed a factor of two greater than the longest interval between observed outbursts in this system .",
    "the accretion luminosity of the system would be most accurately measured at uv wavelengths .",
    "while observations were made in the uv with @xmath54 , none exists prior to day 25 ( goad & beardmore , private communication ) . from this point on",
    "the uv tracks the behaviour of the supersoft x - ray emission attributed to fusion on the white dwarf surface @xcite .",
    "the 1985 observations came at a similar point post  outburst . hence between outbursts we need to estimate accretion rates by less direct methods .",
    "standard accretion theory predicts that disc luminosity is proportional to the mass transfer rate @xcite .",
    "thus the visual quiescent variation of 2.5  mag reported by @xcite implies a factor 10 variation in mass transfer rate during quiescence .",
    "as the visual magnitude during our observations was at the lower end of the quiescent magnitude range this implies that the inter - outburst accretion rate is typically higher than we see here .",
    "such variations of mass transfer rate are plausible in either the rlof or wind accretion scenario ; either on short time - scales due to erratic or clumpy mass transfer , or over longer periods , perhaps increasing as the disc becomes better established .",
    "@xcite , for example , determine a much larger mass accretion rate of @xmath55 for rs  oph between the outbursts in 1967 and 1985 , and brightness variations of up to 3  mag have been observed during periods of quiescence @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recurrence intervals in this object vary from 9 to 35 yr .",
    "orbital eccentricity may have a particularly marked effect on the rate of mass transferred by direct wind accretion , as the white dwarf trajectory would trace a route through varying densities of the red giant wind .",
    "indeed , the eccentricity in the system is completely unconstrained ; @xcite quote @xmath56 when modeled using the giant component and @xmath57 using the white dwarf .",
    "another factor not accounted for in the models that could potentially cause inconsistencies in the nova recurrence interval is that of residual heating of the white dwarf following an outburst , lowering the accreted mass required to trigger a subsequent outburst .",
    "further work is needed to fully verify the outburst mechanism in this and similar systems .",
    "1 .   statistically significant flickering is detected in rs  oph on days 241 to 254 of the 2006 outburst , consistent with the re - establishment of accretion between days 117 and 241 after outburst .",
    "2 .   over the 2 week period of observations ,",
    "the mean v magnitude decreases by @xmath58  mag from 11.4  to  11.9  mag .",
    "calculated limits on the white dwarf accretion rate of @xmath59 span the range required for both direct wind accretion and rlof mechanisms .",
    "we therefore find no conclusive evidence favouring one accretion mechanism over the other in rs  oph .",
    "4 .   current models are not sufficiently complete to confidently determine the accretion and outburst mechanisms in rs  oph .",
