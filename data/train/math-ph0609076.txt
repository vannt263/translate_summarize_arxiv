    "the classical 3-body problem of celestial mechanics studies the local and global geometry of the trajectories of a 3-body system under the influence of the gravitational forces , or equivalently a conservative system with potential energy @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the newtonian potential function .",
    "thus , when the particles have position vectors @xmath9 with respect to an inertial frame , the trajectories are locally characterized by newtons equation @xmath10 where @xmath11 @xmath12 are the mutual distances , and @xmath13 , @xmath14 , is the given mass distribution , assumed to be normalized so that @xmath15 . since the above equation is of order two , a trajectory is completely determined by the initial position and velocity of the particles - often referred to as the deterministic doctrine of classical mechanics .",
    "we use the following notation @xmath16 for the ( polar ) moment of inertia , kinetic energy and angular momentum , respectively .",
    "these are the basic kinematic quantities , and their interactions with the potential function @xmath2 play a major role in the dynamics of the 3-body problem .",
    "for example , it is easy to deduce the classical conservation laws from the system ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) , namely the conservation of total energy @xmath17 linear momentum @xmath18 and angular momentum @xmath19 . as usual ,",
    "the invariance of linear momentum allows us to choose the inertial reference frame with the origin at the center of mass .",
    "moreover , by differentiation of @xmath20 twice with respect to time @xmath21 and using ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) we get @xmath22 where we have used the fact that @xmath2 is homogeneous of degree @xmath23 as a function of the vectors @xmath24 .",
    "this is the _ lagrange - jacobi _ equation .    on the other hand ,",
    "trajectories can also be determined as solutions of a suitable boundary value problem , and the simplest and most basic one is , for example : @xmath25 then solutions are found by applying an appropriate least action principle , which characterizes solutions as extremals of an _ action integral _",
    "@xmath26 _ _  _ _ among those virtual motions @xmath27 with the given pair of end points , together with some additional constraints .    here",
    "we shall focus attention on the two least action principles due to lagrange and hamilton , which are quite different but dual to each other : @xmath28    \\label{1 - 4b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the motions @xmath29 are regarded as parametrized curves in the euclidean configuration space @xmath30 our aim , however , is to reduce the study of 3-body trajectories to a study of associated curves in a lower dimensional space , namely the _ interior _ configuration space , i.e. , the _ moduli space _ @xmath31 with the appropriate assumptions , one expects that the least action principles , as well as newton s differential equation , can be pushed down to the level of @xmath32 .",
    "in fact , one of our major results is that the study of 3-body motions with vanishing angular momentum further reduces to the analysis of specific curves on the shape space , which is the sphere @xmath33 .",
    "the final step of our program is , of course , the lifting procedure from the moduli curve @xmath34 back to the actual trajectory @xmath27 .",
    "but this is a purely geometric construction which is well understood ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite or the following subsection ) and it will not be a topic here .",
    "briefly , the curve in @xmath32 determines the trajectory in @xmath0 uniquely up to a global congruence .",
    "classical mechanics up to present time is largely based upon developments related to hamilton s least action principle , involving hamiltonian systems and canonical transformations .",
    "geometrically speaking , the underlying structure is the symplectic geometry of the phase space .",
    "however , in this paper we shall rather focus on the riemannian geometric approach , based upon jacobi s reformulation of lagrange s least action principle . in his famous lectures @xcite",
    ", jacobi introduced the concept of a _",
    "kinematic metric _",
    "@xmath35 on the configuration space @xmath0 , in terms of the kinetic energy @xmath36 of the mechanical system .",
    "for example , in the case of an n - body system with total mass @xmath15 @xmath37 now , for a system with kinematic metric @xmath38 , potential function @xmath2 and a given constant total energy @xmath3 , set @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the associated _ dynamical metric_. then by writing @xmath41 jacobi transformed lagrange s action integral ( [ 1 - 4a ] ) into an arc - length integral @xmath42 and hence , in one stroke , the least action principle becomes the following simple geometric statement : @xmath43    nowadays , such metric spaces are called @xmath44 @xmath45 , and the global geometric study of geodesic curves is often referred to as the morse theory of geodesics . in particular , we note that the dynamical metric @xmath40 is a conformal modification of the underlying kinematic metric @xmath38 .    in this geometric setting , the notion of `` congruence class '' is defined by the action of the rotation group @xmath46 , fixing the center of gravity (= origin ) .",
    "it acts isometrically on the configuration space @xmath47 with the kinematic metric , and also on the modified metric space ( @xmath48 for any @xmath46-invariant potential function @xmath2 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath46-orbit spaces inherit the structure of a ( stratified ) riemannian manifold with the induced _",
    "orbital distance metric _ , which we denote by @xmath49 and similar to ( [ 1 - 6 ] ) , for @xmath3 negative the geodesics must stay inside the hill s region , namely the proper subset @xmath50    by definition , the projection map @xmath51 is a ( stratified ) riemannian submersion , where the _ horizontal _ tangent vectors at @xmath52 @xmath0 are those perpendicular to the @xmath46-orbit .",
    "they are mapped , by the tangent map @xmath53 , isometrically to the tangent space of @xmath54 at @xmath55 . via the map",
    "@xmath56 there is a 1 - 1 correspondence between curves @xmath57 in @xmath32 and their horizontal lifting @xmath58 in @xmath0 ( resp .",
    "@xmath59 , up to congruence .",
    "in fact , for a ( virtual ) motion @xmath27 , the property of being horizontal is equivalent to the vanishing of the angular momentum vector @xmath60 .    on the other hand",
    ", the above metric @xmath61 on @xmath32 also has a kinematic interpretation in analogy with ( [ 1 - 5 ] ) , namely @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the purely rotational energy and hence the difference @xmath64 , representing that of the change of size and shape , is naturally the kinetic energy at the level of @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , we also refer to @xmath65 ( resp .",
    "@xmath66 as the _ kinematic _ ( resp .",
    "_ dynamical _ ) metric on @xmath32 .",
    "classical mechanics , indeed , tells us how the term @xmath63 can be calculated from @xmath67 via the socalled _ inertia operator _ of the system ; in particular , it follows that @xmath68 if and only if @xmath69 .",
    "now , assume @xmath69 and let @xmath2 be a nonnegative and @xmath46-invariant function on @xmath0 .",
    "then it is not difficult to see that both action principles ( [ 1 - 4a ] ) , ( [ 1 - 4b ] ) can be pushed down to @xmath32 . in the first case , using jacobi s reformulation ( [ 1 - 7 ] ) , we arrive immediately at the following geometric statement similar to the one above : @xmath70    in the case of ( [ 1 - 4b ] ) , the lagrange function @xmath71 is also defined at the level of @xmath32 . indeed ,",
    "when @xmath69 we can view @xmath54 as the configuration space for a simple conservative classical mechanical system , namely with potential energy @xmath7 , kinetic energy @xmath36 , and conserved total energy @xmath72 .",
    "it is easy to calculate the associated euler - lagrange equations with respect to suitable coordinates in @xmath32 , as demonstrated in section 3.2 .",
    "finally , the reduced newton s differential equation on @xmath32 can be calculated by the procedure described in hs2 , but we leave this topic here .",
    "the results in this paper provide the foundations for the above riemannian geometric approach to the three - body problem with zero angular momentum .",
    "in section 2 we present the kinematic geometric framework for the reduction method which we shall work out , consisting of the two successive reductions @xmath73 @xmath74 , where @xmath32 @xmath75 is the ( congruence ) moduli space and @xmath76 is the shape space .",
    "the second reduction uses the cone structure of @xmath32 over @xmath77 to eliminate the scaling variable @xmath78 by radial projection to the sphere .",
    "a trajectory @xmath27 in the configuration space @xmath0 projects to its moduli curve @xmath34 in @xmath32 , and away from the base point @xmath79 the curve further projects to the shape curve @xmath80 on the sphere .",
    "conversely , whereas @xmath27 is determined up to congruence by @xmath81 , the real power of the above reduction method rests upon the knowledge of the subtle relationship which , in fact , generally exists between @xmath34 and the geometric ( i.e. unparametrized ) curve @xmath82 .    in reality , the complete study of the three - body trajectories is hereby reduced to the study of the relative geometry between the shape curve @xmath83 and the gradient flow of @xmath84 , namely the newtonian potential function restricted to the 2-sphere @xmath85 .",
    "the major results of the paper are divided into the following four main topics :    * the calculation of the reduced newton s equations in @xmath32 in several ways , such as the geodesic equations of the riemannian space ( @xmath86 , and the reformulation of the geodesic condition in terms of the curvature of the spherical shape curve .",
    "a suitable combination of these equations also yields a separation of the radial variable @xmath87 and hence a third order ode on the 2-sphere which describes all shape curves for any energy level @xmath3 .",
    "the key step in this reduction is lemma [ split ] which relates the intrinsic geometry of @xmath88 to a kinematic quantity of @xmath34 . *",
    "the unique parametrization theorem ( cf .",
    "theorem [ unique ] ) asserts that the time parametrized moduli curve @xmath34 is ( essentially ) determined by the oriented geometric shape curve  @xmath89 .",
    "furthermore , the curve @xmath89 is in fact uniquely determined by the first two curvature coefficients at a generic point on the curve .",
    "the basic technique used here is the local analysis of solution curves via power series expansion .",
    "* the monotonicity theorem ( cf . theorem [ monotone ] ) , which describes a type of piecewise monotonic behavior of the shape curve @xmath89 .",
    "namely , the mass - modified latitude is a strictly monotonic function along @xmath83 between two succeeding local maxima or minima , and they lie on opposite hemispheres . in particular",
    ", the curve intersects the eclipse circle at a unique point between two such local extrema . * some initial applications to the study of triple collisions . in particular ,",
    "simple geometric proofs of the fundamental theorems of sundman and siegel .",
    "moreover , their asymptotic formulae for the derivatives of the moment of inertia @xmath20  up to order two are extended to the derivatives of any order .",
    "the present exposition is based upon previous works of the authors ( cf .",
    "hsiang , @xcite , @xcite ) on the three - body problem , exploring its `` sphericality '' as it manifests itself in various ways .",
    "the differential equations which describe the moduli curves of the three - body trajectories , are elaborated in section 3 and 4 , including a careful power series analysis and comparison of the initial value problems at the moduli space and the shape space level .",
    "section 5 is devoted to a geometric study of the gradient field of @xmath84 , which also yields a simple and purely geometric proof of the monotonicity theorem . a similar type of monotonicity for the shape curves was first proved by montgomery @xcite with his `` infinitely many syzygies '' theorem , and later by fujiwara et al @xcite .",
    "in section 6 we recall the classical results and clarify some issues on the work of sundman and siegel concerning triple collisions .",
    "moreover , with the results obtained so far , many challenging problems , for example in the study of collisions and periodic motions , naturally present themselves for an in depth study of the global geometry of shape curves . some of these open problems will be briefly discussed in section 7 .",
    "a three - body motion with vanishing angular momentum is always confined to a fixed plane ( for purely kinematic reasons ) , so the motions we shall study are always planary .",
    "therefore , we choose a plane @xmath90 @xmath91 with normal vectors @xmath92 and define an _",
    "m - triangle _ to be a triple @xmath93 of vectors @xmath94 constrained by the center of mass condition in ( [ m ] ) .",
    "hence , for our purpose we shall modify the definition ( [ m ] ) of the _ configuration space _ by taking the subspace @xmath95 which consists of the above m - triangles in the fixed plane @xmath90 .",
    "@xmath0 has the natural action of the rotation group @xmath96 , and the _ moduli space _ , representing the @xmath96-congruence classes of m - triangles , is the orbit space @xmath97    the degenerate ( or collinear ) @xmath98-triangles constitute the _ eclipse _ subvariety @xmath99 of @xmath0 , and we say a nondegenerate @xmath98-triangle is _ positively _ ( resp . _ negatively _ ) oriented if @xmath100 is a positive ( resp .",
    "negative ) frame of @xmath101 .",
    "accordingly , we may write @xmath0 and @xmath32 as the disjoint union of three subsets    @xmath102    and moreover , we observe that the moduli space of unoriented m - triangles would be @xmath103    for a study of general ( non - planary ) 3-body motions , the natural configuration space @xmath104 consists of pairs ( @xmath105 ) , where @xmath106 is an m - triangle in @xmath101 and @xmath107 is a unit vector perpendicular to all @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath104 is a 6-dimensional manifold ( a 4-plane bundle over @xmath108 with the natural action of @xmath46 , and now the moduli space coincides with the above one ( cf.@xcite , section 2 ) , namely@xmath109    we shall describe in more detail the topology and induced riemannian structure of the above simple orbit spaces .",
    "let @xmath106 ( as above )  and @xmath110 be @xmath98-triangles .",
    "the following @xmath96-invariant , but mass dependent inner product @xmath111 is just the kinematic metric @xmath38 of @xmath0 defined by ( [ 1 - 5 ] ) . in particular ,",
    "the squared norm is the moment of inertia , @xmath112 .",
    "let @xmath113 @xmath114 be the unit sphere @xmath115 and denote its spherical metric by @xmath116 .",
    "then we can express @xmath0 as the riemannian cone over @xmath117 @xmath118 where @xmath87 measures the distance from the base point ( origin ) of the cone .",
    "a description similar to ( [ 2 - 3 ] ) applies to the moduli space @xmath119 whose `` unit sphere '' @xmath85 @xmath120 is called the _ shape space _ , namely it is the image of @xmath113 in @xmath32 @xmath121 with the induced metric denoted by @xmath122 .",
    "thus , @xmath32 also inherits the structure of a riemannian cone over its `` unit sphere '' @xmath123 with @xmath87 still measuring the distance from the base point @xmath79 .",
    "the shape space is actually isometric to the 2-sphere of radius 1/2 , as follows from the well - known hopf fibration construction @xmath124  _  _ @xmath125    as a cone over @xmath126 , @xmath32 is clearly homeomorphic to @xmath101 with the origin at the base point @xmath79 . away from @xmath79",
    "they are even diffeomorphic , when @xmath32 has the induced smooth functional structure as an orbit space of @xmath127 .",
    "for the convenience of applying vector algebra we also recall the _ euclidean model _ of @xmath32 , where @xmath32 is identified with @xmath128 , with euclidean coordinates @xmath129 and associated spherical coordinates @xmath130 , and the kinematic metric is expressed as the following conformal modification of the standard euclidean metric : @xmath131 here @xmath132 denotes any choice of spherical polar coordinates on the sphere @xmath133 whose induced metric from the euclidean 3-space is that of the round sphere of radius 1 @xmath134 whereas its induced ( i.e. kinematic ) metric as a submanifold of @xmath135 is @xmath136 by ( [ 1 - 9 ] ) and ( [ 2 - 8 ] ) the total kinetic energy can be written as @xmath137 where the rotational term @xmath63 vanishes precisely when @xmath138 . starting from section 3 this is our standing assumption .",
    "the radial distance function @xmath78 is also referred to as the _ hyper - radius _ in the physics literature . for our purpose",
    "it is generally more convenient to use @xmath87 rather than @xmath20 as the scaling parameter , and we shall refer to @xmath139 as a spherical coordinate system of @xmath32 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for the relationships between spherical coordinates , individual moments of inertia @xmath140 , or mutual distances @xmath141 .",
    "in the above euclidean model of kinematic geometry the decomposition in ( 2 - 1b ) has a distinguished equator plane , namely the _ eclipse plane _",
    "@xmath142 which divides @xmath101 into the two half - spaces @xmath143 .",
    "we choose the euclidean coordinates so that @xmath142 is the xy - plane and the half - space @xmath144 represents the congruence classes @xmath145 of the positively oriented m - triangles .",
    "finally , @xmath146 is the distinguished equator or _ eclipse circle _ of the sphere @xmath147 .    on the other hand , the position of the various shapes @xmath148of m - triangles on the sphere is uniquely determined by the position of the three binary collision points @xmath149 , @xmath150 , along the circle @xmath151 , where @xmath152 represents the shape of the degenerate m - triangle with @xmath153 etc .",
    "we are still free to choose the cyclic ordering @xmath154 either in the eastward or westward direction . moreover , the mass distribution and the relative positions of the three points @xmath149 mutually determine each other .",
    "in fact , the angle @xmath155 between @xmath156 and @xmath157 is given by @xmath158 and these formulae can be inverted .",

    "( [ scale ] ) . of course ,",
    "the various geometric quantities , such as velocity , geodesic curvature , gradient etc . must also be scaled appropriately when passing from one model to the other .",
    "in this chapter we shall follow jacobi s geometrization idea at the level of the moduli space @xmath175 .",
    "this enables us to reduce the analysis of 3-body trajectories with zero angular momentum to that of the corresponding moduli curves . according to jacobi , for a given energy level @xmath176 the moduli curves",
    "can be interpreted as the geodesics of a specific riemannian metric @xmath177 on @xmath32 .",
    "now , the standard procedure for the calculation of the geodesic equations amounts to the calculation of the christoffel symbols of the metric , with respect to a suitably chosen coordinate system suggested by the geometry of the space , say . the resulting equations are ordinary differential equations whose solutions are curves parametrized by the arc - length .",
    "the kinematic geometry describes @xmath32 with the scaling and rotational symmetry of a riemannian cone over a sphere , and therefore the spherical coordinates @xmath178 present themselves as the most natural choice . in section 3.1",
    "we shall calculate the associated differential equations .",
    "however , the natural parameter for 3-body trajectories is the physical time @xmath21 , and it is the effective usage of fixed energy that enables us to express the equations in terms of @xmath21 as well , cf .",
    "( [ 3 - 1 ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , in the hamiltonian least action principle the time interval is fixed and @xmath21 is the natural parameter from the outset .",
    "the euler - lagrange equations for the lagrange function @xmath179 on @xmath32 are calculated in section 3.2 , and this approach , in fact , yields the same system ( [ 3 - 1 ] ) in a much simpler way .",
    "however , we also seek a differential equation purely at the shape space level , that is , with the scaling parameter @xmath87 eliminated .",
    "this demands a deeper understanding of the relationship between @xmath87 and the geodesic curvature of the shape curve . to this end",
    "we shall introduce an alternative geometric approach to the study of geodesics in @xmath32 , which takes the full advantage of the spherical symmetry and the cone structure of @xmath32 .",
    "this is the topic of section 3.3 .",
    "finally , in section 3.4 we shall synthesize the results obtained in the previous subsections and , in particular , we explain how the moduli curve can be reconstructed from the shape curve .",
    "we shall calculate the ( standard ) geodesic equations of @xmath181 relative to the spherical coordinates @xmath182 , where @xmath132 denotes a choice of spherical polar coordinates on the shape space @xmath183 .",

    "finally , @xmath244 is the normal field of @xmath245 in @xmath224 . for convenience , we write @xmath246 where @xmath247 denotes the angle between the radial and tangential direction , that is , the angle between @xmath248 and @xmath249 .",
    "let @xmath107 be a vector normal to @xmath57 , say @xmath244 or @xmath250 as above , and let @xmath251 and @xmath252 denote the associated geodesic curvatures of @xmath253 with respect to the metrics @xmath61 and @xmath177 , respectively .",
    "it follows from the first variation formula of arc - length that the curvatures of a given curve with respect to such a pair of conformally related metrics are linked by the following formula @xmath254 there are two cases to analyze , namely @xmath255 or @xmath250 , and for simplicity we write @xmath256 , @xmath257 etc . , and we assume @xmath83 is not a single point .",

    "similarly , let @xmath261 and @xmath262 be the `` surface normal '' geodesic curvatures of @xmath57 with respect to the metrics @xmath263 and @xmath177 , consequently @xmath264    to find an expression for @xmath261 , it is a key observation that the _ principal curvatures _ of @xmath225 in @xmath32 at a given point @xmath265 are the numbers @xmath266 and @xmath267 , where @xmath268 denotes the geodesic curvature of @xmath89 on the sphere @xmath269 at the point @xmath270 .",
    "therefore , by the classical euler s formulas , the _ normal sectional curvature _ of @xmath226 in the tangential direction of @xmath57 is equal to @xmath271    finally , the geodesic condition for @xmath57 in @xmath180 reads @xmath272 which by ( [ 3 - 6])-([3 - 7 ] ) is neatly expressed by two scalar odes . in terms of the kinematic arc - length parameter @xmath273 of @xmath57 , regarded either as a curve in @xmath225 or @xmath32 , we can state the final result as the following theorem :    [ conesurface]let @xmath34 ( resp .",

    "we also deduce the above result from the equations ( ii ) , ( iii ) of ( [ 3 - 1 ] ) , namely @xmath281 and @xmath282 must vanish if @xmath283 and @xmath284 are set to be constant .",
    "ray solutions yield the simplest type of three - body motions , namely the shape invariant or so - called homographic motions , which in the case of @xmath69 are confined to a line .",

    "we shall return to triple collisions and siegel s approach in section 6 .      for convenience ,",
    "let us write @xmath332 and @xmath333 for the basic coordinate vector fields of the spherical coordinate system on the unit sphere . by definition ,",
    "the _ acceleration _ of the spherical curve @xmath334 is the expression @xmath335 which is the covariant derivative of the velocity along the curve , with respect to the metric ( [ round ] ) . by definition , @xmath336 and",

    "consequently , @xmath339    now , take the above sphere and curve to be the shape space @xmath85 and a shape curve @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "then it follows immediately from ( [ c2 ] ) and ( [ 3 - 41 ] ) that the equations ( ii ) and ( iii ) of the system ( [ 3 - 1 ] ) can be expressed neatly as the following coordinate - free vector equation on the 2-sphere , @xmath340 here the scaling variable @xmath78 of the cone @xmath32 plays the role of an auxiliary function which couples equation ( [ 3 - 42 ] ) to equation ( i ) of ( [ 3 - 1 ] ) .",
    "the latter is the lagrange - jacobi equation ( l - j ) , which for a given shape curve @xmath80 is a second order differential equation purely for @xmath285 .",
    "another interpretation of the coefficient of the velocity in ( [ 3 - 42 ] ) follows from ( [ 3 - 10 ] ) , namely we have @xmath341    in fact , the differential equation ( [ 3 - 42 ] ) can be completely decoupled from the function @xmath285 and hence it really becomes a differential equation on the 2-sphere , as summarized in theorem [ shape1 ] below .",
    "the system ( [ 3 - 8a])-([3 - 8b ] ) characterizes the moduli curves of 3-body trajectories with zero angular momentum , expressed in the language of kinematic geometry and , in particular , for that reason the natural parameter is the arc - length @xmath343 of the moduli curve or the arc - length @xmath173 of its image shape curve on the sphere of radius @xmath344 .",
    "although the original mechanical system ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) naturally involves the physical parameter of time @xmath21 , the latter is infinitesimally related to @xmath343 by the identity    @xmath345    and this enables us to express the system ( [ 3 - 8a])-([3 - 8b ] ) in terms of @xmath21 and hence combine it directly with the other system ( [ 3 - 1 ] ) .",
    "to this end , let us consider a shape curve @xmath80 on the sphere @xmath346 .",
    "by ( [ 3 - 10 ] ) , @xmath347 and then equation ( [ 3 - 8b ] ) becomes @xmath348 the latter is not only considerably simpler than equation ( [ 3 - 8b ] ) , but it also provides a simple formula to compute @xmath349 in terms of the geometry of the shape curve , namely @xmath350 in view of the integral formula ( [ 3 - 11 ] ) this is , indeed , a pleasant surprise which , in one stroke , shows how to reconstruct the moduli curve @xmath351 from the shape curve @xmath80 by the simple formula ( [ 3 - 14 ] ) .",
    "the expression on the right hand side of ( [ 3 - 14 ] ) refers to the kinematic geometry with @xmath352 , and the whole product on this side would change by the factor @xmath353 if we had worked in the sphere @xmath170 .",
    "henceforth , we shall return to the unit sphere @xmath294 , and with the notation for speed , curvature and normal derivative from section 3.4.1 we can restate ( [ 3 - 14 ] ) in the following way :    [ split]let @xmath323 be the siegel function ( [ c10 ] ) of @xmath88 , which relates the intrinsic geometry of @xmath83 with the gradient field @xmath354 on the unit 2-sphere . if @xmath355 is the time - parametrized moduli curve of a three - body motion with zero angular momentum , then the speed @xmath356 of @xmath80 is related to @xmath285 and @xmath357 by the identity @xmath358 @xmath359 in particular , @xmath323 is always nonnegative !    now , returning to equation ( [ 3 - 42 ] ) we set @xmath360 where the rightmost identity in ( [ 3 - 17a ] ) follows from ( logarithmic ) differentiation of the identity ( [ 3 - 16 ] ) .",
    "then we can state the following result :    [ shape1]for 3-body motions with zero angular momentum and fixed total energy , the associated shape curves @xmath80 on the unit 2-sphere are characterized by the ode @xmath361 where the first term is the ( covariant ) acceleration and the coefficients are the functions @xmath362 defined by ( [ 3 - 17a ] ) , ( [ 3 - 17b ] ) , which can be expressed purely in terms of @xmath363 , @xmath284 and their derivatives up to order 3 .    the formula ( [ 3 - 16 ] ) , or equivalently @xmath364 expresses the geodesic curvature of the shape curve in terms of @xmath365 . therefore , since it only involves first order derivatives in the moduli space , it is not surprising to find that the same formula can , indeed , be derived more directly from the general spherical curvature formula ( [ c6 ] ) by elimination of the second order derivatives using equations ( ii ) , ( iii ) in ( [ 3 - 1 ] ) .",
    "the formula for @xmath366 in ( [ 3 - 16 ] ) involves the three quantities @xmath367 and @xmath311 and the product may become indefinite when some of them vanish , namely we note the following implications @xmath368 & \\longrightarrow\\left [ u_{\\nu}^{\\ast}=0\\right ] \\longleftarrow\\left [ k^{\\ast}=0\\right ]   \\label{implications } \\\\ \\left [ u_{\\nu}^{\\ast}=0\\right ] & \\longrightarrow\\left [ v=0\\right ] \\text { \\ or } \\left [ k^{\\ast}=0\\right ]   \\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is worthwhile having a closer look at the geometric interpretation and behavior of the shape curve due to the vanishing of any of these numbers , and accordingly we shall make some definitions to distinguish the various cases .    formula ( [ 3 - 16 ] ) expresses the siegel function @xmath323 of @xmath83 in two different ways , namely at a point @xmath369 its value is @xmath370 whenever any of the limits are defined , including @xmath371 as a limiting value .",
    "[ regular]@xmath372 is a _ regular _ point if @xmath373 , and otherwise it is _ irregular . _",
    "the irregular points consist of the _ cusps _ , the _ collision _ _ points _ ( binary or triple ) , and for completeness we also include _ escape points : _ _  _ @xmath374 in section 6 we shall return to triple collisions , but binary collisions and escape to infinity behavior will not be a topic in this paper .",
    "the simplest curves on the 2-sphere are the geodesic circles , characterized by @xmath375 at each point .",
    "if such a curve is the shape curve of a three - body motion , then it follows from ( [ 2lim ] ) that @xmath320 also vanishes .",
    "in fact , @xmath89 coincides with a gradient line segment if and only if it is a geodesic .    [ exceptional]the shape curve @xmath89 is called _ exceptional _ if it is confined to a gradient line ( or a geodesic circle ) , or it consists of a single point .",
    "clearly , a single point shape curve must be a fixpoint of the gradient flow , see remark [ shape ] .",
    "thus , apart from the exceptional shape curves , being a regular or irregular point is an intrinsic property , that is , it depends only on the geometric curve .    [ exc]we omit the proof here , so we rather claim that the only exceptional shape curves ( of length 0 ) are those representing collinear motions or _",
    "isosceles _ _ triangle _ motions .",
    "their crucial property is that the shape curve lies on a circle fixed by an isometry ( reflection ) of the sphere which leaves @xmath84 invariant .",
    "it also follows that a non - exceptional shape curve @xmath89 can only intersect an exceptional curve transversely , that is , neither tangentially nor with zero speed .",
    "the equator circle @xmath376 represents the collinear motions , of course , but isosceles motions exist only for special mass distributions , as follows .",
    "an isosceles m - triangle has ( at least ) two equal masses , say @xmath377 , and the mass @xmath378 lies on the symmetry axis of the triangle .",
    "their shapes constitute the meridian through the north pole , the euler point @xmath379 and its antipodal point @xmath380 .",
    "the latter point represents the collision of the two symmetric mass points somewhere on the symmetry axis .",
    "thus , an isosceles triangle motion arises when the initial position and velocity have the above isosceles symmetry .",
    "henceforth , we shall assume the shape curve @xmath89 is not of exceptional type , unless otherwise stated .",
    "consider the power series expansions    @xmath381    at a regular point @xmath382 , where @xmath324 is the arc - length measured from @xmath372 .",

    "then @xmath388 for @xmath389 , @xmath390 , and we say @xmath372 is a _ regular point _ of order @xmath391 .",
    "it is a finite number since otherwise @xmath392 and @xmath311 vanishes identically and @xmath89 would be exceptional . in particular , we see that @xmath393 means @xmath394 is transversal to the gradient flow at @xmath395    the _ order _ @xmath391 of a cusp at @xmath372 @xmath396 can be defined similarly by considering the limits in ( [ lim ] ) .",
    "the only difference is that @xmath397 and @xmath387 at the last step .",
    "cusps arise when the moduli curve @xmath34 in @xmath32  is tangent to the ray at the point @xmath398 and hence the projected curve @xmath394 on the 2-sphere `` halts '' at @xmath399 .",
    "geometrically , the curve @xmath89 near @xmath372 is a cusp consisting of two diverging branches which emanate from @xmath372 , both with the initial direction of @xmath400 and the initial curvature @xmath401 in remark [ cusp ] we further describe the totality of cusps at @xmath372 , at a fixed energy level @xmath3 , as a specific family of curves @xmath89 parametrized by a number @xmath402 ( resp .",

    "we choose an initial point @xmath412 on the shape curve , and assume ( for simplicity ) it is regular in the sense of definition [ regular ] .",
    "in particular , the ( local ) lifting procedure is well defined , and the corresponding initial value problems for the ode s ( [ 3 - 1 ] ) and ( [ 3 - 43 ] ) respectively , are equivalent .",
    "thus , on the one hand , the solution @xmath34 is uniquely determined by its initial position and velocity @xmath413 but on the other hand it is also determined by the corresponding initial data @xmath414 at the shape space level .    however , the above chosen initial data determine an energy level @xmath3 , and conversely , if @xmath3 is already given , the initial data ( [ 3 - 44 ] ) or ( 3 - 44b ) are acceptable only if the resulting energy level is @xmath3 . to make this more transparent ,",
    "let us rather state the initial value problem in the moduli space as a system with 4 equations : @xmath415 where the first order equation ( iv ) is the energy integral ( [ h ] ) for the fixed value @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , any one of the four equations is redundant and can be deduced from the other three .",
    "for example , with @xmath3 calculated from the initial data ( [ 3 - 44 ] ) , the solution of ( i)-(iii ) also satisfies ( iv ) .    more geometrically , if the initial data set ( [ 3 - 44 ] ) is a point on a specific level surface of type ( iv ) in the tangent bundle of @xmath32 , then the solution @xmath34 of ( i)-(iii ) in ( [ 3 - 45 ] ) must lie on the surface ( iv ) for all @xmath416 but we can also determine the same solution @xmath417 from ( ii)-(iv ) .",
    "all this amounts to saying that for a given value of @xmath3 the whole system ( [ 3 - 45 ] ) is of total order @xmath418    on the other hand , the ode ( [ 3 - 43 ] ) on the 2-sphere is independent of @xmath3 and its total order is 6 .",

    "the exceptions to this subdivision are precisely the exceptional shape curves ( cf . definition [ exceptional ] ) , which can represent three - body motions at any energy level .",
    "see section 4.2 .",
    "now , let us consider the problem of how to translate the initial data ( 3 - 44 ) , at a given energy level @xmath3 , into a set of suitable initial data consisting of five numbers depending only on the shape curve",

    "it is , perhaps , more natural to replace @xmath424 by @xmath425 in ( [ data ] ) .",
    "in fact , the two choices - either @xmath425 or @xmath383 - are equivalent since the direction @xmath426 determines @xmath427 when @xmath423 .    the pairs @xmath428 and ( @xmath429 evidently determine each other , namely they specify the initial velocity of @xmath83 . clearly , the 5-tuple ( [ data ] ) is merely the data ( 3 - 44 ) with the pair ( @xmath430 replaced by the single number @xmath424 , which is a second order quantity at the shape space level .",
    "indeed , we recover @xmath431 immediately from ( [ data ] ) by making use of ( [ lim ] ) .",
    "thus , it is clear that the initial data information given by ( [ 3 - 44 ] ) or ( [ data ] ) would be equivalent if we could also recover the radial speed @xmath432 from ( [ data ] ) .",
    "however , the energy integral ( iv ) of ( [ 3 - 45 ] ) determines only @xmath433 ; in fact , there is no solution at all if @xmath3 is below the critical value@xmath434 there is a unique solution if @xmath435 , with @xmath436 , and for @xmath437 there are two solutions which are distinguished by the sign of @xmath432 .",
    "a slightly different approach is to combine the identities ( [ p ] ) and ( [ 3 - 12 ] ) , which yields a value of @xmath438 , where @xmath439",

    "moreover , we shall assume that @xmath89 is not exceptional and hence the linkage between @xmath89 and @xmath84 is also neatly encoded into the intrinsic siegel function @xmath474 , see ( [ c10 ] ) and section 3.4.4 .",

    "now , we are able to calculate successively each new triple @xmath559 , @xmath560 , expressed in terms of the intrinsic data , as claimed above .",
    "the initial direction , @xmath558 , is the only basic intrinsic data with no invariant description , that is , independent of the coordinate frame .",
    "however , from the recursive procedure it follows that @xmath561 , come out with coordinate free expressions involving only the coefficients in ( [ starseries ] ) .",
    "in fact , we can calculate @xmath562 in terms of @xmath563 @xmath564 and @xmath565 @xmath566 , by repeated differentiation of ( [ 3 - 16 ] ) , next we calculate @xmath567 by applying differential operators such as ( [ c12 ] ) to @xmath84 , and finally @xmath568 is calculated using equation @xmath569 .",
    "the beginning terms are @xmath570      let us first review some of the above facts from the local analysis and then draw a few immediate but important consequences .",
    "the above power series developments amount to the explicit calculation of the solution @xmath571 of the system ( [ 3 - 45 ] ) in the moduli space with the initial data ( [ 3 - 44 ] ) . in doing",
    "so we started from the following 5-tuple @xmath572 where @xmath573 may be replaced by @xmath574 ( or @xmath575 , for the smallest @xmath391 with @xmath576 which consists of three specific intrinsic local geometric invariants at the point @xmath577 on the shape curve .",
    "in particular , we also recover the time parametrized shape curve @xmath80 by projecting @xmath351 to the 2-sphere .",
    "actually , since @xmath34 is uniquely determined by the initial value problem , ( [ 3 - 44 ] ) and ( [ 3 - 45 ] ) , it suffices to recover ( 3 - 44 ) from ( [ 5-data ] ) , namely the missing information in ( [ 3 - 44 ] ) is @xmath431 and @xmath556 .",
    "this turns out to be possible when @xmath5 , but for a `` good '' reason ( see below ) it is impossible when @xmath6 since in this case the shape curve only controls the product @xmath578 @xmath579 . in any case , with the quantity @xmath580 we can actually determine @xmath556 and , in particular , the question in problem [ index ] concerning the expansion index is settled .",
    "the general three - body problem has the 10 classical conservation laws ( linear and angular momentum , and energy ) due to its invariance under the galilean symmetry group .",
    "all of them have been used and , in particular , the set of solutions is invariant under time translation , @xmath581 , as well as reversal of time ( @xmath582 ) which reverses the direction of the trajectory .",
    "however , there is also an additional 1-parameter size / time scaling symmetry group , whose induced action on parametrized moduli curves sends @xmath355 to @xmath583 and changes the energy from @xmath3 to @xmath584 . in particular , although scaling and time translation leaves the oriented shape curve geometrically unchanged , its time parametrization is subject to an affine transformation@xmath585 since the energy level @xmath6 is scaling invariant , this also explains why the reconstruction of a unique initial size @xmath431 fails when @xmath6 .    for any @xmath586",
    "the newtonian n - body problem has the above 1-parameter symmetry group @xmath587 , acting on size and time but leaves the shape invariant .",
    "for example , for a periodic motion with period @xmath588 and average ( or initial ) size @xmath589 , the group sweeps out a periodic motion with the same shape , and the ratio @xmath590 is independent of @xmath591 .",
    "the case @xmath592 means the restricted case @xmath593 with one of the masses ( e.g. a planet ) infinitesimal small , in which case there is only one shape ( a point ) and the above ratio depends only on the large mass ( the sun ) .",
    "this gives kepler s third law , so the above symmetry group is essentially the generalization of this law .",
    "on the other hand , for three - body motions with vanishing angular momentum , the identity @xmath594 @xmath595 of ( [ 3 - 16 ] ) gives another quantity , @xmath594 , which is invariant under the above symmetry group .",
    "a time reparametrization of @xmath34 or @xmath80 by an affine transformation ( [ aff ] ) , for any @xmath596 , is called _ canonical _ , otherwise it is called _ exceptional_. _  _    of course , in order to stay at a given nonzero energy level a canonical reparametrization must have @xmath597 , and moreover , the orientation of the curve is reversed if @xmath598 .",
    "now we can state the following basic _ unique parametrization theorem _ :    [ unique ] a three - body motion with zero angular momentum is , up to congruence and canonical reparametrization , uniquely determined by its oriented shape curve on the 2-sphere . in fact , it suffices to know the direction and the first two siegel numbers @xmath599 at any regular point on the shape curve . in particular , there are no exceptional reparametrizations .",
    "as shown before , the theorem still holds with @xmath600 replaced by the curvature numbers @xmath601 if the point is regular of order 0 , and this is , indeed , the generic type of points",
    ".    a curve on the 2-sphere which is the shape curve of a motion with total energy @xmath3 can also be the shape curve for some motion with any other energy @xmath602 of the same sign as @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , we find the other motions by suitable canonical reparametrizations of the given motion , and by ( [ 3id ] ) it also follows that the sign of @xmath3 ( viewed as a number @xmath603 is an intrinsic invariant at the shape space level .",
    "more precisely , we have the following quantitative measurement of the energy type :    let @xmath89 be a geometric curve on the 2-sphere , with the siegel function @xmath323 ( with respect to @xmath84 , as usual ) , and consider the function @xmath604 ^{2}+1)-u^{\\ast}\\ ] ] along the curve , where @xmath605 denotes the tangential derivative . if @xmath89 can be realized as the shape curve of a three - body motion with vanishing angular momentum , then the sign of @xmath606 is constant along the curve ( whenever @xmath606 is defined ) , namely equal to the sign of the total energy @xmath3 of the motion .",
    "a given oriented ( geometric ) curve on the 2-sphere can be time parametrized in at most one way , up to canonical reparametrization , as the shape curve @xmath607 of a three - body motion with zero angular momentum .",
    "moreover , the sign of the total energy of such a motion is determined by the local relative geometry of @xmath608 at a ( regular ) point .    the above uniqueness property of time parametrization of geometric shape curves , the minimal amount of geometric information needed to determine the shape curve , and the monotonicity theorem which we shall discuss in section 5 , are our basic tools for the understanding of both the local and global picture of shape curves representing three - body motions with vanishing angular momentum .",
    "the monotonicity property tells us the _ m - latitude _ function is monotonic increasing or decreasing until the curve turns back somewhere in the opposite hemisphere .",
    "thus the curve resembles an `` oscillating motion '' between the upper and lower hemisphere which never stops , unless it ends at a triple collision or escapes to infinity .",
    "the curve crosses the equator circle transversely , or it goes to a binary collision and bounces back ( via regularization ) to the same hemisphere . in section 7.5 we describe the problem of how to construct such a curve by linking together its maximal monotonic segments .",
    "the analysis of trajectories , moduli curves or shape curves describing three - body motions depends , of course , ultimately on the function @xmath84 , whose behavior is largely reflected by the geometry of its gradient field . in this subsection",
    "some useful facts are established which are beyond those simpler statements concerning the critical or singular points of @xmath84 .",
    "we shall apply vector algebra in the euclidean model for the moduli space , namely with @xmath175 as the euclidean space ( cf .",
    "section 2 ) and vectors denoted by boldface letters .",
    "thus the shape space @xmath85 @xmath609 consists of unit vectors @xmath610 , and @xmath611 denotes the usual inner product . set @xmath612 where @xmath613 is the angle between the binary collision points @xmath614 and @xmath615 . the newtonian shape potential function is the restriction of @xmath2 to the above 2-sphere , @xmath616 where the mutual distances @xmath617 are normalized to @xmath618 , and hence by a formula of lagrange @xmath619    the basic behavior of @xmath84 is , of course , given by the 8 special points on the 2-sphere , namely @xmath620 where the first six are cyclically ordered ( eastward ) along the equator circle @xmath376 representing degenerate m - triangles .",
    "the @xmath149 are poles where @xmath84 tends to @xmath621 , and the euler points @xmath622 are the saddle points .",
    "finally , the remaining two are the minima , say @xmath623 lies on the northern hemisphere and @xmath624 is the symmetric ( mirror ) image with respect to the equator plane .",
    "we can also use the points @xmath149 to describe the gradient field , as follows .",
    "let @xmath625 be an arbitrary infinitesimal vector perpendicular to @xmath168 ( i.e. @xmath626 .",
    "then , on the one hand @xmath627 and on the other hand , @xmath628 set @xmath629 then it follows from ( [ 4 - 3 ] ) and ( [ 4 - 4 ] ) that the gradient of the function @xmath84 is the orthogonal projection of the vector @xmath630 to the tangent plane of the sphere at @xmath168 , namely @xmath631    the characterization of the critical points of @xmath84 is , of course , well known .",
    "however , with the following lemma we also like to establish the identity ( [ 4 - 6 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath623 and @xmath632 represent the pair of equilateral m - triangles with @xmath618 and with opposite orientations .",
    "then @xmath633 and @xmath632 are the minima of @xmath84 , and moreover @xmath634    the determination of the critical points away from the equator follows readily by lagrange s multiplier method in @xmath32 with the constraint @xmath635 .",
    "as coordinates we can , for example , use the individual moments of inertia @xmath636 , but the calculations are simplest in terms of the mutual distances @xmath637 using ( [ 4 - 2 ] ) and ( [ 4 - 2a ] ) .",
    "this shows the minimum @xmath638 of @xmath84 ( on any of the hemispheres ) satisfies the following set of equations with a multiplier @xmath639 @xmath640 and hence , by ( [ 4 - 2a ] ) , all the sides @xmath641 are equal to @xmath642 .",
    "moreover , by ( [ 4 - 2 ] ) @xmath643 and this gives ( [ 4 - 6 ] ) .",

    "then @xmath960 as @xmath961",
    ".    finally , we turn to the proof of the asymptotic formulae ( [ 5 - 23 ] ) .",
    "the `` initial '' data needed to start up are provided by proposition [ lower ] and ( [ 6 - 2 ] ) , which by lemma [ equiv ] and ( [ 5 - 25 ] ) can be restated as @xmath962 then , by equation ( [ 5 - 33 ] ) , we first deduce @xmath963 , or equivalently @xmath964 for each @xmath768 .",
    "moreover , by ( [ 5 - 34 ] ) each @xmath965 is bounded , @xmath929 is bounded and hence @xmath966 has a lower bound when @xmath967 .",
    "it follows that all partial derivatives of @xmath929 , with respect to components of @xmath968 and of any order , are bounded ( as functions of @xmath969 .",
    "in particular , in equation ( [ 5 - 32 ] ) @xmath970 is bounded and hence also @xmath971 is bounded .",
    "now , apply the operator @xmath933 repeatedly to the equation ( [ 5 - 32 ] ) and deduce @xmath972 by the above tauberian lemma it follows that @xmath973 similarly , apply @xmath933 successively to the equation ( [ 5 - 33 ] ) and deduce that the highest derivative of @xmath974 is always bounded , hence by the tauberian lemma @xmath975 by the equivalence ( [ 5 - 25 ] ) and lemma [ equiv ] , the statement ( 5 - 35 ) is equivalent to the statement of ( [ 5 - 23 ] ) , and this completes the proof of theorem [ higher ] .",
    "the asymptotic estimates in theorem [ higher ] are also valid for a general collision ( i.e. total collapse ) of an n - body motion , for any @xmath976 .",
    "the proof is esssentially the same as above and the previous subsection , since we have used only the riemannian cone structure of the moduli space @xmath54 and , for example , the angle @xmath247 is similarly defined for any @xmath977 . in fact , the actual structure of the shape space is irrelevant as far as the asymptotic behavior of the radial motion is concerned . moreover ,",
    "the exponent @xmath978 of @xmath21 in the formula @xmath979 is independent of @xmath503 , but depends on the degree @xmath980 of homogenity of the potential function , @xmath981 , namely @xmath982 where we assume @xmath983 , and @xmath984 is the newtonian case .",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "in this concluding section we shall formulate and explain some natural open problems in the present geometric setting . recall that the trajectories of 3-body motions with zero angular momentum are already uniquely determined up to congruence by their associated moduli curves , which can be characterized ( geometrically ) as geodesic curves in @xmath235 .",
    "furthermore , these geodesics together with their time evolution are essentially determined by their shape curve on the 2-sphere .",
    "finally , we recall two major results concerning shape curves , namely the unique parametrization theorem and the monotone m - latitude theorem ( cf . section 4.2 and 5.3 ) . therefore ,",
    "from now on shape curve means geometric shape curve , unless otherwise specified , and we also assume they are oriented .",
    "the study of periodic orbits is naturally a central topic of the 3-body problem as a whole . clearly , the moduli curve and the shape curve of such a motion are periodic , but the converse may not be true .",
    "therefore , we say the three - body motion is _ congruence periodic _ or _ shape periodic _ if the moduli curve or shape curve , respectively , is periodic with respect to time",
    ". however , it is an important consequence of the unique parametrization property that the time parametrization of these curves is dictated by the geometry of the shape curve , whenever the latter is non - exceptional .",
    "then the notion of congruence periodic is the same as shape periodic , and this means the shape curve is _ periodic _ in a geometric sense which we explain as follows .",
    "since it is natural to allow binary collision points , periodic shape curves can be characterized as the topologically _ closed _ shape curves .",
    "namely , the curve is either the immersion of a circle , and we call it _ circular periodic _ , or the immersion of a closed interval ( of length 0 ) and is contractible , and we call it _ string periodic . _ in the latter case the curve is a `` string '' with two end points which are either a reversing cusp ( i.e. at the hills s boundary ) or a collision point , and in order to qualify as a periodic curve it is tacitly assumed we take two copies of the `` string '' with the opposite orientation .",
    "a shape curve consisting of a single point @xmath985 is an exceptional case , and there are additional string periodic moduli curves of the fixed shape @xmath985 .",
    "namely , @xmath985 must be a lagrange or an euler point , and the ray solution with negative energy , starting at rest from @xmath986 on the hill s boundary ( cf .",
    "section 7.4 ) , leads directly to the triple collision point @xmath79 .",
    "by traversing this ray segment in both directions we obtain a string periodic moduli curve .",
    "next , we shall describe the distinction between periodic three - body motions and shape periodic motions ( i.e. of circular or string type ) .",
    "let @xmath83 be a closed ( piecewise smooth ) curve on the 2-sphere which is the shape curve of a motion @xmath987 @xmath988 , of m - triangles with vanishing angular momentum , and assume @xmath89 is periodic as above .",
    "then @xmath989 and @xmath990 are congruent m - triangles and hence differ only by a rotation angle @xmath991 , which we can calculate as a line integral along the shape curve , according to the kinematic gauss - bonnet theorem , see ( [ devi ] ) .    in particular",
    ", @xmath991 is zero if the shape curve is string periodic , and hence the given motion @xmath27 must also be periodic .",
    "thus the notions of `` periodic '' and `` shape periodic '' are identical in this case . on the other hand ,",
    "a circular periodic curve @xmath89 encloses a signed area @xmath992 ( depending on orientation and self - intersections ) , and the above line integral can also be expressed as a surface integral which yields @xmath993 therefore , the motion @xmath27 is periodic if and only if the angle ( angle ) is a rational multiple of @xmath994 , say @xmath995 with @xmath996 , and hence the number @xmath997 is the period of the motion .",
    "thus the study of periodic 3-body trajectories is completely reduced to the study of closed shape curves on the 2-sphere , and it is a challenge to describe or characterize the various types of these curves in terms of simple geometric invariants .",
    "for example , due to the monotonicity theorem it is natural to regard the number of eclipse points ( counted with multiplicity ) as a measure of the complexity of the curve , hence the simplest curves are characterized by a small number of eclipse points .",
    "what is the minimal number of eclipse points on a ( string or circular ) periodic shape curve ?",
    "what even numbers can be realized ?",
    "what are those periodic curves with a small number of eclipse points , say up to 10 ?        we propose to define the _ chaoticity _ of @xmath89 to be the following value @xmath1001 where @xmath1002 is the closure of the set @xmath82 , and we say @xmath89 is _ chaotic _ or _ non - chaotic _ if @xmath1003 or @xmath1004 , respectively .",
    "the works of sundman and siegel show that triple collisions is the only type of _ essential singularity _ of 3-body motions , while the binary collisions can be regularized analytically @xcite , @xcite . recall that the singularities of the newtonian potential function @xmath2 in the moduli space @xmath236 consists of the triple of rays @xmath1005 , where the base point ( or origin ) @xmath79 represents the triple collision and the rays represent the three types of binary collisions .",
    "moreover , the moduli curves of triple collision motions with total energy @xmath3 are exactly those geodesic curves in @xmath1006 with the point @xmath79 as a limit .",
    "the following are some pertinent problems on the geometry of such geodesics .      by the scaling symmetry",
    "we may assume @xmath1008 , where the case of @xmath1009 is most difficult and also most interesting .",
    "the existence of such a shortest geodesic curve between @xmath79 and a given point @xmath985 in @xmath180 can be proved by hilbert s direct method when @xmath6 or @xmath172 , whereas for the case of @xmath1009 the existence will depend on the position of @xmath985 in the hill s region @xmath180 .",
    "note that hilbert s direct method also applies for those @xmath985 with @xmath1010    the uniqueness problem is , however , much more interesting than the existence problem , but it is also much more difficult and subtle . for a geodesic @xmath245",
    "starting from @xmath79 , the question is how far out @xmath57 is the unique shortest geodesic from @xmath79 .",
    "we remark that for points lying in the eclipse plane , the shortest geodesic is not in the eclipse plane , and hence the limiting shape at @xmath79 of the shortest geodesic must be a lagrange point , say @xmath623 . by the monotonicity of its shape curve @xmath245",
    "will eventually reach the eclipse plane , but after the first eclipse @xmath57 ceases to be of shortest length .",
    "hence , the best we can hope for is uniqueness up to the first eclipse point .",
    "we propose to investigate first the case of @xmath6 , due to the scaling invariance of this energy level .",
    "then the general uniqueness of a shortest geodesic between any point @xmath985 and @xmath79 reduces to the uniqueness for eclipse points @xmath985 lying at the distance @xmath163 from @xmath79 , namely for points on the eclipse circle @xmath376 .",
    "thus the problem is reduced from the moduli space @xmath32 to the shape space @xmath85 , namely we ask about the uniqueness of such shape curves between points on @xmath376 and @xmath623 .    for the case of energy level @xmath6 and for a given mass distribution ,",
    "let _ s _ be the set of triple collision moduli curves emanating from @xmath79 , whose shape curve starts out from the lagrange point @xmath623 on the upper hemisphere of @xmath183 .",
    "let _ _ s__@xmath1011 be the initial arcs of the shape curves from @xmath623 ( but @xmath623 not included ) to their first point on the equator circle @xmath376 .",
    "is the family of curves _",
    "_ s__@xmath1011 a foliation of the punctured upper hemisphere @xmath1012 ?    in the case that there exists a unique shortest geodesic in @xmath1013 linking a given m - triangle @xmath106 to the collapsed m - triangle @xmath79 , it is certainly interesting to actually estimate its _ length , initial direction _ and total _ rotation angle _ of the triangle in terms of its geometric invariants .",
    "see also the last part of section 6.2 .",
    "the base point @xmath79 is , of course , the only singularity for @xmath1014 .",
    "but the riemannian manifold @xmath235 has another kind of _ singularity _ along the triple of rays @xmath1005 minus the initial point @xmath1015 , say , of _ binary collision _ type .",
    "one expects that understanding of the geometry of geodesic curves in the vicinity of this type of singularity will be an important topic in the study of the global geometry of geodesics on @xmath235 .",
    "let us make some further remarks . in the vicinity of the ray @xmath1016 the gradient vector field @xmath1017",
    "is closely approximated by the field @xmath1018 , where @xmath1019 and @xmath1020 is the distance in @xmath1014 between @xmath1021 and the ray @xmath1022 , cf .",
    "( [ 2 - 11 ] ) .",
    "thus , there is a suitable rotationally symmetric metric which provides a good approximation of @xmath177 when we are close to such a ray singularity .",
    "application of noether s theorem to this simpler metric yields a _ first integral _ of its geodesic equation which is almost constant along a geodesic segment of @xmath235 near @xmath1022 .",
    "this will serve as a useful _ auxiliary _ function whose analysis will provide an effective control on the above local geometry .",
    "in the case of negative energy , say @xmath1009 , the variety @xmath180 is the _ hill s region _ , namely the proper subset of the moduli space from which the moduli curves of the three - body motions can not leave .",
    "the region is enclosed by its boundary , namely hill s surface @xmath409 which is the smooth surface defined by @xmath1023 , with the ( kinematic ) gradient field @xmath1017 as a normal field .    here",
    "we shall focus on those geodesics of the metric @xmath177 starting at the surface @xmath409 , where the metric becomes identically zero .",
    "hence , a curve lying on @xmath409 has zero length , and a minimizing curve containing a segment on @xmath409 is only _ virtual _ and can not , of course , represent an actual trajectory of a 3-body motion .",
    "therefore , in the study of variational problems of this kind one often needs a certain estimate or geometrical control of those geodesic curves starting at @xmath409 , that is , the moduli curves of those 3-body motions with no kinetic energy at @xmath399 .",
    "they constitute a family @xmath1024 of geodesics parametrized by their initial points @xmath1025 .    following jacobi , it is natural to study the variational vector fields along @xmath1026 with respect to variations within the above family of geodesics .",
    "these vector fields are solutions of the jacobi equation along @xmath1027 with their initial vectors belonging to @xmath1028 .",
    "let @xmath1029 be a generic point of @xmath1030 , and let @xmath1031 be the geodesic curve with initial point @xmath1029 .",
    "how do we obtain an effective ( that is , simple and useful ) lower bound estimate of the distance between @xmath1029 and the first zero point of jacobi vector fields of the above type , in terms of the geometric invariants at @xmath1029 ?      for a fixed energy level @xmath1008 , consider the family @xmath1032 of all oriented geometric shape curves , with the exceptional ones removed , of three - body motions with zero angular momentum . according to the monotone m - latitude theorem",
    "the curve @xmath89 can be viewed as a union of its segments @xmath1033 @xmath1034 , between two consecutive points @xmath1035 and @xmath1036 of extremal m - latitude .",
    "we shall refer to them as the _ fundamental segments_. thus the end points @xmath1037 lie on opposite hemispheres , unless one of them is a binary collision point ( and hence lies on the equator circle ) , and moreover , the m - latitude is strictly monotonic along the segment . clearly , a global shape curve can be regarded as being pieced together by such fundamental segments , and a periodic shape curve has only a finite number of them .",
    "conversely , we may try to construct curves by connecting @xmath1033 to @xmath1038 in a `` smooth '' way . here",
    "@xmath1033 and @xmath1038 belong to @xmath1032 , so `` smooth '' means their union also belongs to @xmath1032 . for simplicity , assume we are using only _ regular _ fundamental segments @xmath1039 , that is , @xmath985 and @xmath938 are regular points .",
    "observe that @xmath1040 is tangential to the m - latitude circle at @xmath985 , so its direction will be completely specified by an index @xmath1041 representing `` eastward '' or `` westward '' respectively .",
    "thus we can associate to the starting point @xmath985 @xmath1042 the following 5-tuple of numbers@xmath1043 = ( \\varphi,\\theta,\\mathfrak{s}_{0},\\mathfrak{s}% _ { 1},\\varepsilon )    \\label{5-tuple}\\ ] ] which determines @xmath1040 completely and therefore also the 5-tuple @xmath1044 $ ] associated to its end point . in ( [ 5-tuple ] ) @xmath1045 are the siegel numbers of @xmath1040 at @xmath985 , as explained in section 4.1 and 4.2 .    roughly speaking ,",
    "the relationship between the initial data and terminal data for a fundamental segment with regular end points provides a type of correspondence@xmath1046 = ( \\varphi,\\theta,\\mathfrak{s}_{0},\\mathfrak{s}% _ { 1},\\varepsilon)\\rightarrow\\left [ q\\right ] = ( \\pi-\\varphi^{\\prime},\\theta^{% \\prime},\\mathfrak{s}_{0}^{\\prime},\\mathfrak{s}_{1}^{\\prime } , \\varepsilon^{\\prime})\\text{\\ } \\ ] ] on a dense open set of @xmath1047 @xmath1048 . moreover , since @xmath985 and @xmath938 are points on opposite hemispheres , let us compose the above correspondence with the reflectional symmetry with respect to the equator circle , namely we replace @xmath1044 $ ] by @xmath1049 = ( \\varphi^{\\prime},\\theta^{\\prime } , % \\mathfrak{s}_{0}^{\\prime},\\mathfrak{s}_{1}^{\\prime},\\varepsilon^{\\prime})$ ] .",
    "finally , we assume @xmath985 ( and hence also @xmath1050 ) lies on the upper hemisphere , thus arriving at the _ _",
    "fundamental correspondence__@xmath1051 \\rightarrow\\left [ p^{\\prime}% \\right ]    \\label{dyn}\\ ] ] _ _  _ _ where the @xmath1052 are identical copies of the 4-dimensional space @xmath1053 . the correspondence is defined on a dense , open set , where it is also invertible .",
    "in fact , with some more labour it would be possible to extend the fundamental correspondence to include irregular points ( i.e. cusps and collisions ) as well .",
    "a periodic shape curve is the assemblage of a finite number of fundamental segments whose initial data constitute a periodic orbit of the above correspondence ( [ dyn ] ) .",
    "namely , if @xmath1054 $ ] has even order @xmath1055 , then the orbit of @xmath1054 $ ] defines @xmath1055 fundamental segments which join together to a periodic curve . on the other hand ,",
    "if the order is @xmath1056 , then the end of the curve lies in the southern hemisphere , so by running through the orbit twice the order will be @xmath1057 , and the associated curve will be periodic ."
