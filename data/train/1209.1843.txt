    "let us label as @xmath8 and @xmath9 the travelling modes of the two input photons . in a photon - number notation ,",
    "the two photon states are taken to be the following ( for simplicity we consider here the case of two independent input qubits , but the results are valid also in the more general entangled case ) : @xmath31 the qubit `` unfolding '' step corresponds to adding two empty modes for photon @xmath9 and rearranging the four modes so as to obtain the following state : @xmath32 the first two @xmath9 modes are then treated as one qubit ( @xmath18 ) and the final two @xmath9 modes as a second qubit ( @xmath19 ) , both of them initialized to logical zero , but with the possibility for each of them to be actually empty .",
    "each of these qubits must now be subject to a cnot gate , using the same @xmath8 qubit as control .",
    "the action of the cnot gate in the photon - number notation is described by the following equations : @xmath45 however , in the present implementation of the quantum fusion we need to have the cnot act also on `` empty target qubits '' , that is vacuum states . for these",
    "we assume the following behavior : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a possible complex amplitude rescaling relative to the non - vacuum case .",
    "a unitary cnot must have @xmath48 , but probabilistic implementations do not have this requirement .",
    "the qubit fusion scheme works if the two cnots have the same @xmath47 .",
    "in particular the cnots implementation proposed by pittman et al .",
    "( refs .  26 - 27 of main article ) and used in this work have @xmath49 , so for brevity we will remove @xmath47 in the following expressions .",
    "let us now consider the entire input state given in eqs .",
    "( [ inputn ] ) : @xmath50 where we have also split the overall four - dimensional target state in the two target qubits @xmath18 and @xmath19 which will be subject to the two cnot gates with the same control @xmath8 .",
    "the subsequent application of the two cnot gates , one acting on @xmath8 and @xmath18 and the other acting on @xmath8 and @xmath19 , leads to the following state : @xmath51 if now we project this state on @xmath52 , so as to erase the @xmath8 qubit , and reunite the @xmath18 and @xmath19 kets , we obtain @xmath53 which is the same as eq .",
    "( 5 ) of the main article .",
    "since the @xmath8 qubit measurement has a probability of 50% of obtaining @xmath33 , without feed - forward the described method has a success probability of 50% not considering the cnot success probability .",
    "if the outcome of the @xmath8 measurement is @xmath54 , we obtain the following target state : @xmath55 this state can be transformed back into eq .",
    "( [ outputn ] ) by a suitable unitary transformaton .",
    "therefore , the success probability of the fusion scheme can be raised to 100% ( again not considering cnots success probabilities ) by a feed - forward mechanism .",
    "in this section , the quantum process taking place in the quantum fusion setup is calculated step by step , considering the ideal case of perfectly identical photons . in a following section , we will consider also the effect of a partial distinguishability of the photons .",
    "the optical layout is shown in figure [ figscheme ] ( or fig .  2 of the main text ) .",
    "we label as @xmath8 and @xmath9 the input modes of the two photons to be fused and @xmath17 the ancilla photon mode . by convention",
    ", the intermediate and output modes in the setup are given the same label in the parallel transmission through optical components , except for the unfolding step which splits mode @xmath9 into modes @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the input qubits are polarization - encoded photons , with horizontal @xmath1 and vertical @xmath2 linear polarizations standing for logical 0 and 1 , respectively .",
    "the output `` fused ''",
    "photon will be finally encoded in two spatial modes , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and the corresponding @xmath56 polarization modes .",
    "the polarizing beam splitters ( pbs ) are assumed to transmit the @xmath1 polarization and reflect the @xmath2 one and not to introduce a phase shift between the two components ( a real pbs may possibly introduce a phase shift , but this can be always compensated with suitable birefringent plates , as was actually done in our experiment ) . the ancilla photon must enter the setup in the @xmath1 polarization state .",
    "the half - wave plates ( hwp ) are all oriented at 22.5@xmath57 with respect to the @xmath1 direction , so as to act as hadamard gates [ @xmath58 , except for the ( yellow - colored in the figure ) one located after the unfolding pbs along the @xmath19 output mode , which is oriented at @xmath22 , so as to perform the transformation @xmath59 .",
    "so as to implement hadamard gates in the polarization space , except for the yellow - colored one which is oriented at @xmath22 so as to be equivalent to a not gate followed by the hadamard one ; single photon detectors ( d ) are used to filter the useful output.,width=264 ]    let us now calculate the behavior of our fusion apparatus .",
    "the three - photon input state is the following : @xmath60 where in the right - hand - side we omit the ket symbols for brevity and we have assumed the @xmath8 and @xmath9 photons to be in an arbitrary two - photon state , either separable or entangled . in particular , the case of separable qubits considered in the main article corresponds to setting @xmath61 , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the coefficient pairs defining the two qubit states .",
    "as we shall see below , the symbols @xmath1 and @xmath2 should be actually taken to represent the photon creation operators ( for the given polarization and spatial mode ) to be applied to the vacuum state , in order to obtain the resulting ket state .",
    "the creation - operator interpretation is needed for the states involving two or more photons in a same mode , which in our case appear only as intermediate states but not in the final output .",
    "we now consider the effect of each optical component in sequence , indicating as subscript(s ) the mode(s ) on which the optical component is acting : @xmath64 @xmath65 \\nonumber\\ ] ] @xmath66 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in the last expression , we introduced the squared symbols @xmath67 or @xmath68 to denote a two - photon state for the given mode ( the precise normalization convention here corresponds to considering the @xmath1 and @xmath2 symbols as creation operators for the given mode acting on vacuum , or equivalently to setting @xmath69 in the photon - number ket notation , and similar ) . continuing with the unfolding step in the @xmath9 mode : @xmath70 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the absence of a symbol for a given mode in a term corresponds to having the vacuum state in that mode ( this again corresponds to the creation - operator notation ) .",
    "next , we have @xmath71   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let us now consider the effect of each of the two pbs acting as cnots .",
    "we will also drop all terms which do not lead to one ( and only one ) output photon in each of the two modes @xmath8 and @xmath17 .",
    "the latter is a projection step ( ps ) ensured by the final photon detection .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath72 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath73 and finally all the exit half - wave plates : @xmath74 by expanding the products , we obtain the following final state : @xmath75 it is clear from this expression that if the detectors of the @xmath17 mode and @xmath8 mode both detect @xmath1 photons , then in the @xmath9 modes we obtain directly the merged photon ( this occurs with a probability of 1/32 ) : @xmath76 the other cases can be transformed into this by a simple feed - forward mechanism : a @xmath2 detection on the @xmath17 channel will indicate that we must apply a @xmath77 operator on the @xmath18 mode , while a @xmath2 detection on the @xmath8 channel indicates that we must apply it on the @xmath19 mode .    by exploiting all cases , we have a total success probability for the fusion of 1/8 . in principle , the scheme may become quasi - deterministic by adopting a klm - like approach with teleportation and a very large number of ancilla photons .",
    "it is remarkable that we could apply the one - ancilla cnot in the first step and the outcome was not ruined by the presence of intermediate double - photon modes .",
    "this occurs because the double - photon modes running in the @xmath17 or @xmath8 channels always have two photons with orthogonal polarizations .",
    "the half - wave plates will then transform them into @xmath78 or @xmath79 double photons , which are either both reflected or both transmitted at the following pbs , so that the final measurement - filtering stage will not include these cases .",
    "in other words , the polarization hong - ou - mandel effect will make sure that these `` wrong '' channels do not contribute to the final projected state .",
    "another remarkable fact is that in principle the projection step does not require a destructive post - selection if the detectors are able to distinguish between one- and two - photon events , as in this case the detection of the @xmath9 photon is not necessary to determine the success of the process .",
    "the general scheme of the quantum state fission process is given in fig .",
    "1c of the main article . adopting the photon number notation",
    ", we assume to have an input photon encoding two qubits in the four - path state @xmath80 we label this input photon as @xmath8 ( for control ) .",
    "we also label the first two modes as @xmath81 and the last two modes as @xmath82 .",
    "we also have another photon , labeled as @xmath9 ( for target ) , that is initialized in the logical zero state of two other modes , so that the initial two - photon state is the following : @xmath83 we now apply the two cnot gates in sequence , using the @xmath9 photon as target qubit in both cases and the @xmath81 and @xmath82 modes of the @xmath8 photon as control qubit in the first and second cnot , respectively . in order to do these operations properly",
    ", we need to define the cnot operation also for the case when the control qubit is empty . as for the previous case of empty target qubit , the cnot outcome in this case",
    "is taken to be simply identical to the input except for a possible amplitude rescaling , i.e. @xmath84 which is what occurs indeed in most cnot implementations .",
    "our fission scheme works well if the two cnots have the same @xmath47 factor . for brevity",
    "we simply assume @xmath49 in the following , which is the case of the cnot implementations we will utilize .",
    "hence , we obtain @xmath85 now we need to erase part of the information contained in the control photon .",
    "this is accomplished by projecting onto @xmath86 combinations of the first and second pairs of modes , while keeping unaffected their relative amplitudes .",
    "in other words , as shown fig .  1c of the main article , we must apply an hadamard transformation on both pairs of modes , and take as successful outcome only the logical - zero output ( corresponding to the @xmath86 combination of the inputs ) .",
    "the projection is actually performed by checking that no photon comes out of the @xmath87 ( i.e. , logical one ) output ports of the hadamard .",
    "the two surviving output modes are then combined into a single output @xmath8-photon qubit , which together with the @xmath9-photon qubit form the desired split - qubit output .",
    "indeed , we obtain the following projected output : @xmath88 which describes the same two - qubit state as the input , but encoded in two photons instead of one .    the proposed scheme for fission has a 50% probability of success , not considering the cnot contribution",
    ". it might be again possible to bring the probability to 100% ( not considering cnots ) by detecting the actual @xmath8-photon output mode pair after the hadamard gates by a quantum non - demolition approach or in post - selection , and then applying an appropriate unitary transformation to the @xmath9 photon .",
    "alternatively , one can in principle use the klm approach with many ancilla photons and teleportation to turn the scheme into a quasi - deterministic one .",
    "splitted ouput photons exit along mode @xmath9 and either @xmath8 or @xmath89 .",
    "barred squares indicate pbss ; thin rectangles indicate hwps , all oriented at @xmath21 except for the green - colored one which are oriented at @xmath90 so as to be equivalent to a not gate swapping @xmath1 and @xmath2.,width=283 ]    a possible specific apparatus for quantum state fission is shown in fig .",
    "s2 . in this",
    "setup , output photon internal quantum states are defined in the polarization space , as for the fusion setup case .",
    "the four modes of input photon @xmath8 are defined by the two spatial modes @xmath81 and @xmath82 and the two polarizations @xmath1 and @xmath2 . both the target photon @xmath9 and the ancilla photon @xmath17 must enter the setup after being initialized to logical zero , i.e. @xmath1-polarized .    the input three - photon state is the following : @xmath91 the calculations of the optical component effect on this state can be carried out similarly to the case of the fusion setup and we will not repeat them here . we give only the final output obtained after all components and after projection on a subspace in which there is only one photon per output mode ( i.e. , one in @xmath17 , one in @xmath9 , and one in either @xmath8 or @xmath89 ) : @xmath92 this expression shows that again the success probability is of 1/32 without feed - forward .",
    "if we detect the ancilla photon in the @xmath1 polarization and a photon coming out on the @xmath8 channel , then the final state is the desired one : @xmath93 also in this case a feed - forward mechanism can increase the success probability . in particular , if the output ancilla is @xmath2-polarized , then we must change the sign of the @xmath94 mode .",
    "if the control photon comes out from the @xmath89 channel , instead of the @xmath8 channel , then we must swap @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the ancilla detection can be done without disturbing the @xmath8 and @xmath9 output photons , so with a real feed - forward mechanism we can double the success probability .",
    "the control photon detection can only be done destructively ( not considering quantum non - demolition possibilities ) and hence a true feed - forward is not practical ( in principle we could post - pone the measurement of the target photon and correct its polarization state , but in practice this is not useful ) .",
    "once again , however , a klm - like approach based on a large number of ancilla photons can in principle turn this process into a quasi - deterministic one .",
    "the three - photon state used as input in the quantum fusion experiment was conditionally prepared by exploiting the second - order process of a type - ii spontaneous pdc source , generating two photon pairs , with one of the four photons used only as trigger .",
    "a crucial parameter in the four - photon component of the generated state is given by the partial distinguishability of the two generated photon - pairs . in this section we develop a theoretical model for the experiment which takes into account an imperfect indistinguishability between the three photons .",
    "to model the effect of spectral and temporal distinguishability , the generated four - photon density matrix in the two output spatial modes @xmath96 and @xmath97 can be written as follows@xcite : @xmath98 where : @xmath99 here , the parameter @xmath100 is the fraction of events in which two indistinguishable photon pairs are generated in the @xmath101 state .",
    "conversely , @xmath102 is the fraction of events in which two distinguishable photon pairs are emitted by the source ( labeled by the superscript @xmath103 ) .",
    "hence , the parameter @xmath100 represents the degree of indistinguishability of the four - photon state . referring to the experimental scheme of fig .  3 in the main text ,",
    "the output state is analyzed in polarization by selecting the contributions in which two orthogonally - polarized photons are generated on each spatial mode .",
    "the corresponding weights on the states @xmath101 and @xmath104 are respectively @xmath105 and @xmath106 , leading to an overall fraction of events with three indistinguishable photons given by @xmath107 .",
    "let us now proceed with the evolution induced by the quantum fusion apparatus .",
    "without loss of generality , we consider the case in which the photons in the ancillary output modes are projected in the @xmath108 polarization state .",
    "we first observe that due to the polarization analysis of the source , the control and the target qubit always belong to the same photon pair since they are selected with orthogonal polarizations in the two different spatial modes .",
    "when two indistinguishable photon - pairs are produced by the source , the input state in the apparatus takes the form @xmath109 where we have resumed here the shortened notation in which the ket symbols on the left - hand - side are omitted . in this case , with probability @xmath110 , the output photon will emerge only in the desired output state , corresponding to the qubit fusion . when the two pairs emitted by the source are distinguishable , instead , the ancillary photon belongs to a different photon pair with respect to the control and target photons .",
    "the input state in the qubit fusion apparatus can then be written as follows : @xmath111 where the superscripts @xmath112 and @xmath113 distinguish the photons and hence remove the interference effects between the ancilla and the other two photons , thus leading to spurious contributions in the output state and decreasing the fidelity .",
    "the overall input state is then obtained as : @xmath114 the output state can be evaluated by applying to this input the same sequence of operations of the fusion apparatus reported above and finally keeping only the terms corresponding to the detection of two horizontally - polarized photons in the ancilla and control output modes .",

    "<S> we will also need the @xmath30 ket , representing a vacuum state , i.e. the `` empty '' qubit .        </S>",
    "<S> the two photons whose state is to be merged travel in two pairs of modes that we will label as @xmath8 and @xmath9 , with reference to the cnot input qubits . </S>",
    "<S> the initial state of the two photons is taken to be the following ( for simplicity we consider the case of two independent input states , but the results are valid also in the more general entangled case ) : @xmath31 the qubit `` unfolding '' corresponds to adding two empty modes for photon @xmath9 and rearranging the four modes so as to obtain the following state : @xmath32 the first two @xmath9 modes are then treated as one qubit ( @xmath18 ) and the final two @xmath9 modes as a second qubit ( @xmath19 ) , both of them initialized to logical zero , but with the possibility for each of them to be actually empty . </S>",
    "<S> each of these qubits is then subjected to a cnot with the same @xmath8 qubit , and finally the @xmath8 qubit is erased by projection on the @xmath33 state ( this corresponds to applying a hadamard gate and detecting a logical zero ) . </S>",
    "<S> a simple calculation ( see supplementary materials ) shows that this procedure brings the target photon into the desired `` fused '' state @xmath34 since the @xmath8 qubit measurement has a probability of 50% of obtaining @xmath33 , the described method is probabilistic , with a success probability of 50% ( not considering the cnot success probability ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the probability can be raised to 100% by a simple feed - forward procedure , i.e. by applying a suitable unitary transformation on the @xmath9 photon if the @xmath8 measurement yields the orthogonal state @xmath35 .    </S>",
    "<S> one key aspect of the illustrated method is that , after unfolding , each cnot works with a target photon that carries no additional information , so that interference effects are not disrupted . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the cnot gates must work properly also in the case of empty target qubits , in which case the cnot must return an unmodified quantum state ( see supplementary materials for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is a non - trivial requirement , not authomatically guaranteed for all klm approaches , particularly when two cnots are used in series , as in the present case .    </S>",
    "<S> it can be readily seen that the procedure we have described can be also iterated for merging additional qubits to the same photon . for example , in order to add a third qubit , we only need to insert four additional vacuum modes of the target , organized in four pairs so that all components carrying a nonzero amplitude correspond to the logical 0s of the qubits . </S>",
    "<S> next , we need to perform four cnot operations always using as control qubit the new qubit to be merged . finally , we erase the control and leave the eight modes of the target qubit representing the three qubits . </S>",
    "<S> and so on . </S>",
    "<S> the inverse operation of quantum state fission can be also implemented in a very similar way to the fusion , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figconcept]c . </S>",
    "<S> further details about this scheme are given in the supplementary materials .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now consider a specific demonstrative implementation of the fusion scheme using linear optics , in a klm approach @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> cnots can be implemented in linear optics only probabilistically , although in principle the probability can be made as high as desired by introducing an increasing number of ancilla photons . in our implementation , which uses polarization - encoded qubits </S>",
    "<S> , we use the cnot schemes proposed by pittman et al . , </S>",
    "<S> based on half - wave plates ( hwp ) and polarizing beam - splitters ( pbs ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the @xmath8 photon must finally be erased , we can use a single photon ancilla for both gates , and the whole scheme becomes actually symmetrical for the exchange of the two cnots . </S>",
    "<S> the overall fusion scheme , shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figscheme ] , thus requires three photons only , the two to be merged and the ancilla . </S>",
    "<S> its theoretical success probability is 1/32 without feed - forward and 1/8 with feed - forward and it does not rely on post - selection . </S>",
    "<S> the full quantum analysis of this scheme is reported in the supplementary materials .        </S>",
    "<S> the experimental apparatus is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figapparatus ] . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements are based on detecting the fourfold coincidences of the trigger and the output modes @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> for testing the fusion apparatus , we performed quantum fusion of @xmath8 and @xmath9 photons prepared either in the logical - basis polarization states @xmath37 or in their superposition basis states @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results are shown in the upper panels of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figresultsstates ] . for each experimental run , a given state of the two input photons </S>",
    "<S> was prepared and the final four - dimensional state of the output photon was measured , by projection on all four basis states belonging to the expected fusion basis ( see caption of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figresultsstates ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> ideally , we should find nonzero coincidences only when the detected state is the expected `` fused '' one , corresponding to a unitary fidelity . </S>",
    "<S> the measured experimental fidelity , averaged over all tested states , was instead @xmath39)% . </S>",
    "<S> the average measured fidelities for each tested basis are shown in the supplementary materials . </S>",
    "<S> all experimental fidelities , both averaged and individual - state ones , are found to be well above the 40% state - estimation maximal fidelity for a four - dimensional quantum state , showing that our fusion apparatus works much better than a measure - and - prepare trivial approach . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we could explain quantitatively the non - unitary observed fidelities by considering the fact that the pdc process does not actually generate perfectly identical multiple photon pairs . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , there is always a finite degree of indistinguishability of the three photons that affects the final outcome . </S>",
    "<S> we have developed a detailed model of this effect ( see supplementary materials ) , whose predictions are shown in the lower panels of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figresultsstates ] . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement between our model and the experiment is evident . </S>",
    "<S> more quantitatively , we evaluated the similarity @xmath40 between the experimental input / output probability distribution @xmath41 and the predicted one @xmath42 , obtaining @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that this imperfect indistinguishability of the photon pairs is not a fundamental limitation of the fusion process , and in principle we could improve the fidelity by adopting a narrower spatial and spectral filtering of the pdc output , although at the cost of reducing the coincidence rates .    before concluding , </S>",
    "<S> let us now briefly discuss the application prospects of the quantum - state fusion and fission processes we have introduced here . </S>",
    "<S> first , we notice that , although ours has been a bulk - optics demonstration , the fusion / fission processes are expected to find their ideal implementation framework in integrated quantum photonics @xcite . next , as already mentioned , these processes may enable the interfacing of multi - particle protocols of quantum information , in which different qubits are encoded in different photons , with the multi - degree - of - freedom approaches , in which several qubits are encoded in the same particle . this combination in turn , </S>",
    "<S> may have a number of applications , particularly in multi - party quantum communication networks @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , transmitting a cluster of entangled qubits through a high - loss channel , e.g. an earth - satellite link , can be done more efficiently by first fusing the qubits in fewer photons , transmitting them , and then splitting them again after detection . </S>",
    "<S> even if the simplest implementations of fusion / fission are not highly efficient , the overall transmission efficiency can still be boosted by a large factor , as it will scale exponentially in the number of transmitted photons . </S>",
    "<S> another example may be the storing of multiple incoming photonic qubits in a smaller number of multi - level matter registers @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> a possible advantage would be in the overall rate of decoherence of the stored quantum information , that for entangled states will scale with the number of involved registers . </S>",
    "<S> a third example is that of exploiting the multi - degree - of - freedom approach in order to boost the number of qubits that can be processed simultaneously , but without limiting the possibility of interacting with separate parties for the qubit input / output . </S>",
    "<S> we also envision many interesting applications in the study of fundamental issues in quantum physics . </S>",
    "<S> for example , by exploiting the possibility of fusing states that are entangled with external systems one may create and study complex many - particle clusters of entangled states .    </S>",
