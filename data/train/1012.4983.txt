    "@xcite do not cover the short - range phenomena that we have studied here under strong coupling .",
    "the intermediary ( i.e. between weak- and strong - coupling regimes ) values of @xmath391 are studied by using a previously developed grassmann variables formalism @xcite . as a constraining domain for counter - ions , we choose the surface of a cylinder ; this enables us to mimic infinite systems by finite ones containing finite numbers of particles @xmath7 .",
    "we systematically observed that a system with as little as @xmath399 to 10 particles may be considered as `` large '' , in that it is already close to the thermodynamic limit .    the case @xmath8 is solved exactly , for finite as well as infinite @xmath7 .",
    "it shares many features with the pb theory : the particle density decay in @xmath398 does not depend on @xmath16 , the pressure is always repulsive and its large - distance asymptotic is independent of @xmath16 .",
    "the couplings @xmath47 are investigated for finite particle numbers @xmath7 . in the one - line problem ,",
    "the particle density decay is still of the pb type @xmath398 for @xmath9 . for @xmath10",
    ", there are strong indications that the counter - ion density behaves like @xmath400 for large @xmath113 where the exponent @xmath98 is close to 1.5 ( we found @xmath401 ) .",
    "this signals the breaking down of the large - distance pb theory and the dependence of the asymptotic density on @xmath16 .",
    "it has been argued on the contrary that a strongly coupled double - layer behaves , at large distances where counter - ions correlations should be less important , as predicted by a suitably renormalized mean - field approach @xcite .",
    "the data reported here provide evidence , for two dimensional systems , that this is not always the case . the corresponding question for 3d systems that are the main objects of interest in refs @xcite ( i.e. with @xmath402 interactions instead of @xmath403 ) remains open .",
    "as concerns the pressure between equivalently charged lines , it is highly non - trivial even for @xmath48 particles ( see fig . 7 ) .",
    "the monotonous decay at @xmath8 changes for @xmath362 and turns into a profile with an attractive regime , starting from a certain distance . increasing @xmath7 , the results converge quickly for intermediate distances of interest .",
    "we see that the attraction phenomenon is not restricted to the thermodynamic limit , but takes place for small particle numbers and relatively small values of @xmath0 ( 4 and 6 ) .",
    "the finite-@xmath7 analysis of the equation of state enabled us to improve the phase diagram evaluated in the sc regime .",
    "many questions are still open . among interesting perspectives",
    "is the question the effective interaction between arbitrarily shaped objects .",
    "another relevant problem lies in the generalization of the present ideas and methods to system where not only one type of micro - ions is present , such as electrolytes ."
