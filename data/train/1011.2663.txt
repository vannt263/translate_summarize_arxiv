    "half - metallic materials are characterized by a gap in the density of states for minority ( or majority ) electrons at the fermi energy , giving a spin polarization of @xmath0% .",
    "therefore these materials are of great interest for spintronic devices such as magnetic sensors , nonvolatile memories@xcite or programmable logic devices@xcite .",
    "taking jullire s simple model @xcite of the tunnel magnetoresistance , an infinite tmr ratio is expected if two half - metals are used as ferromagnetic electrodes in magnetic tunnel junctions ( mtjs ) .    several half and full heusler compounds",
    "have been predicted to be half metals@xcite and implemented in mtjs .",
    "the largest spin polarizations in al - o based junctions were reported for the full heusler compounds co@xmath1cr@xmath2fe@xmath3al@xcite and co@xmath1yz ( y = mn or fe ; z = si or al)@xcite after tanaka _",
    "et al._@xcite started investigating nimnsb in 1999 .",
    "co@xmath1mnsi electrodes combined with mgo barriers yield even higher tmr ratios@xcite .",
    "however , the highest tmr ratios are currently found in co - fe - b / mgo / co - fe - b junctions@xcite .",
    "ideally , a full heusler compound x@xmath1yz crystallizes in @xmath4 structure whereas a half heusler compound xyz crystallizes in @xmath5 structure .",
    "real heusler compounds often show a certain degree of atomic disorder and thus deviate from the ideal structures .",
    "generally , this has a strong influence on the electronic properties of the films such as the spin polarization .    here , co - mn - sb is implemented as an electrode in magnetic tunnel junctions .",
    "comnsb was thought to be a half heusler compound and the structural , magnetic and electronic properties of bulk comnsb were controversially discussed in the literature .",
    "galanakis@xcite assumed the @xmath5 structure for comnsb and calculated its band structure .",
    "the total spin magnetic moment was almost @xmath6 per formula unit ( f.u . ) , while the mn ( @xmath7 ) and the co ( @xmath8 ) spin moments were antiferromagnetically aligned . presuming a typical lattice constant of 5.9 this corresponds to a low temperature saturation magnetization of 540ka / m .",
    "half metallicity with a large spin - down gap of about 1ev was proposed for this structure .",
    "however , a total magnetic moment of @xmath6 per f.u .",
    "is in contradiction to an experimentally observed value of about @xmath9 per f.u.@xcite . as discussed by tobola _",
    "et al._@xcite this larger moment can be explained by a more complex structure ( space group @xmath10 ) , which was originally proposed by senateur _ et al._@xcite in 1972 .",
    "a narrow spin - down gap is found for this structure , but the half - metallic character is preserved .",
    "the calculated mean mn and co magnetic moments are @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , and are expected to couple ferromagnetically .",
    "kaczmarska _ et al._@xcite could also reproduce a magnetic moment of nearly @xmath9 per f.u .  by their calculations , where a ` disordered ' @xmath4 structure was assumed .",
    "the two x sublattices were occupied by 50% co and 50% vacant sites and the y by mn and z by sb .",
    "the ferromagnetically coupled mn and co magnetic moments were calculated to be @xmath13 and @xmath14 and half - metallicity disappeared .",
    "recently , ksenofontov _",
    "et al._@xcite revised the structure of comnsb bulk samples using xrd , nmr and mssbauer spectroscopy .",
    "they assigned it to space group @xmath15 and presented the comnsb structure as an alternation of co@xmath1mnsb and mnsb structural units with a calculated co moment of @xmath16 and a mean mn moment of @xmath17 . taking the experimental lattice parameter of 11.73 into account",
    "this corresponds to a magnetization of 740ka / m .",
    "comnsb crystallized in this structure is predicted to be not half - metallic .    in this paper , we present investigations of co - mn - sb thin films of different compositions implemented in mtjs with al - o barrier and co - fe counter electrode . in sec .",
    "[ seciii ] we analyze the bulk properties of the films , namely magnetization , interdiffusion with the buffer , element specific magnetic moments and crystal structure .",
    "optimized growth conditions of the films were obtained with respect to these quantities . in sec .",
    "[ seciv ] we discuss the properties of the co - mn - sb / al - o interface and the tunnel properties of the corresponding magnetic tunnel junctions .",
    "the samples were deposited at room temperature by dc - magnetron sputtering in a sputter tool with a base pressure of @xmath18 mbar . thermally oxidized si(100 ) wafers and 200 nm thick si@xmath19n@xmath20 membranes with a window size of 3 mm @xmath21 3 mm were used as substrates .",
    "first , a vanadium buffer was deposited , then , the co - mn - sb films were prepared from three different targets .",
    ".nominal target and the resulting film compositions .",
    "film ii was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy ( icp - oes ) and energy dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( edx ) .",
    "identically prepared films from targets i and iii were investigated by edx and corrected using the icp - oes values of film ii .",
    "the observed edge jump heights in the x - ray absorption spectra of co and mn agree with these concentrations . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the shape of the mn xmcd asymmetry is nearly the same for all samples and very similar to mn in the full heusler compound co@xmath1mnsi@xcite .",
    "accordingly , the mn orbital to spin moment ratio does not depend on layer composition or post - annealing .",
    "the small mn orbital moments are typically -6% of the spin moments , i.e. both are aligned anti - parallel .",
    "furthermore , the mn magnetic moment of sample half  a@xmath22 was found to be reduced by @xmath23 between 15k and rt , which is in fair agreement with the data by otto _",
    "et al._@xcite , who observed a reduction of the saturation magnetization for bulk samples of @xmath24 between @xmath25k and rt and a curie temperature of 478k .",
    "the co spin moment is aligned in parallel to its small orbital moment and the target composition and the post - annealing has a significant influence on the co to mn spin magnetic moments ratio which can be directly seen from the different sizes of the normalized co xmcd signals in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] b. two clear trends are observed : first , the normalized co xmcd signal and , therefore , the relative contribution of each co atom to the total magnetic moment of the samples is reduced by annealing for all samples of type half  a. second , the relative contribution of the co magnetic moments to the total magnetic moment of the samples increases with increasing co concentration in the films .",
    "the smallest spin magnetic moment ratio @xmath26 of 18.8% is found for the annealed sample deposited from target i while the largest one ( 45.5% ) is found for the as prepared sample deposited from target iii ( see tab .",
    "[ tab:3 ] ) .",
    "similar results were found for annealed co - mn - sb films grown on cu / ta / v buffers and are published elsewhere@xcite .",
    "moreover , there is a remarkable double peak structure of the co xmcd spectra at the @xmath27 and @xmath28 edge , which is significantly different from co metal@xcite or co@xmath1mnsi@xcite and leads to a strongly changed electronic structure of the unoccupied @xmath29 co states compared to the references .",
    "this structure changes with different film composition and post - annealing .",
    "in addition to the decrease of the co to mn spin moment ratio , which corresponds to generally reduced intensities of the peaks `` a '' and `` b '' ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3]c ) , the intensity of peak `` a '' is reduced further in comparison to `` b '' with decreasing co concentration and by annealing .",
    "the same holds for the corresponding peaks `` c '' and `` d '' at the @xmath27 edge . the changed shape of the co xmcd spectra could be caused by a different degree of location of the 3d states@xcite or hint to two non - equivalent co positions in the co - mn - sb crystal lattice .",
    "this is in accordance with the structural model of alternating co@xmath1mnsb and mnsb structural units as discussed below .",
    "moreover , because of the strong influence of the co concentration on the spectral shape it is likely to assume , that the additional co occupies the vacancy sites in the mnsb structural units .    the generally observed ferromagnetic coupling of the mn and co spin moment is important with respect to the different crystal structures discussed in the literature ( see sec . [ intro ] ) . in the case of a c1@xmath30 lattice",
    "an anti - ferromagnetic coupling of co and mn spin moments is expected ( @xmath31 ) . for the more complex structures resulting in a very narrow or even vanishing spin - down gap ,",
    "both moments are expected to be ferromagnetically coupled ( senateur s model : @xmath32@xcite ; disordered @xmath4 structure : @xmath33@xcite ; alternation of co@xmath1mnsb and mnsb structural units : @xmath34@xcite ) .",
    "further , for comnsb crystallized in the c1@xmath30 structure a parallel alignment of the spin and orbital moments is expected@xcite .",
    "obviously , our experimental data for the annealed half a@xmath22 sample fits best together with the structural model proposed by ksenofontov _",
    "et al._@xcite .    by comparing the element - specific results and the bulk magnetization discussed in sec .",
    "[ subseca ] one can conclude that the general increase of the magnetization with increasing co content ( see fig . [ fig:1 ] ) results from the larger co content _ and _ the larger contribution of each co atom to the total magnetic moment .",
    "the general reduction of @xmath26 after annealing and the simultaneous increase of the bulk magnetization means , that the atomic order is improved by the post - annealing process : the magnetization of comnsb crystallized in one of the three complex structures suggested by tobola _",
    "et al._@xcite , kaczmarska _",
    "et al._@xcite and ksenofontov _ et al._@xcite , respectively , is dominated by the mn spin moment , which is aligned in parallel to the co spin moment .",
    "thereby , the co magnetic moment is considerably smaller in these compounds compared to pure co metal ( @xmath35@xcite ) , where nearest - neighbor co atoms couple ferromagnetically . from this",
    "one would expect an increase of the mean co magnetic moment per atom in case of atomic disorder , e.g. , when co atoms occupy mn lattice sites . on the other hand ,",
    "nearest - neighbor mn atoms tend to couple antiferromagnetically , accordingly a decrease of the mean mn magnetic moment would be expected for a disordered compound .",
    "this behavior has been predicted by picozzi _",
    "et al . _ for defects in @xmath4 ordered co@xmath1mnsi@xcite .",
    "accordingly , the results can be explained as an improvement of the atomic order by the post - annealing process .",
    "a similar behavior has been observed for full heusler compound thin films and multilayers like co@xmath1mnsi@xcite , co@xmath1fesi and @xmath36co@xmath1mnsi / co@xmath1fesi@xmath37@xcite .",
    "a phillips xpert pro mpd diffractometer equipped with an open eulerian cradle and a copper anode was used for non - specular x - ray diffraction .",
    "figure [ fig : xrd - angles ] displays the scattering geometry and the angle definitions .",
    "crystallinity and atomic order of co - mn - sb was studied and related to the magnetic and electronic properties .",
    "rocking curves and pole figures were taken to characterize the texture of the v buffer and the co - mn - sb .",
    "both materials grow ( 110 ) textured .",
    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the co - mn - sb ( 440)/(220 ) rocking curves is 8@xmath38 for sample half  b@xmath39 and 10@xmath38 for sample half  b@xmath40 .    in textured samples ,",
    "only one group of diffraction peaks is accessible with @xmath41-@xmath42 scans .",
    "one can find that the ( 220 ) peak intensity of heusler compounds is independent of site - swap disorder@xcite by an analysis of the structure factors of a c1@xmath30 ( half ) or l2@xmath43 ( full-)heusler compound .",
    "in contrast , the ( 200 ) and ( 111 ) peak intensities depend on disorder and will vanish for a1 type disorder , where the lattice sites are randomly occupied .",
    "therefore a ( 110)-textured l2@xmath43 film will give the same specular diffractogram as a ( 110)-textured a1-disordered film of the same compound .",
    "furthermore , this is also true for the various crystal structures which have been proposed for comnsb ( see sec .",
    "[ intro ] ) .",

    "the scan with @xmath49 shows the v ( 110 ) reflex and the strong ( 440 ) reflex from the co - mn - sb . at higher values of @xmath47",
    "more reflections appear .",
    "a well - ordered c1@xmath30 lattice would exhibit the ( 222 ) , ( 400 ) and ( 440 ) reflections only ( which would be indexed ( 111 ) , ( 200 ) and ( 220 ) then ) .",
    "the additional ( 311 ) , ( 331 ) , ( 333)/(511 ) and ( 531 ) peaks have comparatively low intensity and grow with increasing annealing temperature .",
    "similar patterns were found by ksenofontov _",
    "et al._@xcite in powders of co - mn - sb .",
    "the peaks can not be indexed based on a l2@xmath43/c1@xmath30 structure with a lattice constant of about 5.9 .",
    "in contrast , they can be indexed by the assumption of a doubled unit cell parameter of 11.77 .",
    "analogous measurements on sample half  b@xmath40 did not show the additional peaks .",
    "the complex unit cell with a doubled lattice constant is obviously specific for the nearly stoichiometric comnsb .",
    "the co excess in films sputtered from target iii might lead to occupation of the vacant sites in the mnsb substructure of the co@xmath1mnsb - mnsb super cells .",

    "the lattice parameters shrink with increasing annealing temperature , indicating a lattice relaxation and/or ordering .",
    "after 400@xmath44c the lattice parameters in the three probed directions are the same , stress - induced influences might be compensated .    the integrated intensity of the ( 222 ) and ( 400 ) reflexes is a measure for the order in the films .",
    "figure [ fig : peakanalysis ] ( right ) shows a plot of the normalized integrated ( 222 ) and ( 400 ) peak intensities as a function of the annealing temperature .",
    "the normalization is done with respect to the integrated ( 440 ) intensity to correct for recrystallization .",
    "the ( 222 ) intensity increases by a factor of 4 from the as - prepared sample to 450@xmath44c .",
    "note that the intensity of the ( 222 ) reflex is further increased with annealing from 400@xmath44c to 450@xmath44c , whereas the ( 400 ) reflex intensity does not increase monotonously , but rather shows a dip at @xmath53=400@xmath44c .",
    "the additional peaks of the comnsb superstructure vanish for annealing at @xmath53=450@xmath44c .",
    "vanadium is implemented into the lattice and thus decreases the saturation magnetization ( section [ subseca ] ) .",

    "concentration ratio was found at the interface with decreasing al thickness ( see @xmath57 in fig . [ fig:5x]c ) .",
    "this trend becomes more pronounced after annealing .",
    "the shapes of the mn xa spectra in figure [ fig:5y ] show that this mn segregation at the co - mn - sb / al - o interface is caused by mno formation at the lower barrier interface . for an al thickness of only 1.0 nm the spectra of the as prepared as well as the annealed samples were dominated by the multiplet structure typical for mno@xcite .",
    "the multiplet structure became weaker with increasing al thickness .",
    "a structureless @xmath59 absorption edge was found for thick aluminum , its shape is similar to metallic bulk mn@xcite .    the significant formation of interfacial mno ( paramagnetic at room temperature@xcite ) for 1.0 nm thick al is also reflected in the low xmcd asymmetry ratio @xmath58 .",
    "this is proportional to the ratio of the mn and co magnetic moments , which are both dominated by the spin moment ( see above ) .",
    "@xmath58 was maximal after annealing for an al thickness of 1.6 nm and the contribution of mno to the xa spectrum is already very small compared to 1.0 nm al ( see figure [ fig:5y]b ) . here ,",

    "[ subsecc ] ) .",
    "while thin al leads to an oxidation of the ferromagnetic electrode , metallic al will remain at the interface , if the al thickness is too large .",
    "this al can diffuse into the co - mn - sb electrode during annealing leading to a reduction of the interfacial magnetic moments and the mn to co magnetic moment ratio .",

    "[ subsecc ] was not found at the co - mn - sb / al - o interface for 2.7 nm thick al due to residual unoxidized al .",
    "however , such an increase was found for optimum aluminum thickness of 1.6 nm . at this al thickness , the properties of the co - mn - sb near the surface are closest to those of the bulk material .      the magnetic tunnel junctions full@xmath54 were prepared with optimized growth conditions as discussed earlier : they were _ in - situ _ annealed at 350@xmath44c after 150s plasma - oxidation of the al wedge .",
    "in order to remove contaminations from the surface , the samples were plasma oxidized for another 50s after the annealing .",
    "subsequently , _ ex - situ _ vacuum annealing at 275@xmath44c in a magnetic field of 0.1 t was employed to set the exchange bias of the pinned electrode . in previous papers@xcite",
    "we show that this preparation scheme is suitable to produce magnetic tunnel junctions with heusler compound electrodes that exhibit high tmr ratios .",
    "patterning was done by optical lithography and ion beam etching , the transport properties of the quadratic 100 @xmath21 100 @xmath60m@xmath61 wide mtjs were measured by conventional two - probe method with a constant dc bias voltage .    .",
    "the measurements were taken with a dc bias voltage of 10mv.,width=302 ]    in figure [ fig : wedge ] the dependence of the tmr on the al thickness is shown . a maximal tmr ratio of 8.5% at room temperature was found at an al thickness of 1.25 nm ( 1.6 nm alox ) .",
    "the al thickness dependence of @xmath58 presented in the last section fits quite well to the al thickness dependence of the tmr .",
    "the observed maximum tmr ratio at 13k was 24% ( see inset in figure [ fig : wedge ] ) . according to the jullire model",
    ", the effective tunneling spin polarization is calculated to be 0.22 , using a spin polarization for co@xmath62fe@xmath63 of 0.5 @xcite .",
    "no higher values for the tmr ratio could be found with varied film growth parameters .",
    "moreover , mtjs with co - mn - sb electrodes from targets i and iii show comparable tmr ratios . taking this together with the careful preparation of the films and the tunnel barrier ,",
    "we conclude that the low observed spin polarization is an intrinsic property of our co - mn - sb electrodes .",
    "it was shown that post annealing increases the atomic order and the magnetization of the co - mn - sb films , while the co to mn magnetic moment ratio decreased .",
    "the samples degraded for temperatures higher than 350@xmath44c because of inter - diffusion of v at the co - mn - sb / v interface .",
    "adding co to the samples leads to higher magnetization values and to a larger co to mn magnetic moment ratio as expected from simple arguments basing on the typical nearest - neighbor coupling behavior of co - co and mn - mn pairs .",
    "a parallel coupling of the co and mn magnetic spin moments was found for all compositions . for nearly stoichiometric films the co to mn spin moment ratio was + 18.8% after annealing and the unit cell parameter was 11.77 .",
