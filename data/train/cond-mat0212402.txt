    "the reasons why sexual reproduction appeared , hundreds of million years ago , are still under investigation today @xcite .",
    "one of the reasons commonly used to justify sex is the higher genetic diversity it produces if compared to asexual reproduction . on the other hand ,",
    "sex is closely related to aging : all sexual species present aging , which starts as soon as reproduction starts @xcite .",
    "because of its ability to address both questions in a single context , the penna model for biological aging @xcite has been extensively used in recent years to study why sex evolved ( for a review see @xcite ) .    s martins and moss de oliveira , for instance , have shown that the higher diversity of sexual populations can prevent extinction if a catastrophe damaging the genome of the individuals ( such as exposure to radiation ) occurs @xcite .",
    "diversity was also the key issue discussed by s martins @xcite in his simulation of the competition of sexual and asexual varieties of a single species , coevolving under the assault of parasitic infestation .",
    "the density of parasites was shown to drive a transition between asexual and sexual orders , in agreement with the so - called red queen hypothesis for the evolution of sex @xcite ) .",
    "the above mentioned results show that the model provides sexual varieties with survival advantages , due to their larger genetic diversity , over the asexual ones , whenever they compete in a changing environment .",
    "nevertheless , in the absence of competition and a mutant environment , the asexual populations resulting from simulations of the standard penna model are always much larger , since they generate twice as many offspring for the same population size .",
    "this effect is not overcome by the need , in diploid individuals , for homozygose if the harmful allele is to become active in loci for which it is not dominant . without catastrophes or parasites ,",
    "if a sexual and an asexual population are allowed to evolve under the same immutable environment , competing for the same food resources , the asexual one will win and the sexual one disappears ( due to the verhulst logistic factor explained in section two ) . only very recently has a new ingredient been introduced @xcite into the penna model allowing larger sexual populations to be obtained , with sizes comparable to the asexual ones .",
    "we now use this modified penna model to address a tantalizing issue : since a diploid sexual population has the upper hand when competing against an asexual one due do the diversity generated by the use of genetic material coming from two different parents , why does not nature enhance this effect by allowing the genome of the offspring to benefit from three different templates ? is the need for homozygose mentioned above enough to overcome the burden of using three individuals to generate one offspring ? to provide answers to these questions , we compare two different kinds of sexual populations : one involving the mating of two diploid individuals as parents ( normal sexual reproduction ) and the other involving three triploid individuals .",
    "the paper has the following structure : in section 2 we describe the model , first for diploids and then for triploids , in section 3 we present our results and in section 4 , our conclusions .",
    "each individual of the population is represented by a `` chronological genome '' , which consists of two bit - strings of 32 bits ( 32 loci or positions ) each , that are read in parallel .",
    "one string contains the genetic information inherited from the mother and the other , from the father .",
    "each position of the bit - strings is associated to a period of the individual s life , which means that each individual can live at most for 32 periods ( `` years '' ) .",
    "each step of the simulation corresponds to reading one new position of all individuals genomes .",
    "diseases are represented by bits 1 .",
    "if an individual has two bits 1 in the @xmath0-th position of both bit - strings ( homozygote ) , it will start to suffer the effects of a disease at his @xmath0-th year of life .",
    "if the individual is homozygous with two bits zero , no disease appears in that age .",
    "if the individual is heterozygous in that position , he will become sick only if that locus is one for which the harmful allele is dominant .",
    "the dominant loci are randomly chosen at the beginning of the simulation and remain fixed . if the actual number of accumulated diseases reaches a threshold @xmath1 , the individual dies .    in order to avoid an exponential increase of the population and to introduce a dispute for food and space ,",
    "a logistic verhulst factor is used .",
    "every time step and for each individual , a random number between zero and one is generated .",
    "this number is compared with @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the actual size of the population and @xmath4 is the carrying capacity . if the random number is smaller than @xmath5 , the individual dies , independent of its age or genome . for a discussion of other alternatives of implementation of this mean - field - like interaction between individuals of the population",
    "we direct the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite .    if a female succeeds in surviving until the minimum reproduction age @xmath6 , it generates @xmath7 offspring every period until death .",
    "the female chooses randomly a male to mate , with age also greater than or equal to @xmath6 .",
    "the offspring genome is constructed from the parents ones ; first , the strings of the mother are cut in two at a randomly chosen position ( `` crossing '' ) and two complementary pieces , one from each string , are recombined to generate the female gamete ( one string of 32 bits ) . @xmath8",
    "deleterious mutations are then randomly introduced .",
    "the same process occurs with the father s genome and the union of the two resulting gametes forms the new genome .",
    "the sex of the baby is randomly chosen , with equal probability .",
    "deleterious mutation means that if a bit 0 is randomly chosen in the parent s genome , it is set to 1 in the offspring genome . however ,",
    "if a bit already set to 1 is randomly chosen , it remains 1 in the offspring genome ( no back mutations ) .",
    "the description given above corresponds to the original sexual version of the penna model @xcite .",
    "the new ingredient , mentioned in section 1 and introduced by s martins and stauffer @xcite , consists in assuming that harmful mutation reduces the survival probability .",
    "thus , at each iteration , or `` year , '' each individual survives with probability @xmath9 if it has a total of @xmath10 harmful mutations ( taking into account dominant positions ) in it s full genome ( it is killed if a random number is tossed that is smaller than the survival probability ) .",
    "@xmath11 is a parameter of the simulation , fixed from the start . to summarize ,",
    "an individual may now die for any one of three reasons : i ) randomly , due to the verhulst logistic factor ; ii ) if its actual number of accumulated diseases reaches the limit @xmath1 ; iii ) due to its survival probability being too small .      in this case , we assume that mating involves three triploid individuals ( two males and one female or vice - versa ) .",
    "the chronological genomes consist of three bit - strings that are read in parallel .",
    "homozygous positions are those with three equal bits at homologous loci .",
    "harmful mutations are active only if there are three bits 1 at that same position , or at a heterozygous locus at which harmful mutations are dominant .",
    "only females generate offspring .",
    "there are random crossing and recombination to produce the offspring genome ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , and deleterious mutations are randomly introduced in each of the three gametes .",
    "the baby is a male or a female , with equal probability .    the first question we want to investigate relates to the competition between the benefit provided by a triploid genome and the effort involved in a mating that needs three individuals , instead of two , to generate the offspring .",
    "the benefit is the fact that , for triploids , mutations that happen in loci where the harmful allele is not dominant need to appear in all three bit - strings to become active .",
    "the curves presented below correspond to the average of the results obtained for 20 different populations ( 20 different initial seeds for the random number generator ) , using the following parameters :    initial population = 10,000 ;    maximum population size @xmath12 individuals ;    maximum number of genetic diseases @xmath13 ;    minimum reproduction age @xmath14 ;    birth rate @xmath15 ;    mutation rate @xmath16 per bit - string ( or gamete ) ;    number of dominant positions @xmath17 ;    decrease in survival probability @xmath18 ;    total number of monte carlo steps = 800,000 ;    in figure 2 we present the time evolution of a diploid population ( upper curve ) and of two triploid populations , one for which reproduction involves the mating of one male and two females ( central curve ) and the other corresponding to the mating of two males and one female ( lower curve ) . in figure 3 we present the corresponding dimensionless survival rates @xmath19 as a function of age @xmath20 , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the number of individuals with age @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the number of individuals with age @xmath20 .    from these figures",
    "we can see that the diploid population is not only larger than the other two , but also presents a higher survival probability",
    ". however , it may be not enough to guarantee that the diploid population is better than the triploid ones .",
    "a second important measure , as mentioned in the introduction , is the genetic diversity of the populations .",
    "it has already been shown that the survival probability of a sexual population is the same as that of a diploid asexual population that reproduces by meiotic parthenogenesis .",
    "however , the larger genetic diversity of the sexual population may prevent it from extinction if , for example , exposure to radiation occurs [ 5 ] .",
    "the genetic diversity is calculated by measuring the hamming distance , in this case defined by the number of different loci ( bits ) between the genomes , for all pairs of individuals .",
    "the probability distribution of these distances is obtained by making a histogram of the fraction of pairs , out of all possible pairs in the population , that present a given hamming distance , normalized by its maximum possible value ( 64 for diploids and 96 for triploids ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the resulting distributions for the diploid and triploid populations .",
    "it is clear that the diploid population presents both a larger mean distance between pairs , indicated roughly by the position of the peak of the distribution , and a larger variance , measured by the width at half the maximum height of the curves .",
    "this assures a larger diversity within its genome space for the diploid populations , and will give them the upper hand when competing against the triploids under the pressure of a rapidly mutating environment .",
    "it is worth while mentioning that the results are essentially the same if we allow a double crossing of the triploid genome during reproduction , and there is no benefit for the triploids to ensure that the offspring have their genetic material gathered from all three parents .",
    "we generalized the sexual version of the penna model for biological aging to simulate also triploid populations . in these populations individuals",
    "present three sets of homologous chromosomes .",
    "a harmful mutation needs to appear in all of them to become active or to be in a locus where the harmful allele is dominant .",
    "we showed that normal diploid sexual populations have higher survival rates and are larger than the triploid ones , for the same carrying capacity of the environment .",
    "the genetic diversities of the populations , measured by the hamming distance distribution , were also compared .",
    "the result shows that the diploid population presents a higher genetic diversity than the triploid ones .",
    "we may thus conclude that , concerning survival probabilities , population sizes and diversity , usual sex is better than that involving three individuals .",
    "sexual diploid populations would be favored in direct competition with triploids either in a stable or a mutating environment , and we claim that this is the reason for normal sex to have been chosen by evolution as the dominant reproduction strategy .",
    "these results mean that the fact that triploids need mutations to appear in all three sets of homologous cromossomes to become effective is not enough to overcome the effort of a mating involving three individuals , and that more is not necessarily better insofar as genetic diversity is concerned .      99 s. dasgupta , physica a 298 ( 2001 ) 465 . l. partridge and n.h .",
