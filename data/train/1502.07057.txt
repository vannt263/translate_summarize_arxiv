    "the ulx m82 x-1 , with x - ray luminosities of @xmath3 and quasi - periodical oscillation ( qpo ) behavior , is one of the most promising intermediate mass black hole ( imbh ) candidates in the local universe @xcite .",
    "the discovery of x - ray spectral state transition in m82 x-1 shows it has x - ray luminosities of @xmath4 at the thermal - dominant state , suggesting an imbh with mass @xmath5 to @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the discovery of the 60 - 120 milli - hz qpos @xcite suggests the strong x - ray emission originates from the accretion disk instead of a jet , and suggests an imbh of @xmath7 if these low - frequency qpos corresponds to the keplerian frequency of the innermost stable orbit .",
    "pasham et al .",
    "( 2014 ) re - analyzed 6-year rxte x - ray observations and revealed the high - frequency , 3:2 ratio - ed , twin - peak qpos of 3.3hz and 5hz , which , in combination with the low - frequency qpo revealed by an xmm - newton observation , suggests an imbh of @xmath8 under the relativistic precession model ( motta et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "many efforts have been made to search for the radio counterpart of m82 x-1 , and two radio sources were discovered at the vicinity of this ulx .",
    "a stable radio source @xmath9 away from m82 x-1 is proposed to be a supernova remnant ( snr ) and not related to m82 x-1 @xcite .",
    "the other radio source was detected ( at r.a.=9:55:50.19 , dec=+69:40:46.0 ) throughout the 7-hr 1981 vla observation at a 9mjy flux level @xcite , but later was not detected in the 2003 vla observations @xcite or the 2005 vla observations @xcite .",
    "@xcite re - examined the 1981 vla data and found a @xmath10 offset between the flare source and m82 x-1 .",
    "given the chandra positional uncertainty of @xmath11 , it is not clear whether it is really associated with m82 x-1 and suggesting relativistic beaming effects as causing the high x - ray luminosities",
    ". a careful work on astrometry is required to achieve a better understanding of m82 x-1 .    in this paper",
    ", we re - analyze the _",
    "acis observations with the sub - pixel technique to obtain improved spatial resolution and centroid accuracy .",
    "we describe data analysis and results in   2 and discuss the implications of our work in   3 .",
    "m82 x-1 has been observed 22 times by _ acis _ onboard _ chandra _ between 1999 and 2014 , with off - axis angles from below @xmath12 to above @xmath13 .",
    "the obs ids are : 361 , 378 , 379 , 380 , 1302 , 2933 , 5644 , 6097 , 6361 , 8190 , 10025 , 10026 , 10027 , 10542 , 10543 , 10544 , 10545 , 10925 , 11104 , 11800 , 13796 and 15616 . in this work",
    "we focus on obs i d 10543 ( pi : strickland ) , which had the longest exposure of 120 ks with m82 x-1 placed only @xmath14 from the aiming point .",
    "the energy range used in this paper is 0.3 - 8 kev unless stated otherwise .",
    "a careful examination of the chandra image shows that the image size of m82 x-1 is larger than other nearby sources ( e.g. , j095551.2 , see fig  [ fig:01 ] ) , motivating our further analysis .",
    "we reprocess the level 1 event files using the _ chandra_repro _ command in _ chandra _ interactive analysis of observations ( _ ciao_,version 4.5 ) software . following the standard pipeline ,",
    "we remove time intervals with significant flares , as well as bad columns / pixels and events of bad grades , to produce the level 2 event files .",

    "acis _ 0.3 - 8 kev image centered around m82 x-1 after reprocessing .",
    "clearly , m82 x-1 is split into two fuzzy but discrete sources , while other nearby ulxs are not .",
    "applying wavdetect to the image results in an detection of two sources , as presented in table  [ tbl-01 ] and fig  [ fig:01 ] .",
    "the brighter one is m82 x-1 itself , and its position ( ra=9:55:50.123 , dec=+69:40:46.54 ) is consistent with previously detected positions ( e.g. , griffiths et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the second source ( hereafter s1 ) , with ra=9:55:50.245 and dec=+69:40:45.67 , is located @xmath15 to the lower - left of m82 x-1 .",
    "not detected by wavdetect is extra photon concentration to the lower right of x-1 , which is probably caused by the psf feature like other nearby ulxs ( e.g. , see j095551.2 in fig  [ fig:01 ] ) . in obsid 10543",
    ", m82 x-1 suffers from severe pile - up effects ( see  2.2 ) , which may affect its centroid . in comparison ,",
    "the _ hrc _ observations do not suffer from pile - up effects and are expected to give accurate centroid positions for m82 x-1 and other sources .",
    "we have analyzed the _",
    "hrc _ observations and listed the centroid positions for matched sources between the acis and hrc ( obs i d 8189 ) observations .",
    "as shown in table  [ tbl-02 ] , similar displacement of @xmath16  exists between the acis and hrc observations for all matched pairs , including x-1 despite the pile - up effects .    as _ chandra _ s psf could be strongly distorted and cause fake detection in @xmath17 direction ( _ chandra _ instrument layout directions are used in this paper for convenience ) , we need to ascertain whether they are real sources or just psf artifacts .",
    "the relative position of s1 strongly suggested s1 is a real source .",
    "the relative position of s1 to m82 x-1 in ccd is @xmath18 , which is different from the possible spurious source region ( fig  [ fig:01 ] , the cyan region centered at 15@xmath19 counter clockwise to @xmath17 ) or the readout streak region ( fig  [ fig:01 ] ) .",
    "moreover , the distance from x-1 to s1 is @xmath201.1 , greater than the psf distortion region(@xmath200.8 ) , making it unlikely to be a psf artifact . indeed , none of other nearby bright sources show photon concentration in @xmath18 direction like s1 , again supporting that s1 is a real source .      the spectra and the respective _ rmf _ and _ arf _ files of m82 x-1 and s1 are extracted using command in _ ciao _ with 0.7  circular source regions ( fig  [ fig:01 ] ) .",
    "the background region for x-1 is a rectangular region , and that for s1 is an annulus centered at s1 , with inner radius 0.8  and outer radius 1.4 .",
    "the x-1 region is excluded when extracting spectrum for s1 , and vice versa .",
    "the respective count rates are roughly 0.029 c / s and 0.016 c / s in 0.3 - 8 kev band for x-1 and s1 .",
    "the 0.7  extraction radius of s1 may miss certain amount of hard photons outside , thus lead to a biased spectrum . yet",
    "our results are qualitatively valid due to the following reasons : i ) the 0.7  radius is comparable to the local @xmath2085% energy encircled radius as suggested by the psf file , so the number of leaked hard photons is limited ; ii ) further correction on the spectrum will include more hard photons and thus a harder spectrum .",
    "the spectra are then loaded to xspec and analyzed .",
    "we do not tend to focus on the spectra investigation , so an absorbed power law ( pha*powerlaw ) model is used as a characterization .",
    "as shown in table  [ tbl-01 ] , the spectrum of m82 x-1 has @xmath21 , even harder than the one reported by @xcite .",
    "such a hard spectrum is unphysical and likely caused by heavy pile - up effects , as indicated by the strong read - out streak .",
    "because the readout streak contains photons of m82 x-1 before pile - up , its spectrum ( with a 0.3 - 8 kev count rate of 0.009 c / s ) is analyzed as a proxy for m82 x-1 .",
    "the spectrum of the readout streak can be well fitted with an absorbed power law with @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "the streak exposure time correction is found to be @xmath24 , suggesting that the true count rate of m82 x-1 is 2.1 c / s , and its un - absorbed luminosity is @xmath25 .",
    "the spectrum of s1 has @xmath26@xmath27 and @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "placed at the distance of m82 , s1 would have an un - absorbed luminosity of @xmath30 , @xmath20 1% of that of m82 x-1 .",
    "however , due to the severe pile - up of m82 x-1 , the 0.3 - 8 kev count rate of s1 is almost half of m82 x-1 s count rate , enough to cause a significant positional displacement of m82 x-1 .    to test the spectral difference for subregions of the psf",
    ", we have extracted the spectra from two subregions of the nearby bright source j095551.2 in parallel to x-1 and s1 of m82 x-1 ( see fig  [ fig:01 ] ) .",
    "as expected , these spectra are similar to each other with @xmath31 .",
    "as shown above , s1 s spectrum is consistent with those in the low - hard states of black hole x - ray binaries ( remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) and is intrinsically different from that of m82 x-1 or its readout streak at the 90% confidence level , again supporting that s1 is a real source .",
    "we further analyze other _ chandra acis _",
    "observations in a similar way as in obs i d 10543 .",
    "s1 is not detected in any other _ acis _ observations , including the three observations 10542 , 10925 and 10544 , observed about a week before and after obs i d 10543 , respectively . using the same 0.7@xmath1 extraction region and the same annular background region ,",
    "we extract counts at s1 s position for all other _ acis _ observations . in obs ids 378 , 379 , 380 , 6097 , 8190 , 10025 , 10026 , 10027 and 10545",
    ", s1 was fully buried in the psf wings of x-1 , so extraction results from these observations are excluded . in other observations ,",
    "the psf wing of m82 x-1 still partly cover s1 regions , and these obvious x-1 psf wing regions are excluded . after this process",
    ", it is still possible that some photons in the extraction regions could come from x-1 , thus the estimated count rates of s1 should be treated as upper limits . in fig  [ fig:02 ]",
    "we present the results .",
    "the 0.3 - 8 kev count rate of s1 was @xmath32 0.001 c / s in 1999 ( obs i d 361 ) and was @xmath32 0.007 c / s in 2009 ( obs i d 10542 ) , then rose to @xmath20 0.016 c / s within a week ( obs i d 10543 ) and dropped to @xmath320.0007 c / s with 7 days ( obs i d 10544 ) .",
    "judged from the light curve , s1 is likely a transient source in 0.3 - 8 kev band .",
    "this transient behavior , as well as the fact that s1 was usually in the shadow of m82 x-1 s psf is likely the reason why s1 was only detected once in 22 chandra observations .",
    "it is now possible to identify the radio flare source given the centroids of m82 x-1 and s1 . using three bright acis point sources ( @xmath33 ; see table  [ tbl-02 ] for details ) with optical matches from the sloan digital sky survey(sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we find a @xmath34 displacement between the acis coordinate frame and the sdss coordinate frame ( the same as the vlbi coordinate frame with an error of @xmath35 ) .",
    "the position of the radio flare source is corrected accordingly and registered to the acis image ( fig  [ fig:01 ] ) .",
    "the flare source is now @xmath36 away from m82 x-1 , but only @xmath37 away from s1 . clearly , the position of m82 x-1 is no longer consistent with that of the radio flare source . on the other hand",
    ", s1 s position is consistent with the radio flare source within the positional uncertainty ( @xmath34 ; mainly from the astrometric correction ) .",
    "if the radio flare is indeed associated with s1 , it can be the radio outburst from a black hole x - ray binary when the binary transits from hard to soft states ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xcite discovered strong radio emission at a flux level @xmath38mjy from a micro - quasar in m31 during its x - ray outburst at an x - ray luminosity of @xmath39 .",
    "the properties of s1 are consistent with those of the m31 micro - quasar , and it can well be a similar micro - quasar , albeit with higher radio flux ( 9mjy ) .",
    "however , unlike in the case of the m31 micro - quasar , the radio flare and the x - ray outburst for s1 were not detected simultaneously , and further simultaneous monitoring observations in radio and x - ray are needed to determine its exact nature .",
    "m82 x-1 , one of the most promising imbh candidates in the local universe , is possibly associated with a radio flare source , suggestive of relativistic beaming effects for its extremely high x - ray luminosities .",
    "we have applied the sub - pixeling technique to the longest chandra observation of m82 x-1 , and split it into two separate discrete sources , namely x-1 itself and s1 .",
    "both relative positions and spectral properties show that s1 is a real source and not a psf artifact , although it was detected only once out of 22 chandra observations .",
    "careful astrometric work shows that the radio flare source is associated with the transient s1 .",
    "m82 x-1 is no longer associated with the radio flare , eliminating the necessity for relativistic beaming .",
    "the radio flare and x - ray outburst of s1 are analogous to those of a recently discovered micro - quasar in m31 ( middleton et al .",
    "2013 ) , making it a likely micro - quasar in the shadow of m82 x-1 .    the discovery of s1 , however , does not affect previous results on m82 x-1 s spectral properties significantly ( e.g. , feng et al . 2010 ) .",
    "this is because s1 luminosity , even in its outburst , is only @xmath40 . in comparison ,",
    "m82 x-1 exhibited x - ray luminosities from @xmath41 to @xmath42 ( e.g. , kaaret et al . 2006 ; feng et al .",
    "2010 ) , 30 - 100 times higher than the outburst luminosity of s1 .",
    "furthermore , s1 was detected only once out of 22 chandra observations between 1999 and 2014 , and it must remain in a quiescent state at even lower luminosities most ( @xmath4395% ) of the time . however , s1 could become important for on - axis observations when m82 x-1 suffers severe pile - up . in the case of obs",
    "i d 10543 , the count rate of s1 is almost half of the observed count rate of m82 x-1 .",
