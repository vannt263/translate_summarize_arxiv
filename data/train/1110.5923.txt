    "the study of unstable particles is a basic subject of both nuclear and particle physics .",
    "the fact that the so called survival probability , i.e. the probability @xmath5 that an unstable state @xmath6 formed at the time @xmath7 did not decay at the instant @xmath8 does not follow an exponential decay law for short times is now theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite established in the framework of quantum mechanics .",
    "moreover , oscillations on top of the exponential function can also occur in the short time regime and could eventually last long enough to be detected @xcite . also at very large times deviations take place : a power law , and not an exponential law , is realized @xcite .    in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite the deviation from the exponential decay law has been described in the nonrelativistic quantum mechanical context of lee hamiltonians @xcite : this approach allows to mimic non - relativistic quantum field theory by including a continuum of states . in refs .",
    "@xcite these deviations have been demonstrated in the framework of a genuinely ( superrenormalizable ) relativistic quantum field theoretical lagrangian .",
    "both approaches give rise to qualitative similar deviations from an exponential decay law in the short - time regime and also show an indiction of oscillations afterwards .    in this work",
    "we study the decay of an unstable particle when more than one decay channel is present , both in the context of relativistic quantum field theory ( qft ) and quantum mechanics ( qm ) .",
    "this parallel allows also to show the formal similarities of these two approaches .",
    "the equations presented in this work are general and do not depend on the particular employed model(s ) .",
    "however , it is useful for a clear presentation to work with a well - defined theoretical setup : in qft we employ , in line with refs .",
    "@xcite , scalar fields , which are free from spin complications , in the framework of a superrenormalizable relativistic lagrangian . in the case of qm",
    "we employ lee hamiltonians ( lh ) : we generalize the work of refs .",
    "@xcite in order to describe the decay of an unstable state into two distinct channels .",
    "when ( at least ) two decay channels are present , one has to determine ( both in qft and in qm ) the probability of decay in each channel .",
    "namely , the aim is to calculate ( to our knowledge for the first time ) the decay probability that the unstable particle @xmath6 decays in the @xmath9-th channel between the time interval @xmath0 and @xmath10 .",
    "each partial decay probability deviates from the corresponding breit - wigner limit . in this context",
    "an important quantity under study in the two - channel case is the ratio between the decay probability in the first channel over the decay probability in the second channel . while this quantity is constant in the usual breit - wigner ( bw ) limit and is equal to the ratio @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the tree - level decay widths in the first and the second channel respectively , this is not true in the general case .",
    "there are time intervals in which the ratio of probabilities is larger than @xmath2 , meaning that the decay probability into the first channel is enhanced .",
    "vice - versa , there are time intervals in which the ratio is smaller than @xmath2 , implying that the decay probability into the second channel is enhanced",
    ".    one of the main purposes of this paper is a general and theoretically based presentation of the equations related to the decay probability in each decay channel as function of time . for this reason we do not refer here to any particular physical system , but we keep the presentation as general as possible . yet , in order to improve the understanding of the manuscript we shall present in the qft case several plots of the introduced functions for a selected numerical example .",
    "although the employed superrenormalizable qft model is clearly not the most general qft treatment , the form an the structure of the equations are quite general and could be easily extended to other more complicated and realistic qft approaches .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "2 we give an overview of the qft formalism for the description of the decay of an unstable particle .",
    "we introduce a ( superrenormalizable ) lagrangian density and discuss the relevant properties of the survival probability @xmath5 . in  sec .",
    "3 we turn to the qm study of decays : to this end we introduce the lee hamiltonian , which shows a formally very similar behavior to the qft case of sec .",
    "we review the most important equations in this approach and also present a relativistic generalization of it . in sec .",
    "4 we turn back to qft and discuss in detail the formulae for the two - channel case , with special attention to the decay probability in each channel . for sake of clarity",
    "we concentrate on the case in which two decay channels are available ; the generalization to @xmath11 decay channels is straightforward and is presented in appendix b. in qft the expressions of the decay probabilities in each channel can not be analytically derived in the most general case ; to circumvent this problem , a ` conjecture ' about the form of the solution is put forward .",
    "it is then shown that the conjectured solution fulfills all the necessary requirements .",
    "a numerical study of these solutions is presented , in order to show differences from the usual exponential limit . in sec .",
    "5 we study the same problem of the two - channel decay in qm with the help of lee hamiltonians : in this case it is possible to derive the exact expressions for the decay probabilities in a given channel and we can test the validity of the conjecture presented in the qft case : a numerical study shows a very good agreement of the exact results with the proposed solutions for both the nonrelativistic and relativistic treatments of the lee hamiltonians . finally , in sec .",
