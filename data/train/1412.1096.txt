    "there is a strong evidence that type ii supernovae are explosions of massive stars , involving the gravitational collapse of the stars iron cores @xcite and the ejection of the outer layers .",
    "it is widely thought that the explosion is obtained due to the deposition in the envelope of a small fraction ( @xmath5 ) of the gravitational energy ( @xmath6 ) released in neutrinos from the core , leading to the @xmath7 observed kinetic energy of the ejected material ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* for reviews ) .",
    "one - dimensional ( 1d ) simulations indicate that the neutrinos do not deposit sufficient energy in the envelope to produce the typical @xmath7 kinetic energy .",
    "while some two - dimensional ( 2d ) studies indicate robust explosions @xcite and some indicate failures or weak explosions @xcite , these studies are affected by the assumption of rotational symmetry and by an inverse turbulent energy cascade , which , unlike many physical systems , tends to amplify energy on large scales .",
    "therefore , three - dimensional ( 3d ) studies are necessary to satisfactorily demonstrate the neutrino mechanism , but so far 3d studies have resulted in either failures or weak explosions @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested a different mechanism for the explosion during core - collapse that does not involve the emitted neutrinos .",
    "they suggested that increased burning rates due to the adiabatic heating of the outer shells as they collapse leads to a thermonuclear explosion ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this has the advantage of naturally producing @xmath7 from the thermonuclear burning ( with a gain of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 stands for baryon ) of @xmath10 of light elements .",
    "alternatively , a fraction of @xmath11 naturally explains a velocity scale of supernovae of thousands of @xmath12 that is more robustly observed than the kinetic energy . while this mechanism can operate only if the neutrinos failed to eject the envelope , it would still be possible to see the neutrinos as observed in sn1987a @xcite .",
    "a few 1d studies suggested that this mechanism does not lead to an explosion because the detonation wave is ignited in a supersonic in - falling flow @xcite .",
    "while these studies are discouraging , they only demonstrate that some specific initial stellar profiles do not lead to thermonuclear explosions , and they do not prove that thermonuclear explosions are impossible for all profiles .",

    "* ) and are therefore uncertain .",
    "nevertheless , there are several physical constraints that are likely to hold .",
    "a.   the star contains a degenerate iron core with a mass slightly smaller than the chandrasekhar mass .",
    "b.   the initial profile is in a hydrostatic equilibrium . c.   the profile is stable with a constant or rising entropy ( per unit mass ) as a function of radius .",
    "d.   the local thermonuclear burning time , @xmath13 , at any radius @xmath14 in the profile is much longer than the free - fall time , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 is the internal energy ( per unit mass ) , @xmath19 is the thermonuclear energy production rate ( per unit mass ) , and @xmath20 is the enclosed mass .",
    "we note that the demand for stability may be relaxed if the growth time of perturbations is much longer than the dynamical time , but this is beyond the scope of this work . based on these constraints ,",
    "we adopt the following simple parameterized profile .    1 .   a fixed mass of @xmath21 within @xmath22 is assumed to have already collapsed at @xmath23 and is not simulated .",
    "the hydrogen envelope is ignored and the temperature is set to zero ( @xmath24 in practice ) at the profile s fixed outer radius of @xmath25 .",

    "the inner region @xmath27 has a constant entropy ( per unit mass ) and the outer region @xmath28 has a density profile , @xmath29 ( equal mass @xmath30 per logarithmic radius interval ) .",
    "the requirement of hydrostatic equilibrium implies that the density , pressure , and temperature profiles are set ( up to minor adjustments due to the composition ) by two free parameters that are chosen as the inner density , @xmath31 , and total mass , @xmath32 .",
    "the transition radius , @xmath26 , is adjusted accordingly .",
    "4 .   the composition of the explosive shell is a mixture of helium and oxygen .",
    "this mixture is placed at the outer parts of the profile at radii @xmath33 where the temperatures are sufficiently low such that the ratio between the local burning time and the free - fall time , @xmath34 , is larger than a fixed threshold @xmath35 .",
    "the value of @xmath36 is chosen such that this ratio is exactly @xmath35 . at lower radii ,",

    "we note that significant shells of mixed he  o are not currently expected in non - rotating stellar evolution models .",
    "nevertheless , stellar evolution calculations of rotating massive stars generally predict the existence of a mixed he  o shell @xcite .      to simulate the collapse we use the 1d , lagrangian version of the vulcan code ( for details ; see * ?",
    "* ) , which solves the equations of reactive hydrodynamics with a 13 isotope alpha - chain reaction network ( similar to the 13 isotope network supplied with flash with slightly updated rates for specific reactions , especially fixing a typo for the reaction @xmath42 , which reduced the reaction rate by a factor @xmath43 . ) .",

    "the mass of material that ( freely ) flows through the boundary is added to the original collapsed mass of @xmath21 and is taken into account in the gravitational field .",
    "the results are insensitive to the details of the collapse of the inner parts due to the supersonic flow near the boundary that does not allow information to propagate outward to the outer shells where thermonuclear burning takes place . to verify this , we experimented with other schemes for the collapse of the inner parts ( e.g. , the inner numerical node constrained to free - fall motion until crossing @xmath50 ) , and found negligible effects on our results .",
    "for most of the range of the possible values of the free parameters @xmath51 , and @xmath35 , the thermonuclear burning does not release sufficient energy to unbind the star .",
    "however , there is a range of profiles with reasonable parameters for which successful explosions occur . before discussing the full set of simulations that were performed ( section  [ sec : sensitivity ] ) , we describe in sections  [ sec : example ] and  [ sec : ignition ] one successful explosion .",

    "as it falls , each element is first slightly rarefied and then increasingly compressed .",

    "the ignition process takes place at a subsonic region ( i.e. , outward from the sonic point ) .",
    "an ignition of a detonation in a subsonic region occurred for all simulations in which a successful explosion was obtained .",
    "the detonation wave propagates outward ( panel ( b ) of figure  [ fig : evolution ] at @xmath69 ) , producing thermonuclear energy at a rate of @xmath70 ( figure  [ fig : energetics ] ) .",
    "the pressure built from the accumulating thermonuclear energy manages to halt the inward collapse and cause an expansion that leads to an outward motion .",

    "the condition for the formation of a detonation wave is that the thermal energy increases significantly ( thereby increasing the burning rate ) in a timescale shorter than the time it takes to hydrodynamically distribute the resulting excess pressure .",
    "the latter timescale is given by the sound crossing time @xmath82 of the burning region , where @xmath83 is the speed of sound and @xmath84 is the length scale of the burning region . in case of a well defined burning wave , propagating with a phase velocity @xmath85 , and @xmath86",

    "this runaway process leads to the formation of a shock that is powered by the fast burning in its post shocked region , i.e. , a detonation wave , as seen in @xmath93 .",
    "because of the increased temperature and burning rate , the scale of the burning region decreases substantially , leading to the well known small length scale of thermonuclear detonation waves @xcite .",

    "this demonstrates that a modest resolution ( that can be easily achieved in a full star simulation ) is sufficient to resolve the ignition in this case .",

    "decreasing @xmath35 to @xmath105 ( much smaller values are not possible , since the shell burns before collapse ) slightly increases the asymptotic kinetic energy . for initial compositions of @xmath106 and @xmath107 , asymptotic kinetic energies that were lower by a factor of @xmath108",
    "were obtained , and for @xmath109 and @xmath110 the explosion fails ( not shown in the figure ) .",

    "[ fig : param],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in all cases in which the explosion fails a similar behavior is obtained . while the detonation wave is ignited and produces thermonuclear energy , similarly to the case studied in section  [ sec : example ] , the released thermonuclear energy is smaller than the potential energy of the burning shells and the mass external to them .",
    "we also experimented with other compositions for the explosive shell ( including protons , he , c , o , and heavier elements ) , and explosions were obtained only for he  o mixtures ( with roughly equal mass fractions , as demonstrated above ) .",
    "this result can be understood as follows ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the explosive shell can not be composed only from protons , since the burning time of the mixture should be shorter than the dynamical time of the star and the p+p reaction is too slow ( as it involves a weak reaction ) .",
    "in fact , the explosive shell can not include a significant fraction of protons , despite the possibility of fast proton capture on heavier nuclei .",
    "the reason is that after a few proton captures the resulting nucleus will be too proton - rich for another capture , and the process must include a beta decay , which is too slow .",
    "for example , consider the reactions @xmath116c@xmath117n@xmath118o . since @xmath119f is unstable against proton decay",
    ", further proton captures may proceed only after a beta decay of @xmath120o with a half life of @xmath121 , which is too long .",
    "one can imagine beginning with a roughly equal number of protons and heavier nuclei , but such a mixture is not energetic enough ( see below ) .",
    "another requirement is that the released thermonuclear energy is high enough to overcome the binding energy of the star , which requires a @xmath11 yield ( see section  [ sec : simple ] ) .",
    "mixtures that do not contain significant fractions of he can not fulfill this requirement , as the energy per baryon decreases for heavier nuclei .",
    "these mixtures also typically ignite at high temperatures , when the material is already too deep in the potential well of the star , and the thermonuclear energy has a higher binding energy to overcome .",
    "we did not obtain explosions for pure helium shells , since the triple alpha reaction weakly depends on temperature for the relevant temperature range and the @xmath122 dependence of the reaction is not steep enough to allow ignition after a small amount of infall .",
    "these considerations leave only he  c and he  o as viable mixtures .",
    "it is hard to determine in advance which mixture is better , but our detailed simulations show that explosions can be obtained only for he  o mixtures .",
    "the reason is probably that for he ",
    "o mixtures the steep increase of the reaction rate with temperature happens at a slightly lower temperature than for he  c mixtures .    in summary ,",
    "the required profiles are tuned and require the presence of a mixture of he and o with burning times of @xmath1 ( @xmath2 times the free - fall time ) prior to collapse , which is not currently expected in stellar evolution models . while the uncertainties involved with the pre - collapse final evolution stages of the star do not allow us to determine whether the initial conditions that lead to explosions in 1d are possible , they are probably unlikely .",
    "the numerical experiments described above imply that an explosion is possible , but only for a narrow range of initial profiles . in this section we attempt to provide an approximate analytic explanation for these results .    in successful explosions ,",
    "a detonation wave is formed in a collapsing shell that propagates faster than the infall speed and manages to propagate out . as the wave traverses the progenitor , thermonuclear energy of order @xmath11",
    "is released and ( mostly ) accumulated . at some point",
    "the wave reaches radii where the density is too low to support it and the thermonuclear burning is halted . in successful explosions ,",
    "this energy is greater than the potential energy of the traversed shells and the mass external to them , which is of the order of @xmath76 .",
    "it is implied that there are two basic requirements for a successful thermonuclear explosion in a collapsing star ,    1 .",
    "an ignition of a detonation needs to occur at a sufficiently large radius so that the detonation wave propagates faster than the in - falling material ; and 2 .   the detonation wave should traverse a significant amount of mass ( @xmath123 ) before it fades out in order to allow @xmath7 to be released .",
    "the hydrodynamical collapse is analyzed in section [ sec : collapse ] .",
    "this allows the derivation of approximate conditions for the formation of an outgoing detonation wave .",
    "in addition , it is shown that at any given time , the amount of in - falling mass that is compressed to a density significantly higher than its initial ( lagrangian ) density is very small @xmath124 .",
    "this implies that in successful explosions , most of the contributing thermonuclear burning occurs in regions that have not suffered significant collapse .",
    "the approximate conditions for the thermonuclear burning of a significant amount of mass can therefore be found by analyzing the structure of the initial profile , assuming that a detonation wave traverses it .",
    "this is done in section [ sec : explosion ] .      in order to study the collapse of a mass element , we make the following approximations about the profile in its neighborhood : ( 1 ) @xmath125 is a power - law in radius @xmath126 , ( 2 ) the accumulated mass is independent of radius , and ( 3 ) adiabatic compression is described by a constant adiabatic index @xmath127 . under these reasonable approximations ,",
    "the flow is described by a self - similar solution that is found in the appendix . note that while the self - similar solution assumes these assumptions to hold throughout the profile , the evolution of any given mass element is not sensitive to the profile at distant radii and thus the results are approximately correct for general profiles .",
    "the compression of a mass element as a function of its radius is shown in panel ( a ) of figure  [ fig : ses ] for various values of the power - law index @xmath128 and the adiabatic index @xmath127 .",

    "the compression of the @xmath131 mass element from the simulation of section  [ sec : example ] is shown .",
    "the composition of this mass element is pure oxygen and negligible burning occurs during the compression . as can be seen in the figure , the self - similar solutions agree with the numerical compression to an accuracy of @xmath132 .",
    "the compression at small radii can be obtained as follows .",
    "consider two adjacent mass elements that start at @xmath133 and are initially separated by @xmath134 .",
    "the rarefaction wave reaches the two elements at slightly different times separated by @xmath135 . as the rarefaction wave moves at the speed of sound @xmath136 we have ( using equation ) @xmath137",
    "as the elements fall they reach each radius @xmath14 at slightly different times separated by @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is their instantaneous separation and @xmath140 is their velocity . at small radii , the elements approach free - fall and therefore @xmath141 so that @xmath142 the asymptotic compression is thus given by @xmath143 at small radii , @xmath144 approaches a constant @xmath145the time difference between the arrival at @xmath146 , and we can approximate @xmath147 the values of @xmath148 for different choices of @xmath149 and @xmath127 are given in table  [ tbl : sc ] . as can be seen , @xmath150 .",
    "we therefore expect that at small @xmath14 , @xmath151 which is consistent with the results shown in panel ( a ) of figure  [ fig : ses ] .",
    "the amount of time spent at small radii is short and thus the mass at any given time that is significantly compressed is small , as seen in panel ( b ) of figure  [ fig : ses ] , which shows the compression as a function of mass at a given time , normalized to the total mass of falling material ( i.e. , with negative velocity ) , @xmath152 .",

    "note that the small density jump at @xmath154 is caused by a small amount of thermonuclear burning that is not present in the self - similar solutions .",

    "is also shown .",
    "as can be seen , while the profile is shallower ( mostly due to the deviation from @xmath64 ) , the simple model is confined between the normalization range of @xmath196@xmath197 in the range @xmath198 .",
    "this explains the narrow range of parameters that allows successful explosions , which was obtained in section  [ sec : sensitivity ] . in order to understand the origin of this tight constraint ,",
    "the temperature is plotted as a function of the density in panel ( b ) of figure  [ fig : simple_t_r_rho ] . as can be seen the temperatures and densities are related by @xmath199 with little dependence on @xmath30 (",
    "also holds for the profile from figure  [ fig : initialprofile ] ) .",
    "this reflects the fact that for massive extended stars in hydrostatic equilibrium , the ratio of the photon density @xmath200 to the electron number density @xmath201 is of order unity , as we next demonstrate .    to a good approximation ,",

    "equation demonstrates that there is a tight region for which the density can be high @xmath213 while the temperature is low @xmath214 .",
    "moreover , by relating the temperature to the radius , @xmath215 we see that the small range in temperature corresponds to a small range in radii and therefore a limited amount of mass available for thermonuclear burning by detonation .",
    "in this paper we revisited the collapse - induced thermonuclear supernovae mechanism . in section  [ sec:1d simulations ]",
    "we performed a series of 1d calculations of collapsing massive stars with simplified initial density profiles and various compositions , assuming that the neutrinos had a negligible effect on the outer layers .",
    "we demonstrate that @xmath0 after the core - collapse of a massive star , a successful thermonuclear explosion of the outer shells is possible for some initial density and composition profiles that include a significant layer of he ",

    "the obtained kinetic energies of the ejecta are limited to @xmath3 , which is not sufficient for explaining typical observed type ii supernovae .",
    "the required profiles are tuned ( section  [ sec : sensitivity ] ) and require the presence of a mixture of he and o with burning times of @xmath1 ( @xmath2 times the free - fall time ) prior to collapse , which is not currently expected in stellar evolution models .    in section  [ sec :",
    "simple ] we used simple arguments to demonstrate that for a general family of profiles , satisfying some reasonable constrains , strong explosions may only be possible for a narrow range of density amplitudes .",
    "the detonation wave requires high densities of @xmath216 to propagate .",
    "while the elements are compressed adiabatically as they fall , only a small mass is significantly compressed at any given time ( see panel ( b ) of figure  [ fig : ses ] ) .",
    "a successful explosion thus requires a significant mass of explosive material @xmath217 to be present in the initial profile at high densities .",
    "the high required densities are contrasted by the requirement for low initial temperatures @xmath218 so that the pre - collapse burning rate is much slower than the free - fall time . indeed , hydrostatic equilibrium requires a roughly equal number of photons and electrons where significant mass is present ( see equation  ) , implying that high densities @xmath213 require high temperatures @xmath219 ( see equation  ) .",
    "while the 1d collapse scenarios studied here are therefore unlikely to represent the majority of observed type ii supernovae , they serve as a proof of concept that core - collapse - induced thermonuclear explosions are possible .",
    "in fact , as far as we know , these are the first set of 1d simulations , based on first - principles physics , where a supernova is convincingly demonstrated to occur following core - collapse .",
    "the crucial ingredient in this scenario is the ignition of a detonation wave , which is fully resolved here for the first time ( section  [ sec : ignition ] ) .",
    "further studies are required to examine whether more realistic simulations ( in particular multi - dimensional ) may lead to explosions that better agree with observations and stellar evolution constraints .",
    "unlike neutrino driven explosions , which require the solution of nonthermal transport equations , 3d simulations of this thermonuclear mechanism are possible with current computational capabilities .",
    "an interesting property of the core - collapse - induced thermonuclear explosions reported here is the fact that the potential energy of the star canceled most of the released thermonuclear energy .",
    "this means that even a small increase in the released thermonuclear energy can significantly increase the obtained kinetic energy of the ejecta . to demonstrate this",
    ", we rerun the set of simulations with @xmath53 , @xmath58 and @xmath101 , with increased available thermonuclear energy per unit mass . to achieve this , we change the binding energy of helium , such that the difference in binding energy between the initial composition and the final composition ( assumed to be pure silicon ) increased by a factor @xmath220 .",
    "the results shown in figure  [ fig : fq ] indicate that @xmath221 is enough to increase the kinetic energy of the ejecta to @xmath7 ( which includes post - collapse synthesized material ) .     for @xmath53 , @xmath58 and @xmath101 , with",
