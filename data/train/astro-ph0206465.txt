    "it is now commonly accepted that the radiation from gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) afterglows comes from synchrotron radiation ( e.g. mszros & rees 1997 ) .",
    "since synchrotron emission is strongly polarized ( e.g. rybicki & lightman 1979 ) , one expects to see some level of polarization in grb afterglows .",
    "several models make predictions regarding the amount of polarization one might see in a grb afterglow ( e.g. gruzinov & waxman 1999 ; gruzinov 1999 ; ghisellini & lazzati 1999 ; sari 1999 ) . if the magnetic field is globally random but with a large number of patches ( @xmath4 ) with a coherent magnetic field , the polarization may be high , particularly in early times , depending on the number of patches ( gruzinov & waxman 1999 ; gruzinov 1999 ) .",
    "another alternative is that the field is globally symmetric ( with no net polarization ) but viewing the jet off - axis will break the symmetry and a significant polarization may result ( ghisellini & lazzati 1999 ; sari 1999 ) .",
    "microlensing could also explain a temporarily high polarization ( loeb & perna 1998 ; garnavich , loeb & stanek 2000 ) .",
    "on the observational side , polarization has been measured in several afterglows . @xcite",
    "first detected 1.7% polarization for grb 990510 about @xmath5days after the burst , and @xcite reported about the same amount of polarization for this burst @xmath6days after the burst ; the polarization angle being the same within the error bars .",
    "several measurements for grb 990712 indicated a polarization variability @xcite , from @xmath7 to @xmath8 within @xmath9days while the angle did not appear to change .",
    "grb 020405 was seen by several spacecrafts on 2002 april 05.028773 ( ut ) and ipn triangulation gave a tentative position of the burst @xcite .",
    "prompt optical observations @xcite revealed a new optical source at the position @xmath10 , which turned out to be quickly fading ( hjorth et al . 2002 ; price et al 2002b ; covino et al 2002a ) .",
    "a redshift of @xmath11 was obtained with emission lines of the likely host galaxy @xcite , later refined to @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "polarization observations were reported by covino et al .",
    "( 2002a , 2002b , 2002c ) .",
    "our observations started on 2002 apr  6.268 ut ( @xmath13days after the burst ) with the vatican advanced technology telescope ( vatt ) , where we obtained @xmath14 data .",
    "soon afterwards we also obtained @xmath0-band polarization data ( see sect .",
    "[ sect_pol ] ) with the 6.5 m mmt .",
    "we continued to monitor the optical transient ( ot ) on the vatt and on the mmt for three more nights .",
    "we obtained later - time data on the magellan 6.5 m baade telescope with the magic instrument on apr  14 ( @xmath0 ) and with ldss2 on apr  18 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "we also obtained a deep @xmath15-band exposure on the 100  du pont telescope at las campanas on may  3 .",
    "several standard fields @xcite have been obtained on may  2 to calibrate the data .",
    "our calibration is in good agreement with that reported by simoncelli et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , except for the @xmath0-band where our data are slightly brighter by @xmath16 mag . on the nights of",
    "may  15 and 16 additional unpolarized @xmath0-band data were taken with the 6.5 m mmt to be used as the reference image for the image subtraction software ( see table  [ tbl_obs ] for a summary of our data ) .",
    "for all images the photometry has been extracted using dophot @xcite in fixed position mode .",
    "we made a template image with several images from the first night where the optical afterglow is clearly visible .",
    "however there is always the concern that psf photometry is affected by the underlying galaxy and we found that this is indeed the case here ( see below ) .",
    "for this reason we used the image subtraction program isis @xcite for the @xmath15-band data ; this gave superior results .",
    "our @xmath14 data are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_lc ] .",
    "the time evolution of the grb is described by a power - law @xmath17 . using only isis results for @xmath15-band data obtained before apr  10",
    ", we obtain a slope of @xmath18 . when using all the available data ( including photometry obtained with dophot ) the slope was significantly lower ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "this shows that the psf photometry in all passbands is significantly affected by the galaxy .",
    "an important thing to note is that we do not see any evidence of a break in the light curve between 1.24 and @xmath3days after the burst .",
    "masetti et al . (",
    "2002b ) find no suggestion of a break in the light curve up to @xmath20days after the grb .",
    "once the slope of the decay is known we can interpolate the flux in each passband to a common time and determine the broad - band spectrum .",
    "we chose a common date @xmath1days after the burst , when most of our early data were taken , and when the galaxy s contribution to the observed flux was smallest .",
    "the foreground reddening is @xmath21mag @xcite .",
    "we used the photometric zero points from @xcite to transform the magnitudes to fluxes .",
    "the resulting broad - band spectrum is presented in fig .  [ fig_spectrum ] . after having corrected for reddening ,",
    "we fitted a power law to the spectrum ; the resulting index is @xmath22 .",
    "polarization data for the ot were obtained with the mmt 6.5 m telescope using the minicam imager ( mcleod et al .",
    ", in preparation ) with a set of four melles - griot polarization filters ( mcleod & garnavich , in preparation ) on 2001 apr  6.3 ut , starting @xmath23 days after the burst . we employed @xmath24 binning resulting in a pixel scale of @xmath25 per pixel",
    ". two repetitions of the following sequence were obtained for the ot through the @xmath0-band filter : clear , pol0 , pol45 , pol90 , pol135 .",
    "the polarization data were obtained in less than ideal observing conditions , through thin clouds , high airmass of @xmath26 and rather poor seeing of @xmath27 .",
    "also , on the nights of may  15 and 16 ut additional unpolarized @xmath0-band data were taken with the same instrument to be used as the reference image for the image subtraction software .",
    "the data were processed in two ways : with the psf - fitting code daophot ( stetson 1987 , 1992 ) and with the isis image subtraction package ( alard & lupton 1998 ; alard 2000 ) .",
    "they gave consistent polarization measurements , but with the errors from the image subtraction being about half of those from the psf - fitting , which was not unexpected ( see e.g. mochejska et al .",
    "the isis reduction procedure consists of the following steps : ( 1 ) transformation of all frames to a common @xmath28 coordinate grid ; ( 2 ) construction of a reference image from several best exposures ; ( 3 ) subtraction of each frame from the reference image ; ( 4 ) selection of stars to be measured ; ( 5 ) extraction of photometry from the subtracted images .",
    "this approach allows to use all the information in the image to extract the best photometry .",
    "it also allows us to remove the contribution from any constant , non - polarized flux ( host galaxy ) and to check for possible systematic errors by extracting photometry for other stars in the field . for the reference image",
    "we have used a combination of the best images from april and also images from may 2002 . using the images obtained after the grb has faded ( from may ) has the advantage that we not only measure the flux difference through the different polarization filters , but we also measure the total flux of the ot , thus allowing a more precise measurement of the fractional polarization .",
    "the polarization filters were calibrated under photometric conditions on 2002 march 12 ut by taking v - band images of two polarization standards ( schmidt , elston , & lupie 1992 ) .",
    "the transmission variations among the four polarizing filters were normalized using images of the unpolarized standard g191b2b ( schmidt et al .",
    "note that this normalization happens automatically during isis reductions described above .",
    "for bd+59389 we derive p=0.071 , @xmath29 compared with the accepted value of p=0.067 , @xmath30 .",
    "for hd155197 we derive p=0.046 , @xmath31 , compared with p=0.043 , @xmath32 .",
    "hence , we see calibration errors of @xmath33 and @xmath34",
    ". these errors may be systematic and correctable .",
    "however , because the two calibration stars have nearly the same polarization position angle we have no information on how the error changes as a function of position angle .",
    "therefore we do not attempt to correct our measured polarization , but instead add the calibration error in quadrature to our quoted uncertainty .    the reduction procedure described above resulted in the detection of a strong , @xmath35 polarization 1.3 days after the burst , with each individual measurement having @xmath36 error of @xmath37 ( see table  [ tbl_pol ] ) .",
    "we should stress that for future grbs observed in better conditions the accuracy of individual measurements can be significantly better than 1% .",
    "the resulting polarization measurements for grb020405 are presented and discussed in sect .",
    "[ sect_disc ] .",
    "the procedure described in section  [ sect_pol ] resulted in measuring the flux difference between the minicam observations of the ot taken in may 2002 and those taken in april .",
    "this allows us to obtain the total flux of the ot and also the flux differences as measured through the polarization filters .",
    "these flux differences , after subtracting a slight linear trend consistent with the decay of the ot , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_pol ] . as two polarization sequences were obtained , for each polarization filter two independent values of flux difference were measured .",
    "there is a clear polarization signature present , with the two sequences giving very similar values . including the calibration uncertainty , a sinusoid fit yields @xmath38% for the polarization amplitude and @xmath39 for the polarization angle , with resulting @xmath40 for six remaining degrees of freedom ( compared to @xmath41 if zero polarization is assumed ) . assuming a @xmath42 prior ( polarization can not be negative ) yields a very similar amplitude of @xmath43% .",
    "fits to each individual sequence yielded @xmath44% and @xmath45 for the first sequence , @xmath46% , @xmath47 for the second sequence .",
    "an immediate question is : could this measurement be caused by an instrumental effect ?",
    "this can be checked by constructing identical flux difference curves for the stars in the field , which can be done easily when using the image subtraction method .",
    "most of the stars in the field have flux differences consistent with zero or relatively small ( @xmath48% ) polarization , and no other star shows the same polarization behavior as the ot . in few of the cases",
    "when formally larger ( @xmath49% ) polarization is obtained from the fit , the polarization fits are not statistically acceptable , unlike for the grb .",
    "we consider the detection of large ( @xmath50% ) polarization in the ot of the grb020405 @xmath51 days after the burst to be very secure .",
    "another question to answer is what is the chance that we would measure this level of polarization from random photometric errors alone ?",
    "we created random flux measurements ( @xmath52 ) drawn from a a gaussian distribution with average 1.0 and one - sigma width 0.02 ( our error in magnitude ) .",
    "for each set of measurement we calculate the polarization with @xmath53^{1/2}\\ ] ] this has been repeated ten million times .",
    "the first result is that for a photometric error of 0.03 mag , the most probable polarization is @xmath54% .",
    "the probability of having a polarization larger than 8% from photometric fluctuations alone is 1 in @xmath55 ( for @xmath56 mag ) ; it is 1 in 1000 for @xmath57 mag .",
    "however we have two consecutive sequences of measurements and they are both consistent with @xmath58% polarization . assuming that the errors in each sequence were 0.03 mag , the combined probability is @xmath59 .",
    "this does not account for the fact that the angle is the same for each of our observed sequences .",
    "the inescapable conclusion is that our polarization measurement is not due to chance photometric errors .",
    "we calibrate the polarization to the surrounding star field so any galactic effect would be due to material more distant than the surrounding stars . polarization could arise from the galactic interstellar medium ; however , the foreground reddening is so small [ @xmath60 that it seems impossible that such a small amount of dust would produce such a large polarization .",
    "dust in the immediate surroundings of the grb could also induce some polarization .",
    "however , after correcting for the small galactic reddening , the broad - band @xmath14 spectrum is already very well described by a power law ( fig .",
    "[ fig_spectrum ] ) , which is expected for a grb .",
    "for interstellar polarization one has @xmath61 @xcite , which means that a color excess @xmath62 would be needed to produce the observed amount of polarization .",
    "this would produce a intrinsic broad - band spectrum with a heretical slope of @xmath63 , and a very poor fit in any case .",
    "we thus consider that dust , whether in the host galaxy or in our galaxy , is not the reason for the observed level of polarization .",
    "the interpretation of the high polarization fraction and its apparent rapid variation is problematic in the context of existing models .",
    "the polarization from the afterglow from a beamed gamma - ray burst peaks at twenty percent for a line of sight at the very edge of the jet if the magnetic field is restricted to the plane of the shock , so the combination of an auspicious geometry , highly anisotropic magnetic field , and good timing can account for the observed polarization ( ghisellini & lazzati 1999 ) .",
    "however , the maximum polarized fraction in a beamed gamma - ray burst is found when @xmath64 so the emission will also exhibit a jet break .",
    "the break is quite gradual for the extreme viewing angle required by the high observed polarization .",
    "the spectral index and the decline rate of the flux , when the polarization was observed , reflect emission from an isotropic afterglow ( sari et al .",
    "this is consistent with the expectations of the @xcite model , but subsequent photometric observations would reflect the emission from a jet .",
    "we do not see any evidence for a break in the light curve up to four days after the burst .",
    "alternatively , the high observed polarization may reflect the alignment of the magnetic field over causally connected regions in the observed portion of the afterglow ( gruzinov and waxman 1999 ) . in an isotropic afterglow",
    ", the polarized fraction can reach ten percent if the coherence length of the magnetic field grows at the speed of light . in this case , the high net polarization need not be followed by a break in the light curve .",
    "if the high observed polarization results from either the observation of a beamed afterglow with @xmath64 or an isotropic afterglow with a coherent magnetic field in the plane of the shock , the timescale for the polarization fraction or angle to vary is the time since the burst .    perhaps the properties of the relativistic shock in grb afterglows is somewhat more complicated than is commonly accepted .",
    "the highly variable blazars , bl lac , oj  287 ( angel & stockman 1980 ) and s5  0716 + 714 ( impey et al . 2000 ) , both exhibit polarized fractions up to 20% in the optical and rapid intra - day variability in both the angle and extent of polarization .",
    "the optical emission is thought to come from a relativistic shock ( with @xmath65 ) at a distance of @xmath66 to @xmath67  cm from the central engine .",
    "however , in models of bl lacs , although changes in polarization are not generally accompanied by changes in the flux , the fluxes vary on the same typical timescale ( impey et al .",
    "2000 ) . in the case of grbs",
    "some short term flux variability has been observed .",
    "for instance @xcite did see short term variability in grb 011211 ( @xmath68 mag ) @xmath69days after the burst . in the present case however , any time variability would have had to be periodic with a period very close to our observing cadence ( @xmath70 minutes for the whole sequence ) .",
    "we consider it unlikely that we would have taken our polarization measurements right when a sinusoidal flux variation was happening .",
    "another scenario that can explain a temporarily high polarization is microlensing .",
    "@xcite predicted that polarization of a grb may triple during a microlensing event ( increasing from 4% to 12% ) for a particular model , if the polarized emission emerges of a number of coherent patches @xcite .",
    "the polarization can also vary on a timescale of hours , depending on the impact parameter . @xcite",
    "considered the polarized signature of microlensing if the grb emission is restricted to an annulus of ten percent thickness . in this case , the total emission from the burst may deviate from a power - law trend by up to 40% . as the width of the ring increases , both the peak magnification and the net polarization decrease @xcite .",
    "one should note that polarization measurements obtained one and two nights after our data @xcite show that the polarization was significantly lower , @xmath71% , @xmath72 on apr 7.21 , and @xmath73% , @xmath74 on apr 8.26 . to distinguish between various models will require a polarization light curve .",
    "we can only urge other groups to publish data ( photometry and polarization ) related to this burst in order to obtain a clearer picture of this event .",
