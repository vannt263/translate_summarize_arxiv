    "the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) , in both its level and degree of cosmic evolution , reflects the time integrated history of light production and re - processing in the universe , hence the history of cosmological star - formation . roughly speaking",
    ", its shape must reflect the two humps that characterize the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of galaxies : one arising from starlight and peaking at @xmath5 m ( optical background ) , and one arising from warm dust emission and peaking at @xmath6 m ( infrared background ) .",
    "however , direct measurements of the ebl are hampered by the dominance of foreground emission ( interplanetary dust and galactic emission ) , hence the level of ebl emission is uncertain by a factor of several .",
    "one approach to evaluate the ebl emission level has been modeling the integrated light that arises from an evolving population of galactic stellar populations .",
    "however , uncertainties in the assumed galaxy formation and evolution scenarios , stellar initial mass function , and star formation rate have led to significant discrepancy among models ( e.g. , salamon & stecker 1998 ; malkan & stecker 1998 and stecker & dejager 1998 ; kneiske et al . 2002 and 2004 ; stecker , malkan & scully 2006 ; razzaque , dermer & finke 2009 and finke , razzaque & dermer 2010 ) .",
    "these models have been used to correct observed vhe spectra and deduce ( ebl model dependent ) intrinsic vhe@xmath1-ray emissions .    the opposite approach , of a more phenomenological kind , deduces upper limits on the level of ebl attenuation making basic assumptions on the intrinsic vhe@xmath1-ray shape of agn spectra .",
    "specifically , it was assumed that the latter are described by a power - law photon index @xmath7 ( schroedter 2005 ) , @xmath8 ( e.g. , aharonian et al .",
    "2006 ; mazin & goebel 2007 ; mazin & raue 2007 ) , and @xmath9 ( finke & razzaque 2009 ) .",
    "these assumptions correspond to various possibilities of producing tev spectra .",
    "shock - accelerated electrons are unikely to produce vhe@xmath1-rays with @xmath10 from compton scattering ( e.g. , blandford & eichler 1987 ) . however , either internal @xmath11 absorption ( aharonian et al . 2008 ) , or harder electron spectra at the highest energies in relativistic shocks ( stecker , baring & summerlin 2007 ) , or compton scattering of cmb photons ( bttcher et al . 2008 ) , or top - heavy power - law energy distributions of the emitting electrons ( katarzynski et al .",
    "2006 ) could lead to harder intrinsic tev spectra  not to mention that pion decay from a hadronic source would produce a very hard tev component , irrespective of the lower - energy electron synchrotron spectrum ( mcke et al . 2003 ) .",
    "another proposed approach to derive ebl upper limits involves assuming that a same - slope extrapolation of the observed _ fermi_/lat",
    "he spectrum into the vhe domain exceeds the intrinsic vhe spectrum there ( georganopulos , finke & reyes 2010 ) .",
    "an approach to exploring the redshift evolution of the ebl exploits the gev - tev connection for blazar spectra ( stecker & scully 2010 ) .    a different , but related , approach to constraining the ebl rests on evaluating the collective blazar contribution to the extragalactic @xmath1-ray background when the inescapable electromagnetic cascades of lower - energy photons and electrons , initiated by the interaction of vhe photons with the ebl , are accounted for .",
    "the collective intensity of a cosmological population of vhe@xmath1-ray sources will be attenuated at the highest energies through interaction with the ebl and enhanced at lower energies by the resulting cascade : the strength of the effect depends on the source @xmath1-ray luminosity function and spectral index distribution , and on the ebl model ( venters 2010 ) . the extragalactic @xmath1-ray background , resulting from the contributions of different classes of blazars ,",
    "can then be used to constrain the ebl ( kneiske & mannheim 2008 ; venters , pavlidou & reyes 2009 )  even though the amount of energy flux absorbed and reprocessed is probably only a small fraction of the total extragalactic @xmath1-ray background energy flux ( inoue & totani 2009 ) .",
    "the only unquestionable constraints on the ebl are model - independent lower limits based on galaxy counts ( dole et al .",
    "2006 ; franceschini , rodighiero & vaccari 2008 ) .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the ebl upper limits in the 280@xmath12 m obtained by mazin & raue ( 2007 ) combining results from all known tev blazar spectra ( based on the assumption that the intrinsic @xmath8 ) are only a factor @xmath1322.5 above the absolute lower limits from source counts .",
    "so it would appear that there is little room for additional components like popiii stars ( raue , kneiske & mazin 2009 ; aharonian et al .",
    "2006 ) , unless we miss some fundamental aspects of blazar emission theory ( which have not been observed in local sources , however ) .",
    "an attempt to measure the ebl used the relatively faraway blazar 3c279 as a background light source ( stecker , dejager & salamon 1992 ) , assuming that the intrinsic vhe spectrum was known from extrapolating an apparently perfect @xmath14 power - law differential energy spectrum , known in the interval from 70mev to @xmath155gev from egret data , by a couple of further decades in energy into the vhe regime .",
    "however , blazars are highly variable sources , so it s almost impossible to determine with confidence the intrinsic tev spectrum  which itself can be variable .    in this paper",
    "we propose a method to measure the ebl that improves on stecker et al .",
    "( 1992 ) by making a more realistic assumption on the intrinsic tev spectrum . simultaneous optical / x - ray / he / vhe ( i.e. , ev / kev / gev / tev ) data are crucial to this method , considering the strong and rapid variability displayed by most blazars . after reviewing features of ebl absorption ( sect.2 ) and of the adopted bllac emission model ( sect.3 ) , in sect.4",
    "we describe our technique , in sect.5 we apply it to recent multifrequency observations of pks2155 - 304 and determine the @xmath16 optical depth out to that source s redshift . in sect.6",
    "we discuss our results .",
    "the cross section for the reaction @xmath17 is @xmath18\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( see stecker et al .",
    "1992 ) , where @xmath19 is the thompson cross section and @xmath20 with @xmath21 the angle between the photons of energy , respectively , @xmath22 ( hard ) and @xmath23 ( soft ) .",
    "purely for analytical demonstration purposes we assume , following stecker et al . ( 1992 ) , that @xmath24 is the local number density of ebl photons having energy equal to @xmath23 as appropriate in the mid- to far - infrared ( @xmath2520 - 100 @xmath12 m ) range ( no redshift evolution  as befits the relatively low redshifts currently accessible to cherenkov telescopes ) , @xmath26 is the source redshift , and the cosmology is flat no-@xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the optical depth due to pair - creation attenuation between the source and the earth , @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 being the hubble constant , turns out to be @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "this calculation , although it refers to an idealized case , highlights an important property of the vhe flux attenuation by the @xmath34 interaction : @xmath35 depends both on the distance traveled by the vhe photon ( hence on @xmath36 ) and on the photon s ( measured ) energy @xmath22 .",
    "so the spectrum measured at earth is distorted with respect to the emitted spectrum . in detail",
    ", the expected vhe @xmath1-ray flux at earth will be : @xmath37@xmath38d@xmath39d@xmath40 ( differential ) and @xmath41@xmath15@xmath42@xmath43@xmath44d@xmath39d@xmath45 ( integral ) .",
    "in order to reduce the degrees of freedom , we use a simple one - zone ssc model ( for details see tavecchio , maraschi & ghisellini 1998 , and tavecchio & maraschi 2003 ) .",
    "this has been shown to adequately describe broad - band seds of most high - frequency - peaked bllac objects ( hbls ; e.g. , ghisellini et al .",
    "1998 ) and , for a given source , both its ground and excited states ( tavecchio et al . 2001 ; tagliaferri et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the main support for the one - zone model is that in most such sources the temporal variability is clearly dominated by one characteristic timescale , which implies one dominant characteristic size of the emitting region ( e.g. , anderhub et al .",
    "2009 ) . moreover , one of the most convincing evidence favouring the ssc model is the strict correlation between the variations in the x - ray and in the tev band ( e.g. , fossati et al .",
    "2008 ) . since in the ssc model the emission in the two bands",
    "is produced by the same electrons ( via synchrotron and ssc mechanism , respectively ) , a strict correlation is expected . however , there are ( rare ) exceptions , e.g. the so - called `` orphan '' tev flares ( krawczynski et al",
    ". 2004 ) which are not accompanied by corresponding variations in the x - ray band ; or more complex models than the simple one - zone ssc model may be required to fit the observed variability pattern in some cases ( e.g. , the july 2006 flare of pks2155 - 304 : see costamante 2008 ; but also foschini et al .",
    "2007 and kusunose & takahara 2008 ) .",
    "the emission zone is supposed to be spherical with radius @xmath46 , in relativistic motion with bulk lorentz factor @xmath47 at an angle @xmath48 with respect to the line of sight to the observer , so that special relativistic effects are cumulatively described by the relativistic doppler factor , @xmath49^{-1}$ ] .",
    "relativistic electrons with density @xmath50 and a tangled magnetic field with intensity @xmath51 homogeneously fill the region .",
    "the relativistic electrons spectrum is described by a smoothed broken power - law function of the electron lorentz factor @xmath1 , with limits @xmath52 and @xmath53 and break at @xmath54 and low- and high - energy slopes @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "this purely phenomenological choice is motivated by the observed shape of the bumps in the seds , well represented by two smoothly joined power laws . in calculating the ssc emission we use the full klein - nishina cross section , especially important in shaping the tev spectrum .    as detailed in tavecchio et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , this simple model can be fully constrained by using simultaneous multifrequency observations .",
    "indeed , the model s free parameters are 9 , of which 6 specify the electron energy distribution ( @xmath50 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) , and 3 describe the global properties of the emitting region ( @xmath51 , @xmath46 , @xmath60 ) . on the other hand , from observations",
    "ideally one can derive 9 observational quantities : the slopes of the synchrotron bump after and above the peak @xmath61 ( uniquely connected to @xmath62 ) , the synchrotron and ssc peak frequencies ( @xmath63 ) and luminosities @xmath64 , and the minimum variability timescale @xmath65 which provides an estimate of the size of the sources through @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , once the relevant observational quantities are known , one can uniquely derive the set of ssc parameters .",
    "the method we are proposing stems from the consideration that both the ebl and the intrinsic vhe@xmath1-ray spectra of background sources are fundamentally unknown . in order to measure the ebl at different @xmath36",
    ", one should single out a class of sources that is homogeneous , i.e. it can be described by one same emission model at all redshifts .",
    "this approach is meant to minimize biases that may possibly arise from systematically different sed modelings adopted for different classes of sources at different distances .",
    "so we choose the class of source that has both a relatively simple emission model and the potential of being seen from large distances : bllac objects , i.e. agns whose relativistic jets point directly toward the observer so their luminosities are boosted by a large factor and dominate the source flux with their ssc emission . within bllacs , we propose to use the sub - class of hbl , because their compton peak can be more readily detected by cherenkov telescopes than other types of source , and because their he spectrum can be described as a single ( unbroken ) power law in photon energy , unlikely other types of bllacs ( abdo et al .",
    "2009 ) .    for a given bllac ,",
    "our method relies on using , a simultaneous broad - band sed that samples the optical , x - ray , high - energy ( he : @xmath0mev ) @xmath1-ray ( from the _ fermi _ telescope ) , and vhe@xmath1-ray ( from cherenkov telescopes ) bands .",
    "a given sed will be best - fitted , from optical through he@xmath1-rays , with a synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) model .",
    "[ photons with @xmath67gev are largely unaffected by ebl attenuation ( for reasonable ebl models ) as long as @xmath3 . ]",
    "extrapolating such best - fitting sed model into the vhe regime , we shall assume it represents the source s intrinsic emission .",
    "it should be emphasized that the electrons that are responsible for such  intrinsic  vhe emission are the same that have been simultaneously and cospatially measured through their synchrotron emission in the optical and x - ray bands and the compton emission in the he@xmath1-ray band . as emphasized by coppi & aharonian ( 1999 ) , only if the x - ray/@xmath1-ray variations are consistent with being produced by a common electron ditribution , then it is possible to robustly estimate a bllac s intrinsic tev spectrum from its emission at lower energies .",
    "contrasting measured versus intrinsic emission yields a determination of exp@xmath68 $ ] , the energy - dependent absorption of the vhe emission coming from a source located at redshift @xmath36 due to pair production with intervening ebl photons .",
    "once @xmath69 is known , by assuming a specific cosmology one can derive the ebl photon number density : e.g. , from @xmath70 ( see eq.2 ) , if we have @xmath71 values of @xmath72 for @xmath71 different values of @xmath22 , by adopting a parametric form of @xmath73 in principle we can solve for the @xmath71 coefficients @xmath74 .",
    "using seds from different hbls and , for a given source , from different states of emission , will improve the accuracy of the method by increasing the number of ebl measurements .",
    "setting @xmath75 , repeating the procedure at different redshift shells would allow us to estimate the ebl cosmic evolution rate parameter @xmath76 .",
    "clearly this approach could only have been used starting from the current epoch , because of the availability of _",
    "fermi_/lat data simultaneous with optical and x - ray data that allow us to substantially remove the degeneracy of the ssc model at low energies and hence to estimate , for the first time , the intrinsic tev emission .",
    "the concomitant availability of simultaneous air cherenkov data enables a measurement of the ebl opacity  albeit in a model - dependent way .",
    "we here propose using a homogeneous sample of same - emission sources to derive a coherent , unbiased picture of the ebl .      in order to fit the observed optical , x - ray and he @xmath1-ray flux with the ssc model",
    ", a @xmath78 minimization is used .",
    "we vary the ssc model s 9 parameters by small logarithmic steps .",
    "if the variability timescale of the flux , @xmath65 , is known , one can set @xmath79 , so the free parameters are reduced to 8 .",
    "we assume here @xmath80 : for a plasma with @xmath81@xmath82 and @xmath83(0.1)g ( as generally appropriate for tev bllac jets : e.g. , ghisellini et al .",
    "1998 ; costamante & ghisellini 2002 ; finke , dermer & bttcher 2008 ) , this approximately corresponds to the energy below which coulomb losses exceed the synchrotron losses ( e.g. , rephaeli 1979 ) and hence the electron spectrum bends over and no longer is power - law .",
    "however , in general @xmath84 should be left to vary ",
    "e.g. , cases of a `` narrow '' compton component require @xmath84@xmath151 ( tavecchio et al .",
    "2010 ) .    in order to reduce the run time of the code ,",
    "the steps are adjusted in each run such that , a larger @xmath77 is followed by larger steps .",
    "we apply the procedure described in sect.4 to the simultaneous sed data set of pks2155 - 304 described in aharonian et al .",
    "the data and resulting best - fit ssc model ( from optical through he@xmath1-rays ) are shown in fig.(1 ) .",
    "the extrapolation of the model into the vhe@xmath1-ray range clearly lies below the observational h.e.s.s .",
    "data , progressively so with increasing energy .",
    "we attribute this effect to ebl attenuation , @xmath85@xmath43@xmath86 .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath87 for @xmath22@xmath430.23 , 0.44 , 0.88 , 1.70tev and a source redshift @xmath36@xmath430.116 are , respectively , @xmath88 , 0.48 , 0.80 , and 0.87 .",
    "we note that the sed analysis of aharonian et al .",
    "( 2009 ) was based on a slightly different ssc model , that involved a three - slope ( as opposed to our two - slope ) electron spectrum .",
    "this difference may lead to a somewhat different decreasing wing of the modeled compton hump , and hence to a systematic difference in the derived @xmath87 .",
    "that said , it s however interesting to note that the main parameters describing the plasma blob ( @xmath51 , @xmath60 , @xmath50 ) take on similar values in our best - fit analysis and in aharonian et al .",
    "( 2009 ) . more generally , these parameters are quite similar to those deduced for other @xmath1-ray bllac ( see tavecchio et al .",
    "2010 ) .    in fig.(2 )",
    "we compare our determination of @xmath35 with some recent results ( franceschini et al .",
    "2008 ; gilmore et al . 2009 ; kneiske et al . 2004",
    "; stecker et al .",
    "2006 ; finke et al .",
    "2010 ; raue & mazin 2008 ) .",
    "whereas our values are generally compatible with previously published constraints , we note that our values  that refer to a source redshift @xmath89  closely agree with the corresponding values of franceschini et al .",
    "( 2008 ; see their curve corresponding to @xmath90 ) , which are derived from galaxy number counts and hence represent the light contributed by the stellar populations of galaxies prior to the epoch corresponding to source redshift @xmath26  i.e. , the minimum amount ( i.e. , the guaranteed level ) of ebl ( see also malkan & stecker 2001 ) .",
    "the method for measuring the ebl we have proposed in this paper is admittedly model - dependent .",
    "however , its only requirement is that all the sources used as background beamlights should have one same emission model . in the application proposed here ,",
    "we have used a one - zone ssc model where the electron spectrum was a ( smoothed ) double power law applied to the sed of the hbl object pks2155 - 304 . while this choice was encouraged by the current observational evidence that hbls seem to have , with no exception , single - slope _",
    "fermi_/lat spectra , we could have as well adopted the choice ( aharonian et al .",
    "2009 ) of a triple power law electron spectrum in our search for the best - fit ssc model of pks2155 - 304 s sed .",
    "should the latter electron distribution , or any other ( e.g. , curved ) distribution , be shown to generally provide a better fit to high - quality _ fermi_/lat spectra of hbls , then that would become our choice . in general , what matters to the application of this method , is that _ all _ source seds be fit with one same ssc model .",
    "another assumption implicit in our method is that there is an absolute minimum in the @xmath77 manifold of bllac emission modeling , and that our @xmath77-minimization procedure is actually able to find it .",
    "had that not been the case for pks2155 - 304 , we would have checked whether the derived @xmath35s are appreciably different for different model fits .",

    "<S> it relies on using simultaneous observations of bllac objects in the optical , x - ray , high - energy ( he : @xmath0mev ) @xmath1-ray ( from the fermi telescope ) , and vhe@xmath1-ray ( from cherenkov telescopes ) bands . for each source , </S>",
    "<S> the method involves best - fitting the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from optical through he@xmath1-rays ( the latter being largely unaffected by ebl attenuation as long as @xmath3 ) with a synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) model . </S>",
    "<S> we extrapolate such best - fitting models into the vhe regime , and assume they represent the bllacs intrinsic emission . </S>",
    "<S> contrasting measured versus intrinsic emission leads to a determination of the @xmath4 opacity to vhe photons . using , for each given source , different states of emission will only improve the accuracy of the proposed method . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate this method using recent simultaneous multi - frequency observations of the high - frequency - peaked bllac object pks2155 - 304 and discuss how similar observations can more accurately probe the ebl . </S>"
