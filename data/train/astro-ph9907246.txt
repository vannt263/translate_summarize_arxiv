    "this work is part of a large cycle 7 hst project ( pid 7307 ) to study the formation and evolution of rich star clusters in the lmc .",
    "details and first results can be found in beaulieu ( 1998 ) , elson ( 1998c ) and johnson ( 1998 ) .",
    "we have obtained observations ( with wfpc2 , nicmos and stis ) of 8 rich lmc star clusters .",
    "these clusters have masses @xmath0 10@xmath1m@xmath2  and ages from 20 myr to 12 gyr .",
    "they are grouped into four age pairs and we concentrate here on the youngest cluster pair of ngc1818 and ngc1805 .",
    "ngc1818 is quite well studied ( will 1995 , hunter 1997 , elson 1998a , elson 1998b ) and has a metallicity [ fe / h ] @xmath0 -0.8 , a dynamical time of 1.6 - 10 myr and a relaxation time of 150 - 600 myr ( elson 1987 ) .",
    "little previous work exists for ngc1805 .    for the young clusters",
    "the main aims of the project are : to search for primordial binaries ( elson 1998a , santiago 1999 ) and pre - main sequence stars ( beaulieu 1999 ) , and to place limits on the age spreads amongst the massive stars ( johnson 1999 ) . from the low mass and high mass star formation timescales that we find we will investigate the sequence of star formation .    in this paper",
    "we focus on searching for age spreads amongst the massive stars .",
    "the amount of age spread depends on the timescale for star formation which has important implications for the mechanism which triggered the star formation and for the early evolution of the cluster .",
    "a short ( compared to the dynamical time ) timescale requires a strong perturbation to initiate it , whereas self propagating star formation proceeds on the order of the dynamical time .",
    "the combination of the star formation timescale and the efficiency of the star formation influences the cluster evolution and possible disruption .",
    "the various scenarios are discussed in elson ( 1987 ) .",
    "the amount of age spread also has implications for the process of self enrichment in these clusters which may be expected to occur on the order of a massive star lifetime , @xmath010 myr .",
    "to derive the amount of age spread amongst the massive stars we use colour magnitude diagrams produced from the wfpc2 data .",
    "isochrones with the same metallicity but different ages diverge for the massive stars ( v@xmath318.5 ) producing a colour spread .",
    "for example , at v=16 , stars that are 25 and 40 myr old differ by @xmath00.04 mags in v - i which is similar to our photometric errors .",
    "the wfpc2 images of these clusters ( see the project web page ) were oriented with the cluster core ( and hence the majority of the massive stars ) falling on the planetary camera ( pc ) chip .",
    "here we just present results from the pc , results from all the chips will be presented in johnson ( 1999 )",
    ".      overlaid on the data ( solid lines ) are four isochrones ( bertelli 1994 ) , all with [ fe / h]=-0.7 , and ages of 25 , 40 , 63 and 100 myr .",
    "ngc1818 is known to contain binaries ( elson 1998a ) .",
    "the dashed lines show the position of an equal mass binary sequence for the 25 and 40 myr isochrones .    it can be seen from these figures that the massive stars do exhibit a large colour spread .",
    "however , before attributing this to age , other possibilities have to be ruled out .",
    "possible contributors to the colour spread are binaries , differential stellar rotation and be stars .",
    "further complications are provided by interacting binaries which make young stellar populations appear younger ( in colour magnitude diagrams ) than they really are ( e.g. van bever 1998 ) .",
    "we aim to simulate colour magnitude diagrams including these effects to try and disentangle the various possibilities ( johnson 1999 ) .",
    "however , it is clear from previous observations ( grebel 1997 ) that be stars make a large contribution to the colour spread .",
    "be stars are stars that have at some time shown h@xmath4 emission .",
    "it is thought that this emission comes from a circumstellar disk which also reddens the star colours ( e.g. fabregat et al .",
    "figure  [ fig : bestars ] shows the positions on the ngc1818 colour magnitude diagram of the be stars identified by grebel ( 1997 ) .",
    "it can be seen that these stars show a wide spread in colour , from normal b star colours to some 0.5 mags redder in v - i .",
    "there are still several very red stars in the colour magnitude diagram that are not identified as be stars by grebel . unfortunately the be star phenomenon is known to vary on short timescales , therefore some stars that are be stars ( and therefore redder ) at the time of our hst observations may have appeared as normal b stars at the time of grebel s observations . to eliminate this problem",
    "we have obtained time on the eso ntt to make our own be star identifications .",
