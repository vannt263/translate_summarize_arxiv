    "measurements of the infrared background have been carried out in several wavelength bands . the study of deep galaxy counts at infrared wavelengths has enabled us to resolve a significant fraction of the cosmic far - infrared background ( cfirb ) which contains the accumulated intensity from redshifted and unresolved extragalactic sources .",
    "in addition to point sources , there also exist fluctuations in the surface brightness of extended structure due to neutral interstellar dust in the milky way that is heated by the interstellar radiation field , known as the infrared cirrus @xcite .",
    "moreover , although significant fluctuations from zodiacal emission have not yet been detected @xcite , this component may also contribute to the background fluctuations .",
    "cirrus emission peaks at far - ir wavelengths but was detected in all 4 _ iras _ bands .",
    "the infrared emission from galactic cirrus is usually a function of galactic latitude and is serious for wavelengths longer than 60 @xmath0 m . in many cases , the spatial power spectrum from fluctuations of the dust emission",
    "can be expressed as a simple power - law with the power index of @xmath1 - 3 @xcite .",
    "unresolved sources below the detection limit also create fluctuations in the background , which was indeed detected from infrared space observatory ( iso ) observations @xcite . by using the different properties of spatial fluctuations compared to unresolved sources and cirrus emission ,",
    "some authors @xcite have obtained significant levels of cfirb fluctuation . however , since a dependency of the power index of the cirrus power spectrum on both the wavelength and surface brightness is suggested from recent observations @xcite , we need to understand the spatial property of cirrus fluctuations as a function of galactic latitude .",
    "the japanese _ akari _ ( formerly known as _ astro - f _ ) satellite was launched on february 21st 2006 and is performing an all - sky survey @xcite and deep pointed observations at the north and south ecliptic poles @xcite and other selected areas in 4 far - ir bands to much improved sensitivities , spatial resolutions and wider wavelength coverage than the previous _ iras _ survey over two decades ago .",
    "these far - ir observations will be expected to detect the cfirb via fluctuation analysis .",
    "the actual observing plan may change depending on the in - flight performance of _ akari_. the purpose of this paper is to show the potential possible detection of the cfirb and its expected fluctuation level .",
    "source counts results in the far - ir regime from _ iso _ and _ spitzer _ observations @xcite show a significant evolution in the extragalactic population .",
    "the source count models used in this paper consider two evolutionary scenarios for galaxies revised from our previous luminosity evolution model @xcite and burst evolution model @xcite",
    ". for specific updated evolutionary parameters , see @xcite .",
    "in addition , a brief explanation and the color analysis for the revised models are described in @xcite .    due to the fluctuations from background structure and unresolved sources below the resolution of the telescope beam ,",
    "the detection of sources is usually influenced by confusion effects .",
    "the sky confusion due to cirrus structures depends on sky position , however the source confusion due to unresolved sources remains constant everywhere except for clustering effects of sources and solar system objects .",
    "since the cirrus fluctuations are represented by near - gaussian noise , the final confusion limits @xmath2 can be approximated by the summation of the two confusion noise components : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the sky confusion limit due to cirrus structure , @xmath5 is the source confusion limit and @xmath6 is the sky position . the source confusion estimated with the two evolutionary models of @xcite is 7.6 @xmath7 13 mjy and 55 @xmath7 72 mjy respectively ( lower and upper limit is for luminosity evolution and burst evolution model , respectively ) , for the two wide bands of _ akari _ mission , i.e. , wide - s and wide - l band with central wavelengths of 90 @xmath0 m and 140 @xmath0 m .",
    "the sky confusion can be scaled with the cirrus surface brightness @xcite and fig .",
    "[ fig_final_conf ] shows the final confusion limits for an assumed range of cirrus brightness levels for the _ akari _ mission .",
    "the flux levels from a randomly distributed population of extragalactic sources below the detection limit create fluctuations in the observed background .",
    "the cfirb intensity @xmath8 and fluctuation @xmath9 produced by all sources with a flux below the limiting flux @xmath10 , are obtained from : @xmath11    and    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the flux and @xmath14 are the differential source counts .",
    "the detection limits @xmath15 for _ akari _ estimated from our study including both sky confusion and source confusion @xcite with our revised source counts models @xcite are shown in figure [ fig_final_conf ] . in the dark cirrus fields ,",
    "the confusion limits are expected to be 7.7  13 mjy for the wide - s band and 56  73 mjy for the wide - l band ( lower and upper values are for luminosity and burst evolution models , respectively ) .    due to our better sensitivity , we can resolve more sources from the cfirb compared to previous missions . figs .",
    "[ fig_resol_cfirb ] and [ fig_fluc_cfirb ] show the amount of the resolved cfirb and the cfirb fluctuation for the wide - s and wide - l bands .",
    "the amount of resolved cfirb increases faster ( i.e. , decreasing of cfirb fluctuation ) in the wide - l band compared with that in the wide - s band .",
    "we list the expected cfirb intensity , fluctuation and resolved fraction of cfirb in table [ tab_int_cfirb ] .",
    "the expected 5@xmath16 sensitivity for a diffuse source in _ akari _ s deep imaging mode ( slow scan in 15 arcsec / sec , 2 sec reset ) is 0.34 and 0.56 mjy / sr for the wide - s and wide - l bands respectively @xcite .",
    "though the cfirb intensity expected in both evolutionary models is still below 3@xmath16 sensitivity of the wide - s band , the cfirb fluctuation in the burst evolution model is expected to be stronger than that of the noise ( @xmath1 600 jy@xmath17/sr at 5@xmath16 ) .",
    "however , the detector characteristics may also affect the accurate estimation of the fluctuation @xcite .",
    "in the far - ir range , @xcite and @xcite have studied the detection of the cfirb fluctuation from iso observations in the marano 1 field and the lockman hole , respectively . for comparison , we list our estimated fluctuations in table [ tab_fluc_comp ] .",
    "we find that the observed fluctuations are mostly located between the results predicted from our two evolutionary models except for the observations at 90 @xmath0 m . comparing with the model of @xcite , our estimated fluctuations from the burst evolution model are in good agreement . since the deep observations of _ akari _ will have better sensitivity and resolution over a wider sky area than the _ iso _ observations , we expect that we will be able to obtain more accurate fluctuation levels from our observations .",
    "the estimation of fluctuations from the analysis of spatial power spectrum is usually used in the analysis of the cfirb due to the lack of necessity for accurate absolute calibration .",
    "the power spectrum of cirrus emission at high galactic latitudes ( @xmath18 80 degree ) also has a fluctuation of around 10@xmath19 jy@xmath17/sr at 0.01 arcmin@xmath20 and 160 @xmath0 m and a power index of -2.9 @xmath21 0.5 .",
    "the shaded area in figure [ fig_ps_cfirb ] covers the fluctuations predicted by both evolutionary models . in the wide - l band",
    ", we may require a minimum areal coverage of @xmath1 280 @xmath7 400 arcmin@xmath17 in order to effectively distinguish the cfirb fluctuations in the observed data that will inevitably include both cfirb and cirrus emission .",
    "if we use the wide - s band , the minimum required area coverage increases by a factor of @xmath1 5 .",
    "obviously , as we observe higher cirrus regions , the detection limit becomes worse due to the increasing sky confusion noise , while the cfirb fluctuation becomes larger ( see the figure [ fig_fluc_cfirb ] ) . as can be seen in figure [ fig_cfirb_detlim ]",
    ", the fluctuations show a monotonic increase to medium cirrus regions . in the case of low galactic latitude regions , since the cirrus fluctuation power should be more than 10@xmath22 ( wide - s ) and 10@xmath23 ( wide - l ) jy@xmath17/sr at 0.01 arcmin@xmath20 ( see figure [ fig_ps_cfirb ] ) , it will be difficult to extract the cfirb fluctuation from the analysis of the power spectrum ( note that this cfirb fluctuation has a spatial scale close to the resolution of the detector ) .",
    "however , we expect to detect cfirb fluctuations in most low - to - medium cirrus regions .",
    "while the cfirb fluctuation is expected to be almost constant irrespective of position on the sky , except for low galactic latitude regions ( due to severe sky confusion ) , cirrus fluctuations should be different depending on the regions of sky .",
    "we verified these results by comparing our simulated results with observational data from iso @xcite .",
    "thus , in order to estimate cfirb fluctuations effectively , we need to compare the cirrus fluctuation via observations of regions at different galactic latitudes ( cirrus brightness ) .",
    "the deep observations planned with the _ akari _ mission will enable us to detect the cfirb fluctuation in most regions of low - to - medium cirrus brightness in both the wide - s and wide - l bands . these observations will lead to a better understanding of the cosmic far - infrared background ( cfirb ) - an important key to reveal the evolutionary scenario of galaxies in universe .",
