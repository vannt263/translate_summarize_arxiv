    "in 2006 , two new charm - strange states @xmath1 [ mass : @xmath12 mev , width : @xmath13 mev ] and @xmath14 [ mass : @xmath15 mev , width : @xmath16 mev ] were observed by the babar collaboration in the @xmath17 channel@xcite .",
    "there is no evidence for the @xmath14 and @xmath1 in the @xmath18 or @xmath9 mode and hence their possible @xmath19 quantum numbers can be @xmath20 , etc .",
    "subsequently , the belle collaboration observed a vector state @xmath0 [ mass : @xmath21 mev , width : @xmath22 mev ] in the @xmath17 channel@xcite . since their reported masses and widths are consistent with each other",
    ", the @xmath14 and @xmath0 are believed to refer to a single state with a mass of @xmath23 mev and a width of @xmath24 mev@xcite .",
    "more recently , the @xmath1 and @xmath0 were found again by babar collaboration in both @xmath17 and @xmath18 channels@xcite .",
    "the resulting masses and widths of these two states are @xmath25 and the following ratios of branching fractions were also obtained : @xmath26 the observation of the @xmath1 in both @xmath17 and @xmath18 channels rules out it to be the @xmath27 state , since a @xmath2 @xmath28 state is forbidden to decay into @xmath18 .",
    "its possible spin - parity should be @xmath29 , etc , if the structure at 2.86 gev observed by the babar collaboration in the @xmath17 and @xmath18 channels refer to a single resonance   states , might also exist at about 2.86 gev , as proposed by van beveren and rupp @xcite . ] .",
    "apart from the @xmath0 and @xmath1 , in the @xmath18 channel the babar collaboration also found the evidence for the @xmath30 whose mass and decay properties have been discussed recently in refs.@xcite . here , we shall focus on the implications of the babar s new data on the @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "our main purpose is to check whether the experimental data for these two states can be reasonably accounted for in a simple @xmath28 picture or not .",
    "therefore , the more complex pictures such as multiquark configuration@xcite and two - state structure@xcite are not adopted .",
    "systematic studies on the heavy - light meson spectra in quark models show that the expected @xmath31 masses are about @xmath32 gev for @xmath33 $ ] , @xmath34 gev for @xmath35 $ ] , @xmath36 for @xmath37 $ ] , @xmath38 gev for @xmath39 $ ] , and @xmath40 gev for @xmath41 $ ] , respectively@xcite . only from mass ,",
    "the @xmath42 assignment for the @xmath0 is strongly favored , consistent with the experiment .",
    "it therefore would be most plausible that the @xmath1 is assigned to be either a @xmath43 or a @xmath44 state . in the pure @xmath45-wave or @xmath46-wave @xmath28 picture ,",
    "the decay properties of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 have been studied for several different quantum numbers using various approaches@xcite .",
    "further theoretical efforts are still required in order to explain all the data for decays of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 satisfactorily@xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , the pure @xmath3 and @xmath4 have the same @xmath19 and similar masses , in general , they can mix to produce two physical @xmath43 states lying in the mass region of about @xmath5 gev .",
    "therefore , the observed @xmath0 is most likely a mixture of the @xmath3 and @xmath4@xcite .",
    "if this picture is reasonable , a natural question is whether the @xmath1 can be described as the orthogonal partner of the @xmath0 or not , since in the mass region of about @xmath5 gev , only the @xmath1 is a plausible @xmath43 charm - strange candidate at the present time   was reported by the selex collaboration in the final states @xmath47 and @xmath48@xcite .",
    "various possible interpretations for the @xmath49 turn out to be very unlikely@xcite .",
    "it was even regarded to be an experimental artefact@xcite .",
    "therefore , we do nt consider the possibility of the @xmath49 being the @xmath43 @xmath28@xcite , although its mass is close to the quark model prediction of about 2.66 gev for the @xmath3@xcite . ] .",
    "the masses of the @xmath50 and @xmath51 are much higher than 2.86 gev , we therefore will only focus on the @xmath43 and @xmath44 assignments for the @xmath1 . in the present work we try to clarify ( i ) the possibility of the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 being in fact the mixtures of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 and ( ii ) whether the @xmath1 can be assigned to be a @xmath7 or not by comparing the @xmath2 model predictions for their strong decays with the available experimental data .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss the strong decays of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 for different possible assignments .",
    "the radiative transitions of these two states are given in sec .",
    "the summary and conclusion are given in sec .",
    "in the scenario of the @xmath0 being the mixture of the pure @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the eigenvectors of @xmath0 and its orthogonal partner @xmath52 can be written as @xmath53 is the mixing angle and @xmath54 denotes the mass of the physical state @xmath52 .",
    "we apply eqs.([mix1 ] ) and ( [ mix2 ] ) to @xmath28 rather than @xmath55 states .",
    "when one applies these equations to @xmath55 states , the mixing angle would be opposite in sign to our @xmath56 .    in this work",
    ", we shall employ the @xmath2 model to evaluate the tow - body open - flavor strong decays of the initial state .",
    "the @xmath2 model , also known as the quark pair creation model , has been extensively applied to evaluate the strong decays of mesons from light @xmath57 to heavy @xmath58 , since it gives a considerably good description of many of the observed decay amplitudes and partial widths of hadrons .",
    "some detailed reviews on the @xmath2 model can be found in refs.@xcite .",
    "also , the simple harmonic oscillator ( sho ) approximation for the meson space wave functions is used in the strong decays computations .",
    "this is typical of strong decay calculations and it has been demonstrated that using the more realistic wave functions , such as those obtained from coulomb , plus the linear potential model , does not change the results significantly@xcite .    in the @xmath2 model , the partial widths of the @xmath0 and @xmath52 can be given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 denote the final state mesons , @xmath62 is the final state momentum , and @xmath63 is the partial amplitude . according to the explicit expression for @xmath63 given by our previous work@xcite ,",
    "the input parameters include the light @xmath57 production strength @xmath64 , the sho wave function scalar parameters @xmath65 , and the constituent quarks masses .",
    "the meson effective @xmath65 values used in this work are shown in table 1 .",
    "these effective sho @xmath65 values were obtained by equating the root mean square radius of the sho wave function to that obtained from the simple nonrelativistic potential model proposed by lakhina and swanson@xcite  . in this potential model ,",
    "the zeroth - order hamiltonian is @xmath66 where @xmath67 ; @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) are the mass and spin of the constituent quark @xmath72 ( antiquark @xmath73 ) , respectively ; the parameters were chosen to reproduce reasonably the masses of the low lying charm - strange states @xmath31 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 and are @xmath79 , @xmath80 @xmath81 , @xmath82 gev .",
    "the constituent quarks masses are taken to be @xmath83 gev , @xmath84 gev , and @xmath85 gev .",
    "we take @xmath86 by fitting to the decay @xmath87   mev , @xmath88 ; pdg@xcite : @xmath89 mev , @xmath90 . ] .",
    "the meson masses used to determine the phase space and final state momenta are @xmath91 mev , @xmath92 mev , @xmath93 mev , @xmath94 mev , @xmath95 mev , @xmath96 mev , @xmath97 mev , @xmath98 mev , @xmath99 mev , and @xmath100 mev .",
    "the meson flavor functions follow the conventions of ref.@xcite , for example , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 .",
    ".the meson effective @xmath65 values in mev . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the @xmath0 has the definite @xmath42 and its mass is similar to the quark models expectations for the masses of the pure @xmath105 and @xmath106 @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0 is most likely a mixture of the pure @xmath105 and @xmath106 @xmath28 states .",
    "we first check this possibility by studying its strong decay properties in the @xmath2 model .",
    "our calculations do support this possibility .",
    "we also find the @xmath106 component of the @xmath0 is large , in agreement with the recent lattice qcd study@xcite .",
    "the orthogonal partner of the @xmath0 is predicted to have a width of about @xmath6 mev .",
    "this small decay width maybe result from the node structure in its wave function where the large @xmath105 component is expected to exist .",
    "also , the predicted width of about @xmath6 mev would be helpful to search for and confirm another @xmath43 charm - strange state in the mass region of about @xmath5 gev experimentally .",
    "the observation of the @xmath1 in the @xmath18 and @xmath17 channels makes that it should have @xmath42 , @xmath107 , @xmath44,@xmath108 .",
    "the constituent quark models predictions for the spectra of higher @xmath28 states strongly favor that the @xmath1 is either a @xmath43 or a @xmath44 state",
    ".    if @xmath1 is a @xmath43 @xmath28 , its most plausible assignment would be the orthogonal partner of the @xmath0 based on its mass . in this picture",
    ", we evaluate the strong decay pattern of the @xmath1 .",
    "our results indicate that all the available data on its decays can be well explained .",
    "if the @xmath1 is a @xmath44 @xmath28 , from its mass , it would be a good @xmath109 candidate .",
    "the predicted decay pattern turn out to be also consistent with the data .",
    "therefore , both of these assignments appear likely in the @xmath2 model .",
    "the decay patterns of the above two assignments for the @xmath1 are very different .",
    "the information on the partial widths of @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 is crucial to distinguish these two possibilities .",
    "if further measurements refute these two possible assignments for the @xmath1 , the more complex interpretations such as the tetraquark state or two - state structure would be really necessary .",
    "therefore , the further experimental search of the @xmath1 in the @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 channels is strongly called for .",
    "we do nt consider the possibility of the @xmath1 being a @xmath113 or @xmath114 @xmath28 , since its mass is much lower than the quark models predictions for the @xmath115 and @xmath116 charm - strange mesons .",
    "the results from a constituent quark with effective lagrangians@xcite do nt yet favor this possibility .",
    "we also investigate the @xmath8 radiative transitions of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the experimental studies on the @xmath8 transitions between @xmath1 and @xmath117 charm - strange mesons will also be helpful in determining the quantum numbers of the @xmath1 .    comparing the predicted masses from the quark models and strong decay properties from the @xmath2 model with the babar s new data on the @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    ", we tend to conclude that the @xmath0 can be identified as a mixture of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and the @xmath1 could be either the orthogonal partner of the @xmath0 or the @xmath7 .",
