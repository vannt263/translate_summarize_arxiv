    "dynamics of spatially extended systems has been very well studied in past two decades . on the other hand , in the recent past , the importance of studying networks , their structure and properties has been realized , and researchers from fields ranging from neurodynamics and ecology to social sciences have been extensively working in this area @xcite .",
    "in particular , small world networks @xcite have been studied in many different contexts .",
    "this model is defined in following way : one starts with a structure on a lattice , for instance @xmath2 regular nearest neighbour connections .",
    "each site is now linked with @xmath3 of its nearest neighbors on either side . then each link from a site to its nearest neighbor",
    "is rewired randomly with probability @xmath0 , _ i.e. _ the site is connected to another randomly chosen lattice site .",
    "this model is proposed to mimic real life situations in which non - local connections exist along with predominantly local .",
    "it has been observed in these systems , that starting from a one dimensional chain at @xmath1 , one obtains long - range order at any finite rewiring probability with same critical exponents as in the mean - field case .",
    "newman and moore recover critical exponents for percolation on small world lattices which are the same as for the bethe lattice , i.e. an infinite dimensional case @xcite .",
    "for xy model , medvedyeva _ et al _ conjecture that critical exponents are same as for the mean field case@xcite .",
    "they have confirmed it for @xmath4 and there is good reason to believe that it is true for any @xmath5 ( the obvious difficulty is that one needs to simulate larger and larger lattices at small @xmath0 . )",
    "similar conclusions are reached for the ising model on a small world network .",
    "this strongly suggests that the behavior for any @xmath6 is the same as the behavior for @xmath7 for these models .",
    "dynamical systems are nonequilibrium systems , and in general it would not be very surprising if they have different behavior .",
    "in fact for dynamic transitions in non - equilibrium models there is evidence of transitions at finite @xmath0 .",
    "for instance , the transition to self - sustained oscillations evident in a model of infection spreading occured at finite @xmath0 @xcite .    here",
    "we will try to _ identify the conditions under which we could expect the behavior of nonequilibrium or dynamical systems to be similar to that observed in equilibrium models_. as a case study we use the model of infection spreading showing finite @xmath0 transitions , mentioned above .",
    "first we discuss the model in detail in section 2 .",
    "then in section 3 we study the model with respect to a parameter determining the driving rate of the system .",
    "we show how very slow driving leads to transitions at @xmath8 , as in equilibrium models .",
    "we conclude in section 4 with discussions .",
    "we consider the sirs model of infection spreading on a lattice .",
    "we take a graph of @xmath9 vertices .",
    "each vertex has @xmath3 connections .",
    "each site @xmath10 is assigned value @xmath11 at time @xmath12 .",
    "the variable @xmath11 can take values from 0 to @xmath13 . if @xmath14 , the site @xmath10 is considered susceptible at time @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath15 , it is considered infected and if @xmath16 it is considered to be in the refractory stage at time @xmath12 . for sites which are not susceptible , i.e. @xmath17 , dynamics is simple :    @xmath18 and @xmath19    the dynamics does not depend on the neighbors if the site is not susceptible .",
    "neighbors come into question only while infecting the susceptible site .",
    "the model assumes that only infected sites infect their neighbors .",
    "thus a site susceptible at time @xmath12 , will be infected at time @xmath20 with probability proportional to the fraction of infected sites in its neighborhood . in other words , if @xmath14 , @xmath21 with the probability @xmath22 where @xmath23 are total number of neighbors of site @xmath10 , of which @xmath24 are infected . with probability @xmath25 ,",
    "susceptible site does not change state .",
    "the dynamics for the infected sites is deterministic .",
    "the infected sites slowly become refractory and then eventually become susceptible again .",
    "kuperman and abramson simulated the above model on a small world lattice @xcite .",
    "they observe that the fraction of infected sites at a given time @xmath12 shows oscillations in time for a large value of @xmath0 .",
    "one can view the system as sum of many interacting clusters and at large values of @xmath0 , these clusters get synchronized to each other giving collective oscillations .",
    "it was reported in @xcite that this transition to synchronization indeed occurs at a finite value of @xmath0 , and the transition becomes sharper in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we note the following fact about phase synchronized oscillations .",
    "if all of them become truly synchronized , they will reach value zero at the same time and since there are no infected sites in the lattice , infection will die down .",
    "we want to avoid this , and hence we make a small change in the model .",
    "we add _ quenched disorder _ or sources of infection .",
    "we choose 1% of the total number of sites and keep them in the infectious state forever i.e. @xmath26 for all these sites for all times and @xmath27 .",
    "this guards system against falling into fully synchronized state where there is no further evolution@xcite .",
    "the results in the section below are obtained from our modified sirs model with quenched disorder .",
    "specifically we study the behaviour of the infected sites with respect to @xmath28 , which determines the rate of driving in this model .",
    "we see pronounced fluctuations in the number of infected sites as a function of time .",
    "these fluctuations are periodic with the natural period @xmath13 , which is the timescale for a susceptible site , if infected , to become susceptible again .",
    "1 shows the time evolution of the fraction of infected elements , for @xmath29 , for a particular realization after discarding a long transient .",
    "the figure displays four cases with varying values of @xmath13 ( keeping the ratio @xmath30 fixed ) .",
    "time has been scaled by the natural timescale @xmath13 so that results from different choices of @xmath13 can be easily compared .",
    "it is clear as @xmath13 increases the collective oscillations get more pronounced .",
    "these oscillations essentially indicate the presence of cycles in the outbreak of disease .    for a small fraction of nonlocal connections @xmath0 ,",
    "these oscillations are seen only if @xmath13 , _",
    "i.e _ natural timescale for the disease , is fairly large . on the other hand , for a higher @xmath0 , even smaller @xmath13 yield collective oscillations in the number of infected individuals at a given time",
    "an intuitive reasoning could be given as follows .",
    "for larger @xmath13 the information that a given site is infected can propagate more , since the site stays infected for a longer time . a similar role is played by large @xmath0 , as the information that a given site is infected spreads over several sites in a very small time if one has a lot of nonlocal connections .",
    "this sharing of information leads to collective phenomena like periodic excitations appearing spontaneously in the system . since higher @xmath13 and @xmath0 play similar roles",
    ", one can expect that for higher @xmath13 , we will start seeing collective oscillations even at small @xmath0 .    as an illustrative example of the similar roles played by high @xmath0 and high @xmath13 consider the following : the number of nonlocal connections are certainly important in the spread of disease , as the outbreaks can affect locations far apart geographically ; but timescales also play a role .",
    "for instance , ebola is far more deadly virus than hiv and kills the host much faster as it has a much shorter incubation period .",
    "however , due to the very fact that it kills so swiftly , ebola outbreaks are contained very soon .",
    "the people infected by ebola die very quickly , and so the virus has less time to jump to a new host and spread the disease . if no new victims come in contact with the body fluids of infected people in their short lifetime , the epidemic stops . on the other hand ,",
    "hiv remains a problem worldwide since victim lives longer and has longer time to infect others @xcite .",
    "to see this quantitatively , we study the synchronization parameter , which is the relevant order parameter here .",
    "this is defined as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a geometrical phase corresponding to @xmath33 .",
    "the states @xmath34 are left out of the sum @xcite . as mentioned above , 1% of the sites are quenched in the infectious state during time evolution .",
    "we choose initial conditions in which 10% of the total sites are in the infected state .",
    "the sites which are not quenched , evolve according to the rule mentioned above .",
    "we average over 120 configurations for @xmath35 and compute the above order parameter after waiting for @xmath36 timesteps .    when the system is not synchronized , the phases are widely distributed and the value of @xmath37 is spread widely over the unit circle .",
    "this leads to small @xmath38 .",
    "on the other hand , when the elements are synchronized , @xmath38 is large .",
    "if all elements are strictly synchronized , @xmath38 will be @xmath39 .",
    "2 shows the synchronization parameter @xmath38 obtained as a time average of @xmath40 over 1000 time steps .",
    "subsequently we also average over different realizations of the system .",
    "the different curves are obtained for different values of @xmath13 . a transition in synchronization",
    "can be observed as @xmath0 runs from @xmath41 to @xmath39 .",
    "this transition occurs at values closer to @xmath41 as @xmath13 increases . we must mention that we also carried out the same calculation for @xmath42 where we averaged over 20 configurations and waited for @xmath43 timesteps . as in case of original system , we observe that there is no qualitative change as we do simulations for larger system size , except that the transition becomes sharper .",
    "the original authors postulated that transition to collective oscillations in infected individuals could be related to the following behavior that emerges as one increases @xmath0 . unlike average path length",
    ", the clusterization decreases slowly as a function of @xmath0 and there is an intermediate regime where there is a low average clusterization @xmath44 for a given @xmath0 though the distribution of clusterization at element level @xmath45 is rather broad .",
    "they find that this is precisely the regime when the onset of collective oscillations occurs .",
    "however , in this work , we studied the dynamics of the system for different values of @xmath13 .",
    "this change does not alter topology of underlying network and hence does not affect @xmath44 or dispersion around it .",
    "but the transition is certainly affected .",
    "the fact that the transition can be seen without changing topology of underlying network suggests that _ timescales also play an important role in this transition apart from structure of the network on which dynamics is taking place_.",
    "we studied the transition to phase synchronization in a model for the spread of infection defined on a small world network .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the transition occurs at a finite degree of disorder @xmath0 , unlike equilibrium models where systems behave as random networks even at infinitesimal @xmath0 in the infinite size limit .",
    "we examined this system under variation of a parameter determining the driving rate , and show that the transition point decreases as we drive the system more slowly .",
    "thus it appears that the transition moves to @xmath1 in the very slow driving limit , just as one expects in the equilibrium case .",
    "some earlier studies may also be interpreted in this light .",
    "for instance , it was observed that the transition point of the finite @xmath0 transitions to synchronization in coupled chaotic maps decreases to @xmath1 as the chaoticity of the local map ( which determines the time scales of information loss ) decreases @xcite .",
    "this can be seen to reflect the fact that a transition at @xmath8 is obtained when the rate of lyapunov exponent @xmath46 tends to zero .",
    "the characteristic time scale for information loss in a chaotic system varies as @xmath46 .",
    "so as the time scale reaches infinity , the transition point goes to zero .",
    "we also note fig . 2 in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "there we have plotted the power spectra of the collective field for small world lattices at different values of @xmath0 .",
    "we note that high frequency ( i.e. short timescale ) peaks are seen only at large values of @xmath0 , while small frequency ( large timescale ) peaks are seen even at small @xmath0 .",
    "thus there is a clear interplay between the probability of nonlocal connections @xmath0 and the timescales in the system .",
    "this suggests that in an extended parameter space one can find dynamic transitions at infinitesimal @xmath0 , as in the equilibrium case , in the very slow driving parameter limit .",
