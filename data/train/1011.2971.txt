    "the possibility of lorentz and cpt symmetry violation has been actively explored both theoretically and experimentally in the past recent years .",
    "much of the motivation for considering such possibility come from the vision that spacetime at the planck scales may depart drastically from its continuum description leaving some evidence at low energies , idea that has been reinforced by several candidate fundamental theories .",
    "the possible observability in a form of lorentz violation has also been center of many interests for providing a route to realistic experimental scenarios where to test fundamental physics .",
    "searches for lorentz and cpt violation have been performed in the following contexts : string theory @xcite , standard model extension @xcite , spacetime foam @xcite , loop quantum gravity @xcite , non commutative geometry @xcite , modified dispersion relations @xcite , cosmologically varying scalars @xcite , higher derivative field theory @xcite , ultraviolet regulators @xcite , gravity @xcite , nonlinear electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "the range of their predictions includes all matter sectors and gravity and have been probed by a large number of experimental tests , see the tables in ref .",
    "@xcite . at present the best constraints , coming from astrophysical observational tests , are imposed on photons which also violate discrete cpt symmetry .",
    "for example , from vacuum birefringence one has the bound @xmath2 gev for the chern - simons parameter @xcite and from ultra high energy cosmic rays @xmath0 for the timelike parameter in the myers and pospelov model @xcite .",
    "given such small numbers they are hardly justified for lorentz violating corrections induced from the planck - scale and therefore for all phenomenological purposes they can be set to zero . from this consideration , it has been suggested to extend the myers and pospelov model to include more general backgrounds @xcite .    in the present work we study lorentz violations in the framework of effective field theory with the extra ingredient to be incorporated by means of higher dimensional operators .",
    "typically one has a modified quadratic lagrangian density where some lorentz violating background tensors are contracted with an operator . as formulated in the standard model extension @xcite , these background tensors can be viewed to arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking taking place in an underlying theory .",
    "higher dimensional operators have become more popular in the description of lorentz violation in the last years .",
    "one example is the myers and pospelov model where the lorentz violation is incorporated via a fixed four vector pointing only in the time direction and coupled to a dimension-5 operator .",
    "it has produced bounds from astrophysical observations @xcite , synchrotron radiation @xcite , radiative corrections @xcite , and laboratory tests @xcite .",
    "recently an extension for the photon sector including arbitrary mass dimension operators has also been constructed @xcite .",
    "the incorporation of higher dimensional operators present some challenges and some caution has to be taken .",
    "these theories have been questioned for different reasons and many of the problems can be traced back to the bottomless of the hamiltonian .",
    "that is , usually the theory has an unbound negative energy part which under interactions can couple leading to instabilities . on other hand , solutions of the plane wave ansatz",
    "can depend non analytically on the perturbative parameter , therefore undermining the validity of the effective theory .",
    "the use of higher dimensional operators not necessarily represent these problems , but a comprehensive study under which conditions the effective theory is consistent needs to be performed . in this work",
    "we take some steps in this direction .",
    "we perform a systematic study of the causal , stability and analytical behavior of the effective theories that introduce dimension-5 operators .",
    "we focus on the myers - pospelov modified theory of electrodynamics allowing to consider an arbitrary symmetry breaking four vector .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec",
    "ii , we introduce the myers - pospelov model of electrodynamics with an arbitrary spontaneous symmetry breakdown direction .",
    "the field equations and the dispersion relation are obtained . in sec iii",
    ", we analyze the propagation properties for the isotropic and anisotropic cases , and we emphasize the nonanalyticity and instabilities for the lightlike case . in sec iv , we derive the retarded green functions in the coulomb gauge .",
    "sec v is concerned with the quantum field theory , we obtain the propagator in the lorentz gauge and we study microcausality for the purely spacelike case .",
    "consider the maxwell action in the presence of a current @xmath3 plus the myers and pospelov term @xmath4 where @xmath1 is an external four vector defining the type of background and fixed once for all , @xmath5 is a dimensionless parameter , @xmath6 the planck mass , @xmath7 the electromagnetic field strength tensor and @xmath8 its dual @xcite .    in its original proposal by myers and pospelov the action",
    "has the form @xmath9 resulting from choosing the external four vector in the purely timelike direction @xcite .",
    "this action and its corresponding dispersion relation has been the starting point for numerous phenomenological searches @xcite . in the following",
    "we will extend the above treatment to include more general backgrounds thus considering the general cases for @xmath1 incorporating the spacelike and lightlike cases .    consider the full myers - pospelov action re - expressed as @xmath10 where we have defined @xmath11 .",
    "we observe the resemblance of this expression with the cpt - odd chern simons term @xcite .",
    "this can be better seen by using the notation of the recent standard model extension including nonrenormalizable operators @xcite , where one has @xmath12 @xmath13 for the myers - pospelov and chern - simons modifications respectively .",
    "it can be useful to note that the myers and pospelov parameter is obtained from the replacement @xmath14 .",
    "the field equations for the action ( [ m-p.lagrangian ] ) are @xmath15 which can be rewritten as @xmath16 where @xmath17 by introducing the notation @xmath18 , and the conventions @xmath19 , @xmath20 we can write the electric and magnetic fields as @xmath21 or in vectorial notation @xmath22 @xmath23 in terms of the physical fields for a general @xmath24 we have the field equations @xmath25 @xmath26 together with the usual homogeneous ones @xmath27 using the equations ( [ electrec ] ) and the last of ( [ homoge ] ) and in the absence of sources , we have @xmath28 in order to find the dispersion relation we pass to momentum space by considering the ansatz @xmath29 . replacing above ,",
    "we obtain @xmath30 and solving for the determinant gives us the myers and pospelov covariant dispersion relation @xmath31 which will be crucial for the rest of the work .",
    "in this section we study the solutions to the dispersion relation ( [ disp.relation ] ) when @xmath1 is chosen to be purely timelike , purely spacelike and lightlike .",
    "for each of the resulting effective theories we carry out an analysis over the necessary conditions for stability , causality and analyticity .",
    "effective field theories that incorporate higher dimensional operators to describe perturbative corrections to a conventional field theory may present some drawbacks .",
    "in particular those that include dimension-5 operators as the ones we are interested in here . first , the higher - derivative theory may have unbounded energy from below leading to instabilities problems when interactions come into play .",
    "second , even the slightest inclusion of higher - derivative terms can produce an increase in the degrees of freedom with respect to the unperturbed theory .",
    "both the negative energies and the increase of degrees of freedom are somehow related .",
    "it turns out that in general the degrees of freedom that have been incremented are also responsible for the appearance of negative energies .",
    "moreover , this class of solutions have nonanalytical behavior in the perturbative parameter , that is , they tend to infinity when the perturbative parameters are taken to zero .",
    "some perturbative methods have been developed in order to eliminate these additional degrees of freedom .",
    "the resulting effective theories are shown to have positive and hermitian hamiltonians @xcite . in the next subsection",
    ", we consider the analytical criteria also called perturbative constraint @xcite in order to discriminate whether a theory is a higher derivative theory or not .",
    "[ fig1 ]    we start considering the isotropic four - vector @xmath32 for which the dispersion relation ( [ disp.relation ] ) has the form @xmath33 solving we obtain the frequency solutions @xmath34 with the two polarizations @xmath35 . the solutions correctly reproduces the usual ones in the limit @xmath36 and coincide with those previously derived in @xcite .    for momenta @xmath37 the approximation of ( [ disp.rel-timelike ] ) @xmath38 gives the cubic modifications reported in @xcite . for higher",
    "momenta the approximation is no longer valid for @xmath39 and its imaginary part leads to the loss of unitarity and to instabilities .",
    "this signals the need of an ultraviolet cut - off function in order to avoid runaway solutions .",
    "the quantization of this model restricted to a region of momenta @xmath40 and using pauli - villars regularization methods has been performed in @xcite .    to discuss stability and causality we plot the dispersion relation ( [ disp.rel-timelike ] ) in fig .  1 and consider the necessary conditions discussed in @xcite .",
    "for @xmath41 we observe the possibility to have negative energy by performing an observer lorentz transformation to a boosted frame in which @xmath42 is negative .",
    "for @xmath43 and fixed momentum this occurs when @xmath44 and together with the maximum allowed momentum @xmath45 this leads to the requirement that the allowed concordant frames @xcite in which the quantization will remain consistent are such that the boost velocity restrict to @xmath46 with respect to the rest frame .    consider the group velocity @xmath47 and note that @xmath48 can exceed the speed of light introducing problems of causality . in the next sections we compute the retarded green function which gives us a more transparent way to analyze causality violations in the presence of interactions .      for a generic external four vector @xmath49 the dispersion relation ( [ disp.relation ] ) will be a sixth order polynomial with some roots having imaginary parts .",
    "also , the high order character of the equation makes technically difficult to obtain the exact solutions . to simplify we will restrict to the type of anisotropies introduced by lightlike and purely spacelike preferred vectors .",
    "consider first the lightlike case @xmath49 with @xmath50 , for which the dispersion relation is @xmath51 the solutions are    @xmath52    where @xmath53 and @xmath54 above we have made explicit the relation @xmath50 , defined @xmath55 and considered @xmath56 the angle between @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "consider the approximations of small @xmath59 at linear order : @xmath60 we have two solutions that approximate well the usual solutions when taking the limit @xmath61 and one extra degree of freedom that is nonanalytic in the perturbative parameter .",
    "we expect the lightlike theory to develop negative energies and have nonunitarity evolution .    for the case where @xmath1 is purely spatial @xmath62 we have @xmath63 with roots @xmath64 for small momenta we have at leading order @xmath65 where again @xmath56 is the angle between @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the above expression is very similar to the one given in eq ( [ dr - approx ] ) , but valid for all momenta .",
    "the group and phase velocities are , respectively    @xmath66    and @xmath67 where we have set @xmath68 .",
    "we can distinguish three cases for the dispersion relation ( [ disp.rel-spacelike ] ) :    \\(a ) when @xmath69 and @xmath70 are perpendicular ,    \\(b ) parallel or anti - parallel with @xmath71 ,    \\(c ) directions such that @xmath72 .",
    "[ fig2 ]    for the case ( a ) we recover the usual dispersion relation @xmath73 , also mentioned in @xcite as a blind direction . to analyze the cases ( b ) and ( c ) consider the plots fig .  2 and fig .  3 .",
    "for the cases ( b ) and ( c ) the momentum @xmath74 is outside the light cone which threatens the stability of the theory .",
    "therefore for small momentum we must restrict to the region @xmath75 in order to have concordant frames .",
    "this includes a large number of concordant frames since the boost velocity is very near the light cone .",
    "going to large momenta we have that @xmath39 approaches the constant value @xmath76 for the case ( b ) and it diverges as @xmath77 for the case ( c ) and therefore the velocity group approaches the constant value @xmath78 . in consequence",
    "any finite boost will introduce instabilities in the parallel or anti - parallel directions for high momentum .",
    "we expect to have more concordant frames for propagations approaching the perpendicular direction .",
    "on the other hand we see that @xmath79 can exceed the speed of light which indicates possible violations of microcausality .",
    "in this section to study the causal behavior of the gauge fields in the presence of interactions we compute the retarded green function . as standard",
    "we assume a delta source interaction and to avoid to deal with non - physical degrees of freedom we work in the coulomb gauge @xmath80 .",
    "the transverse green function will be constructed by first reducing the degree of freedom corresponding to @xmath81 .",
    "hence , from ( [ electricfield ] ) and ( [ electrec1 ] ) we replace the non dynamical relation @xmath82 in ( [ electrec ] ) to yield the expression @xmath83 above we have used current conservation @xmath84 and defined the transverse current @xmath85 @xmath86 which can be easily checked to satisfy the conserved equation @xmath87 .",
    "now , provided the gauge field is transverse we have @xmath88 which allows us to rewrite the last term in ( [ eqgauge ] ) and so obtain @xmath89 taking components of the above equation of motion we have @xmath90 where @xmath91.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after some straightforward calculation the transverse retarded green function is given by @xmath92 where the tensor @xmath93 is given in terms of the operators @xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96 the scalar retarded green function @xmath97 is defined to satisfy @xmath98 the fourier transform lead us to the integral @xmath99 where the contour of the curve @xmath100 , in the complex @xmath101 plane , defines the boundary conditions to be imposed on the various green functions .",
    "for the retarded green function the curve is defined above the real axis and is denoted by @xmath102 .",
    "the corresponding scalar function @xmath103 controls the causal behavior of the theory and therefore to study causality will be enough to compute @xmath103 .",
    "for the case @xmath62 the integral ( [ causal - function ] ) is @xmath104 where @xmath105 and the solutions @xmath106 are given by ( [ disp.rel-spacelike ] ) .",
    "we observe that the integral @xmath107 vanishes for @xmath108 since the contour @xmath102 must be closed in the upper half plane therefore failing to enclose any of the poles @xmath106 lying on the real axis .",
    "we have in consequence that causality is preserved for the spacelike background .",
    "consider now @xmath109 , we have from ( [ causal - function ] ) @xmath110 where from ( [ disp.rel-timelike ] ) the solutions are @xmath111 and we have set @xmath112 .    the calculation of @xmath113 will be done in two stages depending on the sign of @xmath114 .",

    "some works have already been started @xcite .",
    "the major interest in this work focuses on the consistency of the effective theories that introduce higher dimensional operators .",
    "therefore it shall be considered preliminary work before any phenomenological computation .",
    "it is well known that higher derivative theories can lead to instabilities , negative norm states , and nonunitarity problems to mention some .",
    "we have found that the purely spacelike theory is free of the previous issues which strengthen the idea to extend the existing searches for planck scale phenomena maintaining dimension-5 operators .",
    "it also opens the concrete possibility to quantize the theory without the introduction of any cut - off function as required in the timelike case .    to summarize ,",
    "we have obtained the covariant dispersion relation for the propagation of photons in all privileged frames .",
    "the timelike , spacelike and lightlike preferred backgrounds have been treated separately for the study of photon kinematic properties . in addition , asymptotes properties of the group velocity , had given us a well idea about causality and stability within the classical theory .",
    "for the timelike case we have found runaway solutions above certain values of momenta which suggest the introduction of a cut - off function .",
    "the quantization of a model and the implementation of such cut - off function has been carried out in @xcite . for the lightlike case we have found additional degrees of freedom with some of them being non analytical . using the criteria of analyticity we have regarded the lightlike theory as a genuine higher - derivative theory . as further work it would be interesting to identify possible negative energies and to analyze in detail potential negative norm states arising in the theory . given the similarity with the chern simons modification it would be interesting also to study possible extended symmetries and on shell field redefinitions @xcite .",
    "we have found that the purely spacelike effective field theory is stable and causal while microcausality is highly suppressed .",
    "it is therefore appropriate to be quantized .",
    "this gives the spacelike myers and pospelov theory the possibility to play a role in future searches for lorentz violation .",
