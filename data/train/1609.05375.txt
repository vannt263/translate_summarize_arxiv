    "the conversion of gas into stars is one of the most fundamental processes in astronomy . yet , despite decades of effort , a simple prescription of star formation ( sf ) that successfully describes all observations of galaxies across a range of halo masses has remained elusive . in broad terms , more massive star - forming galaxies will have larger gas reservoirs ( both atomic and molecular ) and higher global star formation rates ( sfr ) than less massive systems ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , the gas mass fractions in star forming galaxies tend to increase with decreasing mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    empirical correlations between gas properties and various tracers of instantaneous (",
    "using h@xmath2 emission , with a characteristic timescale of @xmath8 10 myr ) or ongoing ( using fuv emission , with a characteristic timescale of @xmath8 100 myr ) sf have been numerous in the literature .",
    "the most common parameterization relates a sfr surface density to a gas surface density :    @xmath9    with the sfr surface density ( @xmath10 ) in units of m@xmath11yr@xmath1kpc@xmath12 , the gas surface density ( @xmath13 ) in units of m@xmath11pc@xmath12 , and @xmath5 being a positive number .",
    "@xcite found that @xmath14 , and similar indices have been derived numerous times over the last half - century ( see elmegreen 2011 for a recent review ) .",
    "for example , @xcite found @xmath15 1.4@xmath70.15 for 61 large spiral galaxies when relating the h@xmath2-based sfr to the total gas surface density ( via both and co observations , where the co is used as a tracer for molecular gas ) .    in a study of this relation on sub - kpc scales",
    ", @xcite found that the relationship between the total gas surface density and the sfr surface density varied dramatically among and within individual spiral galaxies , and that most of the sample showed little or no correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath3 . in an associated paper , @xcite found a molecular schmidt power - law slope of @xmath16 in 18 nearby spiral galaxies ; similarly , @xcite found @xmath15 1.3 - 1.8 for 10 nearby spiral galaxies . in a subsequent study ,",
    "@xcite find no clear evidence for sf thresholds and emphasize that it may not be realistic to expect them .",
    "molecular gas in low mass galaxies remains largely undetectable via traditional co tracers , thus studying the relationship between atomic gas and sf is especially important in these metal - poor low - mass systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , very few detections of co gas exist at metallicities less than @xmath010% z@xmath11 , even in systems that are actively forming stars ( see , e.g. , taylor etal .",
    "1998 , schruba etal .",
    "2012 , warren etal .",
    "2015 ) . for low mass galaxies",
    ", this implies that studying the relationship between @xmath10 and @xmath17 as a function of galaxy mass is necessarily constrained to only the atomic gas component .",
    "it is thus interesting to note that a correlation between @xmath18 and @xmath10 appears to hold in some galaxies and not in others .",
    "for example , @xcite find that @xmath18 and @xmath10 are not related in individual spiral disks .",
    "this can be compared to the results in @xcite , which show that 10@xmath19 cm@xmath12 ( corresponding to 7.9 m@xmath11  pc@xmath12 or 10.6 m@xmath11  pc@xmath12 when accounting for helium ) represents a requisite threshold surface density for massive sf .",
    "similarly , @xcite examined 19 low surface - brightness galaxies and found an apparent threshold in the gas surface density in the range 3 @xmath21 10 m@xmath11  pc@xmath12 below which very little sf ( traced by h@xmath2 ) is observed . extending to even lower masses , @xcite and @xcite",
    "find that all gas in their galaxies with @xmath4 @xmath22 10 m@xmath11  pc@xmath12 ( @xmath6 1.2@xmath2310@xmath19 cm@xmath12 ) have associated sf , but there is no threshold below which sf is not observed ( that is , sf is observed in regions with columns @xmath24",
    "10@xmath19 cm@xmath12 ) .",
    "most recently , @xcite found that the @xmath18 @xmath21 @xmath10 relation for a set of dwarf irregular galaxies was nearly linear .",
    "@xcite find consistency across a range of scales ( 400pc and 1kpc ) and galaxy types , including both low - mass galaxies and more massive spiral disks .",
    "based on the above results , it is not trivial to anticipate where in a galaxy one will observe ongoing sf - regardless of how massive that galaxy is .",
    "knowledge of the properties alone is often insufficient to predict where in a given galaxy the conditions are ripe for sf .",
    "for example , @xcite suggests that molecular gas is a better predictor of sf than the neutral ism .",
    "we examine this issue from the perspective in section  [ s4.2 ] .",
    "in addition to the @xmath17 vs. @xmath10 analysis , we also study the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) , which is a useful metric when discussing where in a galaxy sf is occurring @xcite .",
    "several ways of describing the sfe exist , but for consistency with other surveys we use sfe = @xmath25 with units of yr@xmath1 .",
    "the sfe is more useful than sfr alone to identify where conditions are conducive to sf because it is normalized by the gas mass surface density .",
    "thus , it quantifies the local physical properties in regions where the gas is being turned into stars efficiently : regions of elevated gas surface density which have no young stars associated with them are inefficient , while regions of elevated gas surface density that show co - spatiality with young stars are efficient . conveniently , the inverse of the sfe is the gas depletion time , which is the time required for sf to consume the gas reservoir at the present - day sfr . for a sample of low - mass galaxies ,",
    "@xcite found gas depletion timescales of @xmath010@xmath26 yr , an order of magnitude lower than is estimated for the outer regions of large spiral galaxies @xcite .",

    "the alfalfa survey @xcite has produced one of the largest and most statistically useful catalogs of nearby , gas - rich galaxies to date .",
    "the final alfalfa database will include source parameters for more than 30,000 systems .",
    "with the acquisition of data for alfalfa now complete , a unique database exists to facilitate the study of fundamental galaxy properties across an unprecedented range of physical parameters .",
    "one particularly rich area of exploration that has been enabled by alfalfa is a robustly - populated faint end of the mass function @xcite .",
    "specifically , it is possible to identify a complete sample of gas - bearing , low - mass galaxies by matching the alfalfa database to existing optical survey data .",

    "the sources were observed with hst to derive their distances via the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) method .",

    "we generated a boolean mask based on the dirty cube for use in our deep cleans ( threshold set at 2.5@xmath34 ) .",
    "we also performed residual flux rescaling on our data cubes .",
    "deconvolution of the dirty map induces a difference area between the ` dirty beam ' of the residual map and the ` clean beam ' of the deconvolved map and thus the resultant flux density in the final ` combined ' image ; in order to increase the accuracy of the flux scaling in the final image ( which is the linear sum of the residual map and clean map ) the residual must be rescaling by some factor proportional to the difference in the ( frequency dependent ) ` dirty ' and ` clean beam ' areas .",
    "this is a higher - order correction , as the error on the flux scaling of these observations is primarily limited by the calibration model uncertainties .",
    "the details and motivation for this procedure are discussed in @xcite . following these corrections",

    "the robust data parameters are summarized in table  [ t2 ] .    to produce two - dimensional images from the three - dimensional cubes",

    "our final data products include 4 cubes and 4 moment-0 ( integrated intensity ) maps for each of the 12 galaxies .",
    "the cubes are either natural - weighted or robust - weighted ( explicitly , weighting@xmath35``briggs '' and robust@xmath350.5 ) , and at either native spectral resolution ( 0.82 kms@xmath1  ch@xmath1 ) or spectrally smoothed by a factor of 3 ( 2.46 kms@xmath1  ch@xmath1 ) .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty on our flux densities to be a minimum of 10% , and propagate this throughout the calculation of masses , column densities , and @xmath17 .",
    "this estimate accounts for random noise in our maps as well as errors in flux calibration .",
    "the flux densities of the maps are converted to masses using the standard transformation for optically thin emission :    @xmath36    where m@xmath27 is the mass in m@xmath11 , d is the distance in mpc , and the integral @xmath37@xmath38 is the line flux of the source in jy km s@xmath1 @xcite .",

    "both sources overlap in velocity space ; ngc784 lies almost exactly one half - power beam - width away from agc111164 , and thus the sidelobes from ngc784 are co - spatial with the shield source and are challenging to clean properly .",

    "note that usage of any fuv scaling relation to infer a sfr assumes that sf has been constant over a @xmath0100 myr timescale .",
    "near - ultraviolet ( nuv ) emission is also occasionally converted to a sfr , although fuv is generally preferred over nuv : 1 ) nuv images are more contaminated by foreground stellar sources than fuv images ; 2 ) the nuv emission is generally less reliable for tracing the recent sf since the flux at the redder nuv wavelengths will have a greater contribution from stars with lifetimes @xmath44 10@xmath43 yr @xcite .",

    "since only stars more massive than @xmath017 m@xmath11  can produce significant numbers of photons capable of ionizing neutral hydrogen @xcite , and these stars have very short main sequence lifetimes , the presence of significant recombination line emission requires the presence of such short - lived stars .",
    "due to this direct coupling between the nebular emission and massive sf , various works have used h@xmath2  emission to probe the ongoing sf in spiral and irregular galaxies ( e.g. , kennicutt 1983 , kennicutt 1998 ) .",

    "possible reasons are numerous , including non - constant sf histories , stochasticity in the upper imf , and leakage of ionizing photons , among others @xcite .",
    "the shield galaxies provide a unique perspective on this issue ; as figures  [ fig110482 ] - [ fig749241 ] demonstrate , and as discussed below , some of the shield galaxies harbor only single regions .",

    "the most widely - used conversion from h@xmath2  luminosity to an instantaneous sfr is given by @xcite :    @xmath52    where the sfr@xmath53 is the h@xmath2-based sfr in units of m@xmath11  yr@xmath1 and l@xmath53 is the h@xmath2  luminosity in units of ergs@xmath1 .",

    "the most quiescent systems detected in h@xmath2  are also the most quiescent systems detected in the fuv .",

    "we now examine the complex relationships between the spatial distribution of gas and the spatial distribution of the sf tracers .",
    "we perform this analysis using several different strategies , each of which is discussed in detail below .",
    "first , and most simplistically , we visually inspect the images of each galaxy ( figures  [ fig110482 ] - [ fig749241 ] ) at each of the wavelengths available .",
    "analyzing the morphology of the galaxies allows us to identify parts of a system in which the hi gas and sf tracers are co - spatial , as well as areas in a system which have elevated sf but are devoid of hi gas .",
    "it is also interesting to explore the reasons why this co - spatiality does or does not occur ; the visual arrangement of the sf regions and gas within a galaxy can inform us about how much the sf events disrupt the gas and how long it takes for sf to clear out clumps of atomic gas .",
    "second , we calculate and examine radial profiles of the gas surface density ( @xmath4 , units of m@xmath11pc@xmath12 ) , the h@xmath2-based sfr surface density ( @xmath56 , units of m@xmath11yr@xmath1kpc@xmath12 ) , and the fuv - based sfr surface density ( @xmath57 , units of m@xmath11yr@xmath1kpc@xmath12 ) as functions of radius within each galaxy . in order to be systematic and uniform , all profiles are centered on the fitted center of the hst f606w images as determined by cleangalaxy @xcite ; these positions are the centers of the white ellipses shown in figure  [ ellipses ] .",
    "they are presented as surface densities in concentric annuli , so the axes in these plots are radius ( in kpc ) and @xmath10 or @xmath18 .",
    "figure  [ radprofs ] shows these profiles for all 12 shield galaxies . in general , the profiles show smooth curves while the h@xmath2  and fuv profiles are more choppy and reach the level of noise at smaller radii . in some cases the variations seen in the h@xmath2  curves are reflected in the fuv curves ( e.g. , agc111164 , agc174585 ) , but in other cases the profiles do not mimic each other s shape ( e.g. , agc110482 , agc174605 ) .",
    "the reason for these matchups or discrepancies could be associated with the temporal nature of the h@xmath2  emission compared to fuv : a recently - depleted h@xmath2  region could certainly still be bright in fuv .",
    "third , we plot @xmath10 against @xmath4 in a variety of ways .",
    "one method uses the fuv , h@xmath2 , and emssion within each annulus described above ; the surface densities within the concentric annuli are plotted and a slope is derived from the points with values @xmath44 5@xmath34 .",
    "we present plots of @xmath58 vs. @xmath4 ( using the fuv sfr prescription from mcquinn etal .",
    "2015b ) and @xmath59 vs. @xmath4 ( using the kennicutt 1998 h@xmath2  sfr prescription ) in figures   [ fuvsfe ] and [ k98sfe ] , respectively .",
    "because the h@xmath2  data is often clumpy , not radially extended , and in some cases does not have a good s / n ratio , figure  [ k98sfe ] is difficult to interpret with confidence ; thus , we do not consider this plot in our final assessment of the average k - s slope for the sample .",
    "figure  [ fuvsfe ] includes data for every source in the sample , and because the emission is more smoothly distributed than the h@xmath2 , we have more confidence in using elliptical annuli to find the slope value .",
    "the slopes derived in each of these figures and the sample average are included in table  [ t6 ] ; note that the uncertainties quoted are formal uncertainties only .",
    "fourth , we examine @xmath57 vs. @xmath4 on a per - pixel basis . for this analysis , we use a gaussian kernel to smooth the fuv images to the fwhm of the respective images .",
    "the fuv images are regridded to the fields of view and then both are cropped to a 64@xmath2364 pixel grid ( sufficient to include all detected emission in all galaxies ) .",
    "the resulting plots are shown in figure  [ sfepixcorr ] ; the best - fit regression line to all pixels is shown in red for each galaxy , and the slope @xmath5 of the @xmath10 @xmath60 @xmath61 relation is shown . if @xmath57 and @xmath4 are both high in the same pixels @xmath21 that is , the fuv and emission are co - spatial @xmath21 and they are both relatively low in the same pixels , then we expect a positive slope of the best - fit line . if the @xmath57 falls off more quickly , then the slope is steeper , but if the @xmath4 falls off more quickly , then the slope is shallower .",
    "an inspection of the images shown in figures  [ fig110482 ] through [ fig749241 ] reveals that both the gas and the fuv emission have resolved structure ; further , some sources have significant offsets of versus fuv .",
    "thus , the slopes of the lines are sometimes negative ( e.g. , agc748778 and agc749241 ) , indicating an anti - correlation between the atomic gas and the areas of elevated sf activity .",
    "the slopes of the k - s relations seen in figure  [ sfepixcorr ] and the average slope for the sample are included in table  [ t6 ] .",
    "finally , we show a series diagnostic plots which serve two functions : comparing the and sf properties , and demonstrating potential effects of the physical resolution on a system s peak hi column density and k - s slope .",
    "the first of these , figure  [ coldentrend ] , compares the peak column density of each galaxy to its sfr ( derived from both fuv and from h@xmath2 ) .",
    "this allows us to search for trends related to the maximum surface density detected in a given source .",
    "the second , figure  [ globalsigmas ] , compares the global and sfr surface densities of the shield sample against those in other relevant studies . for the shield galaxies , the global values",
    "are calculated by summing all fuv emission and all emission in concentric annuli that encompass all of the fuv flux ; regions of extended gas are not included in the calculation of the areas .",
    "this plot allows us to contextualize the global sf properties of the shield sample with respect to sources with significantly higher and lower sfr surface densities ; however , we note that the derivation of the sfr is different in each of the included surveys ( kennicutt 1998a , wyder etal .  2009 , roychowdhury etal .  2014 )",

    "note that error bars are shown in the figures , but are often unseen because they are smaller than the points themselves .",
    "all lines - of - best - fit that are fitted to data in the plots have been weighted by their uncertainties .",

    "while it is possible that gravitational interactions among the systems in this structure have contributed to the offset of gas and stars visible in agc749241 , the low recent sf activity found in the galaxy indicates that any gravitational interaction has not had a dramatic impact on the star - forming properties over the past 200 myr .",
    "the discussion above highlights the difficulty of determining a sf `` law '' in extremely low - mass galaxies .",
    "using h@xmath2  images presents challenges ; in a given galaxy , regions are few in number ( at most 3 well - defined clumps in a single shield source ) , faint ( low total luminosity ) , and sometimes offset from the optical centers of the sources . while the use of fuv images has certain advantages ( longer sf timescales , more uniform spatial coverage ) , the physical sizes of the galaxies themselves ( of order 1 kpc or smaller ) present fundamental limitations that are not encountered when undertaking similar studies of more massive galaxy disks .",
    "further , the sources are relatively faint",
    ". neither of these problems would exist for more massive galaxies at the same distances .    despite these challenges , we produce three sets of plots in order to decipher the k - s relation for each of the shield galaxies ( figures  [ fuvsfe ] , [ k98sfe ] , and [ sfepixcorr ] ) .",
    "because two different methodologies were used and two different sf tracers were involved , the slope values derived in the plots vary substantially .",

    "note that the inclusion of agc748778 and agc749241 , both of which have low or negative slopes in the fuv - based figures and are absent from the h@xmath2-based figure , may skew the average slopes to low values .",
    "further , the images used to create all three figures are smoothed to a small degree , effectively smearing out the flux from the peak and possibly making the slopes less dramatic .    comparing the modes of analysis noted above",
    ", we conclude that the pixel - by - pixel correlation method ( figure  [ sfepixcorr ] ) provides the most holistic and reliable representation of the comparative qualities of and recent sf in the shield galaxies .",
    "the uncertainties for the slopes are lower for the pixel - by - pixel method than for the radial profile methods ( figures  [ fuvsfe ] and [ k98sfe ] ) , and the power - law slopes from the pixel - by - pixel method more closely match what would be expected from visual inspection of figures  [ fig110482 ] - [ fig749241 ] .",
    "we also note that the inner annuli used to derive the surface densities and produce figures  [ fuvsfe ] and [ k98sfe ] are sensitive to small changes in the precise positioning of the ellipse centers ; moving in a given direction by a single pixel can include or exclude significant h@xmath2  or uv flux ( moving the aperture by an entire beam size can result in flux changes of 50% or more ) , thus changing the shape of the resulting power - law slope . using figure  [ sfepixcorr ] as our metric",
    ", the k - s slope values of the 12 galaxies break down as follows : 2 sources have @xmath62 , 6 have @xmath63 , and 4 have @xmath64 .",
    "we must note here that our technique for analyzing the k - s relation on sub - kpc scales differs in an important way from other recent studies .",
    "because the galaxies in a given sample all reside at different distances , the physical size scale for each source will be different .",
    "the native resolution of the hi beam will also contribute directly to this size scale : a beam of finer resolution will yield a smaller physical resolution .",

    "we chose not to perform this smoothing , instead keeping the shield galaxies at their native physical resolutions ( see table  [ t2 ] ) .",
    "there are a number of reasons for this decision : first , the minimum common resolution we would have had to smooth to would have been @xmath0600 - 650 pc ( limited unfortunately by those sources which lack vla b - configuration hi data ) .",
    "while this does not pose a serious problem for the things galaxies ( larger spiral galaxies ) or the figgs galaxies ( dwarf galaxies with a mean sample distance of 4.7 mpc ) , the shield survey works with galaxies which are of similar size to figgs but span a factor of two in distance .",
    "our sources are at a mean distance of 8.1 mpc with none closer than 5.1 mpc .",
    "this range in distances means that we can fit fewer resolution elements across a galaxy@xmath21for example , even agc749241 ( at a relatively small distance of 5.62 mpc ) is only @xmath02100 pc across in its hi map , meaning we could fit less than four smoothed resolution elements across the galaxy , effectively smearing out any useful spatial information .",
    "second , the high - resolution data gives us insight into the exact locations of the hi peaks and also lets us see the highest column density hi gas ; if we smoothed all galaxies to a coarser common resolution , our analysis of the hi column density threshold would be less secure .",
    "third , our analysis of the shield galaxies on a variety of fine resolutions demonstrates the breakdown of the k - s relation on small scales , as found in previous studies , such as @xcite .",
    "situations such as agc111977 and agc749241 reveal certain advantages of not fixing the physical resolution : both of these sources have interesting morphologies , with hi peaks that are distinctly offset from the sf tracers .",
    "both of these sources are at a distance of @xmath06 mpc , but agc111977 lacks b - configuration data and thus has a resolution about four times as coarse as agc749241 .",
    "unfortunately , this makes comparing their k - s relations challenging , and it also begs the question : if higher - resolution data was available for agc111977 , what would we see ?",
    "instead of having a slope of @xmath65 0.72@xmath70.18 when the physical resolution is @xmath0690 pc , it might shift to a flat or negative slope , as is the case with agc749241 at a resolution of @xmath0170 pc . likewise , smoothing the data for agc749241 to a coarse resolution might reduce the strength of the anti - correlation we currently see in figure  [ sfepixcorr ] .      based on the analysis in section  [ s4.1 ] and the pixel - by - pixel metric ( figure  [ sfepixcorr ] ) , we divide our sample into three broad categories that share similar characteristics : 1 ) mainly co - spatial and sf regions , found in systems with highest peak column densities and highest total masses ; 2 ) systems which show a range of correlation strengths between and sf regions , and which also span a range of peak column densities ; and 3 ) obvious offsets between and sf peaks , found in systems with the lowest total masses .",
    "these groupings are heterogeneous but useful for comparison purposes .",
    "group 1 contains the systems that most closely resemble the `` expectations '' of active sf in regions of high column density : agc110482 , agc111946 , agc174585 , agc731457 , and agc749237 .",
    "these sources demonstrate the strongest observed correlations between the and sf peaks , and each system reaches a relatively high peak column density ( @xmath22 9@xmath2310@xmath66 cm@xmath12 ) .",
    "it is important to note that the comparative properties of and sf vary among and within these sources : the pixel - by - pixel @xmath5 indices of these sources vary between 0.59 and 2.04 , and agc110482 shows compact regions while agc731457 shows extended h@xmath2  emission and widely extended fuv emission .",
    "these comparatively `` well - behaved '' sources are generally at the higher - mass end of the shield sample .",
    "we include agc749237 in this first group , but note that while some of its ongoing sf is strongly correlated with high mass surface density neutral gas , the highest columns are devoid of sf altogether .",
    "group 2 contains a variety of shield sources which span a range of properties : agc111164 , agc111977 , agc112521 , agc174605 , and agc182595 .",
    "they have moderate peak column densities ( @xmath67 5@xmath2310@xmath66 cm@xmath12 ) and display a range of correlation strengths between these peaks and the regions of sf .",
    "we must also note that the three sources which are lacking b - configuration data are included in this group ; it is likely that their low sensitivity to high column density hi gas contributes to the low hi column densities of those sources which have been grouped here .",
    "visual inspection of the images of these galaxies illustrates some similar traits among these sources .",
    "in general , higher than average columns are nearly co - spatial with sf tracers ( e.g. , agc111164 ) . again , notable issues exist amongst and within the members of this group : agc111977 , for example , harbors extended sf , but the peak is not co - spatial with the highest surface brightness emission . with the exception of agc111164 , these systems also represent the middle of the mass range for the sample .    finally , group 3 contains two highly unusual galaxies : agc748778 and agc749241 .",
    "these systems stand out compared to the other shield galaxies : they harbor the lowest stellar masses @xcite , the narrowest linewidths ( see table  [ t2 ] ) , the weakest h@xmath2  emission , and among the weakest fuv emission .",
    "further , their morphologies are highly unusual compared to the other sample members , in that the gas is significantly offset from the high surface brightness stellar population .",
    "the negative k - s indices highlight the extreme nature of these sources ; with the present data we are unable to determine the origin of the offset of the and the stars , but two scenarios are possible .",
    "one possibility is tidal effects from the local environment near the galaxy .",
    "@xcite examined the environment immediately surrounding each of the shield sources in 3 dimensions using the nearest neighbor metric , and suggested that agc749241 has likely been influenced by the external gravitational perturbations from other systems .",
    "another possible scenario is that both of these galaxies had strong sf events in the past , resulting in the prominent fuv but non - existant h@xmath2  emission seen today . due to their low mass ( both stellar and hi )",
    ", these episodes might have disrupted the central hi gas and , in turn , shut down any further sf .",
    "while the details are complex and depend on the coupling of mechanical feedback energy to the surrounding ism , over time , this could create an apparent offset between the gas and the stars .",
    "while the offsets might appear more extreme in these two systems compared to the rest of the sample , the observed offsets in other galaxies in the sample ( e.g. , agc111977 ) could also be explained by a major sf event disrupting the nearby gas . in this scenario ,",
    "the time elapsed since a major sf event matters greatly : regions would only be co - spatial with the hi gas peaks if the sf event is young or current and hasnt had time to disrupt the gas significantly .",
    "figure  [ resolutionvscolden ] plots the shield galaxies in these three distinct groups to identify trends based on the physical resolution and peak hi column density of each source .",
    "this plot confirms that the peak hi column observed certainly depends on the fineness of the resolution element , indicated by the location of group 2 in comparison to group 1 .",
    "however , group 3 defies this trend , and there exist members of group 1 which have resolutions barely better than members of group 2 yet which have significantly higher hi columns .",
    "we also note that group 2 contains all three galaxies which lack b - configuration data ; this demonstrates the degree to which the high - resolution vla observations allow us to see higher column density hi gas .",
    "figure  [ slopevalsvsresolution ] yields a different perspective .",
    "again , the three groups of galaxies do not mingle very much , and it is apparent that some correlation exists between the physical resolution element for a galaxy and its resulting k - s slope . at smaller resolutions ,",
    "it is more likely that the hi gas will appear offset from the sf regions , resulting in flatter or more negative @xmath5 values .",
    "this trend can also be seen in the images of the galaxies ( figures  [ fig110482 ] - [ fig749241 ] ) and in figure  [ sfepixcorr ] .",
    "these plots together provide evidence for one of our key results : at small physical scales , the k - s relation is no longer valid .      taken as a composite sample , the average of the pixel - by - pixel k - s indices for the shield galaxies is @xmath5 @xmath6 0.68@xmath70.04 ( based on the slopes derived in figure  [ sfepixcorr ] ) . to put this average value and the individual galaxies values in perspective",
    ", we compare to @xcite and @xcite , who find @xmath68 1.0@xmath70.2 for the molecular schmidt law ( only relating @xmath69 and @xmath10 ) in their sample of spiral galaxies .",
    "they do not ultimately base their conclusions on the relation of @xmath4 to @xmath10 because most of their galaxies show little correlation between mass surface density and ongoing sf tracers .",
    "our @xmath5 values are quite similar and our method intentionally parallels theirs ; however , it is important to remain mindful that this comparison is not one - to - one , since we use data exclusively and the studies of @xcite and @xcite account for the molecular phase .",
    "those works conclude that , even for the spirals which are qualitatively different from the shield galaxies in fundamental ways , the sfe varies considerably across their sample and within their individual galaxies .",
    "the conclusion of both studies is that the sfe is set by local environmental factors ( i.e. , sf is internally regulated ; see mcquinn et al .",
    "2015a ) .",
    "other recent work has extended the k - s analysis to other types of galaxies ; figure  [ globalsigmas ] presents this comparison .",
    "a study of low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies by @xcite finds that these sources tend to lie below the canonical composite ( + ) k - s relation from @xcite .",
    "an extrapolation of the slope for these sources would appear even steeper than for the larger and higher surface brightness galaxies . however , the analysis by @xcite of figgs dwarf irregulars yields an @xmath68 0.91@xmath70.24 , which is in excellent agreement with our results .",
    "both of these slopes are clearly shallower than the composite slope from @xcite , indicating a deviation from the canonical k - s law found for higher mass galaxies but in a different manner than found in @xcite .",
    "each of these low - mass galaxy studies@xmath21shield , the lsb galaxy study , and figgs@xmath21assume the molecular component of the gas is negligible .",
    "the authors of the figgs study suggest that their results favor a model of sf where thermal and pressure equilibrium in the ism regulate the rate at which sf occurs , where the thermal pressure in turn is set by supernova feedback .",
    "our analysis leads us to a similar conclusion as those presented in these other works : sf in extremely low - mass galaxies is dominated by stochasticity and random fluctuations in their ism .",
    "using the qualities of gas alone , it is very challenging to predict where a given system will show signs of recent sf .",
    "similarly , knowing the distribution of h@xmath2  and/or fuv emission offers little insight into where we might expect to see high mass surface density .",
    "we do not see strong evidence for a threshold column density above which we see signs of recent sf and below which we do not .",
    "the shield sample contains multiple examples of both `` super - critical '' and `` sub - critical '' gas associated with h@xmath2  and with fuv emission .",
    "as figure  [ coldentrend ] demonstrates , the column density of an region correlates only loosely with its sfr in our sample .",
    "while the differing hi beam dimensions and resulting physical resolutions certainly play a role in determining the highest column density gas detected , a sample - wide trend would not necessarily be borne out by improved resolution for the low column density sources ; agc748778 and agc749241 have only moderate hi column densities despite their fine physical resolutions .",
    "overall , our data suggest that sf does not only occur in regions exceeding the suggested critical column density .",
    "in fact , there does not even seem to be a lower threshold : members of group 2 ( see above ) all have relatively co - spatial ongoing sf and hi peaks , yet they have column densities @xmath67 5@xmath2310@xmath66 cm@xmath12 where the sf is occurring ; members of group 3 have significant fuv emission in regions that are in fact devoid of entirely down to the limits of our observations .",
    "it is apparent from our study of these low - mass dwarf galaxies that is not a useful tracer of sf when used in the k - s relation ; numerous studies have come to similar conclusions @xcite .",
    "additionally , recent studies by @xcite and @xcite have found that low - mass sf galaxies , despite having very low molecular gas fractions , are still able to form massive stars .",
    "this idea is supportive of our results in that high - mass sf has occurred in the metal - poor shield galaxies ; the stochastic nature of sf is certainly a contributing factor to the variation in k - s relations seen in the sample .",
    "we close by commenting on the characteristic gas consumption timescales ( gcts ) of the shield galaxies .",
    "there are two methods of calculating the gct ( the time it would take for the galaxy , at its present - day sfr , to completely use up its neutral hydrogen gas reservoir ) ; the first requires taking the inverse of the total sfe . in this way",
    ", we find an average gct for the sample of @xmath02@xmath2310@xmath70 yr from the global comparison of @xmath10 to @xmath71 .",
    "this is nearly an order of magnitude lower than those found in @xcite for the figgs galaxies , and roughly two orders of magnitude below the timescales derived in the outer regions of spiral galaxies . @xcite and @xcite",
    "find that molecular gcts for the things galaxies are of order @xmath02 @xmath23 10@xmath70 yr . the authors also suggest a mechanism that we conclude is likely at play in our sample as well : microphysics in the interstellar medium below the scales which we can observe ( in the form of random gas motions and stellar feedback ) which govern the formation of molecular gas from .",
    "employing the second method , in which we simply divide the total hi gas mass by the total sfr of the galaxy , we get slightly different results .",
    "this straightforward approach yields an average gct for the shield galaxies of @xmath010@xmath26 yr ; if we ignore the most extreme outlier in the sample ( agc112521 , with a derived gct of @xmath045@xmath2310@xmath70 yr ) , then the average drops to @xmath07@xmath2310@xmath70 yr .",
    "these higher average values show consistency with results for a sample of alfalfa dwarfs , in which the authors found a gct of 8.9@xmath2310@xmath70 yr @xcite .",
    "consumption times derived via both methods are included in table  [ t4 ] .",
    "note that the uncertainties for both modes of calculation are significant .",
    "shield is a systematic investigation of a sample of extremely low - mass dwarf galaxies outside the local group . despite the low column densities observed in many systems , each shield galaxy has a significant fuv luminosity , and we detect h@xmath2  emission in all but two of them .",
    "the ability to compare multi - configuration vla data with sf tracers in other wavelengths allows us to examine , on a local and global scale , the sf `` law '' in these systems .",
    "we calculate @xmath4 and @xmath10 for all sample members and find the sfes .",
    "we derive an index for the kennicutt - schmidt relation via several different methodologies .",
    "the ensemble average index using the pixel correlation mehtod gives @xmath65 0.68@xmath70.04 ; this is in good agreement with other studies of low - mass dwarf galaxies , but is shallower than the canonical k - s relation from @xcite . by comparing the shield results to those from other major nearby galaxy surveys , we find that hi mass and uv - based sfr are strongly correlated over five orders of magnitude .    we stress that any one galaxy in the sample is not representative , and that the values of @xmath5 vary considerably from system to system .",
    "instead , we focus on the narratives of the individual galaxies and their distribution of gaseous and stellar components , which are complex and occasionally puzzling .",
    "the average consumption time for the sample of @xmath02 - 10 gyr suggests that they will consume their gas reservoir over timescales similar to those found in other dwarf galaxy surveys .    at the extremely faint end of the mass function",
    ", these systems appear to be dominated by stochastic motions in their extreme ism .",
    "the local microphysics within the ism of individual galaxies may govern whether or not they show signs of recent sf . based on our data ,",
    "knowledge of the properties holds little predictive power in terms of the resulting sf characteristics .",
    "similarly , we see ongoing or recent sf in unexpected regions of many of the shield galaxies . the observed offsets between gas and stars in the galaxies could originate from tidal interactions , or the offsets might appear based on how much time has elapsed since a major sf event disrupted the central gas component . if causal relationships between atomic gas and sf exist in galaxies in this extreme mass range ( 6.6 @xmath24 log(m@xmath27 ) @xmath24 7.8 ) , these relationships remain elusive with current data .",
    "in addition to the analysis presented here , a companion paper by @xcite studies the hi gas kinematics and dynamics of the shield galaxies .",
