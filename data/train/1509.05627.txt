    "toroidal trapping potentials @xcite for ultracold atoms are essential in many quantum metrology implementations , e.g. , for matter - wave sagnac interferometry @xcite , and as elementary building blocks in the emerging field of atomtronics @xcite .",
    "in fact , ring potentials constitute the simplest nontrivial closed - loop circuits and offer unique features to investigate , for instance , superfluidity and persistent currents @xcite .",
    "angular momentum can be transferred to the atoms in such systems using either light @xcite or by rotating a tunable weak link @xcite .",
    "the latter has been one of the key elements that has opened the possibility to study matter - wave analogues of the superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) @xcite .",

    "@xcite have been proposed for the transport of single atoms @xcite , electrons @xcite , and bose  einstein condensates @xcite between the outermost traps of in - line triple - well potentials .",
    "moreover , two - dimensional ( 2d ) sap processes for three tunnel - coupled harmonic wells in a triangular configuration have recently been discussed for matter - wave interferometry @xcite , and for the generation of atomic states carrying orbital angular momentum @xcite .",
    "it is also worth to highlight that sap has already been experimentally demonstrated for light beams propagating in three evanescently coupled optical waveguides @xcite , and recently discussed for the manipulation of sound propagation in sonic crystals @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate the use of 2d sap processes for the transport of ultracold atoms between the localized ground states of cylindrically symmetric concentric potentials . specifically , we focus on the matter - wave analogues of the well - known quantum - optical rapid adiabatic passage ( rap ) @xcite and stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) @xcite techniques .",

    ", the frequency can be modified by varying the laser intensity that produces the potential @xcite , and the radius of the ring can be changed dynamically using time - averaged adiabatic techniques @xcite .",
    "these matter - wave analogues of rap and stirap are described with a two- and a three - state model , respectively , and the obtained results are found to be in good agreement with the corresponding numerical simulations of the 2d schrdinger equation .",
    "finally , we also investigate the possibility to use sap processes between three concentric ring potentials to transport orbital angular momentum ( oam ) states .",
    "such transport can play a very important role in future atomtronic devices , where oam states are one of the building blocks to study squids @xcite .",
    "however , angular momentum states also introduce extra degrees of freedom which consequently will affect the adiabaticity condition of the 2d sap processes .",
    "it is therefore necessary to check if the adiabatic techniques are still usable in ring type geometries .",
    "for instance , in 1d systems , the energy biases are only affected by the difference in frequencies of the traps . in 2d sap systems , however , the energies of the rings also depend on their radii and thus , coupling and detuning can not be treated as independent parameters .",

    "<S> spatial adiabatic passage processes for ultracold atoms trapped in tunnel - coupled cylindrically symmetric concentric potentials are investigated . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we discuss the matter - wave analogue of the rapid adiabatic passage ( rap ) technique for a high fidelity and robust loading of a single atom into a harmonic ring potential from a harmonic trap , and for its transport between two concentric rings . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider a system of three concentric rings and investigate the transport of a single atom between the innermost and the outermost rings making use of the matter - wave analogue of the stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) technique . </S>",
    "<S> we describe the rap - like and stirap - like dynamics by means of a two- and a three - state models , respectively , obtaining good agreement with the numerical simulations of the corresponding two - dimensional schrdinger equation . </S>"
