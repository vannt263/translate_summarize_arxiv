    "gravitational microlensing has become a powerful tool for the discovery , limiting , and characterization of populations of dark ( and luminous ) objects in the vicinity of the milky way . of great interest",
    "is the interpretation of the handful of events discovered towards the magellanic clouds .",
    "if these events are due to a population of objects in an extended milky way halo , they can be interpreted to represent between 20% and 100% of the dark matter in our galaxy @xcite . however , the most probable masses of these objects lie in the 0.1 to @xmath3 mass range @xcite .",
    "such a large number of objects in this mass range is quite problematic ( e.g. fields , et al .",
    "therefore alternatives to mw halo lensing have been sought to explain the lmc microlensing events .",
    "one alternative , first proposed by sahu ( 1994a ) , suggests that stars within the lmc itself , lensing other lmc stars , could produce the observed optical depth .",
    "this claim has been disputed by several other groups @xcite , who claim that the rate of lmc self - lensing is far too low to account for the observed rate .",
    "it was hoped that observation along a different line of sight ( i.e. towards the smc ) would resolve this issue .",
    "after 5 years of monitoring , there have been two observed microlensing events towards the smc .",
    "the more recent smc event was a resolved binary lens event @xcite , allowing determination of the lens distance @xcite .",
    "the lens was found to lie , with high probability , in the smc and not in the milky way halo .",
    "there is also evidence that the only other smc microlensing event @xcite may reside in the smc @xcite .",
    "thus all of the relevant lenses whose distances are known are thought to reside in the magellanic clouds .",
    "this has been interpreted by some as settling the case in favor of the lmc / lmc self lensing interpretation of the lmc events .",
    "this conclusion is not well - founded if based solely on the smc events .",
    "the reason , as we discuss below , is fairly simple  the smc is known to be extended along the line - of - sight , while there is little evidence that the lmc is similarly extended .",
    "in fact , the observations imply that the lmc is distributed as a thin disk , quite unlike its smaller sibling . thus ,",
    "unfortunately , the smc microlensing events do not settle the question of the interpretation of the lmc events , and the controversy remains .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide a set of calculations of lmc microlensing that treats lmc self - lensing in a systematic , thorough fashion .",
    "we relate the known lmc observations to microlensing predictions , and provide a framework in which future observations will easily translate into microlensing predictions .",
    "we hope this will serve as a general basis for comparison between observation and theory in the future .",
    "overall , we find that self lensing models typically suffer two major defects .",
    "first , it is quite difficult for such models to produce enough lensing to account for the observed optical depth , while remaining within the bounds set by observation .",
    "second , the optical depth due to disk or bar self - lensing is strongly concentrated on the sky , in contrast to the rather uniform distribution of events seen to date .",
    "these two statements have a major caveat : if the lmc lenses are distributed in an extended or halo - like geometry , it is possible to produce the required optical depth , and the central concentration of the predicted events is significantly diminished .",
    "such an extended or halo - like distribution , however , requires either an hitherto undetected stellar population , or a dark macho component to the lmc halo .",
    "if a dark lmc halo is invoked , then one might expect it to have a similar fraction of dark machos as the milky way halo . otherwise , the presence of such a component in the lmc but not in the galactic halo would be puzzling . on the other hand ,",
    "if a stellar lmc halo with a luminosity function similar to the disk is invoked , direct observation of these lmc halo stars should be possible .",
    "indeed , as we review below , several stellar populations which correspond to stars that do trace the spheroid in our galaxy have been observed in the lmc , and _ all _ of them fail to exhibit a halo geometry .",
    "therefore , current observations suggest that the number of stars in any such stellar halo is small , and that an lmc stellar halo probably does not greatly contribute to microlensing .",
    "the first and main reason that previous work has produced such discordant results is that different papers have treated the lmc differently .",
    "for example , gould ( 1995 ) and alcock et al .",
    "( 1997 ) treated the lmc as a thin exponential disk , while sahu ( 1994a ) and aubourg et al .",
    "( 1999 ) modeled the lmc as being much more extended along the line of sight .",
    "these two qualitatively different prescriptions give wildly different predictions for the optical depth and rate of self - lensing .",
    "the reason for this is simple .",
    "the rate of microlensing is proportional to the einstein radius of the lenses , which is given by @xmath4^{1/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the schwarzschild radius of the lens , @xmath6 is the angular diameter distance between the observer and lens , @xmath7 is the distance between the lens and source , and @xmath8 is the distance between observer and source .",
    "the einstein radius ( and thus the microlensing rate ) tends to zero as the lens and source approach each other . in the language of griest ( 1991 ) ,",
    "the `` einstein tube '' pinches off at the ends .",
    "therefore , if the lenses are confined to a thin plane along with the sources , the microlensing rate must be small . on the other hand , if the lenses are allowed to move away from the sources , the rate increases",
    "this principle is clearly demonstrated in the smc . due to its interactions with the lmc and the mw ,",
    "the smc is being tidally disrupted and is consequently quite elongated along the line of sight to the mw @xcite .",
    "this allows stars within the smc to be along the same line of sight to us , but separated from each other .",
    "consequently , we expect appreciable self - lensing within the smc , and this expectation is borne out by the large observed smc self - lensing rate @xcite . indeed , eros 2 reports an observed smc optical depth of @xmath9 @xcite , and employing the simple model palanque - delabrouille et al .",
    "use to describe the smc disk , we find predicted self - lensing optical depths of 1.5 , 3.0 , and @xmath10 for smc vertical scale heights of 2.5 , 5.0 , and 7.5 kpc respectively .",
    "( we note that these numbers do not agree with the predicted optical depths that palanque - delabrouille et al .",
    "report , but we are confident that our values are correct . )    to answer the question of whether lmc self - lensing is significant , we must understand the distribution of stars within the lmc .",
    "if the lmc is a thin disk , then the small rates and optical depths derived by gould and others will be valid .",
    "conversely , if the lmc is puffy , then the large rates and optical depths claimed by sahu and others will be correct .",
    "the basis for any description of the lmc is the set of observations that have been made of the lmc .",
    "we therefore turn to the current state of observations of the lmc .",
    "since the pioneering work of de vaucoleurs ( 1957 ) , it has been well accepted that the stellar component of the lmc has an exponential profile . the value de",
    "vaucoleurs measured for the exponential scale length , @xmath11 , continues to agree with the current value of @xmath12 @xcite , which corresponds to a physical scale length of 1.6 kpc for a distance to the lmc of 50 kpc .",
    "in addition to this stellar population , the lmc possesses significant quantities of hi gas , which has recently been mapped out by kim et al .",
    "their images show clear spiral structure in the gas , supporting the notion that the lmc is a typical dwarf spiral galaxy .",
    "the gas is confined to a thin disk , inclined at roughly @xmath13 , with a position angle @xmath14 .",
    "see westerlund ( 1998 , p. 30 ) for a compilation of various estimates of the lmc orientation , as well as kim et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for a recent value . based on these observations , in this paper",
    "we describe the stellar disk by a double exponential profile , given by @xmath15 where @xmath11 is the radial scale length , @xmath16 is the vertical scale height , and @xmath17 is the disk mass . note that @xmath11 is well constrained by observation , but we have some leeway in the scale height and in the mass of the disk .",
    "we discuss these two quantities in more detail later .",
    "the disk is inclined at angle @xmath18 to our line of sight and has position angle pa .",
    "as is well known , the lmc hosts a prominent bar , of size roughly @xmath19 .",
    "the bar has the unusual ( although not unique , e.g. freeman 1996 , odewahn 1996 ) property of being offset from the dynamical center of the hi gas .",
    "the offset is @xmath20 @xcite , corresponding to a physical offset of @xmath21 kpc .",
    "the kinematics of the lmc bar are consistent with solid body rotation @xcite , as is seen in numerous barred galaxies .",
    "the distribution of matter within the bar is not well known .",
    "measurements of the luminosity function , after subtraction of disk light , show it to be consistent with an exponential profile along the major axis @xcite . this is consistent with certain other bars , which can be well described by an exponential along the major axis and a gaussian profile along the minor axis @xcite . for our own galactic bar , dwek , et al .",
    "( 1995 ) have proposed a profile similar to a gaussian , but more boxy , and this form is also consistent with bars in certain other galaxies .",
    "thus , unlike the disk , the bar is not particularly well defined . with little guidance from observations ,",
    "we have treated the bar simply as a triaxial gaussian , with axis ratios chosen to match the observed ratios .",
    "we let @xmath22},\\ ] ] where @xmath23 are coordinates along the principal axes of the bar , and @xmath24 are the scale lengths along the three axes .",
    "@xmath25 is the total mass of the bar .",
    "this form is somewhat similar to models used to describe other galactic bars , e.g. @xcite .",
    "we place the bar in the same plane as the disk , however we place the bar center at the position of the observed bar centroid , at ( @xmath26 ) @xcite .",
    "we use a position angle for the bar of @xmath27 .",
    "it is not clear , at this point , how great an influence the bar exerts over the dynamics of the surrounding gas and stars . in many barred galaxies ,",
    "the bars sweep up gas and drive it towards the center @xcite . in our own galaxy ,",
    "the kinematics of gas in the inner regions is strongly influenced by the putative bar @xcite . while there is evidence for non - axisymmetric flows in the vicinity of the bar @xcite , indicating that the bar may be dynamically important , the hi maps of kim et al .",
    "show that the lmc bar does not dominate the central dynamics . from this",
    "we conclude that the mass of the bar can not exceed the disk mass in the central regions , which leads us to a bound on the bar mass .",
    "now , @xmath28 of the disk mass lies within one scale length , while most of the bar lies in this same central region .",
    "we thus arrive at the following restriction : @xmath29 to avoid bar domination .",
    "this agrees nicely with the estimates of sahu ( 1994b ) , who suggested a bar to disk mass ratio in the range 15 - 20% based on luminosity considerations .",
    "= 20.0 cm      now we turn to the velocity distribution of the model stars .",
    "perhaps the best determination of the inner velocity curve of the lmc is in the work of kim et al .",
    "when supplemented by outer rotation curves derived from carbon stars @xcite and clusters and planetary nebulae ( pne ) @xcite the basic outline is clear : the circular velocity rises rapidly in the first two kpc and then levels off and is flat at about 70 km / s out to at least 8 kpc .",
    "there are indications of a possible dip at 3 kpc though this may not be significant . for our models",
    "we approximate the rotation curve by solid body rotation out to a radius @xmath30  kpc , followed by flat rotation at @xmath31  km / s .",

    ". however , as gould ( 1995 ) has shown , velocity dispersions ( and the implied scale heights ) are crucial in determining the optical depth and rate of microlensing .",
    "so let us consider measurements of the velocity dispersion of lmc populations .",
    "prevot , rousseau & martin ( 1989 ) studied late - type supergiants and hii regions , concluding that the internal velocity dispersion of this population is approximately 6 km / s .",
    "this is quite close to that of the hi gas , 5.4 km / s ( hughes et al .",
    "1991 ) which is hardly surprising as these tracers all belong to a very young population .",
    "a somewhat older population is probably illustrated by the disk - like ( @xmath32 km / s ) ch stars found by cowley & hartwick ( 1991 ) which seem to correspond to `` ch - like '' stars found in the galactic disk @xcite .",
    "cowley & hartwick also found , however , a population with a considerably higher velocity dispersion ( 20 - 25 km / s ) , that presumably corresponds to an even older population .",
    "meatheringham et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , in a study of planetary nebulae ( pne ) , found that the intermediate population of stars represented by the pne are rotating as fast and in the same disk as the gas , but with a velocity dispersion of 19.1 km / s .",
    "bessel et  al .",
    "( 1986 ) observed old ( age @xmath33 yrs ) long period variables ( olpv s ) , which are thought to trace the oldest stellar populations , and obtained a mean line - of - sight velocity dispersion of about 30 km / s .",
    "hughes et al . ( 1991 ) also observed olpv s and obtained similar results ( @xmath34 km / s ) .",
    "we note here , for future reference , that a spheroidal distribution would require velocity dispersions of @xmath35 km / s .",
    "since the observed dispersions of the olpv s fall far short of this , we see that even this oldest population derives much of its support from rotation , and therefore exhibits `` disk - like '' kinematics .",
    "the general trend among the many kinematic studies of the lmc seems to be clear : tracers have velocity dispersions ranging from @xmath36 km / s for very young ages to @xmath37 km / s for the most ancient populations . _ all _ lmc populations studied to date have disk - like kinematics regardless of age @xcite .",
    "table  1 lists some of the more recent kinematic studies of the lmc by population type , velocity dispersion and probable age .    from the velocity dispersions ,",
    "let us now turn to the vertical scale heights .",
    "bessel et al .",
    "( 1986 ) estimated the vertical scale height of the oldest population to be roughly 0.3 kpc , while hughes et al .",
    "( 1991 ) estimated the scale height to be @xmath38 kpc .",
    "they emphasized that this was the oldest population , accounting for at most 2% of the mass of the lmc .",
    "the majority of the lmc disk , they contend , should possess a more compact vertical distribution and smaller vertical velocity dispersions .",
    "this is supported by rr lyrae and cluster studies which suggest that the ancient extended populations make up considerably less than 10% of the lmc stars @xcite .",
    "we thus allow our scale height ( which should characterize the bulk of the lmc population ) to range up to 0.5 kpc and adopt velocity dispersions in a corresponding range of 10 - 30 km / s .",
    "in theory these parameters should be tied together by the vertical jeans equation ( however see weinberg 1999 ) . in practice",
    ", our knowledge of the total mass and mass distribution of the lmc is poor enough that we simply note that the opposite extremes of these ranges ( i.e. 10 km / s with 0.5 kpc and 30 km / s with @xmath39 kpc ) are likely inconsistent .",
    "the above distributions describe the known stellar populations .",
    "we again reiterate that the non - detection of any stellar halo population ( @xmath40 km / s ) places severe constraints upon the existence of such a stellar halo .",
    "the above noted rr lyrae and cluster studies , along with the olpv observations limit the stellar halo to perhaps 5% of the mass of the lmc @xcite .",
    "this , however , places no limits upon the existence of a dark halo , to which we now turn .",
    "obviously , even less is known about the lmc dark matter than its luminous populations . as kim et al .",
    "( 1998 ) discuss , the observed lmc rotation curve is inconsistent with the distribution of known populations , given the assumption of a _ constant _ mass to light ratio .",
    "schommer et al .",
    "( 1992 ) obtain similar results .",
    "although the variation in the mass to light ratio required to explain the rotation curve with luminous matter alone is less than a factor of two , we can take these results as prima facie evidence for dark matter within the lmc .",
    "this should not be too surprising , since studies of the velocity curves of similar dwarf galaxies show that they are dominated by dark matter ( see e.g. carignan & purton 1998 ) .",
    "models without dark halo also exist that can explain the rotation curves ( d. alves 1999 , private communication ) , but these will not be discussed here .",
    "there are numerous models that have been used to describe dark matter in galaxies .",
    "most common , and perhaps easiest , is the simple spherical pseudo - isothermal distribution , @xmath41^{-1}\\ ] ] with core radius @xmath42 and central density @xmath43 . in the limit @xmath44 ,",
    "this distribution gives an isothermal maxwellian velocity profile @xcite .",
    "for the lmc , however , core radii smaller than @xmath45  kpc lead to problems matching the rotation curve .",
    "although not self - consistent , for simplicity we use @xmath46 kpc and a uniform maxwellian velocity distribution .",
    "we take the fraction of this halo in machos to be @xmath47 .",
    "since the lmc is embedded in the ( dominating ) gravitational potential of our galaxy , we expect the lmc to have a tidal radius , beyond which objects are not stably bound to the lmc @xcite .",
    "this places a limit on the size of the lmc halo .",
    "although the density should smoothly decline to zero near the tidal radius , for simplicity we instead implement a truncation radius , @xmath48 , beyond which the lmc halo density abruptly vanishes . using star counts from the 2mass survey , weinberg ( 1998 )",
    "has estimated @xmath49 kpc .",

    "the highest estimates are based of the spheroidal estimator of bahcall & tremaine ( 1981 ) , which assumes both velocity isotropy and a spherical mass distribution .",

    "the following we ignore this effect , simply noting that our quoted results are over - estimates .",
    "the second issue concerns the differing populations of the disk and bar .",
    "these different populations ( due to the varying ages and star formation history ) yield different source to mass ratios . unfortunately , with the present knowledge of the bar and disk luminosity functions and relative metallicities etc .",
    "a precise calculation is impossible .",
    "we therefore assume a uniform mass to source ratio .",
    "we have found it convenient to calculate the optical depth , event rate , and duration distribution using a monte carlo method .",
    "one advantage of the monte carlo technique is that it easily allows consideration of arbitrary spatial distributions of lenses and sources .",
    "another important advantage of the monte carlo method is the ease with which we were able to average over the experimental fields as discussed in the following section .",
    "in addition , the separate integrals for the optical depth , rate , and event timescales can all be evaluated simultaneously , in one fell swoop .      for self lensing models",
    "the optical depth varies rapidly with position in the lmc .",
    "thus a single number , `` the optical depth to the lmc '' is only useful if the precise location of the observed sources is specified . in order to make the comparison to the observed optical depth we have chosen to average our results over the macho collaboration fields @xcite .",
    "ideally we should fold in the experimental efficiency and relative source numbers in each field as observed . since these numbers are unavailable , however , we have weighted each field by the _ model _ number of stars .",

    "the solid outlines depict the 22 fields covering about 10 square degrees used in the macho year 2 analysis @xcite .",

    "the dotted outlines describe the roughly 40 square degrees ( 82 fields ) that are being monitored by the macho collaboration .",

    "later we will discuss possible observational consequences of the increased coverage .",
    "also of interest are the 30 fields that will be presented in the macho collaboration 5 year analysis @xcite .",
    "we note that the eros ii collaboration is similarly observing most of the lmc disk , while the ogle ii collaboration monitors 4.2 square degrees @xcite .",
    "although the optical depth is independent of the mass function , the event rate and the timescale distribution do depend upon the lens masses .",
    "we therefore must consider an appropriate mass function for the lensing population . as we expect the rate to be dominated by low mass stars , we choose to employ the mf derived by gould , bahcall & flynn ( 1997 ) , which they based upon counts of m dwarfs in the mw disk .",

    "thus , @xmath97 should capture the essential behavior of the 3-d averaged optical depth , with asymptotic leading behavior @xmath98 .",
    "for the lmc , @xmath99 , so we expect the expansion @xmath100 to describe accurately the scaling of the optical depth with the parameters over the range of interest , even if we keep only the first one or two terms",

    "we arrive at an interesting relation if we further approximate this already zeroth - order treatment .",

    "for example , the vertical scale height @xmath16 is typically computed using the jeans equations , which for a self - gravitating thin disk in equilibrium demand that @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the local surface density .",
    "inserting this into our scaling for @xmath92 gives @xmath109 this , of course , is gould s ( 1995 ) analytic result .",
    "gould s point is that for disk - disk lensing , to lowest order , the distance of the lmc and the total mass ( rotation curve ) are irrelevant ; that is , the only directly observed quantities that seem to matter are the velocity dispersion and axis ratio .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that this conclusion is predicated upon the validity of the self - gravitating , thin - disk , steady - state solutions to the jeans equations , which weinberg ( 1999 ) has argued may not be applicable to the lmc .",
    "we feel that it is better to base microlensing estimates upon parameters like the scale height , that are directly tied to the spatial density distribution , rather than quantities like the velocity dispersion , which require questionable assumptions .",

    "again , we may also be interested in these optical depths for different parameter values , so let s consider the scaling behavior of these integrals .",
    "now , we previously derived an approximate form by considering the limit of a compact source distribution and diffuse lens distribution .",

    "thus , @xmath92 scales roughly like @xmath121 now we turn to the cross terms ( disk - bar and bar - disk ) .",

    "this averaging is not completely trivial since the density of source stars is different in each population . to find an average optical depth for a set of model parameters and a set of observed fields , the optical depths for each population should be multiplied by the source density at each field location and then averaged with this weighting .",

    "unfortunately , the paucity of actual events may limit our ability to rule out models based upon the observed event distribution .",

    "indeed , the distribution of old clusters @xcite and the rr lyrae star counts @xcite are particularly telling as they are almost certainly an ancient population .",
    "the aubourg et al .",
    "model thus appears to be at odds with current observations of the lmc disk .",
    "additionally , it is unclear that the process they invoke for populating their spheroidal component , stochastic heating of the disk by inhomogeneities in the disk itself , would be capable of ejecting upwards of 80% of the lmc disk mass into a far less centrally concentrated pseudosphere .",
    "we can recast their model , however , in a potentially more palatable form .",
    "the machos conjectured to reside in the halo of _ our _ galaxy have mass of about 0.2 - 0.8 m@xmath167 , and are modeled in a spherical pseudoisothermal distribution .",

    "machos becomes a matter of semantics ; we see that the aubourg et al .",
    "model is identical in practice to a macho halo around the lmc .",
    "as expected , therefore , their results match our calculation for disk - halo lensing .",
    "very recently , weinberg ( 1999b ) has suggested that a substantial portion ( perhaps all ) of the lmc microlensing might be due to lmc disk self lensing .",
    "he models the lmc self - consistently with a sophisticated n - body code and finds that the effect of the time - varying galactic tidal forces is to puff up the lmc disk by a factor ( @xmath168 ) without noticeably increasing the velocity dispersion .",
    "this is important since the optical depth depends strongly on scale height . indeed ,",
    "if this simulation does in fact resemble the lmc s history , then it argues against reliance upon thin - disk equilibrium solutions to the jeans equations , _ a la _ gould ( 1995 ) .",
    "weinberg s reported optical depth is @xmath169 , which compares favorably with the recent estimates from the macho collaboration ( @xmath170 ) @xcite .",
    "a few points need to be made regarding this result .",
    "first , this optical depth appears to be calculated for the line of sight to the center of the lmc , instead of averaging over the observational fields .",
    "this will yield results biased upward by a factor of about 1.5 .",
    "second , weinberg assumes an inclination of 45@xmath171 .",
    "using the more likely preferred value of 30@xmath171 , yields a further 15% reduction ( see weinberg s figure 12 ) .",
    "finally , the disk mass taken in his study , @xmath172 appears unrealistically high . as discussed above , ( and matching nicely with weinberg s own calculations in his appendix a ) the _ disk _ mass is unlikely to be above @xmath173 . taking all of these adjustments into account the optical depth is reduced to @xmath174 , falling in line with the values calculated in this work .",
    "finally , we should note that zhao ( 1998 ) has suggested that an intervening dwarf galaxy similar to the sagittarius dwarf could be responsible for the lmc microlensing events .",
    "searches for the rr lyrae stars that should be contained in such a dwarf turned up negatively @xcite , but zaritsky & lin ( 1997 ) evaded these search limits by hypothesizing the existence of either a dwarf galaxy very near the lmc itself , or perhaps a tidal tail pulled from the lmc by a close encounter with the smc .",
    "they claimed detection of a population of stars from this intervening entity .",
    "this result has been disputed in several ways by several groups .",
    "gould ( 1998 ) and bennett ( 1998 ) claim that the optical depth due to the zaritsky & lin population is insufficient to explain the microlensing results .",
    "beaulieu & sackett ( 1998 ) claim that the zaritsky & lin stars are ordinary lmc stars that are brighter due to stellar evolution , and thus do not represent an intervening population .",
    "the discussion continues @xcite , and at this point , while the question has not been definitively settled , the case for an intervening dwarf looks rather weak .",
    "we have seen that pure lmc disk / bar self - lensing models appear incapable of producing the measured optical depth of @xmath175 . given the current state of observations of the lmc , the most likely self - lensing optical depth is an order of magnitude too small to account for the observed events .",
    "a reasonable range of self lensing optical depths is 0.47 - 7.84@xmath134 depending upon model parameters .",
    "we have shown that halo models can reproduce the optical depth , _ if _ we are allowed to push the model s parameters to their extremes .",
    "we pointed out that numerous observations already limit our ability to push the parameters very far . in order to invoke a self - lensing explanation of lmc microlensing , observation of a sufficient number of stars exhibiting the characteristics of",
    "an extended halo seems crucial .",
    "better observations of the lmc that more strongly constrain the disk scale height , inclination , disk mass , total mass , and velocity dispersion also are important as they will reduce the allowed range of optical depth .",
    "especially important are measurements of velocity dispersions and spatial extent of old populations such as rr lyrae .",
    "we then discussed how consideration of the distribution of optical depth over the face of the lmc can help further distinguish between models .",
    "in particular , lmc disk / bar lensing will produce events clustered around the lmc center , while lmc halo lensing will produce a more diffuse distribution of events .",
    "we introduced a new clustering statistic , and showed that more microlensing observations distributed over the face of the lmc can be very useful in identifying lmc disk / bar self lensing .",
    "however , distinguishing between an lmc halo and the milky way halo will probably not be possible using this method .",
    "finally , we note that if the distance of some of the lenses could be directly determined , the puzzle could be solved .",
    "there are several ways to do this using microlensing fine - structure , and the distance to at least one binary smc lens has been well determined @xcite .",
    "one lmc binary lens ( lmc-9 ) for which such a determination was possible was unfortunately not sampled well enough to allow a secure distance determination @xcite , but continued monitoring should eventually allow some distances to be found .",
    "perhaps the most secure distance determination would come from astrometric parallax effects in microlensing .",
    "nasa s space interferometry mission ( sim ) , scheduled for launch about 2005 , should have the astrometric resolution to make definitive parallax measurements @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that the smc events along with lmc-9 strongly support the notion that all of the events are due to self - lensing . in this view , the next lmc binary event should definitively decide between halo and self lensing scenarios .",
    "this may not be the case .",
    "first , the smc is _ expected _ to have a high self - lensing rate regardless of the nature of the lmc lenses . coupled with the uncertain interpretation of lmc-9 , the case for lmc self lensing",
    "is poorly supported at present . in this light , the next lmc binary event alone will probably not suffice to locate the bulk of the lenses , even if it is found to be an lmc lens .",
    "first , we ve seen that lmc self lensing may well contribute of order 10 - 20% of the lensing , so that some self - lensing events are expected .",
    "secondly , there may well be fewer binaries in the halo than the lmc , inducing a possible selection effect in favor of lmc lenses .",
    "it will probably require multiple future distance determinations to settle this matter .",
    "given the importance of the lmc microlensing interpretation to the dark matter question , many of the potential observational efforts described above are being attempted .",
    "we are hopeful that the interpretation of lmc microlensing will become clear within the next few years .",

    "<S> one of these proposed explanations , lmc self - lensing , which invokes ordinary lmc stars as the long sought - after lenses , has recently gained considerable popularity as a possible solution to the microlensing conundrum . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we carefully examine the set of lmc self - lensing models . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , we review the pertinent observations made of the lmc , and show how these observations place limits on such self - lensing models . we find that , given current observational constraints , _ no _ purely lmc disk models are capable of producing optical depths as large as that reported in the macho collaboration 2-year analysis . besides pure disk </S>",
    "<S> , we also consider alternate geometries , and present a framework which encompasses the previous studies of lmc self - lensing . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss which model parameters need to be pushed in order for such models to succeed . </S>",
    "<S> for example , like previous workers , we find that an lmc halo geometry may be able to explain the observed events . however , since _ all _ known lmc tracer stellar populations exhibit disk - like kinematics , such models will have difficulty being reconciled with observations . for </S>",
    "<S> smc self - lensing , we find predicted optical depths differing from previous results , but more than sufficient to explain all observed smc microlensing . in contrast , for the lmc we find a self - lensing optical depth contribution between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , with @xmath2 being the value for the set of lmc parameters most consistent with current observations .    </S>",
