    "a stochastic background of gravitational waves ( gws ) is expected to arise as a super - position of a large number of unresolved sources , from different directions in the sky , and with different polarizations .",
    "it is usually described in terms of the gw spectrum , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the energy density of gws in the frequency range @xmath2 to @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the critical energy density of the universe .",
    "stochastic backgrounds of gws are interesting to investigate because they ( i ) represent a foreground signal for the detection of primordial backgrounds ( see the contribution of m. maggiore in this conference ) , and ( ii ) provide important information on gw sources and on the properties of distant stellar populations .",
    "the starting point in any calculation of the gw backgrounds produced by extragalactic sources is the redshift evolution of the comoving star formation rate density .",
    "this is generally inferred from observations which have been recently extended out to redshifts @xmath5 following the analysis of the deepest near - infrared image ever obtained on the hubble ultra deep field using the new / ir camera on hst ( bouwens et al .",
    "the detection of galaxies at @xmath6 , just 500 - 600 myr after recombination and in the heart of the reionization epoch , provides clues about galaxy build - up at a time that must have been as little as 200 - 300 myr since the first substantial star formation ( at @xmath7 ) .",
    "the existence of galaxies at @xmath5 shows that galaxy formation was well underway at this very early epoch .",
    "the most interesting astrophysical sources of gravitational radiation such as the core - collapse of a massive star to a black hole , the instabilities of a rapidly rotating neutron star or the inspiral and coalescence of a compact binary system are all related to the ultimate stages of stellar evolution . thus , the rate of formation of these stellar remnants can be deduced from the rate of formation of the corresponding stellar progenitors once a series of assumptions are made regarding the stellar evolutionary track followed .",
    "a few years ago we have published estimates of the stochastic backgrounds produced by astrophysical sources , concentrating in particular on the ( i ) gravitational collapse of a massive star that leads to the formation of a black hole ( ferrari , matarrese & schneider 1999a ) , ( ii ) the emission of gws by newly born rapidly rotating neutron stars ( ferrari , matarrese & schneider 1999b ) , ( iii ) gravitational collapse of a super - massive star to black hole ( schneider et al . 2000 ) , ( iv ) the orbital decay of various degenerate binary systems that loose angular momentum as a consequence of the emission of gravitational radiation ( schneider et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "while to compute the first two classes of backgrounds we could simply derive the black holes and neutron stars formation rate as a function of redshift from the corresponding star formation rate ( estimated from observational data ) via an assumed stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , the last two classes required additional information from theoretical models for the evolution of primordial objects ( vmbhs ) , and from a binary population synthesis model ( compact binaries ) .",
    "we refer the interested reader to the original papers for further details .",
    "the resulting gw backgrounds are presented in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : gwback ] . in the right panel of the same figure",
    ", we also show a collection of signals predicted by additional studies on double compact stellar binaries ( farmer & phinney 2003 ; regimbau & chauvineau 2007 ) , on the collapse of population ii and iii stars ( buonanno et al . 2005 ) , on strongly magnetized neutron stars ( regimbau & de freitas pacheco 2006 ) , and on very massive black hole binary systems ( sesana , vecchio & colacino 2008 ) .",
    "shaded regions illustrate the sensitivity of the corresponding signal to variations of critical parameters .",
    "our present understanding of pop  iii star formation suggests that these stars are not necessarily confined to form in the first dark matter halos at redshift @xmath8 but may continue to form during cosmic evolution in regions of sufficiently low metallicity , with @xmath9 . at these low metallicities ,",
    "the reduced cooling efficiency and large accretion rates favor the formation of massive stars , with characteristic masses @xmath10 ( bromm et al .",
    "2001 ; schneider et al .",
    "2002 , 2006a ; omukai et al .",
    "2005 ) . with the exception of the dynamical range @xmath11 , where they are expected to explode as pair - instability sne ( heger & woosley 2002 )",
    ", these stars are predicted to collapse to black holes of comparable masses and thus to be efficient sources of gws .",
    "earlier estimates of the extragalactic background generated by the collapse of the first stars , discussed in the previous section , were limited by our poor understanding of their characteristic masses and formation rates .",
    "in particular , the pop  iii star formation rate and the cosmic transition between pop  iii and pop  ii stars is regulated by the rate at which metals are formed and mixed in the gas surrounding the first star forming regions , a mechanism that we generally refer to as chemical feedback .",
    "semi - analytic studies which implement chemical feedback generally find that , due to inhomogeneous metal enrichment , the transition is extended in time , with coeval epochs of pop  iii and pop  ii star formation , and that pop  iii stars can continue to form down to moderate redshifts , @xmath12 ( scannapieco , schneider & ferrara 2003 ; schneider et al .",
    "2006b ) . to better assess the validity of these semi - analytic models , tornatore , ferrara & schneider ( 2007 ) have performed a set of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with an improved treatment of chemical enrichment . in the simulation , it is possible to assign a metallicity - dependent stellar imf . when @xmath13 pop  ii stars are assumed to form according to a salpeter imf @xmath14 with @xmath15 and lower ( upper ) mass limit of @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "stars with masses in the @xmath18 range explode as type - ii sne and the explosion energy and metallicity - dependent metal yields are taken from woosley & weaver ( 1985 ) .",
    "stars with masses @xmath19 do not contribute to metal enrichment as they are assumed to directly collapse to black holes .",
    "very massive pop  iii stars form in regions where @xmath20 ; since theoretical models do not yet provide any indication on the shape of the pop  iii imf , tornatore et al .",
    "( 2007 ) adopt a salpeter imf shifted to the mass range @xmath21 ; only stars in the pair - instability range ( @xmath22 ) contribute to metal - enrichment and the metal yields and explosion energies are taken from heger & woosley ( 2002 ) .",
    "the simulation allows to follow metal enrichment properly accounting for the finite stellar lifetimes of stars of different masses , the change of the stellar imf and metal yields .",
    "the numerical schemes adopted to simulate metal transport ad diffusion are discussed in tornatore et al .",

    "the critical metallicity which defines the pop  iii / pop  ii transition is taken to be @xmath25 , at the upper limit of the allowed range .",
    "however , additional runs show that decreasing the critical metallicity to @xmath26 reduces the pop  iii star formation rate by a factor @xmath27 .",
    "it is clear from the figure that pop  ii stars always dominate the cosmic star formation rate ; however , in agreement with previous semi - analytic studies , the simulation shows that pop  iii stars continue to form down to @xmath12 , although with a decreasing rate . over cosmic history ,",
    "the fraction of baryons processed by pop  iii stars is predicted to be @xmath28 .          the first class of sources we have considered",

    "these are predominantly g - modes oscillations , which are excited hundreds of milliseconds after bounce by turbulence and by accretion downstreams from the sn shock ( undergoing the standing - accretion - shock - instability , sasi ) , and typically last for several hundred milliseconds . in this phase a strong gw emission has been shown to occur , with a corresponding energy ranging from @xmath34 for a 11 @xmath30 progenitor , to @xmath35 for a 25 @xmath30 progenitor . in the latter case ,",

    "[ fig : gwback_new ] , we have applied to the same signals the so - called zero - frequency limit : in fact , current numerical simulations describe the source collapse at most for a few seconds , and can not predict the emission below a fraction of hz .",

    "thus , the pop  iii / ii signals dominate over the primordial background only for frequencies @xmath66  hz . even below this frequency range , however , it may be possible to discriminate the astrophysical backgrounds from dominant instrumental noise or from primordial signals exploiting the non - gaussian ( shot - noise ) structure of the former , which are characterized by duty - cycles of the order of @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) for pop  ii ( pop  iii ) sources ( see marassi et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "in particular seto ( 2008 ) has proposed a method to check if the detected gwb is an inflation - type background or if it is contaminated by undetectable weak burst signals from pop  iii / pop  ii collapse .",
