    "polyelectrolyte stars ( pe s ) are complex macromolecules that have attracted a lot of interest in the recent past .",
    "they consist of @xmath0 polymer chains , all attached on a common centre , and carrying ionizable groups along their backbones .",
    "solution of these molecules in a polar solvent results into dissociation of the groups , so that the chains turn into polyelectrolytes and stretch considerably with respect to their neutral conformations .",
    "already in the early 1990s , the importance of the stretched pe - chains in stabilizing colloidal suspensions has been pointed out and analysed theoretically by pincus @xcite employing scaling theory as well as , more recently , by wang and denton @xcite using linear - response theory .",
    "a distinguishing feature of pe - stars is their ability to adsorb the vast majority of the released counterions into their interior , creating thereby an inhomogeneous cloud of entropically trapped particles that provides a strong entropic barrier against coagulation @xcite .",
    "the development of accurate effective interactions between the pe - stars @xcite has led to predictions regarding their overall phase behaviour with emphasis on crystallization @xcite , which has recently received experimental corroboration @xcite .",
    "though a great deal has thus been learned regarding the behaviour of one - component solutions of pe - stars , the question of the influence of these ultrasoft colloids on solutions of hard colloids has not been investigated thus far . at the same time , the behaviour of pe - stars in the vicinity of planar or curved hard surfaces ( such as a larger colloidal particle ) is an issue of considerable interest , due to the possibility of manipulating the conformation of the pe - star by suitably changing the surface s geometry or physical characteristics @xcite .",
    "recently , the properties of pe - stars close to hard , planar walls were investigated in detail by means of computer simulations and theory @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the geometrical constraint of the planar wall does not affect the ability of the pe - stars to absorb the vast majority of their counterions .",
    "in addition , a new mechanism giving rise to a wall - star repulsion has been discovered , which rests on compression of stiff star chains against the neighboring wall . in this work ,",
    "we proceed to the full , many body problem of a collection of pe - stars and neutral colloids , which can be seen as curved walls . basing on the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , we investigate the structure of the mixture and find that it is unstable against demixing as the concentration becomes sufficiently high .",
    "this work serves , thereby , as the reference point for future investigations on the effects of adding charge to the colloidal particles .",
    "it is specular to recently published work on mixtures of _ charged _ colloids with _",
    "polymers @xcite , since in our case the colloids are neutral and the ( star - branched ) polymers are charged .",
    "the rest of this paper is organised as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : eff_pot ] we introduce the colloid  colloid and pe - star  pe - star effective interactions and we derive the cross interaction , based on previous results on the pe - star interaction potential with a planar wall . in sec .",

    "the mixture contains , thus , @xmath1 spherical , neutral colloids with diameter @xmath2 ( radius @xmath3 and @xmath4 pe - stars in aqueous solution .",
    "the stars can be characterised by their degree of polymerization @xmath5 , functionality @xmath0 , and charging fraction @xmath6 . thereby",
    ", the @xmath0 chains of each star are charged in a periodical manner in such a way that every ( @xmath7)-th monomer carries a charge @xmath8 . as a result ,",
    "every star carries a total bare charge @xmath9 , leaving behind @xmath10 monovalent , oppositely charged counterions in the mixture due to the requirement that the system must remain electro - neutral as a whole . with @xmath11 referring to the stars diameter , i.e. , twice the average centre - to - end distance @xmath12 of the arms , we define the size ratio @xmath13 between the two species as @xmath14 within this work , we will only consider pe - stars that are smaller than the colloids , hence @xmath15 . the degree of polymerization of every arm , @xmath5 , and the charging ratio @xmath6 play a crucial role because they determine the number of released counterions @xmath16 mentioned above .",
    "the latter are , in turn , mainly responsible for the emergence of the star - star @xcite and the star - colloid effective repulsions @xcite , due to the loss of entropy they experience when two such objects approach close to each other , see also eq .",

    "the thermodynamic parameters are the partial number densities @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) of the respective species and the absolute temperature @xmath21 .",

    "the starting point for all considerations to follow are the effective pair potentials between the constituent mesoscopic particles , having integrated out all the monomer , solvent and counterions degrees of freedom . when introducing this set of interactions as an input quantity into the full two - component integral equation theory described in more detail in sec .",

    "they employed monomer - resolved molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations and analytical theories and found an ultra - soft , bounded , density - dependent effective interaction governed by the entropic repulsions of counterions trapped in the interior of the stars .",

    "thus , we fix @xmath38 to the value measured in md simulations made during the investigation of pe - stars in planar confinement @xcite .",

    "neither the py nor the hnc closure are thermodynamically consistent , however , and in our case this is a crucial factor , since we are interested in the calculation of phase boundaries , which should not depend on the route chosen to calculate the free energies .",

    "in particular , it grows upon addition of stars to the system and such behaviour could in case of distinctly high and broad maxima in principle lead to micro - phase separation , i.e. , cluster formation @xcite .",
    "but for the physical system we examine and the range of parameters we investigate , the barrier remains anyway rather low and narrow .",
    "micro - phase separation is therefore not likely to happen . instead , the type of effective colloid ",

    "<S> the effective interactions are based on a derjaguin - like approximation , which is based on previously derived potentials acting between polyelectrolyte stars and planar walls . on the basis of these interactions we subsequently calculate the demixing binodals of the binary colloid  </S>",

    "<S> the system becomes more unstable with respect to demixing as the star functionality and the size ratio grow . </S>"
