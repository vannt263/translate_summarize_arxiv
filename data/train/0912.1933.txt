    "@xcite , it was suggested that the nontrivial topological charge of qcd vacuum , @xmath2 can be probed by measuring asymmetric electric currents , due to an event - by - event @xmath9- and @xmath10-violation , in the non - central heavy - ion collision experiments such as rhic , fair , and lhc .",
    "their main idea is that unequal numbers of the chirally left- and right - handed quarks , @xmath11 proportional to the @xmath2 in terms of the axial ward - takahashi identity  @xcite , can produce the asymmetric electric current under a strong magnetic field @xmath12 . interestingly enough , a possible experimental evidence was already reported by star collaboration at rhic  @xcite .",
