    "one of the most important discoveries by the  observatory was the ubiquity of x - ray coronae of early - type galaxies in the field and poor environments ( forman , jones & tucker 1985 ) .",
    "this discovery changed our view of early - type galaxies : they are gas - rich instead of gas - poor , but the gas is in the x - ray phase with a temperature of @xmath14 k. the consensus is that the x - ray gas of early - type galaxies originates as the stellar mass lost from evolved stars and planetary nebulae , accumulating in the galaxy without much escaping via galactic winds ( e.g. , mathews 1990 ) .",
    "their origin is different from that of the cluster icm , which should be mostly primordial .",
    "the gas ejected from evolved stars collides and passes through shocks .",
    "the gas temperature has been raised to the stellar kinetic temperature determined by the stellar velocity dispersion , and may further be raised by heating from supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "however , it has been known that the kinetic energy of sne is not efficiently dissipated into the hot ism gas , especially for less massive galaxies with shallow potentials , so galactic winds can form in less massive galaxies and make them x - ray faint ( mathews & baker 1971 ; david , forman & jones 1991 ; brown & bregman 1998 ) .",
    "galactic cooling cores have generally formed in massive galaxies with deep potentials .",
    "cooling of the x - ray coronal gas indeed happens in at least some galaxies ( e.g. , the o vi detections by _ fuse _ , bregman et al . 2005 ) .",
    "it has been long known that the x - ray luminosities ( @xmath15 ) of coronae correlates with the optical @xmath16 band luminosities ( @xmath17 ) of their host galaxies , but the dispersion is large ( forman et al .",
    "1985 ; canizares , fabbiano & trinchieri 1987 ; brown & bregman 1998 ; osullivan et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the large dispersion has been a puzzle for almost two decades .",
    "the narrow color - magnitude relation and the narrow fundamental plane of early - type galaxies imply that local early - type galaxies are a homogeneous group . nevertheless , early - type galaxies are not a one - parameter class , and the x - ray luminosity of coronae is also affected by properties besides the optical luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "various factors have been proposed to explain the dispersion of the @xmath15 - @xmath17 relation for the x - ray coronae of early - type galaxies , including sn rate , galactic rotation , metallicity , dark matter halo and environments ( see a review by mathews & brighenti 2003 and the references therein ) .",
    "however , no extra parameter has been found to significantly tighten the correlation , and no single scenario seems to be able to explain the large dispersion .",
    "it is likely that both internal effects ( e.g. , sn rate & dark matter halo ) and external effects ( environment ) contribute to the dispersion .    limited by its angular resolution ( 30@xmath18 ) ,",
    "the x - ray coronae detected by  are almost all in the field , or poor environments , or cool clusters ( e.g. , virgo ) .",
    "there were some attempts to study x - ray coronae of galaxies in hot clusters with the and  data ( e.g. , canizares & blizzard 1991 for coma ; dow & white 1995 for coma ; sakelliou & merrifield 1998 for a2634 ) , but the results were generally non - detections or inconclusive .",
    "furthermore , the  results on galaxy coronae suffer greatly from the contamination by agn , x - ray binaries and icm emission . prior to the launch of , no 10@xmath19",
    "k galaxy coronae ( not including cluster cooling cores ) were firmly detected in hot ( @xmath20 10@xmath8 k ) clusters , nor were they expected , since evaporation and ram - pressure stripping by the hot , dense icm should very efficiently remove gas from galaxies . the first direct evidence for the survival of galaxy coronae in hot clusters came from the  observations of the coma cluster .",
    "vikhlinin et al .",
    "( 2001 , v01 hereafter ) found small , but extended ( @xmath13 2 kpc in radius ) , x - ray coronae ( @xmath21 1 - 2 kev ) in the cores of the two dominant coma galaxies , ngc 4874 and ngc 4889 , where the surrounding icm has a temperature of 8 - 9 kev .",
    "more and more similar embedded coronae have been found since then . at present , eight more coronae , small but spatially resolved , were unambiguously revealed by  in hot clusters ( @xmath3 3 kev ) and investigated in detail : two lie in the 3.2 kev cluster a1060 ( yamasaki et al .",
    "2002 ) , four in a 5 - 6 kev region of a1367 ( sun et al .",
    "2005 , hereafter s05 ) , one in a 6 - 7 kev region of perseus ( sun , jerius & jones 2005 , hereafter sjj05 ) , and one associated with the cd galaxy of the 4 kev cluster a2670 ( fujita , sarazin & sivakoff 2006 ) . thermal emission from cluster galaxies was also detected in several other cases ( e.g. , smith 2003 ; hardcastle , sakelliou & worrall 2005 ) , although detailed analysis was not done because the x - ray sources are either unresolved or faint . among all these detections ,",
    "the corona associated with ngc  1265 , the prototype of narrow - angle tail ( nat ) radio galaxies in perseus , is the most interesting one , as its corona survives gas stripping despite motion with a mach number of @xmath13 3 , icm evaporation ( @xmath22 10 ) , fast cooling ( @xmath23 30 myr at the center ) and powerful agn outbursts .",
    "these galaxy coronae ( @xmath21 1 kev ) in rich environments ( high ambient pressure ) are pressure confined and small ( 1.5 - 4.5 kpc , or 3 - 10@xmath18 in radius at the distance of the coma cluster ) and require the superior  angular resolution to resolve them .",
    "these small coronae should form before their host galaxies began to evolve in hot clusters .",
    "if they were once destroyed in hot clusters , the hot icm should have filled the interstellar space .",
    "it is then difficult for galactic cooling cores to re - form against strong stripping and evaporation .",
    "these embedded galaxy coronae are perfect targets to study the gas physics and microscopic transport processes involved in the icm - corona interaction .",
    "gas stripping and evaporation by the surrounding hot dense icm should be very efficient to destroy coronae .",
    "however , v01 pointed out that the survival of two cool coronae in coma requires that heat conduction must be suppressed by a factor of 30 - 100 at the ism - icm boundary .",
    "s05 and sjj05 derived similar conclusions and the results also require viscosity to be suppressed .",
    "the galactic magnetic field should be responsible for the suppression , and so a better understanding of the galactic magnetic field evolution in rich environments is required .",
    "we shall emphasize that these embedded coronae in hot clusters are generally smaller than the mean free path of particles in the icm without magnetic field , which is :    @xmath24    therefore , it is questionable whether we can apply hydrodynamics to the icm flow around the embedded coronae .",
    "the distribution function may not be maxwellian so ideally kinetic theory or at least rarefied gas dynamics should be applied .",
    "this situation is different from coronae in cool groups ( e.g. , ngc  1404 in fornax , machacek et al . 2005 ) , where @xmath25 is generally smaller than 1 kpc while coronae are larger ( e.g. , @xmath13 9 kpc for ngc  1404 ) .",
    "the inclusion of magnetic field in the icm may further complicates the problem , by making transport processes anisotropic .",
    "the details are certainly complicated , largely depending on the magnetic field configuration and evolution .",
    "we notice that simulations of the evolution of x - ray coronae in clusters and groups all use hydrodynamics ( e.g. , toniazzo & schindler 2001 ) , while the detailed transport processes involving in the corona - icm interaction were not incorporated .",
    "s05 and sjj05 also showed that many host galaxies of coronae are active in radio and sometimes are luminous ( e.g. , ngc  1265 ) .",
    "the radio emission generally `` turns on '' after traversing the dense coronae ( i.e. morphologically anti - correlated , e.g. , ngc  3842 , ngc  4874 and ngc  1265 ) . in ngc  1265 ,",
    "since the jet power is so strong ( @xmath3 1000 times the thermal energy of the corona ) , the narrow jets must carry nearly all their energy away from the central smbh and release the energy outside the corona to preserve the small corona .",
    "thus , this fact implies that agn heating may not always be able to heat the central few kiloparsecs of a cooling core significantly . for ngc  1265",
    ", we also found that the bondi accretion luminosity of the detected coronal gas is similar to the jet power .",
    "as the inner @xmath13 2 kpc dense core of the corona can survive both high - speed stripping and powerful agn feedback , the cooling of coronae can fuel the central smbh in rich environments where the amount of cold galactic gas is at a minimum .",
    "these embedded coronae are also ideal targets to examine the effects of hot cluster environments on the properties of coronae ( e.g. , the @xmath26 relation , the size and x - ray gas mass of coronae ) , especially through a comparison with a sample of coronae in the field or poor environments",
    ". these cool coronae may also be seeds for future cluster cooling cores .",
    "motl et al .",
    "( 2004 ) presented a scenario for the formation of cluster cooling cores via hierarchical mergers .",
    "although the cool cores in their simulations are larger than what we observed , it is interesting to explore the evolution of these coronae and their frequency in clusters , and to further compare with simulations . in principle , the properties of the coronae also shed light on the evolution of their early - type host galaxies , as the evolution processes ( e.g. , mergers ) can easily impact the small coronae .",
    "compared to the x - ray coronae of early - type galaxies , we know even less about the x - ray coronae of late - type galaxies in hot clusters .",
    "one of the first detailed studies with  or  is ugc  6697 in a1367 ( sun & vikhlinin 2005 ) .",
    "we suggested that the starburst in ugc  6697 was triggered by the interaction with the icm . during the course of this project",
    ", we have found a spectacular x - ray tail behind a small starburst galaxy eso  137 - 001 ( sfr @xmath13 10 m@xmath9 / yr ) near the center of a massive cluster a3627 ( sun et al .",
    "the x - ray tail is long ( 70 kpc ) with a length - to - width ratio of @xmath13 10 .",
    "we interpret this tail as the stripped ism of eso 137 - 001 mixed with the hot cluster medium , with this blue galaxy being converted into a gas - poor galaxy .",
    "these remarkable examples of coronae in early - type and late - type galaxies are important to understand the galactic ism in hot clusters .",
    "however , the results based on just a few detections can be biased .",
    "we do not know how common the embedded coronae are .",
    "we know nothing about the properties of the whole population ( e.g. , luminosity , temperature , size and gas mass ) .",
    "what are the environmental effects on the properties of embedded coronae ?",
    "what processes mediate the energy balance and transfer inside coronae ? what is the general connection between coronae and the agn activity of their host galaxies . only a systematic analysis based on a well - selected sample",
    "can answer these questions and characterize the general properties of the whole population . only with the knowledge of the whole population ,",
    "can we better understand the results from detailed investigations of individual coronae . in this paper , we present the first systematic study of x - ray coronae of cluster galaxies , in 25 nearby ( @xmath1 0.05 ) , hot ( @xmath0 3 kev ) clusters using archival  data .",
    "the cluster and galaxy samples are defined in @xmath272 .",
    "the data analysis is summarized in @xmath273 .",
    "the properties of the corona population are present in @xmath274 ( for early - type galaxies ) and @xmath275 ( for late - type galaxies ) .",
    "we summarize the fraction of luminous x - ray agn in our sample in @xmath276 .",
    "@xmath277 is the discussion , while @xmath278 is the conclusions .",
    "notes of interesting coronae and galaxies in the sample are present in the appendix .",
    "the cluster sample is drawn from the  archive ( as of march , 2006 ) .",
    "we limit our investigation to nearby ( @xmath1 0.05 ) hot clusters to better resolve embedded coronae and to detect faint coronae ( @xmath28 10@xmath29 ergs s@xmath6 ) .",
    "clusters are selected with the following criteria : 1 ) @xmath30 3 kev ( from the x - ray galaxy clusters database , bax ) ; 2 ) @xmath1 0.05 ; 3 ) combined exposure time of @xmath3 10 ks for @xmath310.035 clusters , and @xmath3 20 ks for 0.035@xmath320.05 clusters ; 4 ) at least one known cluster member listed in the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) , excluding the cd if it is located in a dense cluster cooling core .",
    "there are 24 clusters fulfilling these criteria and all are included in the sample .",
    "as there are only 6 clusters hotter than 5 kev in these 24 clusters ( including all known @xmath3 5 kev clusters within @xmath33 of 0.035 ) , we lower the threshold on exposure time to 14 ksec to add another hot cluster a3558 ( @xmath2=5.4 kev ) .",
    "as the detection limits on coronae depend on the  exposure , the distance of the cluster , the surrounding icm background , the position of the galaxy in the detector and the galactic absorption , the resulting sensitivities are not uniform even in the same cluster but generally sufficient to detect x - ray coronae of @xmath10 2@xmath34 ergs s@xmath6 ( 0.5 - 2 kev ) .",
    "the sample includes 68  pointings with a total exposure of 2.77 ms and covers a total sky area of 3.3 deg@xmath35 .",

    "the clusters in the sample also span a wide range of evolutionary stages , from dynamically young merging clusters ( e.g. , a1367 , zw  1615 + 35 and a3627 ) to cooling core clusters ( e.g. , centaurus , perseus and a496 ) .",
    "the cluster distances are derived from their redshift ( from ned ) , assuming h@xmath36 = 70 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 , @xmath37@xmath38=0.3 , and @xmath39=0.7 ( table 1 ) .",
    "we mainly select galaxies by their near infrared ( nir ) @xmath40 band luminosities , as @xmath40 band light is a more reliable measure of the stellar mass and is little affected by extinction",
    ". moreover , the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) measures the nir photometry of cluster galaxies homogeneously .",
    "as concluded in s05 , massive galaxies , more likely to have galactic cooling cores , are much more likely to maintain their coronae in rich environments . in this work",

    "all cluster galaxies more luminous than this threshold have been included in the sample if they lie completely in the  fields .",

    "2002 ) , by assuming a @xmath45 color index of 3.7 ( jarrett 2000 ) and @xmath46 = 5.47 , @xmath47 = 3.39 . at @xmath33=0.05 , this threshold corresponds to 12.8 mag , well within the 2mass limit magnitude of 13.5 mag .",
    "we have also confirmed that galaxies more luminous than @xmath42 in the  field have been well covered by previous redshift surveys , except for galaxies in the 3c129.1 cluster that is behind the galactic plane .",

    "we restrict our analysis to @xmath3 2  galaxies because of the short exposure time .",

    "all observations were performed with the  advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) .",
    "standard data analysis was performed which includes the corrections for the slow gain change and charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) .",
    "we examined data from all acis chips except for chips i0 , i1 , s1 and s5 when acis - s was at the focus , since these chips lie sufficiently far from the optical axis that the detection limits are high .",
    "we investigated the light curve of source - free regions to exclude time intervals with strong background flares .",
    "as the local background is used for the analysis of small coronal sources , any weak background flares do not affect our analysis , which we have verified from the analysis of a sub - sample of embedded coronae .",

    ", we used the appropriate background files , and excluded weak background flares .",
    "we corrected for the acis low energy quantum efficiency ( qe ) degradation due to the contamination on acis s optical blocking filter , which increases with time and is positionally dependent .",
    "the calibration files used correspond to  calibration database 3.2.1 from the  x - ray center , released on december 2005 . in the spectral analysis , a lower energy cut of 0.5 kev is used to minimize the effects of calibration uncertainties at low energy .",

    "we also selected @xmath54 galaxies ( or @xmath55  in the @xmath16 band for late - type galaxies ) with soft x - ray ( 0.5 - 2 kev ) detections .",
    "this initial selection was not performed by examining the spatial extent of the x - ray sources , as small coronae are point - like at large ( e.g. , @xmath56 ) off - axis angle . moreover",
    ", the integrated lmxb emission from nearby galaxies may also appear extended .",
    "the soft x - ray detections come from the wavelet source detection tool in ciao ( wavdetect ) .",
    "any soft x - ray sources within 2@xmath18 of the nucleus of a known cluster galaxy at a significance level of @xmath10 3 @xmath53 are selected .",
    "therefore , we have a list of 160 @xmath52 cluster galaxies ( or @xmath3  in the @xmath16 band for late - type galaxies ) in the  field , plus all @xmath54 cluster galaxies ( or @xmath55  in the @xmath16 band for late - type galaxies ) with soft x - ray detections ( 59 sources in total ) . among these 160 sources ,",
    "101 have soft x - ray detections .",
    "embedded coronae will be identified from these 160 sources ( 101 + 59 ) in the following spatial and spectral analysis .      the most unambiguous evidence for the existence of 0.5 - 2 kev thermal gas is the iron l - shell hump centered at 0.8 - 1 kev , which makes the spectra of coronae significantly different from those of agn with a featureless power law or integrated emission of lmxb with a 5 - 10 kev bremsstrahlung .",
    "when x - ray sources are close to the optical axis , coronae can also be identified by their spatial extents .",
    "therefore , either of these two criteria can be used to robustly identify thermal coronae :    * a significant iron l - shell hump in the spectrum and a poor fit to a power law * extended soft x - ray sources    while the iron l - shell hump is very significant in the spectra of bright coronae like those associated with two coma central galaxies ( v01 ) and two bright galaxies in a1367 ( s05 ) , an objective measure is required to address the significance of the iron l - shell hump presented in fainter coronae and the departure of the fit from a power law .",
    "we identify a significant iron l - shell hump in a spectrum in the following objective way .",
    "the x - ray spectrum was first fitted by a power law , which fits the hard spectra of both agn and lmxb . then a mekal component with an abundance fixed at 0.8 solar ( the average abundance of coronae , see @xmath274.7 )",
    "is added to examine the improvement of the fit .",
    "traditionally , the f - test has been widely used to address the significance of an extra spectral component .",
    "however , protassov et al . (",
    "2002 ) has warned against the use of f - test on testing a hypothesis that is on the boundary of the parameter space , e.g. , presence of an emission line in the spectrum .",
    "although our test is for the presence of a wide iron l - shell hump , we did not use the f - test but instead performed monte carlo simulations to each spectrum to test the significance of the iron l - shell hump ( as recommended by protassov et al .",
    "similar methods have already been widely used in x - ray spectral analysis , mostly on the test of iron k emission or absorption lines ( e.g. , markowitz et al .",
    "the best - fit absorbed power law model was taken as the null hypothesis model .",
    "we used `` fakeit '' in xspec to simulate 3000 different fake spectra according to the null hypothesis model . the same response and background files , as well as the exposure time , have been used .",
    "the simulated spectra have been binned in the same way as that used to bin the real data .",
    "we fit each binned fake spectrum with the null hypothesis model ( an absorbed power law ) .",
    "we then added a mekal component with an abundance fixed at 0.8 solar .",
    "the improvement on @xmath57 has been recorded for each fake spectrum .",
    "we calculate the frequency that the improvement on @xmath57 is larger than what we observed for the real data .",
    "we define a significant iron l - shell hump when the frequency is smaller than 0.5% , or the iron l - shell hump is significant at @xmath3 99.5% .",
    "this analysis has been applied on all 160 x - ray candidates ( @xmath273.1 ) .",
    "a significant iron l - shell hump was detected in 33 single - source spectra so 33 coronae can be solely identified by the criterion 1 ( table 2 and 3 ) . as most x - ray sources are faint , spectra of 2 - 4 faint x - ray sources ( in the same cluster ) were stacked if they are close on the detector plane ( usually within 4@xmath58 ) .",
    "a significant iron l - shell hump was also detected in 4 stacked spectra of eight galaxies in a2634 and a2107 ( two in each stacked group , table 2 ) .",
    "the required significance can not be achieved in the spectra of other sources , although emission excess is present at the position of the iron l - shell hump in some spectra .",
    "we only examined the extent of x - ray sources of cluster galaxies if they are within 7@xmath58 of the optical axis , where the  angular resolution is still good ( 50% encircled energy radius of @xmath13 3.5@xmath18 at 1 kev ) .",
    "the 0.5 - 2 kev surface brightness profile of the source was compared with the point spread function ( psf ) model at 1 kev at the source location .",
    "the psf was first subtracted from the surface brightness profile with the central brightness normalized to that of the source .",
    "we allowed the normalization to scale up within the 1 @xmath53 error of the central bin of the source .",
    "only sources with 4 @xmath53 excess ( after subtracting the re - normalized psf ) are considered extended .",
    "we have also made sure that these extended sources are all soft x - ray sources from their spectral fits , as in principle , integrated emission from lmxb may also look extended .",
    "thirty - four sources were found to be extended , with 13 of them identified as coronae only by their spatial extents ( table 2 and 3 ) .",
    "for these 34 resolved coronae , their sizes can be estimated .",
    "the size is estimated from the fit to the 0.5 - 2 kev surface brightness profile centered on the corona , with a model composed of a truncated @xmath59 model plus the local background ( see detail in s05 for ngc  3842 and ngc  3837 , sjj05 for ngc  1265 ) .",
    "the local psf at 1 kev is also included in the modeling . however , the contribution from the lmxb emission is not included in the fit as most galaxies do not have  imaging data .",
    "the uncertainty of the size is generally 10% for bright coronae and up to 20% for faint ones .",
    "for unresolved coronae or soft x - ray sources within 7@xmath58 of the optical axis ( 32 sources in total ) , we can also derive the upper limit of their sizes from their surface brightness profiles , with a similar way as did for resolved coronae ( but without convolving the local psf ) .    while the coronae identified by these two criteria ( generally with @xmath3 80 net counts in the 0.5 - 3 kev band ) are robust , the data reveal many fainter soft x - ray sources in cluster galaxies .",
    "the identification of faint coronae ( @xmath28 10@xmath29 ergs s@xmath6 ) is indeed tricky , because most pointings of nearby hot clusters are not deep enough to study the coronal emission from a single galaxy in detail . nevertheless , the existence of faint coronae in hot clusters is unambiguous , e.g. , the faint , soft extended sources associated with ngc  3841 and cgcg  97090 in a1367 ( s05 ) , several coronae in the nearby centaurus and perseus clusters with significant iron l - shell hump ( ngc  4709 , ngc  4706 , ngc  1277 and cgcg  540 - 101 ) revealed from deep exposures as analyzed in this work . these faint coronae are small ( @xmath28 2 kpc in radius ) , if resolved .",
    "they have been unambiguously identified only because : 1 ) they happen to be very close to the optical axis ( e.g. , ngc  3841 and cgcg  97090 ) ; or 2 ) the observations are deep enough to reveal the iron l - shell hump in nearby cluster galaxies ( e.g. , in centaurus and perseus with @xmath1 0.02 ) . in our list of galaxies with soft x - ray detections , there are indeed some sources resolved .",
    "but many soft x - ray sources remained unresolved , especially the faint ones .",
    "moreover , the iron l - shell hump in faint x - ray sources may not be significant .",
    "for example , the stacked spectrum of ngc  3841 and cgcg  97090 in a1367 , two confirmed faint coronae , does not show a significant iron l - shell hump , and the 90% upper limit on the abundance is 0.13 solar .",
    "the iron abundance of early - type galaxies coronae may indeed be low in some cases .",
    "detailed work with  and  data on coronae of early - type galaxies in poor environments shows that iron abundances can be lower than 0.1 solar in some coronae ( e.g. , osullivan & ponman 2004 ; humphrey & buote 2006 ) .",
    "the low iron abundance , combined with low statistics , can make a seemingly featureless spectrum .",
    "moreover , many cluster galaxies have x - ray agn ( e.g. , 3c  264 and ic  310 in this work ) . when the x - ray agn are bright , it is very difficult to have a significant detection of a faint corona .",
    "the coronae of 3c  264 and ic  310 are only detected because they are close to the optical axis so the extended coronal emission can be resolved .",
    "even when the x - ray agn are not as bright as those of 3c  264 and ic  310 , it requires a deep exposure to distinguish the thermal spectral component from the hard agn component when the source is unresolved .",
    "therefore , the problem is how to identify faint coronae , when they are spatially unresolved or mixed with a central x - ray agn .",
    "unfortunately , with poor data statistics there is no a good way to reliably identify faint coronae .",
    "however , we can use the different spectral shapes of @xmath55 1 kev thermal sources from hard agn sources or x - ray binaries to explore the population of faint coronae . in this work ,",
    "we have taken the following approach to study the faint unresolved x - ray sources and define a sample of soft x - ray sources .",
    "we identify a soft x - ray source if the following criterion is met :    * for faint unresolved x - ray sources , if the spectrum is fitted with a power law , the 1 @xmath53 lower bound of the photon index ( @xmath60 ) is larger than 2.4 .",
    "this criterion comes from the fact that the spectra of agn are flatter or harder with @xmath60 of 1.5 - 2.0 ( e.g. , kim et al . 2004 ; shemmer et al .",
    "2005 ) , compared with the much steeper spectra of coronae when the iron l - shell hump is insignificant because of poor statistics or low abundance ( e.g. , @xmath60=2.9 for the stacked spectrum of ngc  3841 and cgcg  97090 in a1367 ) . as the uncertainty on the photon index for faint x - ray sources is large , the lower limit ( 2.4 ) is set on the 1 @xmath53 lower bound of the photon index , instead of the best fit of the photon index .",
    "therefore , the best fits of the photon index are larger than 3.0 in most cases that sources are identified as soft x - ray sources .",
    "the photon index of 2.4 was chosen conservatively from xspec simulations .",
    "we have run a series of xspec simulations ( with background added ) to understand the power law fits to weak x - ray sources ( 50 net counts in the 0.5 - 7 kev band ) .",
    "if a photon index of 2.2 is assumed for agn ( steeper than the usual value ) , 1000 xspec simulations with different responses and absorption show that in at most 12% of the simulations , a photon index with 1 @xmath53 lower bound @xmath3 2.4 is derived from the spectral fits . on the contrary , for genuine coronae with a high temperature ( @xmath3 1 kev ) and a low abundance ( @xmath55 0.1 solar ) , the chance that criterion 3 is not met is substantial even when no hard component is included . if a temperature of 1 kev and an abundance of 0.05 solar are assumed , 1000 xspec simulations with different responses and absorption show that in up to 45% of simulations criterion 3 is not met .",
    "when a hard component is added into the model , the chance that criterion 3 is not met becomes much higher .",
    "therefore , the criterion 3 is a conservative way to select faint coronae . in this work ,",
    "we have examined the spectra of all 114 sources that do not meet the criteria 1 and 2 .",
    "fifteen single spectra and six stacked spectra meet the criterion 3 and are selected ( 31 galaxies in total ) .",
    "representative spectra of a corona identified by the criterion 1 and a soft x - ray source identified by the criterion 3 are shown in fig .",
    "1 . in table 2 and 3 , we give the codes ( 1 or 2 : robust detections of coronae ; 3 : soft x - ray sources ) on how these sources are identified . in @xmath273.4 , we will discuss more on the nature of the faint soft x - ray sources .",
    "we are confident that most of such sources are genuine coronae .",
    "nevertheless , their nature does not affect our conclusion that coronae of massive cluster galaxies ( @xmath3 2  galaxies ) are ubiquitous in hot clusters .",
    "this section details the spectral analysis to identify coronae and to derive the spectral properties of the x - ray sources .",
    "x - ray sources with @xmath10 60 net counts and a @xmath61 detection in the 0.5 - 2 kev band are analyzed individually .",
    "the source spectrum was extracted within the region determined from the spatial analysis ( a 0.5 - 2 kev surface brightness profile centered on the source ) .",
    "the region source for the spectral extraction is then the same as the spatial extent of the source ( without psf correction ) .",
    "the background spectrum was extracted locally ( an annulus between the source radius and twice the source radius ) .",
    "the background spectra are generally normalized by the ratio of the geometric area of the source and background regions , unless the local background profile is not constant . in such cases ( generally only for cd galaxies )",
    ", we extrapolated the background profile into the source region and this extra factor was included in the normalization of the local background . because of small sizes of embedded coronae , the local background is generally still within the optical radius of the galaxy .",
    "each spectrum has been examined for a significant iron l - shell hump , based on the quantitative test stated in @xmath273.2",
    ".    however , there are many fainter x - ray sources associated with cluster galaxies . to fully explore the current data , we have stacked spectra of fainter sources in the same cluster ( 2 - 4 sources stacked in this work ) , if they are close to each other in the same fi or s3 chips and have similar net counts . the choice of sources to combine depends on the source location and we did not specifically combine sources with similar x - ray color , although almost all faint sources are only significantly detected in the soft band . in some clusters , there are faint x - ray sources that can not find others to stack so they can only be examined individually .",
    "stacked galaxies are listed adjacently in table 2 and only temperatures derived from the stacked spectra are showed .",
    "stacked spectra with a significant iron l - shell hump are given a code of 1 ( four such cases in table 2 ) , while those with a steep spectrum to meet the criterion 3 are given a code of 3 .",
    "the x - ray luminosities of stacked galaxies are derived by dividing the total x - ray luminosity according to the relative 0.5 - 2 kev flux of the combined sources . the stacking analysis and",
    "the classified soft x - ray sources by the criterion 3 allow us to explore faint unresolved coronae as a population , although the results may not always be accurate individually .",
    "these faint soft x - ray sources have been discussed more in the next section , where we argue that most of them should be genuine thermal coronae .",
    "because of the lmxb emission and the possible nuclear hard source , we always include a hard component ( a power law ) in the spectral model of coronae or soft x - ray sources . for bright coronae ( @xmath62 detections in the 0.5 - 2 kev band ) , we left the power law index free . for fainter coronae , we fixed the power law index at 1.7 , which is a good approximation for both lmxb and agn . when a significant iron l - shell hump is present , the determination of the coronal gas temperature is robust and changes little with the variation of abundance and the spectral shape of the hard component .",
    "however , the x - ray bolometric luminosities ( unabsorbed 0.01 - 100 kev luminosities in this work ) can vary by a factor of up to 2 with the change of the abundance ( e.g. , 0.03 - 2 solar ) . lowering the abundance increases the bolometric luminosity while the rest - frame 0.5 - 2 kev luminosity changes little . in this work , as the abundance of the coronal gas is constrained through the joint fit in @xmath274.7 , we fix the abundance of coronae at 0.8 solar when the x - ray luminosities are derived , unless the coronal abundance is smaller than 0.8 solar at the 95% confidence level ( only for ngc  3308 , ngc  3841 and cgcg  97090 in this work ) .",
    "the 1 @xmath53 confidence level of the rest - frame 0.5 - 2 kev luminosities of coronae are also estimated , by examining the allowed luminosity values when the coronal properties are changed within their allowed 1 @xmath53 range . for faint coronae ,",
    "the uncertainty is close to the statistical uncertainty . for bright coronae ,",
    "the uncertainty from the contribution of the hard component becomes dominant .",
    "the uncertainty on the bolometric luminosities , at least as high as that for the rest - frame 0.5 - 2 kev luminosities , is not given because of the unknown spectrum of coronae below 0.5 kev .",
    "we emphasize that the bolometric luminosities are derived by assuming an abundance of 0.8 solar .",
    "nevertheless , the uncertainties of bolometric luminosities are mainly on the upper bound . the bolometric luminosity at most decreases by 8% when abundance is increased from 0.8 solar to 2 solar .",
    "the increase brought by the decrease of abundance from 0.8 solar to 0.05 solar is however 15% for 1.5 kev gas and 100% for 0.4 kev gas .",
    "the 0.5 - 2 kev luminosity of the hard component is generally 10% - 30% of the total 0.5 - 2 kev luminosity , except for sources with significant x - ray agn .",
    "we can not determine the absolute luminosity contributed by lmxb in the aperture used to analyze coronal spectra , since some lmxb contribution is contained in the local background , which is generally still within the galaxy .",
    "nevertheless , we did fit any residual lmxb component and thus our parameter estimates for the coronal emission are uncontaminated by lmxb emission .    besides the parameter estimates of identified thermal coronae",
    ", we also want to determine the upper limits of coronal emission for galaxies without coronal detection .",
    "the upper limits need to be derived in a homogeneous way for both galaxies without x - ray detection and galaxies detected in x - rays but without coronal detection . for nir / optical or radio selected galaxies without x - ray detections , a 3-@xmath53 upper limit ( @xmath53 from poisson distribution )",
    "was derived from the 0.5 - 2 kev emission at the position of the galaxy .",
    "we fix the aperture at 3 kpc radius . to address the smearing of the psf ( especially at large off - axis angle )",
    ", we added the 90% encircled energy average radius of the local psf at 1 kev to the 3 kpc radius .",
    "although there are some coronae with radii larger than 3 kpc , the enclosed x - ray light within 3 kpc radius is always @xmath3 90% , except for ngc  7720 and ic  1633 , which are all cds with luminous coronae . for the purpose of upper limits , we assume a coronal spectrum with a temperature of 0.7 kev and an abundance of 0.8 solar .",
    "these temperature and abundance values are typical for embedded coronae of @xmath63 @xmath64 early - type galaxies ( see @xmath274 ) , while all galaxies with upper limits in our sample are indeed fainter than this threshold .",
    "these temperature and abundance values are also fair assumptions for coronae of late - type galaxies ( see @xmath275 ) .",
    "the response files at the position of the source are generated to convert count rates to fluxes .",
    "compared with the galaxies without x - ray detection , it is trickier to determine the upper limits for galaxies with x - ray sources that do not meet any of criteria in @xmath273.2 ( e.g.,unresolved hard x - ray sources without a significant iron l - shell hump ) .",
    "the concern is how to determine the upper limits of the soft component in the spectra and how to define the aperture .",
    "there are some soft x - ray sources that do not meet criterion 3 . however , their spectra are also fitted well by a thermal model plus a power law with the limited statistics .",
    "there are also unresolved hard x - ray sources close to the optical axis . as the aperture for",
    "the spectral extraction may be smaller than 3 kpc ( especially for lower @xmath33 clusters , e.g. , perseus ) , the possible coronal emission beyond the region of the central point - like source ( but still within a 3 kpc radius ) needs to be considered . in this work ,",
    "we have taken the following approach to estimate upper limits in a consistent way as we did for galaxies without x - ray detections .",
    "we first added a 0.7 kev thermal component with an abundance of 0.8 solar to the source spectra .",
    "the upper limit of the coronal emission in the source spectrum is set at the best - fit of the soft component plus 1 @xmath53 error .",
    "this approach allows the possible coronal flux in the source spectrum to enter the upper limit .",
    "if the radius of the spectral extracting region is smaller than 3 kpc ( after psf correction ) , a 3-@xmath53 upper limit was further derived between the the 3 kpc radius and the spectral extracting region as did for galaxies without x - ray detection . a coronal spectrum with a temperature of 0.7 kev and an abundance of 0.8 solar is still assumed .",
    "the final upper limit is then the sum of the limits in these two regions .",
    "we treat late - type galaxies in a different way as thermal gas of the late - type galaxies can be more extended and fill large portions of the galaxy ( @xmath275 and examples in the appendix ) .",
    "we used an elliptical aperture with a semi - major axis of 10 kpc .",
    "the size of the semi - minor axis is determined from the ellipticity of the galaxy and the assumed semi - major axis .",
    "we still added the 90% encircled energy average radius of the local psf at 1 kev to the aperture .",
    "all other procedures and assumption to estimate upper limits are the same as those for early - type galaxies .",
    "our analysis has generated a list of robust detections of coronae ( by criteria 1 or 2 ) and faint soft x - ray sources ( single or stacked ) .",
    "for soft x - ray sources identified by the criterion 3 , the simulations ( @xmath273.2 ) indicate that the contamination from the pure power law agn should be small ( @xmath55 12% ) .",
    "therefore , the most natural explanation of these soft x - ray sources are faint coronae .",
    "in fact , many sources show emission excess at the energy band of the iron l - shell hump , but not significantly enough to meet the 99.5% significance level we set . if the four sources in a3376 , and the eight sources in mkw3s identified by the criterion 3 ( table 2 ) are stacked respectively , a significant iron l - shell hump is measured in both stacked spectra .",
    "a significant iron l - shell hump is also measured if the four faint soft x - ray sources identified by the criterion 3 in a496 , a576 , a3571 and a4059 are stacked .",
    "therefore , a significant portion of these 16 soft x - ray sources should be genuine coronae .",
    "one contaminating source to faint coronae identified by the criterion 3 could be the faint agn with soft x - ray excess , which dominates below @xmath13 0.5 kev ( e.g. , arnaud et al .",
    "1985 ; walter & fink 1993 ) .",
    "the soft excess generally behaves as a steep power - law ( photon index up to 3.4 , walter & fink 1993 ) at the soft band ( e.g. , 0.1 - 2.4 kev  band ) .",
    "while the soft x - ray excess is especially strong in narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies , the galaxies we are mainly interested are early - types .",
    "in fact , none of the early - type galaxies identified by the criterion 3 are known optical agn in the literature . moreover ,",
    "the usual hard component with a photon index of 1.4 - 2.2 is always significant in the 2 - 10 kev spectra of agn with soft excess .",
    "page et al . ( 2004 ) analyzed  spectra of seven qsos with soft excesses .",
    "if the soft excess is fitted with a mekal model , the temperature is between 0.1 - 0.5 kev and the abundance is zero .",
    "the photon index of the hard component is 1.7 - 2.2 .",
    "piconcelli et al .",
    "( 2005 ) investigated  data of 40 qsos .",
    "they presented fits to the soft excess with bremsstrahlung , which is close to mekal model with zero abundance .",
    "the average temperature of the soft excess is about 0.38 kev , while the average photon index of the hard component is @xmath13 1.8 .",
    "we have fitted the spectra of soft x - ray sources we identified with the criterion 3 with the same model , power law + bremsstrahlung . although the temperature range , 0.3 - 0.6 kev , is not too far from the typical values for the soft excess in agn , the soft - to - hard flux ratio at the 0.5 - 2 kev band is much higher , 2.1 - 27 with a median of 4 - 5 , compared with 0.06 - 3.0 with a median of 0.65 in piconcelli et al .",
    "in other words , the soft component is dominant in sources identified by criterion 3 , different from typical soft excess seen in agn .",
    "moreover , the fits with `` power law + bremsstrahlung '' are always worse than the fits with `` power law + mekal '' ( with abundance fixed at 0.8 solar , the same degree of freedom ) , which implies the emission excess at the energy band of the iron l - shell hump . based on all these facts , we consider that the contamination from the agn with soft excess is small .",
    "therefore , we conclude that most of soft x - ray sources identified by the criterion 3 are genuine thermal coronae . they just can not be unambiguously identified individually as the available  exposures are usually not deep enough .",
    "nevertheless , when the properties of embedded coronae are investigated in @xmath274 , we always labeled the soft x - ray sources identified by criterion 3 differently from robust detections and always discuss the effects of adding them into the coronal population .",
    "for the 3.77 deg@xmath35 sky coverage of these 25 clusters in the sample , 46 coronae ( identified by the criteria 1 or 2 ) and 30 soft x - ray sources ( identified by the criterion 3 ) are detected from a sample of 157 early - type galaxies .",
    "their properties are summarized in table 2 and the color - luminosity relation of all galaxies in our sample is shown in fig .",

    "3 , where @xmath69 is used as it is more robustly measured than @xmath70 . the relations are complete for @xmath71 0.74  galaxies , and for @xmath72 0.88  galaxies ( assuming @xmath45 = 4.0 ) in the  field .",
    "dispersion in both plots is large ( greater than one order of magnitude ) .",
    "the dispersion should arise from the combined effects of the internal dispersion and the variation caused by environmental effects .",
    "cluster galaxies with low density coronae ( in the wind phase ) may have already been fully stripped and are currently `` naked '' with little galactic gas .",
    "cluster galaxies with dense galactic cooling cores can maintain their gas cores even in dense environments , and therefore are still x - ray luminous .",
    "therefore , the @xmath73 - @xmath15 relation for embedded coronae in hot clusters is really an envelope instead of a tight relation .",
    "we perform fits with a function of log @xmath74 = @xmath75 log ( @xmath76 ) . for robust detections with criteria 1 or 2",

    "we have also applied the survival analysis ( feigelson & nelson 1985 ) to compute linear regression for both detections and upper limits .",
    "the survival analysis requires that the censoring distribution about the fitted line is random .",
    "we consider it is a fair assumption for most of our data , as upper limits are randomized by many factors ( exposure , cluster background , galactic absorption and the offset of the galaxy to the optical axis ) and not tightly related to the real luminosities of the coronae .",
    "moreover , almost all  observations we analyzed were intended to study the icm , rather than cluster galaxies .",
    "the buckley - james algorithm in stsdas , with the kaplan - meier estimator , has been used .",

    ", we measured : @xmath85 in the @xmath16 band and @xmath86 in the @xmath84 band .",

    "for ngc  3862 , the  luminosity ( 55 times the  value ) , is the contribution of the bright nucleus . for ngc  4889 (  value 79 times larger ) and ngc  3311 (  value 32 times larger ) ,",
    "the luminosities are dominated by the contribution from the surrounding icm as the pspc apertures for the sources are large .",

    "the lower bound uncertainty of @xmath138 is small ( @xmath13 10% ) so the observed difference is very significant .",
    "the noao fundamental plane survey shows that the age of an early - type galaxy is correlated with the stellar velocity dispersion ( nelan et al . 2005 ) .",

    "we conclude that for almost all luminous coronae ( @xmath142 ergs s@xmath6 ) the energy release by the stellar mass loss is too small to balance cooling of the coronal gas .",
    "this conclusion is further supported in @xmath274.5 where we find that the coronal temperatures are generally higher than the stellar kinetic temperatures .",
    "we would like to understand which factors govern the survival and destruction of coronae , by examining the properties of their host galaxies and clusters .",
    "however , we should be aware that the detection limit of embedded coronae varies even in the same cluster . as shown in fig .",
    "3 , below @xmath127 of @xmath143 , the upper limits become comparable to the detections . indeed , identifications of coronae and soft x - ray sources are found to be distance - dependent .",

    "besides distance , exposure , icm background , galaxy s angular distance from the optical axis of the observations , and galactic absorption all affect the achieved sensitivity .",
    "nevertheless , our discussion can only be based on the current data sample .",
    "this `` bias '' factor for x - ray faint coronae has to be kept in mind when results are interpreted .",
    "the detection rate of x - ray coronae varies significantly from cluster to cluster .",
    "there are no coronae detected in a2147 , a2199 and a4038 ( 17 galaxies brighter than 0.74  in total ) , while the detection rate is over 50% for perseus , a1367 and a2634 ( @xmath10 7 galaxies per cluster ) .",
    "it is unclear what causes the variation from cluster to cluster and why coronae in a2147 , a2199 and a4038 are faint or no longer exist .",
    "we also do not find any significant changes of detection rate with the cluster temperature or velocity dispersion , no matter whether the soft x - ray sources identified by the criterion 3 are included .",
    "we have also examined the relation of the detection rate with @xmath127 or @xmath17 of the host galaxy .",
    "we took a conservative measure to count only half of soft x - ray sources identified by criterion 3 as genuine coronae . for @xmath3 2  galaxies ( @xmath146 ; @xmath147 ) , the detection rate is 60% and 64% respectively ( out of 44 galaxies in the @xmath43 band and 37 galaxies in the @xmath16 band ) .",
    "in fact , some @xmath3 2  galaxies without coronal detections have small @xmath132 .",
    "thus , we also examined the detection rate from the @xmath109 plot .",
    "we set the thresholds for a 2  galaxy with a @xmath132 of 250 km / s . above that thresholds ,",
    "the detection rates of coronae are 68% and 72% respectively ( out of 38 galaxies in the @xmath43 band and 30 galaxies in the @xmath16 band ) .",

    "when fainter galaxies are examined , the average level of upper limits becomes comparable to that of detections .",
    "for galaxies with @xmath127 between  and 2  ( 54 in total in this sample ) , we conclude that at least 40% of galaxies have their coronae survived , as there are 18 robust detections and 12 identified as soft x - ray sources . even for @xmath55  ( 10@xmath148 ) galaxies ,",
    "a significant number of coronae ( 5 robust detections and 11 identified as soft x - ray sources , fig .",
    "3 ) have been revealed although many upper limits are higher than detections .",
    "the detection rate of corona also increases with the stellar velocity dispersion of the host galaxy , from @xmath13 20% at @xmath149 200 km / s , to @xmath13 50% at 200 kms/ @xmath150 300 km / s , to @xmath13 80% at @xmath151 300 km / s .",
    "we have also examined the relation of the detection rate with the @xmath45 color ( fig .",
    "2 ) and failed to find any clear evidence for correlation . this may not be surprising as the color - luminosity map shows that the average @xmath45 color is nearly constant for @xmath52 galaxies .",
    "we have also examined the distributions of the relative velocity of galaxies to that of the cluster for galaxies with and without coronal detections .",
    "no significant difference was found , for all galaxies or for only @xmath55 2 galaxies .",
    "the relation between the detection rate and galaxy position in clusters is also examined .",
    "the distance of galaxies to the cluster center was normalized with the size of the cluster dense core defined as the radius where the icm electron density reaches 0.005 @xmath11 .",
    "however , we did not find any significant difference between detections and non - detections , for all @xmath3 0.74  galaxies or only for 0.74  @xmath4 2 galaxies .",
    "the failure to find a significant difference may not be surprising as the difference may only exist for faint galaxies generally with low density coronae , for which the true detection rate is confused by high upper limits .",
    "moreover , little knowledge of the complete stripping history of cluster galaxies ( as they move around the clusters ) , as well as the projection effect , also dilutes correlations .    in summary ,",
    "our results show that coronae are very common for @xmath10 galaxies .",
    "the increase of the detection rate of coronae with the optical / nir luminosity and the stellar velocity dispersion of the galaxy is also implied by the current data , but how much is due to the observational bias for x - ray faint coronae is unknown .",
    "the x - ray coronae of @xmath28 galaxies are generally indeed faint and have low density ( e.g. , david et al .",
    "2006 ) , which should make them less likely to survive in high pressure environments compared with massive galaxies with galactic cooling cores .",
    "the detection rate can vary a lot from cluster to cluster ( at least for bright coronae ) .",
    "the detection rate is not apparently correlated with the cluster temperature or velocity dispersion .",
    "we have also examined the @xmath153 relation for coronae in our sample ( fig . 6 ) .",
    "the generalized kendall s tau and the generalized spearman s rho tests in stsdas have been used to examine the correlation coefficient .",
    "both tests are able to handle the data with censoring in both independent and dependent variables . a moderate correlation ( 96.9% significance )",
    "is found from both tests . if the luminosity of the nuclear hard source is added ( the right panel of fig .",
    "6 ) , the correlation becomes more significant ( 99.99% from both tests ) .",
    "many coronae in our sample are associated with powerful radio sources .",
    "in fact , for 16 galaxies with an 1.4 ghz luminosity of @xmath154 w hz@xmath6 ( our selection threshold for radio bright galaxies , @xmath272.2 ) , 10 have robust coronal detections , while pgc018297 in a3376 has a soft x - ray source .",
    "four other sources are detected in x - rays ( generally with hard spectra ) , while only pgc3097068 in ophiuchus is not detected . even for these sources without coronal detections ,",
    "the upper limits are generally high ( @xmath155 ergs s@xmath6 in the 0.5 - 2 kev band ) except for ngc  4869 in coma , which has a soft x - ray spectrum that however does not meet the criterion 3 .",
    "the presence of a significant gas component ( @xmath156 ) potentially provides the fuel for the central super - massive black hole ( smbh ) , in environments where the amount of the galactic cold gas is at a minimum .",
    "therefore , our results suggest a general connection between the cooling of the coronal gas and the agn activity .",
    "we can classify the x - ray emission of radio luminous galaxies into three classes : corona - dominated ( e.g. , eso  137 - 006 , the most luminous radio galaxy in our sample , see appendix ) , x - ray - nucleus - dominated ( e.g. , eso  137 - 007 , ic  310 and 3c  264 , see appendix ) and mixed ( e.g. , ngc  1265 ) . all seven galaxies with @xmath3 10@xmath157 ergs s@xmath6 ( 0.5 - 2 kev ) coronae are corona - dominated , while both galaxies with x - ray agn more luminous than 10@xmath157 ergs s@xmath6 are x - ray - nucleus - dominated .",
    "there is however no a galaxy with both a luminous corona ( @xmath12 ergs s@xmath6 ) and a luminous x - ray agn ( @xmath158 ergs s@xmath6 ) .",
    "studies of the x - ray emission of luminous radio sources actually extend beyond those in hot clusters .",
    "we note that dense coronae have also been found around the nuclei of luminous radio sources in cooler groups or clusters , e.g. , 3c  31 ( hardcastle et al .",
    "2002 ) , 3c  296 ( hardcastle et al .",
    "2005 ) , cd galaxies of a160 and a2462 ( jetha et al . 2005 ) .",
    "s05 and sjj05 reported an anti - correlation of x - ray morphology with radio surface brightness distributions in ngc  3842 , ngc  4874 and ngc  1265 , and concluded that the jets traverse the coronae with little energy dissipation .",
    "just outside the coronae , the radio emission `` turns on '' .",
    "however , not many coronae in our sample are well resolved and not many radio galaxies in our sample have high - resolution radio images that allow us to examine this morphological anti - correlation in a much larger sample .",

    "the @xmath160 relation of embedded coronae also does not show a significant correlation , as coronae that are less luminous than 10@xmath157 ergs s@xmath6 coronae all have a similar temperature of 0.5 - 1 kev .",

    "we have also examined the relationship between @xmath161 and @xmath119 ( or @xmath163 to mimic the saturated evaporation by the icm ) , and find no correlation .",
    "this implies that the icm heat flux is not the reason for the over - heating of the coronal gas relative to stars .",
    "we notice that small @xmath161 has also been found for coronae in the field or poor environments with the  data ( e.g. , 0.3 - 1 by david et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "one may notice that the bottom left of fig .",
    "8 is not populated with any coronae and almost all coronae are hotter than 0.4 kev .",
    "is this real or due to the observational bias ?",
    "for low temperature plasma ( @xmath55 0.35 kev ) , the iron l - shell hump becomes not significant any more .",

    "the soft x - ray sources identified by the criterion 3 are also generally hotter than 0.4 kev .",
    "galaxy coronae with temperature of @xmath55 0.4 kev are indeed reported in poor environments ( e.g. , @xmath13 0.25 kev gas in ngc  4697 , sarazin et al .",

    "seven coronae they examined just fill the bottom left of fig . 8 with temperatures of 0.2 - 0.4 kev .",
    "however , these coronae are too faint ( @xmath164 ergs s@xmath6 ) to be detected with our data and their low gas density ( central electron density of 0.003 - 0.02 @xmath11 ) makes them hard to survive in dense environment .",
    "thus , we conclude , above our detection limit ( @xmath165 ergs s@xmath6 ) , embedded coronae are almost all hotter than 0.4 kev .    for seven luminous coronae within @xmath166 of the optical axis ,",

    "the derived abundance from the mekal model is 0.79@xmath170 solar , which is consistent with the derived abundances of all these coronae within 95% . as this abundance value is only an average value for the whole corona and an abundance gradient may exist inside coronae ( s05 ; sjj05 ) , the coronal gas is indeed more enriched in iron than the icm ( @xmath13 0.3 solar ) , which is consistent with a stellar origin of the coronal gas ( e.g. , humphrey & buote 2006 ) .",

    "19 and 24 ) , while their stripping fronts are only @xmath13 4 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "ngc  3860 is a sa galaxy with a low - density x - ray corona ( sun & murray 2002a ) .",
    "h@xmath172 observations implied it may still have a substantial star formation activity ( e.g. , cortese et al . 2006 ) , which may help to explain its larger low - density corona than the typical ones of early - type galaxies ( see @xmath275 ) .",
    "both ngc  7720 and ic  1633 are cd galaxies so the residual motion of coronae may be small , which allows the retention of the outskirts of the galactic cooling core .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath13 90% of embedded coronae have a radius of @xmath28 4 kpc , which is expected as stripping can quickly remove the gas on the outskirts in dense environments .",
    "we should be aware that the lmxb emission is not subtracted from the fits of surface brightness profiles . including the lmxb component may reduce the measured sizes ( e.g. , s05 ) .",
    "one may argue that any low surface brightness outskirts of x - ray coronae may hide in the icm background .",
    "however , as these embedded coronae are pressure confined in the high - pressure environments , the coronal density at the boundary can not be low from the argument of pressure equilibrium ( equ . 3 and 4 ) .",
    "for three coronae that we have done detailed analysis ( ngc  3842 , ngc  3837 and ngc  1265 , from s05 and sjj05 ) , we find that the coronal densities at the boundary derived from surface brightness fits are consistent with the expected values from pressure equilibrium ( note we normalized the densities of ngc  3842 and ngc  3837 to lower values as s05 used low coronal abundances of 0.32 - 0.56 solar ) .",
    "moreover , we use the density models of ngc  1404 ( r@xmath36=0.31 kpc and @xmath59=0.481 from our own analysis ) and ngc  4697 ( r@xmath36=0.16 kpc and @xmath59=0.335 , sarazin et al .",

    "the gas density at 4 kpc radius is 7.5@xmath173 @xmath11 . assuming a local icm density of 5@xmath174 @xmath11 and a @xmath175 ratio of 6 , the required ambient pressure ( thermal pressure + ram pressure )",
    "can be achieved with a velocity of 1000 km / s for a 0.7 kev corona . with the same assumptions for a faint ngc  4697-like corona with a central density of 0.08 @xmath11 ,",
    "the coronal boundary has to be as small as 1.7 kpc for the pressure equilibrium .",
    "thus , the derived size distribution is consistent with expectation in dense environments .",
    "the x - ray gas mass of coronae is generally in the range of 10@xmath7 - 10@xmath8 m@xmath9 , for coronal sizes of 1.5 - 4 kpc .",
    "the most massive coronae are those of ngc  7720 and ic  1633 , with gas mass of 0.64 - 1.0 @xmath176 m@xmath9 , because of their larger sizes .",
    "therefore , the coronae of ngc  7720 and ic  1633 really stand out in this sample .",
    "although we have argued that large sizes of their coronae may be related to the small residual motion of the galaxies relative to the surrounding icm , it is also possible that the x - ray sources of ngc  7720 and ic  1633 have a different origin from other coronae .",
    "we note that central x - ray sources with the similar size and mass as the ones associated with ngc  7720 and ic  1633 are also presented in some 2 - 3 kev clusters ( e.g. , eso  306 - 017 by sun et al .",
    "2004 , eso  5520200 and ngc  6269 ) .",
    "we have argued that the small cool core of eso  306 - 017 may be the relic of a previous cluster cooling core , after heating by the central agn .",
    "this picture may also apply for the x - ray sources of ngc  7720 and ic  1633 , especially as the radio source associated with ngc  7720 is the second most luminous radio galaxy in our sample .",
    "although we have detected 76 embedded coronae or soft x - ray sources of early - type galaxies in hot clusters , only pgc  018313 in a3376 has a significant long tail ( appendix , fig .",

    "the x - ray coronae in late - type galaxies usually have low density and are thus difficult to sustain in high - pressure environments , unless there is significant gas supply from active star formation .",

    "a better comparison requires more work on galaxies fainter than our threshold and likely optical follow - ups for completeness , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "fainter agn ( @xmath183 ergs s@xmath6 ) are indeed detected in many galaxies in our sample as about two third of galaxies are detected by and at least 20% galaxies in our sample have nuclear hard component ( table 2 and 3 ) .",
    "another uncertainty on the agn fraction is the fraction of absorbed agn as they are faint . in the nine luminous agn in our sample ,",

    "a cartoon of the structure of embedded corona is shown in fig . 12 .",
    "a boundary layer lies between the corona and the icm . as strong gradients of temperature and velocity",
    "are present in the boundary layer , transport phenomena become important there .",
    "we next discuss the relevant physics of these embedded coronae .",
    "the coronae in hot clusters are subject to stripping by the icm as the velocity dispersion of galaxies in hot clusters is high ( 520 - 1100 km / s along the line of sight in this sample ) .",
    "the internal thermal pressure of coronae is generally high enough to overcome the ram pressure as shown in @xmath274.1 .",
    "gravitational restoring force can also help to sustain the coronal gas if the ram pressure moves the coronae off - center .",
    "nevertheless , nearly all resolved coronae are centered on the galactic nuclei .",
    "besides ram pressure , coronae also suffer stripping through transport processes ( viscosity or turbulence ) at the corona - icm interface ( or a boundary layer ) ( nulsen 1982 ) .",
    "the typical mass - loss rate of the corona by stripping through transport processes is approximately ( e.g. , nulsen 1982 ) :    @xmath186    the typical timescale of complete stripping is :    @xmath187    @xmath188    where a @xmath59 model is still assumed for the coronal density profile and all symbols have the same meaning as those in @xmath274.1 .",
    "we have calculated @xmath189 for several coronae with different starting and ending coronal sizes . for ngc  1404 , @xmath189(4 - 10 kpc ) = 0.24 and @xmath189(0 - 4 kpc )",
    "= 2.16 ( r@xmath36=0.306 kpc , @xmath59=0.48 ) . for ngc  3842 , @xmath189(2 - 4.1 kpc ) = 0.23 and @xmath189(0 - 4.1 kpc ) = 1.69 ( r@xmath36=0.56 kpc , @xmath59=0.56 ) . for ngc  1256 , @xmath189(1 - 2.3 kpc ) = 0.16 and @xmath189(0 - 2.3 kpc ) = 1.29 ( r@xmath36=0.40 kpc , @xmath59=0.73 ) .",
    "thus , the removal of the small dense core of a corona may not be very quick ( @xmath13 0.5 gyr ) , but the outer layers ( @xmath10 4 kpc radius ) of large coronae can be removed in much shorter time ( @xmath13 50 myr ) .",
    "therefore , stripping is very efficient at reducing the size of coronae to @xmath28 4 kpc and should be the main reason for the small sizes of embedded coronae ( @xmath274.8 ) . even for coronae with a size of @xmath13 4 kpc ,",
    "the stripping is still efficient to reduce its size to 1 - 2 kpc quickly .",
    "the complete stripping of the whole coronae may take up to 1 gyr , but the stripping beyond 1.5 kpc radius region is @xmath3 5 times faster . as the prevalence of coronae of massive galaxies implies a lifetime of about at least several gyr and many coronae",
    "have a size of 2 - 4 kpc , the coronal gas must be replenished .",
    "as we discussed in s05 and sjj05 , the stellar mass loss can replenish the coronal gas lost through stripping .",
    "although the enclosed stellar light in embedded coronae is only @xmath13 30% of the total light , the stellar mass loss outside the corona ( region iii in fig .",
    "12 ) may also help to reduce the impact of the icm wind momentum and `` shield '' the small corona at the center .",
    "this `` shielding '' effect has been examined for three galaxies with known optical light profiles , ngc  3842 , ngc  3837 and ngc  1265 ( s05 ; sjj05 ) .",
    "the stellar mass loss rate by faber & gallagher ( 1976 ) was used .",
    "we assume that the stellar mass loss rate is proportional to the stellar light and follows the stellar light distribution .",
    "therefore , the percentage of the stellar light ahead of the corona ( within the cross section of the corona ) can be derived by deprojecting the measured two - dimensional stellar light profile .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "13 as a function of the assumed coronal size ( r ) .",
    "the direct `` shielding '' ahead of small coronae is however small , only 3% - 5% of the total stellar mass loss , for coronae of ngc  3842 , ngc  3837 and ngc  1265 ( 2.3 - 4.1 kpc in radius ) .",
    "therefore , the mass loss through stripping ( equ .",
    "5 ) needs to be balanced by the stellar mass loss in the boundary layer of the corona .",
    "we have examined this scenario for coronae of ngc  3842 , ngc  3837 and ngc  1265 by assuming a width of the boundary layer of 0.5 kpc .",
    "we assume that only stellar mass loss in the boundary layer can replenish the gas lost from stripping , while the stellar mass loss interior to the boundary layer can not contribute .",
    "the properties of the coronae and the icm are adopted from s05 and sjj05 .",
    "we use velocities of 500 km / s , 1400 km / s and 3000 km / s for ngc  3842 , ngc  3837 and ngc  1265 respectively ( s05 and sjj05 ) .",
    "it is easy to find out that stripping estimated from equ .",
    "5 is too strong and must be suppressed .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "14 , stripping needs to be suppressed by a factor of 13 - 22 from the rate predicted by equ . 5 , to allow the gas balance to achieve in the boundary layers of these coronae .",
    "since the stellar mass loss at the back side of coronae may not help to balance the gas loss from stripping ( acting on the front and the side ) , the required suppression factors may be even larger .",
    "there are certainly some uncertainties in this simple analysis , e.g. , the size of the boundary layer and the velocity of coronae .",
    "nevertheless , we conclude that stripping has to be suppressed by at least a factor of ten from that predicted by equ . 5 to allow the gas balance in the boundary layer .",
    "thus , turbulence or viscosity has to be suppressed by at least a factor of ten at the coronal boundary . obviously",
    ", magnetic field , responsible for the suppression of heat conduction ( @xmath277.2 ) , should also be responsible for suppressing the instabilities at the boundary .",
    "as long as the stripping is largely suppressed , the balanced radius is stabilized as implied by fig . 14 . if stripping overwhelms at a point , the size of the corona decrease so the stellar mass loss rate in the boundary layer increases to return to the balance point",
    "therefore , the size distribution of embedded coronae ( generally 2 - 4 kpc in radius ) can be explained by this scenario with reduced stripping balanced by the stellar mass loss in the boundary layer .",
    "another good example to examine is the cd of a3558 ( eso  444 - 046 , see appendix and fig .",
    "27 and 28 ) , which is located in a dense non - cool core with a central electron density of @xmath13 0.015 @xmath11 ( rossetti et al .",
    "the gas core of a3558 is `` sloshing '' , which may be triggered by the past merger with a nearby cluster sc  1327 - 312 ( e.g. , rossetti et al .",
    "2006 ) . using the pressure difference across the northwestern cold front ( fig . 27 ) , rossetti et al .",
    "( 2006 ) derived a velocity of @xmath13 940 km / s for the gas core .",
    "however , internal velocity field may be complicated , as implied by the eastern sharp edge ( fig .",
    "27 ) and simulations ( e.g. , ascasibar & markevitch 2006 ) . as sc  1327 - 312 is 1.4 mpc from the gas core of a3558 in the plane of sky , the `` sloshing '' of a3358 s gas core must have proceeded for over 1 gyr . over the course of `` sloshing '' , the corona of eso  444 - 046 should be subject to the stripping of the dense icm even the galaxy may stay at the bottom of the potential . repeating the exercise that we did for the three previous coronae , we find that stripping has to be suppressed by a factor of over 20 from equ .",
    "5 , even assuming a small relative velocity of eso  444 - 046 s corona to the surrounding icm ( 200 km / s ) . therefore",
    ", the very existence of eso  444 - 046 s corona in the dense core of a3558 either puts strong constraint on stripping , or on the central velocity field during the core `` sloshing '' , or both .",
    "the prevalence of cool ( 0.5 - 1.1 kev ) coronae in massive galaxies in hot clusters indicates that their lifetime is long ( at least several gyr ) and that they are in approximate energy balance , which contrasts with the short timescale of evaporation as previously noticed ( v01 ; s05 ; sjj05 ) .",
    "the saturated conductive heat flux across the ism - icm interface is ( cowie & mckee 1977 ) :    @xmath190    thus , the total heat flux across the whole surface of the corona is : 8.2@xmath89 ( t / 5 kev)@xmath191 ( n@xmath192 @xmath11 ) ( r / 3 kpc)@xmath35 ergs s@xmath6 , which is much larger than the typical x - ray luminosity of embedded coronae .",

    "t@xmath195 r@xmath35 f(@xmath196 ) , where f(@xmath196 ) is a weak function of the saturation parameter @xmath196 ( f(@xmath196 ) @xmath197 @xmath198 , equ 32 and fig . 4 of cowie & mckee 1977 ) .",
    "therefore , the evaporation time of the layer ( r , r+dr ) is @xmath197 n@xmath199 r@xmath200 dr , assuming constant n@xmath194 and t@xmath194 in the process of evaporation . as @xmath59 of luminous coronae is always @xmath3 1/3 and the core radius of the coronal gas is generally @xmath55 0.5 kpc , the evaporation time is largest at small radii , e.g. , 0.5 - 3 kpc radius .",
    "the times for the current coronae of ngc  4874 , ngc  4889 , ngc  1265 , ngc  3842 and ngc  3837 to fully evaporate are 3.4 - 35 myr , with the properties of the coronae and the icm derived in v01 , s05 and sjj05 , if the spitzer conductivity is assumed .",
    "the total evaporation time at most increases by @xmath13 20% if an original coronal size of 10 kpc is assumed for these coronae .",
    "therefore , the coronal boundary can not be the conduction front and heat conduction across the coronal boundary has to be greatly suppressed .",
    "the best constraints on the suppression of heat conduction are from coronae in the hottest clusters ( e.g. , @xmath3 5 kev ) .",
    "we have not found that the detection rate of coronae in @xmath3 5 kev clusters differs from that in 3 - 5 kev clusters . by balancing the evaporating flux and the cooling flux of the corona",
    ", it is required that heat conduction has to be suppressed by a factor of at least 70 - 500 for coronae with @xmath10 2 kpc radii in six @xmath0 5 kev clusters in our sample .",
    "the limit on the suppression factor is a little weaker in 3 - 5 kev clusters , but still @xmath3 30 - 300 .",
    "the natural way to inhibit heat conduction is magnetic field .",
    "what is the origin of magnetic field at the coronal boundary ?",
    "lyutikov ( 2006 ) argued that the draping of the icm magnetic field is responsible for the suppression of heat conduction across the boundary of cold fronts in clusters .",
    "when a plasma cloud ( e.g. , a cluster gas core ) moves through a weakly magnetized icm , a thin , strongly magnetized boundary layer will form in the front , where transport processes across the layer may be strongly suppressed .",
    "however , it is unclear whether magnetic draping can occur at scales as small as a few kpc around coronae , as the scale is smaller than the mean free path of particles in the icm and likely smaller than the coherence length of magnetic fields in the icm .",
    "moreover , although magnetic draping may explain the suppression of heat conduction at the front , the transport processes at the back and probably the sides are not addressed .",
    "magnetic draping also should not be a factor for coronae at the cluster centers with little residual motion ( e.g. , cd of a3558 , two cds in coma ) .",
    "therefore , the longevity of embedded coronae in hot clusters may be strong evidence that the coronal gas of early - type galaxies is magnetized .",
    "moreover , the galactic magnetic field is disconnected from the magnetic field in the icm , keeping the heat conduction across the corona boundary very low .",
    "this raises a general question on the galactic magnetic field evolution when the galaxy is falling into a dense environment .",
    "current simulations ignore the effects of magnetic field , although it is shown to be important for energy transfer in embedded coronae .",
    "our knowledge of the magnetic field in elliptical galaxies is also poor ( reviewed by widrow 2002 ) .",
    "galactic magnetic fields may also dissipate if turbulent diffusion is strong .",
    "this requires continuous amplification to maintain the galactic magnetic field .",
    "it is unclear how the galactic magnetic field remains disconnected from the field in the icm over cosmological timescales .      since the first derivation of the @xmath26 relation ,",
    "the effects and importance of environment have been discussed .",
    "different observational results have been obtained supporting both positive and negative environmental effects on coronae .",
    "brown & bregman ( 2000 ) claimed a positive ( but weak ) correlation between @xmath201 / @xmath202 and local galaxy density , based on results for 34 galaxies .",
    "they suggested positive effects arise from accretion of the surrounding icm and/or stifling galactic winds by the icm pressure .",
    "however , osullivan et al . ( 2001 ) found no such correlation in a  analysis of 401 galaxies .",
    "recently , finoguenov & miniati ( 2004 ) claimed a positive effect of rich cluster environments on galaxy coronae based on  data of the coma cluster .",
    "their main argument is that the coronae are more luminous because of the compression by the icm pressure .",
    "our sample includes 157 early - type galaxies in 25 nearby hot clusters and unambiguously reveal the negative effects of environments on the size and gas mass of embedded coronae , as embedded coronae are smaller and contain less x - ray gas than coronae in poor environments . the negative effect on the @xmath203 relation of embedded coronae is also suggested by our results ( @xmath274.1 and @xmath274.2 ) . in fig . 5",
    ", we also derived a best fit lower than those from finoguenov & miniati ( 2004 ) and matsushita ( 2001 ) .",
    "however , we caution that reliable relations for coronae in poor environments need to be derived using  data for better comparison .",
    "if we examine the high end of the @xmath68 relation in detail ( fig .",
    "3 ) , we find that cd galaxies in high pressure environments ( e.g. , ngc  4874 and ngc  4889 in coma , the cds of a3558 and a4038 ) have systematically lower @xmath204 ( or the normalization of the best fit line in fig .",
    "3 ) than cd galaxies in lower pressure environments ( e.g. , ngc  6107 , ic  1633 , ngc  7720 , eso  137 - 006 and ngc  3842 ) .",
    "this trend is also against the positive environmental effects on the luminosities of coronae",
    ".    the limitations of  prevented any previous analysis from accurately determining the properties of thermal coronae in rich environments ( e.g. , as shown in @xmath274.1 ) .",
    "the accretion of the surrounding icm is only likely important for cds , while the icm around other cluster galaxies is not dense .",
    "in fact , even for cds of non - cooling core clusters in our sample , the cooling time of the surrounding icm is always longer than 3 gyr .",
    "the icm may stifle the galactic wind . however , any low density galactic winds will be easily stripped out of the galaxy as the velocity dispersion in hot clusters is very high ( 1000 - 2300 km / s in our sample ) . the argument of coronal density enhancement by icm pressure ( finoguenov & miniati 2004 )",
    "also does not hold for luminous embedded coronae , as the internal thermal pressure gradient inside these coronae is high .",
    "for example , the central gas pressures in ngc  3842 , ngc  3837 and ngc  1265 are 20 - 30 times the gas pressures at their boundaries .",
    "the icm pressure has little effect on the dense cores of coronae , while the outskirts contribute little to the total luminosity .",
    "even for coronae with flat density profiles , the compression will only happen on the leading edge , while the sides and likely the back will be stripped .",
    "the effect of ambient pressure on the coronal luminosity thus depends on the initial internal pressure gradient of coronae and the detailed stripping process .",
    "although a moderate pressure may enhance density at the front ( e.g. , ngc  4552 in virgo , machacek et al .",
    "2006 ; david et al .",
    "2006 ) , as the gas content and the size of coronae have been significantly reduced by the stripping , the x - ray luminosity should eventually decrease , as we have observed .",
    "we have also examined the enclosed x - ray luminosity as a function of radius for two representative nearby coronae in the poor environments , ngc  4697 and ngc  1404 ( fig .",
    "the properties of ngc  4697 are from sarazin et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , while those of ngc  1404 are from our own analysis .",
    "for flat coronae with small @xmath59 like ngc  4697 , most x - ray emission is from large radii .",
    "when such coronae move into hot clusters , the outskirts , where most of the x - ray gas mass resides , will be quickly removed . although density enhancement may occur along the leading edge , the x - ray luminosity eventually should greatly decrease . on the other hand , the luminosities of luminous coronae with a dense cooling core",
    "are less affected by stripping .",
    "if ngc  1404 falls into a hot cluster and stripping reduces its size to 2 kpc , the x - ray bolometric luminosity is only reduced by 50% to be @xmath205 ergs s@xmath6 , which will make ngc  1404 ( @xmath206 ) similar to pgc  018313 in a3376 ( table 2 ) .",
    "we also show the profile of ngc  1265 s corona ( extrapolated to 10 kpc radius ) in fig .",
    "it is very concentrated because ngc  1265 s corona is small ( @xmath13 2 kpc radius ) and its surface brightness profile is steep close to the boundary ( sjj05 ) .",
    "we observed a variety of x - ray components centered on the cd galaxies in our cluster sample , as shown in fig .",
    "there are clearly at least four classes :    * cd filled with hot diffuse icm , without a cooling core or a cool corona ( a2147 ) * a small cool corona of the cd embedded in the hot icm ( coma , a1060 , a3627 , 3c129.1 , a1367 , mkw8 , zw1615 + 35 , a576 , a3376 and a3558 ) * a larger distinctive cool x - ray component associated with the cd , embedded in the hotter icm ( a2877 and a2634 ) * a big cluster cooling core ( centaurus , awm7 , perseus , ophiuchus , a2199 , a496 , a2052 , mkw3s and a4059 )    a2147 is a non - cooling core cluster . over the course of the lifetime of its cd galaxy",
    ", over 10@xmath207 m@xmath9 ism gas should have been injected into the galaxy .",
    "the corona of its cd galaxy must have been destroyed and mixed with the icm . on the other hand , from the large number of clusters in the second class it seems that most coronae of the cd galaxies can survive until probably a cluster cooling core begins to form .",
    "the central x - ray component in a2107 is bigger and hotter than those of a2877 and a2634 .",
    "a2107 may then lie between the class three and four .",
    "both a4038 and a3571 have a high density gas core and a short central cooling time ( @xmath13 1.3 gyr ) .",
    "however , no temperature decline towards the center has been observed in both clusters .",
    "we consider that their gas cores may either have been re - heated , or still in the early stage of cooling core formation .",
    "therefore , they may be more similar to the class four clusters than other classes .",
    "we also noticed that the luminosities of the central radio sources do not appear to relate to the x - ray luminosities of the central cool component .",
    "the radio source in a496 , embedded in a big cluster cooling core , is 80 times fainter than the radio source associated with the small corona of eso  137 - 006 .",
    "most clusters in our sample either belong to the class two or the class four , which implies that the cd galaxies spend most of time in these two stages .",
    "this variety of x - ray components centered on the cd galaxy needs to be fitted into our understanding of cluster evolution , especially the evolution of the cluster gas core .",
    "our results indicate that coronae of massive galaxies are very common in hot clusters , which implies approximate energy and gas balance inside coronae .",
    "however , these embedded dense coronae also have short cooling time .",
    "the mass deposition rate from cooling is @xmath208@xmath209 ( @xmath210 ergs s@xmath6 ) ( @xmath2/0.9 kev)@xmath6 m@xmath9/yr .",
    "thus , the cooling timescale for a typical corona is : 0.22 ( @xmath211/10@xmath8 m@xmath9 ) ( @xmath2/0.9 kev ) ( @xmath70/10@xmath157 ergs s@xmath6)@xmath6 gyr , while the expected lifetime is an order of magnitude higher .",
    "the stellar mass loss rate within coronae of massive galaxies can be substantial , 0.3 - 0.6 ( @xmath212 ) m@xmath9/yr , assuming an enclosed stellar light fraction of 20% - 40% . as long as stripping",
    "is largely suppressed at the boundary ( @xmath277.1 ) , the fraction of the stellar mass loss rate required to balance the mass lost by stripping is not large ( @xmath13 20% ) .",
    "however , as shown in @xmath274.2 , the total energy release from the stellar mass loss is too small to balance cooling . moreover , as the stellar kinetic temperature is generally lower than the gas temperature ( @xmath274.5 ) , the coronal gas can not be heated by the stellar mass loss .",
    "therefore , another heat source is required to offset cooling for coronae of massive galaxies to explain their ubiquity and other properties .",
    "the problem for these embedded mini cooling cores is similar to that in big cluster cooling cores , where cooling needs to be offsetted by heating .",
    "while agn has generally be considered as the primary heat source in cluster cooling cores , agn heating may be too powerful for these embedded coronae .",
    "the central smbhs do not know where they are , if the accretion is determined by the gas properties close to the smbhs ( e.g. , within the bondi radius , which is generally smaller than 0.1 kpc ) .",
    "indeed , many radio sources , as powerful as those in cluster cooling cores , have been found to originate from embedded coronae ( @xmath274.4 ) . as we argued in s05 , sjj05 and @xmath274.4 , coronae associated with strong radio sources",
    "should not be much heated by central agn as the jet power can easily destroy the coronae and unbind the gas .",
    "jets may just penetrate the coronae with little energy dissipation .",
    "we indeed notice that some radio sources can disturb the surrounding gas within several kpc radius significantly and gas distribution is very asymmetric ( e.g. , m84 , finoguenov & jones 2001 ; m87 , forman et al .",
    "however , if this happens for a small corona in a high pressure environment , the radio source may easily destroy the corona or alter the density distribution to make coronae vulnerable to stripping in certain directions .",
    "even if we assume weak agn can offset cooling and not destroy coronae in some cases , it may be unavoidable to conclude that some coronae have already been destroyed by agn as the radio power of the agn spans a very wide range .",
    "it is then difficult to reconcile the facts of ubiquity of embedded coronae and the possible high frequency of agn bursts ( with a duty cycle of e.g. , @xmath213 yr ) .",
    "therefore , a gentle heat source is required .",
    "there are at least two possible such heat sources .",
    "the first one is the reduced icm heat flux through the coronal boundary .",
    "this was first suggested for ngc  4874 ( v01 ) , as there is a temperature gradient inside the corona .",
    "this mechanism requires a largely suppressed but not zero heat conductivity across the coronal boundary .",
    "the suppression factor can be estimated from the ratio of the heat flux and the x - ray luminosity of the corona ( e.g. , @xmath277.2 ) .",
    "as the reduced heat flux ( proportional to the surface area of the corona ) drops much more quickly than the cooling with radius , a balance radius at 1 - 4.5 kpc can always be achieved for heat conductivity reduced by a factor of 50 - 400 . however , as examined in v01 and s05 , this mechanism requires a heat conductivity as high as the spitzer value interior to the coronae . as we argued in @xmath277.2 ,",
    "the coronal gas is magnetized .",
    "therefore , it is unclear whether such a high heat conductivity can be achieved inside coronae .",
    "moreover , as shown in fig .",
    "9 , the temperature profiles of ngc  6109 and ngc  3837 are flat .",
    "any icm heat flux crossing the corona / icm boundary may not be re - distributed in at least these two coronae .",
    "another heat source is the kinetic energy of sne . as shown in fig .",
    "4 , the sne inside coronae ( enclosing @xmath13 30% of the total stellar mass ) generally have enough energy to balance cooling , if the sn kinetic energy can be efficiently coupled into the coronal gas . we have used the sn rate in early - type galaxies by cappellaro et al . ( 1999 ) , 0.166 h@xmath214 per 100 yr per 10@xmath207 l@xmath215 , and assumed a kinetic energy of 10@xmath216 ergs per sn .",
    "the requested efficiency ranges from @xmath13 20% for 0.7  galaxies , to @xmath13 40% for 2  galaxies , to 100% for most luminous galaxies .",
    "however , studies of the @xmath26 relation for coronae in poor environments ( e.g. , canizares et al . 1987 ; brown & bregman 1998 ) indicate that the sn kinetic energy is poorly coupled into the coronal gas , especially for x - ray faint coronae .",
    "most of the sn kinetic energy is probably used to drive galactic winds , which have a low density and are x - ray dim .",
    "the question is then where the sn energy can go in embedded coronae .",
    "the energy transfered to cosmic rays may not be strong as the sn blastwaves in 10@xmath19 k coronal gas can only be weak shocks .",
    "the evolution of supernova remnants ( snrs ) in the x - ray coronae of early - type galaxies has been examined by mathews ( 1990 ) . with the typical gas properties of luminous coronae in our sample , the sn - blown bubbles are generally @xmath28 10 pc in radius .",
    "the lifetime of these buoyant bubbles is also short as rayleigh - taylor and kelvin - holmholtz instabilities grow quickly .",
    "therefore , sne in dense coronae may only be able to deposit their kinetic energy locally , to offset cooling .",
    "however , if a single sn can only heat locally , the integrated sn heating should follow the optical light profile , which is flatter than the x - ray light profile of embedded luminous coronae ( fig .",
    "4 of s05 ; fig . 2 of sjj05 ) . therefore ,",
    "even if the sn kinetic energy is sufficient to balance cooling globally , gas cooling in the center may be unavoidable .",
    "buoyant bubbles from sne transfer more energy to the outskirts and can not help to heat the center .",
    "strong cooling at the very center may not be a problem as long as heating can offset a large portion of cooling globally .",
    "moreover , strong cooling at the very center may be required to fuel the central smbh and trigger radio sources .",
    "now we have a toy model set to explain the longevity of these embedded coronae and the energy balance of these mini cooling cores in hot clusters .",
    "the strong evaporation is greatly suppressed by the magnetic field at the boundary , which may also help to significantly suppress stripping through surface instabilities .",
    "stellar mass loss in the boundary layer can balance the mass lost from the suppressed stripping and the balance is stable . inside the corona , radiation loss",
    "is largely offsetted by heating from the kinetic energy of sne .",
    "cooling may still happen at the very center and is responsible for triggering the activity of the central smbh .",
    "the gas mass dropped out from the x - ray phase can be replenished by the stellar mass loss .",
    "the detailed modeling of the internal energy balance of embedded coronae is however beyond the scope of this paper .    what is the fate of these embedded coronae of early - type galaxies ?",
    "although they can survive even in environments as dense as the center of the coma cluster , it is unlikely that they can survive if passing through a dense cluster cooling core ( @xmath3 0.01 @xmath11 ) with a high velocity . however , the volume of such a dense cluster core ( generally @xmath55 100 kpc radius ) is tiny , compared with the volume of the whole cluster ( with a radius of several mpc ) .",
    "the fate of coronae then depends on the orbit of the galaxy .",
    "the coronae of cd galaxies may eventually mix with the icm when cluster cooling cores begin to form .",
    "we have systematically searched for and investigated thermal coronae of 179 galaxies ( both early and late types ) in 25 nearby ( @xmath1 0.05 ) , hot ( @xmath0 3 kev ) clusters , based on 68  archival pointings with a total exposure of 2.77 msec and a sky coverage of 3.3 deg@xmath35 .",
    "the galaxy sample is complete for all nir luminous ( @xmath3 0.74 in the @xmath43 band ) or radio luminous ( @xmath217 w hz@xmath6 ) galaxies in the  field .",
    "this work represents the first systematic study of x - ray thermal emission of galaxies in rich environments .",
    "the main observational results and conclusions of our study are :    \\1 ) we find a new population of embedded x - ray coronae of early - type galaxies in hot clusters . despite the effects of icm stripping , evaporation , rapid cooling , and powerful smbh bursts , x - ray coronae of massive early - type galaxies ( excluding cds in cluster cooling cores ) are very common ( @xmath3 60% of @xmath3 2  galaxies in the @xmath43 band ) in hot clusters , although their properties have been significantly modified by the dense icm .",
    "significant number of coronae have also been found in less massive galaxies ( @xmath3 40% of  @xmath55 @xmath218 2  galaxies ; @xmath3 15% of @xmath55  galaxies ) , although the  data of most clusters are not deep enough to unambiguously identify faint coronae ( @xmath219 ergs s@xmath6 ) .",
    "these embedded coronae are smaller ( generally 1.5 - 4 kpc in radius ) and contain less gas ( 10@xmath220 m@xmath9 ) than their counterparts in poor environments . the negative effect on the coronal luminosity is also suggested by the data",
    ". these embedded coronae may correspond to the dense cores of coronae in poor environments .",
    "therefore , our work has demonstrated the negative environmental effects of rich environments on galaxy coronae .",
    "the ubiquity of embedded coronae in massive galaxies implies a lifetime comparable to that of clusters ( or at least several gyr ) .",
    "\\2 ) the temperatures of embedded coronae range from 0.3 to 1.7 kev .",
    "the gas temperature is generally higher than the stellar kinetic temperature of the galaxy ( @xmath161 = 0.2 - 1.1 , fig . 8) .",
    "internal temperature profiles of embedded coronae generally show a decrease of gas temperature towards the center .",
    "the abundance of the coronal gas , constrained from the joint data of 20 coronae with best statistics , is @xmath13 0.8 solar , which implies a stellar origin of the coronal gas .",
    "\\3 ) for the cool coronae of early - type galaxies to survive in the hot icm , heat conduction across the boundary of the coronae has to be suppressed by a factor of @xmath10 100 .",
    "we argue that this fact implies the x - ray gas in early - type galaxies is magnetized .",
    "magnetic field plays an important role in energy transfer .",
    "however , it is unclear how the galactic magnetic field can remain disconnected from the field in the icm for the lifetime of embedded coronae .",
    "\\4 ) the embedded coronae of early - type galaxies are subject to icm stripping .",
    "the internal thermal pressure of coronae is generally high enough to overcome the ram pressure .",
    "however , the stripping through transport processes ( viscosity or turbulence ) at the coronal boundary is too strong and has to be suppressed by at least a factor of ten",
    ". the stellar mass loss in the boundary layer can balance the mass lost from the suppressed stripping and the balance is stable .",
    "\\5 ) the embedded coronae of early - type galaxies have high gas densities ( @xmath13 0.3 @xmath11 at the center of luminous coronae ) so they are the mini version of big cluster cooling cores , with a boundary . as the prevalence of the coronae of massive galaxies implies a long lifetime ( @xmath10 several gyr ) , there must be a heat source inside these embedded mini cooling cores . while we argue that both agn and the stellar ejecta can not be the major heat source , sn heating inside coronae is a good candidate if its kinetic energy can be efficiently ( 20% - 100% ) couple into the coronal gas .",
    "\\6 ) we have observed a connection between these mini - cooling - cores and the radio activity of their host galaxies .",
    "radiative cooling of the coronal gas may provide fuel for the central smbh in environments where the amount of galactic cold gas is at a minimum .",
    "we have also found a general morphological anti - correlation of the radio jet emission and the x - ray coronae .",
    "the radio jets generally `` turn on '' after traversing the dense coronae .",
    "the embedded dense coronae may also provide cold gas for nuclear star formation , while the star formation in `` naked '' galaxies exposed to the hot icm may have been truncated .",
    "\\7 ) we have observed a variety of x - ray components associated with or centered on the cd galaxies in our sample , ranging from no cool component , to small cool coronae , to large x - ray cool cores , to big cluster cores .",
    "most clusters in our sample either have a small cool corona associated with the cd galaxy , or a big cluster cooling core centered on the cd galaxy .",
    "\\8 ) we also detected thermal coronae of at least 8 late - type galaxies ( sb or later ) from 22 galaxies in our sample .",
    "late - type galaxies with luminous x - ray thermal emission usually have substantial star formation activity . in four galaxies with the most x - ray luminous coronae in the sample ,",
