    "the first - generation stars born in the early universe are thought to have no , or few heavy elements .",
    "they might play an important role for chemical evolution of the early universe .",
    "the initial mass function for the first generation stars has not been definitively determined yet . however",
    ", a lack of heavy elements leads to a deficiency of the coolants in the star - formation stage and hence to an expectation that very massive stars might have been formed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite suggested that very massive stars might experience vibrational instability in the core hydrogen - burning stage . in case of very massive stars ,",
    "influence of radiation pressure makes the effective ratio of specific heat , @xmath2 , close to 4/3 .",
    "then pulsation amplitude in the core becomes comparable with that in the envelope .",
    "this situation is favorable for instability due to the @xmath1-mechanism since excitation by this mechanism in the core can exceed flux dissipation in the envelope .",
    "many authors have analyzed the stability of very massive stars and proposed the critical mass above which the instability occurs . with the pure electron scattering opacity",
    "the radial fundamental mode becomes unstable in case of @xmath3 @xcite , while with the recent opal opacity table @xcite the critical mass is @xmath4 for the solar metallicity @xcite .",
    "in the latter case , the fundamental mode is excited mainly by the @xmath5-mechanism of the metallic absorption rather than the @xmath1-mechanism .    in the zero - metallicity case , however , the metallic absorption never occurs .",
    "@xcite analyzed the stability of population iii very massive stars and found that the fundamental mode becomes unstable due to the @xmath1-mechanism for stars with @xmath6 .",
    "population iii very massive stars might have released a significant amount of heavy elements by supernova explosions and contributed to the chemical evolution of the early universe .",
    "the stars with @xmath7 experience the core - collapse supernova explosion at the end of their life , while those with @xmath8 the pair - instability supernova explosion @xcite .",
    "in addition , the former stars leave intermediate mass black holes , for which several candidates have been found as ultraluminous x - ray sources @xcite",
    ". then , the evolution of the very massive stars is very important for the above phenomena , and have been investigated by several groups ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this paper , we focused on the vibrational stability of their evolution , and extended the @xcite s analysis toward the more massive stars .",
    "that is , we constructed the stellar models with @xmath9 and carried out the linear nonadiabatic analysis against radial and nonradial oscillations .",
    "we adopted a henyey - type code developed by @xcite and @xcite to calculate the stellar evolution .",
    "we constructed zero - metallicity models with 500 , 1000 and 3000 @xmath10 during the core hydrogen - burning stage .",
    "these stars were calculated without considering mass loss . _",
    "overshooting is not taken into account in this study . _    for the zero - metallicity stars , the only possible way of starting hydrogen burning is the pp - chain no matter how massive the star is .",
    "hence , the temperature near the stellar centre is much higher than in the case of metal - riched stars . during the pre ",
    "main - sequence stage , gravitational contraction releases energy so that the energy equilibrium in the whole star can be kept .",
    "when the central temperature reaches @xmath11 k , the pp - chain is activated and becomes to release enough energy to stop the gravitational contraction for stars with @xmath12 . for the more massive stars ,",
    "however , the gravitational contraction can not be stopped only by the pp - chain burning @xcite .",
    "when the central temperature reaches @xmath13 k , the triple alpha reaction produces enough @xmath14c to activate the cno cycle and then the contraction stops .",
    "thus , the main energy source for core hydrogen - burning of population iii massive stars is the cno cycle .",
    "table [ tab:1 ] shows property of the equilibrium models for the zams stage , which we define as the time when the gravitational contraction stops .",
    "the central temperature is hardly different among the different mass models and correponds to the occurence of the triple alpha reaction . due to the large nuclear energy generation ,",
    "the convective core is very large and occupies @xmath15 90 per cent of the stellar mass .",
    ".property of zero - metallicity zams models .",
    "[ tab:1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     from left to right the table entries read : stellar mass , duration of vibrationally unstable phase , mass - loss rate for the model marked with the open circles in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , total amount of the mass loss and convective core mass at the evolutionary stage when the instability disappears .",
    "the very massive stars have significantly large convective cores . if the mass loss is so strong that the stellar surface would become close to the top of the convective core , the cno - elements produced by the triple alpha reaction and the cno cycle will reach the surface by the convective mixing .",
    "this could cause the radiative mass loss to become efficient .",
    "for the stars with @xmath0 , the convective core occupies @xmath16 per cent of the stellar mass at the zams stage ( table [ tab:1 ] ) , but monotonically decreases during the core hydrogen burning stage .",
    "then , the mass fraction of the convective core becomes less than 70 per cent at the evolutionary stage when the instability disappears ( table [ tab:3 ] ) .",
    "thus the amount of the mass loss in our result is not enough to trigger the above situation . for the more massive stars",
    ", however , the convective core and amount of mass loss are expected to be larger .",
    "besides , although the instability disappears due to increase in the density contrast as discussed in section [ sec:4.1 ] , the stronger mass loss could maintain the vibrational instability by limiting the density contrast , like models of wolf - rayet stars shown in @xcite .",
    "then , it is worth analyzing if the above situation occurs for stars with @xmath17 .",
    "we have analyzed the vibrational stability of the main - sequence stage of population iii @xmath0 stars against the radial and non - radial modes .",
    "we found that only the radial fundamental mode becomes unstable due to the @xmath1-mechanism .",
    "the instability appears just after the pre  main - sequence contraction stops and the nuclear energy generation becomes large enough to maintain the energy equilibrium , while it disappears in the middle part of the core hydrogen burning stage as the density contrast between the inner and outer parts of the stars becomes larger .",
    "the other radial and non - radial modes never become unstable since the amplitude in the envelope is much larger than in the core . unfortunately , the result contains uncertainty due to the large convective core .",
    "improvement in our knowledge about the convection - pulsation interaction is required to obtain a definite conclusion on the stability analysis .    to measure the significance of the instability , we estimated the amount of mass loss due to the instability by adopting the @xcite method , although non - linear analysis was actually necessary .",
    "we found that the amount is less than 10 per cent of the whole stellar mass .",
    "thus , we conclude that mass loss due to this instability , by itself , is not significant for the later evolution . however , we note that @xcite suggested that the radiative mass loss is supposed to siginificantly affect the evolution of the population iii very massive stars with @xmath18 .",
    "@xcite showed that rotational models of population iii stars favour the surface enrichment of the heavy elements due to rotational mixing processes , which might trigger stronger radiative mass loss .",
    "then , the effect of the vibrational instability should be combined with the above effects for more exact investigation of the evolution .",
