    "according to the standard picture , the structure we observe today in our universe formed as a consequence of the growth of fluctuations in the primordial dark matter distribution which gravitationally attracted gaseous baryonic matter that later settled into disk galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "galaxy mergers within halos subsequently transformed disks into bulges and the gas fell to the center , triggering starbursts and feeding the rapid growth of black holes ( bh ) .",
    "these in turn responded by feeding energy back to the surrounding gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this picture of structure formation is based on observational work which , over the past few decades , indicates that most -if not all- _ massive _ galaxies with a spheroidal component have a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) at their center ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , estimates of the bh masses of these giant galaxies have been found to tightly correlate with the spheroid / host luminosity ( or stellar mass ) and also with the stellar velocity dispersion within the host bulges ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .    however , there is growing evidence that smbh not only exist at the centers of massive galaxies with a central bulge , but also at the centers of galaxies with pseudo - bulges and that these systems also exhibit a correlation between black hole mass and total stellar mass @xcite .",
    "this supports the alternative view that smbh growth might be due to minor mergers and/or secular processes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although , as pointed out by @xcite , the main channel of pseudo - bulge formation may in fact not be secular disk evolution but rather rapid gas supply at high - redshift .    given the uncertainties concerning the current understanding of the formation of bulges and pseudo - bulges in galaxies , the problem of identifying the main process at play in the formation of smbh at the centers of galaxies with a spheroidal component remains a difficult challenge at present .",
    "on the other hand , the recent discovery of a smbh at the center of henize 2 - 10 @xcite , a dwarf starburst galaxy lacking any substantial spheroidal component , suggests that a merger is not essential to making a smbh and that bh growth may after all require substantial and ongoing secular processes , at least in these galaxies .",
    "indeed , recent theoretical developments on the formation of the first massive bh show that they may form out of gas - dynamical instability at low metallicity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . moreover , if smbh are also generic to bulgeless galaxies and dwarf galaxies , as indeed the current work will present evidence to demonstrate they are , these galaxy types may offer the best probe of smbh formation and evolution in the local universe . in this regard ,",
    "a smbh hosted by a bulgeless galaxy and/or dwarf galaxy is more likely `` pristine '' , as it is unlikely that it has experienced mergers and dynamical interactions but has rather undergone a quieter evolution .",
    "moreover , pure - disk galaxies are far from rare : locally , only four of the nineteen giant galaxies are ellipticals or have classical bulges @xcite . while in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , based on the quantitative morphological analysis of 1.12 million galaxies in the data release seven ( dr7 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the fraction of galaxies with an optical srsic profile index @xmath0 and bulge fraction @xmath1 , i.e.  nearly bulgeless , is @xmath214% ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ) .",
    "however , despite the large fraction of bulgeless galaxies and their clear importance in challenging our current understanding of galaxy formation and evolution , a systematic survey of smbhs in bulgeless galaxies has never been undertaken , though this is in part due to the lack of a well - defined sample . in this paper",
    ", we attempt to rectify this situation and substantially extend the status of the present knowledge of smbh and their host galaxies by presenting the first systematic survey of smbhs in galaxies of all morphological types , i.e.  including those classified as bulgeless galaxies , based on the quantitative morphological analysis of 1.12 million galaxies in the sdss dr7 .    in this work",
    "we report the results of two separate studies which explore the nature of smbh and their host galaxies , the first based on an x - ray / radio selected sample and the second on an infrared selected sample .",
    "the structure of our paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : quantitative ] , we describe the method that we used to select our sample of morphologically classified galaxies . in section  [ sec : xray ] , we present the selection and analysis of our x - ray / radio selected sample of active smbh , while in section  [ sec : infrared ] , we present the selection and analysis of our infrared selected sample of active smbh . in section  [ sec : summary ] , we summarize our results . considered together , we believe these two studies are complementary in nature , in that while our first analysis of an x - ray selected sample provides a well - tested and robust estimate of black hole mass but with a small statistic , our second analysis of an infrared selected sample provides estimates on the black hole mass , parametrised by their accretion efficiency , but with a large statistic",

    "in addition to the canonical de vaucouleurs bulge ( srsic index @xmath6 ) + exponential disk fitting model , two other fitting models were used .",
    "the first additional model was a free @xmath7 bulge + disk model , with @xmath7 allowed to vary from 0.5 to 8 , and the second one was a single component pure srsic model , with @xmath8 also allowed to vary from 0.5 to 8 .",
    "the appropriate model was selected using the f - test probability @xmath9 and the uncertainties associated with the best fit parameters were estimated from the 99% confidence limits ( table 1 - 3 , ; * ? ? ?",
    "in order to classify a galaxy as bulgeless , we required an optical srsic profile index @xmath0 and a bulge fraction @xmath10 .",
    "for the whole catalog , this yielded a list of 88,594 galaxies , corresponding to about 14% of the total sample .",
    "as shown by @xcite , the ability of the quantitative code to recover bulges is limited by the resolution of the images , in this case 1.2 arcsec . for a typical bulge of size 3  kpc",
    ", quantitative methods can recover bulges in the sdss images to a redshift of about 0.06 . assuming a size distribution that is gaussian",

    "only 8% of these galaxies fall below @xmath11 . from this",
    "we conclude that the number of bulgeless galaxies we have identified may be an overestimate as , with higher resolution images , we are likely to find bulges in the large fraction of these galaxies at @xmath12 .",
    "in our first analysis , which we now describe , we investigated the properties of a sample of galaxies containing agn selected via their x - ray detection . in order to achieve this purpose we utilized the chandra source catalog / sloan digital sky survey ( csc - sdss ; * ? ? ? * ) cross - match catalogue to select active black holes via their x - ray emission .",
    "the x - ray color ( or hardness ratio ) , often used to identify agn , was left unconstrained in this selection process in order to avoid filtering out some agn candidates , as , for example , many of the brightest x - ray sources are identified as agn candidates by the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ; * ? ? ?",

    "finally , after applying our selection criteria of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we were left with a sample of 26 galaxies classed as bulgeless .      in order to gain some insight into the nature of our of x - ray selected sample of 688 galaxies with structural parameters , we examined their redshift and structural parameter distributions and compared them to the general population .",
    "the redshift distribution of the x - ray selected sample has been plotted in figure  [ fig : hist_z_xray ] , while the distributions in srsic index , bulge fraction and bulge srsic index are depicted in figure  [ fig : hist_ngbtr_xray ] .",
    "the srsic profile index was plotted only for galaxies better fitted with a srsic model , i.e.  with an f - test probability @xmath13 , whereas both the bulge fraction and the bulge srsic index were plotted only for galaxies better fitted with a bulge + disk components model , in this case with @xmath14 .",
    "the shape of the redshift distribution was found to be similar to that of ( see figure  [ fig : hist_z_xray ] ) , with a peak at @xmath15 , indicating no obvious redshift bias in the x - ray sample .",

    "similarly , the distribution in bulge fraction was also found to show a deficit of @xmath17 as compared to the general population ( see figure  [ fig : hist_ngbtr_xray ] ) . taken together ,",

    "importantly for us , considered only sources classified as galaxies both photometrically and spectroscopically by the sdss , i.e.  sources with photoobj.type = 3 and specobj.specclass = 2 .",
    "a key consequence of the nature of this selection was that it should have had the effect of filtering out most of the unobscured ( type 1 ) agn , i.e.  those showing broad emission lines .",
    "crucially , this implies that our final sample possessing stellar masses , obtained from the catalog of , both for this analysis and the analysis in section  [ sec : infrared ] , should have been composed mainly of obscured ( type 2 ) agn .",
    "although , this might be viewed as a restriction , as ideally one would like to have a sample composed of both types of agn , there are two immediate benefits to having a sample composed of type 2 agn .",
    "the first is that this provides an opportunity to study smbhs in type 2 agn on a large scale . the second benefit of obtaining such a sample is that one can expect a minimal contribution from obscured agn to the total optical light in these galaxies , and hence , a negligible effect from the agn optical light to the estimates of their stellar masses .",
    "the stellar masses obtained by were derived via the fit of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of sdss @xmath20 photometry with the flexible stellar population synthesis code of @xcite . for our selected sample of bulgeless galaxies",

    "based on monte carlo simulations , the uncertainties in stellar mass are estimated to be 0.04 and 0.15 dex for the single- and two - component fits , respectively .",
    "of the 688 galaxies in our x - ray / morphology sample , we were able to match 404 galaxies with the catalog and get their stellar masses .      to compute an estimate of the black hole mass for our x - ray sample",
    ", we appealed to the fundamental plane of black hole activity @xcite , which correlates the x - ray and radio luminosities with the mass of the black hole .    in order to search for the level of radio emission from the detected chandra x - ray sources in our galaxy sample",
    ", we utilized the source catalog produced by the national radio observatory / very large array ( nrao / vla ) sky survey ( nvss ) .",
    "this radio survey was undertaken by the nrao vla telescope and covered the sky north of a declination of -40 degrees , at a frequency of 1.4 ghz , a resolution of 45 \" and a limiting peak source brightness of about 2.5 mjy / beam .",
    "of the 404 sources that we had previously identified as having been assigned a stellar mass in the catalog , we managed to find 8 that also had an nvss radio detection , one of which we identified as bulgeless .",
    "the stellar masses of our final 8 galaxies are given in table  [ tbl : tbl-1 ] , while their morphological parameters are listed in table  [ tbl : tbl-2 ] .",
    "we note that the galaxy 587724199889666262 can also be found in the 2mass - selected flat galaxy catalog of @xcite .",
    "the empirical relationship relating black hole mass to the emitted compact radio and hard x - ray luminosities , spanning nine orders of magnitude in black hole mass , is formalized by the equation @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the radio luminosity at 5  ghz in erg / s , @xmath24 is the 2 - 10 kev x - ray luminosity in erg / s , and @xmath25 is the mass of the black hole in solar masses .",

    "black hole masses were estimated using the bolometric luminosity of the galaxies .",
    "bolometric luminosities ( taken to be the 100 micron to 10 kev integrated luminosity * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are typically obtained using corrections to the mid - infrared bands where the agn emission dominates .",
    "we used the 12 ( w3 ) and 22 micron ( w4 ) k - corrected flux densities from wise to compute the bolometric luminosities of our wise color - selected agn and applied the bolometric corrections @xmath32 ( w3 ) and @xmath33 ( w4 ) from @xcite , which are not strongly dependent on agn luminosity ( see their figure  12 ) .",
    "given the bolometric luminosity , making the assumption that accretion is at the eddington limit yields a lower limit on the black hole mass .",
    "however , given that the growth rates of agn can span several orders of magnitude , from super - eddington accretion to @xmath34 @xcite , we computed black hole masses assuming the following three cases : @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "the histogram of bh masses ( @xmath35 ) is shown in figure  [ fig : hist_mstartotbhmass ] ( right ) .",
    "the black hole masses range from @xmath38  to @xmath39  with a peak near @xmath40 .",
    "these numbers are consistent with those measured in the sample of @xcite ( @xmath38  to @xmath41 ) given our larger sample size .",
    "however , they are statistically lower than the masses measured from our x - ray / radio sample .    using the stellar masses of @xcite and the black hole masses estimated from the bolometric luminosity of the galaxies , we present the correlation between black hole mass and total stellar mass for our sample of 6,247 galaxies , including the 530 classified as bulgeless in figure  [ fig : bhmass_mstartot ] ( left ) .",
    "here , we only show the results based on the 22 micron luminosities , although the results based on the 12 micron luminosities are very similar .    the first thing to note is that the results of using our new method of selecting agn based on their infrared colors clearly confirm the strong correlation between the total stellar mass of galaxies and the mass of their smbhs .",
    "however importantly , whereas previous studies were limited to primarily bulge - dominated systems , our study confirms this relationship to _ all morphological types , in particular , to bulgeless galaxies _ ( figure  [ fig : bhmass_mstartot ] left , green crosses ) .",
    "additionally , we emphasize that this study is by far the largest sample to date .    in this figure ,",
    "the total stellar mass estimates for the bulgeless galaxies are from the srsic profile fitting ( figure  [ fig : bhmass_mstartot ] left , green crosses ) whereas the rest are from the de vaucouleurs bulge + exponential disk fitting ( figure  [ fig : bhmass_mstartot ] left , black dots ) . for reference to previous work done for classical bulges ,",
    "we show in the same figure the sample of galaxies with bulge srsic index @xmath42 ( figure  [ fig : bhmass_mstartot ] right , magenta crosses ) .",
    "it may be noted that the location of these galaxies in the diagram is almost indistinguishable from the bulgeless galaxies .",
    "a bisector linear regression fit to the data leads to the relation :    @xmath43    where @xmath44 and @xmath45 for @xmath46",
    ". this relation is plotted in figure  [ fig : bhmass_mstartot ] with a dashed line .",
    "the relations obtained using @xmath47 and @xmath48 are also shown for comparison with a dotted and solid line , respectively .    for comparison ,",
    "we have also shown in the same figure the empirical relation of @xcite ( where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and scatter of 0.3 dex , grey shaded region ) .",
    "although the slopes of the two fits are essentially the same , the agreement on the intercept depends on the value of @xmath51 . assuming that previous studies such as that of @xcite based on local dynamical mass estimates are correct , then our results appear to be most consistent with the black hole masses derived using @xmath46 .",
    "in fact , we expect this assumption to be the main source of uncertainty in our analysis , as the errors that arise from estimating the total stellar masses are on average @xmath20.15 dex and those from estimating the bolometric luminosity are on average @xmath20.20 dex , and hence can not account for such a shift .",
    "indeed , in this regard , @xcite point out that accretion may take place at well below the eddington limit and find that , at least for two sources in their sample , @xmath52 and 0.08 .",
    "hence , if a growth rate of order @xmath46 is typical of the sample , it implies that our black hole and total stellar mass relation is consistent with the empirical relation of @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : bhmass_mstarbulgedisk ] , we have plotted the results which essentially represent the galaxies in our sample with a significant bulge component , specifically those that do not satisfy the bulgeless selection criteria @xmath0 and @xmath53 . in figure",
    "[ fig : bhmass_mstarbulgedisk ] ( left ) we consider the bulge stellar mass only , while in figure  [ fig : bhmass_mstarbulgedisk ] ( right ) we consider the disk stellar mass only . in both figures scatter",
    "is significantly increased with respect to figure  [ fig : bhmass_mstartot ] , which uses the total stellar mass .",
    "this indicates that _ the true correlation is between the black hole mass and the total stellar mass_. this is confirmed when we consider the bulge - dominated galaxies only @xmath54 ) in figure  [ fig : bhmass_mstarbulgedisk ] ( left , red crosses ) , and the disk - dominated galaxies only @xmath55 ) ( right , blue crosses ) , and note that these exhibit significantly tighter correlations .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the previous assumption that the black hole mass was correlated with the bulge mass was only approximately correct , since the true relation is in fact with the total stellar mass of the galaxy .",
    "however , the approximate bulge mass correlation therefore becomes increasingly accurate as the bulge mass dominates the total mass of the galaxy .",
    "same as figure  [ fig : bhmass_mstartot ] , with galaxies divided in three redshift bins : @xmath56 ( _ blue _ ) , @xmath57 ( _ green _ ) , and @xmath58 ( _ red _ ) . ]    in figure  [ fig : bhmass_mstartot_z ] , we also provide a plot of the data sorted into three redshift bins : @xmath56 ( blue open circles ) , @xmath57 ( green open circles ) , and @xmath58 ( red open circles ) .",
    "comparing data at low redshift , it is entirely consistent with what is found based on local dynamical mass estimates . in this figure , there appears to be a deficit of low masses at high redshift .",
    "this redshift dependence is very likely due to the bias introduced by the limiting magnitudes of both the sdss and wise all - sky survey and not to any evolutionary effect .",
    "for instance , the minimum logarithm of the bh mass based on the flux limit of wise at 22 micron of 5.4 mjy ( 5@xmath59 ) and using @xmath60 is ( 5.0,7.0,7.7,8.0 ) at z=(0.01,0.1,0.2,0.3 ) , respectively .",
    "by using the quantitative morphological analysis of 1.12 million galaxies in the sdss dr7 , we have presented the first systematic survey of smbhs in galaxies of all morphological types , i.e.  including bulgeless galaxies .",
    "two different methods were used to identify the presence of black holes via their activity , the first being their x - ray / radio emission and the second their mid - infrared colors .",
    "these two studies are complementary in that while our first analysis of the x - ray selected sample is biased towards selecting unobscured agn and provides a well - tested and robust estimate of black hole mass but with a small statistic , our second analysis of the infrared selected sample includes both unobscured ( type 1 ) and obscured ( type 2 ) agn and provides estimates on the black hole mass but with a large statistic .",
    "our first analysis identified 688 unobscured active galaxies with known structural parameters .",
    "when the srsic profile index @xmath8 and bulge fraction @xmath61 of these galaxies were examined , we were able to identify 26 of these galaxies hosting a smbh as bulgeless .",
    "we were able to obtain estimates for both the stellar and black hole masses for 8 of these 688 galaxies and investigate their relationship .",
    "the results of this first analysis confirm the correlation between black hole and total stellar mass for these 8 galaxies and includes one galaxy classified as bulgeless .",
    "our second analysis identified 15,991 mostly obscured active galaxies with known structural parameters .",
    "when the srsic profile index and bulge fraction of this sample were examined , we were able to identify 1,450 bulgeless galaxies containing agn .",
    "moreover , when analyzing the full range of structural parameters , we found that these active galaxies followed a very similar morphological distribution to the general population of galaxies in the same redshift range . in particular , the fraction of bulgeless galaxies , @xmath2 9% , was found to be the same as in the general population . for this larger sample ,",
    "we were also able to obtain estimates of the total stellar and black hole masses for 6,247 galaxies and investigate their relationship . importantly , whereas previous studies were limited to primarily bulge - dominated systems , our study confirms this relationship to all morphological types , in particular , to 530 bulgeless galaxies .",
    "furthermore , we were able to investigate the same relationship using the independently estimated bulge and disk stellar masses .",
    "our results indicated that the true correlation is between the black hole mass and the total stellar mass and hence we concluded that the previous assumption that the black hole mass is correlated with the bulge mass was only approximately correct .",
    "if extrapolated , the combination of these results appear to indicate that smbhs are generic to galaxies regardless of the details of stellar galaxy evolution , dynamics and merger history of galaxies . as it is only possible to estimate dynamical masses locally",
    ", the future of studying smbhs in galaxies at all redshifts lies in a method such as the one presented in this work .",
    "an obvious extension of our analysis , to be presented in a future paper , will be to include unobscured agns .",
    "for these galaxies , where the nuclear emission is clearly visible , fitting an additional component to the two - dimensional light profile will be necessary , as the fitting models used in would underestimate the bulgeless fraction of the agn sample by overestimating the srsic index of the host component .",

    "<S> we present the results of a study of a statistically significant sample of galaxies which clearly demonstrate that supermassive black holes are generically present in all morphological types . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis is based on the quantitative morphological classification of 1.12 million galaxies in the sdss dr7 and on the detection of black hole activity via two different methods , the first one based on their x - ray / radio emission and the second one based on their mid - infrared colors . </S>",
    "<S> the results of the first analysis confirm the correlation between black hole and total stellar mass for 8 galaxies and includes one galaxy classified as bulgeless . </S>",
    "<S> the results of our second analysis , consisting of 15,991 galaxies , show that galaxies hosting a supermassive black hole follow the same morphological distribution as the general population of galaxies in the same redshift range . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the fraction of bulgeless galaxies , 1,450 galaxies or 9 percent , is found to be the same as in the general population . </S>",
    "<S> we also present the correlation between black hole and total stellar mass for 6,247 of these galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , whereas previous studies were limited to primarily bulge - dominated systems , our study confirms this relationship to all morphological types , in particular , to 530 bulgeless galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that the true correlation that exists for supermassive black holes and their host galaxies is between the black hole mass and the total stellar mass of the galaxy and hence , we conclude that the previous assumption that the black hole mass is correlated with the bulge mass is only approximately correct .    </S>",
