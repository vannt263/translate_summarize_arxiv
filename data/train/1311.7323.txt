    "in consideration of the success with interferometers for neutral atoms @xcite and molecules @xcite , efforts were made to expand the field towards matter wave experiments with ions .",
    "they started with the realization of the first biprism interferometer for helium ions by hasselbach et al . @xcite .",
    "the additional parameter charge combined with the internal structure of ions offer significant advantages in comparison to interferometers for electrons and neutral atoms .",
    "ion interferometers could open up the door for a class of novel quantum optical experiments to test the influence of inner structure in the magnetic aharonov - bohm effect @xcite or the first direct measurement of the electric aharonov - bohm effect @xcite .",
    "furthermore such a device may allow for interferometry experiments with laser excitation of inner ionic states @xcite , decoherence studies @xcite and might enable for extremely sensitive sensors for rotations and accelerations @xcite .",
    "+ however , in the first and only realization of an ion interferometer @xcite , the low helium ion brightness of the field ion source turned out to be the weak point of the design .",
    "very long exposure times of had to be taken into account to accumulate interference fringes and diffraction for he@xmath0 ions .",
    "for that reason further quantum optical experiments have not been possible . a second attempt to build an ion interferometer",
    "was made by krenn et al . @xcite .",
    "also in this device the low count rate of the ion source was the main challenge and prevented the successful generation of ion interferences . to solve this issue",
    "an alternative source needs to be applied .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that single atom tip ( sat ) field emitters generate coherent beams with high brightness for electrons and ions .",
    "+   + in this article we demonstrate for the first time the application of an iridium covered w(111 ) sat source in a biprism interferometer .",
    "the device is based on the setup of hasselbach et al .",
    "we analyze the electron interference pattern in this interferometer , characterize the performance of the sat emitter in a field ion and field electron microscope and compare it with other emitter types .",
    "furthermore , a new method to fabricate a coherent biprism beam splitter is presented .",
    "+ in conventional biprism electron or ion interferometers @xcite the source size and the biprism diameter are not known with high accuracy . in our setup",
    "these parameters are well defined within several nanometers .",
    "recently an electron beam from a sat source was diffracted and interfered on a carbon nanotube @xcite .",
    "although the high coherent properties of this source could be demonstrated , it is likely that this scheme can not be applied for ion interferometry , since the fringe pattern magnification was performed geometrically with a distance of several hundred nanometers between the tip and the nanotube . for ions the tip voltage needs to be higher and the distance to the nanotube shorter , which may cause arcing . in this context",
    "our setup has the advantage that the interference pattern is magnified by a quadrupole lens .",
    "furthermore the interference can be tuned by an adjustable potential on the biprism fiber , which is not possible in the nanotube approach .",
    "in biprism interferometry @xcite an ideally point - like electron or ion source illuminates coherently a biprism fiber . applying a positive ( for electrons ) or negative ( for ions ) potential on",
    "the wire leads to a separation and deflection of the matter wave .",
    "the beam paths combine again shortly after the biprism and interfere with each other . as a result",
    "an interference pattern parallel to the biprism wire can be detected in the plane of observation .",
    "the choice of the beam source with a highly coherent signal is crucial for an electron or ion biprism interferometer that should be capable of performing sophisticated future matter wave experiments .",
    "the lateral and longitudinal coherence length , the emission angle , the signal intensity and the spatial stability depend on the source . an established technique to produce",
    "a coherent electron beam is to etch a metal tip and set it on a high negative potential in vacuum until field emission starts . to generate an ion beam ,",
    "a positive voltage is applied to ionize and accelerate gas atoms at the tip end due to the high electric field .",
    "+ several different tip types have been developed in the last decades .",
    "the electron emission characteristics of four of them are listed in tab . [",
    "tab : comparison ] . in the first one , electrons are thermally emitted by a comparably blunt tungsten or lanthanum hexaboride ( lab@xmath1 ) tip and accelerated towards a counter electrode @xcite .",
    "the second type describes an etched tip where the electrons are extracted by field emission .",
    "the third one , the so called `` supertip '' , is an etched tip , where a tiny protrusion is created @xcite .",
    "this was the source in the first ion interferometer @xcite .",
    "due to its geometry , the emitted electron or ion matter wave experience a self focusing effect .",
    "an ion beam is emitted with a high angular confinement of about 2@xmath2 , instead of about 60@xmath2 full emission angle for etched tips @xcite without the protrusion .",
    "however , it was mentioned in @xcite for ion emission that this protrusion , being the emission center , is spatially only stable for about one hour , with a large uncertainty between different supertips .",
    "this is a disadvantage for the use in ion interferometry since the beam alignment before signal acquisition is typically longer than this time and the instability leads to uncorrelated phase shifts , destroying the contrast .",
    "also the maximal beam brightness of for ionization gas with a partial pressure of ( tab .",

    "a sketch of this tip is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tip ] .",
    "it consists of an etched single crystal ( 111 ) tungsten wire where a monolayer of iridium is deposited @xcite .",
    "after installation into ultrahigh vacuum , it is resistively heated several times to a temperature between and for . due to surface energy optimization",
    ", the tip forms a three - sided atom pyramid with a single iridium atom at the apex .",
    "as determined in @xcite , the nano - pyramid can be regenerated in vacuum over 50 times by annealing and the long time stability of these sat sources is extraordinary high .",
    "variations in the ion current of for helium and for hydrogen for about have been measured and they do not show any degradation after a total operation time of @xcite . as for the supertips , a self focusing effect limits the emission angle leading to a high beam brightness for helium ions of for ionization gas with a partial pressure of @xcite .",
    "the opening angle @xmath3 of a coherent emission can be assessed by the relation for the angular coherence constraint @xmath4 @xcite where @xmath5 is the source size and @xmath6 the de broglie wavelength of the particle .",
    "a sat field emitter yields the smallest source size possible .",
    "the emitting area is only a single atom , with a diameter of in case of an iridium covered sat @xcite .",
    "this results in a large @xmath3 and in a broad coherently illuminated area on the biprism and the detector .",
    "it is therefore well suited for electron as well as for ion interferometry with short de broglie wavelengths .",
    "the emission of an iridium covered w(111 ) sat was characterized after annealing and forming in the field electron / ion microscope @xcite illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : testsetup ] in the ultrahigh vacuum of .",
    "the tip temperature during annealing was measured through a window from outside the vacuum chamber by a disappearing filament pyrometer . to observe the electron field emission ,",
    "the tip was set on room temperature and on a voltage of .",
    "the resulting spatial distribution of the emission pattern after a distance of behind the tip was measured in a mcp detector with a fluorescent screen .",

    "this is in good agreement with measurements for a platinum covered sat from the literature with an electron emission angle of 5.6@xmath2 @xcite . increasing",
    "the voltage soon saturates the mcp detector .",
    "therefore it can be moved out of the beam path by a translation stage to be exchanged by a faraday cup .",
    "it collects the emitted electrons and the charge is read out by a picoamperemeter . with this device a fowler - nordheim plot @xcite , shown in fig .",

    "we recorded similar images also for hydrogen and neon ionization gas .",
    "the beam divergence is significantly smaller than for electrons .",
    "the measured spread is in perfect agreement with data from the literature for an iridium covered w(111 ) sat where an emission angle of 1.5@xmath2 was measured for helium at a tip temperature of and a voltage between 7 and @xcite .",
    "it needs to be noted that the ion emission voltage is strongly dependent on the diameter of the tungsten tip below the iridium layer ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tip ] ) and can vary by several kv for different tips as well as for the same tip after annealing to regenerate the single atom emission .",
    "+ in the cited literature @xcite the pyramidal atomic structure was verified by field evaporation of the upmost iridium atom . as a result",
    "it could be observed that the helium gas gets ionized by the three iridium atoms forming the second layer of the nano - pyramid .",
    "another field evaporation revealed the third layer with 10 iridium atoms visible in the field ion microscope . in the interpretation of our data we rely on these work and reason from the equivalence of our determined ion emission angle with the value in @xcite that we achieved single atom tip emission where only the topmost atom is the origin of the particle beam for ions and electrons .",
    "the electrostatic biprism is the second core element in the interferometer .",
    "it acts as a coherent beam splitter for the charged matter wave and requires to be electrically conducting . in electron and ion interferometers @xcite it usually has a surface roughness in the nanometer range and a diameter below .",
    "the former common technique to manufacture such thin wires was to manually draw a glass fiber out of a silica rod above a hydrogen - oxygen flame @xcite .",
    "the technique needed a lot of experience and could produce wires with typical diameters between 200 and @xcite .",
    "the drawback was the diameter variation of up to several hundred nanometers between different preparations .",
    "therefore , no exact information about the diameter was available , leading to an uncertainty that enters in the analysis of the interference data .",
    "a prior measurement of the diameter in a scanning electron microscope ( sem ) was not possible , since the biprism got contaminated with dust during the pumping procedures in the apparatus .",
    "if dust deposits get charged by the electron beam , they deform the interference pattern .    for that reason we developed a new biprism preparation procedure where a certain diameter can be chosen and reliably reproduced without further sem analysis of each newly created fiber .",
    "the method relies on a custom - built computer - controlled fiber - pulling rig @xcite . for the heat - and - pull process",
    "a standard optical fiber was attached on two linear translation stages and positioned above a hydrogen - oxygen flame with a stoichiometric gas mixture .",
    "the softened fiber was stretched and at the same time translated with respect to the flame along its axis . with",
    "that technique tapered optical fibers with pre - defined shape can be created @xcite . for the biprism beam splitter fabricated here this radius profile",
    "consists of a nanowire section with a homogeneous nominal diameter of and a length of that is linked to the unprocessed fiber ends by two tapered fiber sections .",
    "the corresponding nominal radius profile is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure_neu ] . using sem measurements",
    ", it was shown that the actually realized fiber - profiles deviate by less than from the intended design @xcite . with this technique",
    "it is possible to produce fibers with a diameter down to about @xcite .",
    "in order to test if this procedure can be applied for the creation of an interferometer biprism , two fibers were pulled as described and fixed on an u - shaped titanium mount with ultra - high vacuum compatible glue .",
    "thin layers of gold and a gold - palladium ( 60:40 ) alloy were subsequently deposited on the fibers with equal sputtering times . to prevent effects related to contact potentials ,",
    "the holders and the grounded electrodes were sputtered as well @xcite . to ensure a constant coverage on all sides of the biprism ,",
    "the probes were turned during the sputtering process .",
    "[ fig : fiber ] shows sem images of the resulting biprism wires .",
    "the diameters including the coatings inferred from these images are for gold and for gold - palladium . based on the nominal diameter of the silica nanowires of the layer thicknesses was estimated to be and , respectively .",
    "the uncertainty in these values are not identified .",
    "a low surface roughness is an important requirement for the biprism wire to be used as a beam splitter in interferometry , since irregularities lower the fringe contrast .",
    "as inferred from the image the gold - palladium alloy surface is clearly more smooth than the gold surface .      to demonstrate electron interference with the sat source , the setup illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] was used .",
    "the interferometer was constructed by hasselbach et al . @xcite and modified to be applied for this study .",
    "relevant changes concern the beam source , the biprism and the detector .",
    "the supertip beam source was replaced by a sat .",
    "the biprism beam splitter was exchanged by a fiber drawn according to the method described above . and the mcp detector with a phosphor screen and a ccd camera was substituted by a delay line detector .",
    "all parts are in a vacuum chamber with a pressure of . in the compact interferometer architecture @xcite",
    "all components are mounted on two rigid ceramic bars and the ion beam is aligned by three deflection electrodes .",
    "it is shielded against external electric and magnetic fields by a copper and a mu - metal tube .",
    "the electron source is an ir / w(111 ) sat @xcite that was prepared according to the procedure described above .",
    "it can be cooled by a liquid helium cryostat for future applications with ions .",
    "after the first deflection electrode for beam aligning the particles get detected by a movable mcp detector .",
    "this part together with a phosphor screen forms a field electron or field ion microscope @xcite which is important to observe the formation of the sat in the vacuum after annealing . with the help of a @xmath13{^\\circ}$ ] mirror",
    ", the screen can be seen through a side window in the chamber .",
    "the mcp detector can be moved out of the optical axis to align the beam onto the biprism by two further deflection electrodes .",
    "the biprism separates the beam coherently and overlaps the two partial waves .",
    "it is positioned in the middle between two grounded electrodes that are apart from each other .",
    "the wien filter @xcite consists of two magnetic coils in combination with two electrodes .",
    "it is able to correct the longitudinal wave package shift caused by the aligning deflectors if the beam path does not perfectly match the optical axis .",
    "after the partial matter waves combine , they form an interference pattern which is oriented along the @xmath14-axis of the quadrupole lenses by the image rotator .",
    "it is a coil inducing a magnetic field parallel to the direction of the beam propagation .",
    "the quadrupole lenses magnify the image in the @xmath15-direction by a factor up to 10@xmath16 @xcite to fit the detectors resolution of about . at the end the particles get detected by a combination of a double - stage mcp and a delay line anode @xcite .",
    "it allows for a spatial and high temporal resolution with a dead time between two pulses of and a total time accuracy below .",

    "the contrast is determined to be and , respectively .",
    "we took similar images for other biprism potentials and in a separate series of measurement for the gold covered biprism fiber . in each image the interference contrast @xmath17 and the fringe distance @xmath18 was determined .",
    "the interference contrast depends on the lateral and longitudinal coherence of the source .",
    "the first one is determined by the source width , the second by the wave number distribution and therefore by the energy spread of the particle emission @xcite . due to the small energy spread of the sat ( see tab . [",
    "tab : comparison ] ) , the latter contribution can be neglected .",
    "therefore , the theoretical interference contrast depends only on the source width and can be obtained by the expression @xcite :    @xmath19    whereby the factor @xmath20 considers a reduction of the theoretical contrast by effects such as e.g. deflected incoherent background electrons , mechanical vibrations , temperature drifts or impurities on the biprism wire .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 is the width of the source which is in @xcite assumed to be gaussian distributed , @xmath22 is the distance between the source and the biprism and @xmath23 the one between the biprism and the entrance of the quadrupole lens .",
    "we determined the quadrupol magnification @xmath24 in a computer beam path simulation with the program simion . in fig .",
    "[ fig : contrast ] the measured values for the contrast @xmath17 are compared with the fringe distance @xmath18 after magnification for different biprism potentials . by a fit of eq .",
    "[ equ : contrast ] a reduction factor of @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) and a source size of was determined for the gold covered biprism fiber . in a further series of measurement with the gold - palladium covered fiber we extracted a value of .",
    "therefore the emission spot determined by the application of this theory is significantly larger than the size of an iridium atom ( ) .",
    "the reason for this deviation might be related to an oscillation of the biprism fiber .",
    "the effect of such a motion is qualitatively equivalent to a motion of the source .",
    "it leads to a temporary varying phase shift of the single particle waves and to the same decrease in contrast as for a broader emission center .",
    "an evidence for the vibration amplitude was given by an experiment in a different field of research , but with a comparable fiber . by the evanescent coupling between a bottle microresonator and the subwavelength - diameter waist of a tapered optical fiber ,",
    "the root mean square fluctuation of the fiber was estimated to be in the frequency range up to @xcite .",
    "such a biprism vibration would lead to an interference contrast related to a source size of @xmath27 , even for sat emission .",
    "the thermal amplitude of the string vibration of the fiber in @xcite was calculated to be .",
    "this could be a limit of source size resolution by the contrast in a biprism interferometer .",
    "however , the low frequency contribution of this vibrational dephasing can in principle be removed by a correlation analysis of the spatial and temporal signal in the detector @xcite .",

    "it was extracted and calculated according to a scheme described in @xcite . the determined deviation to @xmath33 of less than verifies a poisson - distribution of the sat emission between",

    "we demonstrated the first biprism electron interferometer with a single atom tip field emitter in a modified setup based on @xcite and analyzed the interference pattern for different superposition angles .",
    "the new source was also characterized in a separate field electron and field ion microscope .",
    "it was demonstrated that the emission spot size is only a single iridium atom resulting in a beam of high spatial coherence that is emitted into an angle of only for electrons and for helium ions due to a self focusing effect related to the tip geometry .",
    "the field emission of the ir / w(111 ) sat was also characterized in the time domain by the second order correlation function .",
    "it verified that the emission is perfectly poisson - distributed with a deviation of less than for time distances from 0 to between the detected electrons .",
    "we provided a comparison of important beam emission features with other electron and ion sources indicating the superior properties of single atom tips as a novel source for biprism electron and ion interferometers .",
    "+ furthermore , we presented a method for biprism wire fabrication to minimize the fiber - diameter uncertainty .",
    "the biprism is drawn from a standard optical fiber in a highly controlled and reproducible heat - and - pull process .",
    "the resulting silica nanowire was then coated with a thin gold and gold - palladium layer , yielding a diameter of about and a length of .",

    "<S> experiments with electron or ion matter waves require a coherent , monochromatic and long - term stable source with high brightness . </S>",
    "<S> these requirements are best fulfilled by single atom tip ( sat ) field emitters . </S>",
    "<S> the performance of an iridium covered w(111 ) sat is demonstrated and analyzed for electrons in a biprism interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore we characterize the emission of the sat in a separate field electron and field ion microscope and compare it with other emitter types . </S>",
    "<S> a new method is presented to fabricate the electrostatic charged biprism wire that separates and combines the matter wave . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to other biprism interferometers the source and the biprism size are well defined within a few nanometers . </S>",
    "<S> the setup has direct applications in ion interferometry and aharonov - bohm physics . </S>"
