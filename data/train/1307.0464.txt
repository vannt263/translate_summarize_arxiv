    "over the past several decades the correlated disorder has been the focus of a large number of studies in different fields of science .",
    "the unflagging interest in systems with correlated fluctuations is explained by specific properties they demonstrate and their prospective applications .",
    "moreover , at present there is a commonly accepted viewpoint that our world is complex and correlated .",
    "the most peculiar manifestations of this concept are the records of brain activity and heart beats , human and animal communication , written texts , dna and protein sequences , data flows in computer networks , stock indexes , etc .",
    "the studies of random systems in physical and engineering sciences can be divided into two parts .",
    "the first one investigates , analyzes and predicts the behavior of such systems , whereas the second one , which is considerably smaller , develops the methods of construction , or generation , of random processes with desired statistical properties .",
    "the essence of the second approach is to construct a mathematical object ( for example , a correlated sequence of symbols or numbers ) with tailored statistical characteristics .",
    "this approach provides not only a deeper insight into the nature of correlations but also a creative tool for designing the devices and appliances with random components in their structure such as different wave - filters , diffraction gratings , artificial materials , antennas , converters , delay lines , etc .",
    "these devices can exhibit unusual properties or anomalous dynamical , kinetic or transport characteristics controlled by a proper choice of disorder .",
    "there are many algorithms for generating long - range correlated sequences : the mandelbrot fast fractional gaussian noise generation  @xcite , the voss procedure of consequent random addition  @xcite , the correlated lvy walks  @xcite , the expansion - modification li method  @xcite , the method of markov chains  @xcite , etc .",
    "we believe that the convolution method ( and its variant  the fourier filtering method  @xcite ) is one of the most efficient . this method may be used to generate enhanced diffusion , isotropic and anisotropic self - affine surfaces , isotropic and anisotropic correlated percolation  @xcite .",
    "the convolution method allows one to construct sequences with random elements belonging to a continuous space of states  the space of real numbers @xmath0  the widest possible space .",
    "note that if some restrictions on possible states of random variables are imposed , say , we need to generate a random dichotomous sequence , then the problem becomes much more complicated  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we generalize the convolution method of generating a discrete statistically homogeneous colored sequence with a given correlation function .",
    "the method is based on a linear transformation of white noise with the use of the filtering function  the kernel of the convolution operator  and gives a rather simple relation between this function and the pair correlation function @xcite . here",
    "we present the matrix generalization of this method to construct a bunch of @xmath1 cross  correlated sequences and study their statistical properties .",
    "the scope of the paper is as follows .",
    "first , we discuss briefly the rice convolution method for generating random sequences . in section  [ genconv ]",
    "we generalize the method to a set ( or , a bunch ) of @xmath1 cross - correlated statistically homogeneous sequences with a prescribed binary correlation matrix .",
    "some analytical solutions for the problem of the correlation matrix decomposition are presented in section [ explsol ] .",
    "section [ charfunc ] is devoted to studying statistical properties of sequences constructed with this particular method .",
    "section  [ ex - gen ] contains an example for constructing two cross - correlated chains with a given correlation matrix .",
    "this section provides a brief introduction to the most known and frequently used method for generating random correlated sequences with a continuous space of states  @xcite .",
    "let us introduce a homogenous random white noise sequence @xmath2 of independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "variables @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "all statistical properties of the sequence are determined by the one - point probability distribution function ( pdf ) and its moments .",
    "the most important among them are the mean value @xmath5 , which we put hereafter equal to zero without loss of generality , and the two - point correlation function , which is expressed via the unit variance @xmath6 : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the kronecker delta symbol .",
    "the brackets @xmath9 mean a statistical ( arithmetic , cesro s ) average along the chain , @xmath10 or the equivalent average with the pdf @xmath11 @xmath12 it is supposed that the mean values and the variance of sequence @xmath2 exist .",
    "the linear convolution transformation with _ filtering _ function @xmath13 generates a new _ correlated _ sequence @xmath14 , @xmath15 this formula ( probably , the most important throughout the paper , no matter how simple it may seem ) determines both analytical properties of correlated sequence and the method of its numerical construction ( beginning with the white - noise sequence @xmath2 ) .",
    "so , we have to be able to answer a number of questions : what restrictions should be imposed on the filtering function , what one - point probability distribution and two - point , or pair , correlation functions of @xmath14 sequence are .",
    "it is evident from the first formula of equation  ( [ 118 ] ) that @xmath16 it is also simple to calculate the pair auto - correlation function@xmath17 this equation is readily derived by substituting of equation  ( [ x f alpha ] ) into the definition of correlation function @xmath18 , @xmath19 since our main purpose is to consider the cross - correlated sequences , it is worth to note that sequences @xmath2 and @xmath14 are correlated , @xmath20 this property explains the meaning of the filtering function .    considering the sets of functions @xmath13 and @xmath21 as two vectors and their combination @xmath22 as a scalar product of two equal vectors , one of which rotates around another ( from the passive point of view the components @xmath21 are obtained by cyclic rotations of the coordinate system and @xmath13 are the components of the vector prior to rotation ) we conclude that @xmath23 we will also use the _ correlation coefficient _ @xmath24 , @xmath25 by definition , the correlation coefficient @xmath24 is normalized to unity , @xmath26 .",
    "the last property can be seen as a transformation @xmath27 , which renormalizes the old variables @xmath28 to the new ones with unit variances . because the initial uncorrelated chain @xmath2 is statistically homogeneous and the generating function @xmath29 in equation  ( [ x f alpha ] ) depends on the difference @xmath30",
    "only , the generated random sequence @xmath14 is statistically homogeneous as well .",
    "this property implies the independence of one - point distribution functions on the number of site , the possibility of averaging  ( [ mean distr ] ) along the sequence , the dependence of binary correlation functions on the difference of their arguments and many other useful properties of the sequence .",
    "thus , equation  ( [ c sum f ] ) relates the pair correlation function to the filtering function provided that the series @xmath22 converges .",
    "a simpler relation between them , the fourier transformation of equation  ( [ c sum f ] ) , reads @xmath31 here we use the following formulae for the fourier transform and its inverse : @xmath32 two properties of the function @xmath33 , stemming from discreteness and real - valuedness of the function @xmath34 , will be useful in what follows : @xmath35 from the second expression of equation([df - ds ] ) and equation  ( [ k_f_1chain ] ) , we immediately obtain the wiener - khinchin theorem  @xcite for power spectrum @xmath36 , @xmath37 it is easy to see that equations  ( [ c sum f ] ) and ( [ k_f_1chain ] ) correctly reflect the parity of function @xmath38 and its fourier transform @xmath39 for any function @xmath40 : @xmath41 the solution of equation  ( [ k_f_1chain ] ) is @xmath42\\,\\sqrt{\\tilde{c}_x(k)},\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is an arbitrary odd function , @xmath44 .",
    "thus , the solution of the problem of constructing a random sequence with a given correlation function @xmath45 , or its fourier transform @xmath39 , is reduced to finding the filtering function @xmath46 , which determines ( see equation  ( [ x f alpha ] ) ) the transformation of uncorrelated sequence @xmath47 into correlated @xmath48-sequence .    for numerical generation of random sequences , in equation  ( [ x f alpha ] )",
    "an even kernel function @xmath49 is commonly used .",
    "nevertheless , we see that equation  ( [ f k c ] ) allows one to find solutions in more general form .",
    "let us consider this in more detail and represent the filtering function @xmath40 as the sum of its even @xmath50 and odd @xmath51 parts , @xmath52 .",
    "then equations  ( [ c sum f ] ) and ( [ k_f_1chain ] ) become @xmath53 , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\quad \\tilde{c}_x(k ) = \\tilde{f_c}^2(k ) + \\tilde{f_s}^2(k ) .",
    "\\label{k_f_1cs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the fourier cosine and sine transforms of @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "another method , the inverse fourier transformation , for generating a sequence of random numbers with long - range correlations is given in @xcite .",
    "this method can be viewed as a modification of the above discussed convolution method and it is based on the fourier transform of equation  ( [ x f alpha ] ) @xmath56 the first step in generating correlated random numbers is to calculate the fourier transform of uncorrelated sequence @xmath57 . a method which enables one to avoid these cumbersome calculations and generate directly the values of @xmath58",
    "is presented in appendix .",
    "now consider the effect of the filtering function shape on correlation properties of a random sequence qualitatively .",
    "suppose that the filtering function is bell - shaped with a characteristic scale of the order of unity .",
    "the characteristic scale of the function @xmath59 is then @xmath60 . for @xmath61",
    "the overlap of functions @xmath13 and @xmath21 in equation  ( [ c sum f ] ) is maximal , so that @xmath62 is maximal as well .",
    "if the `` distance '' @xmath63 between @xmath13 and @xmath21 exceeds @xmath64 , the overlap almost vanishes , so that @xmath65 takes on small values .",
    "it means that , by an order of magnitude , the characteristic scale of the function @xmath59 is , at the same time , the correlation length @xmath64 of the generated random sequence .",
    "furthermore , it is clear that if @xmath64 goes to zero , the sequence @xmath14 becomes uncorrelated white noise with @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the other limit , @xmath64 goes to infinity , describes totally correlated sequence , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "all the above - mentioned facts are demonstrated by the following simple example  @xcite : @xmath70 @xmath71    note , if ( in some cases ) at @xmath72 the filtering function vanishes , then the correlation function also vanishes at @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "the convolution method outlined in the previous section can be generalized to the generation of a set of @xmath1 cross - correlated statistically homogeneous random sequences @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , with a given binary correlation matrix @xmath78 , whose entries @xmath79 , @xmath80 , are @xmath81 the diagonal elements of the correlation matrix are the auto - correlation functions , which describe the relationships between the elements of the same sequence , while the non - diagonal entries represent cross - correlations between the elements of different sequences . as",
    "above , here we also suppose @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "the correlation matrix elements are real and , as seen directly from equation  ( [ def_ncorr ] ) , have the following property : @xmath84 in terms of the fourier transform determined by equation  ( [ fourtr1 ] ) , this property reads @xmath85 where the asterisk denotes complex conjugation .",
    "equations   ( [ corr_element ] ) and ( [ ft_corr_element ] ) can be written in matrix form : @xmath86 where the symbols @xmath87 and @xmath88 indicate the transpose and conjugate transpose of a matrix , respectively . since the matrix @xmath89 has complex entries and is equal to its conjugate transpose , it is hermitian ; hence , its diagonal elements are real .    to construct the correlated sequences @xmath75 ,",
    "let us consider as a starting point @xmath1 independent uncorrelated white - noise random sequences @xmath90 : @xmath91    similarly to the 1-sequence convolution method , we construct @xmath1 correlated sequences @xmath75 as a sum of convolutions of delta - correlated sequences @xmath92 with filtering functions @xmath93 in the following way : @xmath94    substituting equation ( [ def_x_i ] ) into definition of correlator ( [ def_ncorr ] ) and using property ( [ def_alpha_i ] ) , we reveal the relationship between the elements of the correlation matrix and the filtering functions : @xmath95    the fourier transform translates equation([ncorr_r ] ) into the system of equations in @xmath96-space : @xmath97    the matrix form of equation  ( [ ncorr_k ] ) , which generalizes equation ( [ k_f_1chain ] ) to the case of @xmath1 cross - correlated sequences , embodies the algebraic content of the problem under consideration : @xmath98 or , equivalently , @xmath99    thus , to construct the bunch of @xmath1 cross - correlated sequences @xmath75 with the given correlators we have to find the factorization of the hermitian matrix @xmath89 into a product of the fourier transform of generating function @xmath100 and its hermitian transpose @xmath101 .",
    "this is the well - known problem of liner algebra ( see , for example , @xcite ) and there are different approaches to its solution .",
    "let us consider some of them in relation to the problem under consideration .",
    "* spectral decomposition*. since the correlation matrix @xmath89 is hermitian , it can be diagonalized by a unitary matrix @xmath102 and the resulting diagonal matrix has real entries only ( @xcite , theorem 4.1.5 ) .",
    "if the matrix @xmath103 is positive - definite , we can easily find the formal solution of equation([eq_matrixhermconjug ] ) : @xmath104 here @xmath105 are the eigenvalues of matrix @xmath89 .",
    "this implies @xmath106    * cholesky decomposition*. for hermitian positive - definite matrices , there are other decompositions , which solve equation ( [ eq_matrixhermconjug ] ) .",
    "one of them is the cholesky decomposition factorizing the matrix into a lower triangular matrix @xmath107 with strictly positive diagonal entries and its conjugate transpose @xcite , @xmath108 which immediately provides the solution to our problem , @xmath109 .    * ldl factorization*. besides",
    ", one can use the so - called ldl decomposition factorizing a hermitian matrix into a lower triangular matrix @xmath107 , a diagonal matrix @xmath110 with positive entries and conjugate transpose of the lower triangular matrix @xcite ) , @xmath111 in the context of our problem , @xmath112 .",
    "* hermitian ansatz . *",
    "it is also natural to look for a solution of problem ( [ eq_matrixhermconjug ] ) assuming @xmath100 to be a hermitian matrix , @xmath113 . in this case equation ( [ eq_matrixhermconjug ] ) can be converted to @xmath114 formally the solution of this equation can be presented as @xmath115 with unitary matrix @xmath102 and @xmath116 determined in equations  ( [ matrixu ] ) and ( [ spectral ] ) .",
    "note that all of the above discussed solutions are particular ones .",
    "the general solution can be obtained from any of them by right multiplication by an arbitrary unitary matrix @xmath117 ; if @xmath118 is a solution of our problem , then such is @xmath119 .",
    "thus , for example , implementing the hermitian ansatz and representing the unitary matrix @xmath117 as an exponential function of an arbitrary skew - hermitian matrix @xmath120 , @xmath121 we can write the general solution of equation ( [ eq_matrixhermconjug ] ) as @xmath122 this solution is a matrix generalization of equation([f k c ] ) for the problem of @xmath1 cross - correlated sequences .",
    "considered algorithms of decompositions ( [ spectral ] )  ( [ formalsolution ] ) are widely used in programming @xcite and continue to be developed and optimized for specific forms of matrices . nevertheless , explicit analytical solutions of this problem can be found just in a few situations . in the next section",
    "we are going to discuss some of them .",
    "equation ( [ eq_matrixhermconjug ] ) admits explicit solutions in the case of cyclic bunch of @xmath1 statistically identical sequences @xmath75 with the nearest neighbor cross - correlations , when the correlation matrix entries @xmath123 are @xmath124    we consider the simplest case of @xmath125 , @xmath126 and , hence , the correlation matrix is @xmath127 under this assumption , one can verify by direct substitution that @xmath128 is one of the solutions of equation ( [ eq_matrixhermconjug ] ) . here",
    "@xmath129 multiplying matrix @xmath118 by an arbitrary unitary matrix , we get the general solution .",

    "it is well known that most part of the transport properties of complex random systems are determined by the fourier transform of the correlation function .",

    "that the integrated correlation function is suitable in numerical studies of random processes as a clear indicator of the correlation length of the sequence ; the position of maximal value of @xmath166 corresponds to @xmath64 .    now consider the distribution function @xmath173 of the random variable @xmath28 determined by equations  ( [ weak cor ] ) .",

    "then , the question arises : which of statistical characteristics reflect the asymmetry of filtering function ?",

    "this function is determined up to the gauge factor containing an arbitrary odd function .",
    "there is no restriction on the parity of the filtering function .    in section 3",
    "we present the matrix generalization of the method for a bunch of @xmath1 sequences . to construct @xmath1 cross - correlated sequences we start with @xmath1 independent uncorrelated white - noise random sequences @xmath256 . similarly to the 1-sequence convolution method we built @xmath1 cross - correlated sequences @xmath75 as a sum of convolutions of delta - correlated sequences @xmath257 with filtering functions @xmath93 .",
    "the set of these functions is obtained via the factorization of the hermitian matrix @xmath89 into a product of the fourier transforms of the generating function @xmath100 and its hermitian transpose @xmath101 .",
    "different decompositions of the correlation matrix are considered : spectral , cholesky , ldl and hermitian ansatz .",
    "explicit expressions for some particular cases are presented .",
    "it was noticed that different decompositions of the correlation matrix provide the filtering matrix elements with essentially different analytical properties .",
    "statistical properties of the sequences constructed by the convolution method were examined .",
    "one - point probability distribution functions in the cases of weak and strong correlations were studied .",
    "the correlation function , integrated correlation function and the second integral of the correlation function ( the variance of the sum of @xmath258 random variables ) were found for asymmetric weak short - range correlations in the 1-sequence case .",
    "it was shown that the even part of the filtering function is responsible for generation of isotropic sequences",
    ". it will be interesting to study this phenomenon in the long - range correlation limit .",
    "if the filtering function is smooth and a large number of summands contribute to equation  ( [ c sum f ] ) , the distribution function @xmath173 has the gaussian or lvy form .",
    "an example of numerical construction of two correlated chains with a given correlation matrix was presented .",
    "two different decompositions of the correlation matrix were used .",
    "it was shown that both of them give identical numerically reconstructed correlation functions ( in spite of the difference of their analytical properties ) .",
