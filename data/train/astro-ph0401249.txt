    "redshift surveys are an extremely useful tool to study the large scale distribution of galaxies . of the many possible statistical estimators",
    "the power spectrum of the density fluctuations has emerged as one of the easiest to connect to theories of structure formation in the universe , especially in the limit of gaussian fluctuations where the power spectrum is the complete statistical description .",
    "there are several ways to measure the power spectrum ( for a comparison of techniques see * ? ? ?",
    "over the last few years , the karhunen - love method ( * ? ? ? * , hereafter vs96 ) has been recognized as the optimal way to build an orthogonal basis set for likelihood analysis , even if the underlying survey has a very irregular footprint on the sky .",
    "a variant of the same technique is used for the analysis of cmb fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the shape of the power spectrum is well described by a small set of parameters @xcite . for redshift surveys , it is of particular importance to consider the large - scale anisotropies caused by infall @xcite . using a forward technique that compares models directly to the data , like the kl - transform , enables us to easily consider these anisotropies in full detail . here",
    "we present results of a parametric analysis of the shape of the fluctuation spectrum for the sdss galaxy catalog .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) plans to map nearly one quarter of the sky using a dedicated 2.5 meter telescope at apache point observatory in new mexico .",
    "a drift - scanning ccd camera @xcite is used to image the sky with custom set of 5 filters ( @xmath12 ) @xcite to a limiting @xcite magnitude of @xmath13 .",
    "observations are calibrated using a 0.5 meter photometric telescope @xcite . after a stripe of sky has been imaged , reduced , and astrometrically calibrated @xcite ,",
    "additional automated software selects potential targets for spectroscopy .",
    "these targets are assigned to @xmath14 diameter ( possibly overlapping ) circles on the sky called tiles @xcite .",
    "aluminum plates drilled from the tile patterns hold optical fibers that feed into the sdss spectrographs @xcite . the sdss main galaxy sample ( mgs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will consist of spectra of nearly one million low redshift ( @xmath15 ) galaxies creating a three dimensional map of local large scale structure .",
    "considerable effort has been invested in preparing sdss mgs redshift data for large scale structure studies .",
    "the first task is to correct for fiber collisions .",
    "the minimum separation between optical fibers is @xmath16 which causes a correlated loss of redshifts in areas covered by a single plate .",
    "galaxy targets that were not observed due to collisions are assigned the redshift of their nearest neighbor .",
    "next the sky is divided into unique regions of overlapping spectroscopic plates called sectors . the angular completeness is calculated for each sector as if the collided galaxies had been successfully measured .",
    "galaxy magnitudes are extinction - corrected with the @xcite dust maps , then k - corrections are applied and rest frame colors and luminosities are calculated @xcite .",
    "subsamples are created by making appropriate cuts in luminosity , color , and/or flux . a luminosity function",
    "is then calculated for each subsample @xcite and used to create a radial selection function assuming @xmath17 and @xmath18 cosmology .",
    "this analysis considers two samples of sdss data , which we will label sample 10 and sample 12 .",
    "both samples were prepared in similar manners , although using different versions of software .",
    "sample 12 represents a later state of the survey and the sample 10 area is contained in sample 12 .",
    "sample 10 represents 1983.39 completeness - weighted square degrees of spectroscopically observed sdss data and 165,812 mgs redshifts .",
    "sample 12 has 205,484 redshifts over 2406.74 square degrees .",
    "both samples are larger than the 1360 square degrees of spectroscopy in data release 1 ( dr1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of the sdss .",
    "the geometry of the samples and dr1 are qualitatively similar , consisting of two thick slices in the northern cap of the survey and three thin stripes in the south .",
    "the samples used have a luminosity cut of @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "rest frame quantities ( ie absolute magnitudes ) are given for the sdss filters at z=0.1 , the median depth of the mgs . in a study of the two point correlation function of sdss galaxy redshifts",
    ", @xcite found that the bias relative to @xmath22 galaxies varies from 0.8 for galaxies with @xmath23 to 1.2 for galaxies with @xmath24 .",
    "@xcite found similar results for the 2df , with the trend becoming more pronounced at luminosities significantly greater than @xmath25 .",
    "the dependence of clustering strength on luminosity could induce an extra tilt in the power spectrum because more luminous galaxies contribute more at large scales and less luminous galaxies contribute more at small scales due to the number of available baselines .",
    "we minimize this effect by staying within @xmath26 .",
    "a uniform flux limit of @xmath27 was applied , leaving 110,345 redshifts for sample 10 and 134,141 for sample 12 .",
    "although there are luminosity limits for this sample , it is essentially a flux limited sample with a ( slowly ) varying selection function .",
    "we used galaxies in the redshift range @xmath28 .",
    "following the strategy described in vs96 , the first step in a karhunen - love ( kl ) eigenmode analysis of a redshift survey is to divide the survey volume into cells and use the vector of galaxy counts within the cells as our data .",
    "this allows a large compression in the size of the dataset without a loss of information on large scales .",
    "our data vector of fluctuations @xmath29 is defined as    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the observed number of galaxies in the @xmath32 cell and @xmath33 is its expected value , calculated from the angular completeness and radial selection function .",
    "the data is `` whitened '' by the factor @xmath34 to control shot noise properties in the transform ( vs96 ) .",
    "we call this the `` overdensity '' convention .",
    "the kl modes are the solutions to the eigenvalue problem @xmath35 with the correlation matrix of the data given by    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the cell - averaged correlation matrix , @xmath38 is the shot noise term , and @xmath39 can be used to account for correlated noise ( not used in this analysis ) .",
    "the most obvious source of correlated noise in the mgs would be differences in photometric zero points between different sdss imaging runs , which would result in `` zebra stripe '' patterns of density fluctuations .",
    "the mgs selection has a magnitude limit , but no color selection terms , so the variation in target density depends only linearly on the photometric calibration .",
    "the @xmath40 band zero point variation is 0.02 mag rms @xcite , indicating that the density variation should be @xmath41 .",
    "the transformed data vector @xmath42 is the expansion of @xmath43 over the kl modes @xmath44 :    @xmath45    the kl basis is defined by two properties : orthonormality of the basis vectors , @xmath46 , and statistically orthogonality of the transformed data , @xmath47 .      in order to directly compare cosmological models to our redshift data using a two point statistic",
    "we must calculate the redshift space correlation function @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 describe positions in the observable angles and redshift .",
    "the infall onto large scale structures affects the velocities of galaxies leading to an anisotropy in redshift space for a power spectrum that is isotropic in real space @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived an expansion of the correlation function that accounts for this anisotropy in linear theory for arbitrary angles .",
    "the expansion is    @xmath51    where the @xmath52 coefficients are polynomials of @xmath3 and functions of the relative geometry of the two points .",
    "the quantity @xmath3 relates infall velocity to matter density and is well approximated by the fitting formula @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the bias parameter .",
    "further terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rscfexp ] ) are negligible as long as @xmath55 ( where @xmath40 is the distance to the cell and @xmath56 is the radial selection function ) does not significantly differ ( ie orders of magnitude ) from unity . for the redshift range considered in this analysis @xmath57 .",
    "when using counts - in - cells , we must calculate the cell - averaged correlation matrix    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the cell window function and @xmath60 is the position of the @xmath32 cell . to be precise , @xmath59 should describe the shape of the cell in redshift space .",
    "numerical calculation of this multi - dimensional integral can be computationally expensive . however , for the case of spherically symmetric cells we can change the order of integration and perform the redshift space integrals in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cellavgcm ] ) analytically before the @xmath61-space integral in eq .  ( [ eq : rscfpart ] ) . if both cells have the same window function , we can use eq .",
    "( [ eq : rscfexp ] ) as our cell - averaged correlation function ( with @xmath49 and @xmath50 indicating the cell positions ) if we replace @xmath62 with @xmath63 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rscfpart ] ) where @xmath64 is the fourier transform of the cell window function .",
    "this results in a one dimensional numerical integral .",
    "the full technical details of our method will be presented in ( * ? ? ? * in preparation ) .",
    "we used hard spheres as our cell shape and placed them in a hexagonal closest packed ( the most efficient 3d packing , with a 74% space - filling factor ) arrangement . the current slice - like survey geometry and packing arrangement causes some spheres to partially protrude outside the survey .",
    "the effective fraction of the sphere that is sampled is also affected by the angular completeness of our survey ( which averages @xmath65 ) .",
    "we calculate our expected counts as if the sphere was entirely filled and multiply the observed galaxy counts by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the fraction of the @xmath68th sphere s volume that was effectively sampled .",
    "this sparser sampling also increases the shot noise by a factor of @xmath66 .",
    "cells with @xmath69 were rejected as too incomplete .",
    "we found that a @xmath70 sphere radius allowed us to fill the survey volume with a computationally feasible number of cells without the spheres protruding too much out of the survey , while smoothing on sufficiently small length scales so that we do not lose information in the linear regime ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "we used 14,194 cells for sample 10 and 16,924 for sample 12 .",
    "the calculation of the sampling fraction for each cell is difficult due to the complicated shapes of the sectors (  [ sub : lss ] ) .",
    "we created a high resolution angular completeness map in a sql server database using @xmath72 random angular points over the entire sky .",
    "each point was assigned a completeness weighting by finding which sector contained the point or setting the completeness to zero for points outside the survey area .",
    "we used a hierarchical triangular mesh ( htm ; * ? ? ? * ) spatial indexing scheme to find all points in the completeness map that pierce a cell and calculate the volume weighted completeness for that cell .",
    "the kl transform is linear , so there is no loss of information if we use all of the eigenmodes .",
    "however , if we perform a truncated expansion we can use the kl transform for compression and filtering .",
    "the difference between the original data vector and a truncated reconstruction , @xmath73 , where we use only @xmath74 out of a possible @xmath75 modes can be related to the eigenvalues of the excluded modes by @xmath76 the error is minimized ( in a squared sense ) when we retain modes with larger eigenvalues and drop modes with smaller eigenvalues , which is sometimes called optimal subspace filtering @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalue of a kl mode is also related to the range in @xmath61-space sampled by that mode .",
    "our models assume that linear theory is a good approximation , which is only valid on larger scales .",
    "consequently we only wish to use kl modes that fall inside a `` fermi sphere '' whose radius is set by our cutoff wavenumber @xmath77 . if we sort modes by decreasing eigenvalue , they will densely pack @xmath61-space starting from the origin .",
    "the modes resist overlapping in @xmath61-space due to orthogonality .",
    "the shape of a kl mode in @xmath61-space resembles the fourier transform of the survey window function .",
    "this means that the number of kl modes within the `` fermi sphere '' depends mostly on the survey window function and does not drastically change if we change the size of our cells , as long as we have significantly more cells than modes ( which means that our cells must be smaller than the cutoff wavelength ) . in a fully three dimensional survey",
    "the modes would fill @xmath61-space roughly spherically and @xmath78 .",
    "however , the current sdss geometry resembles several two dimensional slices , resulting in kl modes that resemble cigars in @xmath61-space .",
    "these modes pack layer - by - layer into spherical shells whose diameters are integer multiples of the long axis of the mode .",
    "5 in @xcite for a visualization .",
    "this results in a scaling more like @xmath79 .    in choosing the number of kl modes to use in our analysis we try to keep as many modes as possible for better constraints on our parameter values while requiring that our modes are consistent with linear theory .",
    "we have developed a convenient method for determing the range in @xmath61-space probed by each kl mode .",
    "we separate the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rscfpart ] ) into bandpowers in @xmath61 .",
    "this allows us to determine how strongly each mode couples to each bandpower , which shows a coarse picture of the spherically averaged position of the mode in @xmath61-space .",
    "[ fig : modes ] shows a grayscale image of how the modes couple to the bandpowers .",
    "once we choose a value for the cutoff wavenumber @xmath77 , we truncate our expansion at the mode where wavenumbers larger than @xmath77 start to dominate",
    ".    we can use the statistical properties of the transformed data to check that we are avoiding non - linearities .",
    "a rescaled version of the kl coefficients @xmath80 should be normally distributed .",
    "non - linear effects would cause skewness ( third moment ) and/or kurtosis ( fourth moment ) in the distribution of @xmath81 .",
    "we do not see evidence of non - linear effects when we use @xmath82 ( corresponding to length scales @xmath83 ) .",
    "this value for the cutoff wavenumber leaves us with 1500 modes for sample 10 and 1850 modes for sample 12 .",
    "we estimate cosmological parameters by performing maximum likelihood analysis in kl space .",
    "the likelihood of the observed data given a model @xmath84 is    @xmath85 \\label{eq : lh}\\ ] ]    where @xmath86 is the covariance matrix and can be calculated as the projected model correlation matrix ,    @xmath87    our method is based upon a linear comparison of models to data , thus the @xmath88 ( and @xmath89 ) model matrices only contain second moments of the density field .",
    "this linear estimator is computationally more expensive than quadratic or higher order estimators , but the results are less sensitive to non - linearities . for a comparison of different estimation methods , see @xcite .    in practice",
    "we must decide on an explicit parametrization .",
    "we construct a power spectrum assuming a primordial spectrum of fluctuations with a spectral index @xmath90 .",
    "we use a fitting formula from  @xcite to characterize the transfer function , including the baryon oscillations .",
    "we fit for @xmath0 and @xmath91 while taking a prior of @xmath92 from the hubble key project @xcite and fixing @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "we fit the linearly extrapolated @xmath2 for normalization , where @xmath94 and @xmath54 is the bias .",
    "linear theory redshift - space distortions are characterized by @xmath3 ( see  [ sub : rscf ] ) .    in order to search an appreciable portion of parameter space we have developped efficient methods to calculate the model covariance matrices @xmath86 .",
    "the straightforward approach would be to calculate the model correlation matrix for a set of parameters and then project into the kl basis and calculate a likelihood , but this is computationally expensive .",
    "the covariance matrix can easily be written as a linear combination of matrices and powers of @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( see  [ sub : rscf ] ) , so we can project pieces of the correlation matrix and add them in the appropriate proportions for those parameters . however , the shape of the power spectrum depends on @xmath95 , @xmath11 , and @xmath96 in a non - trivial way .",
    "we project each bandpower of the correlation matrix ( see  [ sub : modeselection ] ) separately and add the pieces of the covariance matrix together with appropriate weighting to represent different power spectrum shapes .",
    "this alleviates the need for further projections",
    ". we must be careful when choosing our bandpowers so that we retain sufficient resolution to accurately mimic power spectrum shapes ( especially baryon oscillations ) , but we must also be careful that our @xmath61 ranges are large enough that the integrals converge correctly .",
    "note that a non - optimal choice of fiducial parameters does not bias our results , but it can result in non - minimal error bars .",
    "this procedure can be iterated if necessary .",
    "our best - fit maximum - likelihood parameter values for samples 10 and 12 are presented in table [ tab : results ] .",
    "results are given for the priors described in ",
    "[ sub : modeltest ] and also when using the additional prior @xmath97 from wmap @xcite .",
    "we show the results of sample 10 and 12 to give some indication of sample variance , although sample 10 is a subset of sample 12 .    the middle column of fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] shows the marginalized one - dimensional and two - dimensional confidence regions for the power spectrum shape parameters @xmath0 and @xmath11 for sample 10 without the additional prior on @xmath9 .",
    "there is a strong correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath11 .",
    "the gross shape of the power spectrum ( ie ignoring the baryon oscillations and concentrating on the position of the peak and slope of the tail ) is nearly constant along the ridge of this correlation due to a degeneracy between shifting the position of the peak with @xmath0 and adding power to the peak with @xmath11 .",
    "however , the strength of the baryon oscillations varies significantly over this range .",
    "table [ tab : results ] shows that our estimates of @xmath0 agree well with the wmap value of @xmath98 @xcite and the 2df value of @xmath99 @xcite when we use the additional prior on @xmath9 , and the associated confidence regions are shown in the left column of fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] .",
    "the results with the @xmath9 prior indicate that the gross shape of the power spectrum we measure is consistent with wmap and 2df , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : pk ] which shows the ( isotropic ) real - space power spectra inferred from the cosmological parameter estimates from the three surveys .",
    "however , the results without the @xmath9 prior show that we have difficulty breaking the degeneracy between @xmath0 and @xmath11 because the baryon oscillations are not resolved due to the current state of the sdss window function",
    ".    the right column of fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] shows the marginalized one - dimensional and two - dimensional confidence regions for @xmath2 ( normalization ) and @xmath3 ( distortions ) for sample 10 .",
    "again there is a strong correlation between these parameters , which is expected from their dependence on @xmath54 .",
    "our constraint on @xmath2 is strong , but we can only measure @xmath3 to @xmath100 which limits our ability to perform an independent estimate of @xmath54 .",
    "we can compare our results to wmap by examining the combination of parameters @xmath101 , for which we obtain the value @xmath102 , in excellent agreement with the wmap result of @xmath103 @xcite . by combining our measurements with wmap results",
    "we find @xmath104 for our galaxy sample , but this compares information dominated by galaxies with redshifts @xmath105 to present - day matter .",
    "if we use a @xmath106 model to extrapolate to the present , we would find @xmath107 .",
    "our galaxies cover a range of luminosities but our signal is dominated by the more luminous galaxies ( brighter than @xmath25 ) because there are more long baselines available for the more distant galaxies .",
    "this must be kept in mind when comparing our measurement of @xmath2 with other estimates using sdss data which focus on @xmath25 galaxies @xcite    this analysis used less than one third of the data that will comprise the completed sdss survey .",
    "our ability to measure cosmological parameters will increase as the survey area increases , but we should also gain leverage in resolving features in the power spectrum as our survey window function becomes cleaner .",
    "the thickest slice of data from the samples used was roughly @xmath108 , implying a thickness of @xmath109 at @xmath110 .",
    "as the slices become thicker , the kl modes will become much more compact in that direction in @xmath61-space .",
    "thus we will benefit from the change in the survey aspect ratio in addition to the increase in survey area .",
