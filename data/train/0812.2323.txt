    "the recent discovery of the iron pnictide superconductor lafeaso@xmath0f@xmath1  ( lfao - f ) over a fluorine concentration of @xmath17 with the maximal critical temperature ( @xmath18 ) of 26  k @xcite and the following revelation of much increased @xmath18 upon the substitution of la for other rare - earth elements ( ce , pr , nd , sm , ... leading to a maxium @xmath18 of 55  k @xcite ) or the application of pressure for lfao - f ( @xmath1943  k",
    "@xcite ) have triggered broad interest in the mechanism yielding a relatively high @xmath18 in this new class of compounds .",
    "they have a layered structure like high-@xmath18 cuprates , where the dopant and conducting layers are so separated that carriers ( _ electrons _ , in this case ) introduced by the substitution of o@xmath20 with f@xmath21 in the la@xmath11o@xmath11 layers move within the layers consisting of strongly bonded fe and as atoms .",
    "moreover , very recent developments demonstrate increasing variety in the methods of electron doping such as oxygen depletion @xcite or co substitution for fe @xcite .",
    "a similar situation is presumed for the ternary compound @xmath22fe@xmath11as@xmath11 ( @xmath23 ba , sr , ca ) , where _ holes _ are introduced by the substitution of @xmath24 with @xmath25 ions ( @xmath26 na , k , cs ) @xcite .",
    "they exhibit another qualitative similarity to cuprates in that superconductivity occurs upon carrier doping of pristine compounds that exhibit magnetism @xcite .",
    "recent results of the muon spin rotation / relaxation ( @xmath2sr ) experiment on a variety of iron pnictide superconductors showed that the superfluid density @xmath27 may fall on the empirical line on the @xmath27 vs @xmath18 diagram observed for the _ underdoped _ cuprates @xcite , from which possibility of the common mechanism of superconductivity is argued between oxypnictides and cuprates .",
    "the iron pnictides exhibit an interesting similarity with cuprates that the variation of @xmath28 against doping is `` bell - shaped '' in hole - doped compounds @xcite while @xmath18 does not vary much with @xmath10 in electron - doped case @xcite .",
    "however , recent investigations in electron - doped ( @xmath29 type ) cuprates strongly suggest that such an electron - hole ",
    "asymmetry \" is a manifestation of difference in the fundamental properties of underlying electronic states between these two cases , where the @xmath29 type cuprates are much more like normal fermi liquids rather than doped mott insulators @xcite .",
    "this might be readily illustrated by pointing out that , given all the doped carriers participate in the cooper pairs ( as suggested by experiment ) , the insensitivity of @xmath18 against the variation of @xmath27 ( @xmath30 ) observed in lfao - f @xcite can not be reconciled with the above - mentioned empirical linear relation , while it is reasonably understood from the conventional bcs theory where condensation energy is predicted to be independent of carrier concentration .",
    "more interestingly , the very recent revelation of superconductivity upon co substitution for fe in lafeaso and other iron pnictides ( where the co atoms serves as electron donors ) brings out a sheer contrast between these two classes of materials in terms of response to the substitution of transition metal ions as well as the tolerance of superconductivity to the distortion of conducting layers @xcite .",
    "the close relationship of magnetism and superconductivity suggests that a detailed investigation of how these two phases coexist ( and compete ) near the phase boundary will provide important clues to elucidating the paring mechanism . among various techniques",
    ", @xmath2sr has a great advantage in that it can be applied in systems consisting of spatially inhomogeneous multiple phases , providing information on respective phases according to their fractional yield .",
    "our @xmath2sr measurement in a lfao - f sample with @xmath3 ( @xmath31 k ) reveals that these two phases indeed coexist in the form of macroscopic phase separation , and more interestingly , that a spin glass - like magnetic phase develops in conjunction with superconductivity in the paramagnetic phase @xcite .",
    "this accordance strongly suggests a common origin of the electronic correlation between these two competing phases .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath2sr  study on cafe@xmath0co@xmath1asf  ( cfcaf , a variation of lfao - f with trivalent cation and oxygen respectively replaced with divalent alkali metal and fluorine , and the carrier doping is attained by substituting co for fe ) reveals a unique character of the fe@xmath11as@xmath11 layers that the superconducting state is realized over a vicinity of co atoms , as inferred from the observation that the superconducting volume fraction is nearly proportional to the co concentration @xcite .",
    "the rest of the cfcaf specimen remains magnetic ( strongly modulated spin density wave ) , thus indicating that superconductivity coexists with magnetism again in a form of phase separation .",
    "as already mentioned , @xmath2sr  can provide information selectively from the superconducting parts of samples even in the situation that they coexist with magnetism .",
    "we examine the temperature dependence of @xmath32 in lfao - f , cfcaf , and in ba@xmath0k@xmath1fe@xmath11as@xmath11  ( bkfa ) @xcite , and discuss the degree of anisotropy in their superconducting order parameters and the strength of coupling to bosons that mediate the cooper pairs .",
    "although the oxypnictides @xmath33feaso@xmath0f@xmath1 with rare - earth substitution ( @xmath34 nd , sm , etc . ) exhibits higher @xmath18 than that of lfao - f , strong random magnetic fields from rare - earth ions preclude a detailed study of the ground state using sensitive magnetic probes like @xmath2sr . in this regard , the original lfao - f ( as well as other two compounds in this review ) has a major advantage that we can attribute the origin of magnetism , if at all detected by @xmath2sr , to that of the fe@xmath11as@xmath11 layers without ambiguity .",

    "meanwhile , the spectrum at 2  k is split into two components , one that exhibits a fast depolarization and the other that remains to show gaussian - like relaxation .",

    "<S> the presence of macroscopic phase separation into superconducting and magnetic phases in lafeaso@xmath0f@xmath1  and cafe@xmath0co@xmath1asf  is demonstrated by muon spin rotation ( @xmath2sr ) measurement across their phase boundaries ( @xmath3 for lafeaso@xmath0f@xmath1   and @xmath40.15 for cafe@xmath0co@xmath1asf ) . in lafeaso@xmath5f@xmath6 , </S>",
    "<S> both magnetism and superconductivity develop simultaneously below a common critical temperature , @xmath7 k , where the magnetism is characterized by strong randomness . </S>",
    "<S> a similar , but more distinct segregation of these two phases is observed in cafe@xmath0co@xmath1asf , where the magnetic phase retains @xmath8 as close to that of the parent compound ( @xmath9120 k ) and the superconducting volume fraction is mostly proportional to the co content @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the close relationship between magnetism and superconductivity is discussed based on these experimental observations . concerning superconducting phase , </S>",
    "<S> an assessment is made on the anisotropy of order parameter in the superconducting state of lafeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 , cafe@xmath0co@xmath1asf , and ba@xmath0k@xmath1fe@xmath11as@xmath11  ( @xmath12 ) based on the temperature dependence of superfluid density [ @xmath13 measured by @xmath2sr . </S>",
    "<S> the gap parameter , @xmath14 , determined from @xmath15 exhibits a tendency that hole - doped pnictides ( ba@xmath0k@xmath1fe@xmath11as@xmath11 ) is much greater than those in electron - doped ones ( lafeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 , cafe@xmath0co@xmath1asf ) , suggesting difference in the coupling to bosons mediating the cooper pairs between relevant @xmath16 electron bands . </S>"
