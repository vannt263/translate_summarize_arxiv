    "<S> however , inspite of these obvious triumphs , there is universal agreement that there are aspects of the theory which are counter - intuitive and perhaps even paradoxical . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , understanding fundamental problems involving dark matter and dark energy @xcite in cosmology may need a consistent quantum theory of gravity . </S>",
    "<S> unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity towards a unified theory of quantum gravity @xcite is the holy grail of modern theoretical physics . </S>",
    "<S> such unification attempts involve modifications of either or both theories . </S>",
    "<S> however , all such attempts would rely very strongly on precise knowledge and understanding of the current versions of both theories . </S>",
    "<S> this makes precision tests of fundamental aspects of both quantum mechanics and general relativity very important to provide guiding beacons for theoretical development .    </S>",
    "<S> the double slit experiment ( figure 1 ) is one of the most beautiful experiments in physics . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to its pivotal role in optics , it is frequently used in classic textbooks on quantum mechanics @xcite to illustrate basic principles . </S>",

    "<S> how do we quantify this effect in quantum mechanics ?    . </S>",
    "<S> ]    an intuitive and simple way of understanding this problem is to appeal to feynman s path integral formalism @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> investigations of this quantity may also be relevant to theoretical attempts to derive the born rule @xcite . if born s postulate for a square law for probabilities is true and if @xmath10 , then the quantity @xmath11 defined by @xmath12 is identically zero in quantum mechanics . here </S>",

    "<S> this choice of normalization can sometimes lead to false peaks in the @xmath9 as a function of detector position due to the denominator becoming very small at certain positions . </S>",
    "<S> we use a somewhat different normalization , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the intensity at the central maximum of the triple slit interference pattern to avoid this problem </S>",

    "<S> , sorkin had also assumed that the contribution from non - classical paths was negligible . </S>",
    "<S> now , what is the effect of non - classical paths on @xmath9 ? if one can derive a non - zero contribution to @xmath9 by taking into account all possible paths in the feynman path integral formalism , that would mean @xmath21 is not strictly true and experimentalists should not be led to conclude that a measurement of non - zero @xmath9 would immediately indicate a falsification of the born rule for probabilities in quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> a measured non - zero @xmath9 could also be explained by taking into account the non - classical paths in the path integral . </S>",
    "<S> there is thus a theoretical estimate for a non - zero @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> of course , the immediate expectation would be a clear domination of the classical contribution and perhaps a very negligible contribution from the non - classical paths which would in turn imply that @xmath21 is true in all  experimentally observable conditions . </S>",
    "<S> \" however , what we go on to discover is that this expectation is not always true . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to have experimental parameter regimes in which @xmath9 is measurably large . </S>",
    "<S> this in turn leads to a paradigm shift in such precision experiments . </S>",
    "<S> observation of a non - zero @xmath9 which is expected from the proposed correction to @xmath21 would in fact also serve as an experimental validation of the full scope of the feynman path integral formalism .    </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned before , in calculating @xmath9 , one inherently assumes contributions only from the classical straight line paths as shown in green in figure 2 . in this paper , we have estimated the contribution to @xmath9 from non - classical paths , thus providing the first theoretical estimate for @xmath9 .    for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> , we will use the free particle propagator in our calculations . for a particle in free space and away from the slits , this is a reasonable approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we account for the slits by simply removing from the integral all paths that pass through the opaque metal . </S>",
    "<S> an estimate for the error due to this assumption has been worked out in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the normalized energy space propagator @xmath22 @xcite for a free particle with wave number @xmath23 from a position @xmath24 to @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 although in this paper , we will be mainly focusing on analyzing optics based experiments using photons , this propagator equation can be used both for the electron and the photon as argued in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we should point out that there are corrections to the propagator due to closed loops in momentum space from quantum field theory considerations . </S>",
    "<S> we have explicitly estimated that the effects of such corrections will be negligibly small @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> consider the triple slit configuration shown in figure 2 . according to the path integral prescription , </S>",
    "<S> all paths that go from the source to the detector should contribute in the analysis . in the quantity of interest , @xmath9 </S>",
    "<S> , some important simplifications occur . </S>",
    "<S> only those non - classical paths that involve propagation between at least two slits would contribute to the leading non - zero value . </S>",
    "<S> this is because any non - classical path that goes through _ only _ the @xmath27th slit can be taken into account in the wave - function @xmath28 at the detector and hence would cancel out in @xmath9 as can be easily checked . in light of the above , the entire set of paths from the source to the detector through the slits </S>",
    "<S> can be divided into two classes :    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> paths which cross the slit plane exactly once pertaining to a probability amplitude @xmath29 ; a representative path is shown by the green line and 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> paths which cross the slit plane more than once at two or more slits pertaining to a probability amplitude @xmath30 @xcite as for instance , represented by the purple line .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath31    we wish to estimate @xmath30 relative to @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> an example of a representative @xmath29 in our problem is the probability amplitude to go from the source @xmath32 to the detector @xmath33 through slit @xmath34 which we call @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> this uses the general scheme that a path in feyman s path integral formalism can be broken into many sub - paths and the propagator is the product of the individual propagators @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the interslit distance , @xmath5 is the slit width , @xmath6 is the slit height , @xmath38 and @xmath39 as shown in figure 2 . for the source and the detector far apart from one another , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. , _ in the fraunhofer regime , @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 in the region of integration , therefore , @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly @xmath44 giving @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> thus we have @xmath46}\\,.\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> these are fresnel integrals and have been evaluated using mathematica .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now proceed to the probability amplitude for multiple slit crossings _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. , _ @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> an example of a representative @xmath30 in our problem is the probability amplitude to go from the source @xmath32 to the detector @xmath33 following the kind of path shown in figure 2 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the particle goes from the source to the first slit and then loops around the second and third slits before proceeding to the detector . </S>",
    "<S> we represent this by @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> this is approximated by @xcite : @xmath49 here the @xmath50 integral runs over slit @xmath34 and @xmath51 integral runs over slits @xmath52 and @xmath53 and where @xmath54 making approximations appropriate to the fraunhofer regime , using stationary phase approximation @xcite for the oscillatory integrals the integral becomes :    @xmath55}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    an important simplification occurs at this stage : the @xmath56 integral in @xmath57 is same as in the integral for @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> since we are just concerned with ratios , the contributions from the @xmath56 integrals cancel out .    in terms of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , </S>",
    "<S> the propagator to go from the source to the detector when all three slits are open is given by : @xmath59 where @xmath60 include non - classical terms arising when all slits are open . </S>",
    "<S> similarly : @xmath61 @xmath62 are non - classical terms involving only @xmath34 and @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly for @xmath63 and @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in terms of propagators , @xmath65     as a function of detector position . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> a ) this is for incident photons , slit width = 30@xmath67 m , interslit distance = 100@xmath67 m , distance between source and slits and slits and detector = 18 cm and incident wavelength = 810 nm @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> b ) this is for incident electrons , slit width = 62 nm , interslit distance = 272 nm , distance between source and slits = 30.5 cm and slits and detector = 24 cm and debroglie wavelength = 50pm @xcite . ]    </S>",
    "<S> and the normalization @xmath15 is given by @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the value of @xmath70 at the central maximum . by numerical integration </S>",
    "<S> , we find @xmath9 at the central maximum of the triple slit interference pattern to be of the order of @xmath71 for the parameters used in the triple slit experiment reported in reference @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> what would have been expected to be zero considering only straight line paths now turns out to be measurably non - zero having taken the non - classical ones into account @xcite . in figure 3 , we show @xmath9 as a function of detector position . </S>",
    "<S> we also show a plot of the triple slit interference pattern as a function of detector position which gives a clearer understanding of the modulation in the plot for @xmath9 .    </S>",
    "<S> the experiment reported in reference @xcite was not sensitive to a theoretically expected non - zeroness in @xmath9 due to systematic errors . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the absence of such systematic errors , it is definitely possible to use a similar set - up to measure a non - zero @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> simulation results indicate that the set - up could have measured a much lower value of @xmath9 but the presence of the systematic error due to one misaligned opening in the blocking mask set the limitation of the experiment making it possible to only measure a value of @xmath9 upto @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> there is no reason why this systematic error can not be removed in a future version of the experiment thus making it a perfect table - top experiment to test for the presence of non - classical paths in interference experiments . </S>",
    "<S> however , experiments of the kind reported in @xcite are not as ideally suited for this purpose . </S>",
    "<S> this is because , in our analysis , we have worked in the thin - slit approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the effective `` slit - thickness '' in a diffraction grating based interferometer set - up would be quite big and hence the resulting @xmath9 would certainly be smaller .    </S>",
    "<S> what we go on to also find in our current analysis is that @xmath9 is very strongly dependent on certain experimental parameters and one can definitely find a parameter regime where @xmath9 would be even bigger , hence easier to observe . </S>",
    "<S> we find that keeping all other experimental parameters fixed , @xmath9 increases with an increase in wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for instance , for an incident beam of wavelength 4 cm ( microwave regime ) and slit width of 120 cm and interslit distance of 400 cm , a theoretical estimate for @xmath9 would be @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> this is an experiment which can be performed for instance in a radio astronomy lab .    </S>",
    "<S> experiments of this kind where the value of @xmath9 due to non - classical paths can be estimated would definitely be of great interest as they would serve as a simple experimental demonstration of how the basic assumption that a composite wavefunction is just the sum of component wavefunctions is not always true . in a sense </S>",
    "<S> they would also serve as a direct table - top demonstration of the complete scope of the feynman path integral formalism where not only the straight line paths are important but also the looped paths can make a sizeable contribution depending on one s choice of experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the effects due to such non - classical paths may also be used to model possible decoherence mechanisms in interferometer based quantum computing applications . </S>"
