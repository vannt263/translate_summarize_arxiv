    "however , these low otprs might not be a consequence of an actual non - lte ortho - to - para _ abundances _ ratio but a result of optical depth effects in the fluorescence - pumping of the ortho-2 ( sternberg & neufeld @xcite ) . using these considerations ,",

    "the rotational diagrams for the two sources show a zig - zag distribution since the column densities in the ortho-2 levels j=3 and 5 are lower than those expected from the para-2 levels for the lte otpr . for the typical temperatures involved in these transitions ( @xmath2  200 k ) , the lte otpr is @xmath2  3 .",
    "similar rotational diagrams derived from the 2 pure - rotational lines have been previously found in hh54 by neufeld et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and in ngc7023 by fuente et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . for these sources where",
    "extinction is known to be low , the immediate conclusion was that the otpr was not in lte .    the 2 emission has been detected in all sources of our sample indicating that the 2 emission in the gc must be relatively widespread and extended ( martn - pintado et al .",
    "this is also suggested from the measured linewidths of the 2 lines ( see section 2 ) .",
    "anyhow , even in the extreme case that the 2 emission were point - like , the corrections for the different apertures would be small and would not affect substantially the conclusions about the otpr .",
    "for a point - like source the s(0 ) line will be more diluted than the s(1 ) and s(2 ) lines because of the larger beam ( @xmath35 instead of @xmath36 ) .",
    "the situation for the s(3 ) line will be the opposite since the aperture at this wavelength is @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , in this limit case , the column densities in the level j=2 ( derived from the s(0 ) line ) averaged in a beam of @xmath38 would be larger by a factor of 1.4 , while on the opposite , the beam - averaged column density in the j=5 level would be smaller by a factor of 1.4 .",
    "hence , the correction for different apertures , can not explain the zig - zag distribution in the rotational diagram .",
    "a more critical correction is that for the extinction produced by the foreground material .",
    "as described by martin - pintado et al .",
    "( @xcite ) the weakness of the s(3 ) line in the gc clouds should be due to the extinction produced by the silicate feature at 9.7 @xmath27 m in the foreground dust clouds . in clouds with a lte 2 otpr",
    ", one can use the intensity of the s(3 ) line to estimate the visual extinction once the relative value for the opacity at 9.7 @xmath27 m to the 0.55 @xmath27 m opacity is known .",
    "one could , in principle , apply corrections for increasing extinctions until the column density in the j=5 level is consistent with the column densities derived for other levels , i.e. , until the rotational plot is a straight line ( in the case of a boltzmann distribution with one source temperature ) or a smooth curve ( in the case of a temperature gradient ) . in clouds with a non - equilibrium otpr",
    "one could use an equivalent method using only ortho-2 levels , but obviously more than two levels are needed .",
    "the effect of foreground extinction on the rotational diagram is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figext ] , where the observed fluxes have been corrected for 30 ( filled triangles ) and 60 mag ( filled circles ) of visual extinction , using the extinction law of draine & lee ( @xcite ) .",
    "visual extinctions larger than 60 mag are needed for consistency between the s(1 ) and s(3 ) line intensities and a lte otpr . in this case , the curvature of the rotational plots suggests the presence of a large temperature gradient in the 2 emitting region . to constrain the visual extinction toward these sources , in the following sections we will estimate the total column densities of dust and gas from measurements of the continuum dust emission , 13co , and 18o with a similar resolution to that of the sws aperture .",
    "we applied the large velocity gradient ( lvg ) approximation to our data , to derive the physical conditions and the column densities of molecular gas from the emission of the j=2 - 1 line of 18o and the j=1 - 0 lines of 18o and 13co .",
    "the lines toward the two sources show complex profiles with two velocity components . from the line intensity ratios",
    "one can see that these components have slightly different physical conditions .",
    "the 18o j=2 - 1 to j=1 - 0 line ratio is 1.0 - 1.4 in and can not be determined for the other source .",
    "the j=1 - 0 13co to 18o ratio ranges between 5 and 14 in and is @xmath39  7 in m+1.56@xmath170.30 . to within a factor of 2 , these values are in agreement with the typical isotopic abundances found in the gc for carbon and oxygen ( see wilson & matteucci 1994 ) indicating that the 13co lines are optically thin . from the 18o j=2 - 1 to j=1 - 0 ratio we derive for the 2 densities given in table 3 for two cases : high kinetic temperature ( @xmath40=100  k ) and low kinetic temperature ( @xmath40=20  k ) . for those 2 densities",
    "we have constrained the total column densities using the 13co line intensities . when the 18o lines were not detected the range of possible 13co(1 - 0 ) column densities",
    "was obtained by changing the 2 density between 10@xmath41 and 10@xmath42 for @xmath40=100  k and between 10@xmath43 and 10@xmath44 for @xmath40= 20 k ( see httemeister et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in the case of cold gas and",
    "even higher 2 densities , the 13co column densities will increase only in a factor of 1.3 since for low temperatures and densities @xmath45 10@xmath42 the j=10 transition of 13co is thermalized .",
    "the 2 column densities , 2 , in table 3 have been derived from the 13co column density and a fractional abundance with respect to 2 of 5  10@xmath46 .",
    "they are typically of a few 10@xmath47 @xmath5 , in good agreement with the values given by httemeister et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . with these column densities , we have derived the total visual extinction , @xmath48 , using the standard conversion factor : 2()=@xmath49 .",
    "thus the extinctions toward the two gc sources studied in this paper are typically of 15 - 20 magnitudes .      from the lws data we can make a direct estimate of the dust temperature and the dust column densities toward both sources .",
    "though the aperture of the lws is larger than that of the sws , the dust emission in the gc is relatively smooth ( odenwald & fazio @xcite ) and one does not expect large variations within the lws aperture .",
    "the spectra for the two sources have very similar shapes with the maximum of the emission at @xmath2 100  @xmath27 m , indicating that the bulk of the dust is relatively cold with temperatures below 30 k , in agreement with previous estimates ( odenwald & fazio @xcite ; gautier et al .",

    "we have assumed extended emission ( @xmath60 ) and then we have fitted the continuum spectrum with @xmath56 , @xmath48 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 as free parameters . as an example , we show in fig .

    "@xmath51=27  k and @xmath56=0.1 .    table 4 lists the results of the parameters for the best fits for the two sources .",
    "the visual extinctions derived for the two sources are 30 and 40 mag .",
    "these values are in agreement , to within a factor of 2 , with those derived from the co data .",
    "the dust emission is dominated by the cool ( @xmath61 15 k ) component ( @xmath62 ) , while the slightly warmer component ( @xmath61 30 k ) contributes only 10@xmath24 - 20@xmath24 to the total optical depth ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "we can also fit the spectra with larger spectral indexes by increasing the dust column densities .",
    "for instance , an spectral index of 1.5 will increase the visual extinction to 50 - 100 mag .",
    "these high values of @xmath48 are very unlikely since they are almost one order of magnitude higher than the estimates made from co ( see table 3 ) .",
    "since the extinction derived from co and the continuum accounts for the total gas and dust along the line of sight , they must represent an _",
    "upper _ limit to the extinction to the 2 emitting region .",
    "considering the uncertainties introduced by the unknown spectral index and the many free parameters in the dust column density determination , in the following discussion we will assume that upper limits to the visual extinction of the 2 emitting region are those derived from the co emission , namely , 16 magnitudes for and 20 mag for m+1.56@xmath170.30 .",
    "these values are within a factor of two of estimates obtained from the total dust column density .      as discussed at the beginning of sect . 3",

    "as we see , @xmath65 is @xmath2  250  k for both sources while @xmath64 is slightly higher ( @xmath2  270  k ) indicating the presence of a moderate temperature gradient .",

    "the preshock density seems somewhat high but it is plausible since the s(3 ) line is _ apparently _ thermalized , which implies a lower limit to the 2 density of @xmath82 . in any event , the widespread distribution of the hcn emission ( jackson et al .",
    "@xcite ) shows that densities of @xmath83  are common in the gc .",
    "the main processes that affect the otpr of h@xmath3 are proton exchange collisions with h@xmath84 and reactive collisions with h atoms .",
    "ortho - para conversion in grain surfaces is thought to be less efficient . the rate coefficient for the proton exchange reaction @xmath85 is @xmath86 @xmath87 s@xmath9 ( gerlich @xcite ) .",
    "the analogous reactions with h@xmath88 and h@xmath6o@xmath84 may also occur at a similar rate ( see e.g. le bourlot et al .",
    "this rate gives an ortho - para conversion timescale , @xmath89 , of @xmath90 yr , where @xmath91 represent the density of h@xmath84 , h@xmath88 or h@xmath6o@xmath84 in .",
    "one should note that the actual conversion time can be a factor of 10 larger than @xmath89 ( see flower and watt 1984 ) .",
    "the rate coefficient for the reactive collisions with h atoms @xmath92 is @xmath93 @xmath87 s@xmath9 ( see e.g. le bourlot et al .",
    "@xcite ) . due to the high activation barrier of this reaction ( 3900 k ) , in cold and dense molecular clouds the dominant process will be proton exchange collisions .",
    "this is also true for low velocity shocks of @xmath2 10 since the maximum temperature achieved in the post - shock region is only @xmath94 k. if the h@xmath84 and h@xmath88 densities ( @xmath95(h@xmath84 ) , @xmath95(h@xmath88 ) ) in the postshock region of a 10 shock were as high as @xmath96 ( see timmermann @xcite ) , @xmath89 would be @xmath97 yr .",
    "it is worth - noting that recent models for ortho - para conversion in shocks by wilgenbus et al .",
    "( @xcite ) find much lower h@xmath84 and h@xmath88 densities in the postshock region . in this case , the timescale for ortho - para conversion would be @xmath98 yr .",
    "on the other hand , the time needed for the passage of the proposed 10 velocity shock , from the point where the neutral gas starts to heat up to the point where the gas has reached interstellar temperatures again , is @xmath99  yr ( see timmermann @xcite ) .",
    "however the timescales in which the neutral gas is at high temperatures are much shorter .",
    "hence , if the initial otpr was lower than 3 , the heating - cooling of the gas is too fast for the otpr to reach the equilibrium at the temperatures of the shocked material .",
    "shocks with velocities @xmath100 20 heat the gas to temperatures @xmath100 700 k. then , collisions with h would be the main ortho - to - para conversion mechanism , and indeed , the ortho - para conversion timescale would be low enough to obtain at least some conversion in the shock timescale as in the source hh54 ( neufeld et al .",
    "however , the lines ratios in and can not be explained with a preshock otpr of @xmath101 1 and a shock with velocity @xmath3910 km s@xmath9 .",
    "therefore , the observed otpr in these clouds must be approximately the preshock otpr .",
    "this conclusion is independent of any shock model since the low temperatures involved by a 10 shock are not sufficient for the h@xmath3-h reactive collisions to be effective and , even for the largest predicted h@xmath84 and h@xmath88 abundances , the proton exchange reactions are not fast enough to give ortho - para conversion in the shock timescale .",
    "if the otpr of the preshock gas was in equilibrium at the gas temperature , the temperature should be @xmath2 80 k. in this case , the preshock gas should have been already heated before the shock front compresses and heats the gas to 250  k. however , there is no strong reason to believe that the preshock otpr should be in equilibrium at the preshock temperature . the 2 molecule is formed mainly on the grain surfaces by a highly exothermic reaction .",
    "thus , if it is rapidly ejected to gas phase the otpr will be the typical otpr at high temperature , i.e. , 3 .",
    "on the other hand , if it is not evaporated immediately from the grain there will be ortho - to - para conversion by collisions with radicals , impurities or defects and the otpr could reach the equilibrium value at @xmath2 30 k ( dust temperature ) of @xmath740.01 . in our case",
    ", the preshock otpr of @xmath102 suggests that the 2 molecules were ejected from the grains with otpr @xmath391 .",
    "afterwards , this ratio could decrease due to proton exchange processes .",
    "the equilibrium proton abundance in dense ( @xmath95(h@xmath3 ) @xmath83 ) clouds , where photoprocesses are not important , depends mainly on the ionization by cosmic rays and on charge exchange reactions with neutral molecules .",
    "modeling the chemistry of dense pdrs , sternberg and dalgarno ( @xcite ) found @xmath95(h@xmath84 ) of @xmath103 in the well uv - shielded region for a cosmic ray ionization rate ( @xmath104 ) of 5 @xmath105 , implying @xmath106 yr .",
    "a similar timescale is obtained for proton exchange collisions with h@xmath88 .",
    "the density of h@xmath6o@xmath84 could reach @xmath107 cm@xmath75 and thus @xmath89 could decrease by a factor of 10 .",
    "nevertheless , the actual time to reach the lte otpr would be longer .",
    "flower & watt ( 1984 ) have studied the temporal evolution of the otpr in molecular clouds . using the same rate coefficient as above for the proton exchange process",
    ", they have shown that for h@xmath84 densities using a simplified chemical network .",
    "] of @xmath109 the actual time needed for an otpr=3 to be in equilibrium at 30 k ( similar to the observed cold component in the gc clouds ) is @xmath110 yr .",
    "in particular , if @xmath111 ( or @xmath112 ) is @xmath113 , then @xmath2 5 10@xmath11 yr will be needed to have an otpr=1 . assuming that the 2 was ejected to gas phase after formation with an otpr 3 , the shock front reached the cloud approximately 10@xmath11 yr after the formation of the 2 molecules , since this is the time needed for an otpr@xmath23 to descend to @xmath21 in a dense molecular cloud",
    "we have presented iso sws observations of the s(0 ) , s(1 ) , s(2 ) , and s(3 ) pure - rotational lines of 2 and lws observations of the dust continuum and iram-30 m 13co and 18o observations toward the gc molecular clouds and . using the co data and dust column densities from the lws spectra we estimate @xmath2 20 mag of visual extinction toward these sources .",
    "the two estimates of the extinction agree within a factor of 2 for the standard gas - to - dust conversion factor . according to the two components scenario proposed by httemeister et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , the low - j co emission arises from the cold gas component and is coupled to the dust at a temperature of @xmath101 30 k. the warm component ( @xmath61 250 k ) column density observed directly in 2 is , at least , @xmath2 15 @xmath24 of the cold one and would have very little warm dust associated with it . from the lws spectra we set a conservative upper limit to the warm gas column density associated with the warm dust of 2  10@xmath75 times that of the warm 2 column density .    after correcting for the dust extinction",
    ", we derive an otpr of 1.0 @xmath31 0.4 , which is far from the lte value expected for the gas temperatures of 250 k. we have also compared the warm 2 column densities to the 3 observations by httemeister et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , and derived 3 abundances of @xmath2 2  10@xmath73 , similar to those in the cold component ( httemeister et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the low dust temperatures , the high 3 abundances , the large co linewidths , the non - lte 2 otpr , in addition to the high gas temperatures suggest that the warm gas component is heated by low velocity shocks with speeds of @xmath2 10 .",
    "to explain the otpr we propose the following scenario .",
    "2 is formed in the grain surfaces and ejected to gas phase with otpr3 .",
    "after @xmath114 years , the time required to reach the preshock otpr=1 , a low velocity shock heated the gas to the observed temperatures of 250 k , but the otpr was almost unaltered because the timescale for the passage of such a shock is much shorter than the ortho - to - para conversion timescale .",
    "taking into account the shock timescale this occurred less than 10@xmath13 yr ago .",
    "it is interesting to note that the timescale of the cloud s galactic rotation period is also @xmath114 years .",
    "this fact suggests that the origin of the shocks can be related to large scale dynamics of the gc region .",
