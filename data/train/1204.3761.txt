    "it has long been argued that the mean - squared error in sensing an optical phase shift can exhibit , at best , an inverse quadratic scaling with the mean number of photons in the quantum state used to sense the phase @xcite .",
    "recently , following some claims that this so - called `` heisenberg limit '' ( or h limit ) on phase estimation may be beaten @xcite , several authors have revived the subject by providing rigorous proofs of lower bounds , not limited to optical interferometry , with h limit scaling @xcite .",
    "interestingly , these proofs use diverse techniques , namely , the speed limit on quantum evolutions @xcite , the entropic uncertainty relations @xcite , and the quantum ziv - zakai bound @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we develop another technique for obtaining lower bounds  classical rate - distortion theory  that was introduced into quantum metrology in @xcite , and apply it to both lossless and lossy optical phase estimation .",
    "rate - distortion theory @xcite is a branch of classical information theory @xcite that was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and elaborated in ref .",
    "@xcite by shannon , and forms the theoretical basis for the lossy compression of data sources . in the simplest scenario involving a continuous data source , the source generates an output modeled as a random variable @xmath2 , and we wish to map @xmath2 to another random variable @xmath3  one that perhaps presents lesser storage requirements  in such a way that a predefined distortion measure @xmath4 such as the average mean - squared error between @xmath2 and @xmath3 is kept below a tolerable level @xmath5 . roughly speaking , rate - distortion theory tells us how much information must remain in @xmath3 in order to do so , and shows that coded schemes can achieve this compression limit .",
    "a fascinating historical introduction into the theory and practice of lossy data compression may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the development of quantum information theory @xcite in the past few decades has been much influenced by the ideas of classical information theory , including rate - distortion theory .",
    "one of the first results of quantum information theory , the noiseless coding theorem of schumacher @xcite is a quantum version of shannon s noiseless source coding theorem , which itself corresponds to the rate - distortion theory with allowed distortion set to zero .",
    "more recently @xcite , there have been efforts to formulate a quantum rate - distortion theory applicable to the lossy compression of quantum rather than classical information sources .    in this paper",
    ", we apply classical rate - distortion theory to the problem of estimation of an optical phase using quantum probe states whose mean energy .",
    "i.e. , photon number , is constrained .",
    "we adopt a bayesian approach in which an arbitrary prior distribution of the phase is assumed and the squared error is averaged over this distribution .",
    "we first consider the ideal lossless case in which we obtain a rigorous lower bound for the mean - squared error that exhibits h limit scaling .",
    "this derivation applies to any multimode probe state as long as the energy in the modes sensing the phase is constrained to be at most @xmath1 .",
    "we then allow for the presence of loss , and show that , for any probe state with a single mode undergoing the phase shift , the mean - squared phase error scales inversely as the mean number of photons in the probe state , i.e. , it exhibits the `` standard quantum limit '' ( sql ) scaling of coherent states @xcite .",
    "consider the random variable @xmath6 representing the phase shift to be sensed , and let its prior probability density be @xmath7 . in rate - distortion theory , @xmath6 is viewed as a data source with differential entropy @xmath8 given by @xmath9 and measured in nats / symbol .",
    "for another random variable @xmath10 representing an estimate of @xmath6 , we can define the mean - squared error ( or mse ) as @xmath11 ^ 2 = \\int_0^{2\\pi } p_\\phi(\\phi ) p_{\\hat{\\phi}|\\phi}(\\hat{\\phi}|\\phi)\\left ( \\hat{\\phi}- \\phi\\right)^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the conditional density of @xmath10 given @xmath6 .",
    "the mean - squared error is an example of a _ distortion measure _ , denoted @xmath13 in general , which is an ensemble average of a numerical function of the source output and the estimate that measures how far they are different for the purposes of a particular application .",
    "a variety of distortion measures may be used @xcite , but only the mean - squared error distortion measure is considered in this paper . the _ rate - distortion function _",
    "@xmath14 is defined as @xcite @xmath15 where the quantity being minimized is the mutual information @xmath16 between the source and estimate and the infimum is over all conditional distributions @xmath12 that yield average distortion less than or equal to @xmath17 .",
    "note that @xmath14 depends on the prior distribution @xmath7 and the distortion measure @xmath18 .",
    "the rate - distortion function @xmath14 may be thought of informally as the amount of non - redundant information per symbol emitted by the source , given that we allow for a distortion of up to @xmath17 in a reconstructed version of the source .",
    "examples of the computation of @xmath14 for some standard sources and distortion measures may be found in @xcite , although numerical evaluation is usually required for an arbitrary source . in general , the function @xmath14 and its inverse @xmath19 are decreasing and convex in their respective arguments . for the mean - squared error distortion measure , the following lower bound on @xmath14 may be used @xcite:- @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the _ entropy power _ of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "note that the bound is useful for @xmath22 $ ] ( outside which it can be replaced with zero ) and is convex and decreasing on this interval .",
    "the following lower bound on @xmath19 follows from eq .  :",
    "- @xmath23    the operational significance of the rate - distortion function is elucidated by the positive and converse parts of the noisy source coding theorems of shannon @xcite . for our purpose of obtaining lower bounds on the achievable distortion ,",
    "the converse part is of primary relevance .",
    "the fundamental result , called the _ information transmission inequality _ in @xcite , is stated below ( refer fig .  1 ) .    c    [ ] given @xmath24 independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) source outputs @xmath25 , each with prior distribution @xmath7 . for",
    "a given distortion measure @xmath13 , let the rate - distortion function of the source be @xmath14 nats / symbol .",
    "given an encoder @xmath26 that maps @xmath25 to an @xmath27-symbol - long codeword @xmath28 that is transmitted over a channel @xmath29 with capacity @xmath30 nats / use . let the channel output codeword be @xmath31 which is mapped by a decoder @xmath32 to an estimate @xmath33 of @xmath34 . defining a per - symbol average distortion measure @xmath35 , we have @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the function inverse to @xmath14 .",
    "note that , unlike the positive part of the noisy source coding theorem which applies in the asymptotic limit of long codes with @xmath38 , theorem 1 applies to any given system of the form of fig .  1 .",
    "the application of theorem 1 to obtain performance lower bounds in classical estimation and communication is well - known @xcite .",
    "its application to quantum metrology was first proposed in @xcite and is made as follows .",
    "the key point is to implement the classical channel @xmath29 appearing in fig .  1 using a quantum system in the following way . given a codeword symbol @xmath39",
    ", we implement a _ modulation _",
    "map @xmath40 that takes the symbol @xmath39 and a given _ probe state _ @xmath41 in the hilbert space @xmath42 of the quantum system of interest into another density operator @xmath43 .",
    "we then make a _ measurement _ on @xmath44 described by a positive - operator - valued measure ( povm ) @xmath45 @xcite , whose outcome @xmath46 is the output codeword symbol ( see inset to fig .  1 ) .",
    "any such choice of probe state , modulation map , and povm measurement induces a probability transition matrix @xmath47 , i.e. , a classical channel , for which a channel capacity @xmath30 may be defined .",
    "this @xmath30 may then be used in eq .   to yield a lower bound on the distortion .",
    "the calculation of @xmath30 can be made to incorporate any constraints relevant to the sensing problem , e.g. , an energy constraint on the probe state , a constraint on the kind of modulation allowed , or a constraint on the measurement povm .    in the context of quantum optics",
    ", we can consider a fixed class of probe states , e.g. , coherent or quadrature squeezed states , certain kinds of modulation such as phase modulation or displacement in phase space , and standard measurements such as photon counting , homodyne or heterodyne detection .",
    "the channel capacities under a mean energy constraint under these probe , modulation , and measurement choices are known in many cases @xcite . using this approach , performance bounds for the communication or sensing of a gaussian source",
    "were obtained in @xcite .",
    "in addition , for lossless estimation of a uniform phase parameter , a lower bound exhibiting standard quantum limit ( sql ) scaling , i.e. , the behavior @xmath48 , was obtained for coherent state probes , and a lower bound exhibiting h limit scaling was obtained for a quadrature - squeezed - state ( or two - photon coherent state ( tcs ) ) probe .    in this paper , we are concerned with lower bounds on the mse for lossless and lossy phase estimation under a mean energy constraint @xmath1 on the probe state @xmath41 used to sense the phase .",
    "we will not consider coding over multiple instances of the phase , i.e. , we set @xmath49 in fig .",
    "1 so that @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "this assumption of no coding is realistic in the single - parameter estimation problem considered here , though it may be relaxed in more general situations .",
    "in line with our earlier remarks , a large part of our work consists in estimating the classical capacity of the channel resulting from phase modulation of the probe state according to the value of @xmath6 , while allowing arbitrary povm measurements on the modulated states .",
    "we consider the following general strategy for estimating a phase shift .",
    "an arbitrary pure probe state @xmath52 on the hilbert space @xmath53 of @xmath54 ` signal ' and @xmath55 ` idler ' modes with average energy @xmath1 in the signal modes is prepared @xcite .",
    "the signal modes each undergo phase shifting by the unknown amount @xmath56 while the idler modes remain unaffected ( see fig .  2 for the @xmath57 case )",
    "so that we have the output state    @xmath58    for @xmath59 where @xmath60 are the annihilation operators of the @xmath54 signal modes and @xmath61 is the identity operator on the @xmath55 idler modes .",
    "finally , the optimum povm is implemented on the joint state to yield the best mse estimate @xmath10 of @xmath6 .",
    "the above description corresponds to an entanglement - assisted parallel strategy considered in ref .",
    "it is also a special case of the general image sensing framework of ref .",
    "@xcite with the number of ` pixels ' @xmath62 set to one , the number of hypotheses @xmath54 , identified as the ` number ' of different phase - shift values , going to infinity , the prior probability of the ` image ' that shifts by @xmath56 set equal to @xmath7 , and the cost function taken to be the mean - squared error .    [",
    "cols=\"^ \" , ]     we now bound the second term in eq .  .",
    "consider the single - mode pure loss channel @xmath63 depicted in fig .",
    "it is readily verified that , for the input state @xmath64 , the channel outputs the state @xmath65 so that the _ entropy gain _ from input to output is precisely @xmath66 . for the channel @xmath67 of fig .  3 , holevo has shown ( see theorem 2 of @xcite ) that the _ minimum _ entropy gain @xmath68 = \\ln\\left(1-\\eta\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the infimum is over all input states in @xmath53 and therefore includes the input state of fig .  3 .",
    "we thus have , for all probe states @xmath52 , @xmath69 which , combined with , gives @xmath70 \\nonumber\\\\ & \\equiv\\overline{c}_{\\rm ph}(n_s),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is the sought upper bound on @xmath71 .",
    "the final step is to use the lower bound and the information transmission inequality to get the lower bound @xmath72}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on the mse that exhibits sql scaling @xmath48 for large @xmath1 , implying that for any nonzero amount of loss , nonclassical states of light are not much superior to coherent states for phase sensing , at least when @xmath73 .",
    "note that the bound does not reduce to eq .",
    "as @xmath74 because the estimate is not tight in that limit @xcite .",
    "the following bound applicable to lossy phase estimation that is in terms of the mean and variance of the input state and exhibits sql scaling has been obtained in @xcite:- @xmath75 the left - hand side @xmath76 is the mean - squared error achieved for a particular ( but arbitrary ) value of @xmath56 and @xmath77 is the variance of the signal photon number .",
    "this bound , based as it is on the quantum cramr - rao inequality , is valid for every value of @xmath56 provided the estimate @xmath10 is unbiased .",
    "note that , in the region of large @xmath77 , which is achievable for any finite @xmath1 @xcite , the bounds and are rather similar in form .",
    "we have developed the rate - distortion approach to lower bounds on the mse of optical phase estimation .",
    "we have obtained an h limit for lossless phase estimation and a lower bound with sql scaling in the presence of loss .",
    "it is hoped that the approach of this work can be extended to obtain performance bounds on the estimation of other system parameters using quantum states of light .",
