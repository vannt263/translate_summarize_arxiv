    "calculating the energy states for the motion of a particle in a ` simple ' one dimensional infinite square well finds its way into all standard quantum mechanics texts .",
    "but because the potential representing the walls is sharp and infinite the model has subtleties . for instance",
    "a consistent definition of a momentum operator for it is challenging @xcite .",
    "another intriguing property of the infinite well is that for certain initial states the time development of the spatial probability density can show fractal behavior @xcite .",
    "there is also the topic of wave packet revival in such a well @xcite . and",
    "the time dependence of a particle s wave function in a suddenly expanded well can show interesting features @xcite .",
    "clearly , when sharp edges and infinities are involved , care is important .    in this paper",
    "we compound the singularity by adding within the well a fixed delta function potential of arbitrary sign , strength and location . for this model , due to the containing walls , all solutions to the schrdinger equation are bound states , but the model does have its niceties .",
    "we find for instance that although , as expected for the bound states of any one - dimensional system , all of its energy eigen - states are non - degenerate , should the delta function be located at a rational fraction of the well s width , then a subset of these energies approach _ in the limit _ of strong attraction or repulsion , double degeneracy .",
    "in addition to examining several other properties and limits of the model we have computed  for both attraction and repulsion the ground state energy of the system as a function of the location of the delta function . for the case of attraction",
    "this energy has a minimum when the force center is located at the center of the well . for a wide box",
    "this minimum is nearly flat , but it becomes sharper when the well width is reduced to sizes of order of the spatial decay length characterizing the ` molecular ' size of the bound state of an attractive delta function in free space .",
    "the model has not , of course , escaped attention .",
    "patil @xcite and atkinson and crater @xcite give analyses for the case that the delta function potential is located precisely at the center of the well .",
    "bera and his co - workers @xcite place it anywhere within the well and utilize perturbation theory .",
    "joglekar @xcite computes the energy eigenvalues when it is located at irrational multiples of the well s width and considers weak and strong coupling limits .",
    "epstein @xcite uses the well with the delta function located at the center in order to gain insight into the interesting question posed by wigner @xcite as to whether the energy levels of a hydrogen atom should be derivable from second order perturbation theory in view of the fact that it is known to be proportional to the fourth power of the electron charge and therefore to the square of the coulomb interaction .",
    "we were motivated to consider the model by the long standing problem of the effects of containment on molecule states and energies dating back to work by michels @xcite , sommerfeld @xcite and their co - workers , in the early heyday of quantum mechanics , applying approximations to study what might be said to be the canonical problem  that of a hydrogen atom with its nucleus fixed at the center of an impenetrable sphere .",
    "other more recent papers discuss this model with various methods of approximation .",
    "see for instance references @xcite and , especially @xcite which includes a short review of work on this model up to 1987 .",
    "more recently changa and co - workers @xcite have applied perturbation theory to estimate the energies when the hydrogen nucleus is _ shifted _ from the center of the the spherical box .",
    "the particular advantage of the model we consider here is that no approximations are necessary to discuss the energy levels and their dependence either on the well width or on the location of the force center",
    ". it would be gratifying to be able to do the same with other model interactions .",
    "for instance one might try a ` one dimensional coulomb ' repulsion or attraction , @xmath0 , @xmath1 .",
    "but it is a sobering fact that even with no walls present , so that @xmath2 is any real number bar zero , there seems to be no final agreement for that model as to the available energy levels and corresponding eigenstates @xcite .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows .",
    "we give the general solution in sec .",
    "[ solution ] .",
    "its nature depends upon whether the ratio @xmath3 is a rational or irrational number , where @xmath4 is the delta function s position within a well of width @xmath5 . when that ratio is irrational all solutions are straightforward ` ordinary ' solutions , but when it is rational a complete set of solutions includes both the ordinary ones together with those we choose to call ` nodal ' solutions . for both cases we confirm in sec .",

    "[ weak ] and [ strong ] we consider the limits of weak and strong coupling for any location of the delta function potential within the well . in taking these limits ,",

    "[ 1/2 ] we discuss solutions for the special symmetric case that the delta function is located precisely in the middle of the well , for which @xmath3 is the rational number @xmath6 . in sec .",
    "[ gs ] we consider in some detail the ground state of the model , especially with respect to its energy dependence on the relative location @xmath3 , for various signs and strengths of the delta function potential .",

    "to summarize : when @xmath3 is irrational , solutions for @xmath103 to ( [ disp-21])or , what is equivalent , ( [ lb-1])will , for ever weaker coupling ( @xmath104 ) , approach @xmath105 for attraction or repulsion , where @xmath106 , so making up the full set of energies for a free particle in a well . also , it is easy to see , in the limit @xmath107 with @xmath108 , that solutions ( [ sol-1 ] ) approach those of the free particle in a well , eq .",

    "if instead @xmath3 should take the rational value @xmath42 , which we assume has been reduced by eliminating all common factors , then @xmath109 will vanish when and only when @xmath110 , @xmath51 .",

    "in addition to these nodal states , as we know from the argument just given for irrational @xmath3 , for large @xmath87 there exist ordinary solutions for all other integral values of @xmath12 again making up the full set of solutions for a free particle in a one - dimensional well .    for negative energies ,",
    "similar arguments show that when @xmath87 is large there are no solutions to either of eqs .",

    "now consider , for any @xmath88 , the strong coupling limit , for which the magnitude of @xmath90 is small .",
    "graphical argument shows that in this case , and only for attraction ( @xmath111 ) , there is a single state of negative energy .",
    "this is easily verified by considering eq .",
    "( [ disp-3 ] ) for small positive @xmath90 . for any value of @xmath56 between @xmath57 and @xmath112 the right - hand side of that equation is positive and monotonically increasing as a function of positive @xmath113 , from zero asymptotically to the value + 1 .",
    "thus , the single solution approaches the value @xmath114 , giving the limiting energy value @xmath115 .    except for the single bound state when the potential is attractive , for strong coupling the behavior of the oscillatory positive energy solutions to eq .",
    "( [ schrod ] ) is controlled to some extent by the product @xmath116 in the potential energy term , for which one expects that whatever its sign , as the magnitude of @xmath26 increases any ordinary solution evaluated at the potential , @xmath117 , will decrease in compensation .",
    "of course when @xmath3 is rational , the corresponding nodal solutions strictly vanish at the delta function and so are independent of the magnitude of @xmath26 , so long as it is non - zero .    for the positive energies , when @xmath87 is small , we can say , from equation ( [ dispeq ] ) , that @xmath118 is also small , so that , whatever the sign of @xmath26 , @xmath119 where @xmath120 and @xmath121 are any positive integers and @xmath122 and @xmath123 are small and vanish as @xmath124 . note that , in the limits of vanishing @xmath122 and @xmath123 , cases ( a ) and ( b ) can not both hold , for then , according to ( [ sol-1 ] ) , the wave function would strictly vanish .",
    "suppose first that @xmath3 is irrational .",
    "then the two cases given in ( [ biglambda ] ) generate , in the limit , distinct energies and do not overlap for any values of @xmath120 and @xmath121 : if this were not so , then for some integers @xmath120 and @xmath121 we would have @xmath125 and @xmath126 for the same value of @xmath35 so that @xmath3 would be rational .    cases ( a ) and ( b ) of ( [ biglambda ] ) give , in the limit of vanishing @xmath90 , nothing other than the energy levels of a free particle in separate wells of width @xmath4 and @xmath127 .",
    "we can underline this by deriving the wave functions in the strong coupling limit . for case",
    "( a ) , using in eq .",
    "( [ sol-1 ] ) the first of expressions ( [ biglambda ] ) and taking the limit @xmath128 , gives @xmath129 and , similarly , for case ( b ) : in the limit @xmath130 these states approach the ordinary well states constrained to the interval @xmath131 $ ] with quantum number @xmath121 .",
    "that the energies approach those of free particle motion in separate wells of widths @xmath4 and @xmath132 as @xmath133 ( when @xmath3 is an irrational number ) has been pointed out by joglekar @xcite .",
    "there are subtleties when @xmath3 is rational , with @xmath134 , where we assume as usual that all common factors have been eliminated from numerator and denominator . in that case , for all values of @xmath37 , we have the nodal solutions , eqs .",

    "it also shows that , with @xmath146 for example , the double degeneracy at @xmath153 ( that occurs _ in the limit _",

    "[ gs ] .    to conclude the paper we should like to make a few remarks of a purely mathematical nature concerning the model ,",
    "most of which remains to be done .",
    "first we prove that the hamiltonian , properly defined mathematically , is self adjoint .",
    "as the reader will know , self adjointness is that subtle property of a symmetric ( hermitian ) operator that guarantees that the operator can be exponentiated . for the hamiltonian ,",
    "this condition is necessary and sufficient to guarantee a unique time translation group . for our formal hamiltonian , which we here denote @xmath268",

    "have a first derivative @xmath271 which satisfies the discontinuity boundary condition at @xmath14 .",

    "it is this extension that we take as the mathematically proper hamiltonian @xmath259 . for details of the extension",
    "we recommend davies @xcite and  124 of riesz and sz .-",

    "this leaves the following to prove : the spectrum of @xmath259 consists only of eigenvalues , indeed of those eigenvalues we have obtained earlier and only those .",
