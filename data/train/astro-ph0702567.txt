    "certain models , such as supersymmetric extensions to the standard model of particle physics , predict a new particle , the neutralino , which has all the properties required of a dark matter candidate .",
    "it will form halos around galaxies and annihilate pairwise into known particles . at the end of their decay chains , positrons and electrons",
    "will be produced in equal numbers . since there is no other known primary source of positrons in the galaxy ,",
    "positrons provide an excellent probe for the indirect detection of dark matter .",
    "the observation of an excess over the expected secondary flux by the heat@xcite and ams-01@xcite experiments has sparked some excitement but it needs to be confirmed by a precise measurement .",
    "an experiment designed to measure the positron component in the cosmic rays has to fulfill several crucial requirements :    * the geometrical acceptance needs to be larger than @xmath4 due to the small flux of positrons . *",
    "a suppression of the predominant proton background of @xmath5 has to be achieved . *",
    "a good momentum resolution is necessary for charge sign determination and subsequent electron suppression .    the pebs detector has been designed to meet these requirements .",
    "we have conducted a full simulation of the behavior of the experiment using the geant4 package@xcite . in addition",
    ", key elements have been verified in a testbeam in october 2006 at cern .",

    ", a high - altitude balloon is chosen .",
    "mission durations of around 40  days can be reached by traveling with the circular arctic winds around the north or south pole@xcite .",
    "the geometrical acceptance of the detector is limited by the weight and power constraints imposed by the carrier system .",
    "the most important contributions to the overall weight are the magnet weight and the weight of the calorimeter with @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively .",
    "the power consumption is dominated by the @xmath13 needed for the tracker which has roughly 50000 individual readout channels .",

    ", the uncertainty in momentum determination is minimized@xcite .",
    "silicon photomultipliers@xcite have the virtues of being insensitive to magnetic fields , having high quantum efficiency , as well as compactness and auto - calibration .",

    "the detailed analysis of the data gathered is presented elsewhere@xcite .",
    "a dedicated monte carlo simulation , again using the geant4 package , has been developed for comparison to and generalization of the testbeam results .",

    "a preliminary cut - based analysis has been performed to study the proton rejection of this setup . for each event ,",
    "a shower fit using a standard gamma function parameterization has been performed and the following variables have been used to distinguish positrons from protons :    * @xmath46-matching : the fitted shower energy has to match the reconstructed momentum in the tracker . *",
    "@xmath47 : the fitted shower maximum must be at an appropriate depth in the calorimeter . * the ratio of shower energy within one molire radius from the shower axis has to be characteristic for an electromagnetic shower .",
