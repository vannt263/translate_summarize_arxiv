    "groups of galaxies are the characteristic structures which have formed by the present epoch , and are believed to contain the bulk of the matter in the universe @xcite . as such ,",
    "an understanding of the universe requires an understanding of galaxy groups .",
    "the depth of the potential wells of groups is similar to that of individual galaxies , and galaxy velocities within groups are only a few hundred km  s@xmath1 . under these circumstances",
    ", galaxies can interact strongly with one another , and with the group potential ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "hence , not only are groups the most common environment for galaxies , but they provide an environment which has a strong effect on galaxy properties , and which is itself evolving , as groups collapse , virialise and grow through mergers and accretion .    despite the crucial role played by groups in cosmic structure formation and evolution ,",
    "they have received relatively little attention compared to larger clusters .",
    "this is at least partly due to the fact that typical groups may contain only a handful of bright galaxies in their inner regions . in optical data ,",
    "groups are therefore often difficult to detect with confidence in projection .",
    "x - ray emission from a hot intragroup medium ( igm ) provides a much more reliable method of detecting the potential well of a virialised group .",
    "some earlier works based on pointed _ rosat _ x - ray observations utilized this to study the global properties of groups and those of their member galaxies in a coherent manner @xcite .",
    "however , although care had been taken to include groups spanning a wide range of properties , as in the study of @xcite , from a statistical viewpoint these works all suffered from the fact that _ rosat _ only targeted a heterogeneous sample of hand - picked groups .",
    "x - ray investigations of optically selected group samples include those of @xcite , and later @xcite , who invoked data from the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( rass ) to study a redshift - selected , unbiased sample of groups in x - rays .",
    "however , no detailed information on the galaxy dynamics within these groups was extracted .",
    "@xcite also employed rass data to investigate the x - ray properties of a sample of groups , drawn from the optically selected and statistically complete poor cluster catalogue of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this work furthermore included a detailed investigation of the galaxy dynamics within the groups , though the systems were originally selected by photometric enhancements and were not based on velocity information .",
    "rass data also formed the basis for the search for x - ray gas in the optically selected @xcite catalogue of groups conducted by @xcite , a work later augmented by @xcite , who included pointed rosat data . even in the latter study , however , the majority ( roughly two - thirds ) of the groups only had rass coverage . due to the shallow rass exposures of typically a few hundred seconds , the x - ray properties of groups with @xmath2  erg  @xmath1",
    "could generally not be investigated in these studies . moreover , in many cases the data only allowed for a detection of hot intragroup gas , whereas no detailed characterization of gas properties could be carried out . a further concern for rass",
    " based results for the diffuse x - ray luminosity @xmath3 from groups is the potential danger of contamination from active galactic nuclei due to the broad point spread function ( psf ) of the _ rosat _ pspc at large off - axis angles .    with the exception of dedicated large - scale structure surveys ( e.g. , @xcite ) , more recent observations with _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ have largely been targeting groups already studied by _ rosat _ in pointed observations or serendipitously detected in x - rays as part of the rass .",
    "it is not clear to what extent these groups , most of which are x - ray selected , can be seen as representative of the overall group population at low redshift",
    ". studies of clusters of galaxies indicate that x - ray selection could incorporate a serious bias , with x - ray and optically selected samples showing highly disparate x - ray properties and in some cases @xcite being largely non - overlapping .",
    "@xcite found that a significant fraction of optically selected clusters do not have a clear x - ray counterpart in _ rosat _ data , even though the physical reality of the x - ray faint systems were confirmed by spectroscopic follow - up . a similar conclusion , although based on optical multi - colour imaging rather than spectroscopy , was reached by @xcite using _ chandra _ data .",
    "the optically selected high - redshift clusters of @xcite were found to be x - ray underluminous for their velocity dispersion @xmath4 , deviating from the @xmath3@xmath4 relation derived for rich , nearby x - ray clusters .",
    "a similar result was shown for colour - selected clusters by @xcite , while @xcite found that a subset of their abell clusters were x - ray underluminous with respect to their virial mass .",
    "these results clearly suggest that x - ray selection could provide a biased picture of the cluster population , and there is little reason to assert that the situation for groups should be significantly different .",
    "given the lower x - ray luminosities of groups , such a bias is likely to be even stronger for these systems .",
    "as a consequence of the fact that most x - ray studies of groups have either been concentrating on x - ray selected targets picked from a variety of different group catalogues , or have employed the shallow rass data to investigate group x - ray emission , we currently have no _ unbiased _ census of the properties of hot gas and their relation to the dynamics of galaxies within galaxy groups .",
    "the advent of large redshift surveys , coupled with the high sensitivity , spatial resolution , and spectral capability of _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ , has made it possible to remedy this situation .",
    "groups can be selected in redshift space , the properties of any hot igm can be assessed using deep x - ray data , and group dynamics can be studied with multi - slit spectrographs .",
    "we have launched a project to take advantage of this situation , by targeting a statistically representative sample of groups with both _ xmm - newton _ and the imacs multi - object camera and spectrograph @xcite , installed on the 6.5-m baade / magellan telescope at las campanas .",
    "the primary aim of the _ xi _ project is to understand the nature and evolution of the galaxy group population , and to study the way in which the properties of groups are related to those of their member galaxies .",
    "by performing a sensitive test for the presence of any hot igm in the selected groups , one of the key outcomes of this project will be a reliable estimate of the fraction of optically selected groups which actually contain a hot igm .",
    "another issue to be addressed is whether the properties of any hot x - ray gas can be used as an evolutionary tracer of the dynamical state of a group .",
    "the thrust of the present paper is to provide an initial attack on these questions , using the results obtained for the first four groups observed by _",
    "xmm _ as part of the project .",
    "the large collecting area and field of view of _ xmm _ makes it the ideal x - ray instrument for this study .",
    "imacs has a field of view perfectly matched to that of _ xmm _",
    "( @xmath5  arcmin in both cases ) , and allows us to obtain several hundred spectra over this entire field in a single exposure , down to @xmath6 at the selected sample redshift of @xmath7 .",
    "we assume @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and a hubble constant of @xmath10  km  s@xmath1  mpc .",
    "the virial radius @xmath11 of each group can then be identified with @xmath12 , the radius enclosing a mean density of 100 times the critical density @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "if the dark matter density of the groups follows an nfw profile @xcite with concentration parameters in the plausible range @xmath14 @xcite , we then have @xmath15 . in the adopted cosmology",
    ", the characteristic redshift of our sample of @xmath16 corresponds to a luminosity distance @xmath17  mpc , and 1  arcmin to @xmath18  kpc .",
    "a redshift - selected sample provides the best basis for a study of this type .",
    "x - ray selection is impractical , due to the lack of wide - area high - sensitivity data , and would in any case fail to detect groups which are collapsing but do not yet have virialised cores .",
    "we therefore selected our sample from the catalogue of 2209 groups derived by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter mz ) from a friends - of - friends ( fof ) clustering analysis ( optimised by reference to cosmological simulations ) on the first ( 100-k ) data release from the 2df galaxy redshift survey @xcite .    from this large group catalogue ,",
    "we selected a sample of 25 systems which satisfied the following additional criteria : ( i ) redshift @xmath19 : this narrow slice puts all groups on an equal observational footing at a redshift where the characteristic radius @xmath20 of groups of @xmath21  mpc corresponds to 13  arcmin and so is well matched to both the _ xmm _ and imacs fields of view . using a narrow redshift interval",
    "further has the advantage of circumventing a typical problem associated with fof - catalogues , namely that the fof linking length grows with @xmath22 , implying that the properties of fof - selected groups may vary systematically with redshift .",
    "( ii ) velocity dispersion @xmath23  km  s@xmath1 : limiting our study to poor systems , which are the most common ( containing more than half of all galaxies , see @xcite and @xcite ) and provide the environment in which dynamical evolution is most rapid , and the dispersion in observed properties is greatest .",
    "( iii ) number of spectroscopically confirmed 2df member galaxies @xmath24 : reducing the danger of including groups which are not real physical associations , by allowing only systems which incorporate at least five 2df galaxies .",
    "@xmath25-body simulations show that fof - groups with @xmath26 almost always correspond to gravitationally bound structures rather than being unbound density fluctuations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "( iv ) redshift completeness : we avoid the edges of the 2df survey area , and regions with poor completeness in the 100-k data release .    within these constraints",
    ", we selected our sample of 25 groups entirely at random . since our aim is to explore the full population of optically selected systems , we deliberately did not attempt to apply any further constraints of regularity , optical luminosity or dynamical status .",

    "also note that , despite the fact that some of the groups are rather compact as judged from the mz virial radius , we find that none of the _ xi _ groups would satisfy the compact group criteria introduced by @xcite .",
    "this is in all cases because they fail to meet the compactness criterion @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the total @xmath33-band magnitude per arcsec@xmath34 of the galaxies within 3  mag of the brightest one , averaged over the ( circular ) angular extent of the subgroup defined by these galaxies .

    "summarizing the x - ray properties of the hot igm in the four groups , we find that two groups , mz  5383 and mz  9307 , show no detectable diffuse emission , whereas mz  4577 shows some evidence of igm emission though this is not significant at the @xmath35 level .",
    "only in one system , mz  9014 , do we detect some irregular emission at @xmath36  significance .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of this system is among the lowest found for any x - ray detected group , and since its hot gas is clearly not in hydrostatic equilibrium , no x - ray mass analysis was attempted .    on the basis of their velocity dispersions ,",
    "all four groups are remarkably x - ray underluminous with respect to typical x - ray selected groups , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig , lxsig ] .",
    "this plot shows the corresponding results from the gems sample of @xcite , along with several observationally derived @xmath3@xmath37 relations spanning a large range of derived slopes , from @xmath38 @xcite to @xmath39 @xcite ( all normalized to our adopted value of @xmath40 ) . even when comparing to the combined results from these highly disparate data sets , the _ xi _ groups emerge as significantly x - ray underluminous for their velocity dispersions .",
    "this is particularly true in light of the fact that , apart from the @xcite relation , the x - ray luminosities underlying the @xmath41@xmath37 relations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig , lxsig ] have generally not been extrapolated to @xmath42 .",
    "doing so would raise the normalization of the relations , thus aggravating the discrepancy with respect to the _ xi _ groups .",
    "it is perhaps also surprising that it is the two _ xi _ groups with the largest values of @xmath4 that remain undetected in the x - ray .",
    "these results indicate already that the full _ xi _ sample will have properties quite different from the heterogeneous group samples studied in the past , and that these earlier samples provided a biased view of the group population .",
    "given the importance of this conclusion , it seems worth addressing the robustness of the result shown in fig .",
    "[ fig , lxsig ] , before proceeding to investigate its source of origin .",
    "one potential concern is that @xmath3 of our groups has been evaluated inside a fiducial radius of @xmath43 ( assumed roughly equal to @xmath42 ) , for physical consistency and straightforward comparison to the results of @xcite .",
    "the reliability of the virial radii adopted from mz for this purpose could be questioned , as these are in some cases based on only five galaxies .",
    "this issue will be addressed in more detail when improved membership statistics become available for a larger sample of _ xi _ groups , but we note for now that the main conclusion  that our four groups are x - ray underluminous for their velocity dispersions  is clearly robust to reasonable changes in @xmath11 .",
    "another issue is whether the velocity dispersions could be overestimated in our analysis .",
    "we tested this for the three groups with available imacs velocities , by estimating errors on galaxy velocities both from the template fitting code and from the variation in derived redshifts resulting from manually fitting multiple line features .",
    "reassuringly , the resulting values of @xmath4 were entirely consistent .",
    "the argument that @xmath4 could be artificially boosted by contamination from interlopers could possibly be justified for a single group , but hardly for all four , and certainly not by a factor of 23 required to bring mz  5383 , mz  9014 , and mz  9307 into formal agreement with the @xmath3@xmath30 relation of @xcite . for mz  9307 ,",
    "the velocity dispersion adopted from mz could potentially be unreliable due to the small number of galaxies involved .",
    "however , mz derive @xmath30 for groups with @xmath44 using the gapper estimator ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , which should improve robustness in @xmath4estimates for poorly sampled systems .",
    "the consistency of the imacs results for @xmath4 with the corresponding mz values for the three other groups also suggests that the adopted velocity dispersion of mz  9307 can not be seriously biased .      with the robustness of the result shown in fig .",
    "[ fig , lxsig ] reasonably well established , the question remains how to interpret the lack of significant x - ray emission in our groups , and whether this lack of emission is coupled to their dynamical state .",
    "it is most unlikely that the two undetected groups are not gravitationally bound , since ( as mentioned in section  [ sec , sample ] ) only groups with number density contrasts @xmath45 have been included in the mz catalogue .",
    "this leaves at least three possible explanations for the lack of significant igm emission in our sample .",
    "\\(i ) the groups could be in the process of collapsing for the first time , in which case the present velocity dispersion could be a poor proxy of the depth of the gravitational potential of the group or the temperature of its x - ray gas .",
    "this scenario allows for significant amounts of intragroup gas , which , however , would be more uniformly distributed than in collapsed groups and may not yet have been shock - heated to the virial temperature of the final system . in this case",
    "one might also expect to see evidence of dynamical substructure in the galaxy distribution . to investigate this , we plot velocity histograms of the groups in fig .",
    "[ fig , velhist ] .",
    "there is generally some indication , particularly for mz  5383 , of a central gap in the histogram .",
    "the result for mz  4577 also suggests a bimodal velocity distribution , with a subgroup of four galaxies separated from the remaining nine galaxies by @xmath46  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "these features could be associated with the merging of two subgroups , but there is no convincing evidence that any apparent velocity substructures are localized on the sky in any of the groups . however , given the fairly modest number of galaxies found in each group , it is likely that general conclusions about velocity substructure in these four groups can not be reached on the basis of individual velocity histograms . to verify this",
    ", we confirmed , using the data from @xcite , that apparently virialised systems with a comparable number of confirmed members , such as hcg  42 and ngc  4325 , can show velocity histograms with features similar to those seen in fig .",
    "[ fig , velhist ] .",
    "potentially , some insight into the dynamics of the groups can still be gained by combining all the velocity measurements . to this end , we constructed a pseudo - group containing all confirmed member galaxies , by normalizing the galaxy velocities shown in fig .",
    "[ fig , velhist ] to the velocity dispersion of the relevant group . fig .",
    "[ fig , velhist_norm ] shows the resulting stacked histogram of the 65 normalized galaxy velocities .",
    "it is clear that the central deficit of galaxy velocities persists in this representation . using a k  s test , we find that the probability that the normalized velocities have been drawn from a gaussian with unit variance @xmath47 ^ 2 $ ] , is @xmath48 for all 65 galaxies , decreasing to @xmath49 if including only the 58 galaxies with imacs velocity measurements .",
    "although still dealing with a relatively small number of galaxies , this result may suggest that the groups , as a class , are still in the process of dynamical relaxation .",
    "a more detailed dynamical analysis of the _ xi _ sample will be undertaken when results for the full sample become available . within the framework of the present analysis",
    ", we note that a picture in which the groups are still collapsing also has support from studies of other group samples . these include both purely optical analyses ( e.g.@xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) and x - ray / optical comparisons ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , @xcite infer a limiting number density contrast of @xmath50 for their p group subsample , comparable to that of the mz catalogue , and estimate that most of these groups are in the phase of collapse .",
    "@xcite investigated rass data for a sample of spectroscopically confirmed abell clusters and found that 50 out of 138 clusters were x - ray underluminous for their optically derived virial mass .",
    "although detecting no obvious optical substructure in their individual x - ray faint clusters , their superior statistics enabled these authors to conclude , on the basis of the position and velocity distributions of the cluster members , that these systems as a class are most likely still collapsing .",
    "further support for ongoing collapse of a considerable fraction of the group population comes from cosmological simulations , which suggest that 3050 per cent of all groups selected via standard fof - algorithms could be collapsing for the first time at the present epoch ( j.  sommer - larsen , priv .",
    "comm . ) .",
    "\\(ii ) a second explanation for the general lack of significant x - ray emission in the groups is that the gravitational potentials of these groups are too shallow to heat the intragroup gas to x - ray temperatures . as in scenario ( i ) above , there could be plenty of intragroup gas , but in this case its temperature would largely remain too low ( @xmath51  k ) to render it detectable in these observations .",
    "however , given the high values measured for the velocity dispersions of our groups , this explanation seems unattractive , and , as has already been discussed , the velocity dispersions of our groups are unlikely to be substantially overestimated .",
    "the fact that we _ do _ detect hot gas in two of the groups also suggests that this scenario can not offer an exhaustive explanation , even if assuming that the measured velocity dispersions are poor proxies of the total group mass .",
    "the long mean cooling times derived for the x - ray detected gas indicate that the gas is emitting inefficiently in the x - ray band due to its density , rather than temperature , being surprisingly low .",
    "the fact that mz  9014 is underluminous relative to the expectation from the @xmath3@xmath52 relation but is consistent with the @xmath53@xmath52 relation ( cf .",
    "section  [ sec , mz9014 ] ) , seems to support this interpretation .",
    "\\(iii ) alternatively , the groups could be x - ray faint because many collapsed groups simply contain very little intragroup gas .",
    "our unbiased selection could thus be picking up such systems because they are more numerous than x - ray bright groups .",
    "one mechanism which could give rise to this situation is strong galactic feedback ejecting a significant fraction of the original igm from the group potential .",
    "however , that would leave the challenge of explaining why feedback would be so much stronger in some groups as to reduce the x - ray detectable hot gas mass by 12 orders of magnitude relative to other systems with potential wells of similar depth . moreover ,",
    "since the formation of elliptical galaxies is expected to generate more feedback than that of spirals @xcite , strong group - wide feedback would probably require a galaxy population with a low spiral fraction @xmath54 .",
    "if tentatively identifying those 2df group galaxies with values of the spectral type parameter @xmath55 as spirals ( see @xcite ) , then the mean spiral fraction of our four groups is @xmath56  per  cent .",
    "such a large value of @xmath57 may not be easily reconciled with the notion that galactic feedback has ejected much of the igm from the groups .",
    "we note that @xcite detected x - ray emission in rass data from only 42 out of a statistically complete sample of 260 groups , suggesting that @xmath58  per  cent of their groups do not contain a hot igm .",
    "however , due to the very shallow rass exposures , these authors could not study x - ray emission from groups with @xmath59  erg  s@xmath1 , which would be expected to be more common .",
    "in fact , based on the expectation from x - ray bright groups , more than half of the 25 _ xi _ groups are expected to show x - ray emission around or below this limit ( cf .",
    "[ fig , sigmarv ] and [ fig , lxsig ] ) . until a larger sample of such groups has been studied using more sensitive x - ray data , it seems premature to accept scenario ( iii ) without considering viable alternatives .    in summary",
    ", we can not at this stage exclude the possibility that the surprisingly low diffuse x - ray luminosity of our groups is due to any igm being either largely absent or too cold to produce copious x - ray emission . in order to help constrain the _ total _ gas content of the _ xi _ groups ,",
    "we have commenced a programme of hi imaging of the groups using the giant metrewave radio telescope .",
    "when h i results for a significant number of groups become available , we will be in a better position to assess the validity of scenarios ii ) and iii ) above . until",
    "then , we find the idea that the groups could still be in the process of virialisation more attractive .",
    "in contrast to the other scenarios discussed , this explanation draws support from both cosmological simulations and other observational group studies , without facing any immediate challenges .",
    "we note that the morphological composition and the likely dynamical status of these groups suggest an analogy to the local group ( lg ) of galaxies , which consists of three spirals brighter than @xmath60 , with a varied assortment of early and late - type dwarfs , and is collapsing for the first time . although having a low velocity dispersion of @xmath61  km  s@xmath1 , comparable to those of the lowest-@xmath4 groups in the _ xi _ sample ( fig .  [ fig , sigmarv ] ) , the total lg mass of @xmath62  m@xmath63 ( e.g.  @xcite ) suggests a mass overdensity with respect to the critical density of @xmath64 , within the region occupied by the milky way and m31 subgroups .",
    "the equivalent galaxy number density contrast in the adopted cosmology of @xmath65 suggests that the lg would in fact meet the overdensity criterion for inclusion in the mz catalogue .",
    "though no x - ray emitting hot igm has yet been detected in the lg , which is unlikely to have a diffuse x - ray luminosity of more than a few times @xmath66  erg  s@xmath1 @xcite , recent detections of zero - redshift ovi and ovii absorption lines in _ fuse _ and _ chandra _ observations of quasars suggest the presence of an lg intergalactic medium of electron density @xmath67  @xmath68 and temperature @xmath69  k ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "this is consistent with the low fluxes we observe for our groups .",
    "our hi studies of the _ xi _ groups will help us compare their cold gas content with that of the lg .      as will be described in more detail in a subsequent paper , a substantial fraction of the _ xi _ group members are found from our imacs spectroscopy to be emission - line galaxies . in particular ,",
    "strong optical emission lines are found in roughly half of the confirmed member galaxies in the three groups with imacs data discussed here .",
    "hence , star - forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei are seen in all of these groups . given this ,",
    "it is perhaps surprising that out of a total of 58 confirmed group galaxies , we detect x - ray emission above a few times @xmath66  erg  s@xmath1 in only three of them ( cf.tables  [ tab , opt ] and [ tab , results ] ) .",
    "these three galaxies are all ellipticals , displaying no evidence for significant optical emission lines .",
    "their x - ray luminosities are fairly typical of moderately x - ray bright ellipticals , and their measured luminosities and temperatures compare well to the expectations from the @xmath41@xmath52 relation derived for ellipticals by @xcite .",
    "the galaxies that show agn - like optical emission in our groups must have x - ray emission below our detection limit of @xmath70  erg  s@xmath1 , and their nuclei could be related to the class of low - luminosity agn seen in some nearby galaxies ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    from an optically selected sample of groups having pointed _ rosat _ pspc coverage , @xcite found that groups with detectable x - ray emission typically have a bright ( @xmath71 ) elliptical at the centre of the x - ray emission .",
    "in addition to the unexpectedly faint igm emission of the four _ xi _ groups studied here , another potential difference between these and more x - ray luminous systems is therefore that none of our groups hosts a dominant central elliptical galaxy . in two of the groups , including the x - ray detected mz  9014 , the optically most luminous galaxy is in fact a spiral .",
    "none of the ellipticals is 1  mag brighter than @xmath72 , and we note in particular that the brightest 2df galaxy in mz  9307 is @xmath73  mag _ fainter _ than @xmath72 .",
    "the absence of a dominant elliptical in the groups also seems to support the hypothesis that the groups are still collapsing , since such galaxies are probably formed via mergers in dense environments .",
    "we should also note , though , that the two x - ray detected groups , mz  4577 and mz  9014 , are not the only systems known to show diffuse intragroup x - ray emission which is not peaking on a central , bright early - type galaxy .",
    "other examples include the spiral - dominated hickson compact groups hcg  16 @xcite , hcg  57 @xcite , and the well - studied hcg  92 ( stephan s quintet ; @xcite ) , as well as the early - type dominated hcg  37 @xcite .",
    "these groups all exhibit low diffuse x - ray luminosities in the range @xmath74  15@xmath75  erg  s@xmath1 , comparable to @xmath3 of the x - ray detected _ xi _ groups .",
    "systems like the hickson groups , likely to represent groups close to maximum collapse , are not very common in the nearby universe , however .",
    "for example , we find that only about @xmath76  per  cent of the groups in the mz catalogue ( and , as mentioned in section  [ sec , sample ] , none of the _ xi _ groups ) satisfy the @xcite criteria . outside hickson s catalogue , other examples",
    "are ngc  7777 and shk  202 @xcite .",
    "however , the number of such systems in the literature is still very low , placing mz  4577 and mz  9014 in an exclusive club .",
    "coupled with the results described in section  [ sec , comparison ] , this is a further indication that the _ xi _ project is targeting a class of groups not previously studied in much detail in x - rays .",
    "as part of an ongoing effort to investigate the x - ray and optical properties of a substantial , statistically unbiased , and kinematically selected sample of galaxy groups , for the first time using deep x - ray data , we have performed _ xmm - newton _ observations of the first four groups in this sample . in two of the groups , we detect an x - ray emitting intragroup medium , with luminosities among the lowest found for x - ray detected groups so far .",
    "the two other groups observed here remain undetected in the x - ray , and all four groups are found to be x - ray underluminous for their velocity dispersions when compared to expectations from x - ray bright groups .",
    "furthermore , none of the groups hosts a dominant elliptical galaxy at the centre of the x - ray emission .",
    "our results therefore suggest that the nature of the igm in these optically selected groups may be very different from that seen in standard x - ray selected group samples .",
    "the fact that we are finding some of the faintest igm yet seen in groups in our first four observations clearly demonstrates that the _ xi _ project is exploring new parameter space .",
    "it also establishes that the predominantly x - ray selected group samples studied in the past with e.g.  _ rosat _ were not representative of the overall group population .",
    "in contrast , the unbiased redshift selection employed in the _ xi _ project appears to be targeting a different class of groups not previously studied in much detail .",
    "the low levels of igm emission in the groups could be an indication that i ) the groups are in the process of collapsing for the first time , ii ) the gravitational potentials are too shallow for the gas to emit much x - ray emission ( i.e.  the gas is essentially too cool to produce x - rays ) , or iii ) there is simply little or no intragroup gas .",
    "we find the first explanation to be the more attractive , at least until the validity of the other scenarios can be more firmly addressed by subjecting a larger sample of optically selected groups to deep x - ray observations .",
    "the idea that many groups are collapsing for the first time at the present epoch is also consistent with expectations from other optical group studies and with results of cosmological simulations .",
    "in contrast to the more well - studied class of x - ray bright groups , the type of groups studied in this paper truly represents the most common galaxy environments in the universe . investigating the detailed properties of a larger sample of such groups is therefore crucial if one is to obtain an unbiased understanding of the nature of the group population and a census of the distribution of baryons in the universe .",

    "<S> here , x - ray and optical data of the first four galaxy groups observed as part of the project are presented . in two of the groups we detect diffuse emission with a luminosity of @xmath0  erg  s@xmath1 , among the lowest found for any x - ray detected group thus far , with a comparable upper limit for the other two . </S>",
    "<S> compared to typical x - ray selected groups of similar velocity dispersion , these four systems are all surprisingly x - ray faint . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss possible explanations for the lack of significant x - ray emission in the groups , concluding that these systems are most likely collapsing for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> our results strongly suggest that , unlike our current optically selected sample , previous x - ray selected group samples represented a biased picture of the group population . </S>",
