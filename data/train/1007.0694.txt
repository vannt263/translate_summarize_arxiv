    "these rates are given by the transition rates connected to the scattering processes of laser cooling , multiplied by the population of the vibrational levels .",
    "for a single atomic dipole involved in the laser cooling , the strengths of the red and blue sidebands integrated over all directions of emission , is essentially given by these heating and cooling rates , which are equal . for multiple atomic transitions participating in the cooling ,",
    "the motional sidebands reflect only the scattering processes belonging to the considered dipole , and thus their strengths can differ . in the competition of the two cooling mechanisms , the sideband cooling of the standing wave laser coupling transition @xmath26 dominates for the parameters used here . as a result ,",
    "in the spectrum of this transition we observe a strongly pronounced blue sideband and an almost completely suppressed red sideband .",
    "this asymmetry is balanced out by the other situation in the angle - integrated spectrum of the doppler cooled transition .",
    "our intuitive explanation is also supported by an analytical calculation , which can be done at leading order in the saturation parameter @xmath176 , and is reported in appendix  [ app : evinttraces ] .",
    "the situation encountered here is reminiscent to the case of cavity cooling of a trapped atom @xcite , where also two decay channels  the spontaneous emission of the atom and the cavity loss  exist .",
    "the pedestal appearing at the location of the blue sideband is an inelastic contribution to the spectrum , and arises from the broadening of the blue sideband transition due to the coupling with state @xmath20 .",

    "similarly , our results show that @xmath183 : all the spectral components of this transition are due to the mechanical effects of the second laser , and disappear for @xmath184 .",

    "this quantity additionally scales the components of the spectra which are related to mechanical effects , as shown in app .",

    "the spectral features connected with the quantum jumps are optimally observed when the wave vector of the standing wave is aligned with the atomic motion ( @xmath120 ) and the detector angle @xmath15 is at the maximum of the dipole emission pattern . in the regime",
    "considered here , the orientation of the running wave laser is less essential , best visibility we found for illumination along the axis of motion ( @xmath185 ) .",
    "we have theoretically studied the resonance fluorescence from a confined atom in a setup , where one could observe quantum jumps which are solely due to the mechanical effects of light . in the limit in which the lasers driving the atom also cool the motion ,",
    "we have derived the time scales of the bright and dark periods of the emitted intensity and the corresponding features in the spectrum of resonance fluorescence .",
    "the latter is a pedestal appearing in correspondence of the elastic peak for the radiation emitted along the bright transition , whose height is proportional to the temperature and degree of localization of the atom about the trap center .",
    "we now discuss the experimental feasibility of this scheme .",
    "the setup we have considered assumes a @xmath186-configuration of levels , where one of the excited state is metastable .",
    "the atom is doppler cooled along the optically allowed transition , while the transition which is metastable is driven by a standing - wave laser . in this work we assumed that the linewidth of this transition is much narrower than the trap frequency , so that the corresponding laser essentially drives the red sideband",
    "this is however not an essential requirement .",
    "the important condition is that the linewidth of the metastable state is significantly smaller than the rate of photon scattering along the allowed , optical transition .",

    "since state @xmath191 has a lifetime of the order of a second , this could be quenched by coupling to @xmath192 , thereby not affecting the quantum jump scheme .    while the motivation of this work is mainly to investigate some fundamental properties of quantum jumps in resonance fluorescence",
    ", one could consider which outlooks on quantum engineering this work may offer . beyond the possibility to extract temperature and localization of an atom , one could consider a setup in which the quantum jump corresponds to the transition to a nonclassical state of the motion . in this case , this would allow one to post - selecting the quantum state , in the spirit of the proposal in ref .",
