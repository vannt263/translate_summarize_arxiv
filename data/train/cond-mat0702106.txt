    "in the investigation of the properties of vortices and vortex lattices in type - ii superconductors , direct imaging of the vortex positions at the surface of the material can be a useful tool . for magnetic fields of practical interest",
    "the distance between vortex lines becomes small ( roughly 50  nm at 1  t ) and scanning tunnelling microscopy ( stm ) gains an advantage over magnetic imaging techniques since stm is only sensitive to the vortex cores .",
    "a disadvantage of the technique is that the sample surface needs to be clean and conducting . for crystals ,",
    "this can be done by breaking or cleaving , which has been successful for such materials as nbse@xmath2 @xcite or bi@xmath2ca@xmath2srcu@xmath2o@xmath3 @xcite . for thin films no such simple preparation method exists and since surfaces easily oxidize , reports on vortex imaging on superconducting films are relatively few .",
    "one way to overcome this problem is to protect the film surface with a thin capping layer of a noble metal such as au . as we showed before , this works well on films of @xmath0-mo@xmath1ge , a weakly pinning superconductor , capped with 3  nm au and clear images of the vortex structure could be obtained by mapping the proximity - induced gap at the au surface @xcite .",
    "the au layer should be flat , which means that au should be wetting the surface during deposition , and the interface should be transparent .",
    "neither condition is always met .",
    "for instance , although a reasonably flat au film forms on films of strongly pinning nbn , spectroscopy shows very unclear vortex images , presumably because the rough nbn surface causes a bad nbn / au interface .",
    "this can be overcome by depositing a thin ( 20 nm ) film of @xmath0-mo@xmath1ge  followed by the au protection layer .",
    "clear vortex contrast could again be obtained , and showed the nbn vortex lattice ( vl ) to be completely disordered @xcite .",
    "+ this use of a @xmath0-mo@xmath1ge / au template layer assumes that the vortex positions as fixed by the nbn layer are transferred in true fashion to the au surface , which should be the case when the @xmath0-mo@xmath1ge  layer is too thin to yield appreciable bending or rearrangement of the vortex cores . in this work",
    "we further address this issue , which consists of two parts .",
    "the first involves the vortex - vortex interactions within the template layer , which might lead to reorientation of the vortices in that layer or , more specifically , to the recurrence of the well - ordered @xmath0-mo@xmath1ge  vl .",
    "the second question is with respect to the coupling of the vortices in the two superconducting layers .",
    "if the interface has a metallic character , the proximity effect will play a major role in coupling the vortices ; if the surface of the host superconductor is insulating , as is often the case in oxide materials , the coupling may become of the josephson type , or merely electromagnetic , and this can allow freedom for the vortex in the template to move with respect to the one in the host .",
    "+ the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "we first introduce the experimental techniques and the data analysis process , in particular the use of the autocorrelation function .",
    "then we address the question of the length scale on which the disorder injected by the nbn layer is healed in the @xmath0-mo@xmath1ge  template layer , by measuring samples with different ( template ) thicknesses @xmath4 of the @xmath0-mo@xmath1ge - layer .",
    "we show data on the variation of the autocorrelation functions as function of @xmath4 , and we discuss them by considering the bending modes of vortex lines in @xmath0-mo@xmath1ge . then we present experimental results on the issue of coupling , by studying heterostructure samples with a badly conducting or insulating interface layer . in the discussion , we consider the strength of the electromagnetic and josephson coupling forces which couple the vortex segments in the two superconducting layers .",
    "this coupling is in competition with the inter - vortex forces within the template layer , which tend to reorient the vortices to their triangular arrangement .",
    "in this work @xmath0-mo@xmath1ge  is used as a template layer because of its suitable properties . with a ginzburg - landau parameter",
    "@xmath5 it is a strong type - ii superconductor , while its amorphous structure makes it a relatively weakly pinning material .",
    "furthermore , its large london penetration depth @xmath6 yields a small tilt modulus @xmath7 , which means that the vl retains a two - dimensional ( 2d ) character up to quite large thicknesses , as will be discussed below .",
    "finally , amorphous materials show very flat surface characteristics .",
    "the @xmath0-mo@xmath1ge  layers were rf - sputtered from a composite mo / ge target in ar atmosphere .",
    "the film thickness ranged from 25  nm to 100  nm .",
    "when necessary , we denote the thickness by @xmath0-mo@xmath1ge(x ) , with x the thickness in nm . during sputtering",
    "the substrate was water - cooled and after each minute of sputtering , and interruption of 1 minute was made to prevent heating and possible recrystallization of the films .",
    "the sputtering rate was chosen as @xmath8  nm / minute .",
    "the superconducting transition temperature @xmath9 was 5.7  k for the 25  nm films , increasing up to @xmath10  k for @xmath11  nm , after which @xmath9 became constant .",
    "the critical current for onset of vortex motion for a 500  nm thick film was found to be or the order of @xmath12  a / m@xmath13 . also relevant",
    "is the value of the critical field @xmath14 at the measurement temperature of 4.2  k , which was about 4.2  t for @xmath4 = 25  nm , increasing to 5.2  t for @xmath4 = 50  nm and beyond .",

    "<S> in a sandwich consisting of two superconducting films , one weakly pinning and one strongly pinning , the vortex positions in both films are determined by the strongly pinning material and the vortex lattice is disordered in both films . </S>",
    "<S> we used ( strongly pinning ) nbn and ( weakly pinning ) @xmath0-mo@xmath1ge  and studied , by directly imaging the vortex core positions with a scanning tunnelling microscope , how this disorder is restored with increasing thickness of @xmath0-mo@xmath1ge  layer or when the interface is made insulating . for clean interfaces </S>",
    "<S> we find that the first reordering of the vortex lattice is found at a layer thickness wich is compatible with the first bending mode of the vortex lines . </S>",
    "<S> making the interface insulating we find that order is restored quickly . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that this is can be understood from the competition between the josephson force working on the vortex segments on the one hand , and the elastic restoring forces inside the weakly pinning layer on the other hand . </S>"
