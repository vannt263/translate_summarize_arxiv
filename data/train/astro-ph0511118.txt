    "globular clusters ( gcs ) contain red giants , both first ascent red giant branch ( rgb ) stars and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars .",
    "these red giants have evolved from 0.81 m@xmath0 main - sequence stars , and are believed to lose 1020 per cent of their mass on the rgb and a similar amount on the agb before ending as low - mass white dwarfs .",
    "this mass loss is induced by radial stellar pulsation , and further driven by radiation pressure on dust grains that form in the cool , dense atmosphere .",
    "the gc s intra - cluster medium ( icm ) is thus continuously replenished with neutral material .",
    "the wind outflow velocities are with @xmath110 km s@xmath2 smaller than the escape velocity @xmath32050 km s@xmath2 of a typical gc",
    ". hence of order 100 m@xmath0 of interstellar material must have accumulated within the gc ( tayler & wood 1975 ) before it is removed by ram pressure upon crossing the galactic plane , which typically happens once every @xmath4@xmath5 yr ( odenkirchen et al .  1997 ) .",

    "further evidence for stellar mass loss in gc red giants includes blue - asymmetric absorption line profiles in optical spectra ( bates , kemp & montgomery 1993 ) , h@xmath7 line emission ( cohen 1976 ) which however is complicated by the presence of a chromosphere ( dupree , hartmann & smith 1990 ) , and stellar pulsation and associated levitation of the stellar atmosphere ( frogel , persson & cohen 1981 ; frogel & elias 1988 ) .",

    "on the other hand , the presence of a population of free electrons in 47tuc is inferred from pulsar timing observations ( freire et al .",

    "we have performed a new , sensitive search at arecibo in the 21 cm hi transition and , in parallel , in all four 18 cm oh transitions , to investigate the atomic and molecular content of the icm and to search for circumstellar oh masers within a small selection of galactic gcs .",
    "the arecibo radio telescope was used between 17 and 23 september 2004 with the l - wide receiver to measure the hi line at 1420 mhz , the oh mainlines at 1665 and 1667 mhz and the oh satellite lines at 1612 and 1720 mhz in the direction of a selection of galactic gcs ( table 1 ) .",
    "each of the four boards of the correlator was centered on one of the lines laboratory frequency , with board 3 being centered on 1666.38 mhz in between the two oh main lines .",
    "the correlator was set for 9-level interleave sampling at two orthogonal polarizations , using a bandwidth of 6.25 mhz for the hi and 3.125 mhz for the oh lines .",
    "the four spectra , obtained with 1-sec integration dumps , were sampled with 1024 channels , resulting in a channel width of 1.29 and 0.570.53 km s@xmath2 for the hi and oh16121720 mhz lines , respectively .",
    "the system temperature was typically 2628 k at 1420 mhz , at a gain of @xmath410 k jy@xmath2 .",
    "calibration from correlator counts to the antenna temperature units was performed with respect to the noise diode ( `` hcal '' ) of known strength .",
    "the system was validated at the start of the first night through the observation of the bright circumstellar oh maser emission from the galactic star rx sge .",
    "we followed a standard on / off position switching strategy , pointing alternately at the centre of the target and at a `` blank sky '' position , while tracking exactly the same azimuth and zenith angle range for both on and off scans .",
    "typical integration time per scan was 5 min , followed by an on / off observation of the noise diode for 10 sec .",
    "the total accumulated on - target integration times are listed in table 2 . as an additional experiment , to better sample the emission from intervening matter , we also performed sparse mapping of m15 , m2 and pal13 by obtaining on spectra at 68 positions around the target s centre separated by 3.5 arcmin .",
    "note that the fwhm for the l - wide receiver is 3.4 arcmin at a frequency of 1420 mhz , and 2.9 arcmin at a frequency of 1666 mhz ( heiles et al .",
    "2001 , with updates on http://www.naic.edu/@xmath4phil/sysperf/sysperf.html ) .",
    "the spectra were processed in idl , using standard arecibo routines to calibrate the individual on and off spectra ( http://www.naic.edu/@xmath4phil/ ) .",
    "the combined off spectrum was smoothed by 7 channels ( hi ) or 15 channels ( oh ) , respectively , to provide a reference which is practically noise free but which still contains all of the slow baseline structure .",
    "the baseline - corrected spectra were then derived by taking the difference between the combined on spectrum and this reference .",
    "the targets were selected from the harris ( 1996 : revision 22 june 1999 ) catalogue of 147 galactic gcs , with @xmath18 declination @xmath19 deg and galactic latitude @xmath20 deg .",
    "some of their properties are summarised in table 1 .",
    "both m15 and m2 are massive gcs with large tidal radii , and any icm may therefore be distributed over many arcminutes .",
    "however , most of the stellar mass is well confined within the arecibo beam of @xmath21 , with m15 having experienced core collapse , and any icm must also be centrally concentrated to some degree . the gcs ngc6934 and ngc7006 have large velocities with respect to the galactic disk , minimising the risk of contamination with foreground emission .",
    "m15 is given the highest priority since circumstellar dust ( origlia et al.2002 ) and intra - cluster dust ( evans et al .",
    "2003 ) have been detected in it , as well as the pn ps1 ( alves , bond & livio 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "the high central velocity dispersion of @xmath22 to 15 km s@xmath2 is interpreted by some as evidence for the presence of an intermediate - mass black hole ( gerssen et al .",
    "2002 ) , although recent n - body models do not require such a black hole ( mcnamara , harrison & anderson 2003 ) .",
    "it has been argued that the small gc pal13 is in the process of being tidally disrupted unless it is dark - matter dominated ( siegel et al .",
    "2001 ; ct et al .",

    "show evidence for the velocity dispersion to rise from @xmath25 km s@xmath2 in the cluster core to @xmath26 km s@xmath2 ( i.e.  comparable to the escape velocity ) at a projected distance of @xmath27 from the core .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,<,^,^,>,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      + @xmath28 rms = 1.4 mk in the smoothed @xmath29 spectrum of fig .  1 .      in fig .",
    "1 the hi spectrum in the direction of the core of m15 is displayed , together with a smoothed version obtained with a 6-channel running boxcar .",
    "hi emission is detected at precisely the velocity of m15 .",
    "the emission is resolved from the galactic foreground emission , which only interfers at @xmath30 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the width of the emission is similar to the radial velocity dispersion of m15 , lending further support to the reality of the detection .",
    "the integrated emission corresponds to a neutral hydrogen mass of @xmath31 m@xmath0 , which is significant at a level of more than 5 @xmath32 .",
    "much less integration time was spent in mapping mode than in pointing mode and the sparse map of m15 can not therefore reveal a smilarly weak signal as that shown in fig .  1 .    in figs .  2 & 3",
    "are displayed the hi spectra of m2 and pal13 , together with the `` pointing '' off spectrum and the individual offset pointings in the sparse map .",
    "if the same offset pointing was revisited then the individual spectra were averaged .",
    "the middle panel shows the difference between the on spectrum and the combined off pointings from the sparse map , along with the standard deviation ( @xmath32 ) amongst these off pointings . in the bottom panel",
    "this on@xmath33off spectrum is expressed in terms of @xmath32 to show the significance of excess emission in the core of the gc as compared to the fluctuations in the surrounding emission .    for m2",
    "the sparse mapping may have allowed us to detect hi in its core despite the strong galactic foreground emission : the core has excess emission over surrounding pointings at a velocity of @xmath34 km s@xmath2 ( fig .",
    "2 ) , which is within the 2 km s@xmath2 uncertainty of the velocity of m2 .",
    "the emission reaches a nearly 4 @xmath32 significance over fluctuation in the surrounding emission .",
    "another peak of excess emission at @xmath35 km s@xmath2 does not appear to be significant as the same emission component is seen in the s and nw offset pointings .",
    "given the large tidal radius of m2 it is still possible that this emission is extended and physically associated with the cluster .",
    "the + 3 km s@xmath2 component seems to reside in the core of m2 , and would correspond to a neutral hydrogen mass of @xmath36 m@xmath0 .",
    "the radial velocity of pal13 places it on the wing of strong galactic foreground emission .",
    "however , that emission varies very little across the sparse map , and as a result there is a hint of extremely faint emission at @xmath37 km s@xmath2 at a 2 @xmath32 level and much stronger excess emission at @xmath38 km s@xmath2 ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "although the latter reaches a significance of over 3 @xmath32 with respect to the surrounding emission fluctuations , this component suffers from much greater galactic contamination .",
    "its large velocity difference of @xmath39 km s@xmath2 casts doubt on a physical association with pal13 as it exceeds the escape velocity by almost an order of magnitude .",
    "excess emission is , however , seen at all velocities from @xmath40 up to @xmath440 km s@xmath2 , and the two `` components '' only become separate when expressing their strengths in @xmath32 .",
    "emission from the magellanic stream behind pal13 was detected at @xmath40 km s@xmath2 ( see appendix a ) , and an intermediate - velocity cloud can be seen in the off beam at @xmath41 km s@xmath2 ( fig.3 ) .",
    "no hi was detected in ngc6934 or ngc7006 , despite the very low noise levels and large systemic velocities .",
    "the 5-@xmath32 upper limit to the neutral hydrogen mass in the arecibo beam is @xmath42 m@xmath0 for ngc6934 , somewhat smaller than the upper limit obtained by birkinshaw et al .",
    "for ngc7006 the 5-@xmath32 upper limit is @xmath43 m@xmath0 .",
    "given their small projected sizes it is unlikely that a significant amount of neutral hydrogen mass was missed .",
    "no oh emission was detected from any of the gcs in our sample , neither in the main lines nor in the satellite lines .",
    "dickey & malkan ( 1980 ) observed ngc7006 , m15 and pal13 at 1665 and 1667 mhz at rms levels that correspond to 6.6 , 3.9 and 4.4 mjy for our velocity channel width : our search is 58 times more sensitive ( table 2 ) .",
    "frail & beasley ( 1994 ) obtained upper limits to the 1612 mhz emission at an equivalent rms level of @xmath460 mjy .",
    "our search was more sensitive than this by two orders of magnitude .",
    "the deepest hi survey to date was performed at arecibo by birkinshaw et al .",
    "not only is the new l - wide receiver more sensitive , but also birkinshaw et al .",
    "observed known radio sources at generally more than a beam - width _ away from the gc centre_. they will thus have missed gas residing within the gc core .",
    "pointing directly at the gc centres and performing sparse mapping observations to remove galactic foreground emission greatly improved our chances of detecting the icm .",
    "we detect hi emission in the core of m15 .",
    "the excellent agreement between the peak velocity and velocity dispersion of the hi emission and those of m15 strongly suggest that the neutral hydrogen in m15 is associated with the icm .",
    "it is unlikely to be associated with the pn ps1 in m15 , as the velocity of ps1 differs from that of m15 by @xmath44 km s@xmath2 ( rauch , heber & werner 2002 ) .",
    "the cold dust detected in m15 by evans et al .",
    "( 2003 ) is almost certainly associated with the icm ( rather than being of circumstellar nature ) and the neutral hydrogen may be directly associated with this dust component .",
    "the hi emission detected in at least one ( m15 ) and possibly up to three ( m2 and pal13 ) out of five gcs indicates that the icm typically contains @xmath451 m@xmath0 of neutral hydrogen ( of course , besides any hydrogen there must be at least another 25 per cent in the form of helium ) .",
    "this is roughly equivalent to the total amount of mass lost by a few low - mass agb stars , which happens on a timescale of @xmath46 yr . stripping of the icm during galactic plane crossing occurs on timescales that are two orders of magnitude longer , and massive gcs such as m2 and m15 each contain dozens of agb stars .",
    "one would thus have expected to find more than two orders of magnitude more icm than what we detect here in neutral hydrogen .",
    "this problem becomes even worse if we consider only 5-@xmath32 upper limits to our data , which correspond to @xmath47 m@xmath0 .",
    "freire et al .",
    "( 2001 ) argue that the stellar radiation field in a gc is sufficient to ionize all hydrogen .",
    "they provide evidence for the presence of @xmath48 m@xmath0 in the form of plasma , in 47tuc as well as in m15 . this is less than the mass of neutral hydrogen that we detect , and therefore insufficient to solve the missing icm mystery .",
    "more hydrogen may be hidden in molecular form .",
    "the gas - to - dust mass ratio in the circumstellar envelope of an agb star is @xmath4200 at solar metallicity , and scales approximately linearly with metallicity ( van loon et al .",
    "the detection of @xmath49 m@xmath0 of dust in m15 ( evans et al.2003 ) , in combination with a gas - to - dust mass ratio of @xmath5020,000 for this metal - poor gc , would lead to a predicted @xmath51 m@xmath0 of gas , the majority of which must therefore be in molecular form . such large reservoirs of molecular gas are not supported by observations of co , which yield upper limits on the total gas mass of @xmath160.1 m@xmath0 .",
    "the real gas - to - dust ratio is extremely uncertain , though . on the basis of the detected amount of neutral hydrogen alone , one would estimate @xmath50600 for the icm of m15 .",
    "there are indications for pal13 to be tidally disrupted ( siegel et al.2001 ) , a process which may already have removed gas from its icm .",
    "if the hi emission in our spectrum of pal13 is real then its large velocity spread of @xmath5230 km s@xmath2 compared to its stellar velocity dispersion and escape velocity of only 23 km s@xmath2 might imply that we are witnessing the stripping of the gas from the gc . ngc6934 and ngc7006 are considerably more massive and tidal stripping at their current locations in the galactic halo is expected to be much weaker than for the low - mass gc pal13 .",
    "still , our upper limits to the neutral hydrogen content of these two gcs are with a few m@xmath0 tight enough to require some stripping mechanism in addition to the passage through the galactic plane .",
    "especially ngc7006 is quite distant from the galaxy and is therefore certain to have lived in relative isolation for the past @xmath5 years .",
    "could a wind drive mass loss from the gc at a rate of @xmath5310@xmath54 m@xmath0 yr@xmath2 ?",
    "the wind speed in low - mass agb stars is too low to overcome the gravitational pull of a typical gc .",
    "however , the combined stellar radiation field of the gc might be able to drive a wind for much longer , pushing the gas out to a distance at which the local gravitational acceleration has dropped sufficiently for the gas to become gravitationally unbound . at an outflow velocity of 10 km s@xmath2 the gas would have been dispersed over more than the arecibo beamsize within a few @xmath55 yr for a gc at a distance of 10 kpc .",
    "for this to work , the gas must have sufficient opacity to be driven by radiation pressure .",
    "although atomic and molecular hydrogen are extremely inefficient for this , they may be collisionally coupled with other sources of opacity such as dust grains or ions .",
    "it would have been easier to explain an absence of dust and an abundance of interstellar gas in this way as at low density the dust will be unable to drag the gas with it , but at least in the case of m15 we do find ourselves in that situation .",
    "isolated dwarf irregular ( dirr ) galaxies are more gas - rich than dirrs within 250 kpc of the milky way or m31 , and the gas - less dwarf spheroidal galaxies are almost exclusively found in the vicinity of either the milky way or m31 .",
    "this may be understood if ram pressure in a hot halo is effective in stripping the dirrs of their gas ( blitz & robishaw 2000 ) .",
    "if true , then this could also be a viable mechanism for stripping gcs of their gas as their orbits never take them completely out of the galactic halo ( frank & gisler 1976 ; lea & de young 1976 ) .",
    "the envelopes of mass - losing agb stars provide an ideal environment for oh masers to occur .",
    "the 18 cm transition can be pumped by the infrared radiation arising from the circumstellar dust , and the slow cool wind ensures a long velocity coherence path .",
    "the 1612 mhz line is normally the strongest maser in well - developed outflows , but the 1665 mhz line can dominate at low mass - loss rates when the oh is located closer to the warm stellar photosphere and the 1667 mhz line might be seen in circumstellar envelopes with short velocity coherence paths .",
    "thermal emission is orders of magnitude weaker than the maser emission .",
    "no maser emission was detected in any of the gcs that we looked at .",
    "would we have expected to detect any circumstellar masers ? assuming the same scaling relation of the oh intensity with bolometric luminosity as found for the oh masers detected in the galactic centre and large magellanic cloud ( marshall et al .",
    "2004 ) , and assuming a bolometric magnitude of @xmath56 for a low - mass thermal - pulsing agb star , then the expected intensity of the oh maser in a gc agb star would be @xmath40.1 jy at the distance of m2 or m15 .",
    "that is more than an order of magnitude brighter than our 5-@xmath32 upper limits .",
    "the oh maser mechanism in the metal - poor outflows of low - mass gc agb stars may be less efficient due to the reduced infrared emission in a dust - poor wind .",
    "the oh masers may also be fainter due to a lower abundance of hydroxyl as a result of the lower abundance of oxygen and/or a higher photo - dissociation rate in the stronger and less attenuated stellar radiation field in a gc .",
    "we conducted the deepest survey to date , at hi 21 cm and oh 1612 , 1665 , 1667 and 1720mhz with arecibo , towards five galactic globular clusters .",
    "we present a tentative detection of 0.3 m@xmath0 of neutral hydrogen in the core of m15 .",
    "this is a few orders of magnitude less than what is expected to accumulate via stellar mass loss , and a removal mechanism in addition to galactic plane crossings is still required to explain the paucity of the intra - cluster medium .",
    "no oh maser emission was detected in any of the clusters , at a level which is an order of magnitude below that expected from scaling known oh masers sources to the likely properties of mass - losing agb stars in globular clusters .",
    "the faintness of globular cluster oh masers may be due to the low metallicity and strong interstellar radiation field .",
