    "the relativistic harmonic oscillator ( rho ) model of hadrons was extensively studied and successful to explain magnetic moments of baryons @xcite , hadron spectroscopy and decays @xcite .",
    "an attempt was also made to derive it from the first principle in ref .",
    "it is also used to explain nucleon - nucleon force and study nuclear properties @xcite . as a further extension of the model , here",
    "we apply it to study quark stars .",
    "quark star may be a big hadron made up of many quarks , subjected to confinement .",
    "such a matter may be found deep inside a neutron star or may be a next fate of a neutron star whenever it s mass exceeds the limit such that the degenerate pressure due to neutrons fail to support the gravitational collapse @xcite .",
    "such a compact stars were studied using different confinement models , different equation of state ( eos ) and also models with mixture of hadrons and quarks , called hybrid stars @xcite .",
    "other exotic quark stars , motivation of these studies , and possible candidates for quark stars are reviewed in ref .",
    "it is a hope that the study of quark matter in astrophysics may shed light into perturbative and nonperturbative properties of qcd ( quantum chromodynamics ) .",
    "it is speculated that certain kind of pulsars may be a possible candidates for quark stars @xcite .",
    "our aim here is to study nonrotating , cold , pure quark star confined by rho potential using tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation .",
    "of course , such a study was carried out earlier in ref .",
    "@xcite where the eos , needed in tov equation , was derived by assuming that all quarks are confined to the center of a spherical bag by rho potential . however , we know , from the study of statistical mechanics of particles in harmonic oscillator potential @xcite , that pressure of such a system goes to zero at infinite volume limit . in our model , we derive eos by assuming that quarks are confined at different centers in a finite spherical volume .",
    "it is similar to the well known problem of diamagntism @xcite where electrons are confined at different centers in a plane perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field in a finite volume .",
    "this model gives finite pressure at infinite volume limit , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we also studied an approximate mass - radius relationship of quark stars using newtonian gravitational theory .",
    "it is speculated by many authors @xcite that , before the massive star collapses to black hole when nuclear fuel burns out , it undergoes various stages like white - dwarf , neutron star , hybrid star , quark star or other exotic quark stars .",
    "here we are interested in rho confinement on bulk quark system like quark stars .",
    "it is a simplified model of quark star without rotation and hybrid nature of actual quark star .",
    "it is a system of quarks with overall color neutral , but confined by qcd vacuum , like big hadron .",
    "there are such models with confinement borrowed from bag models of hadron spectroscopy @xcite and studied using both tov and newtonian formulations . in bag model of quark star ,",
    "quarks are free inside the bag , but confined by both bag pressure and gravitational pressure . in our model , quarks are inside a spherical bag , but each quark subjected to a rho potential with confinement centers anywhere within the bag .",
    "this is just the extension of the 2-dimensional confinement of electrons in the problem of diamagnetism to 3-dimension .    from the hadron spectroscopy studies , the single particle energy eigenvalue in rho is @xcite , @xmath0 where @xmath1",
    ", @xmath2 is the rho coupling strength and @xmath3 , the quark mass .",
    "therefore , quarks inside a volume @xmath4 have discrete landau levels instead of continuum levels as in the case of free quark ( @xmath5 ) inside a bag at infinite volume limit .",
    "however , according to landau s prescription @xcite , the continuum energy levels for @xmath5 have become discrete , but degenerate to accommodate all levels of continuum in rho .",
    "this phase - space degeneracy may be written as , @xmath6 \\,\\,,\\ ] ] a straight forward extension of degeneracy in the problem of diamagnetism @xcite . now following the standard procedure of evaluation of degenerate pressure",

    "since each level is degenerate , to take account of partially filled level , expression for energy may be modified as , @xmath11 \\sqrt{(2 n+1 ) c_q^2 + m_q^2 } + ( n -n_0 ) \\sqrt{(2 n_f+3 ) c_q^2 + m_q^2}\\,\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the total number of quarks including the partially filled level .",
    "the degenerate pressure is @xmath13 . this degenerate pressure balances the gravitational inward pressure according to the tov equation , @xmath14 \\left [ 1 + \\frac{4 \\pi \\bar{r}^3 \\bar{p}}{\\bar{m}}\\right ] \\left [ 1 - \\frac{2 \\bar{m}}{\\bar{r}}\\right]^{-1 } \\,\\",

    "all variables above are normalized as , @xmath18 as usual , tov equations are solved , numerically , starting from initial value @xmath10 , which corresponds to some central density , and the radius for which pressure goes to zero is obtained .",

    "( [ eq : tovp ] , [ eq : tovm ] ) , is numerically solved for both the models with different central densities .",
    "we have considered quark star with two flavors and hence @xmath34 .",
    "the mass of the star increases with the central density and reaches a maximum value and decreases as shown in fig .",
    "1 . there is a clear difference between the two models .",
    "the maximum mass and corresponding radius are tabulated in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "we have taken @xmath35 , which is in the range of values used in hadron spectroscopy , and obtained the maximum mass for different quark masses , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the proton mass .",

    "for massless quarks , quark star mass as well as radius scales as @xmath41 or @xmath42 , the confinement strengths . therefore , larger the confinement strength smaller the mass and the radius . from the mass - radius plot ,",
    ", we see that the stable quark stars in rho model always have larger mass and radius compared to the bag model . from tables 1 and 2 , the central energy densities required for stable stars are lower in rho model . for stable stars , mass increases with central energy density , and hence have lower central energy density than that of maximum mass star .",
