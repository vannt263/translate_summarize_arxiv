    "this has recently led to a revival of interest in graphene on transition metal surfaces  @xcite , as large area epitaxial graphene layers of exceptional quality can be grown , which might be an alternative to micromechanical cleavage for producing macroscopic graphene films .",
    "the first mass - production of high quality graphene layers via chemical - vapour deposition ( cvd ) method on polycrystalline ni surface and its transferring to arbitrary substrate was demonstrated in the beginning of 2009  @xcite .",
    "the transferred graphene films showed very low sheet resistance of 280@xmath11 per square , with 80% optical transparency , high electron mobility of 3700@xmath12v@xmath13s@xmath13 , and the half - integer quantum hall effect at low temperatures indicating that the quality of graphene grown by cvd is as high as mechanically cleaved graphene .",

    "if the fermi surface projections of ferromagnetic metals , @xmath15 ni or co , on the ( 111 ) close - packed plane are considered , then in both cases graphene has only minority electron density around the @xmath14 points of the surface brillouin zone . in this case",

    ", graphene might be the best material for the realization of spintronic devices .",

    "similar results were obtained for graphene / co(0001 )  @xcite .",
    "this interaction manifests itself by a considerable modification of the graphene- and ni - related valence band states as a result of the hybridization of the graphene @xmath0 and the ni @xmath1 states accompanied by a partial charge transfer of spin - polarized electrons from ferromagnetic substrate to graphene .",
    "these calculations also predict that several occupied and unoccupied interface states ( @xmath60 ) are formed in this system which lead to noticeable modifications of the carbon @xmath14-edge electron energy loss spectroscopy ( eels ) spectrum .",
    "the detailed description of the electronic structure of the graphene / ni(111 ) system including the interface states will be given in the next section in conjunction with the discussion of the angle - resolved photoemission results .    in the following",
    "we would like to compare our xas results with the recently calculated c @xmath14-edge eels spectra for the graphene / ni(111 ) interface  @xcite . in this case ,",
    "experimental xas spectra taken at @xmath61 and @xmath62 correspond to the calculated eels spectra for the scattering vector @xmath63 perpendicular and parallel to the graphene layer , respectively .",
    "the calculated eels spectra are found to agree well with the experimental xas data [ see fig .",
    "6(b ) ] : ( i ) the spectra show the same angle ( scattering vector ) dependence and ( ii ) the experimentally observed xas features are well reproduced in the calculated eels spectra .",
    "for example , two peaks in the xas spectra in the @xmath55 spectral region at 285.5ev and 287.1ev of photon energy can be assigned to the double - peak structure in the calculated eels spectrum at 0.8ev and 3.0ev above the fermi level  @xcite . according to the theoretical calculations  @xcite ,",
    "the first sharp feature in the xas spectrum is due to the transition of the electron from the @xmath50 core level into the interface state @xmath64 above the fermi level ( around the @xmath14 point in the hexagonal brillouin zone ) which originates from the c@xmath8ni@xmath1 hybridization and corresponds to the antibonding orbital between a carbon atom c-@xmath43 and an interface ni atom .",

    "the experimental data collected at the ni @xmath32 absorption edge in the pey mode ( more surface / interface sensitive ) also shows a slight reduction of the spin moment to @xmath76 .",
    "however , the observed decreasing is not so pronounced as yielded by the theoretical calculation , which can be explained by the large contribution of the bulk - derived signal to the xmcd spectra",
    ".    the most important and interesting results of these xmcd experiments on the graphene / ni(111 ) system is the observation of the relatively large dichroic contrast at the c @xmath14 absorption edge [ fig.7(b ) ] . in order to magnify the measured magnetic contrast at the @xmath55 absorption edge ,",
    "these xmcd spectra were collected in the pey mode with the circularly polarized light at an angle of @xmath77 .",
    "we note that the observed differences in the xas spectra collected at this angle visible in figs.6 and 7 are due to the different polarization of light : in fig.6(a ) the data are obtained with the linearly polarized x - rays , i.e. the strong angular dependence of the absorption signal is due to the different graphene s orbital orientation ; whereas the data in fig.7 are taken with the circularly polarized light , i.e. both @xmath55 and @xmath56 transitions are nearly equivalently possible .",
    "the c @xmath14 xmcd spectrum reveals that the major magnetic response stems from transitions of the @xmath50 electron onto the @xmath2-states , while transitions onto the @xmath51-states yield very weak ( if any ) magnetic signal .",
    "these results indicate that only the c @xmath78 orbitals of the graphene layer are magnetically polarized due to the hybridization with the ni @xmath1 band .",
    "the sharp structure at the @xmath55 absorption edge originates from hybridized c@xmath8ni@xmath1 and c@xmath8ni@xmath79 states ( see earlier discussion and ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the appearance of xmcd signal at the c @xmath14-edge shows that indeed the ni film induces a magnetic moment in the graphene overlayer .",
    "however , at the c @xmath14 absorption edge , the electron transitions occur from the non - spin - orbit split @xmath50 initial states to the @xmath80 final states and thus , in the analysis of the dichroism effect at the @xmath14 edge one equation in the selection rules is missed .",
    "this means that the xmcd signal at @xmath14 edges provides the information only on the orbital magnetic moment @xmath81  @xcite .",
    "the partial charge transfer from ni to c atoms in the graphene / ni(111 ) system was calculated for the 22-atom(graphene)/ni cluster  @xcite yielding 0.205@xmath82 per c atom in graphene which leads to the @xmath80-orbital occupation number of @xmath83 .",
    "using the the c @xmath14 xas spectra the procedure described in work  @xcite , the orbital magnetic moment of @xmath84 per c atom was extracted .",
    "the relatively large uncertainty arises mainly from the estimation of the number of c @xmath80 holes , the background subtraction of xas spectra , and from the error for the degree of circular polarization of light .",
    "the theoretical work  @xcite also gives the values for the spin magnetic moment of @xmath85 and @xmath86 for c-@xmath43 and c-@xmath15 atoms , respectively .",
