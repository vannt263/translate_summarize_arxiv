    "the concept of a field - effect transistor with a micromachined cantilever as floating gate was put forward and discussed a long time ago by nathanson _ et al _",
    "@xcite ( see , also ref .",
    "recently  @xcite , this concept was father evolved and a floating - gate high - electron - mobility transistor ( hemt ) device comprising a microcantilever over a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) channel was fabricated and measured ( see , for instance , also refs .",
    "a theoretical assessment of this and similar devices is usually based on equations governing the mechanical motion of the cantilever supplemented by some circuit equations . however , the motion of the electrically actuated microcantilever results in a complex motion of electrons in the 2deg channel , which , in turn , leads to variations of the electron sheet density and the self - consistent electric field affecting the microcantilever dynamics .",
    "the simplest effect of 2deg in micromachined hemts is associated with a finite conductivity of the latter , particularly at the voltages corresponding to a significant depletion of the 2deg channel .",
    "the electron transient processes associated with the variations of the electron sheet density and the self - consistent electric field , i.e. , electron plasma processes , can play a significant role in hemts and different hemt - based devices  @xcite ( see also experimental papers  @xcite ) .",
    "the plasma effects in the hemt - like devices can result in resonant response at the frequencies coinciding with the frequencies of plasma oscillations .",
    "since these frequencies usually fall into the terahertz range , such effects are important in different terahertz devices . despite a substantial difference in the resonant mechanical frequencies and the characteristic plasma frequencies ,",
    "micromachined elements such as a microcantilever floating - gate may be useful for terahertz devices .",
    "for instance , the microcantilever floating gate can be used for the internal modulation of terahertz signals in the resonant detectors utilizing the excitation of plasma oscillations ( see , for example , ref .   [ 8 ] ) .",
    "the consideration of plasma effects in the hemt - like devices requires a device model which adequately describes spatio - temporal variations of the 2deg system .    in this work",
    ", we develop a model which self - consistently describes the mechanical oscillations of a highly conducting ( metallized ) microcantilever and the dynamic properties of the 2deg system . the model is based on an equation governing oscillations of a microcantilever under mechanical and electric forces and hydrodynamic equations governing the electron transport in 2deg .",
    "our model accounts for such phenomena as the depletion and enrichment of 2deg by the applied voltage in the presence of the surface charges at the semiconductor surface beneath the microcantilever and finiteness of the 2deg conductivity , the delay in the electron recharging under the microcantilever ( gate ) and the spatial nonuniformity of the potential distribution in the 2deg , which might affect the device characteristics .",
    "thus , the model under consideration is a distributed ( physical ) model which provides more general and detailed description of the underlying processes than that based on the treatment of the electron system of the device invoking electric circuit models .",
    "generally , the device under consideration is similar to those fabricated and studied both theoretically and experimentally , in particular , in refs .",
    "the main distinction is that in micromachined hemts investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite there are two metallized sufraces : one at the bottom of the microcantilever and one covering a portion of the semiconductor surface under the microcantilever ( the so - called input force plate  @xcite ) . in contrast",
    ", we assume that the microcantilever motion is due to the interaction of the charge induced in the microcantilever metallized surface and the charge in the 2deg channel .",
    "thus , the 2deg channel plays the dual role : it is used for the microcantilever actuation and the variation of its conductivity is used to detect the output signals .",
    "the effectiveness of the control of the 2deg channel by applying voltage to the microcantilever was demonstrated experimentally even in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see , also ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . the effect of interaction of the charges induced in the microcantilever and the conducting plane electrode was theoretically considered recently in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , the model used in ref .",
    "@xcite assumes , in contrast to our model , that the electrode is ideally conducting that is not always the case in real 2deg channels .",
    "the developed model is used to study the resonant response of the device to the ac signals .",
    "we find the dependences of the resonance frequency and the resonance width on the both mechanical and electron properties of the system under consideration .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate that the plasma effects in the 2deg channel can give rise to a shift of the resonance and an increase in the oscillation damping , i.e. , limit the quality factor of the microcantilever oscillations .",
    "we show also that relatively high - frequency signals ( with the frequency corresponding to the plasma resonance ) can result in a significant variation of the microcantilever position .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  2",
    ", we discuss the device model and write down the pertinent equations .",
    "section  3 deals with a small - signal analysis based on the linearized versions of equations of the model . in this section",
    ", we calculate the spatial distributions of the ac potential and electron density in the 2deg channel and find the amplitude ( response function ) of the microcantilever oscillations as a function of the signal frequency and the bias voltage . in sec .  4",
    ", we analyze the response function in different limiting cases and demonstrate the results of numerical calculations of the device characteristics using the formulas obtained in the previous sections . section  5 deals with the calculations of the output source - to - drain ac current and the effective device transconductance . in sec .  6",
    ", we consider the effect of high - frequency signals ( on the variation of the microcantilever position associated with the plasma resonance . in conclusion",

    "it is assumed that the voltage applied between the metallized cantilever , which serves as the hemt floating gate , and the side contacts to 2deg channel ( hemt s source and drain ) comprises the dc ( @xmath0 ) and ac ( @xmath1 ) components .",
    "focusing on fairly detailed description of the electron transport in the 2deg channel accompanying the microcantilever oscillations , we shall consider the cantilever mechanical properties in the framework of a simplified model , namely , using the so - called point - mass model  @xcite ( see fig.2 ) .",

    "equation  ( 1 ) is valid in the case of a highly conducting ( metallized ) cantilever when its surface is equipotential .",
    "the microcantilever and 2deg are separated by two layers : the isolation solid layer of thickness @xmath22 and dielectric constant @xmath23 and the layer of a gas ( or vacuum ) of thickness @xmath24 and dielectric constant @xmath25 ( see figs .  1 and 2 ) . the term in the right - hand side of eq .",

    "the model is based on an equation of mechanical motion of the microcantilever in the point - mass approximation accompanied by hydrodynamic equations describing distributed electron plasma phenomena in the 2deg channel . using this model , we calculated the response function describing the amplitude microcantilever oscillations and the output electric signal as functions of the signal frequency and the bias voltage for the devices with different parameters .",
    "we found the voltage dependences of the frequency of the mechanical resonance and its damping .",
    "it was demonstrated that the amplitudes of the mechanical oscillations and output electric signal exhibit pronounced maxima at the voltages close to the voltage of the 2deg channel depletion . however , further increase in the bias voltage results in a drastic drop of the mechanical and electrical response .",
    "we showed also that at the frequency corresponding to the plasma resonance the ac electric field between the microcantilever and the 2deg channel can be rather strong .",
    "this can result in a significant variation of the microcantilever position by incoming high - frequency ( terahertz ) signals .",
