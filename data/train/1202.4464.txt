    "furthermore , stellar population studies of local elliptical galaxies clearly find that the stars in the most massive elliptical galaxies were formed earliest ( @xmath13 ) and fastest ( @xmath14  gyr ) , while lower - mass systems have more extended formation histories and later formation times ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the tension between the tight scaling relations of elliptical galaxies and their apparent puffing up from late - time merging is alleviated if the stars added at late times are deposited at large radius .",

    "* ) , these observations have not extended much beyond the effective radius . to fully exploit the fossil record to understand the assembly of elliptical galaxies , we ought to look for radial changes in the stellar population , particularly beyond @xmath15 .",
    "the study of the radial dependence of chemical composition in elliptical galaxies has a long history .",
    "imaging studies of elliptical galaxy colors date back to @xcite .",

    "the summary presented in @xcite remains accurate today ; elliptical galaxies are bluer at large radii , most likely due to a decline in metallicity @xcite .",
    "however , with photometry alone it is difficult to precisely disentangle the well - known degeneracies between age and metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "metallicity dominates the color changes , decreasing outwards by 0.1 - 0.5 dex per decade in radius .",
    "in general there is no strong evidence for age gradients ( although see baes et al . for an alternate view ) .",
    "-0 mm    spectroscopic surveys can track more than just metallicity and age .",
    "they can also study the relative abundances of individual elements .",
    "in particular , the @xmath10  elements ( e.g. , mg , c , o , n ) are formed in type ii supernova explosions , while the fe - peak elements ( fe , cr , mn ) are formed predominantly in type ia supernovae , and are thus produced with a temporal lag from the peak of star formation .",

    "integral - field unit ( ifu ) spectroscopy provides two - dimensional information , and coadding the signal in annuli strongly boosts the signal relative to the sky .",
    "a handful of studies thus far have used ifus with smaller fields of view , and either tile the instrument at large radius ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or focus on the central regions of the galaxy @xcite . in this work ,",

    "we summarize and conclude in  7 .",
    "when needed , we use the standard concordance cosmology of @xcite .",
    "we start with a small pilot sample of eight galaxies as a proof of concept that the mitchell spectrograph is well - suited to this work ( table 1 , figure [ fig : spec_pg1 ] ) .",
    "the sample selection is not ideal , and we do not make claims of its completeness or uniformity , since the galaxies were selected with other science goals in mind . in short",

    "each of the 246 fibers subtends @xmath17 and are assembled in an array similar to densepak @xcite with a 107@xmath27107  field of view and a one - third filling factor .",
    "the mitchell spectrograph has performed a very successful search for ly@xmath10 emitters @xcite and has become a highly productive tool to study spatially resolved kinematics and stellar populations in nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "we used the low - resolution blue setting of the mitchell spectrograph .",
    "our wavelength range spans 3550 - 5850  with an average spectral resolution of @xmath28  fwhm .",
    "this resolution delivers a dispersion of @xmath8  @xmath29  pixel@xmath5 and corresponds to @xmath3  @xmath30  km  s@xmath5  at @xmath31 , our bluest lick index .",
    "each galaxy was observed for a total of @xmath12 hours with one - third of the time spent at each of three dither positions to fill the field of view .",
    "initial data reduction was accomplished using the custom code vaccine @xcite .",
    "we briefly review the steps of the pipeline here , but refer the interested reader to the previous papers for more detailed discussion .",
    "initial overscan and bias subtraction are performed first on all science and calibration frames .",
    "all co - additions of data and calibration frames are performed with the biweight estimator ( beers et al . 1990 ) .",
    "twilight flats are used to construct a trace for each fiber , which takes into account curvature in the spatial direction .",
    "we employ a routine similar to that proposed by @xcite to avoid interpolation during this step .",
    "thanks to this special care , correlated errors are avoided and it is possible to track the s / n in each pixel through the remainder of the reductions . knowing the s / n in each pixel enables deeper limits in detection experiments such as those performed by @xcite .",
    "all subsequent operations are conducted in the new trace coordinate system within a cross - dispersion aperture of 5 pixels .    to correct for curvature in the spectral direction ,",
    "a wavelength solution is derived for each fiber based on arcs taken both at the start and end of the night .",
    "gaussian fits to known arc lines are fit with a fourth - order polynomial to derive a complete wavelength solution for each fiber .",
    "the typical rms residual variations about this best - fit fourth - order polynomial are @xmath32  for the sept 2010 data and @xmath33  for our june 2011 data .",
    "a heliocentric correction is then calculated for each science frame .",
    "-0 mm    next , a flat field is constructed from the twilight flats taken at both the start and end of the night .",
    "variations in temperature never exceeded 2  c for any of our observing nights and the stability of the flat field has been shown to be @xmath34 pixels under these conditions @xcite . as the twilight flats contain solar spectrum , we generate a model of this component by employing a bspline fitting routine @xcite .",
    "a boxcar of 51 fibers is employed to model the solar spectrum that effectively removes all cosmic rays , continuum sources , and variations in the flat field , in order to isolate the solar spectrum .",
    "the spatial and spectral curvature are leveraged here in order to supersample the solar spectra within the boxcar .",
    "this supersampled bspline fit to the solar spectra within each fiber is then divided into the original flat .",
    "what remains are the flat field effects that we want to capture : variations in the individual pixel response , in the relative fiber - to - fiber variation , and in the cross - dispersion profile shape for every fiber .",
    "this flat field is then applied to all of the science frames .",
    "the next step is sky subtraction . unlike some instruments ( e.g. , sauron ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the mitchell spectrograph does not have dedicated sky fibers .",
    "instead , we observed off - galaxy sky frames with a sky - object - object - sky pattern , with five minute exposure times on sky and twenty minute object exposures .",
    "the sky nods are processed in the same manner as the science frames described above . in order to create a sky frame",
    "we give an equal weighting of two to each sky nod , then coadd them to achieve an equivalent exposure time as the science frames .",
    "the advantage of sky nods is the high s / n we achieve in our sky estimate , based on the large number of fibers in the ifu .",
    "the disadvantage is that we sample the sky at a different time than the science frames and are thus subject to temporal variations in the night sky , particularly at twilight .",
    "however , by varying the weights given to each sky nod we are able to explore possible systematics due to sky variability .",
    "for all lines measured , no ew value changes by more than @xmath32  due to temporal sky changes , even at the largest radii considered in this paper . we give the details and return to possible systematics related to sky subtraction in  4.2.1 . once the sky subtraction is complete , cosmic rays are identified and masked .",
    "we use software developed for the venga project @xcite for flux calibration and final processing .",
    "we observe flux calibration stars each night using a six - point dither pattern and derive a relative flux calibration in the standard way .",
    "then we use tools developed by m.  song , et al .",
    "( in preparation ) to derive an absolute flux calibration relative to the sdss imaging .",
    "m. song uses synthetic photometry on each fiber and scales it to match the sdss @xmath35band image of each field , with a median final correction of @xmath36 .",
    "the correction exceeds @xmath37 only during a period of high cirrus in the second night of observing in sept 2010 , which affects nvss j0320 + 4136 and ngc 426 .",
    "finally , all fibers are interpolated onto the same wavelength scale and combined .",
    "we focus on spectra combined in elliptical annuli with a width of 0.5@xmath15 .",
    "since the effective radii of these galaxies are @xmath8 twice the fiber diameter of 4 , 0.5@xmath15 is roughly the scale of a single fiber . in all cases we use the de vaucouleurs radius derived by the sdss pipeline .",
    "since we are averaging over such large physical areas on the sky , the exact measured @xmath15 should not impact the conclusions .",
    "we did experiment with using wider radial bins at large radius to extend further from the galaxy center .",
    "however , we did not boost the s / n appreciably in this way .",
    "furthermore , we begin to be systematics limited at @xmath38 (  4.2.1 ) .",
    "the bins consist of 1 - 4 fibers at @xmath39 , increasing to 20 - 40 fibers at @xmath40 .",
    "the s / n per final coadded spectrum is shown in table 2 .",
    "since all of our galaxies by selection have sdss spectra , we can test the wavelength dependence of the flux calibration by comparing the shape of the spectrum in the central fiber of the mitchell spectrograph with the sdss spectrum .",
    "we find @xmath41 agreement in nearly all cases , with no more than @xmath42 differences at worst .",
    "our ultimate goal is to derive the stellar population properties of the galaxies using the absorption line spectra . in principle , we can use full spectral synthesis techniques ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and exploit all the information available in the spectra .",
    "however , in practice , there are a number of hurdles , including imperfect flux calibration and systematic color effects , that make the model fitting sensitive in systematic ways to imperfections in our data .",
    "it is known that the models are not always able to fit the absorption line equivalent widths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although see also @xcite .",
    "since we are most interested in measuring changes in stellar population properties as a function of radius , we use line index measurements ( e.g. , lick indices , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as most prior work on this subject has used similar methodology , we are in a good position to compare with the literature .",
    "keep in mind that we are thus measuring the luminosity - weighted mean properties of the stellar population .",
    "another major uncertainty in these stellar population synthesis models comes from our relative ignorance of stellar spectral energy distributions for stars with very different metallicities and/or abundance ratio patterns than stars in our solar neighborhood .",
    "these modeling deficiencies impact our study directly , since elliptical galaxies tend to have higher metallicities and @xmath10-abundance ratios than local stars . lately , the problem has garnered substantial attention both from the point of view of full spectra synthesis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and for lick index inversion methods @xcite .",
    "we exploit these modern models , but note that our knowledge of the underlying stellar evolution remains imperfect .",
    "something like @xmath43 of elliptical galaxies contain low levels of ionized gas within an effective radius @xcite . for our purposes",
    ", this emission serves only as a contaminant , as it fills in the absorption features that we are trying to measure . by far",
    "the strongest emission feature in our spectra is the [ ] @xmath44 line , but there are no absorption features of interest that are confused by [ ] .",
    "it is contamination from h@xmath45  and [ ] @xmath46 that concerns us here . in order to correct for this low - level emission ,",
    "we adapt the code ppxf+gandalf developed by m. sarzi @xcite and m. cappellari @xcite .",
    "ppxf performs a weighted fit to the galaxy continuum using spectral templates provided by the user , including a polynomial fit to the continuum and a gaussian broadening to represent the intrinsic dispersion of the galaxy . from these fits",
    "we derive a measurement of the stellar velocity dispersion in each radial bin .",
    "gandalf iteratively measures the emission and continuum features simultaneously , to achieve an unbiased measurement of both components . as templates ,",
    "we use @xcite single - age stellar population models with @xmath47  km  s@xmath5resolution . in principle",
    ", we could use these fits to trace the stellar populations with radius , but for the reasons discussed above , we do not find this methodology robust .    in general ,",
    "the emission - line ew is small compared to that of the absorption lines .",
    "the maximum contamination comes in the central fiber of ngc 7509 ( which has high - ionization lines indicative of an accreting black hole at the center ) .",
    "however , note that our spectral resolution of @xmath48  km  s@xmath5  is not necessarily high enough to resolve the emission lines .",
    "we compare the fit to [ ]  from the central pixel of the mitchell spectra with the sdss line fits at twice the resolution .",
    "the two fits agree within @xmath49 ( range of @xmath50 differences ) . as a result of the weakness of the features and the low spectral resolution",
    ", we do not have strong constraints on the flux or line shape of these emission lines .",
    "we incorporate emission line subtraction into our error bar estimates as described below .",
    "while the emission - line gas is not the focus of this paper , we note that in a few cases the [ ]  emission is observed to extend beyond @xmath51 .",
    "an analysis of this emission will be the focus of a different work .",
    "unfortunately , even very small corrections do lead to substantive changes in the inferred galaxy ages ",
    "@xmath52  of h@xmath45  emission infill corresponds to an age difference of @xmath53 gyr @xcite .",
    "thus , we caution that the absolute ages derived here are uncertain at this level . in some cases , in fact , the small infill of the h@xmath45  lines by emission leads to h@xmath45  ews that are smaller than even the oldest and most metal - rich single stellar population ( ssp ) models . @xcite",
    "describes a detailed method to detect [ ] at the @xmath54  level .",
    "as described below , we do not have the s / n to perform their analysis , but the level of infill will become relevant again when we derive stellar populations in  4.3.1 .",
    "measuring absorption - line indices and placing them on a common system is a delicate art that is sensitive not only to the spectral resolution of the instrument , but also flux calibration and s / n ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we utilize the flexible and robust idl code _",
    "lick_ew _ , written by g. graves @xcite .",
    "the code takes as input the stellar velocity dispersion at each radial bin and puts the measured ews on the lick system . in principle",
    "we measure ews for all 26 lick indices , but we focus our attention on h@xmath45 , mg@xmath6 , fe 5270 , and fe 5335 ( table 2 ) .",
    "we also measure the ca h+k index as defined by @xcite . because of its high ew , any change in ca h+k ew are indicative of systematic effects in the spectra ( see  4.2.1 ) .",
    "since we compare with lick indices defined on flux - calibrated stars @xcite , we only correct the indices to a standard spectral resolution but apply no other zeropoint offsets . this same approach is taken by @xcite . by comparing the mitchell indices from the central spectrum with the indices measured from the sdss spectra",
    ", we confirm that we are on the same system ( figure [ fig : cflick ] ) .",
    "note that the apertures are not perfectly matched ( 3  vs 42 ) but the difference between these two should be small since the observed gradients are gentle .",
    "spectra and lick indices for all galaxies are presented in figure [ fig : spec_pg1 ] and table 2 .",

    "we have explored various causes for the systematic offset , including non - gaussian line - broadening functions , variations in resolution with wavelength , and sky subtraction .",
    "none alone is sufficient to explain this systematic effect , although likely a combination of these , and possibly small - scale errors in flux - calibration , are to blame . as described above , our h@xmath45  measurements are likely suffering from very low levels of emission - line infill , which makes it difficult to derive absolute ages .",
    "thus , we do not focus on the absolute values of the derived parameters here , but rather on our main strength , which is gradients out to large radii .",
    "-0 mm      potential contributors to our error budget include random noise , emission line removal , and sky subtraction .",
    "we can build the former two into monte carlo simulations of our measurement process .",
    "for each galaxy , in each radial bin , we start with the best - fit model from gandalf and create 100 realizations , using the error spectrum generated by vaccine .",
    "we rerun gandalf and _ lick_ew _ on each artificial spectrum and take the error bar as defined by the values encompassing 68% of the mock measurements .",
    "note that the model contains both emission and absorption lines , and thus we should include the uncertainties due to emission line removal naturally in our error budget .",
    "sky subtraction is a potentially significant source of uncertainty since we are working factors of a few below the level of the sky . in order to quantify",
    "how much sky variability effects our final science results we take a heuristic approach .",
    "we explore two different scenarios .",
    "the first quantifies how changes in the night sky between our two sky nods impacts our final measured ew values .",
    "the second test quantifies the effect of an overall over- or under - subtraction of the night sky .",
    "in both cases we allow the weighting given to each sky nod to vary , then carry through all the resulting variations in the subtracted science frames .",
    "a comparison of the final measured ew values allows for a very direct measure of how well we are handling sky subtraction .",
    "we give the details of both scenarios here .",
    "to quantify how changes in the night sky between our two sky nods influence our final measured ew values we explore a range of weighting in the sky nods used for subtraction .",
    "for example , if the sky did not vary over the @xmath68 minutes between our two sky nods , an equal weighting of 2.0 given to each sky nod would be appropriate .",
    "this equates to an equal amount of total exposure time for each sky nod ( e.g. , 5 min @xmath69 + 5 min @xmath69 = 20 min ) .",
    "however , the sky may evolve on timescales shorter than this . to quantify the effect of an evolving sky on our final science results we ran several different sets of sky nod weightings through our reduction routines and",
    "compared the final ew values for all indices .",
    "we average deviations over radial bins from @xmath70 .",

    "the @xmath72ew for each line for the case above were as follows : mgb = @xmath76 ; h@xmath45 = @xmath77 ; fe  5270 = @xmath78 . from an analysis of the variability of the sky spectra over several nights ( figure 15 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the case of 20% variability is extreme .",
    "the one exception occurred with ic  1152 , which saw a rising moon for some of the exposures . in this case",
    "we explored a wide range of sky weights and found a weighting of 2.4  -  1.6 to be optimal .",
    "the second scenario we explore is aimed at understanding what systematic effect over- or under - subtraction of the sky has on our ew values . to test this we conducted a similar set of tests , yet allowed the final weighting of 4.0 to vary .",
    "we ran tests exploring both a 5% and 10% over and under subtraction , relative to equal exposure time .",

    "secondly , we do see hints of a mg@xmath6-@xmath3  correlation even at large radii , but with much more scatter .",
    "there is also an intriguing hint that the slope of the mg@xmath6-@xmath3  relation changes .",
    "unfortunately , the correlation is driven to a large degree by the galaxy ngc 1270 , which has the largest @xmath3  value in our sample .",
    "ngc 1270 also happens to be our only cluster galaxy .",
    "since the distribution of merger mass ratios is nearly independent of mass @xcite , we might expect the mass of the typical accreted system to rise with mass , thus preserving an mg@xmath6-@xmath3  relation at large radius .",

    "the next obvious question is whether the mg@xmath6  ew drops primarily because of changes in [ fe / h ]  or [ @xmath10/fe ] .",

    "we make a testable prediction of strong evolution in the metallicity and [ @xmath10/fe ] ratios of @xmath131 elliptical galaxies from @xmath11 to the present .    in our analysis",
    ", we have assumed a constant initial mass function . if instead massive elliptical galaxies have either a top - heavy @xcite or a bottom - heavy @xcite initial mass function compared to lower - mass systems , that may change the interpretation of the gradients .",
    "we have also ignored the possible variation between different @xmath10  elements , particularly nitrogen @xcite .",
    "we have used the mitchell spectrograph to gather high s / n spectra of eight massive early - type galaxies out to @xmath9 , in order to study the chemistry of their stellar halos .",
    "looking first at the trends in lick indices with radius , we find that the ew of mg@xmath6  drops , such that the well - known mg@xmath6-@xmath3  relation is not preserved at large radii . instead the mg@xmath6  ews at large radii are similar to those found in the centers of galaxies that are an order of magnitude less massive .    we show that the well - known metallicity gradients seen within @xmath15 continue to the furthest radii probed here .",
    "in contrast , [ @xmath10/fe ] does not drop substantially in any object , and certainly never approaches the solar value .",
    "thus , the stars in the outer regions of these elliptical galaxies are metal - poor and @xmath10-enhanced , much like the stars in the milky way halo .",
    "we suggest that the outer parts of these galaxies are built up via minor merging with a ratio of @xmath114 , but that the accreted galaxies did not have sufficient time to lower their @xmath10-abundance ratios to those seen in @xmath122 elliptical galaxies today .",
    "this paper is only a proof of concept ; the mitchell spectrograph is ideally suited to study the faint outer parts of galaxies , and there is a considerable amount of follow - up work to be done .",
    "first of all , we would like to investigate the kinematics in the outer parts of these galaxies to determine whether there are correlations between angular momentum content and metallicity .",
    "we are working on gathering a larger sample , with a full sampling of velocity dispersion , size , and environment , to see whether the radial gradients in ( e.g. , ) metallicity , correlate with the size of the galaxy at fixed @xmath3 , or the large - scale environmental density .",
    "it seems clear that galaxy evolution is accelerated in rich environments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , leaving subtle imprints in the central stellar populations of galaxies @xcite .",
    "whether that will leave clear signatures in the gradients remains unknown . even in our own small sample",
    "there are real differences from galaxy to galaxy , and it will be very interesting to see whether the large - scale environment is the cause .",
