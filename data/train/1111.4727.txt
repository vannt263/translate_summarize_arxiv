    "this classical question is answered in a variety of contexts and for various classes of representations , for example when @xmath0 is type i and @xmath2 is irreducible @xcite , or when @xmath2 is the left regular representation of @xmath0 @xcite .",

    "on the other hand an explicit plancherel formula for @xmath0 is given in @xcite using coadjoint orbit parameters .",
