    "localized and patterned ( labirynth ) structures in bistable media are widely considered with relevance to the storage of binary information @xcite . far enough from the phase - transition point , the complexes of dws are observed in chemical reactors , magnetic and polar ( solid and liquid ) media while their basic properties are described with equations of motion with are similar for different media . in particular , far from the critical regime , the magnetization ( polarization ) dynamics is described with the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation while near the criticality it is governed by the ginbzurg - landau ( gl ) equation .",
    "recently , one observes an especial interest in 1d complexes of magnetic and polar dws due to hopes for miniaturization of memory carriers which result from achievements of current nanowire technology @xcite .",
    "the problem of stability of many - domain complexes is connected to the need of switching the domain - encoded binary information on demand since such process induces unbalanced interactions of the dws .    in the present work ,",

    "it enables me to consider the stability of many - domain structures . with correspondence to 2d magnetic bubbles ( which are called hard ones when their boundary is composed of alternating bloch and neel lines ) , i divide the 1d bubbles into hard ones ( composed of one bloch and one neel - ising dws ) and soft ones ( composed of two bloch dws or two neel - ising dws ) @xcite . in my recent papers on the externally - driven motion of dws ,",
    "i have studied the formation of 1d hard bubbles via collision of a bloch dw with a neel ( ising ) dw in the normal and critical regimes , ( solving the llg and gl equations , respectively ) @xcite . here , the energy of soft bubbles is studied as function of the bubble length within a perturbation calcus in order to complete the picture of the dw interactions .",

    "is described by a strict solution to the llg equation , hence , there is no interaction between the walls .",
    "an interaction appears , however , upon the field application due to a dynamically induced deformation of the dws .",
    "the external field enforces motion of any dw and its anti - wall in the opposite directions and it can induce the collision of a neel dw with a bloch dws .",
    "the result of such a collision has been found to be their mutual reflection accompanied by the transformation of the bloch wall into the neel dw and vice versa .",
    "the process can be considered as the transmission of the bloch dw through the neel dw with change of the head - to - head structure into the tail - to - tail one ( and vice versa ) which is illustrated in fig . 2 , and it is similar to the collision of spontaneously propagating ( in absence of dissipation ) dws @xcite .",

    "the bloch dws of opposite chiralities attract each other when the distance of their separation is big and they repel each other at short separation distances . because of the minims of the energy @xmath88 at @xmath57 , stable bubble of bloch dws ( a breather ) can be formed even in absence of the field .",
    "the bloch dws of like chiralities always repel in absence of the field , hence , an external field antiparallel to the magnetization of the intermediate domain enables creation of a stable bubble ( a breather ) which corresponds to the minims of @xmath89 .",
    "stability of many - dw structures is an important problem in view of the challenge of designing a nanowire - based information carrier ( a dw - racetrack memory ) @xcite .",
    "periodic structures of the bloch ( neel ) dws are stationary because of the compensation of ( attractive or repulsive ) interactions between the walls .",
    "however , bit recording requires switching the magnetization of a single domain of the memory tape on demand .",
    "for instance , the magnetization reversal can be performed via flip of the chirality of two neighboring dws in the tape , which initiates their movement towards or outwards each other and , eventually , results in their annihilation due to the appearance of uncompensated attractive forces .",
    "unfortunately , the resulting nonperiodicity of the system causes destabilization of the record .",
    "i mention that similar process is responsible for annihilation of dws during strong - current driven motion of multi - domain systems @xcite .",
    "then , the unbalanced interactions appear because , for the current intensity exceeding the walker - breakdown value , magnetization in different ( head - to - head and tail - to - tail ) dws rotates in opposite directions about the magnetic axis , ( unlike upon the application of a strong magnetic field ) .",
    "an exception is a subcritical system of bloch dws whose all the neighboring dws are of opposite chiralities and the distance of their separation corresponds to the size of the breather found in section iii .",
    "the result of changing the chirality of a single dw or a dw pair is some shift of the wall positions without any flip of the domains .",
    "aperiodic trains of dws of like chiralities ( unstable to dw interactions ) as well as trains of alternating bloch and neel ( ising ) dws ( unstable to the neel - bloch or ising - bloch transition inside the dws , @xcite ) can be stabilized by an external magnetic field whose application results in creation of soft and hard magnetization bubbles , respectively .",
    "the energy of a soft bubble increases with the field value [ see minims of @xmath90 , dotted lines in fig . 1 and fig .",
    "3 ] , hence , unlike for weak fields , in a regime of strong field , the hard bubbles can be energetically favorable @xcite .",
