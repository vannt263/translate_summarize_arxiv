    "while the low - temperature phase exhibits confinement and breaking of chiral symmetry , at high temperatures the behavior of the theory is qualitatively different  the interaction between quarks and gluons decreases due to asymptotic freedom , leading to deconfinement , and the chiral symmetry is restored ( see @xcite for a recent review ) . in the crossover region",
