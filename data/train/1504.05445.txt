    "the brownian continuum random tree ( bcrt ) , which was introduced and first studied by aldous  @xcite , is the prototypical example of a random @xmath0-tree / continuum random tree .",
    "its importance derives from the fact that it is the scaling limit of a large class of discrete trees including : all critical galton ",
    "watson trees with finite offspring variance  @xcite , unordered binary trees  @xcite , uniform unordered trees  @xcite , uniform unlabelled unrooted trees @xcite , critical multitype galton ",
    "watson trees  @xcite and random trees with a prescribed degree sequence satisfying certain conditions  @xcite .",
    "it is also the scaling limit of random dissections  @xcite and random graphs from subcritical classes  @xcite .",
    "many of these convergence results are proved using some sort of functional coding . however , particularly in the case of unordered trees , a natural functional coding whose distributional properties are easily understood is not always available . in such settings ,",
    "an alternative approach is desirable .    by a _ recursive distributional equation _ for a random variable @xmath1 taking values in some polish space @xmath2 , we mean an equation of the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 are i.i.d .",
    "copies of @xmath1 , independent of the family of random variables @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is a suitable @xmath2-valued function . we can , of course , think of this equation in terms of probability distributions : if @xmath7 is the distribution of @xmath1 and @xmath8 is the distribution of the right - hand side then @xmath7 is a fixed point of the operator @xmath9 .    for families of random variables which satisfy a natural recursive distributional equation , the so - called _ contraction method _ has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool for proving convergence results .",
    "suppose that @xmath10 is a sequence of distributions for which we wish to prove that there exists a limit @xmath11 .",
    "the basic idea is as follows .",
    "suppose that @xmath12 can be described recursively in terms of @xmath13 for @xmath14 .",
    "this equation often allows one to guess a limiting version , in which @xmath11 is described in terms of itself . in other words",
    ", @xmath11 should be the fixed point of some operator @xmath15 .",
    "suppose that , in addition , @xmath15 is a contraction in a suitable metric on the space of probability measures .",
    "then banach s fixed point theorem tells us that there exists a fixed point and that @xmath16 as @xmath17 in the sense of that metric .",
    "this is straightforward in principle , but usually the recursive equation for @xmath12 does not have precisely the same form as the limiting operator .",
    "moreover , finding a metric in which @xmath15 is a contraction ( but which also yields weak convergence ) is often highly non - trivial . in practice , this method has been applied very successfully for sequences of random variables ( see , for example , @xcite ) , but so far there is only one result for the more complicated setting of convergence of stochastic processes @xcite .",
    "it is often the case that families of discrete trees have a recursive definition or description .",
    "aldous  @xcite proved that the bcrt is a fixed point for a natural operation on continuum trees . with these two facts in mind ,",
    "it is natural to ask if a contraction method can be established for random trees .",
    "this seems an ambitious aim , and there are several technical issues to be overcome ( not least the choice of metric ) .",
    "but our original motivation stems from the fact that , if such a principle were to be established , then the characterization of possible limits should be the first step . in this article",
    ", we prove that the bcrt is the unique fixed point of an appropriate operator , and that this fixed point is attractive for a certain natural class of measures on continuum trees .",
    "the rest of this note is organised as follows . in section 1",
    ", we provide an overview of the various definitions of the bcrt which already exist in the literature .",
    "this also enables us to introduce various concepts we will need in the sequel .",
    "we then set up our fixed point equation .",
    "in section 2 , we prove that it has a unique solution . in section 3 , we show that repeatedly applying the fixed point operator to any suitable law on continuum trees gives convergence to the law of the bcrt in the sense of the gromov  prokhorov topology .",
    "section 4 contains some concluding remarks .",

    "again , in this case , the tree - shape is deterministic . we will show that the lengths of the three branches can each be expressed as sums of rescaled distances between pairs of uniform points .",

    "however , if at least two points fall into the same subtree , say @xmath164 , we must then further decompose @xmath164 in order to try to determine the location of the branch - point .",

    "now observe that the probability that the points are separated depends only on the _ sizes _ of the subtrees and not on the underlying structure of the trees .",
    "in particular , this means that we can use the infinite version of our coupling .",
    "so let @xmath290 be the smallest value @xmath291 such that the branch - point between our three uniform points is a gluing point at level @xmath292 in the infinite coupling .",

    "the three points fall in different subtrees .",

    "two points fall in the same subtree and the remaining point falls in a different subtree .    in case ( 1 ) , as observed above , the branch - point is necessarily @xmath289 . in case ( 2 ) , we have a new independent copy of the original problem of finding the branch - point between three points chosen uniformly from a copy of @xmath37 . in case",
    "( 3 ) , the branch - point we seek is the same as that between @xmath289 and the two uniform points which fell in the same subtree . but @xmath289 is also a uniformly chosen point in that subtree .",

    "consider @xmath91 points picked uniformly in @xmath37 and @xmath194 , where we couple the choice of these points in such a way that they fall in subtrees with same label in @xmath37 and @xmath194 ( this is completely analogous to the way we couple the branch - points with the random variables @xmath322 in the previous section ) . on the event @xmath323 ,",

    "the result follows since @xmath326 was arbitrary and @xmath327 .    in view of theorem",

    "prokhorov distance is then equivalent to the convergence @xmath340 for each @xmath87 ( see greven , pfaffelhuber and winter  @xcite , or the introduction to bertoin and miermont  @xcite ) .",
    "we will again use the coupling of subsection  [ sub : coupling ] to prove this .",
    "indeed , for fixed @xmath294 , we must look to recursion depth @xmath293 in order to separate our @xmath91 uniform points . for fixed @xmath148 , by proposition  [ prop : geom ]",
    ", we can find @xmath292 sufficiently large that @xmath341 .",
    "we work on the event @xmath342 .",
    "then , for @xmath343 , in order to obtain coupled trees distributed as @xmath128 and @xmath12 respectively , we need to `` plug in '' @xmath344 input trees at level @xmath292 in the coupling , sampled according to @xmath128 and @xmath345 , respectively .",
    "moreover , as in the proof of proposition  [ prop : redtree ] , the lengths of the edges of the reduced trees can then be viewed as sums of scaled distances between uniform points in these trees with distributions @xmath128 and @xmath345 .",
    "so we need to control the distribution @xmath346 of the distance between two uniform points in a tree distributed as @xmath345 .",
    "note that @xmath347 , the @xmath348-fold iterate of the smoothing transform @xmath186 applied to the law @xmath349 of the distance between two uniformly sampled points of @xmath350 .",
    "theorem 2(b ) of durrett and liggett  @xcite gives conditions under which repeated applications of the smoothing transform yields convergence to a fixed point .",
    "recall the function @xmath351 from the proof of proposition  [ prop : distance ] .",
    "then the conditions of durrett and liggett s theorem are that ( a ) @xmath351 has its unique zero in @xmath176 at @xmath352 ( b ) that @xmath353 and ( c ) that the law to which we repeatedly apply @xmath186 should have the same mean as the fixed point .",
    "we already checked ( a ) and ( b ) in the course of the proof of proposition  [ prop : distance ] .",
    "moreover , by assumption , @xmath354 } } = \\sqrt{\\pi/2 } = \\int_0^{\\infty } x \\hat{{\\mathbbm{m}}}(\\mathrm d x)$ ] , so that ( c ) also holds .",
    "we conclude that , for fixed @xmath292 , we have @xmath355 as @xmath17 .",
    "the edge - lengths in @xmath337 can then be written as sums of randomly rescaled independent random variables sampled from @xmath346 .",
    "it is then clear ( since we use the same random scaling factors in order to construct both ) that the edge - lengths of @xmath337 converge in distribution to those of @xmath88 on the event @xmath342 for any fixed @xmath291 .",
    "since @xmath148 was arbitrary , the result follows .",
    "as mentioned in subsection  [ sub : bcrtfix ] , aldous  @xcite shows that , in a sense , we can `` reverse '' the operator @xmath15 .",
    "indeed , we can decompose a bcrt by picking three uniform points and splitting at the branch - point between them ; we obtain three independent bcrt s , brownian - rescaled by @xmath357 . each of these subtrees is doubly marked , one mark being the original uniform point and the other being the former branch - point .",
    "perhaps a more natural way of phrasing the reversal , which yields only a single mark in each subtree , would be to pick each of the branch - points in the tree with probability given by 6 times the product of the masses of the subtrees into which removal of that branch - point splits the tree .",
    "if we _ do _ use three uniforms to pick the branch - point then the two marks in each subtree are independent uniform picks from that subtree .",
    "this decomposition operation is used recursively by croydon and hambly  @xcite to prove that the bcrt is homeomorphic to a certain deterministic fractal with a random self - similar metric , along with the naturally - associated measure . in the course of their proof ,",
    "they show ( lemma  10(d ) of @xcite ) that all of the randomness in the bcrt is contained in an i.i.d .",
    "family of @xmath358 scaling factors @xmath359 .",
    "although we have referred to this decomposition of the bcrt as the reverse of our operator @xmath15 , there is , in fact , a rather subtle difference which arises concerning marking and labelling .",
    "the forward version of croydon and hambly s splitting operator acts on _ doubly uniformly marked trees _ and can be paraphrased as follows : take three independent bcrt s , @xmath360 , each with two independent uniform points , labelled 1 and 2 .",
    "rescale these trees according to the appropriate dirichlet random vector and glue them together at the points labelled 1 .",
    "now relabel the point labelled 2 in @xmath164 by 1 , keep the point labelled 2 in @xmath165 and forget the point labelled 2 in @xmath166 as well as the branch - point just created .",
    "then this is again a doubly uniformly marked bcrt .",
    "this seems to us a much less natural `` forward '' operation on continuum trees than the one pursued in this paper , but it has the advantage that the recursive decomposition obtained by going backwards does not have any of the labelling issues encountered in section  [ sub : coupling ] .",
    "indeed , in this version there is no randomness in which subtree attaches to which other subtree .",
    "the distributional convergence in theorem  [ th : cvg ] is in the sense of the gromov ",
    "prokhorov distance which , for example , does not distinguish between the bcrt and the bcrt decorated by the independent ppp discussed after theorem  [ th : fxpt ] .",
    "in particular , this convergence is equivalent to the convergence in distribution of the random finite dimensional distributions . it would be interesting to find conditions under which the convergence holds instead in the stronger gromov  hausdorff  prokhorov sense ;",
    "in particular , we would need a certain tightness condition to hold ( see corollary 19 of @xcite ) .",
