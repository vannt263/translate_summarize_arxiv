    "over the last few years lepton flavour violation ( lfv ) has become a hot topic . on the one hand ,",
    "neutrino oscillations have been discovered recently , which is already a clear signal for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . incorporating these effects into a minimal extension of the sm , lfv for the charged leptons",
    "is predicted , but however at a completely unobservable level . on the other hand , many models forcast measurable new physics ( np ) effects at the tev scale , which can be investigated soon with the upcoming experiments .",
    "these extensions of the sm predict lfv at much higher rates , which , in some cases , may already be in conflict with existing experimental bounds @xcite ( see also @xcite for a recent summary of @xmath3-factory results ) . with the advent of new experimental facilities @xcite ( see also @xcite ) the current bounds will be pushed further , if not a discovery will be made .    to identify effects beyond the sm one needs , among others , reliable bounds on lfv decay modes .",
    "this requires knowledge on the phase space dependence .",
    "furthermore if a discovery is made , one can directly compare different np models .",
    "but due to the huge number of different models , this is quite cumbersome . on the other hand",
    "a model - independent approach allows us to classify the effects in a general way .",
    "this results can then in principle be used to compare or restrict different models .",
    "all this models which predict lfv @xmath0 decays of the form @xmath4 with @xmath5 @xcite will eventually match onto a set of local four - fermion operators or radiative operators , the latter mediating @xmath6 with subsequent decay of the ( virtual ) photon into a charged lepton pair .",
    "we persue a bottom - up approach , where we regard the sm as an effective - field - theory ( eft ) .",
    "the np effects are expanded in terms of @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the scale corresponding to the np scenario .",
    "this allows us to consider all possible four - fermion and radiative operators with arbitrary coupling constants , which can be determined by studying the decay distributions of the three leptons in the final state .",
    "np models are then distinguished by using the fact that in different models different operators dominate . even if no signal events are found ,",
    "such a study of the decay distributions is necessary to determine the efficiency of an experiment and hence to extract reliable limits .    at the lhc experiments it will be possible to detect lfv decays of a @xmath0 lepton , especially into channels with three leptons .",
    "the signal @xmath9 will be one of the cleanest signatures @xcite ; we will therefore concentrate on this in the following .",
    "first we classify the general set of effective operators and formulate the corresponding interaction theory . after pointing out the kinematical variables",
    ", we show the results for the decay distributions . in the end",
    "we shortly comment on the unknown couplings in minimal flavour violating scenarios and present a conclusion .",
    "we construct the eft by assuming that some contribution from unknown physics beyond the sm at a high scale @xmath8 induces lfv processes .. ] at the electro - weak scale these lfv interactions manifest themselves in higher dimensional operators , which have to be compatible with the @xmath10 gauge symmetry of the sm .",
    "the leading operators for processes involving charged leptons will be of dimension 6 .. the suppression in 2hdm could be reduced due to large @xmath11 effects .",
    "] we will construct these operators in the following .    to respect the sm gauge symmetry we group the left - handed leptons in a @xmath12 doublet , while the right - handed charged leptons ( which are singlets under @xmath12 ) are put into an incomplete doublet , as a reminiscent of a right - handed @xmath13 related to custodial symmetry .",
    "writing also the higgs boson in matrix form , we have @xmath14 for simplicity we have suppressed the family indices , which will be specified once we consider a particular decay mode . in terms of the fields defined in ( [ fields ] ) , the list of operators relevant for the lepton flavour violating @xmath15 decays reads    @xmath16      & \\textbf{dimension 6 radiative : } \\nonumber \\\\      & r_1 =   g ' ( \\bar{l } h   \\sigma_{\\mu \\nu }   r ) b^{\\mu \\nu }   \\label{r1}\\\\      & r_2 =   g ( \\bar{l }   \\tau^a h \\sigma_{\\mu \\nu }    r ) w^{\\mu \\nu , a } \\label{r2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 is the @xmath18 gauge field , @xmath19 are the @xmath12 gauge fields and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the corresponding gauge couplings . in this analysis",
    "we concentrate only on operators which contribute at tree - level ; operators which are bi - linear in the lepton fields and contribute at the loop - level , can be found e.g.  in @xcite .",
    "the most general effective hamiltonian at the electro - weak scale is then obtained by summing over these operators , multiplied by arbitrary coefficients for every flavour combination . in a particular new physics scenario , these coefficients should be obtained by matching at the new physics scale @xmath8 and evolving down to the scale @xmath22 within the sm which is considered as an effective theory ( et ) .    to describe lfv decays of a @xmath0 lepton into three charged leptons , we have to construct the effective interaction at the scale of the @xmath0 lepton . to this end",
    "we integrate out the weak gauge bosons and the higgs . in the following",
    "we will focus on @xmath23 decays ; the decay distributions for @xmath24 decays are identical . on the level of four - fermion operators with dimension 6",
    ", we obtain the same structures as in ( [ o1]-[o4 ] ) . projecting on charged leptons only , we see that @xmath25 becomes equivalent to @xmath26 , and both match onto a purely left - handed operator @xmath27 where here and in what follows the superscript of the coupling denotes the combinations of chiralities involved and the subscript denotes the relevant dirac structure .",
    "likewise , the operator @xmath28 corresponds to a purely right - handed interaction @xmath29 while we get a mixed term from the operator @xmath30 @xmath31    in case of the dimension 6 radiative operators we are only interested in the neutral current component coupling to a charged lepton pair , which mediates the lfv decay into three charged leptons .",
    "switching to the physical fields accounting for the neutral current component , the photon and @xmath32 fields , we have to integrate out both the higgs and the @xmath32 . in doing",
    "so we obtain a radiative operator with a photon , as well as a four - fermion contribution from @xmath32 exchange .",
    "we find that this operator related to @xmath32 exchange is suppressed relative to the photon exchange and four - fermion operators by the small yukawa coupling of the @xmath0 lepton .",
    "thus , only the photonic contribution has to be taken into account . for this",
    "we obtain at the scale @xmath33 @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote the two possible chirality combinations .",
    "vertex could be parametrized as @xmath37          + & m_\\tau \\ , f_\\text{rad}^{(s , h)}(q^2 ) \\ , \\left(\\gamma_\\nu - \\frac{q_\\nu}{q^2 } \\ , \\slash q \\right )      \\big\\",

    "the matrix element for @xmath40 becomes @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the momentum transfer through the photon .",
    "this momentum transfer is proportional to the lepton masses , and thus this contribution scales as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a yukawa coupling of the leptons , which would lead to an enhancement unless an additional yukawa coupling appears in the numerator as , for instance , in minimal flavour violation ( mfv ) .",
    "four different dirac structures can occure if only the four - lepton operators contribute .",
    "two additional dirac structures are possible for decays of the form @xmath45 , where also the radiative operator has to be taken into account .",
    "the corresponding coupling constants @xmath46 of the four - lepton operators and additionally @xmath47 from the radiative operators are matrices in lepton flavour space .",

    "moreover , only ( [ decay1 ] , [ decay2 ] , [ decay5 ] , [ decay6 ] ) receive contributions from the radiative operators via @xmath51 therefore we calculate the dalitz distributions @xmath52 .",
    "we neglect interference terms with different helicities , because of the suppression due to small lepton masses , and take into account only the leading interference term .",

    "we are only considering the minimal insertion .",
    "for one right - handed field we need an insertion of @xmath68 , which produces a suppression of @xmath69 .",
    "the four - lepton operators @xmath70 need at least two insertions of @xmath71 .",

    "the octett @xmath76 describes flavour transitions from 2-lepton as well as from 4-lepton operators .",
    "the 27plet combination @xmath77 accounts only for the 4-lepton operators .",
    "the dominating flavour coefficents for the relevant operators mediating lfv @xmath0 decays in mfv are given by    [ coeffs ] @xmath78    therefore , assuming a mfv scenario , we can relate the couplings to the lepton masses and neutrino parameters via the relations .",
    "lfv @xmath0 decays provides an important test of new physics contributions against the standard model , since many new physics models allow for a huge enhancement of this decay channels .",
    "therefore a great potential to falsify the sm in the upcoming experiments is given .",
    "we have discussed lfv @xmath79 processes in a model independent way . for our analysis",
    "we regard the sm as an effective theory and classify different operators within this effective theory .",
    "the operators differ in their chirality and dirac structure .",
    "we have calculated the dalitz distributions for these different operators including the leading interference term .",
    "it turns out that four - lepton operators show a rather uniform behaviour , whereas the decay distributions of radiative operators show large enhancement in the corners of the phase space .",
    "therefore this analysis allows to distinguish different models with already only a few number of events , because different models give rather different predictions for the relative size of radiative and four - fermion operators .",
    "this clearly shows that using dalitz plots for such processes is a complementary tool to the sole analysis of the total decay rates .",
    "additionaly the knowledge on the phase space distributions allows to improve the bounds on this decay modes by taking into account the different structures .",
