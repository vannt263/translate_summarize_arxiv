    "the mkn is a strangeness - conserving system and should be formed by embedding a @xmath2 meson in the nucleus through strong processes .",
    "both the kaon - condensed state in neutron - star matter and the mkn formed in experiments are cold , dense objects originating from the common @xmath6 and @xmath7 interactions in dense matter , so that they may be closely related with each other .",

    "it has been shown that the lowest @xmath2 energy , @xmath8 , increases as the number of embedded @xmath2 mesons , @xmath9 , becomes large and that it enters into the subthreshold resonance region of the @xmath0(1405 ) ( @xmath1 ) , where @xmath10 = 467 mev .",
    "this is because the contribution to the energy from the repulsive @xmath7 interaction becomes sizable with the increase in @xmath9 as compared with the attractive @xmath6 interaction . in this paper , we take into account the @xmath1-pole contribution as well as range terms and study these effects on the structure of the mkn .",
    "a spherical symmetry is assumed for the mkn , and the mass number @xmath11 , the number of protons @xmath12 , and the number @xmath9 of embedded @xmath2 mesons with the lowest energy @xmath8 are kept fixed .",
    "we start with the effective chiral lagrangian , which incorporates @xmath13-wave interactions between the ( nonlinear ) @xmath14 mesons and nucleons of the scalar type simulated by the @xmath15 sigma term , @xmath16 , and of the vector type ( tomozawa - weinberg term ) . the nonlinear @xmath2 field @xmath17 is given as @xmath18 $ ] , where @xmath19 is the su(3 ) generator and @xmath20 (= 93 mev ) the meson decay constant .",

    "these terms are absorbed into the effective nucleon masses .",

    "the central densities of the protons and @xmath2 mesons become larger . on the other hand ,",
