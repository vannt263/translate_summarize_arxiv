    "heat transport in nanoscale structures has become an active and rapidly growing research area .",
    "progress in experimental methods has enabled the study of fundamental issues , and lately the field has seen major breakthroughs , such as the measurement of quantized heat transport , @xcite and manipulation of thermal currents using external control fields .",
    "@xcite in solid - state systems electron  electron and electron  phonon scattering are the most important channels for small systems to exchange energy with the environment .",
    "however , recently it was understood that at low temperatures one needs to take into account the radiative channel which becomes the dominant relaxation method in mesoscopic samples below the phonon  photon crossover .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we study rectification effects in thermal transport mediated by electromagnetic fluctuations in solid - state nanostructures . in a two - terminal geometry",
    "a finite rectification means that heat current is not simply reversed when the thermal gradient changes sign , but also the absolute magnitude of the current changes .",
    "we define the rectification @xmath0 as @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the magnitudes of the heat currents in forward and reverse bias configurations , respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "previously rectification has been shown to take place in systems where a classical @xcite or quantized @xcite nonlinear chain is coupled asymmetrically to linear reservoirs , when nonlinear reservoirs are coupled through a harmonic oscillator , @xcite or in hybrid quantum junctions.@xcite here we demonstrate rectification in a fully quantum - mechanical and experimentally realizable model where photon - mediated heat current flows between two linear reservoirs coupled asymmetrically to a nonlinear resonator .    ) to a cold reservoir ( temperature @xmath4 ) . to obtain the rectification @xmath0 one must measure the current for both thermal bias directions . in our model",
    "the heat is transported by inductive magnetic coupling between the reservoirs and the central nonlinear resonator . ]",
    "our analysis is based on a nonequilibrium green s function method developed in ref .  , and the nonlinear transport problem is solved with a self - consistent hartree approximation .",
    "rectification is studied as a function of the operating temperatures , reservoir coupling strengths and admittances , and the strength of the nonlinearity .",
    "we also propose a concrete setup based on a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) where the rectification effects can be realized with current experimental technology at sub - kelvin temperatures .",
    "a similar circuit , operated in the linear regime , was employed in the pioneering experiment demonstrating photonic heat transport .",
    "@xcite by adjusting the external magnetic flux through the circuit it is possible to tune the rectification continuously between zero and the maximum value",
    ". using realistic parameters we find a rectification of over 10% , and identify a regime where @xmath0 changes sign as a function of temperature . experimentally rectification has been observed in phonon transport through a nanotube@xcite at room temperature with @xmath5 and in electron transport through a quantum dot@xcite at 80  mk with @xmath0 up to 10% .",
    "the thermal transport setup is depicted in fig .",
    "it consists of two linear reservoir circuits with admittances @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "temperatures of the left and right reservoirs are @xmath8 and @xmath9 in the forward bias setting , and vice versa for reverse bias .",
    "we assume that heat can flow between the reservoirs only through a mediating nonlinear resonator circuit .",
    "the couplings between the reservoirs and the resonator are taken to be inductive with mutual inductances @xmath10 and @xmath11 . using the caldeira ",
    "leggett mapping between linear admittances and bosonic reservoir modes the total hamiltonian takes the form @xmath12 , where the middle circuit and reservoir terms are @xmath13 @xmath14 and the inductive coupling term is @xmath15 which involves the current operators for the central device @xmath16 and for the reservoirs @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "the electric current operator for the central device can be expressed as @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the linear inductance and capacitance of the resonator ; @xmath23 , @xmath24 and reservoir operators are bosonic creation and annihilation operators , @xmath25=1 $ ] .",
    "the nonlinearity of the central circuit is characterized by the the second term in eq .",
    "( [ nonlin ] ) , corresponding to a quartic potential whose strength is controlled by the parameter @xmath26 .",
    "it must be emphasized that eq .",
    "( [ coupl ] ) has a generic bilinear form and therefore our results are relevant for other types of systems beyond the studied realization .",
    "the basis of our analysis is provided by the meir  wingreen formula for the heat current @xcite @xmath27\\mathrm{re}[y_{l}(\\omega)]n_l(\\omega)\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & \\left.{}-2s_i(-\\omega)\\mathrm{re}[y_{l}(\\omega)]\\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath28 is the bose function of the left reservoir and @xmath29 is the current noise power of the central circuit .",
    "the admittances @xmath30 are related to the current correlation functions of the free reservoirs .",
    "@xcite in the absence of the nonlinear term @xmath31 the transport problem can be solved exactly for arbitrary couplings and reservoir admittances . @xcite",
    "no rectification takes place in this regime . in the following",
    "we solve the nonlinear transport problem in a self - consistent hartree approximation , which is expected to be accurate for small values of the nonlinearity .",
    "this approach does not fully account for the correlation effects due to the interplay of nonlinearity and tunneling which are potentially important in the ultra - low temperature regime @xmath32 .",
    "however , analogously to interacting electron transport problems , the mean - field approach is accurate in the sequential tunneling regime when the temperatures are of the order of @xmath33 .    as a first step we approximate the resonator hamiltonian as @xmath34 where we have used @xmath35 with the mean field @xmath36 . here",
    "the factor 6 is the number ways two operators can be picked from a set of four . by performing a diagrammatic expansion of the resonator green s function one can show that this procedure is identical to the self - consistent hartree approximation . because eq .  ( [ int1 ] ) is now quadratic in bosonic operators , it is possible to bring it to diagonal form by a canonical transformation .",
    "however , now we have the added complication of an a priori unknown mean field , which has to be evaluated self - consistently in a nonequilibrium state . the transformed hamiltonian and current operators are @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "thus the effect of the nonlinear term is incorporated by a mean - field dependent renormalization of the resonance frequency of the oscillator and its current operator . for further development",
    "it is convenient to introduce the correlation functions @xmath40\\rangle$ ] and @xmath41 . a nonequilibrium equation - of - motion analysis @xcite , similar to the one presented in ref .",
    ", reveals that the current correlators are given by @xmath42 is the retarded green s function of the uncoupled oscillator .",

    "furthermore , the mean field @xmath44 is related to the lesser correlator via @xmath45 equations ( [ iir])([phi ] ) form a closed set of equations which needs to be solved to find the current correlation functions .",
    "the self - consistent solution proceeds by making an initial guess for the mean field , calculating the correlation function @xmath46 corresponding to the initial value and calculating the updated value of the mean field by evaluating the integral in eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) .",
    "the procedure is repeated until convergence is achieved .",
    "the current noise then follows immediately from the lesser function @xmath47 which yields the heat current after evaluating eq .",
    "( [ current4 ] ) . in the case of a vanishing nonlinearity @xmath31",
    "this procedure recovers the exact solution of the linear problem . to facilitate the analysis of the rectifying mechanism we note that with the help of eqs .",
    "( [ iir])([phi ] ) we can write eq .",
    "( [ current4 ] ) in the form @xmath48{\\rm re}[y_r ] ( n_l - n_r ) } { \\big|f(\\omega)+i\\omega[m_l^2y_l+m_r^2y_r]\\big|^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 .",
    "the frequency dependence of @xmath30 and @xmath50 has been suppressed for brevity . for numerical calculations explicit expressions for the admittances",
    "@xmath30 are needed . here",
    "we assume that the reservoir circuits effectively consist of a resistor , a capacitor , and an inductor in series , resulting in @xmath51^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 are the resistance , quality factor and resonance frequency of the left and right reservoir , respectively .",
    "the behavior of the system is now uniquely determined by nine dimensionless parameters : @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath53 , and @xmath58 .",
    "rectification can then be calculated from eq .",
    "( [ recti ] ) , by computing the forward and reverse bias currents , @xmath59 , with the above prescription .",
    "let us illustrate some generic features of the model with the simple setup of two purely dissipative reservoirs , @xmath60 , in which case the frequencies @xmath61 and @xmath62 are irrelevant . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we plot the rectification against three different variables .",
    "first , from fig .  [ fig2](a )",
    "we see that already at quite small values of nonlinearity , @xmath63 , the rectification has essentially reached its maximum .",
    "such values for @xmath26 are well within the regime of validity of our approximations and should also be easily achieved in the experimental setup proposed below .",
    "next , fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) exemplifies a very generic feature : having @xmath64 tends to produce @xmath65 , and vice versa . finally fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) shows that the rectification increases logarithmically with the temperature ratio @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , to see an appreciable effect , the temperature difference @xmath67 should be of the same order of magnitude as the temperatures themselves .    , as a function of ( a ) nonlinearity @xmath26 , ( b ) coupling @xmath10 , and ( c ) temperature ratio @xmath66 . in all panels we have @xmath68 ,",
    "@xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 , except for the variable on the horizontal axis . in panel",
    "( c ) @xmath8 is varied . ]    for purely resistive reservoirs maximal value for the rectification is about 2% ( fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ) .",
    "larger values can be obtained by adding a reactive part to one of the reservoir circuits . then , as fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows , @xmath0 can be made an order of magnitude higher .",
    "the inset shows the current @xmath2 , normalized with respect to the universal single - channel maximum heat current @xmath73 .",
    "@xcite according to fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the highest values for @xmath0 are obtained for high temperatures , where @xmath2 tends to zero .",
    "high rectification and large current are thus competing effects , and the optimal operating point depends on the experimental constraints . in any case , it is possible to obtain a rectification of @xmath74 with @xmath75 and up to @xmath76 with @xmath77 .    ) . here",
    "@xmath78 and the different curves correspond to @xmath79 ( solid ) , 0.1 ( dashed ) , 0.05 ( dash - dotted ) , 0.02 ( dotted ) .",
    "other parameters as in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . ]    from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we also see that decreasing @xmath61 increases rectification , so both small @xmath61 and the condition @xmath80 favor the direction @xmath65 .",
    "we can also combine these two trends in an opposing manner by making @xmath61 large .",
    "this way one can produce a system where the _ direction _ of rectification changes as a function of temperature . from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we see that in a system with a high - frequency reservoir ( here @xmath81 ) , @xmath82 is positive when both temperatures are below @xmath33 , but at higher temperatures the same device produces a negative @xmath82 .",
    "in contrast to previous reports@xcite on the rectification sign reversal , in our system only the reservoir temperatures need to be changed , not the device parameters .",
    "( solid ) , 0.3 ( dashed ) , 1 ( dash - dotted ) , 3 ( dotted ) , and the higher temperature is varied . the left reservoir is reactive with @xmath83 and @xmath84 , and other parameters are as in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . ]    the direction of rectification can be understood as follows .",
    "equations ( [ iiless ] ) and ( [ phi ] ) show that the mean field @xmath44 is proportional to the self - energy @xmath85 . due to the self - consistency loop",
    "the relationship between @xmath44 and @xmath85 is not actually linear , but in practice making @xmath85 larger will also increase @xmath44 .",
    "next , eq .  ( [ sigmaless ] ) shows that @xmath85 is essentially the product of bose function @xmath50 and the effective coupling strength @xmath86 $ ] , summed over the two reservoirs .",
    "because of this form , it follows that when comparing the forward and reverse bias settings , larger @xmath85 is obtained in the case when the more strongly coupled reservoir is hotter . as a consequence ,",
    "the mean field @xmath44 is also larger when the more strongly coupled reservoir is hotter .    to interpret physically the @xmath44-dependence of the current @xmath87 ,",
    "we analyze separately the numerator and denominator of the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ curr5 ] ) .",
    "the numerator is the product of the energy @xmath88 , bose window @xmath89 , and effective reservoir coupling strengths , as defined above .",
    "thus it can be seen as a measure of the energy available for transport at the reservoirs . on the other hand , the denominator is due to the green s function @xmath90 , giving the transmittance of the central circuit .",
    "equation ( [ curr5 ] ) shows that an increasing @xmath44 effectively increases the central circuit resonance frequency , thereby shifting the resonator transmission window to higher energies . because of the bose functions , in most situations the numerator is smaller at higher energies and the total current decreases .",
    "but this is not always the case .",
    "it turns out that if at least one of the reservoirs is reactive with high resonance frequency ( @xmath91 ) and the reservoir temperatures are high ( @xmath92 ) , the peak of the numerator is shifted to high enough energies so that an increasing @xmath44 produces on increasing @xmath87 . in summary , except for the case of high - temperature and high - frequency reservoirs , larger current is obtained in the configuration where the more weakly coupled reservoir is hotter .",
    "this explains the sign of @xmath82 in all our results .",
    "for low operating temperatures , with @xmath8 , @xmath4 approximately in the range 100  mk1  k , the studied model can be realized by the setup shown in fig .",
    "the system consists of a superconducting loop containing a josephson junction characterized by its josephson energy @xmath93 and shunt capacitance @xmath22 .",
    "the loop itself is assumed to have a finite inductance dominating the potential landscape .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is @xcite @xmath94 where the charging and inductive energies are @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 denotes the external magnetic flux through the loop ( in units of @xmath98 ) .",
    "the superconducting phase across the junction @xmath99 and the charge at the capacitor @xmath100 ( in units of electron charge ) are treated as conjugate observables @xmath101=2i$ ] . the charging term",
    "can be thought of as the kinetic energy and the @xmath102-dependent terms as an effective potential energy of a fictitious particle . in the following",
    "we assume that @xmath103 and @xmath104 so that the potential has a single minimum at @xmath105 , with @xmath106 . with these assumptions",
    "the phase is bound close to the minimum so that we can approximate the potential accurately by expanding the cosine term to the 4th order : @xmath107 the second line defining the quantities @xmath108 and @xmath109 . in general there",
    "should also be a @xmath110 term , but with @xmath106 this is small .",
    "further , within the mean - field approximation one has @xmath111 , producing just a shift in the origin .",
    "writing the charge and phase in terms of bosonic creation and annihilation operators we recover exactly eq .",
    "( [ nonlin ] ) with parameters @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "the current operator of the circuit is given by @xmath114 , where @xmath115 .",
    "thus , in the parameter regime @xmath116 we have effectively realized our weakly nonlinear resonator model .    .",
    "parameter values at @xmath117 as in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , except @xmath118 .",
    "inset : schematic of the squid setup with two linear reservoir circuits inductively coupled to a superconducting loop containing one josephson junction . ]    as the above considerations show , varying the externally applied field @xmath97 about @xmath119 moves the potential minimum @xmath120 which in turn changes the values of the parameters @xmath121 and @xmath26 . in particular ,",
    "@xmath26 is maximized at @xmath122 and vanishes when @xmath123 .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] demonstrates the resulting continuous tuning of rectification performance .",
    "in conclusion , we have analyzed heat rectification effects in radiative heat transport through a nonlinear quantum resonator .",
    "this system is particularly interesting because it can be realized by an experimentally feasible superconducting circuit .",
    "the proposed system is operated in a low - temperature regime and can be controlled by by applying external magnetic fields . despite its simplicity , the system is capable of producing a rectification of over 10% . we have shown that in a suitable parameter regime the direction of rectification changes as a function of temperature and given a physical explanation for the phenomena .",
