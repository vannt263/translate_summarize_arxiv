    "controllable pinning of magnetic domain walls will be a key enabler for domain wall - based spintronic devices such as memristors@xcite , shift registers@xcite and binary memory cells@xcite . in such devices domain walls",
    "are moved through what are generally sub - micron ferromagnetic strips wherein the state of the device is related to the physical position of the domain wall .",
    "stable domain wall positioning is often achieved via strong local structural modifications to the strip such as the introduction of notches@xcite or holes@xcite .",
    "such techniques have the advantage of allowing for the definition of the strip and the domain wall pinning sites in a single lithographic step .",
    "however , there can be challenges associated with the fabrication of multiple notches with identical pinning properties as well as non - trivial pinning effects at notches in multilayer devices@xcite .",
    "an alternative pinning method involves the definition of well - localized regions within the strip where the local ( effective ) magnetic field differs to that in the surrounding regions .",
    "this can be done via local modification of the strip s anisotropy @xcite or by using exchange@xcite or dipolar@xcite coupling between the strip and suitably placed sub - micron magnetic elements .",
    "here we build on previous work@xcite where we studied spatially periodic pinning potentials generated by dipolar coupling between a single periodic array of 0.2 @xmath3 m wide , magnetically hard nanoplatelets ( period = 1.2 @xmath3 m ) and a softer underlying continuous ultrathin ferromagnetic co layer . in this work",
    "we study arrays with inter - platelet spacings as small as @xmath40.1 @xmath3 m .",
    "the reduced inter - platelet spacings result in stronger nanoplatelet - induced reductions of the wall velocity within the thermally activated low field wall motion regime as well as increased pinning asymmetry ( see below ) .",
    "although we focus on pinning effects in a continuous magnetic film , the lithographic methods can be extended to strips .    in both our previous and current studies ,",
    "a 5 nm pt spacer separates the nanoplatelets from the underlying continuous film which ensures that coupling between the nanoplatelets and the film is primarily dipolar in nature .",
    "this allows for the periodic pinning potential to be introduced without significant modification to the physical structure of the ultrathin pt / co - based film below which ensures that the film s intrinsic weak disorder is not modified .",
    "this means that it is possible to study the effects of two independent but coexistent domain wall pinning potentials , one periodic , the other disordered .",
    "since domain walls in pt / co / pt films are described well by general theories for elastic interface motion in disordered systems@xcite , there is a fundamental interest in creating model experimental systems for studying interface motion where pinning effects can be controllably modified .",
    "one of the primary focuses of this article however will be pinning asymmetry : the nanoplatelet - induced pinning effects depend upon the relative orientation of the nanoplatelet magnetizations and the applied field , @xmath2 , that is used to drive domain wall propagation in the continuous layer . beyond providing field - polarity - dependent domain wall propagation ( and therefore tunable pinning ) , the asymmetry has a further consequence : for a given orientation of the nanoplatelet magnetizations , domain wall mediated switching of the continuous layer s magnetization results in a magnetic hysteresis loop which is not centered around @xmath5 , ie .",
    "it exhibits a ` dipolar bias ' .",
    "indeed , characteristics of this nanoplatelet - film system will be shown to be highly reminiscent of those seen in conventional ferromagnet / antiferromagnet exchange bias systems@xcite .",
    "to fabricate arrays of nanoplatelets above a continuous film , continuous multilayer co / pt stacks were first deposited by dc sputtering on si / sio@xmath6 substrates which were initially cleaned using an argon plasma .",
    "starting from the substrate , each film consists of a pt buffer layer , a co layer or co / pt / co stack , a pt spacer layer and an upper co / pt multilayer stack ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the individual co layers within each stack are coupled ferromagnetically across thin pt layers ( 1.6 or 1.8 nm ) which ensures a cooperative magnetic reversal of the layers @xcite .",
    "the lower , ultrathin , magnetically soft co layer structure is separated from the upper stack by a 5 nm thick pt spacer layer . as such , the effective fields@xcite associated with interlayer exchange and dipolar ` orange peel ' coupling are weak ( on the order of or less than 1 oe ) and in the final structure are dominated by the strong dipolar fields of the nanoplatelets ( see sec .  [ sec_pinning ] ) .",
    "the magnetically hard , upper co / pt multilayer stack was patterned to define 50 and 100 @xmath3 m wide arrays of nanoplatelets [ fig .",
    "[ fig_1](a ) ] . to do this ,",
    "a titanium mask was first fabricated on top of the film using electron beam lithography and then the entire sample was etched with a low energy ( 150 ev ) unfocussed argon ion beam .",
    "etching of the upper stack was monitored using secondary ion mass spectrometry ( sims ) and was halted upon reaching the pt spacer . in this way , arrays of hard ferromagnetic nanoplatelets could be defined whilst preserving the structure of the lower continuous layer .",
    "the upper stack was completely removed in the regions surrounding each array .",
    "four array geometries have been studied which had intended nanoplatelet size / spacing values ( in nm ) of x / y = 200/1000 ( see ref .  ) , 200/200 , 200/400 , 50/100 .",

    "both the continuous film and nanoplatelets retain a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy after patterning with the nanoplatelets displaying a rather broad distribution@xcite of switching fields lying approximately between 1.5 koe and 2.5 koe .",
    "these relatively high switching fields are advantageous here since they prevent unintended reversal of the nanoplatelets due to out of plane stray fields generated by neighboring nanoplatelets ( @xmath7 oe , see sec .

    "micromagnetic simulations were carried out using oommf @xcite by simulating the quasi - static , field driven motion of a domain wall through a 0.65 nm thick co film which is free of structural defects .",
    "the film lies in the @xmath66 plane ( fig .",
    "3 ) and is subject to a variable applied field @xmath67 as well as the calculated stray field , @xmath68 , of the nanoplatelets which would surround and be contained within the lateral calculation region .",
    "the domain wall moves in the @xmath69-direction and periodic boundary conditions@xcite were used in the @xmath70 direction .",
    "the following simulation parameters were used .",
    "cell size : @xmath71 nm@xmath72 , damping parameter : @xmath73 , saturation magnetization : @xmath74 a / m , exchange constant : @xmath75 j / m , uniaxial out of plane anisotropy energy density : @xmath76 j / m@xmath72 , stopping criterion : @xmath77/ns .",
    "for the pmoke experiments , domain walls were driven under positive field , @xmath14 , after setting @xmath10 . setting @xmath10  and preparing",
    "a positively magnetized domain entailed three steps for the p and d configurations and 2 steps for the ap configuration . in the p configuration ,",
    "the continuous layer and nanoplatelets were first positively magnetized ( @xmath13 ) under + 4 koe ( p step 1 ) . a negative field of about -1 koe",
    "was then applied to negatively magnetize the continuous layer ( p step 2 ) .",
    "short positive field pulses ( @xmath41 koe over @xmath4100 ns ) were then used to nucleate reversed , positively magnetized domains within the array which could be expanded under applied fields via domain wall propagation ( p step 3 ) . for the ap configuration ,",
    "the continuous layer and nanoplatelets were first negatively magnetized ( @xmath15 ) under -4 koe ( ap step 1 ) .",
    "short positive field pulses were then used to nucleate positively magnetized domains in the continuous layer which were expanded under @xmath14  ( ap step 2 = p step 3 ) . for the d configuration ,",
    "the array was demagnetized by saturating the nanoplatelets in 4 koe and then applying a field with opposite polarity and a magnitude that was chosen such that half of the dots reversed .",
    "p steps 2 and 3 were then carried out .",
    "images of both the initially nucleated domain and the field - expanded domain within the continuous layer were obtained at remanence using the pmoke microscope . the area swept out by the domain wall front ( and thus the front s displacement )",
    "was determined by subtracting the two images .",
    "the velocity was then determined by dividing the wall displacement by the pulse length . for short pulses , where the rise time was comparable to the total pulse length , a multiple pulse method was used which removed effects from the transient parts of the pulse@xcite .",
    "mfm imaging was carried out with a veeco / digital instruments dimension 3100 using a cocr coated tip with a resonant frequency on the order of 70 khz .",
    "the cocr sputtering time for the deposition of the cocr was chosen to provide a tip which would give good contrast while minimizing interactions with the sample and associated tip - induced domain wall displacement .",
    "interleaved scans at @xmath41 line / s were used with a tip height of 30 nm .    domain preparation for mfm imaging",
    "was performed using similar procedures to those described for pmoke microscopy except that ( i ) for the p and ap measurements , the array was in the @xmath13  state and @xmath14  and @xmath50  fields were respectively used to obtain the p and ap configurations , ( ii ) domains were nucleated outside the arrays and then injected inside the arrays using fields on the order of 100 oe and ( iii ) to prepare the d state , the sample was submitted to a slow oscillating field with decreasing amplitude ( from @xmath784 koe to 0 oe ) .",
    "the gray loop in fig .  [ fig_hyst](a , left ) is that obtained by preparing a wall just outside the field of view of the pmoke microscope and then stepping the field from @xmath5 ( @xmath79 s and @xmath80 oe ) while measuring a spatially averaged remanent hysteresis loop in a region without nanoplatelets . despite nucleation",
    "not being the defining factor for the onset of reversal , a finite coercivity is still observed due to domain wall pinning by intrinsic structural inhomogeneities in the continuous layer .",
    "this wall - limited coercivity is @xmath81 oe . although noticeably smaller than the nucleation - limited coercive field of @xmath47 oe obtained in the region just next to the arrays , caution must be taken when directly comparing the two values since different field application sequences have been used .",
