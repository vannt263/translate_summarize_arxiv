    "an important task in science and technology is to find the highest achievable precision in measuring and estimating parameters of interest with given resources , and design schemes to reach it .",
    "quantum metrology , which exploits quantum mechanical effects to achieve high precision , has gained increasing attention in recent years@xcite , where a typical situation is to estimate the value of a continuous parameter @xmath0 encoded in some quantum state @xmath1 of the system . to estimate the value",
    ", one needs to first perform measurements on the system , which , in the general form , are described by positive operator valued measurements(povm ) , @xmath2 , which provides a distribution for the measurement results @xmath3 . according to the cramr - rao bound in statistical theory@xcite",
    ", the standard deviation for any unbiased estimator of @xmath0 , based on the measurement results @xmath4 , is bounded below by the fisher information : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the standard deviation of the estimation of @xmath0 , and @xmath7 is the fisher information of the measurement results , @xmath8@xcite .",
    "the fisher information can be further optimized over all povms , which gives @xmath9 where the optimized value @xmath10 ) is called quantum fisher information@xcite .",
    "if the above process is repeated @xmath11 times , then the standard deviation of the estimator is bounded by @xmath12    to achieve the best precision , we can further optimize the encoding procedures @xmath13 so that @xmath14 is maximized .",
    "typically the encoding is achieved by preparing the probe in some initial state @xmath15 , then let it evolve under a dynamics which contains the interested parameter , @xmath16 .",
    "usually @xmath17 is determined by a given physical dynamics which is then fixed , while the initial state is up to our choice and can be optimized . a pivotal task in quantum metrology",
    "is to find out the optimal initial state @xmath15 and the corresponding maximum quantum fisher information under any given evolution @xmath17 .",
    "when @xmath17 is unitary the ghz - type of states are known to be optimal which leads to the heisenberg limit .",
    "however when @xmath17 is noisy , such states are in general no longer optimal . finding the optimal probe states and the corresponding highest precision limit under general dynamics has been the main quest of the field .",
    "recently using the purification approach much progress has been made on developing systematical methods of calculating the highest precision limit@xcite , however how to actually achieve the highest precision limit is still largely unknown , as these methods do not provide ways to obtain the optimal probe states .",
    "another restriction of these methods@xcite is that they usually restrict to smooth representations of the kraus operators , which is not intrinsic to the dynamics .    in this article",
    ", we develop a general framework for quantum parameter estimation which relates the ultimate precision limit directly to the geometrical properties of underlying dynamics , this provides systematical methods for computing the ultimate precision limit and optimal probe states without additional assumptions .",
    "this framework also provides analytical formulas for the precision limit with arbitrary pure probe states which spares the needs of optimization over equivalent kraus operators required in previous studies@xcite .",
    "we further demonstrate the power of the framework by deriving sufficient conditions on when ancillary systems are not useful for improving the precision limit .",
    "the precision limit of measuring @xmath0 from a set of quantum states @xmath1 is determined by the distinguishability between @xmath1 and its neighboring states @xmath18@xcite .",
    "this is best seen if we expand the bures distance between the neighboring states @xmath1 and @xmath18 up to the second order of @xmath19@xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 , here @xmath22 is the fidelity between two states . thus maximizing the quantum fisher information is equivalent as maximizing the bures distance , which is equivalent as minimizing the fidelity between @xmath1 and @xmath18 .",

    "we will first show how to compute the bures angle between unitary channels , then generalize to noisy quantum channels .      given two unitaries @xmath37 and @xmath38 of the same dimension , since @xmath39",

    "this provides ways to compute bures angles on unitary channels .",

    "then @xmath57&=b[i , u^\\dagger(x)u(x+dx)]\\\\                  & = b[i,(e^{-ihtdx})^{\\otimes n}].\\\\ \\endaligned\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is easy to see that the difference between the maximal eigen - angle and the minimal eigen - angle of @xmath58 is @xmath59 .",
    "thus @xmath60 eq.([eq : precision ] ) then recovers the heisenberg limit @xmath61      for a general quantum channel which maps from a @xmath62- to @xmath63-dimensional hilbert space , the evolution can be represented by a kraus operation @xmath64 , here the kraus operators @xmath65 , are of the size @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "the channel can be equivalently represented as @xmath68 where @xmath69 denotes some standard state of the environment , and @xmath70 is a unitary operator acting on both system and environment , which we will call as the unitary extension of @xmath71 .",

    "given a channel an ancillary system can be used to improve the precision limit , this can be described as the extended channel @xmath77 here @xmath78 represents a state of the original and ancillary systems .",
    "without loss of generality , the ancillary system can be assumed to have the same dimension as the original system .    given two quantum channels @xmath79 and @xmath80 of the same dimension , let @xmath81 and @xmath82 as unitary extensions of @xmath79 and @xmath80 respectively , we have@xcite @xmath83",

    "this restriction was introduced out of computational convenience in previous studies , which is not intrinsic to the dynamics .",
    "the formula here does not have such assumption and can be applied more broadly , for example it can be applied to the discrimination of quantum channels which is discrete in nature@xcite .",
    "also since any @xmath94 that is not optimal gives a lower bound on the precision limit , the formula here also provides more room for obtaining useful lower bounds .",
    "the maximization in eq.([eq : maxqfiopen ] ) can be further formulated as a semi - definite programming and solved efficiently : @xmath108 @xmath109 another advantage of this formulation is that the dual form of this semi - definite programming provides a systematical way for obtaining the optimal probe states , which we will show in the next setion .",
    "developing systematical methods to obtain the optimal probe states are essential for achieving the precision limit . so far there are only a few cases for which optimal probe states are known , mostly for phase estimations@xcite . a systematical way of obtaining optimal probe states for general quantum dynamics is highly desired as it will pave the way for achieving the ultimate precision limit .",
    "we now show how to obtain the optimal probe states that achieve the ultimate precision limit for extended channels .",

    "this sufficient condition is satisfied by unitary , classical and phase estimation with dephasing channel , and many other channels that have not been categorized before , for example phase estimation with noises along the @xmath164 and @xmath165 directions satisfies this condition , as it can be represented with two following kraus operators @xmath166 and @xmath167 , one can easily check that they satisfy the condition thus ancillary system does not help improving the ultimate precision limit for this channel .",
