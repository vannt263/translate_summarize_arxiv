    "graded materials with spatial gradients in their structure  @xcite are abundant in nature , which have received much attention as one of the advanced inhomogeneous composite materials in diverse engineering applications  @xcite .",
    "these materials can be made to realize quite different physical properties from the homogeneous materials , and thus , to some extent , more useful and interesting . for graded materials , the traditional theories  @xcite for homogeneous materials do not work any longer .",
    "recently , we presented a first - principles approach  @xcite and a differential effective dipole approximation ( deda )  @xcite , to investigate the dielectric properties of the graded materials . to our interest ,",
    "the two methods have been demonstrated in excellent agreement between each other  @xcite . in the case of graded materials , the problem will become more complicated by the presence of nonlinearity inside them .",
    "fortunately , for deriving the equivalent nonlinear susceptibility of graded particles , we have succeeded in putting forth a nonlinear differential effective dipole approximation ( ndeda )  @xcite .",
    "as expected , this ndeda has also been demonstrated in excellent agreement with a first - principles approach  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the finite - frequency response of nonlinear composite materials have attracted much attention both in research and industrial applications during the last two decades  @xcite .",
    "when a composite with linear / nonlinear particles embedded in a linear / nonlinear host medium is subjected to a sinusoidal electric field , the electrical response in the composite will generally consist of alternating current ( ac ) fields at frequencies of higher - order harmonics  @xcite .",
    "in fact , a convenient method of probing the nonlinear characteristics of the composite is to measure the harmonics of the nonlinear polarization under the application of a sinusoidal electric field  @xcite .",
    "the strength of the nonlinear polarization should be reflected in the magnitude of the harmonics .",
    "for the purpose of extracting such harmonics , the perturbation expansion  @xcite and self - consistent methods  @xcite can be used .    in this work , based on the ndeda",
    ", we shall investigate the effect of gradation ( inhomogeneity ) inside the particles ( inclusions ) on the ac responses of the graded composite by making use of a perturbation expansion method  @xcite . here ,",
    "the composite under consideration is composed of linear / nonlinear graded particles which are randomly embedded in a linear / nonlinear host medium in the dilute limit . to this end",
    ", it is shown that the fundamental and third - order harmonic ac responses are sensitive to the dielectric - constant ( or nonlinear - susceptibility ) gradation profile within the particle .",
    "thus , by measuring the ac responses of the graded composites , it is possible to perform a real - time monitoring of the fabrication process of the gradation profiles within graded particles .    this paper is organized as follows . in the following section , we shall present the formalism , which is followed by the numerical results in section  [ numericalresults ] . in section  [ discon ] ,",
    "the discussion and conclusion will be given .",
    "let s consider nonlinear graded spherical particles with radius @xmath0 and dielectric gradation profile @xmath1 inside it , being embedded in a nonlinear host medium of dielectric constant @xmath2 , in the presence of a uniform external electric field @xmath3 along @xmath4axis . here",
    "@xmath5 or @xmath6 ( @xmath7 or @xmath8 ) denotes the corresponding linear dielectric constant ( nonlinear susceptibility ) , @xmath9 and @xmath10 stands for the local electric field inside the particles and the host medium , respectively .",
    "note both gradation profiles @xmath5 and @xmath7 are radial functions where @xmath11 throughout the paper , we shall consider the case of weak nonlinearity only , that is , @xmath12 and @xmath13      recently , we put forth a deda ( differential effective dipole approximation )  @xcite for calculating the equivalent dielectric constant @xmath14  @xcite of the spherical graded particle .",
    "this deda receives the form @xmath15\\cdot[\\bep_1(r)+2\\ep_1(r ) ] } { r\\ep_1(r)}.\\label{deda}\\ ] ] note eq .",
    "( [ deda ] ) is just the tartar formula , derived for assemblages of spheres with varying radial and tangential conductivity  @xcite .",
    "so far , the equivalent @xmath16 for the whole graded particle can be calculated , at least numerically , by solving the differential equation [ eq .  ( [ deda ] ) ] , as long as @xmath5 ( dielectric - constant gradation profile ) is given .",
    "once @xmath16 is determined , we can readily take one step forward to obtain the volume average of the linear local electric field inside the particles as @xmath17 hence , the deda [ eq .  ( [ deda ] ) ]",
    "offers a convenient way to obtain the local electric field [ eq .  ( [ localfield ] ) ] .",
    "it is worth remarking that the deda [ eq .  ( [ deda ] ) ] is valid for arbitrary gradation profiles .    to show the correctness of eq .",
    "( [ localfield ] ) , we shall alternatively present a first - principles approach for calculating the local electric field inside the particle . for this purpose ,",
    "let s take the power - law gradation profile ( @xmath18 ) as a model .",
    "for this profile , the potential within the graded particle can be given by solving the electrostatic equation , @xmath19  @xcite , @xmath20 where the coefficient @xmath21 is determined by performing appropriate boundary conditions , @xmath22 and @xmath23/2.$ ] based on the relation between the linear local electric field and the potential ( @xmath24 ) , we have @xmath25\\hat{{\\bf z}}\\},\\label{fp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the unit vectors along @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath4axes , respectively .",

    "the effective dielectric constant of the system ( @xmath47 ) is given by the following dilute - limit expression , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the volume fraction of the particles . by virtue of the inversion symmetry ,",

    "it is known that the perturbation expansion method is applicable to weak nonlinearity only , limited by the convergence of the series expansion .",

    "for numerical calculations , we take @xmath79 , and other parameters : volume fraction @xmath80 external field strength @xmath81 linear part of host dielectric constant @xmath82    the validation of using the deda is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "in this figure , we investigate the linear local electric field by using a power - law gradation profile inside the particles , in an attempt to compare the deda with the first - principles approach .",
    "as expected , the excellent agreement is demonstrated between the deda [ eq .",
    "( [ localfield ] ) ] and the first - principles approach [ eq .  ( [ volume ] ) ] .",
    "in addition , it is worth noting that , for a linear gradation profile within the graded particles , the first - principles approach holds as well  @xcite , and the excellent agreement between the two methods can also be found ( figure not shown here ) .",
    "next , we discuss a power - law gradation profile @xmath83,$ ] see fig .  2 .",
    "in this figure , the harmonics of local electric field and the induced dipole moment are investigated as a function of @xmath84 for various @xmath85 in this case , increasing @xmath84 ( or decreasing @xmath86 ) leads to increasing @xmath41 ( namely , the equivalent dielectric constant of the graded particle under consideration ) and in turn yields a decreasing local electric field inside the particle .",
    "thus , either an increase in @xmath84 or a decrease in @xmath86 leads to the weakening third - order harmonics @xmath87 and @xmath88 as displayed in fig .  2 .",
    "the @xmath28axes of figs .",
    "3  and  4 represent the slope ( @xmath89 ) of a linear gradation profile .",
    "it is because during the fabrication of graded spherical particles by using diffusion , the dielectric constant at the center @xmath90 may vary slightly while that at the grain boundary can change substantially .    for a linear gradation profile @xmath91,$ ]",
    "3 shows the harmonics as a function of @xmath89 for various @xmath92 in this case , increasing @xmath89 or @xmath90 yield increasing @xmath93 and hence one obtains the decreasing local electric field . as a result ,",

    "4 displays the effect of @xmath8 on the harmonics , for a linear gradation profile @xmath91.$ ] here , increasing @xmath8 leads to increasing the local electric field inside the graded particle of interest .",
    "therefore , the third - order harmonics @xmath87 and @xmath95 increase for increasing @xmath96    as mentioned above , as @xmath84 and @xmath89 increases , the equivalent dielectric constant of the particle should be increased accordingly , which in turn yields a decreasing local electric field , and hence , in figs .  2@xmath974",
    ", @xmath69 decreases for increasing @xmath84 or @xmath98 on the other hand , it is found that , in figs .  2@xmath974 , @xmath73 increases for increasing @xmath84 or @xmath89 which is , in fact , due to the increasing effective dielectric constant @xmath47 [ refer to eq .",
    "( [ dm ] ) ] .",
    "similarly , this analysis works fairly for understanding the effect of @xmath86 and @xmath90 on @xmath69 and @xmath73 , as displayed in figs .  2  and  3 .",
    "however , increasing @xmath8 can increase not only the local electric field inside the particles , but also the effective dielectric constant @xmath99 and hence we observe increasing @xmath69 and @xmath100 as shown in fig .",
    "in addition , we also discuss the effect of nonlinear - susceptibility gradation profiles ( no figures shown here ) . for linear gradation profile @xmath79 ,",
    "as @xmath101 ( or @xmath102 ) increases , the third harmonics of both the electric field and the induced dipole moment increases accordingly . on the other hand , for pow - law gradation profile @xmath103 , increasing @xmath104 ( or decreasing @xmath105 ) leads to increasing third harmonics . to understand such results",
    ", we can again resort to the above analysis on the effect of the relevant parameters on the local field as well as the effective dielectric constant .",
    "here some comments are in order .",
    "we investigate the nonlinear ac responses of the graded material where linear / nonlinear graded particles are randomly embedded in a linear / nonlinear host medium in the dilute limit . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the ndeda ( nonlinear differential effective dipole approximation ) is valid for arbitrary gradation profiles , besides the power - law and linear profiles of interest .",
    "in particular , based on the first - principles approach , the exact solution is obtainable , for not only power - law profiles ( see section  [ comparison ] ) , but also linear profiles ( refer to ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    as an extension ,",
    "it is of particular interest to see what happens to the nonlinear ac responses of graded particles in electrorheological fluids , in which a field - induced anisotropic structure often occurs . for discussing this anisotropy effect",
    ", we can make use of the maxwell - garnett approximation for anisotropic structures  @xcite .    to sum up , based on our recently - established ndeda",
    ", we have investigated the nonlinear ac responses of a composite with linear / nonlinear graded spherical particles embedded in a linear / nonlinear host medium , and found the fundamental and third harmonic ac responses are sensitive to the dielectric - constant ( or nonlinear - susceptibility ) gradation profile within the particles .",
