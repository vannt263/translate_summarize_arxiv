    "in materials analysis and design , contact problems in elasticity are central to the modelling and investigation of many structural systems .",
    "in particular , the analysis of soft tissue biomechanics and the design of bioinspired synthetic structures involve non - linear hyperelastic models for which the mathematical and numerical treatment poses many physical , theoretical , and computational challenges @xcite .",
    "hyperelastic materials are the class of material models described by a strain energy density function @xcite . for these materials ,",
    "boundary value problems are often equivalent to variational problems , which provide powerful methods for obtaining approximate solutions .",
    "they can also be used to generate finite element methods for which the numerical analysis stands on the shoulder of the mathematical analysis for the elastic model @xcite .",
    "the complexity of contact problems modelling structural systems is generally associated with the detection of contacts and openings and the resolution of non - linear equations for contact .",
    "for example , in systems formed from linear elastic bodies ( _ e.g. _ ceramics , metals ) , surface roughness can impede active contact when a surface is pressed against another , and contact forces can not be transmitted where surface separation occurs @xcite . by contrast , non - linear elastic bodies ( _ e.g. _ rubber , soft tissue ) are more pliable and thus capable of attaining more active support through which contact forces can be transmitted effectively @xcite .",
    "these problems can be formulated and solved in the framework of variational inequalities @xcite , which originated in the paper by fichera @xcite on the existence and uniqueness of solution to the celebrated _ signorini problem _ with _ ambiguous boundary conditions _ @xcite . while signorini problem consisted in finding the equilibrium state of an elastic body resting on a rigid frictionless surface , the influence of variational inequalities went beyond the fields of mathematical analysis , optimization , and mechanics @xcite , leading also to new models in game theory , economics , and finance .    in large strain elasticity , the study of finite dimensional structural models is motivated by the increasing need for effective computational techniques required in practical applications , but little attention has been paid to date to the underpinning infinite dimensional problems which are fundamental in the development of new methods . for example , while the reciprocal theorems of stationary potential and complementary energy are well known in the infinitesimal theory of elasticity and in the theory of structures @xcite , for large strain deformations , the stress - strain relation is non - linear , and its inverse is not uniquely defined in general , either locally or globally . for systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom , extensions of the reciprocal principles have been proposed in @xcite . for an elastic continuum , assuming that the stress - strain relation is invertible , a complementary energy principle in terms of stresses was formulated via a legendre transformation on the strain energy function in @xcite . in order to avoid the difficulty of inverting the constitutive relation , in @xcite , trial functions for the deformation gradient instead of the stress tensor are used to obtain a variational principle of the complementary energy type .",
    "then , under appropriate conditions , the stationary potential energy and complementary energy principles become extremum principles which can be used to provide lower and upper bounds on physical quantities of interest .    in the present study , the variational approach of @xcite",
    "is extended first to the problem of a non - linear hyperelastic body in unilateral contact with a rigid surface , then to the case of two hyperelastic bodies in mutual non - penetrative contact .",
    "for each of these problems , the corresponding variational models take the form of two continuous optimization problems with inequality constraints , the solutions of which can be used to provide upper and lower bounds for the uniform external loading acting away from the contact zone .",
    "to illustrate the theory , analytical upper and lower bounds for the external load of a system formed from two elastic bodies in mutual unilateral contact and subject to large compression or bending , which can be maintained in every homogeneous isotropic incompressible hyperelastic material in the absence of body forces , are obtained .    in practice ,",
    "contact problems with large stresses and strains at the adjoining material surfaces arise , for example , when creases are formed and self - contact takes place in soft materials and structures @xcite , or in biological systems where the attachment between cells are sufficiently weak so that cells separate , and failure through the appearance of gaps between cells occurs @xcite . although cell debonding is a spontaneous mechanism for crack initiation in many natural structures , it has been less investigated to date @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organised as follows : in section  [ cc : sec : problem : one ] , the equilibrium problem is formulated for a non - linear elastic body in non - penetrative contact with itself or with a rigid obstacle , in the absence of friction forces ; in sections  [ cc : sec : bounds ] and [ cc : sec : bounds : con ] , variational problems are derived and analysed for the upper and lower bounds on the total strain energy of a finitely deformed elastic body made from a compressible or an incompressible material , respectively ; in section  [ cc : sec : problem : two ] , the variational approach is extended to the case of two elastic bodies in mutual non - penetrative contact , and examples where the elastic bodies are made from a neo - hookean material and subject to large compression or bending are presented .",

    "in large deformations , elastic bodies are very likely to enter into contact with neighbouring obstacles or with themselves , and therefore both the mathematical models and their analysis must take these phenomena into account . in this paper , for an elastic body made from an homogeneous isotropic non - linear hyperleastic material in unilateral contact with a rigid obstacle or with another elastic body , trial functions for the deformation gradient were used to obtain a variational principle of stationary complementary energy type .",
    "then the stationary potential energy and complementary energy principles were used to provide an enclosure on the total strain energy of the finitely deformed body . to illustrate the theory ,",
    "this variational framework was applied to determine upper and lower bounds on the external load for a system made from two elastic bodies of neo - hookean material under uniform compression or under combined stretch and bending .",
    "this investigation addresses the need for a better understanding of contact problems in natural and industrial systems where mechanical models that take into account the large stresses and strains at adjoining material surfaces are crucial .",
