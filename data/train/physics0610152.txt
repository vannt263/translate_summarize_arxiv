    "basic principles of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) were formulated to the beginning of 1930 s as the result of merging quantum mechanics and special relativity . this theory provided description of such low - order processes as emission and absorption of photons and creation and annihilation of electron - positron pairs .",
    "however , application of this theory to calculations of some higher - order effects gave infinite results .",
    "this problem remained unsolved till the late of 1940 s , when lamb and retherford discovered the @xmath1 splitting in hydrogen , which is presently known as the lamb shift .",
    "this discovery stimulated theorists to complete the creation of qed since it was believed that this splitting is of qed origin .",
    "first evaluation of the lamb shift was given by bethe .",
    "the rigorous qed formalism was developed by dyson , feynman , schwinger and tomonaga .",
    "they found that all divergences can be removed from the theory by the renormalization procedure .",
    "all calculations in qed are based on the perturbation theory in a small parameter , which is the fine structure constant @xmath2 .",
    "individual terms of the perturbation series are conveniently represented by feynman diagrams .",
    "for instance , the lowest - order contribution to the lamb shift in a h - like atom is determined by so - called self - energy and vacuum - polarization diagrams , presented in fig . 1 .    till the beginning of 1980 s tests of quantum electrodynamics",
    "were mainly restricted to light atomic systems : hydrogen , helium , positronium , and muonium . in these systems ,",
    "in addition to @xmath3 , there is another small parameter , which is @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is the nuclear charge number ) .",
    "for this reason , calculations of light atoms were based on expansion in these two parameters .",
    "it means that with light atomic systems we can test qed only to few lowest orders in the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 . a unique opportunuty to study qed effects to all orders in @xmath4 appeared in experiments with heavy few - electron ions , such as , for instance , h - like uranium or li - like uranium .",
    "high - precision experiments with these ions became possible in the last two decades @xcite . in heavy few - electron ions",
    "the number of electrons is much smaller than the nuclear charge number .",
    "for this reason , to the zeroth - order approximation , we can neglect the interelectronic interaction and consider that the electrons interact only with the coulomb field of the nucleus .",
    "the interelectronic - interaction and qed effects are accounted for by perturbation theory in the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath3 , respectively @xcite . for very heavy ions",
    "the parameter @xmath6 becomes comparable with @xmath3 and , therefore , all contributions can be classified by the parameter @xmath3 .",
    "but , in contrast to light atoms , the parameter @xmath4 is no longer small .",
    "it means that all calculations must be performed without any expansion in the parameter @xmath4 .",
    "to the zeroth - order approximation , a hydrogenlike ion is described by the dirac equation with the coulomb field of the nucleus ( @xmath7 ) : @xmath8 for the point - charge nucleus , @xmath9 , this equation can be solved analytically ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . to get the binding energy to a higher accuracy we need to evaluate quantum electrodynamic and nuclear corrections .",
    "the finite - nuclear - size correction is evaluated by solving the dirac equation with the potential induced by an extended nuclear charge - density distribution and taking the difference between the energies for the extended and point - charge nucleus .",
    "this can be done either numerically ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) or analytically @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the nonrelativistic case , where the corresponding correction is completely defined by the root - mean - square nuclear radius @xmath10 , in heavy ions the higher - order moments of the nuclear charge distribution may affect the nuclear - size correction on a 1% accuracy level .",
    "the qed corrections of first order in @xmath3 are determined by the self - energy ( se ) and vacuum - polarization ( vp ) diagrams ( fig .",
    "high - precision calculation of the se diagram to all orders in @xmath4 was performed by mohr @xcite while the vp diagram was first evaluated by soff and mohr @xcite and by manakov _",
    "nowadays calculation of these diagrams causes no problem .",
    "the qed corrections of second order in @xmath3 are determined by diagrams depicted in fig .",
    "most of these diagrams can be evaluated by adopting the methods developed for the first - order se and vp corrections @xcite .",
    "the most difficult task consists in evaluation of the se - se diagrams and the combined se - vp diagrams presented in the last row of fig .",
    "the whole gauge - invariant set of the se - se diagrams was calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite . as to the combined se - vp diagrams mentioned above , to date they have been evaluated only in the free - electron - loop approximation ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "next , one should consider the nuclear recoil effect .",
    "it is known that in the nonrelativistic theory of a hydrogenlike atom the nuclear recoil effect can easily be taken into account using the reduced electron mass , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the nuclear mass . but",
    "this is not the case in the relativistic theory .",
    "the full relativistic theory of the recoil effect can be formulated only in the framework of qed .",
    "for a hydrogenlike ion , a closed expression for the recoil effect to first order in @xmath13 accounting for the complete @xmath4-dependence was derived in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref . @xcite and references therein ) . numerical evaluation of this expression to all orders in @xmath4 was performed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally , one should take into account the nuclear polarization correction , which sets the ultimate accuracy limit up to which qed can be tested with heavy ions .",
    "this correction is determined by the electron - nucleus interaction diagrams in which the intermediate nuclear states are excited .",
    "it was evaluated in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the individual contributions to the ground - state lamb shift in @xmath14 , which is defined as the difference between the exact binding energy and the binding energy derived from the dirac equation for the point - charge nucleus , are given in table 1 .",
    "the finite - nuclear - size correction is evaluated for the fermi model of the nuclear charge distribution with @xmath15 fm @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty of this correction is estimated by adding quadratically two errors , one obtained by varying the root - mean - square radius and the other obtained by changing the model of the nuclear - charge distribution from the fermi to the homogeneously - charged - sphere model . according to the table",
    ", the present status of the theory and experiment on the ground - state lamb shift in @xmath14 provides a test of qed on the level of about 2% .    .ground - state lamb shift in @xmath14 , in ev . [ cols=\"<,^ \" , ]",
    "the g - factor of an ion can be defined as the ratio of the magnetic moment of the ion to its mechanical moment , expressed in the bohr magnetons .",
    "high - precision measurements of the g factor of h - like carbon @xcite and oxygen @xcite have triggered a great interest to related theoretical calculations ( see refs . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , these studies provided a new determination of the electron mass to an accuracy which is four times better than that of the previously accepted value @xcite .",
    "an extension of the g - factor investigations to higher - z ions could also lead to an independent determination of the fine structure constant @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of such a determination is , however , strongly limited by a large uncertainty of the nuclear structure effects which strongly increases when @xmath5 is growing @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the ultimate accuracy limit can be significantly reduced in the difference @xmath16}-\\xi g^{[1s]}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17}$ ] and @xmath18}$ ] denote the g - factors of @xmath19pb@xmath20 and @xmath19pb@xmath21 , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 must be chosen to cancel the nuclear size effect in this difference . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that measurements of the g factor of b- and h - like lead to the same accuracy as for carbon , accompanied by the corresponding theoretical calculations , can provide a determination of @xmath3 to a higher acuracy than that from the recent compillation by mohr and taylor @xcite .",
    "this method can also compete in accuracy with the new determination of @xmath3 by gabrielse and co - workers @xcite .",
    "the @xmath23 pnc transition amplitude in neutral @xmath24cs @xcite remains one of the most attractive subject for tests of the standard model ( sm ) at low energies .",
    "the measurement of this amplitude to a @xmath25% accuracy @xcite has stimulated theorists to improve the related calculations .",
    "these improvements , that included evaluations of the breit interaction @xcite , more precise calculations of the electron - correlation effects @xcite , and calculation of the vacuum - polarization part of the qed correction @xcite , gave the value for the weak charge of the cesium nucleus , which deviates by 2@xmath26 from the prediction of the standard model .",
    "this discrepancy urgently required calculations of the self - energy part of the qed correction .",
    "evaluation of the whole gauge - invariant set of the se corrections to the pnc transition amplitude with the dirac - fock wave functions was performed in ref .",
    "the total result for the binding qed correction was found to amount to @xmath27% .",
    "this value differs from the previous results for the total binding qed effect , @xmath28% @xcite and @xmath29% @xcite .",
    "the discrepency can be explained by some approximations made in the previos calculations .",
    "in particular , instead of calculating the qed corrections to the pnc amplitude , the previous papers were dealing with evaluation of the qed corrections to the pnc mixing coefficient which is a rather artificial subject for qed .",
    "however , a semiempirical revision of the previous results @xcite gave a value for the qed correction which is very close to that of ref .",
    "@xcite .    combining the qed correction with other theoretical contributions and comparing the total pnc amplitude with the experiment for an average value for the vector transition polarizabilty , @xmath30 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , one obtains for the weak charge of @xmath24cs : @xmath31 this value deviates from the sm prediction of @xmath3273.19(13 ) @xcite by 1.1 @xmath26 . further progress on the pnc tests in @xmath24cs can be achieved either by more accurate atomic structure calculations or by more precise measurements .",
