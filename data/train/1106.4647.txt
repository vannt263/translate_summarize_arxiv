    "recently , the faraday instability , _ i.e. _ the parametric instability of a fluid layer submitted to vertical vibrations @xcite , has appeared as a useful experiment to probe the interplay between the microstructure of various complex fluids and a classical hydrodynamic instability @xcite .",
    "most previous experimental works have focused on the effects of viscoelasticity on the instability threshold @xcite , on the subharmonic vs. harmonic response of the surface waves @xcite , and on the influence of the microstructure on the surface wave pattern @xcite . in shear - thinning semidilute solutions of polymers and of surfactant wormlike micelles ,",
    "these effects are generally rather small perturbations to the classical instability of newtonian fluids .",
    "however , much stronger effects were found in a few other complex materials , namely clay suspensions @xcite , shear - thickening cornstarch suspensions @xcite , and dilute shear - thickening wormlike micelles @xcite , where localized hysteretic finger - like structures , persistent holes , and high - amplitude strip waves were respectively reported .",
    "these original observations were qualitatively interpreted @xcite and quantitatively modelled @xcite as a strong feedback of the surface waves on the fluid microstructure : the oscillatory shear generated by small - amplitude perturbations triggers large variations of the shear rate - dependent viscosity that lead to discontinuous transitions to large - amplitude waves .    still , to the best of our knowledge , no direct experimental evidence for strong structural modifications induced by faraday waves has been reported .",
    "the aim of the present study is to address this issue in suspensions of _ fd _ virus , a rodlike colloid that presents liquid crystalline phases @xcite .",
    "these viruses are known to easily align under minute external perturbations and the local organization of their microstructure can be simply probed by visualizing the birefringence field @xcite . here , three suspensions of _ fd _ viruses at various concentrations , respectively deep into the isotropic domain , close to the isotropic ",
    "nematic transition , and in the nematic phase , are submitted to vertical vibrations . after a brief description of the samples and of the experimental set up , we first report on surface wave amplitude measurements that present a strong hysteresis at the onset of the faraday instability .",
    "this subcritical behaviour is accounted for by a simple model based on the shear - thinning properties of our rodlike colloids .",
    "we then move to birefringence experiments that reveal local nematic ordering in vibrated suspensions that are initially isotropic at rest .",
    "these measurements are successfully compared to numerical simulations based on a smoluchowski approach  @xcite .",
    "our results point to the existence of an out - of - equilibrium phase transition induced by a hydrodynamic instability in suspensions of rodlike colloids .",
    "our working fluids are suspensions of _ fd _ viruses in a buffer of 20  mm tris - hcl at ph=8.15 as described in ref .",
    "bacteriophage is a nearly perfectly monodisperse rodlike colloid of length @xmath0  nm , diameter @xmath1  nm , and persistence length @xmath2  @xmath3 m .",

    "is added to the buffer to obtain an ionic concentration of 20  mm .",
    "this system presents various phases when the concentration @xmath7 of _ fd _ virus is increased : isotropic , cholesteric , and smectic @xcite .",
    "because the free energy between the cholesteric phase and a nematic state is very low , we shall simply refer to the cholesteric phase as nematic in the following .",
    "we consider suspensions either in the isotropic or in the nematic phase by focusing on three different samples : an isotropic suspension of concentration @xmath8  mg@xmath9ml well below the isotropic ",
    "nematic ( i  n ) phase transition , an isotropic suspension of concentration @xmath10 mg@xmath9ml just below the i ",
    "n phase transition , and a nematic sample of concentration @xmath11 mg@xmath9ml .",
    "when submitted to an external shear , _ fd _ viruses tend to align in the shear direction . deep into the isotropic phase",
    ", this alignment causes a dramatic decrease of the viscosity ( shear - thinning behaviour ) @xcite , while close to and above the i ",
    "n transition , more complex shear - induced phenomena such as vorticity banding , tumbling , and wagging have been reported @xcite .    a dedicated set up ( see fig .  [ fig_setup ] ) was developed in order to measure both the birefringence intensity and the amplitude of surface waves in a vertically vibrated layer of _ fd _ suspension .",
    "a parallelepipedic glass cell of length 72  mm , thickness 6  mm , and height 8  mm ( respectively corresponding to the @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 directions ) is filled up to a height @xmath15  mm with the suspension and vibrated by an electromagnetic shaker ( ling dynamic systems v406 ) .",
    "the driving acceleration is sinusoidal with amplitude @xmath16100  m.s@xmath17 and frequency @xmath18200  hz .",
    "the suspension is thermostated at @xmath19c by a water circulation beneath the cell .",
    "the cell is sealed by a pvc cover to prevent evaporation and surface contamination .",
    "it is placed between two polarizers and lit from the back .",
    "a fast ccd camera ( mikrotron mc1310 ) captures the transmitted light at @xmath20  fps . for each value of the acceleration @xmath21 and frequency @xmath22",
    ", we wait for two minutes so that a steady state is reached , after which two movies are recorded over twenty driving periods ( @xmath23 ) : ( i ) a first movie with aligned polarizers from which the amplitude @xmath24 is easily extracted as a function of the horizontal position @xmath12 and time @xmath25 and ( ii ) a second movie under crossed polarizers in order to measure the transmitted intensity field @xmath26 and to visualize the flow - induced birefringence.@xmath27 we checked that at the frequencies under study , the rather large aspect ratio of our experimental cell @xmath28 always enforces a one - dimensional surface wave pattern along the @xmath12 direction . in all cases ,",
    "the surface response was observed to be subharmonic so that @xmath24 is well described by : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the wave number , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 ( resp .",

    "phase ) of the @xmath34 harmonic . in our experiments",
    "@xmath35 , so that we will only consider @xmath36 in what follows .",
    "following classical protocols for detecting the onset of faraday waves , we first determine the critical acceleration @xmath37 , _ i.e. _ the acceleration above which parametric waves first appear at the fluid surface at a given driving frequency @xmath22 , by ( i ) increasing the acceleration @xmath21 by @xmath38 every two minutes and noting the acceleration @xmath39 when the surface first destabilizes , ( ii ) waiting for two more minutes for the surface to be fully destabilized and ( iii ) decreasing the acceleration by @xmath40 every two minutes until the surface becomes flat again , which defines a second acceleration @xmath41 .",
    "a striking difference with experiments in newtonian fluids is the presence of a large hysteresis in the instability onset : in all three _ fd _ suspensions , @xmath39 is about @xmath42 greater than @xmath41 . for comparison , in a newtonian fluid of similar viscosity",
    ", no hysteresis is detected , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath43 to within our precision of @xmath44 .    the measurements of the surface wave amplitude @xmath45 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) for the more dilute sample reveal that this hysteresis is associated with a discontinuous transition : above @xmath39 , the wave amplitude jumps directly to several hundreds of micrometers and drops abruptly to zero when @xmath21 is reduced by @xmath46 . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) and ( c ) , hysteresis is also observed for the sample close to the i ",
    "n transition and for the nematic sample .",
    "more precisely , the hysteresis gets more pronounced as one gets closer to the i ",
    "n transition , and abruptly decreases after the transition .",
    "this evolution with @xmath7 is reminiscent of that of the shear thinning properties of the sample  @xcite . in these two concentrated samples ,",
    "the hysteresis cycles also present more complex features and are less reproducible so that in the following we shall mostly focus on modelling the behaviour of the dilute sample . in any case , these effects are characteristic of a subcritical instability and can be attributed to the _ shear - thinning _ behaviour of our rodlike colloids . a simple argument relating shear - thinning",
    "to subcriticality is that a small perturbation of the surface may induce a shear rate that is large enough to significantly decrease the local viscosity , giving rise to a positive feedback on the perturbation and hence leading to finite wave amplitude at instability onset .",
    "as recalled above in the introduction , such an argument was the basis for a recent model by epstein and deegan @xcite who used piecewise linear fits of the viscosity vs. shear rate curve to account for high - amplitude strip waves in dilute wormlike micelle solutions .",
    "it was also shown that shear - thinning leads to a hysteretic , discontinuous transition .    however , the model of ref .",
    "@xcite was based on steady - shear rheology whereas the flow induced by faraday waves is _ oscillatory_. therefore , in the present study , we propose a simple alternative approach based on rheological measurements under large amplitude oscillatory shear .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows data recorded on the dilute sample using a standard rheometer ( ta instruments ar2000n ) .",
    "it is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) that , whatever the oscillation pulsation @xmath47 , the modulus of the complex viscosity @xmath48 as a function of the amplitude of the oscillatory shear rate @xmath49 is well fitted by the cross model @xcite : @xmath50 is a characteristic time , @xmath51 an exponent , and @xmath52 the solvent viscosity taken equal to the water viscosity ( @xmath53  pa.s ) .",
    "the coefficient @xmath54 can be interpreted as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the modulus of the zero - shear complex viscosity at @xmath47 .",
    "for all fits , we get @xmath57 and the dependence of @xmath58 and @xmath54 on @xmath47 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) and ( c ) respectively .",
    "since most classical rheometers are limited to oscillation frequencies below about 10  hz , we use quadratic fits in logarithmic scales to extrapolate both @xmath58 and @xmath54 to 50  hz , _",
    "i.e. _ to half the driving frequency used in the faraday experiment [ see red lines and green symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) and ( c ) ] .",
    "finally , in order to keep the analytical expressions tractable while including the above shear - thinning rheology , we shall thereafter replace the exponent @xmath59 by @xmath60 in eq .",
    "( [ eq.fit_rheo ] ) .",
    "we do not expect this approximation to change the results qualitatively but it should be noted that it sharpens the decrease of the viscosity around the characteristic shear rate @xmath61  s@xmath6 extrapolated at 50  hz .    coming back to faraday waves , the oscillating shear rate at the surface reads @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the critical wave number of the surface pattern ( obtained by considering half a mode in the @xmath13 direction @xcite : @xmath64 . for the dilute sample ,",
    "amplitude measurements give @xmath65  m and @xmath66  m@xmath6 at @xmath67  hz , yielding @xmath68  s@xmath6 .",
    "this shear rate is comparable to the characteristic shear rate @xmath69 [ see fig .  [ fig2](a ) ] so that a strong effect of faraday waves on the fluid viscosity is expected . at this stage ,",
    "a model based on the numerical integration of the mathieu equation could be developed following ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", however , we propose to stick with analytical expressions by considering our shear - thinning fluid as an _ effective newtonian fluid_. more precisely , provided the fluid layer is deep enough ( @xmath70 ) and the viscosity is low enough ( @xmath71 ) , which is indeed the case in our experiments where @xmath72 and @xmath73 , the local shear rate @xmath74 is known to decrease exponentially with the depth @xmath14 : @xmath75 where @xmath76 by convention  @xcite . using eq .",
    "( [ eq.fit_rheo ] ) with @xmath60 yields the @xmath14-dependence of the viscosity : @xmath77 , the viscosity of a newtonian fluid which dissipates the same energy as our colloidal suspension for a given surface wave amplitude @xmath45 , as : @xmath78 where @xmath70 was used to extend the integration from @xmath79 to @xmath80 . introducing the characteristic amplitude @xmath81 , eqs .",
    "( [ eq.2 ] ) and ( [ eq.3 ] ) readily lead to : @xmath82 finally , for newtonian fluids , it is well known that the amplitude of the surface wave should evolve with time as  @xcite : @xmath83 where @xmath37 is the critical acceleration , @xmath84 is the growth rate , and @xmath85 and @xmath86 are characteristic lengths linked to the dissipation process . for newtonian fluids of low viscosity , it was also shown that the critical acceleration is proportional to the viscosity  @xcite : @xmath87 .",
    "therefore , at equilibrium ( @xmath88 ) , combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq.3 ] ) and ( [ eq.4 ] ) yields the relationship between @xmath21 and @xmath45 : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the critical acceleration of the fluid at rest ( _ i.e. _ for @xmath91 ) and corresponds to the acceleration @xmath39 measured experimentally . when @xmath92 , the second - order expansion of the previous expression in @xmath93 reads : @xmath94 so that the instability is supercritical for @xmath95 and subcritical otherwise . in other words , when @xmath96 is small enough or equivalently when shear - thinning sets in at a low enough shear rate @xmath69 , subcriticality and hysteresis are expected in the faraday instability .",
    "figure  [ fig3](a ) shows that eq .",
    "( [ eq.7 ] ) provides a good fit of the experimental @xmath97 data with only two free parameters , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , since @xmath52 is known , @xmath90 is measured independently as @xmath39 , and @xmath54 is extracted from fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) .",
    "still , the predicted curve goes to zero for an acceleration smaller than the experimental @xmath41 .",
    "we believe that the main reasons for this discrepancy are the very simple form of eqs .",
    "( [ eq.2 ] ) and ( [ eq.3 ] ) along with possible dissipation at the walls induced by the presence of a meniscus , which is not taken into account in our simple model .",
    "we shall come back to the two more concentrated samples in the next section .",
    "the above model provides a link between hysteresis and shear - thinning induced by the alignment of the rodlike colloids .",
    "this alignment is directly confirmed experimentally in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that reports the analysis of the transmitted intensity field @xmath26 recorded over twenty driving periods with crossed polarizers:@xmath27 the minimum intensity and the time - averaged intensity are presented in the first two rows while the last row shows the amplitude @xmath98 of the first harmonic of @xmath26 , _",
    "i.e. _ of the component of @xmath99 that oscillates at @xmath47 . in all cases , bright spots",
    "are observed near the surface that are evidence of a localized alignment of the _ fd _ viruses .",
    "more precisely , as long as the system remains far from a phase transition , the transmitted intensity field can be interpreted using the `` stress optical rule '' @xcite according to which the birefringence @xmath100 is proportional to the shear stress @xmath101 , so that @xmath102 .",
    "therefore , at least for the more dilute sample which is far from the i ",
    "n transition , the birefringence intensity should oscillate at @xmath47 and the amplitude of the first harmonic should read : @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a constant that depends on the exact geometry of the experiment , the optical set up , and the optical properties of the sample",
    ". figure  [ fig4](a ) shows that the transmitted intensity indeed oscillates at @xmath47 .",
    "moreover , for the dilute sample , @xmath105 can be predicted from the model developed above by inserting eqs .",
    "( [ eq.1 ] ) and ( [ eq.2 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq.9 ] ) .",
    "we restrain ourselves to the @xmath14-dependence of the transmitted intensity by calculating the average over @xmath12 of the temporal standard deviation of the transmitted intensity @xmath26 : @xmath106 ( where @xmath107 denotes the average over @xmath108 ) , which should be proportional to @xmath109 . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) , this approach provides a good description of @xmath110 with the constant @xmath104 as the only free parameter .",
    "also , when plotted versus @xmath111 , all curves @xmath110 measured for different vibration amplitudes collapse on the same curve .",
    "incidentally , this also proves that @xmath104 does not depend on @xmath45 .",
    "more importantly , the results shown in figs .  [ fig1](left ) and [ fig4 ] for the more dilute sample are consistent with eq .",
    "( [ eq.9 ] ) and accredit a scenario of shear - induced alignment in which the rodlike colloids simply orient periodically according to the shear - rate field generated by the surface wave pattern .    for samples close to or above the i ",
    "n transition , however , the stress optical rule breaks down as the order parameter saturates and the above approach is no longer justified . still , interesting new effects show up in fig .",
    "[ fig1](middle ) for the sample at @xmath10  mg@xmath9ml .",
    "there , it is seen that the minimum intensity is nonzero over a thin layer below the surface covering almost the whole width of the sample .",
    "this layer also corresponds to maxima in @xmath112 while it does not show in @xmath98 .",
    "this means that the surface waves have generated a _ permanent _ birefringence pattern below the surface with the same wavelength.@xmath27 in other words , just below the i ",
    "n transition , the sample keeps the imprint of the surface wave pattern . the fact that the continuous component of the transmitted intensity becomes larger for larger concentrations",
    "is also reflected in the smaller oscillations of the relative amplitude reported in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) : in the more concentrated samples , the oscillating component represents less than 5  % of the average intensity , about three times smaller than for the dilute sample .    as for the most concentrated sample at @xmath11  mg@xmath9ml ,",
    "it is easily checked from @xmath112 in fig .",
    "[ fig1](middle ) that this nematic phase presents some significant birefringence everywhere in the sample .",
    "moreover , although the effect is less spectacular than for the sample at @xmath10  mg@xmath9ml due to this natural birefringence , a continuous pattern is also generated that reflects the surface wave pattern .",
    "we interpret the build - up of a continuous birefringence field as a trade - off between rotational relaxation of the colloids and shear - induced alignment . in steady state ,",
    "the rodlike viruses align locally due to shear , but close to the i ",
    "n transition , their large relaxation time prevents them from reorienting between two oscillations so that they remain aligned . this qualitative argument , which is developed more formally below",
    ", may also explain why the hysteresis cycles of the concentrated suspensions could not be properly accounted for [ see fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) and ( c ) ] : since it takes longer for the fluid to relax after alignment , our experimental determination of the critical acceleration may not be accurate enough leading to some irreproducibility in @xmath37 .",
    "a basic understanding of the virus alignment induced by faraday waves can be obtained through numerical analysis following the calculation by dhont and briels for rigid cylindrical particles of length @xmath113 and diameter @xmath114 @xcite . in short",
    ", this approach yields the temporal evolution of the orientational order parameter tensor @xmath115 based on the shear - rate field .",
    "one result is that , in the isotropic phase ( @xmath116 ) , the linear complex viscosity @xmath117 follows the oldroyd - b model , where the characteristic variables depend on the solvent viscosity @xmath52 , the volume fraction of rodlike particles @xmath118 , their aspect ratio @xmath119 , and their rotational diffusion coefficient at infinite dilution @xmath120 , according to : @xmath121 it should be noted that the above expression is only valid in the isotropic state and that extra care should be taken in the nematic state by fitting the calculated viscosity . under this model ,",
    "the sample is isotropic for @xmath122 and nematic for @xmath123 .",
    "moreover no direct comparison can be made between rheological results from this model and experimental ones as this model neglects the flexibility of the rodlike colloids which becomes important at high frequency due to rouse modes , while at low frequency the particle diffusion is neglected  @xcite .",
    "still this calculation has proven useful to predict the alignment of rigid rods under shear  @xcite , which we investigate here .    in the limit of small amplitude ( linear approximation ) in an horizontally unbounded cell , ref .",
    "@xcite gives the numerical expression of the two - dimensional velocity field @xmath124 regime knowing the complex viscosity of the sample .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ eq_oldb ] ) , we first calculate the @xmath124 in the linear regime .",

    "close to the surface , a band is present where @xmath142 with a periodicity @xmath143 .",
    "this is a clear indication of a phase transition induced by the surface waves and is similar to the bright zones of the minimum of intensity seen in fig .",

    "are well reproduced by the numerical calculations , significant discrepancies are observed , most importantly the presence of higher order of birefringence ( @xmath144 ) resulting in a secondary maximum in the computed intensity field that is absent in the experiment .",
    "this intensity peak marks the end of higher order birefringence . at the position where this maximum occurs",

    "finally , the presence of a meniscus at the edge of the cell can damp the velocity .",
    "still , the basic calculations presented in fig .  [ fig_int_num5 ] strongly support our interpretation of the experimental observations in terms of a localized isotropic - to - nematic transition triggered by the faraday instability .",
    "the present study has unveiled a strong effect of the faraday instability on suspensions of rodlike colloidal particles . by measuring the surface height profile ,",

    "we have further provided evidence that faraday waves induce local nematic ordering of the rodlike colloids through birefringence measurements .",
