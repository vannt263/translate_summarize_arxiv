    "<S> the empirical value of the real part of the pion - deuteron scattering length can be well understood in terms of the dominant isovector @xmath0-double scattering contribution . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate in chiral perturbation theory all one - pion loop corrections to this double scattering term which in the case of @xmath1-scattering close the gap between the current - algebra prediction and the empirical value of the isovector threshold t - matrix @xmath2 . </S>",

    "<S> we evaluate the chirally corrected double scattering term and the off - shell contribution with various realistic deuteron wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the off - shell correction contributes at most -8% and that the isovector double scattering term explains at least 90% of the empirical value of the real part of the @xmath3-scattering length .    </S>",

    "<S> recently , methodology has been developed @xcite which allows one to relate scattering processes involving a single nucleon to nuclear scattering processes . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , one can relate pion - nucleon scattering to pion - deuteron scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the non - perturbative effects responsible for deuteron binding are accounted for by ( phenomenological ) deuteron wavefunctions . </S>",
    "<S> although this introduces some model dependence one can evaluate matrix elements of chiral operators in a variety of wavefunctions in order to estimate the theoretical error induced by the off - shell behavior of different nn - potentials .    in a recent precision experiment </S>",
    "<S> the psi - group has extracted the isoscalar and isovector pion - nucleon scattering lengths @xmath5 from the shift and the width of the 1s - level in pionic hydrogen , with the result @xcite : @xmath6 @xmath7 one concludes from these results that the isoscalar @xmath0-scattering length @xmath8 is compatible with zero and that the ( present ) errors of @xmath9 are anti - correlated . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of future psi - experiments is to measure the level width @xmath10 with the same precision as the level shift @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> we have converted in eqs.(1,2 ) scattering lengths into equivalent threshold t - matrices by multiplying with the appropriate kinematical factor . @xmath12mev and @xmath13mev denote the proton and charged pion mass .    in an analogous psi - experiment the complex - valued pion - deuteron scattering length @xmath14 has been extracted from the shift and the width of the 1s - level in pionic deuterium @xcite . again converted into a threshold t - matrix the ( averaged ) experimental result of refs.@xcite reads for the real part , @xmath15 where @xmath16mev denotes the deuteron mass .    because of the large size ( and weak binding ) of the deuteron it is possible to establish an accurate relationship @xcite between the real part re@xmath17 and @xmath0 threshold t - matrices @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the single scattering contribution @xmath19 is small and within present error bars compatible with zero . the empirical value of the real part re@xmath20 can be well understood in terms of the dominant isovector double scattering term @xcite which reads , @xmath21 here , @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote the conventional s- and d - state deuteron wavefunctions , normalized to @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> the relation eq.(4 ) can be easily derived from the diagrams shown in fig.1 . </S>",
    "<S> the four - momentum of the in- and out - going pion ( marked by arrows ) is @xmath25 and that of the exchanged virtual pion is @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> after fourier - transforming the product of the corresponding pion - propagator @xmath27 and the deuteron momentum - distributions into coordinate space one gets @xmath28 times the deuteron density @xmath29 . the remaining factor @xmath30 originates from the isospin factors of the diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of working with threshold t - matrices ( which are directly related to feynman diagrams ) is that there appear no additional kinematical factors in eq.(4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> other three - body interaction terms induced by @xmath31-interaction ( the in- and out - going pion couple to a virtual pion in flight ) which are formally of the same chiral order have been evaluated in refs.@xcite and they were found to be negligibly small </S>",
    "<S> . for extensive earlier works on the pion - deuteron scattering length and related issues , see refs.@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the shortcoming of the present chiral perturbation theory calculations of re@xmath20 is that the isovector double scattering contribution eq.(4 ) is ( and for reasons of consistency has to be ) evaluated with the leading order expression @xmath32fm for the isovector @xmath0 threshold t - matrix . as usual </S>",
    "<S> @xmath33mev denotes the weak pion decay constant . </S>",
    "<S> since this tomozawa - weinberg prediction @xmath34 is about 13% smaller than the empirical ( central ) value of @xmath35 ( see eq.(2 ) ) the ( leading order ) chiral isovector double scattering contribution to re@xmath36 comes out about 25% too small , as can be seen from the numbers given in table1 of ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , weinberg argued in ref.@xcite that because of its dominance the isovector double scattering contribution eq.(4 ) should be calculated including vertex corrections and he simply took the measured @xmath0-scattering length @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of the present paper is to study in the systematic framework of chiral perturbation theory the corrections to this simple substitution rule .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown in ref.@xcite that the about 13% gap between the current algebra prediction @xmath34 and the empirical value of @xmath35 is closed by chiral one - pion loop corrections at order @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> all other possible corrections from resonances etc . </S>",
    "<S> are much too small to close this gap . </S>",
    "<S> keeping only the important pion - loop correction the chiral expansion of the on - shell isovector @xmath0 threshold t - matrix reads @xcite , @xmath39 with @xmath40 a scale parameter introduced in dimensional regularization and minimal subtraction . with @xmath41gev the central empirical value of @xmath35 is reproduced . </S>",
    "<S> the scale parameter @xmath40 can also be interpreted as a momentum space cut - off @xmath42 . by comparing with the expression of relevant ( logarithmically divergent ) loop integral obtained in cut - off regularization </S>",
    "<S> one finds the relation @xmath43mev . </S>",
    "<S> this value of the cut - off @xmath42 is comparable to the usual estimate of the chiral symmetry breaking scale @xmath44mev .    in order to improve on the isovector double scattering contribution @xmath45 one </S>",
    "<S> should therefore include pion - loop corrections at the @xmath46 transition vertices . </S>",
    "<S> the grey disk in the diagrams in fig.1 symbolizes all one - loop graphs of ( isovector ) @xmath0-scattering . </S>",
    "<S> now , since the exchanged pion with four - momentum @xmath26 is off its mass - shell the loop diagrams included in the grey disk will lead for such a half off - shell kinematics to more than the order @xmath47 loop correction to @xmath35 given in eq.(5 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition there is an off - shell contribution @xmath48(off ) which turns out to be generated entirely by the two graphs shown in fig.2 involving the chiral @xmath49-vertex . </S>",
    "<S> this off - shell contribution reads explicitly , @xmath50   \\bigg [ { s \\over q } \\ln { s+ q \\over 2m_\\pi } -1 \\bigg ] \\bigg\\ } \\nonumber \\\\ & = &   { m_\\pi   \\over 2f_\\pi^2 } \\,g^v_e(-q^2 ) _ </S>",
    "<S> { loop}\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the abbreviation @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> as indicated it is proportional to the one - pion loop contribution to the isovector electric form factor of the nucleon @xmath52 ( normalized to unity at @xmath53 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that the off - shell correction @xmath48(off ) in eq.(6 ) is independent of the choice of the interpolating pion - field even though the ( off - shell ) @xmath49-vertex is not .    with inclusion of chiral pion - loop corrections to the threshold t - matrix @xmath35 </S>",
    "<S> the isovector double scattering term takes the form , @xmath54 \\int_{1/ \\lambda}^\\infty dr\\ , { \\rho(r ) \\over \\pi r } \\,,\\ ] ] which is practically equivalent to inserting the empirical value of @xmath55 into eq.(4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the off - shell correction eq.(6 ) to re@xmath56 is obtained by multiplying @xmath48(off ) with the pion - propagator @xmath57 and fourier - transforming this product into coordinate space . </S>",
    "<S> the terms in the first line of eq.(6 ) give this way a delta - function @xmath58 which exclusively probes the deuteron wavefunction at the origin . </S>",
    "<S> the fourier - transform of the other non - polynomial terms in eq.(6 ) is most conveniently obtained with the help of a dispersion relation and one finds @xmath59 \\,.\\ ] ] one observes that the weight function multiplying the deuteron density @xmath29 goes like @xmath60 for @xmath61 . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> its asymptotic behavior for @xmath62 is @xmath63 , the typical form of a @xmath4-exchange potential . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the double scattering term eq.(7 ) the off - shell correction eq.(8 ) is mainly sensitive to the short distance behavior of the deuteron wavefunction . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath60-singularity in eq.(8 ) originates from the large-@xmath64 behavior of the ( one - loop ) form factor in eq.(6 ) , which clearly is not realistic for large momentum transfers . </S>",
    "<S> we regularize the @xmath60 short distance singularity ( in a minimal way ) by starting the radial integration at a nonzero @xmath65fm , where @xmath66mev is the ( equivalent ) momentum cut - off entering the chiral logarithm in eq.(5 ) .    [ </S>",
    "<S> cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table 1 , we present numerical values of the chirally corrected double scattering contribution @xmath67 and the off - shell correction @xmath68 for various realistic deuteron wavefunctions taken from refs.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one observes that the chirally corrected isovector double scattering contribution @xmath67 is rather stable and close to the empirical value of re@xmath20 in eq.(3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> when starting the radial integration at @xmath69 instead of @xmath70fm these numbers are affected at most in the last digit . </S>",
    "<S> the off - shell correction @xmath71 which is mainly sensitive to the short distance behavior of @xmath29 varies more with the deuteron wavefunction . </S>",
    "<S> it is however always a small attractive effect whose relative magnitude does not exceed 8% .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the ( chirally corrected ) isovector double scattering term explains at least 90% of the empirical value of the real part of the @xmath3 threshold t - matrix . </S>",
    "<S> this is in agreement with the findings of ref.@xcite were a host of other small corrections to re@xmath20 has been investigated . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in ref.@xcite an off - shell correction of the form eq.(6 ) proportional to a phenomenological dipole form factor ( minus unity ) has been considered . the off - shell correction eq.(6 ) obtained in the present work </S>",
    "<S> has in fact a well - defined conceptual and physical origin . </S>",
    "<S> it is the unique byproduct of the pion - loop graphs which close the gap between the current - algebra prediction and the empirical value of the isovector @xmath0 threshold t - matrix @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> its effect on re@xmath20 is comparable to the inherent theoretical uncertainty of the isovector double scattering contribution @xmath67 . </S>"
