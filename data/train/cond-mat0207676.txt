    "the development of cooling techniques has opened up the possibility of studying ultracold gases . in particular ,",
    "the quantum degeneracy of bosons and fermions has been investigated .",
    "basically there are two different processes which can be used to cool an atomic or molecular ensemble , evaporative cooling and sympathetic cooling . however , there are gases in which the interaction is too weak for evaporative cooling to work . in addition",
    ", this method fails for identical fermions at low temperatures because of the exclusion principle  @xcite . in this case ,",
    "sympathetic cooling can be used as an alternative to evaporative cooling : a cold gas is in thermal contact with another gas to be cooled .",
    "the first application of the sympathetic cooling method was in the context of the cooling of charged particles @xcite and later it was extended to neutral atoms @xcite .",
    "only recently has it been applied in the context of ultracold atoms . in particular ,",
    "quantum degeneracy of bosons and fermions has been achieved by thermalization of atoms of the same species in different internal states @xcite , between two isotopes of the same species @xcite , and finally between atoms of different species @xcite . moreover , in contrast to evaporative cooling , sympathetic cooling does not lead to a significant loss of either the cooled gas or the cooling agent .    from the theoretical point of view ,",
    "classical and quantum models have been derived to describe the dynamics of thermalization of one - species and two - species systems . in the classical boltzmann regime ,",
    "an analytical formula for the evolution of the temperature in a mixture of non - equal mass atoms and equal mass atoms has been derived in refs.@xcite .",
    "a quantum mechanical description is given in terms of boltzmann equations @xcite and master equations @xcite .",
    "in ref.@xcite , sympathetic cooling of an atomic fermi gas by a bose gas is studied . in particular , the equilibrium temperature and the relaxation dynamics are obtained . in ref.@xcite , for the first time , a master equation describing the sympathetic cooling of a system @xmath0 is derived , treating the cooling agent @xmath1 as a heat bath at a fixed temperature .",
    "more recently , by means of decoherence and ergodicity arguments a rate equation for sympathetic cooling of harmonically trapped bosons or fermions is obtained @xcite . in refs.@xcite a detailed quantum kinetic master equation , which couples the dynamics of a trapped condensate to the vapor of noncondensate particles ,",
    "is obtained along with information about the growth of a bose - einstein condensate . in refs.@xcite",
    ", one can find more information about the growth of the condensate .",
    "the purpose of this work is to describe the sympathetic cooling process of a total - number - conserving system in terms of particles in the ground state and elementary excitations .",
    "we use the particle - number - conserving girardeau - arnowitt formalism @xcite and the sympathetic cooling model developed by m. lewenstein et al .",
    "@xcite with the additional assumption , that , the highly excited levels of the trap thermalize much faster with the cooling agent than the other levels ( or in other words , the highly excited levels of the trap are in thermal equilibrium with the cooling agent ) .",
    "the advantage of the girardeau - arnowitt formalism is that it covers all cases ranging from a total absence of population in the ground state , @xmath2 , to a highly populated ground state @xmath3 .",
    "the assumption of the fast thermalization of the highly excited levels of the trap is related to the separation of the levels of the trap into two different bands , in the same way proposed by c.w .",
    "gardiner et al . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the _ condensate _ ( @xmath4 ) band and the _ noncondensate _ band ( @xmath5 ) , where the latter is in thermal equilibrium with the cooling agent .",
    "the condensate band includes all trap levels which are directly influenced by the presence of the condensate .",
    "the noncondensate band contains energy levels that are sufficiently high for the interaction with the condensate to be negligible .",
    "as we will show , the master equation for sympathetic cooling can be written in terms of two processes : ( a ) creation and annihilation of particles in the ground state and ( b ) creation and annihilation of quasiparticles . from this master equation",
    "we derive a rate equation for this number - conserving system under sympathetic cooling which includes the growth , scattering and loss ( sympathetic evaporation ) processes .",
    "this result is very important , specially now that sympathetic cooling is used as an alternative cooling method .",
    "in addition , this rate equation is more general than the one obtained by gardiner _",
    "_ in refs.@xcite , which is only valid in the regime of a highly populated condensate @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ i ] the description of the sympathetic cooling model is given . in section [ ii ] the master equation describing the dynamics of a number - conserving system in the condensate band is derived . in subsections [ growth ] , [ scatt ] , and [ loss ] a rate equation describing the population growth , the effects of the scattered particles as well as the effects of the sympathetic evaporation ( trap losses ) is derived . section [ con ] contains the conclusion .",
    "for the sake of completeness and notation we briefly review the main results of refs .",
    "however , we introduce some modifications to the model presented in ref.@xcite : the cooling agent is a gas trapped in a harmonic potential , instead of a free gas , and the gas to be cooled is confined in an open trap . this situation is closer to the actual experimental conditions .",
    "a system @xmath0 of @xmath6 bosons is subject to sympathetic cooling due to its interaction with system @xmath1 .",
    "the cooling agent of @xmath7 atoms is in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath8 .",

    "it is assumed that the interaction @xmath37 is weak compared to @xmath38 , i.e. the thermalization of the system is solely determined by the interaction with the bath .",
    "the equation above is obtained under the the following assumptions : ( i ) markov : the correlation time for the interaction between systems @xmath0 and @xmath1 is much shorter than the cooling time , and ( ii ) rotating  wave approximation : terms rotating at multiples of the trap frequency are neglected .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that if the number @xmath7 of particles in the bath is very large , decoherence acts very quickly compared to the equilibration time and reduces the density matrix to diagonal form .",

    "in this section , a master equation describing the dynamics of the condensate band is derived . basically , we extend the formalism developed by gardiner et al .",
    "@xcite to the case of two distinct gases .",
    "the trap - levels of the system @xmath0 are grouped in two bands : the _ condensate _ band ( @xmath4 ) and the band of _ noncondensed _ particles ( @xmath5 ) , where the latter is in thermal equilibrium with the cooling agent system @xmath1 ( see figure [ fig1a ] ) .",
    "the condensate band @xmath4 includes the ground state and all excited levels in the trap which are directly influenced by the presence of the condensate .",
    "the noncondensate band @xmath5 is composed by the highly excited levels , which include also the continuum states for @xmath44 .",
    "the following assumptions are used in order to derive a master equation for the condensate band from eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) :    \\(i ) we neglect the correlations between the particles in the condensate band and the particles in the noncondensate band . therefore , we assume that the complete density matrix of the system @xmath0 can be written as a direct product between the density of the condensate band and the density of the noncondensate band , i.e. , @xmath45 . since the main interest is in the dynamics of the condensate band , the noncondensate band is eliminated from the description by tracing out the noncondensate variable , i.e. , @xmath46 .",
    "\\(ii ) the density matrix of the noncondensate band @xmath47 is considered in thermal equilibrium with the cooling agent at temperature @xmath8 .",
    "the levels of this band thermalize much faster with the cooling agent than the levels of the condensate band . due to this assumption",
    ", we will completely neglect collisions between particles of the noncondensate band and particles of the cooling agent .",
    "applying these assumptions to eq.([3 ] ) , a master equation for the condensate band can be derived ,    @xmath48    where @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the expectation value of the particle number operator for state @xmath51 , given that there are @xmath52 bosons in the ground state . since the terms with @xmath53 cancel ,",
    "this case is already excluded from the summation .",
    "the first two terms , eqs.([eq43],[eq44 ] ) , account for collisions between particles in the condensate band and in the noncondensate band , and are illustrated in fig.[fig2 ] . the loss of particles from the trap , due to their interaction with the cooling agent atoms are also included in eq.([eq44 ] ) .",
    "the existence of such a process is related to the fact that the trap is open , hence the atoms with higher energy than the trap energy can indeed escape . in the present model these particles",
    "are considered to escape to continuum states ( non - bound states ) . in this case",
    "the single - particle states are described by plane waves .",

    "( [ eq4]-[eq46 ] ) give an accurate treatment of the internal dynamics of the condensate band , describing how the condensate forms and how the particles are scattered by collisions .",
    "effects of elementary excitations of the condensate , representing the `` thermal cloud '' , do not appear explicitly , since they are hidden in the single - particle operators @xmath54 and @xmath55 for @xmath56 . in the limit of a highly condensed ground state ,",
    "i.e. @xmath57 , the effects of the condensate excitations can be totally neglected @xcite . during the process of condensate formation , however , their effects play a crucial role .    to analyse the role of elementary excitations ,",
    "we resort to a formalism of girardeau and arnowitt  @xcite , which conserves the number of particles .",
    "the method is based on the annihilation @xmath58 and creation @xmath59 operators of one particle in the ground state , defined as @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and in the phonon operators @xmath62 , @xmath63 defined as @xmath64 and @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the number operator of particles in the ground - state , @xmath22 and @xmath21 are usual annihilation and creation operators for the trap level @xmath67 .",
