    "this difference is marginally significant and we incorporate it into the overall calibration uncertainty .",
    "the irac calibration will be updated in the future to include these results and a wider sample of spectral types from the legacy science programs .",
    "we define the irac magnitude system such that an observer measures the flux density , @xmath2 , of a source from the calibrated images out of the irac pipeline , performs image - based corrections ( array - location - dependent photometric correction , pixel - phase correction , aperture correction ) , and then uses the zero - magnitude flux densities , @xmath3}$ ] , to calculate the magnitude @xmath4=2.5\\log_{10}(f_{zero}^{[i]}/f_\\nu^{quot})$ ] where @xmath5 are the four irac channels . in this system",
    ", there is no need to know the spectral shape of the source , as the magnitude is a measure of the in - band flux relative to that of vega .",
    "the zero - magnitude fluxes were determined by integrating the kurucz model spectrum of @xmath6 lyr over the passbands using the equations above ; specifically , @xmath7 } = \\frac{\\int{f_\\nu \\left(\\nu/\\nu_0\\right)^{-1 } r^{[i ] } d\\nu } }                { \\int{\\left(\\nu/\\nu_0\\right)^{-2 } r^{[i ] } d\\nu}}.\\ ] ] the resulting zero - magnitude flux densities are @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 jy in the [ 3.6 ] , [ 4.5 ] , [ 5.8 ] , and [ 8 ] @xmath0 m channels , respectively . due to the choice of a dwarfs as the absolute calibrators , this magnitude convention should yield results on the same scale as used in optical and near - infrared astronomy .",
    "all the discussion so far has been based on aperture photometry with a specified beam size and sky annulus (  [ photometrysection ] ) , and the calibration factors in table  [ newcaltab ] are defined for these parameters .",
    "the parameters were optimized for photometry of isolated , bright point sources and will not in general be suitable for other applications .",
    "in particular , some of the source flux lands in the sky annulus and is subtracted , while additional flux lands outside the sky annulus and is ignored .",
    "measurements using different beam sizes or sky annuli will need to account for these effects .",
    "therefore ,    1 .",
    "point sources extracted with the same aperture as we used for calibration will get the correct flux ( no further aperture correction needed ) ; 2 .",
    "point sources extracted with other on - source radii or sky annuli can use aperture correction tables , as long as they are normalized such that there is no correction for apertures identical to those used in our absolute calibration ; 3 .",
    "point sources extracted using point spread function fitting should verify the normalization of the point spread function would give unity flux if the on - source and sky calibration apertures are applied ( i.e. not unity flux for the integral over the entire point spread function ) ; and 4 .",
    "extended emission surface brightness will be incorrectly calibrated and will require scaling by the `` infinite '' aperture correction .",
    "the reason we have not attempted an aperture correction is that the measurements are still under way and the empirically - derived values are not well understood .",
    "part of the effect is simple diffraction and could be estimated using , for example , an airy function determined by the primary mirror size and the filter central wavelength ; this effect explains channels 1 and 2 .",
    "however , in channels 3 and 4 substantially more of the source flux is scattered out of the calibration aperture than can be explained by diffraction theory .",
    "this light is thought to be scattered within the detector material .",
    "its distribution , dependence on location of the source in the array , and the ultimate fate of the lost source flux are under investigation .",
    "the empirical determination of the aperture corrections is being described by @xcite ; at present we recommend extended emission ( including the basic calibrated data and the image mosaics from the pipeline ) be multiplied by the effective aperture correction factors of 0.944 , 0.937 , 0.772 , and 0.737 for channels 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , respectively .",
    "three further practical matters have already been mentioned but are worth summarizing here as well .    1 .",
    "the irac science pipeline generates images in units of surface brightness , but because of distortion , the pixels do not subtend constant solid angle .",
    "the irac spectral response varies over the field of view , and therefore the color corrections are field dependent .",
    "3 .   the electron rate in the 3.6 @xmath0 m channel depends slightly on pixel phase .",
    "the present calibration factors is correct on average , as is appropriate for sources observed multiple times at multiple dither positions . for the most precise photometry ,",
    "however , pixel phase should be taken into account .",
    "corrections ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are available from the spitzer science center and are described by @xcite ; they were taken into account in the present paper by using the array - location - dependent photometric corrections in table  [ delta_flat ] . correction ( 3 ) was applied using the simple equations in  [ photometrysection ] .",
    "observers should apply these corrections in a manner consistent with that applied in this paper , in order for the absolute calibration to apply .",
    "the secondary calibrator sa115_554 has a periodic light curve .",
    "it was observed every 12 hr in two campaigns , spanning a total of 26 days .",
    "the light - curve phases well to a period of 7.4 days , with an amplitude of 5% .",
    "figure  [ eclip ] shows the light curve , phased to 0 at modified julian date 52996.5 . the light curve is identical at all 4 irac wavelengths , indicating that the source of variability is not a mid - infrared - specific phenomenon but rather something with colors comparable to the star , which is classified as a k1.5iii .",
    "this star was found to be variable as part of the asas by @xcite , who found i - band variability with a period of 7.451 days , identical to the irac period .",
    "the amplitude of the i - band variation was 0.18 mag , and its light - curve is distinctly different from that measured by irac .",
    "if the variability were due to an orbiting companion , then the companion would probably be late - type and small , perhaps an m dwarf .",
    "but the observed variability likely arises from pulsations of the star itself .",
    "the optical light curve is more characteristic of a cepheid variable , and the spectral type obtained by @xcite was g7 , consistent with a cepheid , though the spectral type derived from our own work was a k1.5iii .",
    "the primary calibrator hd 165459 was found to have a significant ( @xmath12% ) excess at 24 @xmath0 m , in the mips calibration program . presumably , this excess is due to a disk around the star such as in other ` vega'-type a stars .",
    "is there any evidence for this disk at irac wavelengths ? calibrating the measured fluxes with the new calibration factors , we find the star s flux relative to the photospheric model is @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , in channels 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , respectively .",
    "since these are absolute measurements , we have used @xmath17 from table  [ newcaltab ] as the calibration uncertainty ( and combined with the uncertainty in this individual star s measurements ) .",
    "in fact , we can remove the absolute uncertainty in the size of the star by normalizing all fluxes at 3.6 @xmath0 m .",
    "then the ratio of observed flux to photospheric , assuming there is no excess at 3.6 @xmath0 m , is @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 in channels 2 , 3 , and 4 , respectively .",
    "it appears that there is no mid - infrared excess for this star in the 3.68 @xmath0 m range , at a 95% confidence upper limit of 4% ( with no assumptions ) , or at 4.5 , 5.8 , or 8 @xmath0 m , at a 95% confidence limit of 1.2 , 1.8 , or 1.6% ( assuming no excess at 3.6 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "the infrared array camera on the _ spitzer space telescope _ has a stable gain on all measured timescales , making it possible to measure variability at the 2% level for carefully - reduced data .",
    "the absolute calibration using stellar photospheric models scaled to ground - based photometry at optical through near - infrared wavelengths is accurate to 1.8% , 1.9% , 2.0% , and 2.1% in channels 1 ( 3.6 @xmath0 m ) , 2 ( 4.5 @xmath0 m ) , 3 ( 5.8 @xmath0 m ) , and 4 ( 8 @xmath0 m ) , respectively . to measure fluxes at this high level of accuracy",
    "requires several photometric corrections : array position dependence ( due to changing spectral response and pixel solid angle over the camera of view ) , pixel phase dependence ( due to nonuniform quantum efficiency over a pixel ) , color correction ( due to the different system response integrated over the passband for sources of different color ) , and aperture correction ( due to the fractions of light included within the measurement aperture and lost in the background aperture ) .",
    "this work is based on observations made with the spitzer space telescope , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology under nasa contract 1407 .",
    "support for this work was provided by nasa through an award issued by jpl / caltech .",
    "this publication makes use of data products from the two micron all sky survey , which is a joint project of the university of massachusetts and the infrared processing and analysis center / california institute of technology , funded by the national aeronautics and space administration and the national science foundation .",
    "we thank don hoard and stephanie wachter for helping us understand the nature of the variable secondary calibrator and pointing out that it might be a cepheid variable .",
