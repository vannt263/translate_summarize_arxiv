    "for many years the radiative kaon decay @xmath1 has been considered as a good tool for studying the low energy structure of qcd .",
    "the amplitude of this process consists of two parts : a long distance contribution called inner bremsstrahlung ( ib ) and a direct emission ( de ) part .",
    "ib contribution is associated with the @xmath2 decay according to low s theorem  @xcite , and de can be calculated in the framework of the chiral perturbation theory ( chpt )  @xcite . in its turn ,",
    "the de part is decomposed into electric and magnetic parts .",
    "despite the fact that the @xmath2 decay is suppressed by the @xmath3 rule , the bremsstrahlung contribution is still much larger than de .",
    "+ for the above mentioned radiative process de is the region of relatively hard photons and large angles between pion and photon . the following variables are usually adopted  @xcite : the charged pion kinetic energy in the kaon rest frame @xmath4 ; the lorentz invariant variable @xmath5 , where @xmath6 are charged pion , kaon and photon 4-momenta and @xmath7  masses of @xmath8 and @xmath9 mesons .",
    "these variables enable one to gain a distinction between de and ib contributions by means of the @xmath10-dependence of the decay width  @xcite . +",
    "as the de piece is almost two order of magnitude smaller than the bremsstrahlung  @xcite , the correct consideration of interference terms between ib and de becomes crucial .",
    "recently , the na48/2 collaboration has measured the interference of the bremsstrahlung and electric parts for @xmath11  @xcite and it has been shown that the main contribution in de comes from the magnetic part , which is more than one order of magnitude larger than the electric contribution .",
    "+ at present the na48/2 collaboration at cern sps is analyzing the experimental data on the radiative decay with a virtual photon that has not been observed up to now : k^(p_k)^^0^*(q)^(p_1)^0(p_2 ) e^+(k_1)e^-(k_2 ) .",
    "[ mainpr ] the advantage of this decay in comparison with the radiative decay with a real photon for the de component extraction is obvious : the photon virtuality ( @xmath12 ) allows one to analyze the additional kinematical        region which is absent in the case of real photons .",
    "+ the solid theoretical base for this decay was developed in  @xcite , where the de contribution was calculated up to the next - to - leading order ( up to @xmath13 ) in chpt .",
    "+ the essential step has been done recently  @xcite .",
    "the authors have rewritten the matrix element and phase space in terms of five independent variables relevant to the decay with a real photon and have investigated the ib and de contributions in different kinematical regions . + keeping in mind the importance of the correct theoretical description of the decay ( 1 ) and the necessity of taking into account all possible effects in view of relative smallness of the de contribution , we have slightly revised the theoretical approach  @xcite to the @xmath14 decay , recalculating the decay width by using the cabibbo - maksimovicz variables  @xcite . + as the next step , we have obtained the expression for the differential decay width of @xmath0 in the center - of - mass system ( c.m.s ) of the lepton pair .",
    "such approach simplifies the calculations and makes the exploration of the rare process ( [ mainpr ] ) more obvious . applying the obtained formulae",
    ", we calculate the contribution of ib and de to the differential decay rate as a function of the virtual photon mass @xmath12 and dipion mass @xmath15 . as a result",
    "we have performed a comparison between the two approaches in different frames of the @xmath0 decay .",
    "the invariant amplitude of the decay ( [ mainpr ] ) can be parameterized as a product of leptonic and hadronic currents due to the covariance : a = j^(k_1,k_2)j_(p_1,p_2,q ) where @xmath16 are the 4-momenta of charged and neutral pions , @xmath17  the leptons 4-momenta and @xmath18 is the momentum of the virtual photon .",
    "the leptonic current is : j^(k_1,k_2)=|u(k_2)^v(k_1 ) , whereas the hadronic current is represented in terms of two electric form factors @xmath19 and the magnetic one @xmath20 : j_(p_1,p_2,q)=f_1p_1+f_2p_2+f_3^p_1p_2q _ .",
