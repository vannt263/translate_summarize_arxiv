    "<S> = 1            spin - polarized scanning tunneling microscopy ( sp - stm ) is a powerful technique for real - space imaging of atomic - scale spin features .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite its implementation , starting from a conventional scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) setup , requires careful preparation of ( 1 ) a tip with a well - defined magnetic termination and ( 2 ) a test sample with nanoscale magnetic structure .    tips for sp - stm have been fabricated using bulk ferromagnetic ( fm )  @xcite or antiferromagnetic ( af )  @xcite materials , or by evaporating a thin magnetic film on a nonmagnetic tip .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite while fm tips afford larger spin contrast , af tips produce negligible stray fields and are better suited for nondestructive imaging . </S>",
    "<S> af tips etched from bulk cr are one emerging candidate for sp - stm , ideal for their monatomic composition and high nel temperature of 311 k. they typically exhibit a canted tip magnetization which is rotatable in a 2 t field ,  @xcite sensitive to all 3d spatial components ,  @xcite and capable of atomic - resolution imaging .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite however , the extent to which the electrochemical preparation influences these characteristics is poorly understood . </S>",
    "<S> systematic studies have been mostly limited to nonmagnetic w tips .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    a major practical advantage of bulk cr tips is that they circumvent the need for complex ultra - high vacuum ( uhv ) cleaning and evaporation procedures , as well as _ in - situ _ tip exchange .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite however , the test magnetic systems commonly used ( e.g. cr(001 ) ,  @xcite fe / w(110 ) ,  @xcite co / cu(111 )  @xcite ) still involve extensive surface preparation in a uhv environment . </S>",
    "<S> it is natural to ask whether a similar simplification can be achieved by selecting a cleavable material with an appropriate magnetic landscape for spin - polarized imaging .    here </S>",
    "<S> , we report a study of the sp - stm technique in two directions . </S>",
    "<S> first , we examine how _ ex - situ _ fabrication parameters affect cr tip apex geometry , which in turn influences both atomic- and spin - resolution imaging . </S>",
    "<S> we etch over 70 cr rods under various voltage magnitudes and sequences , and image the tips formed on both ends of the break junction using a scanning electron microscope ( sem ) . </S>",
    "<S> second , we evaluate the tunneling characteristics of our tips using cleaved crystal planes as opposed to thin films . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate spin - polarized tunneling over antiferromagnetic terraces of the bilayer manganite la@xmath0sr@xmath1mn@xmath2o@xmath3 , and also resolve single atoms in the cuprate bi@xmath2sr@xmath2cacu@xmath2o@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> these results provide a feasible approach for stm setups with  _ in - situ _ cleavers to perform spin - polarized tunneling measurements .    </S>",
    "<S> we etch tips from square 0.5 mm @xmath5 0.5 mm polycrystalline cr rods ( 99.99@xmath6 purity )   using the standard direct current ( dc ) drop - off method .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite a photograph of our setup is given in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a ) ( see supplementary material for further details ) . </S>",
    "<S> one end of the rod is covered with a 7 mm polytetrafluoroethylene ( ptfe ) tubing  @xcite and immersed in a 5 m naoh electrolyte , along with an inert ta anode . </S>",
    "<S> the level of the solution relative to the cr rod is gradually raised until the instant the meniscus surpasses the ptfe tubing and re - forms around the rod , so as to confine the etching activity to a small region above the ptfe tubing ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure minimizes the macroscopic tip aspect ratio , in order to improve mechanical stability . </S>",
    "<S> next , we apply a dc voltage to drive the cathodic dissolution of cr , eventually into cro@xmath7@xmath8 . a 91 @xmath9 resistor placed in series with the circuit stabilizes the etch speed . </S>",
    "<S> the exposed portion of the rod is thinned until the weight below exceeds the tensile force and breaks off , leaving behind a work - hardened tip on both ends of the break . </S>",
    "<S> the voltage is immediately shut off and both the remnant tip above the break ( called top ) and below the break ( called bottom ) are rinsed in deionized water and retained for subsequent examination . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig2](c ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> our results are robust across different definitions of ar with varying lengths from the tip end . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig2](e ) displays the average tip apex ar for etch voltages of 7 v , 11 v and 15 v , binned by top and bottom tips . </S>",
    "<S> previous studies of other tip materials have suggested the bottom tips to be sharper ( more favorable ) , because unlike their top counterparts , they are instantaneously disconnected at the break and do not sustain residual etching in the few seconds before the voltage is manually shut off .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite here , we demonstrate quantitatively that for cr as well , the bottom tip ars are statistically higher than those of the top tip . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the average ars are largely uncorrelated with the etch voltage or sequence . </S>",
    "<S> no improvements are detected with a two - step process , whereby the voltage is reduced from 9 v to 3 v after a fixed time period ( right end of axis break in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](e ) ) .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in fact , the two - step process , with its longer etch time typically exceeding 30 minutes , is likely more susceptible to external perturbations ( e.g. vibrations or solution evaporation ) , resulting in larger ar variability and unclear distinction between top and bottom tips . in the one - step processes </S>",
    "<S> , we also find the average rc of the bottom tips to be smaller than that of the top tips , but the trend is smaller and lacks the statistical significance of that of the ar .    </S>",

    "<S> the increased weight yields greater variability in the bottom tip ar despite an average 23@xmath6 faster etch time , possibly because the larger weight induces an earlier and more uncontrolled break .    to further understand the role of the etch voltage , </S>",

    "<S> prior to use for stm imaging , the cr tips are cleaned by field emission onto a cr or au foil within the stm . </S>",
    "<S> typically , we bring the tip into constant - current feedback with a setpoint of 50 - 100 v and 0.5 - 3 @xmath10a for several minutes . </S>",
    "<S> this removes any oxides and restructures the terminal atoms on the tip apex , which allows atomic - resolution tunneling regardless of the post - etch rc . </S>",
