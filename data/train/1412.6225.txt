    "in eukaryotic cells , the nucleus is a well recognizable organelle , which plays the role of maintaining the genome physically separated from the rest of the cell . inside the nucleus",
    ", the genome is organized into single bodies , the chromosomes , and each chromosome is constituted of a variably - long linear filament of dna and protein complexes , known as the chromatin fiber  @xcite . in human cells , the nucleus is approximately @xmath0 micron wide and the length of a chromatin filament associated to a single chromosome is of the order of @xmath1 millimeter , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath2 times longer .",
    "hence , chromatin fibers form an intricated polymer - like network inside the nucleus of the cell  @xcite . in spite of this `` intricacy ''",
    "though , macromolecular complexes and enzymes which need to run and bind to specific target sequences along the genome are relatively mobile inside the nucleus  @xcite .    in order to study quantitatively the dynamic properties of macromolecular compounds inside the chromatin mesh , passive microrheology has been recently introduced  @xcite .",
    "artificially - designed beads of sub - micron size are carefully injected inside the nucleus , and their thermally - driven brownian motion is tracked by fluorescence microscopy . from the analysis of the microscopic passive dynamics of the beads inside the nuclear medium , it is then possible  @xcite to extract quantitative information on the viscoelastic properties of the medium .    compared to standard rheology",
    ", microrheology offers several advantages . specifically , because of the feasibility to design trackable particles of sizes ranging from a few nanometers  @xcite to hundreds of nanometers  @xcite and microns  @xcite microrheology can probe very efficiently a remarkably wide range of length- and time - scales .",
    "this offers an unprecedented possibility to address specific questions in complex materials which can not be answered by traditional bulk rheology .",
    "nowadays , micro - rheology is extensively used to study biological materials because it offers methods which , being minimally invasive , can be used to perform experiments _ in vivo _ by employing very small samples  @xcite .    in this work , and along the lines of previous computational investigations aiming at measuring the viscoelastic properties of polymer solutions and melts  @xcite , we have employed molecular dynamics computer simulations in order to study the diffusive behavior of ( sub-)micron sized , _",
    "non - sticky _ particles probing the rheological properties of a coarse - grained polymer model of interphase chromosomes  @xcite .",
    "our approach complements and extends in many different ways the above - mentioned experimental work .",
    "first , passive _ non - sticky _ particles undergoing simple brownian motion represent the simplest minimally - invasive tools whose microscopic dynamics can be directly linked to the viscoelastic properties of the surrounding medium .",
    "contrarily , if particles become sticky or they become actively driven as a consequence of some cellular process , the corresponding link to the viscoelastic properties of the medium is much less transparent and more interpretative tools are needed  @xcite .",
    "second , by our computational approach we are able to single out the nominal contribution of chromatin fibers to the whole nuclear viscoelasticity .",
    "we believe this also to be an important point , as the viscoelastic response obtained through wet - lab experiments likely originates from the unavoidable coupling of chromatin fibers with any other organelle present in the nucleus .",
    "third , while the sizes of probing particles available in experiments appear to be limited  @xcite , here we monitor systematically quite an extensive range of spatial scales , from the nominal chromatin thickness up to just above the mesh ( entanglement ) size of the chromatin solution .",
    "in qualitative agreement with recent findings from a computational study on entangled polymer melts  @xcite , we found that the diffusive behavior of probe particles as a function of particle size deviates from the traditional stokes - einstein picture .",
    "our results can be well understood instead in terms of a recently proposed  @xcite scaling theory of diffusion of non - sticky particles in polymer solutions .",
    "we demonstrated further , that large particles at short time scales are temporary `` caged '' by chromatin spatial constraints , and remain confined to domains whose size match remarkably well recent experimental results for micro - tracers inside interphase nuclei .",
    "finally , we calculated the elastic and viscous moduli of interphase chromosomes and found that , in the available frequency range , they are more liquid- than solid - like .    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .  [ sec : fibermodel ] , we describe the technical details of the chromosome polymer model , and the theoretical framework to study the visco - elastic properties of chromatin solution . in sec .",

    "[ sec : discconcls ] ) with a brief discussion and possible perspectives about future work .",
    "in this work , the monomers used in the coarse representation of the chromatin fiber building the model chromosome and the non - sticky micro - probes were modeled as spherical particles , interacting through the following force field .",
    "the intra - polymer interaction energy is the same as the one used in our previous works on the modeling of interphase chromosomes  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : diffcoeffviscosity_vs_diam ] . of remarkable interest is the dynamic behaviour at times shorter than the entanglement time , @xmath44 , in particular for big particles .",

    "we stress nonetheless , that here we _",
    "reinterpret _ the experimentally observed caging as simply being the consequence of the formation of entanglements in the chromatin fiber , _",
    "i.e. _ as a genuine polymer effect  @xcite .",
    "we compare then our predictions for the storage , @xmath49 , and loss , @xmath50 , moduli to corresponding results for fibroblasts and hela cells . for micro - tracers of @xmath51m - diameter in fibroblasts ,",

    "@xcite found that the nuclear medium responds elastically in the range @xmath52 $ ] hz with a plateau modulus @xmath53 pa and @xmath50 in the range @xmath54 $ ] pa . this contrasts with our findings in several respects : our predicted environment is in general much softer ( see table  [ tab : gonegtwovalues ] ) , and we do not observe any plateau , for our simulated medium results more liquid - like than solid - like . on the other hand , the work by hameed _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite on hela cells explored by @xmath55m - sized particles suggests a much softer nuclear environment with @xmath56 at @xmath57 hz .",
    "while still suggesting a nucleus which is more solid- than liquid - like , these results are _ quantitatively _ closer to ours , although they were obtained with a quite larger tracer bead than the ones used in our simulations .    quantitative differences between these two experiments can be due to the different cell lines used , while differences between experiments and theory might be due to the simplicity of the polymer model .",
    "in particular , we would like to stress two important points which were neglected in our study .",
    "first , a conspicuous number of experimental observations  @xcite demonstrated that chromatin loci far along the sequence frequently interact with each other because of the presence of specific protein bridges . from a polymer physics perspective , this creates effective chromatin - chromatin cross - links .",
    "it was suggested  @xcite that permanent cross - links in polymer solutions and melts might alter significantly the diffusive behavior of micro - particles when their size becomes comparable to the polymer mesh size .",
    "therefore , as a possible avenue for further investigations , it would be interesting to clarify to which extent cross - links added to the system would alter the viscoelastic behaviour reported here for non cross - linked chromatin fibers .",
    "second , recent experimental studies  @xcite demonstrated that chromosomal activity and chromosomal loci dynamics is the result of a subtle interplay between _ passive _ thermal diffusion and _ active _ , atp - dependent motion triggered by chromatin remodeling and transcription complexes .",
    "the mentioned work by hameed _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that the persistent , caged behavior of the micro - tracers can be altered by imposing an external force on the tracers above a certain threshold which stimulates frequent jumps between the cages . remarkably , these jumps become almost suppressed after atp - depletion .",
    "this observation seems then to point to the important role played by active mechanisms during micro - tracers dynamics .",
    "later on in the paper , these mechanisms were ascribed to dynamic remodeling of the chromatin fiber  @xcite .",
    "consistent with that , weber _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that diffusion of chromosomal loci in bacteria and yeast is also atp - dependent .",
    "taken together , these results suggest that a picture where chromatin fibers are modeled as just as passive polymer filaments is necessarily an approximation . to move beyond this approximation , recently ganai _ et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a novel computational approach where chromosomes were modeled as chains of beads which were let evolving by a langevin equation with a non - uniform , monomer - dependent temperature linking  at a phenomenological level ",
    "monomer gene content to `` out - of - equilibrium '' activity : gene - rich monomers are `` hot / active '' while gene - poor monomers are `` cold / passive '' .",
    "interestingly , the work comes to the conclusion that quantitative understanding of the observed chromosomal arrangement inside the nucleus by purely passive mechanisms is incomplete , namely active mechanisms are also needed . for all these reasons , it would be also interesting to explore in the near future to which extent the viscoelastic properties of active - driven chromatin fibers deviate from the theoretical predictions presented in this work .",
