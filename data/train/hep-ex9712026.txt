    "the kaonic enigma @xcite,@xcite began in 1947 with their very discovery in p - n interactions such as @xmath25 .",
    "the long lifetime @xmath26 , and the fact they were always produced in pairs , was explained by postulating a new quantum number _ strangeness _ conserved by strong interactions ( production ) but not weak interactions ( decay ) ( tab.[tabkaons ] ) .    0.1 in    .",

    "@xmath30 and @xmath31 have same quantum numbers except s , which is not conserved in weak interactions ; therefore , they have common virtual decay channels and they can oscillate when decaying : state has @xmath32 when in the l=0 state , with the l=1 state being depressed by centrifugal potential . ]",

    "the suppressed nature of neutral - current decays such as @xmath47 was explained through gim - like box - diagrams and predicted a fourth flavour - _ charm _ - with mass @xmath48 .",
    "together with cpv from mixing , there can be a _",
    "@xmath49 transition from @xmath50 to @xmath51 , without @xmath52 intermediate transition .",
    "direct cpv is parametrized by @xmath53    the issue of cpv is a most fundamental one . as first emphasized by sakharov in 1967 ,",
    "the predominant asymmetry of baryons versus antibaryons in the universe could be explained by three requirements : baryon number non - conservation , a cpv baryon - creating process , with baryons out of the thermal equilibrium .",
    "see m.  gleiser s talk at this symposium @xcite .",
    "models proposed so far can be schematically distinguished in two classes , milliweak and superweak .",
    "milliweak models advocate that a tiny @xmath54 fraction of the weak interaction is indeed cpv at leading order @xmath49 .",
    "they imply t violation to guarantee the cpt theorem , and they can explain both direct [ one @xmath49 transition ] and indirect [ two @xmath49 transitions ] .",
    "superweak models ( wolfenstein , 1964 ) , on the other hand , postulate a new @xmath55 , cpv process which transforms @xmath56 .",
    "the strength of this interaction relative to weak coupling is only @xmath57 , since @xmath58 and , therefore , no direct cpv is predicted nor allowed , no cpv is expected in other systems .",
    "the standard model ( sm ) , a milliweak - type theory , _ naturally _ allows for cpv : the angle @xmath59 in the ckm matrix allows for cpv transitions @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62    the indirect cpv parameter @xmath44 is proportional in the sm picture to @xmath45 box diagrams ( fig.[diagrams]a ) @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , @xmath44 is small per se because of the suppression of interfamily transitions , while the cpv angle @xmath59 is not necessarily small .",
    "experimentally , @xmath64    the direct cpv parameter @xmath65 , on the other hand , is proportional in the sm picture to @xmath66 _ penguin _ diagrams ( fig.[diagrams]b ) which are difficult to compute , and suppressed by both the @xmath67 and the zweig rule .",

    "calculations@xcite have shown how in the sm picture direct cpv is a decreasing function of the quark masses in the penguin loop , primarily the top quark mass .",

    "one can try and use the precise measurement of @xmath70 to set bounds on @xmath59 , although along with the use of the experimental values from the @xmath71 mixing and the ratio of ckm elements @xmath72 , obtaining @xcite the qualitative picture in fig.[constraints ] .    finally , the most precise measurements and @xmath73 .",

    "the kloe experiment was proposed in april 1992 ; approved and funded at the beginning of 1993 , construction of the detector began in 1994 .",
    "the principal aim of kloe is the detection of direct cp violation in @xmath30 decays with a @xmath80 sensitivity on @xmath82 . for a comprehensive review",
    "see @xcite and references therein , while an up - to - date status report can be found in @xcite .",
    "the measurement in kloe of @xmath82 with the required precision takes advantage of unique features of a @xmath1-factory : numerous kinematical constraints exist , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are detected at the same time , clean environment typical of machines with respect to experiments at extracted hadron beams , built - in calibration processes .",
    "on the down side , the @xmath83 and @xmath84 are detected with different topologies in both the charged and the neutral decay modes .",

    "the interference term in the decay intensities above gives measurements of all sixteen parameters describing cp and cpt ( if any ) violations in the neutral kaon system @xcite .",
    "as instance , when @xmath93 , one measures @xmath94 and @xmath95 ; when @xmath96 , @xmath97 , one measures @xmath82 at large @xmath98 , and @xmath99 near @xmath100 .",
    "other physics topics include rare @xmath101 decays ( @xmath102 kaons per year will improve the sensitivity to branching ratios down to the @xmath103 range ) , tests of chiral perturbation theories , radiative   decays , and @xmath104 physics @xcite . out of such a physics spectrum other than cpv , it should be underlined the importance of a study of the @xmath105 @xmath106 meson state , produced via the @xmath1 radiative decay with a branching ratio at least @xmath107 .",
    "the nature of the lightest scalar is still unclear , whether a @xmath108 molecule , an exotic @xmath109 or a glue - ball state .",
    "the decay @xmath110 should be easily measured even at low luminosity during the machine commissioning @xcite , while the charged channel @xmath111 suffers by backgrounds from continuum .    to reach the design sensitivity on the measurement of @xmath82 via the classical double - ratio method ( eq.[eq : doubleratio ] ) , a one - year statistics at full luminosity is necessary .",
    "it is also necessary to control the detector efficiency for the decays of interest and to reject backgrounds from the copious @xmath112 decays to states other than two - pion .    the kloe detector @xcite ( fig.[klomerida96 ] ) is a hermetic , 4@xmath113 geometry apparatus : a cylindrical structure surrounding the beam pipe and consisting of a large drift chamber , and an electromagnetic calorimeter with state - of - the - art energy and time resolution @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , and a 6  kg superconducting magnet .",
    "counting of the four @xmath114 decays used in the double - ratio formula ( eq.[eq : doubleratio ] ) is performed by defining a @xmath83 fiducial volume ( 10  cm radius around the interaction point , about 17 lifetimes ) , and a @xmath84 fiducial volume ( 145  cm , about one half lifetime ) .",
    "it is very important to avoid systematical errors in the determination of the boundaries of the fiducial volumes for neutral and charged decay channels .",
    "this is accomplished by using @xmath84 decays where both the neutral and the charged vertex are measured , as in @xmath115 .",
    "the kloe calorimeter will reconstruct the @xmath116 mode , determine the decay vertex space location , reject the @xmath117 decay , and provide @xmath118 rejection .",

    "the measurement of the time of arrival @xmath123 and the impact point @xmath124 at the calorimeter of one photon out of four , and the knowledge of the @xmath83 flight direction @xmath125 , gives the @xmath84 decay length @xmath126 to an accuracy of 1  cm via the formulae @xmath127 @xmath128 where @xmath129 .",
    "a he - based , very transparent , drift chamber will reconstruct the @xmath111 final state , reject the @xmath130 background , and determine the @xmath101 flight direction and the charged decay vertices .",
    "the kloe drift chamber has space resolution @xmath131 and @xmath132 , and a 0.5% relative resolution on the transverse momentum .    to achieve the required statistical sensitivity",
    ", the entire   event rate ( 5  khz ) has to be written on tape .",
    "the calorimeter will provide triggering for most of the decay channels of interest .",
    "the rejection of three neutral - pion decays relies on the calorimeter s hermiticity and efficiency for photons down to 20  mev energy .",
    "the rejection of the @xmath133 decay over the @xmath111 decay of interest is based on several kinematical variables and constraints .",
    "the high - resolution features of the tracking limits the residual contamination to @xmath134 , at a 6  kg solenoidal field , with a 99.8% @xmath111 efficiency .",
    "kloe expects to be operational at beginning of 1998 @xcite .",
    "nuclear physics topics will be investigated by the finuda ( standing for _ fisica nucleare a da@xmath135ne _ ) experiment .",
    "a nuclear physics experiment carried out at an collider sounds contradictory in itself , but this is where the uniqueness of the idea lies @xcite : charged kaons from   decays are used as a monochromatic , slow ( 127  mev / c ) , tagged , background - free , high - counting rate beam on a thin target surrounding the beam pipe .",
    "the possibility of stopping low - momentum monochromatic @xmath136 with a thin target ( typically @xmath137 of @xmath138 ) is unique to : @xmath136 s can be stopped with minimal straggling very near the target surface , so that outgoing prompt pions do not cross any significant amount of the target and do not undergo any momentum degradation .",
    "this feature provides unprecedented momentum resolution as long as very transparent detectors are employed before and after the target .",
    "the finuda detector is optimized to perform high - resolution studies of hypernucleus production and non - mesonic decays@xcite , by means of a spectrometer with the large acceptance typical of collider experiments .",
    "negative kaons stopping inside the target produce a @xmath139-hypernucleus @xmath140 via the process @xmath141 where the momentum of the outgoing @xmath142 is directly related to the level of the hypernucleus formed ( two - body reaction ) . in the case of @xmath143 hypernucleus formation , the following weak - interaction decays are strongly favored in medium - heavy nuclei @xmath144 with the nucleus undergoing the reactions @xmath145 which are interesting for studying the validity of the @xmath67 rule @xcite .",
    "hypernuclei are a unique playground for both nuclear and particle physics @xcite .",
    "a @xmath143 embedded in a nucleus can occupy , because of the strangeness content , levels forbidden to a @xmath146 and a @xmath147 by the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath148 assignment makes the @xmath149 interaction much weaker than the ordinary @xmath150 interaction . in the shell model of nuclei",
    "the quarks are confined in bags inside baryons .",
    "baryons inside nuclei maintain their identity and interact by the exchange of mesons . at short distance",
    "the bags can fuse , quarks can get deconfined and begin interacting by exchanging gluons . for a @xmath151 hypernucleus",
    "the two models give different predictions : while in the baryon model the @xmath143 occupies the @xmath152 orbital due to its strangeness quantum number , in the quark model the @xmath153 and @xmath154 quarks inside the @xmath143 can not stay in the @xmath152 but are obliged to move to the @xmath155 orbital by pauli blocking . as a result , different binding energies are predicted by the models .    besides studies on hypernucleus spectroscopy",
    ", interest exists for k - n interactions at low energy @xcite .",
    "recently , the possibility of improving the precision on the @xmath156 branching ratio by a factor of 3 over the present world average was also discussed @xcite .",
    "finuda @xcite is a magnetic spectrometer with cylindrical geometry , optimized in order to have large solid - angle acceptance , optimal momentum resolution ( of the order of @xmath157 fwhm on prompt pions ) and good triggering capabilities .",
    "the geometrical acceptance is 100% in the @xmath1 angle ( which reduces to 80% due to dead material ) , and approximately @xmath158 , thus naturally rejecting background from bhabha scattering .",
    "finuda consists of ( fig.[detec ] ) an interaction / target region , external tracker , outer scintillator array , and superconducting solenoid .",
    "the ( @xmath159 ) pairs from   decay emerge from the interaction region ( fig.[detec ] ) , and are identified for triggering by exploiting the back - to - back event topology and by identification through in the tofino triggering scintillator array . before impinging on the target , a si-@xmath160strip array measure the ( @xmath159 ) coordinates before the nuclear target with @xmath161 and provides particle identification by .",
    "the monochromatic @xmath136 is stopped inside the thin target , reaction products are emitted isotropically : the momentum of the prompt pion is proportional to the energy of the hypernuclear level formed , and it is measured by si-@xmath160strip , low - mass drift chambers@xcite , and straw tube arrays @xcite .",
    "the signal in the outer scintillator array ( tofone ) provides a fast trigger logic coincidence .",
    "baryons or mesons from @xmath143 decays are also tracked in the spectrometer ( protons , @xmath162 ) or detected in the tofone ( neutrons ) . the expected fwhm resolution on the 270 mev / c prompt pion is 0.25% for forward pions",
    "( i.e. , those emitted towards the outer region of the spectrometer ) , which corresponds to a 0.7  mev resolution on the hypernuclear level , to be compared to the best result achieved so far at fixed - target of about 2  mev @xcite .",
    "the rate of reconstructed hypernuclear events with resolution better than 1  mev at @xmath163 is given by the expression : @xmath164 where @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 is the capture rate , @xmath168 is the total efficiency for forward ( high - resolution ) prompt pions , and @xmath169 is the chamber transparency .    superior momentum resolution , high statistics , and low background , make finuda capable of resolving hypernuclear states produced at a relative rate of order @xmath170 as simulated in fig.[finpeaks ] ( from ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the finuda experiment expects to be operational by beginning of 1998 .",
    "the dear experiment @xcite @xcite will measure the @xmath0 scattering lengths by studying the shift and the width of the energy levels of kaonic hydrogen and kaonic deuterium atoms , i.e. atoms in which a @xmath136 from the @xmath1 decay replaces the orbital electron in a hydrogen , or deuterium , target .",
    "the negative kaon then cascades , initially through auger transitions , and finally through emission of x - rays , whose energy is measured by an array of charge - coupled devices ( fig.[deamerida96 ] ) .    the strong interaction between the captured @xmath136 and the target nucleus shift the energy level of the lowest - lying atomic orbital from their purely em level .",
    "furthermore , the absorption process reduces the state lifetime , thus broadening the width of the x - ray transition .    in the case of kaonic hydrogen ,",
    "the scattering length @xmath171 is computed from the shift @xmath172 of the ground level from its computed em value , and the measured width @xmath173 of the x - ray line , via the deser formula @xmath174 where @xmath175 , @xmath176 is the strong - interaction fine - structure constant , and @xmath160 the reduced mass .",
    "the ( unshifted ) em energy levels are computed with a precision of about 1  ev , while the experimental systematics in the detector is at the level of a few ev s .",
    "experiments performed in the past are mutually inconsistent and disagree with the analysis of low - energy scattering data , whilst recent results from kek @xcite do confirm the extrapolation at threshold of scattering results ( fig.[dearcomparison ] ) .",
    "a detailed simulation of signal and backgrounds , based on a version of the geant3 code upgraded to treat photon energies down to 1  kev @xcite , shows that both machine and physical background can be kept under control ( fig.[dearpeaks ] ) with the dear setup : the prominent @xmath177 peak shown ( about 10,000 events ) can be accumulated with an integrated luminosity of about @xmath178 ( ref.@xcite ) .",
    "superior energy resolution , and lesser background with respect to the kek experiment , will dramatically reduce the error on the measurements of both shift and width of the @xmath177 line in kaonic hydrogen , whilst the kaonic deuterium will be measured for the first time ( fig.[dearcomparison ] ) .",
    "in addition to the precise determination of low - energy parameters , it has been recently pointed out @xcite how dear is able to determine with good precision the so - called kn sigma term @xmath179 .",
    "the sigma - term is a quantity which gives indication of the chiral - simmetry breaking terms in the strong hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the theoretical evaluation of the sigma - term requires that the limit of zero - mass pseudoscalar mesons is taken , and therefore approximations are required in order to use experimental data obtained from physical particle processes @xcite , @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies suggest that @xmath180 terms be much more sensitive to the @xmath181 content of the nucleon than the pionic @xmath182 terms@xcite ..    the dear collaboration ( a total of 12 institutes from 6 countries ) will take data as soon as the first stable beams circulate in the rings .",
