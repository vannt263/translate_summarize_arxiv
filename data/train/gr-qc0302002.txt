    "since the thirties , many cosmologists have been suggested  theories that predict the variation of newton s gravitational  constant  .  among the more famous are dirac s large number hypothesis @xcite , the brans - dicke theory @xcite and more recently , some model of scalar - tensor theories ( see the work by barrow @xcite . for a review ) .",
    "the last one can be seen as a generalization of brans - dicke theory .    on the experimental hand ,",
    "some measurements are performed to study this variation ; for instance , the spacecraft radar ranging @xcite and lunar laser ranging @xcite .",
    "both experiments give an upper limit for the ratio @xmath1 @xmath2that is :    @xmath3    on despite of  so especulative ideas , i have seen few numerical analisys about the evolution of the value newton s gravitational constant .",
    "a work by bronikov , melnikov and novello @xcite is in this sense .",
    "they describe the upper limit to @xmath4 barrow and parsons @xcite studied the behavior of cosmological models with varying @xmath5 .they describe some analytical solutions to the field equations , using the conformal time coordinates and showed the dependence of the coupling constant @xmath6 with @xmath7 in some particular cases of the models .    in the present work , we made a numerical analisys , based in a scalar - tensor theory , with variable @xmath8studied by barrow and others @xcite .",
    "these numerical analisys , togheter with experimental data , could indicate the more correct theory , the initial conditions of the universe and the evolution.the paper is divided in the following sequence : in next section , we review the model and isolated some variables that will be important in the sequence . in section 3 , we show the numerical methods and hypotheses . in section 4",
    "we show some graphics , the main point of this work .",
    "the last section is devoted to discussion and concluion .",
    "newtonian gravitation permits us to ",
    "write in an explicit time variation of g without the need to satisfy any further constraint . however , in general relativity the geometrical structure of space - time is determined by the sources of mass - energy it contains and so there are further constraints to be satisfied .",
    "suppose that we take einstein s equation in the form  ( c@xmath9 )    @xmath10    where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the einstein and energy - momentum tensors , as usual , but imagine that @xmath13  if we take a covariant divergence @xmath14 of this equation the left - hand  vanishes because of the bianchi identities , @xmath15 if energy - momentum conservation is assumed to hold , hence @xmath16 always . in order to introduce a time- variation  of @xmath5",
    "we need  to derive  the space and time variations from some scalar  field , @xmath17 which contributes a stress tensor @xmath18 to the right = hand side of the gravitational field equations .",
    "we can express this structure by a choice of lagrangian , linear in the curvatura scalar @xmath19 , that generaizes the einstein - hilbert lagrangian of general relativity with ,    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the lagrangian of matter fields .",
    "the choice of function @xmath22 defines the theory .",
    "when @xmath17 is constant this reduces , after rescaling  of coordinates , to the einstein - hilbert lagrangian of general relativity .",
    "the formulation introduced by brans - dicke @xcite can be obtained from [ f1 ] by a non - linear tranformation of @xmath17 and @xmath23 define a new scalar field @xmath24 , and a new coupling constant @xmath25 by    @xmath26{0xb4}}% % beginexpansion { \\acute{}}% % endexpansion % tcimacro{\\unicode[m]{0xb4}}% % beginexpansion { \\acute{}}% % endexpansion ^{2 } ) \\end{array } \\label{f2}\\ ] ]    then [ f1 ] becames    @xmath27    the brans - dicke theory arises as the special case    @xmath28    the field equations that arise by varying the action associated with @xmath29 in [ f3 ] with respect to the metric , @xmath30and @xmath24 separately , gives the field equations ,    @xmath31 -\\phi ^{-1}\\left [ \\phi _ { , a;b}-g_{ab}\\square \\phi \\right ]   \\label{f5}\\ ] ]    @xmath32 \\square \\phi = 8\\pi t_{a}^{a}-\\omega ^{\\prime } ( \\phi ) \\phi _ { , i}\\phi ^{^{\\prime } i }   \\label{f6}\\ ] ]    where  the energy - momentum tensor of the matter sources obeys the conservation equation    @xmath33    these field equations reduce to those of general relativity when @xmath24 ( and hence @xmath34 ) is constant , in which case the newtonian gravitational constant is defined by @xmath35 .      in this work work",
    ", we will not suppose any trial function @xmath36 hence we will not propose any analitycal solution to the field equation ; instead we calculated @xmath37 , numerically , based in initial values of @xmath38 and of course @xmath34 ( given by the field equations ) . we suppose that the scalar tensor theory can describe the present universe quite well , so we have to consider the recent experimental  data about it .",
    "we also assume that these data are hold , at least , during the last one billion of years .    clearly",
    "the equation of state of our work must be :    @xmath39    that is a basic fact in the cosmology .",
    "now is official , the universe is flat . with this headlines ,",
    "the physicsweb site call the attention to work by bernardis et al .",
    ", in the nature @xcite , about the measures of the density of the universe .",
    "this give us another information to work , the tricurvature :    @xmath40    last , but not least , is the observation that the universe is expanding @xcite , not only expanding , but also accelerating , that is , the deceleration parameter @xmath41 is :    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the scale factor , that implies :    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the huble parameter , and hence    @xmath46    the field equations we have to work now are as follow :    for the robertson - walker s metric ,    @xmath47   \\label{f13}\\ ] ]    we find , then @xmath48    @xmath49    @xmath50    @xmath51    one can isolate @xmath52    @xmath53   \\label{f17}\\ ] ]    and @xmath54    @xmath55    @xmath56 + h\\left [ \\ddot{\\phi}\\phi -\\dot{\\phi}^{2}\\right ] \\right\\}\\ ] ]    here @xmath57 is an initial value for the density .",
    "putting @xmath6 and @xmath58 in [ f15 ] , we can isolate @xmath59 this is an important point of this work , we use the diference finite method to calculated the field variations .  we can check that :    @xmath60   } { 1 + 2h\\phi /\\dot{\\phi } }   \\label{f19}\\ ] ]    and can use :    @xmath61    in the same way :    @xmath62    and we have recorrence .",
    "we still need some information , the intial values for @xmath24 and @xmath63 and will discuss it in the next section .",
    "as we can see in [ f19 ] , @xmath64 depends on the density @xmath57 , the hubble parameter @xmath45 , that are constants .",
    "@xmath64 depends also of @xmath24 and @xmath65 and the choice of these two intial values determines the evolution of newton gravitational constant .",
    "we remember that :    @xmath66    hence @xmath67 and @xmath68 must result , when we arrive at the present universe :    @xmath69    note that we start in the past and go to the present time , so we can have values of @xmath5 in the past.[f23 ] is a final value condition .",
    "the theory has two free parmeters , the initial values for @xmath24 and @xmath63 , and could have also two constraint , @xmath5 and @xmath70 but there are few measures of @xmath71 so still there are some freedom in the choice of initial values . at the end of this work ,",
    "we show a result that consider the limit value for @xmath72 . in the brans - dicke @xcite theory , we have    @xmath73    we use this fact as a guide to the choice of @xmath74 for @xmath65 we use the relation :    @xmath75    @xmath76 is an integer .",
    "if we write :    @xmath77    where @xmath78 is a constant , each @xmath76 value will determine the value of @xmath78 , ( or we can also work in the opposite sense ) in order to satisfy relation [ f23 ] .",
    "_ this is the important point of this work , we have to choice the initial numerical values for _ @xmath24 _ and for _ @xmath79 _ these values held in the past , one billion years ago . so the ratios _ @xmath80 _ discussed here must be considered in the past .",
    "_    finally , for @xmath45 we use the same value of @xcite  that is :    @xmath81    @xmath57 comes from @xcite and it is :    @xmath82    of course , when considering the past , we have to correct this density .    with these considerations , we have performed some possible situations , that are presented in the next section .",
    "we studied some possible cases , using the datas and methods explained above , taking care that each step in our program means 10 millions of years .",
    "so in the figures below , 100 means one billion of years ago .",
    "the first case is the following : we have positive values for @xmath63 , in a way that :    @xmath83    we performed our analisys for the case @xmath84 in the figure 1 we present our results for the  case @xmath85  in our picture , the present time is on 0.0 and the past goes to right .    in figure 2",
    ", we studied another values .",
    "we use @xmath86 and 8 and @xmath63 is positive . in the figure",
    "2 we can these results .    as we can see , it 's interesting to work the case n=3 .",
    "so we studied the cases : @xmath87 and the more interesting :    @xmath88    in this case , the variation of @xmath37 is slow and the calculated value for @xmath89 is bigger than 500 .",
    "this is in agreement with observacional data @xcite .",
    "more exactly , @xmath90 ( for the present time ) .",
    "this means that this is a good starting point to search the fine tuning of the theory with the experimental  data . in the figure 3 we have the results .    for the sake of completeness",
    ", we also show the cases where we have a negative @xmath79      as a final result , after a search for the parameters that hold theory and exprimental datas , we find that using :    @xmath91    as the intial value ( one billion years ago ) , and ( also for one billion years ago )    @xmath92    we obtain the one posible value for @xmath0 one billion of years ago :    @xmath93    and the value for @xmath8 in the past , was , according to our computation    @xmath94    and the present value for @xmath6 is , according to our program : @xmath95 and finally , the present ratio : @xmath96 note that , because we have so small experimental value for this ratio , we have to use several digits in @xmath63 .",
    "these are the initial results of our proposal of perform an numerical analisys of the consequences of the scalar tensor theories of gravitation .",
    "we hope that these informations can be used in another investigations of the cosmological parameters .",
    "in this work , we consider the scalar - tensor theory of gravitation ,  which the has the proposal of study of the neton 's gravitational constant .",
    "we did n't sugest any analitycal solution to the field equations .",
    "what we have done is , based in some justified hypothesis , to calculated numerically the solutions for the fields ( @xmath97 , the coupling constant ( @xmath98 , and the main point , the values of @xmath99 on despite that the field equations are non - linear in @xmath24 and @xmath63 we have two constraints ( @xmath5 and @xmath100 )  that filter the possibilities .",
    "it 's useful to study if we can aply the uniquiness of solution under these conditions .",
    "we consider that numerical analisys presented is quite interesting , because shows the possible evolutions for the value of the newton 's gravitational constant @xmath5 in a recent period of the universe , based in a scalar tensor theory of gravitation .",
    "the same idea can be used to make some predictions about future values of g. we believe that , if one consider our basic hypothesis valid , ( @xmath101 accelerating universe , @xmath102 it 's worthwhile to work to find the intial values of @xmath24 and @xmath63 that results in the present values of @xmath5 and @xmath72 ( if the last one is measured ) . the numerical approach used here",
    "can be improved to work with a more accurate step in the program ( less than 10 millions of years ) .",
    "another point is that our computational program shows that is possible a change in the signal of @xmath70 so we may especulate that @xmath5 can start to grow .",
    "we can also consider that , if the newton 's gravitational constant have changed in the last one billion of years , there are consequences and evidences that can be search in the geological or astronomical fields of knowledge , for a compreensive discussion about these implications , see @xcite .",
    "eventually , the study of gravitational waves can give some information about the value of @xmath5 in the past , or , in the opposite sense , these study can use some information about the numerical evolution of @xmath0 gravitational waves in the scalar - tensor theories are studied in @xcite .    as a final consideration",
    ", we remember that we use @xmath103 it 's possible propose many different forms for @xmath104 in our humble opinion , if we think that even the theorethical part is not solved yet , hence the numerical one , in a way that it 's possible to perform several  approachs to the problem .                              * fig 1:g as a time function , when we consider the some ratios between * @xmath24 * *  and * * @xmath105 * *  in this case * * @xmath106 * * , where * * @xmath107solid line),@xmath108long dashed line)*or 3(shor dashed line ) .",
    "it 's important to observe that in this picture , the time goes from the right to left , being 0.00 the present time and 100 one billion of years ago .",
    "the same notation is used in the another grafics .",
    "*    * fig 2 :  the case n=4,(solid ) 6 ( dashed ) and 8 .",
    "* @xmath63 * is positive*.*we can see that n=6 and n=8producesalmost the same results , so one line superposes the another .",
    "we can also see that we have a growing g(t ) , and also note this is an acceleratting growing . due this",
    "we will eliminate these results of a `` fine tunning '' analisys .",
