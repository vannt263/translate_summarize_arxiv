    "intermediate- and high - velocity clouds ( ivcs and hvcs ) are routinely being studied in optical emission lines thanks to advances in detector and instrument design ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in particular",
    ", the efficiency of the wisconsin h - alpha mapper ( wham ) allows a multi - wavelength study of the ionized component over the entire extent of these predominantly neutral structures .",
    "the relationship between the h@xmath0  and 21 cm emitting gas should provide important clues into the source of ionization and conditions within the galactic halo .",
    "lyman continuum radiation is believed to escape the disk with sufficient flux to maintain the warm ionized medium ( wim ) of the milky way and thus may also ionize the downward facing surfaces of neutral halo material ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , high ionization species are also detected toward these complexes , suggesting that alternative forms of ionization and sources of lyman continuum radiation may be important .",
    "conductive interfaces or turbulent mixing layers arising from the interaction of the neutral gas with a very low density halo component have often been cited as mechanisms able to complete the picture of these anomalous structures @xcite .",
    "we have embarked on an extended multi - wavelength study of the large - scale complexes with wham to explore the physical conditions in the ionized gas of ivcs and hvcs and to study the relationship of this component to the neutral gas . here",
    "we present the first map of the ionized component of complex l , first designated by @xcite to be 21 cm emission present between @xmath5 km",
    "s@xmath2  @xmath6 km  s@xmath2  in the approximate range @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in this work , we examine a slightly larger region of the sky that shows intermediate - velocity emission in both 21 cm and h@xmath0  at slightly higher latitudes and longitudes that may be physically related to the gas previously defined to be complex l.    there have been a few previous detections of h@xmath0  emission from complex l. @xcite and @xcite find emission ( @xmath9 0.2  1 r ) toward several directions near higher column - density clumps of the complex .",
    "these emitting regions are also reported to have very high [ ] /h@xmath0  ratios ( 1  2.7 ) . here ,",
    "we present the first map of the entire ionized component of complex l.",
    "all 21 cm data presented in this work was extracted from the lieden / dwingeloo survey ( lds ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and has a resolution of 05 on the sky and a spectral resolution of 1 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "a portion of the lower - velocity h@xmath0  emission from complex l is present in the wham northern sky survey ( wham - nss ) .",
    "see @xcite for details of wham and the survey .",
    "additional h@xmath0  data was obtained in 2004 april toward this region of the sky at the same pointing directions as the wham - nss but with the velocity window shifted to capture @xmath10 km  s@xmath2 @xmath11 km",
    "s@xmath2  and with twice the exposure time ( 60 sec per pointing ) . these data were processed , calibrated , and cleaned of atmospheric emission using a procedure very similar to that used for the nss ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "additionally , we have applied an estimated correction for the attenuation of h@xmath0  emission within each beam using the integrated @xmath4  between @xmath12 km  s@xmath2 @xmath13 km  s@xmath2 , the relationship between @xmath4  and extinction found by @xcite , and the analytic extinction law provided by @xcite .",
    "the number of assumptions in this correction make the resulting intrinsic h@xmath0  intensities only approximate .",
    "however , we hope to remove at least some of the apparent variation in the emission that may be due to foreground extinction . the average correction for the pointings in this region is @xmath14 .    for the results presented here ,",
    "the two h@xmath0  spectra ( with different velocity ranges ) for each pointing were not combined into a single spectrum . instead , except for one of the velocity - integrated channel maps presented below",
    ", the analysis focuses on using the newly taken data where the intermediate- and high - velocity emission is better placed within each spectrum .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows two velocity - integrated channel maps of h@xmath0  emission toward the region of the sky containing complex l. contours outline 21 cm emission from the neutral gas in the region .",
    "the bulk of the emission in both lines arises from distinct velocity components centered within the integrated ranges except for the brighter emission at @xmath15 in figure  [ fig1]a , which is contamination from the wing of very bright , low - velocity emission in the @xmath16 sco region ( @xmath17 r ; @xmath18 to @xmath19 km  s@xmath2 ) . in both maps ,",
    "the h@xmath0  and 21 cm emission are present over the same general regions and have similar spatial extents . but as with complex k @xcite , the intensities of each line do not trace each other in detail .    in comparison with the earlier pointed observations made toward complex l by @xcite and @xcite , our measurements toward similar directions are roughly consistent but systematically lower .",
    "in particular , the wham observations made here with one - degree resolution do not show emission levels as high as those found by @xcite .",
    "however , both of these studies have effective beam sizes smaller than wham by factors of 610 .",
    "if significant variation of @xmath3  occurs on smaller scales , these measurements are not necessarily inconsistent .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows sample spectra from the ionized and neutral components of complex l. the h@xmath0  emission profile is displayed along with an average 21 cm spectrum constructed from lds beams whose centers fall within the one - degree diameter wham beam",
    ". both the location of the components and their velocity extents are quite similar .",
    "although the relative intensities between the components change substantially over the area of complex l , the similar location and shape of the emission profiles are a constant feature .    to explore the nature of this connection more quantitatively , we developed a straightforward single - gaussian , auto - fitting program .",
    "since the majority of the component emission from complex l is well - separated from local emission features , a reasonable number of the profiles can be easily fit with such a routine . for our first pass at such an analysis",
    ", we followed the following prescription :    * only fit if the integrated intensity is @xmath20 mr or @xmath21 * fit over the range @xmath22 km  s@xmath2 @xmath23 km  s@xmath2 * reject fits with : * * large @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) * * mean velocity outside the fitting window * * very small ( @xmath26 km  s@xmath2 ) or large ( @xmath27 km  s@xmath2 ) fwhm * * negative area    using only the newer h@xmath0  dataset with the velocity window shifted for better placement of the complex l emission , about 30% of the pointings result in `` good '' fits .",
    "for the 21 cm dataset , about 15% satisfy these criteria .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows a representation of how the mean velocities from these fits are distributed across the sky . here",
    ", each emission line is displayed at its original resolution ( @xmath28 for h@xmath0 , @xmath29 for 21 cm ) with the size of the plot symbol proportional to the area of the fitted component .    when using 21 cm beams averaged to the match the h@xmath0  observations , 49 directions produce `` good '' fits in both emission lines suitable for quantitative comparison .",
    "figures [ fig4 ] through [ fig6 ] plot the 21 cm and h@xmath0  values against one another for each of the three gaussian fit parameters .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows that although there is a general poor correlation between @xmath4  and @xmath3 , the lack of points in the lower right - hand portion of the diagram and the shape of the lower envelope of the scatter suggest that perhaps there exists some relationship between the two . empirically , one can interpret this facet of the scatter as a limit on the maximum @xmath3  for a given column of neutral gas or that an increase in a minimum @xmath4  must be present to support the observed increase in h@xmath0  brightness .",
    "neither statement places strong constraints on a source of ionization for the complex . if the cloud is bathed in radiation by an external source ( _ e.g. _ , the galaxy or diffuse , cooling halo gas ) , increased pathlengths along the ionized `` skin '' of the cloud ( _ i.e. _ , lines - of - sight that are not perpendicular to a ionized - neutral boundary ) will drive both emission quantities up together . in a scenario where a local source dominates the ionization of the complex , contact between the neutral gas and hot halo material generates a limited amount of ionizing radiation for each such interface",
    "however , lines - of - sight piercing many interface regions can add up to the total neutral and ionized emission observed .",
    "the variation in the number of such regions crossed in each observation could provide a base connection between @xmath3  and @xmath4  in those interface regions .",
    "however , in either case , the fact that @xmath4  ranges rather independently from @xmath3  beyond this lower envelope suggests that the primary parameters of the ionized region are determined by the details of the ionizing field rather than the physical distribution of the neutral material .",
    "the widths of the components ( figure  [ fig5 ] ) trace each other somewhat with a typical fwhm @xmath30 3040 km  s@xmath2 , but the low signal - to - noise of these faint emitting regions prevents much further analysis with this set of observations alone .",
    "such a general value for the width puts an upper limit on the gas temperature of about 35,000 k. future observations of [ ] and [ ] should help constrain this value further .",
    "[ fig6 ]    finally , figure  [ fig6 ] shows the close relationship in velocity between the neutral and ionized gas . from our analysis",
    "there is a slight shift of the h@xmath0  velocity centers compared to the neutral emission .",
    "a formal fit gives a shift of @xmath31 km  s@xmath2  away from the line of unity plotted in figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "various checks of the calibration of the h@xmath0  velocity scale have been preformed , but a variety of methods show the data have a scale that is correct to better than 1 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "we can confidentially rule this out as an explanation for the shift .",
    "the shift between the components also is not a function of any of the gaussian parameters for either component , suggesting that the fitting routine is not failing systematically in regions of questionable parameter space ( _ e.g. _ , when one of the components becomes very faint ) .",
    "further observations of other ionized species should help to confirm or reject this finding .",
    "if this relationship holds , a few scenarios involving ionizing processes do allow for small kinematic shifts of the neutral and ionized components .",
    "the velocity suggested here is too low to be indicative of a shock , however conductive interfaces and turbulent mixing layers could result in small relative motions @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , external photoionization can also produce a dynamical effect as the ionized gas flows off the face of the neutral cloud ( _ i.e. _ , the  rocket - effect  ; * ? ? ? * ) . in the case of escaping ionizing radiation from the galaxy ,",
    "the geometry of ivcs and hvcs targets may be quite conducive to revealing such a process as a blue - shifted signature since the observer and ionizing source lie in approximately the same direction relative to the clouds .",
    "we have presented the first map of the ionized gas in the intermediate - velocity cloud complex l. the ionized gas is very clearly spatially and kinematically linked to the neutral gas .",
    "however , the intensity of the h@xmath0  emission arising from the ionized component of the complex varies independently from the 21 cm emission of the neutral component .",
    "interesting trends including a small systematic offset in the mean velocity of each component and a hints of a relationship in a large sample of @xmath3  and @xmath4  measurements may start to provide clues about the details of what sustains the ionization in ivcs and hvcs .",
    "in addition to mapping out other complexes in h@xmath0 , we will soon begin exploring the physical conditions in the ionized component of these halo clouds by leveraging the multi - wavelength capabilities of wham .",
