    "recent realization of an ultracold fermi - fermi mixture of @xmath0k and @xmath1li with interspecies feshbach resonances opens up new research directions in cold atomic physics  @xcite .",
    "such examples include the creation of the bose - einstein condensate of heteronuclear molecules and the investigation of the effect of mass difference on the superfluidity .",
    "more importantly , the two - species mixture offers the possibility of species - selective confinement potentials , which provides novel subjects such as fermi gases imbalanced in terms of the dimensionality of space  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that when @xmath0k is confined in one dimension or two dimensions with @xmath1li being in three dimensions , the @xmath0k-@xmath1li mixture with a resonant interspecies interaction exhibits the efimov effect characterized by an infinite series of shallow three - body bound states ( trimers ) composed of two heavy and one light fermions .",
    "their binding energies are given by @xmath3 with @xmath4 being the reduced mass and @xmath5 in the one - dimensional@xmath2three - dimensional ( 1d-3d ) mixed dimensions and @xmath6 in the two - dimensional@xmath2three - dimensional ( 2d-3d ) mixed dimensions  @xcite .",
    "@xmath7 is the so - called efimov parameter defined up to multiplicative factors of @xmath8 and will be calculated in this rapid communication .",
    "the emergence of such efimov trimers in the @xmath0k-@xmath1li mixture is remarkable because they are absent in a free space but induced by confining @xmath0k in lower dimensions .",
    "an alternative way to realize the efimov effect using the @xmath0k-@xmath1li mixture would be to apply an optical lattice to @xmath0k to increase its effective mass by more than a factor of 2  @xcite .    in this rapid communication",
    ", we will show that the efimov effect in the @xmath0k-@xmath1li mixture when @xmath0k is confined in 1d , is experimentally observable through the three - body recombination rate which has a characteristic logarithmic - periodic behavior as a function of the effective scattering length .",
    "in particular , the three - body recombination rate is found to exhibit resonant peaks that can be explained by _ confinement - induced efimov resonances_. we note that the three - body recombination rate has been successfully employed to obtain evidences for the efimov trimers in a bose gas of @xmath9cs  @xcite , a bose - bose mixture of @xmath10rb and @xmath11k  @xcite , and a three - component fermi gas of @xmath1li  @xcite .",
    "before developing an exact analysis of the three - body recombination rate , it is worthwhile to demonstrate how the efimov effect is realized by confining @xmath0k in 1d . for generality , we shall consider a three - body problem of two @xmath12 atoms and one @xmath13 atom with the resonant interspecies interaction in which a two - dimensional harmonic potential is applied to only @xmath12 atoms .",
    "when the @xmath12 atoms are much heavier than the @xmath13 atom @xmath14 , one can first solve the schrdinger equation for the @xmath13 atom with fixed positions of the @xmath12 atoms , which generates the following effective potential between two @xmath12 atoms : @xmath15 , with @xmath16 .",
    "then , the relative motion of @xmath12 atoms is governed by the schrdinger equation ( here and below @xmath17 ) @xmath18\\psi({{\\bm{r } } } )   = \\left(e_3+\\omega\\right)\\psi({{\\bm{r}}}),\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the oscillator frequency and @xmath20 with @xmath21 is relative coordinates between two @xmath12 atoms .",
    "fermi statistics of @xmath12 atoms implies @xmath22 .",
    "in a free space @xmath23 , it is known that the mass ratio @xmath24 for the @xmath0k-@xmath1li mixture is too small to form efimov trimers  @xcite . however , the confinement potential term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : schrodinger ] ) makes it possible by effectively reducing the dimensionality of @xmath12 atoms . when @xmath25 , bound - state wave functions with @xmath26 behave at long distance @xmath27 as @xmath28 here @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the confinement length . for shallow bound states @xmath31 , the bessel function in eq .",

    "( [ eq : schrodinger ] ) for @xmath33 .",
    "the oscillating asymptotic behavior implies that there exists an infinite number of bound states with two successive binding energies separated by a factor of @xmath34 .",
    "in particular , in the case of @xmath0k-@xmath1li mixture with @xmath24 , we find @xmath35 for @xmath36 , from which we obtain @xmath37 and the efimov parameter @xmath7 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : efimov ] ) as @xmath38 .",
    "one should bear in mind that those numbers may not be accurate because of the born - oppenheimer approximation we employed  @xcite .",
    "however , the analysis presented here reveals the remarkable qualitative aspect of the efimov effect induced by the confinement potential : the efimov parameter is determined by the confinement length , and therefore it is tunable by an external optical trap to a certain extent .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to other systems in a free space where efimov parameters are determined by short - range physics that is in general difficult to control .",
    "if the confinement length @xmath39 is much smaller than mean interatomic distances and the thermal de broglie wavelength of the system at finite densities and temperature , one can consider @xmath12 atoms to be fixed on the 1d line neglecting their motion in the confinement direction .",
    "consequently , the resulting system becomes a two - species fermi gas in the 1d-3d mixed dimensions  @xcite .",
    "however , when the efimov effect is present , the confinement length scale can not be removed from the problem completely but appears as the efimov parameter @xmath7 in the three - body scattering problem as we will see below .",
    "in order to develop a model - independent analysis of the efimov effect in our system , it is useful to adopt an effective field theory approach , which has been a powerful method to study the efimov physics in identical bosons  @xcite .",
