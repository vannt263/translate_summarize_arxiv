    "<S> the relatively high residual resistivity in ybagge strongly reduces the electronic thermal conductivity . </S>",

    "<S> although we can not justify this linear temperature dependence , which arises from the inclusion of bosonic contributions to @xmath61 , it nevertheless allows us to obtain the 0 k values by simple linear extrapolation . at @xmath62  t , </S>",

    "<S> thermodynamic indications for quantum criticality in accordance with the itinerant hertz - millis scenario have been found  @xcite , although the approach of the qcep is cut - off by the formation of a nematic phase in the former and crossover to landau fermi liquid behavior in the latter case . </S>",

    "<S> on the other hand , the metamagnetic behavior is more local in nature , resulting in strong critical fluctuations that may lead to a destruction of the quasiparticles at the entire fermi surface . at @xmath81  t </S>",
    "<S> , previous transport measurements have found an abrupt jump in the field - dependence of the hall coefficient  @xcite and sign change of the isothermal thermopower @xmath82 at low temperatures  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these observations indeed suggest a significant change of the fermi surface at this field .    </S>",
    "<S> another distinct difference of ybagge to sr@xmath32ru@xmath14o@xmath33 and ceru@xmath14si@xmath14 is the geometrical frustration of yb@xmath83 magnetic moments on the distorted kagome lattice . </S>",
    "<S> it is anticipated that the metamagnetic transition is associated with a weakening of the magnetic frustration . </S>",
    "<S> once the metamagnetic transition is tuned towards zero temperature , the long - wavelength critical fluctuations of the order parameter start showing quantum mechanical character and play an important role . </S>",
    "<S> the coexistence of magnetic frustration and quantum fluctuations may reinforce each other , giving rise to an increasing proportion of inelastic scattering of electrons . </S>",

    "<S> we have studied the low - temperature electrical resistivity and thermal conductivity of ybagge . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of the lorenz ratio @xmath3 indicates an anomalous suppression at the critical field @xmath2  t of a metamagnetic quantum critical end point . </S>",
    "<S> although we can not neglect or subtract the phonon and magnon contributions to thermal conductivity , the observed linear temperature dependence of @xmath3 for all different fields allows to extrapolate towards @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> such extrapolation yields a value significantly below 1 ( @xmath84 ) only very close to @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests strong inelastic scattering even at absolute zero temperature due to the disintegration of heavy quasiparticles . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that magnetic frustration and the more local magnetic character compared to itinerant metamagnets like sr@xmath32ru@xmath14o@xmath33 and ceru@xmath14si@xmath14 is responsible for this behavior .    </S>",
