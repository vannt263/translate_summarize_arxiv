    "the investigation of anharmonic effects ( ae ) in lattice dynamics is a classical problem of solid - state physics .",
    "it is important , particularly , because of the role these effects can play in phenomena associated with structural phase transitions and melting in crystals ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . at the same time , obtaining any information about the magnitude and scale of aes from experiment and theory is a difficult problem .",
    "the experimental study of such `` basic '' aes as the frequency shift and damping of phonons is very difficult and leads to a large uncertainty in the results ( see , e.g. , the data presented in @xcite for bcc and fcc metals , respectively ) . up to now first - principles microscopic calculations of aes have been performed for one point of the brillouin zone ( n ) in the bcc phase of zr and four points ( n ,",
    "p,@xmath0,g ) in mo @xcite . detailed information about aes in the entire brillouin zone and their temperature dependence has been obtained in @xcite on the basis of pseudopotential theory for the bcc phases of alkali and alkaline - earth metals . for these metals",
    "the most striking manifestations of aes are due to the `` soft - mode behavior''(the anomalous temperature dependence of the phonon frequencies ) of the @xmath1 branch .",
    "it is of interest to calculate aes for the `` general position '' , i.e. for crystals which do not possess soft vibrational modes .",
    "such crystals include most metals with close - packed structures , for example , fcc . in a recent paper @xcite the results of calculations performed for the anharmonic effects in lattice dynamics of ir having the fcc structure",
    "have been presented . in order to understand the specific features of aes in lattice dynamics , related to structural phase transitions",
    ", it is interesting to investigate them in several phases for polymorphic metals .",
    "a classical example of structural phase transitions in metals is the fcc - bcc temperature transition in ca and sr @xcite",
    ". therefore studies of ae features in these metals seem to be important . in the present paper the ae features in ca and sr lattice dynamics and thermodynamics",
    "have been investigated basing on microscopic calculations of the heat capacity , thermal expansion , temperature frequency shifts , damping of phonons and gruneisen parameters .",
    "as noted in introduction , at present , _ ab initio _ calculations of phonon frequency with regard to ae have been only done for some highly symmetric points of the brillouin zone in a few metals @xcite .",
    "consistent _ ab initio _ calculations of such quantities as phonon damping , as well as thermal expansion coefficients and other integral anharmonic effects in metals are now extremely difficult . therefore in works reported so far @xcite particular models of interatomic interactions were used .",
    "for example , for alkali metals @xcite and ir @xcite the pair interaction approximation basing on pseudopotential theory was used , which gives a reliable description of a variety of lattice properties of these metals .",
    "construction of a similar model for alkaline - earth metals appears to be difficult because of the specific features of electron structure .",
    "the fcc phase of ca and sr has many van hove singularities in the density of electron states near the fermi level @xmath2 and , therefore , for the adequate description of lattice properties allowance for related contributions to the total energy is important @xcite . at the same time , the fermi surface for these metals is close to that in the approximation of almost free electrons , and parameter @xmath3 ( where * g * is the reciprocal lattice vector , @xmath4 is the fourier component of pseudopotential ) is small ( less than @xmath5 ) @xcite .",
    "as shown in @xcite , under these conditions the proximity of the fermi surface to the brillouin zone boundary essentially contributes to the elastic moduli and to frequencies of long - wave phonons with the wave vector @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the van - hove singularity nearest to @xmath2 , @xmath8 is the minimum vector of reciprocal lattice while the corresponding anomalous contributions to frequencies of phonons with @xmath9 are much weaker .",
    "therefore it may be expected that for the description of thermodynamics of fcc phase of ca and sr for @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 is the debye temperature ) the ordinary approximation of pairwise interactions corresponding to the second order to perturbation theory for @xmath3 would be applicable .",
    "this model was successfully used in @xcite for the description of the phonon spectra of ca and sr in the high temperature bcc phase .    in the present paper the phonon spectra ,",
    "thermodynamic and anharmonic properties were calculated using the model corresponding to the second order of perturbation theory for pseudopotential ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . for the latter the animalou - heine expression @xmath12 \\exp \\left[-0.03\\left(\\frac{q}{2k_{f_0 } } \\right ) ^4\\right ] \\label{2}\\ ] ] was used , where @xmath13 is the ion charge , @xmath14 is the electron charge , @xmath15 , u are the pseudopotential parameters listed in table [ table1 ] , @xmath16 is the fermi momentum at zero pressure . for the screening the geldart - taylor approximation @xcite with the ceperley - alder expression for correlation energy was used ( see @xcite for details ) . to eliminate the influence of fcc band structure peculiarities ( the closeness of the fermi surface to the bounadaries of the brillouin zone ) , parameters @xmath15 and @xmath17 were fitted to the properties of high - temperature bcc phase : @xmath18 and @xmath19 for sr and @xmath18 and @xmath20 for ca . here",
