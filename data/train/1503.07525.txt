    "<S> we note that the total forward negativity bound @xmath75 of   is insensitive to the measurement negativity @xmath37 , instead depending only on @xmath76 .    </S>",
    "<S> any efficiently computable symmetry of the born rule can be used to give a variant on the procedure defined above . </S>",
    "<S> the rate of convergence of the estimator need not be symmetric under these born rule symmetries , and so such a variant may provide an advantage . </S>",

    "<S> _ example : estimation with the discrete wigner function.__the odd-@xmath1 qudit stabilizer subtheory and the associated discrete wigner function provide a canonical example for demonstrating the use of our algorithm ; see also ref .  @xcite . using this discrete wigner representation for our estimation algorithm </S>",
    "<S> , the nonnegativity of the stabilizer subtheory  @xcite ensures that stabilizer states , gates , and rank-1 measurements have negativity @xmath78 and so are `` free '' resources . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , due to the existence of nonnegatively represented operations that are not in the stabilizer polytope  @xcite , our approach is efficient on a strictly larger set of circuits than those of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> circuits with operations possessing negativity strictly greater than 1 , such as magic states and non - clifford gates , can still be estimated but now come at a cost . provided the total negativity bound grows at most polynomially in @xmath0 , our protocol provides an efficient estimator .    as an example , consider a circuit with an input state given by a product state of @xmath79 qutrit magic states @xmath80 , with @xmath81 , together with stabilizer @xmath82 states in a 100-qutrit random clifford circuit , and estimate the probability of measuring @xmath82 on the first qutrit of the output . </S>",
    "<S> the total forward negativity bound of this circuit scales exponentially in @xmath79 and consequently the number of samples required to guarantee a fixed precision scales exponentially in @xmath79 by eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> the results of our numerical simulations , shown in fig .  [ fig : randomcliffords ] , indicate that our estimator does indeed converge with an appropriately chosen number of samples . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , while the true precision of @xmath70 in our simulations is often orders of magnitude better than the target precision , there are circuits that come close to saturating the target precision , suggesting that our bound can not be substantially improved without further detailed knowledge of the circuit .     between the estimated probability and the true probability of the outcome @xmath83 for the first qutrit as a function of the number of magic states @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> each data point represents a random 100-qutrit clifford circuit with the non - magic states initialized to the @xmath82 state . the number of samples @xmath84 was chosen using eq .   with target precision @xmath85 ( indicated by the solid line ) with 95% confidence ( @xmath86 ) , </S>",
    "<S> so the number of samples increases exponentially with @xmath79 ( color scale ) . ]    _ _ discussion.__our results highlight the role of the total negativity of a circuit as a resource required for a quantum computer to outperform any classical computer . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , any circuit element that is represented nonnegatively does not contribute to the total negativity bound and can be viewed as a `` free '' resource within the algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> other circuit elements have an associated cost quantified by their negativity , _ unless _ they appear at the final timestep of the algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> this latter observation motivates us to exploit the time - reversal and other symmetries of the born rule , seeking to minimize the total forward ( or reverse ) negativity bound . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , one could seek equivalent circuits wherein negative operations can be replaced with nonnegative ones by using negative initial states or measurements via gate teleportation . by choosing the forward or reverse procedure as appropriate , the efficiency can be made insensitive to the negativity of these initial states or measurements .    </S>",
    "<S> it also motivates us to identify quasiprobability representations in which many of the circuit elements of interest are represented nonnegatively . </S>",
    "<S> interesting and relevant examples abound , beyond the well - studied qudit discrete wigner function . </S>",
    "<S> discrete wigner functions for qubits ( @xmath87 ) can be defined for which all stabilizer states with real coefficients ( rebits ) and all css - preserving unitaries are nonnegatively represented  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the range of quasiprobability representations introduced in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite represent discrete subgroups of @xmath88 on a single qubit nonnegatively , but have no nonnegative entangling gates ; as such representations can represent certain non - stabilizer single - qubit states nonnegatively , they may be useful for estimation in circuits for gate synthesis . </S>",
    "<S> there is also flexibility in how a quasiprobability representation is defined . </S>",
    "<S> for example , a given quasiprobability representation can be modified to describe more states nonnegatively at the expense of a decreasing set of nonnegative measurements , and vice versa , by exploiting the structure of the dual frames . </S>",
    "<S> overcomplete frames provides freedom in the choice of dual frame , and the negativity of unitaries and measurements will depend on this choice . </S>",
    "<S> as the dual frames formalism itself captures the relationship between quantum states and measurements , there is also freedom in the definition of the quasiprobability representation of unitaries beyond that given by eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> finally , again using the freedom in the choice of dual for overcomplete frames , it is possible to switch between frames throughout a single circuit . these freedoms can be used to minimize the total negativity bound of the circuit , allowing more efficient estimators .    </S>",
    "<S> our procedure can be applied to infinite - dimensional hilbert spaces using any of the range of quasiprobability representations with continuous phase spaces developed in the study of quantum optics , by performing an appropriate discretization as in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in this case , the negativity of distributions is quantified by integrating the absolute value of the distributions over the phase space , and is directly related to the _ volume _ of negativity  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the resulting estimator can be applied to quantum optics experiments including states and measurements with negative wigner function , such as photon number fock states , and so may provide additional insight into the classical simulation cost of boson sampling  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while there exist means to efficiently estimate the outcome probability of a specific linear optics circuit with fock state input and measurement  @xcite , our estimation procedure extends these results by providing a general method for estimating outcome probabilities of such linear optical circuits for any input and output together with a bound on the efficiency of this estimation based on the volume of negativity of these states . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , our estimation can easily incorporate squeezing , as well as the loss and noise mechanisms common to linear optics experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> there are two natural ways to extend our results to circuits that include intermediate measurements and conditional operations based on them . </S>",
    "<S> first , one could replace the measurement and conditional operation with a coherently - controlled operation , and delay the measurement to the end . </S>",
    "<S> we note that such controlled operations can be negative , even if the measurement and classically - controlled operation are both nonnegative . </S>",
    "<S> second , our algorithm can be used to directly estimate the probabilities of the intermediate measurements and to sample from them . in this case , the required precision is exponential in the number of intermediate measurements in order to calculate conditional probabilities for subsequent use in the algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in general , both approaches require resources that are exponential in the number of intermediate measurements .    finally , our estimation procedure provides insight into the study of operationally meaningful measures of non - classical resources in quantum computation . </S>",
    "<S> negativity in a quasiprobability representation has long been used as an indicator of quantum behaviour , but only recently has it been quantified as a resource for quantum computation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our results provide a related operational meaning of this resource : as a measure that bounds the efficiency of a classical estimation of probabilities .    </S>",
