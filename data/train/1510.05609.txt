    "the static toroidal dipole , also known as anapole , was first considered by zeldovich in 1957@xcite .",
    "the toroidal dipole has since been acknowledged in nuclear and atomic physics , where it is held responsible for parity violations in electroweak interactions@xcite , as well as in solid - state physics , where it leads to a special type of ordering in multiferroics @xcite .",
    "the notion of the tororidal dipole was eventually extended to the dynamic case , where it generated a whole family of radiating toroidal multipoles@xcite , commonly omitted from standard literature on the electrodynamics@xcite . while electric and magnetic multipoles are respectively linked to the oscillations of charges and transverse currents , the toroidal multipoles result from the oscillations of radial currents , which tend to be neglected in the long wavelength limit @xcite .",

    "we show theoretically how a simple structure formed by interacting plasmonic nanorods can support a collective excitation eigenmode that corresponds to a radiating toroidal moment .",
