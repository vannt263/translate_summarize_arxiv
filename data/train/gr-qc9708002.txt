    "in many physical systems , boundary conditions are both the most important and the most difficult part of a theoretical treatment . in computational approaches ,",
    "boundaries pose further difficulties .",
    "even with an analytic form of the correct physical boundary condition in hand , there are usually many more unstable numerical implementations than stable ones .",
    "nowhere is the boundary problem more acute than in the computation of gravitational radiation produced in the coalescence of two black holes . in order to avoid the topological complications introduced by the black holes ,",
    "the proposed strategy for attacking this problem , initially suggested by w. unruh @xcite , is to excise an interior region surrounded by an apparent horizon . these are uncharted waters and there are many different tactics that can be pursued to attain an apparent horizon boundary condition .",
    "@xcite one common feature of all current approaches to this problem is the use of a cauchy evolution algorithm in the interior region bordering the apparent horizon . in this paper",
    "we present an alternative tactic based upon a characteristic evolution in that inner region ; and we present a simple model of its global implementation .    in order to provide orientation , we begin with a synopsis of the apparent horizon boundary condition and its computational difficulties .",
    "an apparent horizon is the boundary of the region on a cauchy hypersurface containing trapped surfaces @xcite .",
    "this explicit reference to a cauchy hypersurface in the definition gives an apparent horizon an elusive nature .",
    "indeed , there are cauchy hypersurfaces in the extended schwarzschild spacetime which come arbitrarily close to the final singularity but do not contain an apparent horizon @xcite .",
    "there is strong reason to believe that the same is true in any spherically symmetric black hole spacetime .",
    "on the other hand , when they exist , apparent horizons are useful spacetime markers because they must lie inside the true event horizon @xcite .",
    "consequently , signals can not propagate causally from the apparent horizon to future null infinity @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath1    thus truncation of the interior spacetime at the apparent horizon does not affect the gravitational waves radiated to infinity .",
    "this is the physical rationale behind the apparent horizon boundary condition .",
    "there is a gauge ambiguity in the inner boundary defined by an apparent horizon which is associated with the choice of cauchy foliation .",
    "such an ambiguity is not associated with the event horizon .",
    "however , the event horizon is of no practical use in a cauchy evolution since it can only be constructed in retrospect , after the global geometry of the spacetime has been determined .",
    "a better alternative is the trapping horizon @xcite , defined as the boundary of the spacetime region containing trapped surfaces . here",
    "the reference to cauchy hypersurfaces is dropped while retaining the quasilocal concept of trapped surfaces .",
    "trapping horizons exist in any black hole spacetime whereas the existence of apparent horizons is dependent on the choice of cauchy foliation .    in practice ,",
    "the problem of locating trapped surfaces is partially solved in the process of setting initial data . for the 3-dimensional problem of two inspiraling black holes ,",
    "there are several numerical approaches for determining appropriate initial cauchy data @xcite .",
    "an apparent horizon , when it exists , is a marginally trapped surface and lies on the trapping horizon . once the initial cauchy hypersurface cuts across a trapping horizon in this way , the scenario for pathological foliations is not present initially ; and a reasonable choice of lapse should guarantee that future cauchy hypersurfaces continue to contain that component of the apparent horizon .",
    "however , in the two black hole problem , besides the two disjoint apparent horizons present initially , an outer apparent horizon ( surrounding them ) is expected to form at a later time .",
    "finding and locating this outer apparent horizon can make the computational problem enormously easier by using it as the new inner boundary at this stage .",
    "excellent progress has been made in designing apparent horizon finders and trackers for this purpose .",
    "however , it is not known what lapse condition on a cauchy foliation would guarantee that an outer apparent horizon form at the earliest possible time .",
    "besides these geometrical issues there are a number of serious computational difficulties in implementing an apparent horizon boundary condition . in order to obtain gravitational waveforms ,",
    "the computational domain must cover a time interval of the order of several hundred @xmath2 in the exterior region whereas typically a singularity forms on a time of order @xmath2 in the region close to the apparent horizon .",
    "thus a slicing which avoids the singularity for several hundred @xmath2 will necessarily develop coordinate singularities .",
    "in addition , the inner boundary traced out by an apparent horizon is generically spacelike ( at best lightlike ) .",
    "thus if the coordinates defining the numerical grid were to remain constant in time on the boundary ( `` apparent horizon locking '' ) then the coordinate trajectories would have to be superluminal . while horizon locking works in the spherically symmetric case @xcite , it is difficult to implement in a cartesian 3-dimensional grid .",
    "the alternative is to let the apparent horizon move through the coordinate grid . at the same time , the location of the apparent horizon must be determined by solving an elliptic equation or an equivalent extremum problem .",
    "the requirements on the grid are further complicated when the black hole is spinning . on top of all these difficulties , the computational techniques must ensure that the strong fields inside the apparent horizon boundary do not severely leak into the exterior due to finite difference approximations . causal differencing @xcite and algorithms based upon a strictly hyperbolic version of the initial value problem @xcite",
    "have been proposed to avoid this .",
    "however , no 3-dimensional cauchy code has yet been successful in evolving a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "= 3.2 in    it is clear that the 3-dimensional coalescence of black holes challenges the limits of computational know - how .",
    "we wish to present here a new approach for excising an interior trapped region which might provide enhanced flexibility in tackling this important problem . in this approach , we locate the interior boundary of the cauchy evolution _",
    "outside _ the apparent horizon . across this inner cauchy boundary",
    "we match to a characteristic evolution based upon an ingoing family of null hypersurfaces .",
    "it is the inner boundary condition for the characteristic evolution which is then given by a null hypersurface version of the apparent horizon boundary condition . in the case of two black holes ,",
    "the inner boundary would consist of two disjoint topological spheres , chosen so that their inner directed null normals are converging .",
    "fig [ fig : tblackholes ] provides a schematic picture of the global strategy .",
    "two disjoint characteristic evolutions , based upon ingoing null hypersurfaces , are matched across worldtubes a and b to a cauchy evolution of the shaded region .",
    "the interior boundary of each of these characteristic evolutions borders a region containing trapped surfaces .",
    "the outer boundary of the cauchy region is another worldtube c , which matches to an exterior characteristic evolution based upon outgoing null hypersurfaces extending to null infinity .",
    "this strategy offers several advantages in addition to the possibility of restricting the cauchy evolution to the region outside the black holes .",
    "although , finding a marginally trapped surface on the ingoing null hypersurfaces remains an elliptic problem , there is a natural radial coordinate system @xmath3 to facilitate its solution .",
    "however it is also possible to locate a trapped surface on the ingoing null hypersurface by a purely algebraic condition .",
    "since this trapped surface ( when it exists ) lies in the region invisible to @xmath0 it can be used to replace the trapping horizon as the inner boundary . in either case",
    ", moving the black hole through the grid reduces to a 1-dimensional radial motion , leaving the angular grid intact and thus reducing the complexity of the computational masks which excise the inner region .",
    "( the angular coordinates can even rotate relative to the cauchy coordinates in order to accommodate spinning black holes ) .",
    "the chief problem of this approach is that a caustic may be encountered on the ingoing null hypersurface before entering the trapped region .",
    "this is again a problem whose solution lies in choosing the right initial data and also the right geometric shape of the two - surface across which the cauchy and characteristic evolutions are matched .",
    "there is a great deal of flexibility here because of the important feature that initial data can be posed on a null hypersurface without constraints .",
    "the strategy of matching an interior cauchy evolution to an exterior _ outgoing _ characteristic evolution has been described @xcite and implemented to provide a computational cauchy outer boundary condition in various cases , ranging from 1 and 2 dimensional simulations @xcite to 3-dimensional simulations that include @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "a slight modification allows changing an outgoing null formalism ( and its evolution code ) to an ingoing one .",
    "this is briefly reviewed in sec .",
    "[ sec : null ] . by matching cauchy and characteristic algorithms at both an inner and outer boundary",
    ", the ability to include @xmath0 facilitates locating the true event horizon while excising an interior trapped region . in sec .",
    "[ sec : trapped ] , we discuss the problem of locating trapped surfaces on an ingoing null hypersurface . in sec .  [ sec : spherical ] , we present an implementation of these ideas to the global evolution of spherically symmetric , self gravitating scalar waves propagating in a black hole spacetime . in this case , the performance of the matching approach equals that of previous cauchy - only schemes that have been applied to this problem @xcite .",
    "we introduce a unified formalism for coordinates based upon either ingoing or outgoing null hypersurfaces .",
    "let @xmath4 label these hypersurfaces , @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , be labels for the null rays and @xmath7 be a surface area distance . in the resulting @xmath8 coordinates , the metric has the bondi - sachs form  @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 , with @xmath11 a unit sphere metric . in the outgoing case ,",
    "writing @xmath12 , it is convenient to express the metric variables in the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "this yields the standard outgoing null coordinate version of the minkowski metric by setting @xmath15 . in the ingoing case ,",
    "writing @xmath16 , the only component of the minkowski metric which differs is @xmath17 .",
    "this can be effected by the substitution @xmath18 in the outgoing form of the metric .",
    "the substitution ( [ eq : betasub ] ) can also be used in the curved space case to switch from outgoing to ingoing coordinates , in which case it is equivalent to an imaginary shift in the integration constant for the einstein equation determining @xmath19 ( see equation ( [ eq : beta ] ) below ) .",
    "this leads to the ingoing version of the metric @xmath20 of course , at a given space - time point the values of the coordinates @xmath7 and @xmath5 and the metric quantities @xmath19 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are not the same in the ingoing and outgoing cases ; but since we do not consider transformations between outgoing and ingoing coordinates there is no need to introduce any special notation to distinguish between them .",
    "this same substitution also provides a simple switch from the outgoing to the ingoing version of einstein equations @xmath24 written in null coordinates .",
    "this is consistent because @xmath19 contains a free integration constant which can be chosen to be complex ( as long as it leads to a real metric ) . in order to see how this works consider the outgoing version of the null hypersurface equations  @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the covariant derivative and @xmath27 the curvature scalar of the 2-metric @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath19-equation ( [ eq : beta ] ) allows the substitution ( [ eq : betasub ] ) to be regarded as a change in integration constant .",
    "then carrying out this substitution in equations ( [ eq : beta])-([eq : v ] ) leads to the ingoing version of the null hypersurface equations : @xmath28 this formal substitution also applies to the dynamical equations and provides a simple means to switch between evolution algorithms based upon ingoing and outgoing null cones .",
    "as we have already noted , although the same coordinate labels @xmath7 and @xmath5 are used for notational simplicity in both the outgoing metric ( [ eq : umet ] ) and the ingoing metric ( [ eq : vmet ] ) , they represent different fields .",
    "an exception occurs for spherical symmetry where the the surface area coordinate @xmath7 can be defined uniquely in terms of the same 2-spheres of symmetry used in both the ingoing and the outgoing coordinates . in this case , the spacelike or timelike character of the @xmath29 hypersurfaces is consistent under the substitution ( [ eq : betasub ] ) because the change involved in going from ( [ eq : v ] ) to ( [ eq : iv ] ) implies that @xmath22 changes sign in switching from outgoing to ingoing coordinates . as a result we obtain a consistent value for @xmath30 , with the @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) sign holding for outgoing ( ingoing ) coordinates .    in the absence of spherical symmetry , the surface area",
    "coordinate @xmath7 used in the bondi - sachs formalism has a gauge ambiguity associated with the changes in ray labels @xmath33 , under which it transforms as a scalar density . on any null hypersurface with a preferred compact spacelike slice @xmath34 ,",
    "this coordinate freedom in @xmath7 may be fixed by requiring that @xmath29 on @xmath34 .",
    "this then determines a unique @xmath29 foliation on either the ingoing or outgoing null hypersurface emanating from @xmath34 .",
    "cauchy - characteristic matching can be used to replace artificial boundary conditions which are otherwise necessary at the outer boundary of a finite cauchy domain .",
    "the exterior characteristic evolution can then be extended to null infinity to form a globally well - posed initial value problem . in tests of nonlinear 3-dimensional scalar waves ,",
    "cauchy - characteristic matching dramatically outperforms the best available artificial boundary condition both in accuracy and computational efficiency @xcite .",
    "we now describe how this matching strategy can be used at the inner boundary of a cauchy evolution which is joined to an ingoing null evolution . on the initial cauchy hypersurface , denoted by time @xmath35 ,",
    "let @xmath34 be a ( topological ) 2-sphere forming the inner boundary of the region being evolved by cauchy evolution .",
    "let @xmath36 represent the future evolution of @xmath34 under the flow of the vector field @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the unit vector field normal to the cauchy hypersurfaces @xmath39 and @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the lapse and shift .",
    "given the initial cauchy data on @xmath35 , boundary data must be given on the world tube @xmath36 in order to determine its future evolution .",
    "the cauchy hypersurfaces foliate this world tube into spheres @xmath42 .",

    "this inner boundary plays a role analogous to an apparent horizon inner boundary in a pure cauchy evolution .",
    "the region inside @xmath47 is causally disjoint from the domain of dependence which is evolved from the initial data . in the implementation of this strategy in the model spherically symmetric problem of sec .",

    "is necessary to choose initial data which guarantees black hole formation .",
    "such data can be obtained from initial cauchy data on @xmath35 for a black hole .",
    "however , rather than extending the cauchy hypersurface inward to the apparent horizon it could instead be truncated at an initial matching surface @xmath34 located sufficiently far outside the apparent horizon to avoid computational problems with the cauchy evolution .",
    "the initial cauchy data would then be extended into the interior of @xmath34 as null data on @xmath45 until a trapping boundary is reached .",
    "two ingredients are essential in order to arrange this .",
    "first , @xmath34 must be chosen to be convex , in the sense that its outward null normals uniformly diverge and its inner null normals uniformly converge . given any physically reasonable matter source",
    ", the focusing theorem then guarantees that the null hypersurface @xmath45 emanating inward from @xmath34 continues to converge until reaching a caustic .",
    "second , initial null data must be found which leads to trapped surfaces on @xmath45 before such a caustic is encountered .",
    "the existence of trapped surfaces depends upon the divergence of the outward normals to slices of @xmath45 .",
    "given the appropriate choice of @xmath34 the existence of such null data is guaranteed by the evolution of the extended cauchy problem .",
    "however , it is not necessary to actually carry out such a cauchy evolution to determine this null data .",
    "it is the data on @xmath34 which is most critical in determining whether a black hole can form .",

    "( see sec .",
    "[ sec : spherical ] ) , if @xmath34 has sufficient trapping gravity to form a trapped surface on @xmath45 in the absence of scalar waves crossing @xmath45 then a trapped surface also forms in the presence of scalar waves . in the absence of symmetry , this suggests that given appropriate initial cauchy data for horizon formation that the simplest and perhaps physically most relevant initial null data for a black hole would correspond to no gravitational waves crossing @xmath45 .",

    "however , we can construct a coordinate transformation which is valid everywhere on the world tube . to do this , we start with a general , differential coordinate transformation , whose unknown function @xmath148 is to be determined from the matching conditions : @xmath149    to keep the notation simpler , we will write the cauchy metric as @xmath150 inverting ( [ eq : gentr ] ) and substituting , we get @xmath151    on the world tube , we require @xmath152 .",
    "thus , we set @xmath153 . for the metric , we get @xmath154    the condition that the @xmath7-direction be null implies that @xmath155 upon substitution of the ief metric functions , this determines that @xmath156    the matching conditions are then @xmath157 } \\\\ \\label{eq : vout } v & = & r \\frac{1 - 2\\tilde{\\beta } } { 1- \\tilde{\\beta } } \\\\ \\label{eq : tbetaout } \\tilde{\\beta } & = & \\frac{v - r}{v-2r } \\\\ \\label{eq : taout } \\tilde{a } & = & e^\\beta \\sqrt{2 - v / r}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      as is typical with finite difference calculations , the continuum functions are discretized spatially and placed on grids with @xmath158 points . in our case we have three regions .",
    "the inner - null variables are placed on grids with @xmath159 points , the cauchy variables on grids with @xmath160 points , and the outer - null variables on grids with @xmath161 points . on each grid ,",
    "the spatial index @xmath162 runs from @xmath163 to @xmath159 , @xmath160 or @xmath161 , respectively , with @xmath163 representing the smallest @xmath7 value .",
    "= 3.2 in    in addition to the spatial discretization , each function needs two or more time levels . while both the cauchy and null evolution schemes use only two time levels , we keep an extra level in each to facilitate the matching . fig [ fig : inmatch ] shows how the finite difference grids match at the inner world tube .",
    "the two grids are aligned in both @xmath7 and @xmath124 .",
    "this means no interpolations are necessary .",
    "the world tube is at @xmath164 on the cauchy grid and @xmath165 on the ingoing null grid .",
    "the cauchy variables need boundary values on time level @xmath166 at @xmath164 .",
    "the metric values come from the null variables at level @xmath166 , with @xmath165 , using the transformation equations ( [ eq : tbetain ] ) and ( [ eq : tain ] ) .",
    "these relations are algebraic and straightforward to implement .",
    "boundary values for the extrinsic curvature components come from equations ( [ eq : kttdef ] ) and ( [ eq : krrdef ] ) .",
    "@xmath167 is computed algebraically and @xmath168 is computed using second - order , centered - in - time , forward - in - space derivatives in the cauchy grid .",
    "the transformation of the scalar field requires transforming derivatives between the two coordinate patches . at the world tube ,",
    "the relationships among the derivatives are @xmath169 these lead to the following equations for @xmath170 and @xmath171 : @xmath172 and @xmath173    the null variables need boundary values at @xmath174 , @xmath175 .",
    "the metric values come from the cauchy variables at level @xmath176 , with @xmath177 , using ( [ eq : betain ] ) and ( [ eq : vin ] ) .",
    "the evolution equation for @xmath178 at the world tube is @xmath179.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    = 3.2 in    the situation at the outer world tube is shown in fig [ fig : outmatch ] . here",
    ", the grids align in space at two values of @xmath7 but in time only at the world tube .",
    "the cauchy metric boundary values at @xmath180 come directly from the null variables at @xmath177 using the transformation equations ( [ eq : tbetaout ] ) and ( [ eq : taout ] ) .",
    "since the grids do nt align in time as they do at the inner world tube , we use a different procedure for the scalar field boundary values .",
    "we use the derivative transformation @xmath181 to get an evolution equation for @xmath134 at the world tube .",
    "we then set @xmath170 and @xmath171 using their definitions ( [ eq : defphi ] ) and backward second - order derivatives .",
    "the boundary values for the null variables must be interpolated in time using the cauchy variables at @xmath176 and @xmath182 . given values for a function @xmath183 at time levels @xmath176 and @xmath182",
    ", we can get its value @xmath184 at the beginning of the null cone using @xmath185 notice that this expression requires a value for @xmath186 at level @xmath174 , something that wo nt be known until the next time step .",
    "we have found it sufficient to extrapolate from the previous time levels using @xmath187    thus , to get values for @xmath19 and @xmath22 we use the matching conditions ( [ eq : betaout ] ) and ( [ eq : vout ] ) along with the above interpolation .",
    "for the scalar field , we interpolate the value of @xmath178 from the cauchy grid , using @xmath188 .    the apparent horizon is found on the ingoing null cones using the apparent horizon equation which reduces simply to @xmath94 . when the scalar field passes into the black hole , the horizon grows outward and we simply stop evolving the grid points that are now inside .      to evaluate the performance of this approach ,",
    "we compare it to a second order accurate , purely cauchy evolution in ief coordinates , as presented in @xcite .",
    "for the comparison shown here , we place the outer boundary of the cauchy evolution at @xmath189 and evolve to @xmath190 to prevent any outer boundary effects from influencing the comparison .",
    "the scalar field pulse is centered at @xmath191 and has a mass of @xmath192 .",
    "fig [ fig : converg ] shows the mutual convergence between the cauchy variables in the two codes .",
    "this demonstrates that the two programs are solving the same problem , and provides evidence that the matching approach generates the correct spacetime .",
    "= 3.2 in    the reason that the convergence rate appears to drop to first order when the scalar field hits the horizon is an artifact arising from the motion of the horizon .",
    "as mass falls into the hole , there is a critical amount which causes the horizon to move out by one grid point .",
    "if at the coarsest resolution the horizon moves a distance @xmath193 then on the next finer grid it only moves by @xmath194 , and so on .",
    "thus , at different resolutions , the black holes have slightly different locations .",
    "the resulting shift in the location of the inner boundary causes convergence between successively finer numerical solutions to drop from second order to first order .",
    "this is an unavoidable diagnostic effect due to the comparison of numerical solutions .",
    "we believe that the numerical solution would converge at second order to an exact solution of the physical problem .",
    "no exact solutions are known to use for a check of this , but for a weak scalar field the horizon does not move and we do measure second order convergence throughout the evolution .",
    "further , we see the same convergence order drop for strong fields in cauchy - only or null - only evolutions , and thus are certain it is not due to the matching procedure .",
    "our work shows that the matching approach provides as good a solution to the black hole excision problem in spherical symmetry as previous treatments @xcite .",
    "it also has some advantages over the pure cauchy approach , namely , it is computationally more efficient ( fewer variables ) , and is much easier to implement .",
    "we achieved a stable evolution simply by transforming the outgoing - null evolution scheme to work on ingoing null cones , and implementing it .",
    "achieving stability with a purely cauchy scheme in the region of the apparent horizon is trickier , involving much trial and error in choosing difference schemes .",
    "it should be noted , however , that implementing the matching may be tricky , especially in higher dimensions .",
    "whether it is easier than implementing cauchy differencing near the horizon remains to be seen .",
    "also , using the ingoing null formulation , we have achieved the stable evolution of a schwarzschild black hole in 3-dimensions ( the details will be presented elsewhere ) and are working on rotating and moving black holes .",
    "long term stable evolution of a 3d black hole has yet to be demonstrated with a cauchy evolution .",
