    "poincar and heisenberg algebras , supplemented by the principle of local gauge invariance , play a pivotal and defining role in the formulation and foundations of modern physics . if i do not invoke equivalence principle directly it is because , following steven weinberg , i take the view that poincar spacetime symmetries , in conjunction with heisenberg algebra , not only define the notion of point particle but also suggest the equality of the inertial and gravitational masses .",
    "@xcite@xcite    seen in this light , irrespective of one s preference for a candidate theory of quantum gravity , or , the theory of everything , a general question that may be asked is as to what extent the poincar and heisenberg algebras remain undeformed at the interface of gravitational and quantum realms ( ` igqr ` ) .",
    "further , as a secondary question , as to what extent the notion of point particle becomes untenable in any such deformation .",
    "the answer to these questions has a direct impact on the conceptual and internally consistent formulation of any quantum theory of gravity .",
    "for instance , a consistent lorentz - covariant quantum theory of strings requires not only gravity but it carries the advantage that short distance divergences of the field theory no longer exist . while this is far from a trivial justification in favor of abandoning the notion of point particle,@xcite it would be desirable to provide a deeper first - principle reason for doing so .",
    "in addition , it may have direct implication on how theories of extended objects are formulated , or how other quantum gravity programs are implemented .",
    "the setting thus presented can not but leave the reader with the expectation that perhaps an argument is now to be presented that poincar and heisenberg algebras must suffer a deformation at ` igqr ` .",
    "indeed that is the case .",
    "but , as i hope to argue below , the deformation arises not as an ad hoc suggestion but is based on a principle that requires lie algebraic stability as a minimal requirement for any physically - viable algebra .",
    "concurrently with this circumstance there exists yet another problem which challenges the underlying poincar - heisenberg algebraic structure of the standard quantum field theory .",
    "the latter predicts that each quantum field carries a non - vanishing zero point energy and that for the standard model fields these quantum fluctuations do not cancel .",
    "this result is deeply intertwined with the underlying poincar - heisenberg algebra .    to make the statement of the problem explicit , recall and consider@xcite an effective field theory that takes into account only degrees of freedom with energies below about @xmath0 , with all higher energy radiative corrections buried in corrections to various parameters in the effective lagrangian . in this effective field theory , the all - pervading cosmic vacuum energy density , that serves to explain the recently inferred cosmic acceleration ,",
    "@xcite may be symbolically written as _",
    "vac = = where @xmath1 is the cosmological constant and the sum symbolizes , ( a ) contribution of all zero point energies in the fields of the effective field theory ( with due regard for the sign for fermionic and bosonic fields ) , and ( b ) it is cut off at particle energies equal to roughly @xmath0 . in units with @xmath2",
    ", we have ( 100)^4 .",
    "however , observations do not allow @xmath3 to be significantly greater than the critical density @xmath4 ; or , equivalently @xmath5 .",
    "this mismatch of fifty - six orders of magnitude ( in these units ) is called the _ cosmological constant problem _ and may be interpreted as an outstanding failure of the poincar - heisenberg lie algebraic structure of the standard model of particle physics .",
    "it goes without saying that any well - motivated deformation of the poincar - heisenberg algebra may have a direct impact on the cosmological constant problem .",
    "this situation is made even more intriguing by the fact that there exists a coincidence between the observed cosmic vacuum energy density @xmath3 and the neutrino masses.@xcite      that the discordance manifests itself so dramatically in an otherwise successful model of particle physics thus becomes a problem in itself . within the context of this essay the answer resides in the fact that the lie algebraic stability leaves the lorentz sector intact , while introducing modifications via length scales which are either unaccessible at low energies , or carry cosmological dimensions .",
    "first , in all successful physical theories lie algebras have played a pivotal role in defining the fundamental notion of _ particle _ and its evolution . secondly , as emphasized by chryssomalakos,@xcite lie algebras naturally divide themselves in two classes . those which are _ stable _ and those which are _",
    "unstable_. under infinitesimal perturbations in their structure constants , the former are isomorphic to all lie algebras in their vicinity , while the latter are not .",
    "following vilela mendes@xcite and chryssomalakos , @xcite i here suggest that the immunity to infinitesimal perturbations in the structure constants of a physically - relevant lie algebra should be raised to the status of a principle .",
    "the reason for this suggestion lies in the fact that , in retrospect , the quantum and relativistic revolutions can be seen as to have been born from a unifying lie - algebraic stability theme .",
    "that is , quantum and relativistic frameworks correspond to the lie - algebraic stabilization of the algebras underlying the classical mechanics and galilean relativity . by promoting the lie algebraic stability to a principle ,",
    "side by side , say , the principle of local gauge covariance , one hopes that a bewildering set of possibilities that a theorist encounters can be further narrowed .",
    "i hasten to add that this is not an abstract idea , but a paradigm which relies on physical and mathematical robustness of the underlying algebraic structures .",
    "that only such robust frameworks have a chance of describing physical reality follows if one one wishes to avoid various fine tuning problems which can ultimately , and often , be traced back to stability versus instability of the underlying lie algebras .",
    "stability , i then conjecture , equates to absence of a fine tuning in a physical theory .",
    "in the standard general relativistic and quantum framework , a freely falling frame at the ` igqr ` carries the poincar - heisenberg algebra . within this framework",
    "while the position and momentum derive their operational meaning from the fundamental commutator @xmath6 = i \\hbar$ ] , @xmath7 , the _ vanishing _ commutators for the operators associated with position allow an uncertainty - free ( @xmath8 ) specification of an event .",
    "this underlies the operational framework for the notion of a point particle .    at the same time , as is apparent from the work of wigner , see , e.g. , ref .",
    ", the poincar spacetime symmetries provide kinematical wave equations which describe the world lines of these point particles .",
    "the quantum aspect is then implemented by    1 .   using the kinematical wave equation to define a lagrangian density , 2 .   interpreting the functions on which the wave operators act as field operators , and by imposing heisenberg s fundamental commutators / anticommutators for bosonic / fermionic fields and",
    "the lagrangian - density implied canonical momenta , and 3 .   introducing interactions by invoking form covariance of the lagrangian density under a suitable spacetime - dependent phase transformations of the involved fields .",
    "the simplest of these being a local , i.e. spacetime - dependent , @xmath9 transformation which introduces a massless vector field and results in quantum electrodynamics .    at the classical level",
    "the effects of a background gravitational field are then incorporated by demanding form covariance of these wave equations under general co - ordinate transformations . in making these transformations the flat spacetime metric",
    "is replaced by appropriate metric compatible with energy - momentum density associated with the gravitational background .",
    "if one now studies a weak - field and non - relativistic limit of these wave equations ( with a background gravitational field ) , and finally invokes ehrenfest limit , then one verifies that inertial and gravitational masses indeed cancel out from equations of motion .",
    "otherwise , the mass - dependence of test particle survives in the wave equations and results in either gravitationally - induced bohm - aharonov like effects , or gravitational redshift of flavor oscillation clocks for neutrinos.@xcite@xcite    while these latter effects may be seen as an implication of the equivalence principle at ` igqr ` beyond its original `` @xmath10 '' formulation , the historically - assumed mass - independence of the equations of motion no longer survives .",
    "this circumstance , for the case of neutron interferometry , was verified in the classic 1975 experiment of colella , overhauser , and werner;@xcite and it continues to inspire similar experiments to probe ` igqr`@xcite .",
    "part in @xmath11 level.@xcite this discrepancy , to the best of my knowledge , remains unexplained.@xcite the fact that no similar signal is seen for the violation of equivalence principle in atomic interferometry by the stanford group of chu,@xcite raises the possibility that   despite the unexpectedly large violation of the equivalence principle   this may be a quantum gravity effect which manifests itself only for polarized particles .",
    "such a possibility naturally occurs in the proposal of corichi and sudarsky.@xcite if the corichi and sudarsky s phenomenological proposal is indeed at the origin of the unexpected discrepancy ( provided one is able to reconcile the unexpectedly large violation of the equivalence principle ) , then apart from offering a possibility for new laboratory experiments in quantum gravity , it may have important physical consequences for neutron stars . ]    while the just summarized observations speak of the great strength quantum and relativistic frameworks embody at ` igqr ` , troubles arise not only at well - known attempts to quantize gravity but also in the following two facts : ( a ) when _ gedanken _ experiments incorporate gravitational effects into position measurements the operators associated with the latter cease to commute@xcite ; and , ( b ) the poincar - heisenberg algebra at ` igqr ` induces _",
    "irremovable _ and _ intrinsic _ zero - point energy in freely falling frames .",
    "this , implies an intrinsic element of curvature , i.e. , gravity , in freely falling frames.@xcite these observations become even more intriguing when , in the absence of gravity , sivasubramanian _ _ et al.__@xcite arrive at non - commutative geometry for position measurements of polarized photons .    within the framework of the paradigm proposed in this essay",
    ", the above remarks suggest to question validity of the poincar - heisenberg algebra at ` igqr ` .",
    "specifically , the paradigm of lie algebraic stability suggests that the problem of constructing a theory of quantum gravity may lie in the fact that poincar and heisenberg algebras cease to be adequate enough at ` igqr ` .",
    "recent physics literature contains numerous efforts to attend to this suspicion .",
    "however , with the exception of the 1994 work of vilela mendes@xcite ( and a few important works cited therein ) essentially all the attempts fail to arise from some deeper universal principle .",
    "the way vilela mendes avoids the _ ad hoc _ element in his proposal is to discover , and point out , that    1 .",
    "conceptually , the quantum and relativistic revolutions of the twentieth century can be viewed as lie - algebraic stabilization of the algebras underlying the classical mechanics and galilean relativity .",
    "modulo minor technical remarks , the poincar and heisenberg algebras , _ separately _ , are endowed with lie algebraic stability .",
    "it was first realized by faddeev .",
    "@xcite 2 .",
    "the _ combined _ poincar - heisenberg algebra lacks lie algebraic stability .    having done that , vilela mendes then proceeded to present a stabilized form of the poincar - heisenberg algebra .",
    "the _ uniqueness _ of the vilela mendes proposal , with additional elements and insights , was demonstrated in the winter of 2004 by chryssomalakos and okon.@xcite this circumstance raised the lie - algebraic stability from a suggestion to a new testable principle .",

    "the other length scale can be taken as @xmath25 , with @xmath1 being the cosmological constant , and @xmath26 is the vacuum energy density presumably arising from the ( modified)zero - point energies of various field . in the process , the underlying algebra unifies the extreme microscopic ( i.e , planck / unification realm ) and the extreme macroscopic ( i.e. cosmological scale ) .",
    "for reasons underling these specifications , see refs",
    ".  . may in fact be much larger than that which appears `` natural . ''",
    "that is , @xmath22 may be significantly less than @xmath27 and it need not be identified with a unification scale . in addition , it may depend on the particle species which probe the spacetime non - commutativity .",
    "for instance , spacetime as seen by a photon , and as that probed by a graviton , may not coincide ( except perhaps in some averaged sense ) .",
    "] second , there exists a new dimensionless constant @xmath28 .",
    "third , existence of @xmath29 which ceases to be central .",
    "for the purposes of this essay , and to hint at the conceptual and predictive strength of the principle of lie algebraic stability , i now discuss two issues .",
    "the first one concerns the notion of point particle ( and associated questions and observations ) , while the second is a preliminary study on the implications for the cosmological constant problem .",
    "the fact that the heisenberg s fundamental commutator ( [ eq : hfc ] ) undergoes non - trivial modifications with @xmath29 ceasing to be central , and @xmath30 , has the following immediately identifiable consequence : the position - momentum heisenberg uncertainty relations get modified .",

    "_ modification to wave - particle duality  _ since now @xmath61 , the considerations found in refs .   and   suggest a fundamental modification to the wave - particle duality .",

    "it s interpretation as space - time coordinates lacks the required primitive nature for lie algebra generators , as noted by chryssomalakos and okon.@xcite 3 .   _ configuration - space wave equations  _ if one assumes that the boost parameter , in the notation of ref .",
    ", remains unchanged .",
    "but , i see no reason that the dispersion relation itself should not suffer a modification . ]",
    "@xmath68 then , the momentum - space wave equations for the ` spha ` remain intact , but their configuration - space form depend on ( a ) resolution of the question just enumerated , and ( b ) the precise conceptual understanding and form of @xmath69 as a differential operator which solves the ` spha ` .",
    "lagrangian density , and quantization rules  _ the answer to the above question guides to write down the quantum field operator , to obtain the lagrangian density ( note it immediately follows once `` configuration space '' wave equation is known ) , and to define @xmath12 and @xmath69 , and perhaps @xmath67 and @xmath29 , in terms of the field operator .",
    "the quantization rules may then be obtained by demanding that the resulting objects satisfy the ` spha ` .",
    "discrete symmetries  _ how are the notions of charge conjugation , parity , and time reversal defined .",
    "is the theory symmetric under modified form of these symmetries ?",
    "answer to this question , e.g. , carries relevance to the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry in the universe .",
    "6 .   _ s - matrix  _ what is the associated s - matrix structure ? 7 .",
    "_ equivalence principle  _ do the notions of inertial and gravitational masses undergo any change ?",
    "this question can be examined by concurrently studying the non - relativistic and ehrenfest limit of the `` configuration space '' wave equations and by repeating the 1964 analysis of ref .   in the new context .",
    "the cosmological constant problem and the zero point energy for bosonic and fermionic field are directly related , and rest on poincar and heisenberg algebras . in order to define the impact of the lie algebraic stabilization on the cosmological constant problem it is first helpful to add a few brief comments .",

    "the spacetime is assumed to be commutative . in transition from quantum mechanics of point particles , to a relativistic quantum field describing point particles , instead of requiring @xmath6=i\\hbar$ ] ( with commutative spacetime ) , one now imposes the same relations , with right hand side now being a dirac delta function , @xmath75 , or zero ( for field - field , and momentum - momentum , commutators ) , and @xmath76 , the field , while @xmath77 , with the latter representing the canonically conjugate momentum associated with @xmath78 ; and further replacing the commutator by anticommuator if the field is fermionic . for the standard model fields ,",
    "each of the the fermionic fields , as is well known , is found to carry a zero point energy of @xmath79 , while each of the bosonic fields carries @xmath80 , for each mode of angular frequency @xmath81 .",
    "the cosmological constant problem arises because for the standard model fields the bosonic and fermionic contributions do not cancel , and because these contributions when summed over all accessible energies , up to a cut off , give a result which violently disagrees with observational data .",
    "naively , one may begin with @xmath72 , considered above , for the simple harmonic oscillator .",

    "the zero point energy @xmath89 remains close to @xmath90 .",

    "the result ( [ eq : hpsho ] ) is in sharp contrast to the _ unstable _ form of poincar - heisenberg where high angular frequencies result in increasingly higher contributions to the zero point energy .",
    "it is quite clear that the preliminary considerations presented here point towards dramatic softening , if not the complete resolution , of the cosmological constant problem .",
    "a stronger claim can not be made because such an analysis is too naive .",
    "for one thing , there is no reason to believe that the form of @xmath72 remains valid when the underlying spacetime is no longer commutative .",
    "more importantly , one has no unique guiding principle to define as to what one means by a simple harmonic oscillator for the latter circumstance . to bypass this problem ,",
    "it is advisable that heuristic argument given here serve only as a motivation to look at the spectrum of free bosonic and fermionic fields as they exist for ( yet to be developed)quantum fields based on ` spha ` .    if the naive result contained in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hpsho ] )    1 .",
    "is essentially confirmed by a rigorous analysis of the quantum fields based on ` spha ` , and if it 2 .",
    "captures the essence of the exact result    then for heavy particles , @xmath84 approaches @xmath92 faster than that compared with light particles .",
    "therefore , the dominant contribution comes to the cosmological constant from the lightest particles in the standard model , i.e. , the neutrinos of the fermionic sector and the photons of the bosonic sector .",
    "furthermore , for massive particles this contribution comes not from the angular frequencies @xmath97 , but from the lower spectrum of angular frequencies .",
    "it may underlie the observation that the vacuum energy density associated with @xmath1 is of the same order as that of neutrinos .",
    "specifically , the coincidence between @xmath98 and neutrino masses as suggested by the atmospheric and solar neutrino data , see e.g. refs .   and , acquires a plausible first - principle explanation in the just outlined scenario .",
    "within the framework of the standard model of particle physics , the cosmological constant problem poses a dramatic discordance between reality and prediction . the ` spha ` , summarized in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : a1])-([eq : a2 ] ) , offers the next logical step towards extension of the standard model in ` igqr ` without spoiling any of its grand successes . in the process",
    "it offers a well - defined departure from the notion of point particle where an event carries a minimal spatio - temporal extent .",
    "the latter depends on the representation space to which the event belongs .    at this early stage",
    "it is difficult to assert with any confidence if ` spha ` is indeed the next approximation to the physically - realized algebraic structure over which to extend the standard model of particle physics ( and which incorporates gravity in its quantum nature ) .",

    "<S> chryssomalakos and okon , through a uniqueness analysis , have strengthened the vilela mendes suggestion that the immunity to infinitesimal perturbations in the structure constants of a physically - relevant lie algebra should be raised to the status of a physical principle . since the poincar - heisenberg algebra does not carry the indicated immunity it is suggested that the lie algebra for the interface of the gravitational and quantum realms ( ` igqr ` ) </S>",
    "<S> is its stabilized form . </S>",
    "<S> it carries three additional parameters : a length scale pertaining to the planck / unification scale , a second length scale associated with cosmos , and a new dimensionless constant . </S>",
    "<S> here , i show that the adoption of the stabilized poincar - heisenberg algebra ( ` spha ` ) for the ` igqr ` has the immediate implication that ` point particle ' ceases to be a viable physical notion . </S>",
    "<S> it must be replaced by objects which carry a well - defined , representation space dependent , minimal spatio - temporal extent . </S>",
    "<S> the ensuing implications have the potential , without spoiling any of the successes of the standard model of particle physics , to resolve the cosmological constant problem while concurrently offering a first - principle hint as to why there exists a coincidence between cosmic vacuum energy density and neutrino masses . </S>",
    "<S> the main theses which the essay presents is the following : an extension of the present - day physics to a framework which respects ` spha ` should be seen as the most natural and systematic path towards gaining a deeper understanding of outstanding questions , if not providing answers to them .     </S>"
