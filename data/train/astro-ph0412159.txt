    "statistical studies of the pulse - width in mean profiles of radio pulsars are an important tool for investigations of the pulsar radiation geometry .",
    "one especially important parameter that can be derived from such studies is the inclination angle between the magnetic and the spin pulsar axes .",
    "early studies were carried out by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "since the amount of the available data was small , these papers suffered from problems of small number statistics .",
    "a more complete work was performed by @xcite and @xcite , who analyzed samples of about 200 pulse - width data measured near 400 mhz .",
    "although the database used in these papers was quite rich , the pulse - width measurements were contaminated by the interstellar scattering dominating at low radio frequencies .",
    "more recently ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gh96 hereafter ) compiled a new database of 242 pulse - widths @xmath2 ( corresponding to about 10% of the maximum intensity ) measured at a higher radio frequency ( near 1.4 ghz ) , which was relatively unbiased as compared with the lower frequency data .",
    "gh96 used their pulse - width database to perform monte carlo simulations in an attempt to derive the distribution statistics of pulsar periods , pulse widths , magnetic inclination angles and rates of the interpulse occurrence .",
    "they concluded by comparing the simulated and observed ( or observationally derived ) quantities that the observed distribution of the inclination angles resembles the sine function following from the flat ( random ) distribution in the parent population , and that the probability ( beaming fraction ) of observing a pulsar was about 0.16 .",
    "gh96 also pointed out that the rates of interpulse occurrence should be considered as an important aspect of pulsar population studies .    on the other hand , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* henceforth tm98 ) using a different method based on an analysis of the indirectly derived polarization position angles and magnetic inclination angles concluded that the observed distribution of the latter is cosine - like rather than the sine - like suggested by gh96 .",
    "they also obtained the beaming factor @xmath3 , considerably lower than 0.16 obtained by gh96 .",
    "tm98 pointed out a likely source of this discrepancy , namely the incorrect assumption used by gh96 that the observed distribution and the parent distribution of pulsar periods are similar .",
    "recently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* henceforth zjm03 ) followed the monte - carlo simulation scheme developed by gh96 .",
    "zjm03 argued that both the parent distribution function and the observed distribution of pulsar periods can be modelled by the gamma function but with different values of free parameters , and their monte - carlo simulations included searching for a 2-d grid of these parameters . as a result",
    ", zjm03 concluded that indeed the cosine - like distribution ( suggested by tm98 ) is a much more suitable to model the inclination angles in the parent pulsar population than the flat distribution ( suggested by gh96 ) .",
    "they argued that a most plausible parent distribution is a modified cosine function , which has a peak around @xmath4 and another weaker peak near @xmath5 .",
    "they also obtained the beaming factor @xmath6 , consistent with the result of tm98 .",
    "as emphasized by zjm03 in the conclusions of their paper , neither these authors nor tm98 considered potentially important constraints related to the observable interpulse emission .",
    "although gh96 did consider the issue of interpulse emission , but their estimate of rates of occurrence was not quite correct ( see  3.4 in this paper ) .",
    "moreover , their statistical analysis was biased by incorrect assumption mentioned above concerning parent distribution of pulsar period . in this work",
    "we follow the simulation scheme of zjm03 but we include the actual rates of interpulse occurrences . we demonstrate that a pure cosine distribution of the magnetic inclination angles generates much too few interpulses as compared with observations and should be rejected as a plausible distribution function .",
    "we found that the modified cosine function of zjm03 ( see eq .  [ 9 ] ) is much better in this respect , mainly because of the weak second maximum near @xmath1 .",
    "both the above distribution functions can reproduce the observed distributions of pulse - widths , pulsar periods and inclination angles almost equally well , and thus the observed interpulse statistics provides the most restrictive constraint discriminating between different trial distribution functions .",
    "it is generally accepted that the pulsar radio emission is relativistically beamed along the open dipolar field lines ( to within @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the lorentz factor of the emitting sources ) .",
    "thus , the pulse width @xmath2 at the level of 10% of the maximum profile intensity can be written as w_10=4\\{}^1/2 [ w10 ] @xcite , where @xmath9 is the beam - width corresponding to 10% intensity level , @xmath10 is the inclination angle of the magnetic axis to the spin axis , @xmath11 is the impact angle of the closest approach of the line - of - sight to the magnetic axis , and thus @xmath12 is the observer angle between the spin axis and the line - of - sight .",
    "it is worth noting that equation  ( [ w10 ] ) assumes the symmetry of a pulsar beam with respect to the fiducial plane containing both the spin and the magnetic pulsar axes .",
    "thus , the appropriate pulse widths database should contain only pulsars with symmetrical profiles for which @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the pulse longitude measured from the fiducial phase corresponding to the fiducial plane ( e.g. gh96 ) .",
    "the opening angle of the radio beam ( beam - width ) corresponding to 10% intensity level can be derived from pulse width measurements @xmath2 ( and @xmath10 , @xmath11 values derived from the polarization data ) in the form of the so - called @xmath15 relation .",
    "@xcite obtained @xmath16 for the pulse - width data at 408 mhz , which scaled to 1.4 ghz writes _",
    "105.^8p^-0.33 [ ro10 ] .",
    "however , @xcite reanalyzed the same data sample and concluded that _ 105.^6p^-0.5 .",
    "[ ro10bis ]    @xcite analyzed a large number of available pulse - width data interpolated to the frequency @xmath17  ghz and obtained a bimodal distribution of the opening angles .",
    "this result was later confirmed at frequency @xmath18  ghz by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gks93 henceforth ) and independently by @xcite and the resulting @xmath15 relation reads _",
    "10=\\ {    l 6.^3 p^-0.5 , + 4.^9 p^-0.5 ,    .",
    "[ ro10bisbis ] with smaller angles preferred at shorter periods .",
    "gks93 argued that @xmath19 is preferred in 80% of pulsars with @xmath20  s , and this constraint was used by gh96 ( their table  2 ) , while zjm03 used @xmath19 for @xmath20  s and @xmath21 for other periods ( their table  1 ) .",
    "we denote the former option by equation  ( 4a ) and the latter one by equation  ( 4b ) in table  2 .",
    "it is worth noticing that @xmath15 relations expressed by equations  ( [ ro10])-([ro10bisbis ] ) are , to some extent , equivalent .",
    "in fact , equation  ( [ ro10 ] ) seems to reflect the tendency of smaller angles being preferred at short periods in equation  ( [ ro10bisbis ] ) , and equation  ( [ ro10bis ] ) represents the average of both values appearing in equation  ( [ ro10bisbis ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , we use all the above relations in our simulation procedure ( section  4 ) .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that both the rotation axis and the observer s direction are randomly oriented in space .",
    "thus , the probability density function for the observer angle @xmath12 is f()=(+ ) .",
    "[ f ] however , the distribution of the inclination angle may depend on many unknown factors , and the most common probability density functions in the parent population of pulsars include the flat function f()= [ f2 ] for the random distribution , the sine function f()=[fsin ] for the sine - like distribution , and the cosine function f()=[fcos ] for the cosine - like distribution .",
    "one can consider some more complicated probability density functions .",
    "for example , zjm03 argued that the plausible parent distribution of the inclination angle can be described in the form f()=+ , [ fab ] where @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "this function has a weak local maximum near @xmath24 , which is an important feature with regard to the interpulse occurrence statistics .",
    "we test all the above functions in our monte carlo simulation procedure ( section 4 ) .",
    "gh96 demonstrated that the observed distribution of periods of 516 pulsars with @xmath25  s ( pulsar catalog * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can be well fitted by the gamma function f(p)=g_0x^a-1e^-x [ fp ] with @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 is the normalization constant dependent on @xmath30 .",
    "zjm03 used this function to fit the period distribution in a much larger sample of 1164 pulsar periods @xmath25  s and obtained @xmath31 and @xmath32 . although the parent distribution of periods is certainly different from the observed distribution , it is convenient to represent the former also in the form of a general gamma function ( eq .  [",
    "[ fp ] ] ) , with values of @xmath33 and @xmath30 treated as free model parameters that can be derived in 2-d grid search implemented into the monte carlo simulations ( section  4 ) .",
    "for a comparison one can also try some other trial probability density distribution functions , like the lorentzian distribution function f(p)= , [ fpl ] or even the gaussian distribution function f(p)=. [ fp1 ] again , the values of free parameters can be derived in 2-d grid search within the monte carlo simulations ( section  4 ) .      following the arguments given by @xcite and @xcite we first assume that the pulsar beam is circular or almost circular .",
    "if this is the case , then the detection condition ( see gh96 for details ) is : >",
    "|| [ ro ] for the typical main pulse ( mp ) emission .",
    "however , one should also include a rare interpulse ( ip ) emission , seen in a few percent of pulsars .",
    "two models were proposed to explain this emission occurring about 180 degrees of longitude from the centroid of the mp : the double pole ( dp - ip ) model , in which mp and ip originate from the opposite magnetic poles @xcite , and the single pole ( sp - ip ) , in which both mp and ip are associated with the same pole .",
    "the detection condition for dp - ip model is > -2-[ropi ] ( e.g. gh96 ) , which favors a nearly orthogonal rotators @xmath34 .",
    "both mp and ip in pulsars that belong to dp - ip class show relatively narrow duty cycles , contrary to the broad profiles in the sp - ip class associated with nearly aligned rotators @xmath35 .",
    "there are two possibilities within the sp - ip : in the first one the mp and the ip represent two cuts through one conical beam @xcite .",
    "the other possibility is when the line - of - sight stays in the overall pulsar beam for the entire pulsar period , so the mp and ip correspond to cuts through two nested conical beams @xcite .",
    "the detection conditions for these two versions of sp - ip models are > , [ ro2 ] and > 2+,[ro3 ] respectively .",
    "both these conditions are checked alternatively . one should mention that only the latter condition was used by gh96 , which resulted in too low rates of sp - ip as compared to observations .",
    "one can also consider a quite natural possibility that the pulsar beam has a tendency to a meridional compression , with the ratio of minor to major ellipse axes r [ r ] depending on the inclination angle @xcite .",
    "then the appropriate detection conditions ( generalizations of equations  [ [ ro]]-[[ro2 ] ] ) are : || < .[beta ] for the main pulse emission , rr>-2-[rr ] for the dp - ip emission , and rr>2+[rr2 ] or @xmath36 for the sp - ip emission , where r= [ r ] is the latitudinal beam dimension .",
    "note that @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the observationally deduced beam radius ( see gh96 for details ) .",
    "in our statistical analysis we compare the simulated distributions with the directly ( @xmath40 , ip occurrences ) or indirectly @xmath41 observed data by means of the kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s henceforth ) significance tests . using the numerical methods given by @xcite we compute the maximum distance @xmath42 ( maximum difference between cumulative distribution functions corresponding to the observed and simulated data sets ) as well as the significance @xmath43 of any non zero value of @xmath42 .",
    "the value of @xmath43 represents the probability that both the simulated and the observed data sets are drawn from the same parent distribution .",
    "we adopt an arbitrary criterion that @xmath44 for distributions of @xmath45 and @xmath10 at the same time .      using the available database of pulsar parameters we selected a sample of 1165 periods @xmath46 with @xmath47  s ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "we rejected all recycled and binary pulsars , since they represent different period and magnetic inclination angle populations than typical pulsars ( the recycled pulsar b1933 + 16 with @xmath48  s was also excluded ) .",
    "this sample of the observed pulsar periods can be fitted by the gamma function expressed by equation  ( [ fp ] ) with @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( see upper panel in fig .  1 ) .",
    "we use the database of 238 pulse - width measurements @xmath2 taken at the frequency of about 1.4 ghz ( upper panel in fig .",
    "2 ) , compiled by gh96 ( their table  1 and fig .  1 ) .",
    "these measurements were carefully selected from the available databases to satisfy all criterions imposed by the symmetry of equation  ( [ w10 ] ) , ( see comments below this equation and gh96 for more details ) .",
    "zmj03 demonstrated that another available database ( containing 265 pulsars ) of @xcite is equivalent to that of gh96 in the sense that the values of @xmath2 are roughly the same in both these databases .      while the values of @xmath2 and @xmath46 as well as the interpulse occurrences are direct observational quantities , the values of inclination angles @xmath10 can only be indirectly observed by means of the polarization measurements @xcite . following the arguments of zjm03 we used the database of the inclination angles compiled by @xcite .",
    "this database contains 149 measurements of the magnetic inclination angles , whose distribution is presented in the upper panel of fig .",
    "the fraction of interpulses in the observed sample of pulsars provides useful information about pulsar geometry ( see gh96 ) .",
    "however , the statistical studies of this phenomenon are difficult since the ratio of amplitudes of the interpulse to the main - pulse is often about 1% and varies with frequency @xcite .",
    "the only representative sample of interpulses can be found in table 6 of the catalog of 558 pulsars @xcite .",
    "there are 22 pulsars with interpulses @xmath51 in this sample , with only 3 certain cases ( b0826 - 34 , b0950 + 08 , b1929 + 10 ) corresponding to a single magnetic pole ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their fig",
    "most likely psr b1848 + 04 with very a broad main - pulse also belongs to this category .",
    "this corresponds to occurrence rates of about 3.4% and 0.5% for dp - ip and sp - ip , respectively .",
    "these rates were adopted as model values by gh96 .",
    "however , to be consistent with our selection of pulsar periods ( section  3.2 ) one should exclude millisecond and other recycled pulsars from both the total pulsar sample and from the sample of pulsars with interpulses .",
    "when this is done then the corresponding rates of occurrence are 2% and 0.8% for dp - ip and sp - ip , respectively . for",
    "a comparison , in the published sample of 420 pulsars found recently in the parkes multibeam pulsar survey @xcite one can identify clearly 4 cases of dp - ip and 1 case of sp - ip , and a few low intensity candidates .",
    "this gives lower limits of about 1% and 0.24% , respectively .",
    "it is difficult to estimate the actual rates of ip occurrences until the sensitive search for interpulses in the newly discovered pulsars is made .",
    "we assume that the plausible distributions of periods @xmath46 and inclination angles @xmath10 in the parent pulsar population should be able to explain about 2% of dp - ip and slightly above 0.5% of sp - ip in the normal pulsar population ( excluding millisecond and other recycled pulsars ) .",
    "we performed the monte carlo simulations of the pulse widths @xmath2 , pulsar periods @xmath46 and inclination angles @xmath10 , in an attempt to reproduce the observed distributions of these quantities .",
    "we have used the random number generator given in @xcite .",
    "our simulation procedure can be described as a number of subsequent steps :    \\(1 ) generate the inclination angle @xmath10 as a random deviate with the parent probability density function @xmath52 corresponding to equations ( [ f2 ] ) , ( [ fsin ] ) , ( [ fcos ] ) and ( [ fab ] ) , respectively .",

    "\\(7 ) judge the statistical significance using the k - s tests for the simulated and observed distributions of pulse width @xmath2 , period @xmath46 and inclination angle @xmath10 .      to make sure that our simulation software works properly , we begun with a reproduction of results given in the previous statistical works of gh96 and zjm03 .",
    "as expected , we managed to reproduce the k - s statistics for @xmath2 , beaming fraction @xmath62 and the rates of observed interpulses given in table  2 of gh96 ( to save space we do not reproduce this table here ) .",
    "however , the k - s test for pulsar periods ( not included in gh96 ) resulted in very low probabilities ( below @xmath63 ) , confirming the suggestion of tm98 that the distribution of periods in the parent pulsar population is significantly different from that of the observed distribution .",
    "as we argue later on in this paper , the plausible parent distribution of periods can be expressed in the form of a gamma function ( eq .  [",
    "[ fp ] ] ) with @xmath64 and @xmath65 , in contrast to @xmath27 and @xmath28 obtained for the observed sample of 516 pulsar periods by gh96 , or @xmath49 and @xmath50 obtained for 1165 periods used in this paper ( see also zjm03 ) .",
    "twelve entries in table  1 correspond to cases a1-a4 , b1-b4 and c1-c4 from table  1 in zjm03 ( we excluded cases d1-d4 since for @xmath66 they are equivalent to cases a1-a4 ) .",
    "as one can see , we reproduced quite well the results of k - s tests for @xmath46 , @xmath2 and @xmath10 , as well as the values of beaming fraction @xmath62 ( our period sample has few more pulsars below 0.05  s and above 4.2  s as compared to the one used by zjm03 ) .",
    "we added the rates of the interpulse occurrence and concluded that the pure @xmath67 distribution of the parent inclination angles ( a1 , b1 and c1 ) generates much too few dp - ip ( about 0.3% as compared with about 2% observed ) .",
    "thus , although the pure @xmath67 distribution gives very good results of k - s tests ( consistent with the results of tm98 and zjm03 ) , it should be rejected on the grounds of unacceptable interpulse statistics .",
    "we found out that the modified cosine distribution of zjm03 ( see eq .  [ 9 ] ) not only gives the plausible results of k - s test , but also reproduces the rate of occurrence of both dp - ip @xmath68 and sp - ip @xmath69 .",
    "we have examined 19200 combinations of distribution functions of pulsar periods ( eqs .",
    "[ [ fp ] ] , [ [ fpl ] ] and [ [ fp1 ] ] with 200 combinations of parameters in each case ) , opening angles ( eqs .  [ [ ro10 ] ] , [ [ ro10bis ] ] , [ 4a ] and [ 4b ] ) , inclination angles ( eqs .  [ [ f2 ] ] , [ [ fsin ] ] , [ [ fcos ] ] and [ [ fab ] ] ) as well as two options of the beam shape : circular ( eqs .",
    "[ [ ropi]]-[[ro3 ] ] ) and elliptical ( eqs .  [",
    "[ r]]-[[r ] ] ) .",
    "we recorded only those cases in which the following conditions were simultaneously satisfied : the probabilities @xmath43 that the observed and simulated distributions of @xmath45 and @xmath10 exceeded 0.1% , as well as the rates of occurrence of dp - ip and sp - ip exceeded 2% and 0.5% , respectively . with the adopted step of 0.02 in the parameters of gamma , lorentzian and gaussian functions ( eq .  [ [ fp]]-[[fp1 ] ] ) , this resulted in 15 records .",
    "table  2 presents 5 representative cases with the highest rates of sp - ip occurrence .",
    "we believe that case ( 1 ) is the most plausible one and figs .  1 - 3 present a visual comparison of the observed and simulated distribution corresponding to this case .",
    "below we discuss some aspects of our analysis , which are not reflected in table  2 .    both gamma ( eq .  [",
    "[ fp ] ] ) and lorentzian ( eq .  [ [ fpl ] ] )",
    "functions with parameter values @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath70 , @xmath71 respectively , are plausible parent density distribution functions .",
    "however , the gamma function seems much better suited to reflect the skew character of the pulsar period distribution .",
    "the gaussian function ( eq .  [ [ fp1 ] ] ) is rather unlikely . in the best case corresponding to @xmath72 and @xmath73 ,",
    "the significance @xmath43 is only about 0.03%    zjm03 argued , ignoring the issue of the interpulse emission , that the parent distribution of the magnetic inclination angles can be expressed by the cosine function or modified cosine function represented by equation  ( [ fab ] ) in this paper . including the analysis of interpulse statistics we confirm the latter , but we refute the cosine function , since it generates less than 0.3% of dp - ip ( as compared with about 2% observed ) .",
    "this is a strong conclusion since better statistics of interpulse occurrences can not change it in the future . as for other trial distribution functions , the sine - like function ( eq .  [ [ fsin ] ] ) generates too many dp - ip @xmath74 and far too few sp - ip @xmath75 , while the interpulse rates generated by the flat distribution function ( eq .  [ [ f2 ] ] )",
    "are roughly comparable with observations , especially when associated with the meridionally compressed beam ( eq .  [ [ r ] ] ) , but the results of k - s test for the magnetic inclination angles are not promising @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , the modified cosine function ( eq .  [ [ fab ] ] ) is the only plausible density distribution function that satisfies all constraints .",
    "we have checked whether one can improve the statistical results by changing values of parameters @xmath77 and @xmath78 in equation  ( [ fab ] ) .",
    "it appeared that without violating the basic condition that @xmath79 for all considered quantities ( @xmath45 and @xmath10 ) , one can only increase the interpulse rates by a small fraction ( e.g. from 0.74% to 0.77% for sp - ip ) and thus indeed @xmath80 and @xmath81 as suggested by zjm03 .",
    "for the 15 cases satisfying all constraints adopted in our analysis , the beaming fraction @xmath62 defined as the number of detected pulsars divided by 50000 detection attempts is @xmath82 .",
    "this is consistent with the probabilities of observing a normal radio pulsar obtained by both tm98 and zjm03 .",
    "in this paper we performed statistical studies using the monte carlo simulations of the possible parent distributions of pulsar periods @xmath46 and magnetic inclinations angles @xmath10 .",
    "we generated synthetic distributions of the pulse - widths @xmath2 , as well as the interpulse occurrences , and confronted them with the observational data by means of the kolmogorov - smirnov significance tests .",
    "we found out that the observed distributions of pulsar periods , pulse widths and inclination angles are relatively easy to reproduce with a variety of trial density distribution functions .",
    "however , when we use the criterion that the k - s significance probabilities @xmath43 for @xmath45 and @xmath10 are higher than 0.1% and that the generated interpulse rates agree with the observed rates , then we were left with just a few possibilities presented in table  2 .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows :    \\(1 ) the distribution of the magnetic inclination angles in the parent pulsar population is a complicated function represented by equation  ( [ fab ] ) , which has a local maximum around @xmath0 and another weaker one around @xmath1 .",
    "this function reproduces the observed distribution of the observed inclination angles ( fig .",
    "3 ) , as well as generates the rates of occurrence of interpulses at the observed levels .",
    "\\(2 ) the parent distribution of periods in the normal pulsar population ( excluding millisecond and other recycled pulsars ) can be described by the gamma function ( eq .  [",
    "[ fp ] ] ) with parameters @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the actual values of these parameters differ slightly depending on the @xmath39-p relation .",
    "\\(3 ) there is no evidence that the shape of the pulsar beam deviates significantly from a circular crossection .",
    "it is likely that the internal structure of a typical pulsar beam consist of two co - axial cones ( eq .  [ [ ro10bisbis ] ] )      in general , our results are consistent with those of zjm03 .",
    "however , we added the constrains related to the interpulse analysis and found out that this aspect of our analysis is the most restrictive one .",
    "we were able to reject the pure cosine distribution of the inclination angles , but we confirmed their modified cosine function which has a local maximum around @xmath0 and another weaker one near @xmath1 .",
    "this means that the evolution of the magnetic inclination angles in pulsars can not be described by any simple law ( alignment , counteralignment , etc ) .",
    "although we improved the analysis of zjm03 by adding the interpulse statistics , we are still missing an analysis of a possible effect of the intrinsic luminosity of radio pulsars on our results .",
    "this problem is , however , very difficult and complicated and we will postpone a full treatment to the subsequent paper . the proper approach would be to compare the synthetic radio luminosity with the minimum detectable flux achieved in a given pulsar survey , and thus it can be applied only to a uniform data sets of pulsars detected in single survey .",
    "our data do not have such a degree of uniformity . however , most surveys were less sensitive to long - period pulsars , as it follows from the nature of applied fourier - transform method .",
    "since the interpulse emission ( which appears to be the most restrictive constraint in our analysis ) occur mainly at shorter periods , then a possible underrepresentation of pulsars with longer periods should not affect significantly our general results .",
