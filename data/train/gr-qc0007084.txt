    "numerical studies of perturbations of black holes have revealed the presence of certain characteristic modes that govern the time evolution of the initial perturbation . these modes seem to depend only on the black hole parameters and not on the nature of the perturbation .",
    "this was first recognised by vishveshvara @xcite while studying perturbations of schwarzschild black holes . since then",
    ", perturbations of asymptotically flat black holes have been analysed and these characteristic modes(called quasi - normal modes ) have been found for some black holes ( a detailed account can be found in @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , there has been an interest in quasi - normal modes of @xmath0 black holes in light of the @xmath1 correspondence @xcite .",
    "there is some evidence to suggest that an off - equilibrium configuration in the bulk @xmath0 space is related to an off equilirium state in the boundary theory . in @xcite ,",
    "black hole formation by collapse of a thin shell in @xmath0 space is investigated .",
    "the shell is related by @xmath1 duality to an off - equilibrium state in the boundary theory which evolves towards equilibrium when the shell collapses to form a black hole .",
    "a quasi - normal mode governs the decay in time of a perturbation of the black hole configuration in the bulk .",
    "it should therefore be related by @xmath1 duality to the return of the boundary yang - mills theory to thermal equilibrium .",
    "the role of ingoing modes in determining the thermalization time scale of the boundary yang - mills theory was pointed out in @xcite . a numerical computation of quasi - normal mode frequencies for @xmath0",
    "black holes in various dimensions has been done in @xcite .    in this paper , we compute the quasi - normal modes for the @xmath0-schwarzschild black hole in five dimensions using a superpotential approach .",
    "this is done for the perturbation of a black hole by a minimally coupled scalar field .",
    "time - independent normal modes of a scalar field in the background of this black hole have already been analysed @xcite .",
    "we notice , that for the @xmath2 btz black hole , exact quasi - normal mode solutions can be obtained from the klein - gordon equation as the black hole potential belongs to a class of exactly solvable potentials , derived from a superpotential .",
    "we propose , based on analogy with the results for the @xmath2 btz black hole , and on numerical evidence in five dimensions , that the black hole potential can be described by a potential series derived from a superpotential .",
    "the problem is then exactly solvable and the form of the quasi - normal mode wave function is thus known .",
    "this is used as an ansatz to obtain the quasi - normal modes of the @xmath3 black hole . however , the numerical values of the mode frequencies do not agree with the earlier calculation in @xcite .",
    "we comment on this discrepancy .",
    "the organisation of this paper is as follows : the next section is a brief review of quasi - normal modes and their properties , and a short summary of some numerical approaches to computing these modes .    the actual computation of quasi - normal(qn ) modes for the @xmath3-schwarzschild black hole",
    "is described in section 3 .",
    "first , the qn modes for the @xmath2 btz black hole are evaluated .",
    "motivated by this , a superpotential approach to finding the qn modes for the five - dimensional black hole is presented and the mode frequencies obtained .    in section 4",
    ", we discuss our results .",
    "we show that the behaviour of the modes computed numerically by us for small black holes is consistent with that expected from the differential equation obeyed by the mode solutions .",
    "we mention salient points of two earlier papers @xcite and @xcite on the subject and comment on the discrepancy between the numerical values obtained by us and those in @xcite .",
    "we also state work in progress on qn modes for the rn @xmath3 black hole , and black holes in other dimensions .",
    "quasi - normal modes of a black hole are characteristic modes associated with the decay of any perturbation outside a black hole . in general , these modes do not form a complete set , in the sense that the time decay of a perturbation can not be described _ completely _ in terms of them . however",
    ", they dominate the decay at certain intermediate or late times . to compute these modes , one studies the decay of an initial perturbation by imposing ingoing boundary conditions at the horizon and ( for asymptotically flat black holes ) outgoing boundary conditions at infinity .",
    "this ensures that no gravitational wave from the horizon or infinity disturbs the initial perturbation . due to these boundary conditions , the quasi - normal modes are complex .",
    "the mode wave functions are non - normalisable in space but exponentially decay in time .",
    "since the exact mode wave functions are not known even for the schwarzschild black hole , there exist only numerical computations of quasi - normal modes .",
    "these are also very difficult to do as it is not easy to isolate the purely ingoing wave near the horizon that is also outgoing at infinity .",
    "such a wave function blows up at these points and could be contaminated by a small outgoing part at the horizon or a small ingoing part at infinity where these parts go exponentially to zero . a unique boundary condition to isolate quasi - normal modes",
    "has been given by nollert @xcite .",
    "the qn modes are poles of the green s function corresponding to the wave equation obeyed by the perturbing field . using this ,",
    "the qn modes for the schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrom black holes were evaluated numerically @xcite , @xcite .",
    "wkb methods have also been used to calculate these modes @xcite ( see also @xcite for more references ) .",
    "the method of continued fractions @xcite gives very accurate results for the modes .",
    "here , after removing the singular parts at the horizon and infinity , the qn mode wave function is expanded as a series .",
    "the coefficients in the series obey a three - term recurrence relation and depend on the quasi - normal mode frequency .",
    "the frequencies then have to satisfy a continued fraction relation .",
    "an interesting analytic approach to computing the qn modes is by approximating the black hole potential by an exactly solvable potential ( the poschl teller or eckart potential ) @xcite , @xcite .",
    "ferrari and mashhoon @xcite have mapped the problem of qnms of the poschl - teller potential to the bound states of the inverse potential and computed the modes .",
    "these approximate the fundamental qn modes of the schwarzschild black hole well .",
    "for the case of asymptotically anti - desitter black holes , the black hole potential diverges at infinity . therefore , as pointed out in @xcite , the quasi - normal modes are defined to be those that are ingoing at the horizon , but fall off to zero at infinity .",
    "it can be shown that this also agrees with the unique boundary condition of nollert @xcite for obtaining quasi - normal modes .",
    "however , due to the divergence of the @xmath0 black hole potential at infinity , most of the methods described above to compute the qn modes of asymptotically flat black holes can not be used directly .",
    "it is seen that a combination of two methods , inspired by the case of the @xmath4 black hole , yields good results .",
    "we first consider the case of the qn modes of the non - rotating @xmath4 btz black hole @xcite .",
    "the non - rotating btz black hole metric for a spacetime with negative cosmological constant @xmath5 is given by @xmath6    with @xmath7 the horizon radius @xmath8 .",
    "we consider a massless scalar field in the black hole background .",
    "the klein - gordon equation for the scalar field is written using an ansatz ( independent of the angular variable ) for the field @xmath9 and by going to the tortoise coordinate @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",
    "the klein- gordon equation is @xmath12 where @xmath13 since @xmath14 where @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 is the surface gravity of the black hole and is equal to @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the hawking temperature .      as discussed in @xcite , the lowest energy state for the potential @xmath23",
    "has energy zero , so the lowest energy for the potential @xmath24 is @xmath25 .",
    "the wave function corresponding to this state is      for any of the two values of @xmath27 and @xmath28 in ( [ abdef ] ) , the wave function ( [ wf3 ] ) is not normalisable .",
    "it blows up either at the horizon or at @xmath29 ( i.e @xmath30 ) .",
    "we are interested in the quasi - normal mode solution that blows up at the horizon and falls off to zero at infinity .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath31 .",
    "also , @xmath32 .",
    "the lowest energy ( formally , since the wave function corresponding to this is non - normalisable ) is then @xmath33 and the lowest quasi - normal mode @xmath34 .",
    "therefore ,            with @xmath39 where the black hole mass @xmath40 is @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the area of a unit 3-sphere . the klein - gordon equation for the scalar field in the background of this black hole can be written , as before , as a potential problem . using the ansatz for the field @xmath43 and by changing to the tortoise",
    "coordinate given by @xmath44 , the klein gordon equation is          if the potential could be written as an exactly solvable potential in the @xmath10 coordinate , then the quasi - normal modes could be obtained easily from the ` lowest ' energy , as in the btz case . as mentioned in the previous section , the fundamental qn modes of the schwarzschild black hole were closely approximated by the qn modes of the poschl - teller potential .",
    "this is also an exactly solvable potential derivable from a superpotential @xcite .",
    "we propose that the potential can be written as a series , derived from a superpotential of the form @xmath47 where as in ( [ sgrav ] ) , @xmath17 is the black hole surface gravity , @xmath48 as before , @xmath49 , where @xmath19 is the hawking temperature .",
    "it has lowest energy @xmath51 the form of the potential is such that it goes exponentially to zero in @xmath10 as @xmath52 and blows up as @xmath53 as @xmath54 ( or @xmath55 ) .",
    "this reproduces the behaviour of the black hole potential .",
    "we propose that this potential series is exactly equal to the black hole potential ( [ pot5 ] ) .",
    "terminating this potential series at finite order would then mean an approximation to the black hole potential in the spirit of the poschl - teller method for asymptotically flat black holes .",
    "the wave function corresponding to the lowest energy state is @xmath56 it is non - normalisable , as in the @xmath4 case . in order to calculate the quasi - normal modes for the @xmath0-schwarzschild black hole , we use ( [ wf5 ] ) as an ansatz in the equation ( [ eqn5 ] ) .",
    "however , we truncate the product in the ansatz upto some finite order .",
    "this is equivalent to truncating the potential series .",
    "we first write @xmath57 this isolates the non - normalisable part of the wave function",
    ". we can rewrite ( [ eqn5 ] ) as an equation for @xmath58 as @xmath59 here , @xmath24 is the black hole potential ( [ pot5 ] ) .",
    "we now try to solve for @xmath60 by taking the ansatz        the ansatz for @xmath58 is substituted into ( [ eq5 ] ) and the l.h.s of ( [ eq5 ] ) is expanded as a series in @xmath65 where @xmath66 from ( [ eq5 ] ) , each term of the series is to be equated to zero .",
    "we first divide ( [ eq5 ] ) by @xmath58 .",
    "then , we have @xmath67            the @xmath74 coefficients are functions of @xmath60 and of the black hole parameters . the recursion relation for the @xmath74",
    "is complicated , unlike the case of the method of partial fractions @xcite applied to asymptotically flat black holes . there , an ansatz was taken for the wave function ( removing its singular part ) and it was expanded as a series whose coefficients obeyed a simple three - term recursion relation . from ( [ eq5 ] ) , as @xmath54 ( i.e as @xmath55 ) , the two kinds of solutions are @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the first solution is not normalisable .",
    "we want the quasi - normal mode solution to vanish as @xmath54 .",
    "so we choose the second solution .",
    "but from our ansatz ( [ psi5 ] ) for the solution , this implies a relation between the coefficients @xmath74 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath77    since the @xmath74 coefficients are functions of @xmath60 , this relation gives the value of the lowest quasi - normal mode as a function of the black hole parameters .",
    "this would then be an approximation to the actual qn mode of the black hole at order @xmath63 .",
    "thus , the asymptotic behaviour of the actual solution is _ explicitly _ demanded of the ansatz .",
    "this is _ used _ to obtain the mode frequencies from the relation ( [ asy5 ] ) .",
    "we have used this method to calculate the qn modes at various orders @xmath63 .",
    "we find that as we increase @xmath63 , there is a convergence in the mode frequency .",
    "the mode frequencies are given in table 1 .",
    "they have been calculated at order @xmath78 . beyond this order , as ( [ asy5 ] )",
    "is complicated , it becomes computationally time - consuming to find its roots .",
    "however , as there is a clear convergence in the mode frequency as one increases the order from @xmath79 and as the percentage difference between the real and imaginary parts of the mode frequency at order @xmath78 and @xmath80 is about 1% ( for @xmath81 , it is 1.26% , and for @xmath82 , it is 1.09% ) , these numbers should be a good approximation to the qn modes of the black hole ( more discussion on results is given in the next section ) .",
    "the numerical results obtained in @xcite for the five dimensional black hole do not agree with our values for the qn modes .",
    "there , the solution to ( [ eq5 ] ) is expanded as a series around the horizon in the inverse radial coordinate @xmath83 . using this ,",
    "the l.h.s of ( [ eq5 ] ) is expanded as a series around the horizon , and a recursion relation is obtained for the coefficients in the expansion of the solution .",
    "the coefficients @xmath84 are functions of the black hole parameters and the mode frequency @xmath60 . therefore , @xmath85 the mode frequencies are then the roots of the equation obtained by setting the series to zero at @xmath86 . in actual computation , the series is truncated , and the roots obtained . however , the mode frequencies seem to go to zero as @xmath87 , which is not the behaviour expected from the differential equation .",
    "a numerical computation of qn modes is tricky because of the nature of the boundary conditions on the mode solution at both the horizon and at infinity .",
    "the mode , which is ingoing ( and not normalisable ) at the horizon , could be contaminated by an outgoing component which goes to zero there . at the other boundary",
    ", the solution is required to go to zero . in a numerical truncation , it could also be contaminated as @xmath88 ( i.e as @xmath55 ) by the solution that blows up at this end . therefore , in a numerical computation , it is essential to ensure the correct ingoing behaviour near the horizon and the correct _ asymptotic _ behaviour of the solution that goes to zero as @xmath55 . in our method ,",
    "similar to the continued fraction method for asymptotically flat black holes , we have a _ specific _ ansatz for the wave function where the behaviour at _ both _ boundaries is explicitly present in the form of the ansatz .",
    "the form of our ansatz ensures that there is no contamination from the outgoing part at the horizon . at the other end as @xmath88 ( i.e as @xmath55 ) , we _ demand _",
    "that the solution must fall off as @xmath89 at every order .",
    "this _ ensures _ that there is no contamination from the solution that blows up at this end .",
    "we have presented a new approach to computing the quasi - normal modes of @xmath0 black holes .",
    "the novel feature of this method was an ansatz for the qn mode wave function which was derived from a superpotential .",
    "this was made in analogy with the case of the three dimensional btz black hole where the modes can be obtained exactly and the wave function is derived from a superpotential .",
    "the btz qn modes were proportional to the surface gravity .",
    "the modes obtained by us numerically for the five dimensional black hole are also approximately proportional to the surface gravity .",
    "more importantly , the modes obtained by us numerically are proportional to the inverse of the horizon radius for small black holes , reflecting the well - known fact that these black holes are unstable .",
    "we have also shown , from some scaling properties of the differential equation obeyed by the mode solutions , that this is indeed to be expected for small black holes .",
    "work is in progress to compute the qn modes for ads black holes in four and seven dimensions , and also the corresponding reissner - nordstrom black holes using this approach . some preliminary work on the five dimensional rn @xmath0 black hole seems to suggest that the qn mode increases with the charge of the black hole .",
