    "the two - gluon exchange model @xcite has for a long time offered a semi - quantitative understanding of the pomeron in qcd .",
    "the model originated as a view of elastic scattering .",
    "it has been applied extensively to vector meson photoproduction , and has recently been used to predict jet production in double pomeron interactions @xcite . in this paper , we use the model to calculate exclusive @xmath1 photoproduction at low @xmath2 .",
    "the diagrams for @xmath0 are shown in figure  1 .",
    "the upper half of each diagram can be calculated in a straight - forward manner , since only known electroweak and gluonic couplings appear .",
    "the lower half of each diagram involves the non - perturbative color structure of the proton , but the required discontinuity can be obtained by parametrizing it and constraining the parameters to fit @xmath3 elastic scattering .",
    "the calculation of @xmath1 photoproduction thus introduces no new parameters .",
    "a similar calculation can be done for @xmath4 , where @xmath5 provides a large momentum scale ; but that calculation is not as clean because it brings in the @xmath6 hadronic wave function .",
    "reggeization of the gluons and interactions between them ( e.g. , as given by ladder diagrams ) must be responsible for the gradual energy dependence of pomeron exchange @xcite .",
    "we will ignore these effects here . from a practical standpoint , the energy dependence of @xmath0",
    "will be dominated by the minimum longitudinal momentum transfer that is kinematically required when the energy is not far above threshold .",
    "the predicted cross section is necessarily small , because the large mass @xmath7 sets a short distance scale @xmath8 for the typical transverse separation between the @xmath9 pair that form the @xmath1 .",
    "this leads to a factor @xmath10 in the final amplitude , which is proportional to the color dipole moment of the pair .",
    "a couple of enhancement factors @xmath11 arise in the calculation , as explained below ; but the final predicted cross section turns out to be too small to observe at the hera @xmath12 collider in its present form .",
