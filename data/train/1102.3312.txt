    "as in the cuprates , superconductivity sets in upon doping an antiferromagnetic parent compound.@xcite nevertheless , there are some important differences : the fe - based superconductors emerge by doping a metallic parent compound , the anisotropy is in general lower when compared to that of the cuprates , and the symmetry of the order parameter is claimed to be @xmath15-wave with fermi - surface nesting playing a major role .",
    "@xcite therefore , the fundamental question arises whether the mechanisms leading to superconductivity in both families of high temperature superconductors share a common origin .",
    "neutron scattering experiments revealed that in the undoped compounds the magnetic moments of the fe ions display a collinear antiferromagnetic order , which is claimed to be itinerant in character.@xcite it was suggested that the antiferromagnetism in undoped compounds is driven by a nesting instability,@xcite connecting cylindrical fermi surfaces of hole and electron character through the antiferromagnetic modulation vector @xmath16 ( in the original and undistorted tetragonal brillouin zone),@xcite hence forming a spin - density wave .",

    "<S> the low - temperature antiferromagnetic state of the sm - ions in both nonsuperconducting smfeaso and superconducting smfeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 single crystals was studied by magnetic torque , magnetization , and magnetoresistance measurements in magnetic fields up to 60  t and temperatures down to 0.6  k. we uncover in both compounds a distinct rearrangement of the antiferromagnetically ordered sm - moments near @xmath2  t. this is seen in both , static and pulsed magnetic fields , as a sharp change in the sign of the magnetic torque , which is sensitive to the magnetic anisotropy and hence to the magnetic moment in the @xmath3-plane , ( _ i.e. _ the feas - layers ) , and as a jump in the magnetization for magnetic fields perpendicular to the conducting planes . </S>",
    "<S> this rearrangement of magnetic ordering in @xmath2  t is essentially temperature independent and points towards a canted or a partially polarized magnetic state in high magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> however , the observed value for the saturation moment above this rearrangement , suggests that the complete suppression of the antiferromagnetism related to the sm - moments would require fields in excess of 60  t. such a large field value is particularly remarkable when compared to the relatively small nel temperature @xmath4  k , suggesting very anisotropic magnetic exchange couplings . at the transition , </S>",
    "<S> magnetoresistivity measurements show a crossover from positive to negative field - dependence , indicating that the charge carriers in the feas planes are sensitive to the magnetic configuration of the rare - earth elements . </S>",
    "<S> this is indicates a finite magnetic / electronic coupling between the smo and the feas layers which are likely to mediate the exchange interactions leading to the long range antiferromagnetic order of the sm ions . </S>"
