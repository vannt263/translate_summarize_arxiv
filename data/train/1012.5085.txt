    "this connection between central black hole growth and star formation rate is often considered in the context of ` feedback ' process(es ) , as the former is postulated to regulate the latter .",

    "there is some observational evidence of _ positive _ feedback , whereby star formation is triggered by an agn jet , e.g. in minkowski s object by a jet from ngc 541 @xcite , as well as theoretical models which suggest that the shocks generated by jet propagation can trigger collapse of over - dense clouds and lead to star formation @xcite .",
    "_ negative _ feedback by agn jets would likely require the removal of fuel for star formation , evidence for which are the powerful agn - induced outflows which have been seen in high redshift radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "such a scenario has also been proposed to regulate the growth of massive galaxies in semi - empirical models @xcite , but this process is only important globally at late times , @xmath27 . at earlier times it would be most important in halting the growth of the most massive galaxies .",
    "star formation in powerful agn has been difficult to trace so far .",
    "this difficulty is due to heavy contamination in traditional diagnostics by emission from the agn ( e.g. uv luminosity or optical emission line strengths ) as well as obscuration by gas and dust .",

    "we use this definition of ` radio - loud ' agn , based on radio luminosity density @xcite , in order to avoid making any distinction between type 1 and type 2 agn , i.e. agn classification based upon optical spectroscopy , where different amounts of agn obscuration may affect the relative amount of optical emission .",

    "we convert the @xmath65 luminosities to total ir luminosities using the relation of @xcite and then to sfrs using the kennicutt ( 1998 ) relation as before . due to the size of the sample and the influence of one very luminous source we use the median inferred sfr and find that the range of typical sfrs for the local 3crr sample is @xmath68yr@xmath20 from these two assumptions",

    "the moderate redshift sample is complete within the uncertainties of the s - cubed simulation ( we find 15/16 predicted sources in this redshift / luminosity density paramter space ) .",
    "hence , we can directly calculate the mean sfr of the low redshift sample by summing the observed sfrs and dividing by the number sources .",
    "the uncertainties are simply those of the measured sfrs , which directly come from the uncertainties in the ir luminosities , combined with the @xmath75per cent uncertainty in the s - cubed model . as the latter are so much greater than the former our uncertainties are dominated by the conservative uncertainties we used in s - cubed .",

    "we can not estimate the properties of sources not included in our high redsift sample due to lack of redshift information .",

    "we find the increase in mean sfr of radio - loud agn hosts ( parameterised as @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) to be greater than that of the ir luminosity function which traces the evolution of the general star forming population .",
    "this greater rate of increase with redshift , compared to the regular star forming population , suggests that some of the star formation may be directly associated with the radio - loud agn activity .",
    "the increase of mean sfr with redshift of agn is also seen in x - ray selected agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in a heterogenous sample of agn @xcite",
    ". alternatively , our results could reflect an increase in the stellar mass of the host galaxy , since high stellar mass galaxies have sfrs which increase with redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this interpretation would fit in with the recent @xcite result who find that at low redshifts , @xmath98 , not all ulirgs are massive enough to host radio - loud agn . if the stellar masses of ulirgs increase with redshift then ulirgs would be more likely to host radio - loud agn at higher redshifts .",
    "while it is likely that the redshift information for the high redshift sample is biased toward sources that have bright @xmath54 flux densities ( see   [ sec : radio ] ) , our approach of determining a range of mean sfrs given two extreme assumptions alleviates much of the concern about selection bias .",
    "the remaining principle source of uncertainty is the s - cubed model , used to quantify how complete our sub - samples were . as discussed earlier ,",
    "our uncertainties in s - cubed are very conservative .",
    "s - cubed treats the agn and sfgs as separate populations , i.e. it does not include hybrid radio sources exhibiting both processes simultaneously .",
    "we can thereby compare the expected number of radio - loud agn regardless of whether there is ongoing star formation in their hosts or not .",
    "the contribution to the sfr density of the host galaxies of radio - loud agn in the high redshift bin is interesting as the sfr density at this epoch is dominated by lirgs and ulirgs @xcite .",
    "as @xmath99per cent of the sfr density consists of lirgs and ulirgs which host the radio - loud agn , we can infer a duty cycle of @xmath100 for radio - loud agn activity in such sources , assuming that each lirg and ulirg goes through at least one radio - loud phase .",
    "the typical time - scale of a radio - loud phase of an agn is around @xmath101myr for extended radio sources @xcite and likely shorter for the less luminous sources with smaller radio lobes considered here . given this lifetime and the estimated duty cycle of @xmath100 we can estimate that lirgs and ulirgs undergo a radio - loud agn phase every @xmath102gyr . hence , during the @xmath103gyr time span covered by the high redshift sub - sample we could expect perhaps one major phase of radio - loud agn activity at a rate similar to that expected from major mergers @xcite .    the feedback models which quench star formation by evoking a radio - loud phase ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are most important at late times , i.e. below @xmath27 , but they must occur at higher redshifts in order to prevent the most massive galaxies , formed at early times , from growing significantly more .",
    "however , in this work we observe many agn in our high redshift sub - sample which are in a state equivalent to the ` radio - mode ' feedback of @xcite and simultaneously have very high sfrs while feedback processes are predicted to be occuring .",
    "we have examined the incidence of far - ir emission and inferred sfr of luminous radio - loud agn in a moderate redshift , @xmath80 , and a high redshift sub - sample , @xmath104 , as well as a local , @xmath58 , comparison sample .",
    "we have :    * constrained the mean sfr of radio - loud agn to be @xmath13@xmath14@xmath15 , @xmath16@xmath14@xmath17 and @xmath18@xmath14@xmath19yr@xmath20 for the local , moderate and high redshift samples respectively , hence , we measure the evolution of the mean sfr to be @xmath105 , * observed no strong trends of sfr with radio luminosity in any redshift bin , * estimated that the host galaxies of radio - loud agn in the high redshift sub - sample contribute @xmath99per cent to the total sfr density at that epoch and if all lirgs and ulirgs have a radio - loud phase we infer a duty cycle of @xmath100 in such sources .",
    "these results demonstrate that in the distant universe a considerable amount of star formation is occuring in galaxies hosting a radio - loud agn , consistent with the frequent evidence for high sfrs in classic high redshift radio galaxies . the mean sfr evolves more quickly than the ir luminosity function implying that some of the star formation is directly related to the radio - loud agn activity .",
    "both starburst and active nuclear processes have relatively short time - scales so their co - existence in many objects suggests that bursts of star formation and jet activity either are quite common or connected via ` feedback ' . but is the jet initiating or quenching star formation , or are the processes independent ?",
    "we can not answer such questions here , but we shall be able to do so with follow - up of individual sources ( to search for outflows of jet - triggered star formation or for mergers triggering both ) and with the huge sample that will be provided by the full hermes data set combined with improved redshift information .",
