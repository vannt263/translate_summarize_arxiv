    "we explain the low formation energy of a @xmath4 in position 5 in terms of electronic states associated with the o atoms prior to the @xmath4 formation . in fig .",
    "[ fig : vac]c the projected density of states of the 2_p _ orbitals of the o atoms of interest are shown . it is striking that the two o atoms that are easy to remove are the ones that contribute to the top of the valence band with a well defined state of 2_p _ character , fig .",

    "based on these results , we conclude that a reduced tio@xmath1(110 ) sample that shows even a low concentration of bridging @xmath4 at the terraces , must accommodate a high number of @xmath4 along @xmath22  step edges .      given the structures for reduced steps running along the @xmath17 $ ] direction we have tested the activity of such extended defects towards the adsorption of water and methanol and compared to the activity of the well known reduced and flat ( 110 ) terrace , fig .",
    "[ fig : water ] . both water and methanol molecules dissociate and bind strongly at bridging @xmath4 ( fig .",

    "the results for dissociation of water at step edges are in very good agreement with earlier water tpd experiments that show a recombinative desorption peak at temperatures lower than the one at vacancy sites @xcite",

    "@xcite where this intermediate peak is not discussed ) . in addition , hydroxyl groups at step edges resulted from water dissociation have been reported to be observed by suzuki _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "our results suggest a similar behavior of water and methanol .",
    "we predict methanol to dissociate at reduced @xmath22  steps .",
    "this result is compatible with methanol tpd experiments performed by henderson _",
    "the tpd spectra for methanol adsorbed on a tio@xmath1(110 ) surface shows three distinct states at 295 , 350 and 480  k. the low and the high temperature peaks are assigned to molecular methanol adsorbed along ti troughs ( e@xmath26=0.84  ev ) and to dissociative methanol adsorbed at bridging @xmath4 sites ( e@xmath26=1.51  ev , fig .",
    "[ fig : water ] ) , respectively .",
    "we propose the methanol dissociated at vacancy sites along step edges , the configuration shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : water ] , to be responsible of the third peak at 350  k ( e@xmath26=1.02  ev ) .",
    "this assignment is compatible with the appearance of this peak at low coverage and with the authors conclusion that methanol desorbing at this temperature is formed from recombination of dissociated methoxy species .",
    "in summary , we have provided a clear understanding of the local structure of step edges on rutile tio@xmath1(110 ) surface .",
    "an automated genetic algorithm was employed leading to the finding of a new structure for the @xmath3  step edge that differed from the bulk truncated one .",
    "knowing the correct structure of step edges is of fundamental importance and can have many consequences for several reasons . here",
    ", we have shown that oxygen vacancies can be extremely stable at step edges .",
    "a reduced rutile sample thus hosts not only point defects , like oxygen vacancies or ti interstitial , but also highly reduced step edges .",
    "this conclusion can easily be extended to other reducible metal oxide system and can strongly influence the activity of the near step region .",
    "for example , water and methanol molecules dissociate at reduced @xmath3  step edges as in bridging @xmath4 , but with lower binding energies .",
    "this implies that while point defects at terraces become polluted , point defects at step may engage in a catalytic cycle .",
    "the results for water are in good agreement with earlier experimental results where it has been speculated that step edges may play a role in the water dissociation @xcite . for methanol adsorption",
    "we reinterpret previous experimental results @xcite and propose a similar behavior for higher alcohols .",
    "our findings also suggest the possibility of tuning the activity of the rutile tio@xmath1(110 ) surface allowing to decrease the temperature needed for the desorption of strongly bounded species .",
    "for example , changing the experimental conditions or the surrounding environment can result in a different morphology of the surface @xcite and in particular in a different ratio between flat ( 110 ) terraces and step edges .",
    "moreover , vicinal surfaces that expose a high concentration of step edges oriented along specific directions can be employed @xcite .",
