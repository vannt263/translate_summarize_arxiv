    "the simplest way to find new examples with differential relations of higher order consists of the following construction , which naturally appears in thom s singularity theory @xcite as it is shown in the next subsection .    consider a proper submanifold @xmath101 or a proper stratified set with nice singularities ( for instance , with _",

    "<S> the first part of this article intends to present the role played by thom in diffusing smale s ideas about immersion theory , at a time ( 1957 ) where some famous mathematicians were doubtful about them : _ it is * clearly * impossible to turn the sphere inside out ! _ around a decade later , m. gromov transformed smale s idea into what is now known as the @xmath0-_principle_. here , the @xmath0 stands for _ homotopy_.    shortly after the astonishing discovery by smale , thom gave a conference in lille ( 1959 ) announcing a theorem which would deserve to be named _ a homological @xmath0-principle_. the aim of our second part is to comment about this theorem which was completely ignored by the topologists in paris , but not in leningrad . </S>",
