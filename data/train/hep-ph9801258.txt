    "the presence of three generations of quarks and leptons , apparently identical except for mass , strongly suggests that they are composed of still more fundamental fermions .",
    "it is clear that , if substructure exist , the associated strong interaction energy scale @xmath0 must be much greater than the quark and lepton masses .",
    "long ago ,  t  hooft figured out how interactions at high energy could produce essentially massless composite fermions : the answer lies in unbroken chiral symmetries of the underlying fermions and confinement of their new strong nonabelian gauge interactions@xcite .",
    "there followed a great deal of theoretical effort to construct a realistic model of composite quarks and leptons ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) which , while leading to valuable insights on chiral gauge theories , fell short of its main goal .",
    "it was pointed out that the existence of quark and lepton substructure will be signalled at energies well below @xmath1 by the appearance of four - fermion `` contact '' interactions which differ from those arising in the standard model@xcite .",
    "these interactions are induced by the exchange of bound states associated with the new gauge interactions .",
    "the main constraint on their form is that they must be @xmath2 invariant because they are generated by forces operating at or above the electroweak scale .",
    "these contact interactions are suppressed by @xmath3 , but the coupling parameter of the exchanges  analogous to the pion - nucleon and rho - pion couplings  is not small .",
    "compared to the standard model , contact interaction amplitudes are of relative order @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the center of mass energy of the process taking place and @xmath6 the coupling constant of the standard model interaction .",
    "the appearance of @xmath7 and the growth with @xmath8 make contact - interaction effects the lowest - energy signal of quark and lepton substructure .",
    "they are sought in jet production at hadron and lepton colliders , drell - yan production of high invariant mass lepton pairs , bhabha scattering , @xmath9 and @xmath10@xcite , atomic parity violation@xcite , and polarized mller scattering@xcite .",
    "hadron collider experiments can probe values of @xmath1 from the 25  tev range at the tevatron to the 1520  tev range at the lhc ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    here , we will study in some details one specific example for the first muon collider ( fmc ) : the constraint that can be imposed on the scale of muon compositeness by measuring bhabha scattering .",
    "the specific form for the muon contact interaction is presented in section ii .",
    "( all the results presented here are also applicable to electron compositeness at @xmath11 colliders with same energy and luminosity . )",
    "cello at petra with a center of mass energy , @xmath5 , of 35 gev and an integrated luminosity , @xmath12 , of @xmath13 was able to put a lower limit on the ( electron ) compositeness scale of the order of 2 - 4  tev , depending on the specific model for compositeness@xcite .",
    "this is about the same reach as the current tevatron reach .",
    "this clearly show the potential for lepton colliders to probe compositeness ; they have an enormous reach .    in section iii , we study the reach versus the energy of the fmc , with the corresponding luminosity chosen for this workshop .",
    "we also study the effect of the angular cut on the reach .",
    "it is important to study that effect because large amount of radiation close to the beam will limit the capability of the detectors outside the central region .",
    "we assume the muon has a substructure . for collider energy below the scale associated with this new structure",
    ", the effect can be parametrized by a four fermions interaction . here",
    ", we use the flavor - diagonal , helicity - conserving contact interaction proposed by e.  j.  eichten , k.  lane and m.  e.  peskin@xcite : @xmath14,\\ ] ] @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the left - handed and right - handed currents and @xmath1 the compositeness scale .",
    "the coupling constant , @xmath17 , is assumed to be strong and set to one . by convention ,",
    "the @xmath18 have magnitude one .",
    "the unpolarized cross section at lowest order , including the @xmath19 and @xmath20 exchange ( s and t channel ) and the contact interaction from eq .  [ eq : contact ] can be written in the following form , see ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath21\\ ] ] where @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 and @xmath26 @xmath6 is the usual fine structure constant , @xmath27 the scattering angle between the incoming and outgoing muon , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 the vector and axial vector coupling constant , @xmath31 and @xmath32 the mass and width of the z , and @xmath33 the fermi constant .",
    "we will consider four typical models : ll couplings ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) , rr couplings ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) , vv couplings ( @xmath38 ) , and aa couplings ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the positive and negative sign indicate the possible constructive or destructive interference between the electroweak ( ew ) and compositeness contributions .",
    ".energy of the collider , luminosity , cross section ( with @xmath40 ) , and the expected number of events . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we investigated the limits on the muon compositeness scale that could be obtained at the first muon collider using the bhabha scattering process .",
    "we considered four typical models for the four - fermion contact terms expected as a low - energy signal for compositeness : ll , rr , vv , and aa couplings .",
    "as expected , the reach increases rapidly with energy .",
    "we find that the reach at the 500 gev fmc is @xmath41  tev depending on the model . at a future @xmath42 muon collider the range extends to @xmath43  tev .",
    "the likelihood of limited angular coverage in detectors ( because of the unavoidable background of decaying muons ) does not appear to poise a severe problem for the study of muon compositeness .",
    "we found that an angular coverage corresponding to @xmath44 is adequate to obtain 90% of the full reach in the compositeness scale @xmath1 .",
    "a number of detailed studies remain to be done .",
    "for example , it is clear that the polarization will help to differentiate between the four models considered here .",
    "also we have only considered the statistical uncertainties , the systematic uncertainties in measurements of bhabha scattering could be significant and need to be included in future more realistic studies .",
