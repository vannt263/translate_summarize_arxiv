    "in this paper , we call the following operation on a link a _ _ banding _ _ on the link . for a given link @xmath0 in the 3-sphere @xmath1 and an embedding @xmath2 such that @xmath3 , where @xmath4 denotes a closed interval , we obtain a ( new ) link as @xmath5 .",
    "we call the link so obtained _ the link obtained from @xmath0 by a banding along the band @xmath6_.    this operation would be first studied in @xcite , and then , played very important roles in various scenes in knot theory , and also in much wider ranges , for example , relation to dna topology ( see @xcite for example )",
    ". also see @xcite for some of recent studies .    on performing a banding , it is often assumed the compatibility of orientations of the original link and the obtained link , but in this paper",
    ", we do not assume that . also note that this operation for a knot yielding a knot appears as the @xmath7 case of the @xmath8-move on a knot , which was introduced in @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for a study of @xmath9-move on knots for example .",
    "in general , for an operation on knots and links , a fundamental question must be when the operation preserves the type of a knot and link .",
    "for example , for the crossing change operation , this question is related to the famous nugatory crossing conjecture ( * ? ? ?",
    "* problem 1.58 ) .",
    "let us consider this question for a banding in this paper .",
    "precisely we say that a banding on a link @xmath0 in @xmath1 is _ cosmetic _ if the link @xmath10 obtained by a ( non - trivial ) banding on @xmath0 is equivalent to @xmath0 , in other words , there exists a self - homeomorphism of @xmath1 which takes @xmath0 to @xmath10 . if the self - homeomorphism is orientation - preserving ( resp .",
    "orientation - reversing ) , then we call the banding is a _ purely _ cosmetic ( resp",
    ". _ chirally _ cosmetic ) .",
    "there always exists a `` trivial '' banding on a link which is cosmetic , that is when the band is half - twisted and parallel to the link .",
    "however , also some other `` non - trivial '' examples are known . in this paper , we analyze and describe mechanisms of known examples , and present more examples of cosmetic bandings .",
    "detailed contents are as follows .    in section  [ sec : bandandsurgery ] , we give a brief review on a relationship between a banding and a dehn surgery .",
    "we also introduce some terminologies used in this paper .    in section  [ sec:4-move ] , we give examples of cosmetic bandings realized by a @xmath11-move operation . in particular , based on the examples given in @xcite , we present a family of infinitely many two - bridge links which admit cosmetic bandings .",
    "actually we see that the family coincides with the set of two - bridge links with unlinking number one .    in section  [ sec : torusknot ]",
    ", we analyze the example of a cosmetic banding given in @xcite , that is , a cosmetic banding on the torus knot of type @xmath12 .",
    "we will describe why such a cosmetic banding can occur , and point out the example is quite sporadic .    in section  [ sec:9_27 ]",
    ", we see that the knot @xmath13 in the knot table admits a cosmetic banding , and reveal its mechanism . as a matter of fact",
    ", the example comes from the famous example related to the cosmetic surgery conjecture given in @xcite . as a byproduct",
    ", we give a hyperbolic knot which admits exotic chirally cosmetic dehn surgeries yielding hyperbolic 3-manifolds .",
    "this gives a counterexample to a conjecture raised by bleiler , hodgson and weeks in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* conjecture 2 ) .",
    "the known examples and our examples are all chirally ones .",
    "therefore it remains open whether there exists a non - trivial purely cosmetic banding on a link .",
    "in this section , as a basic tool used throughout this paper , we describe a relationship between a banding on a link and a dehn surgery on a knot .",
    "let @xmath14 be a knot in a 3-manifold @xmath15 with the exterior @xmath16 ( i.e. , the complement of an open tubular neighborhood of @xmath14 ) .",
    "let @xmath17 be a slope ( i.e. , an isotopy class of non - trivial simple closed curves ) on the boundary torus @xmath18 . then , the _ dehn surgery on @xmath14 along @xmath17 _ is defined as the following operation . glue a solid torus @xmath19 to @xmath16 such that a simple closed curve representing @xmath17 bounds a meridian disk in @xmath19 .",
    "we denote the obtained manifold by @xmath20 .",
    "it is said that the dehn surgery along the meridional slope is the _ trivial _ dehn surgery .",
    "also it is said that a dehn surgery along a slope which is represented by a simple closed curve with single intersection point with the meridian is an _ integral _ dehn surgery .",
    "in the case where @xmath21 , we have the well - known bijective correspondence between @xmath22 and the slopes on @xmath18 , which is given by using the standard meridian - longitude system for @xmath14 .",
    "when the slope @xmath17 corresponds to @xmath23 , then the dehn surgery on @xmath14 along @xmath17 is said to be the _ @xmath24-dehn surgery _ on @xmath14 , or the _ @xmath24-surgery _ on @xmath14 for brevity .",
    "we also denote the obtained manifold by @xmath25 . in this case",
    ", we note that an integral dehn surgery corresponds to an @xmath26-dehn surgery with an integer @xmath26 .",
    "we here recall the montesinos trick originally introduced in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath27 be the double branched cover of @xmath1 branched along a link @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath14 be a knot in @xmath27 , which is _ strongly invertible _ with respect to the preimage @xmath29 of @xmath0 , that is , there is an orientation preserving involution of @xmath27 with the quotient @xmath15 and the fixed point set @xmath29 which induces an involution of @xmath14 with two fixed points .",
    "then the manifold @xmath20 obtained by an integral dehn surgery on @xmath14 is homeomorphic to the double branched cover along the link obtained from @xmath0 by a banding along the band appearing as the quotient of @xmath14 with the corresponding framing @xmath24 .",
    "see @xcite for example .      in view of the montesinos trick , studying cosmetic bandings on links",

    "* problem 1.81(a ) ) ) : two surgeries on inequivalent slopes are never purely cosmetic .    here",
    "two slopes are called _ equivalent _ if there exists a self - homeomorphism of the exterior of a knot @xmath14 taking one slope to the other , and two surgeries on @xmath14 along two slopes are called _ purely cosmetic _ ( resp .  _ _ chirally cosmetic _",

    "these terminologies were introduced in @xcite .",
    "the conjecture suggests that exotic purely cosmetic bandings on links might not exist , or are quite hard to find if exist . on the other hand",
    ", it is known that the cosmetic surgery conjecture for `` chirally cosmetic '' case is not true .",
    "that is , there exist many knots admitting non - trivial chirally cosmetic surgeries . from such examples",
    ", we can have cosmetic bandings on links as we will see in the rest of this paper .      according to the definitions of a mundane cosmetic surgery and an exotic cosmetic surgery , we define a mundane cosmetic banding and an exotic cosmetic banding as follows .",
    "it is well - known that a rational tangle is determined by the meridional disk in the tangle .",
    "the boundary of the meridional disk is parameterized by an element of @xmath30 , called a _",
    "slope _ of the rational tangle .",
    "a rational tangle is said to be _ integral _ if the slope is an integer or @xmath31 . for brevity",
    ", we call an integral tangle with slope @xmath26 an _ @xmath26-tangle_.    a banding can be regarded as an operation replacing a @xmath31-tangle into an @xmath26-tangle",
    ". then we call this banding a _ banding with a slope _ @xmath26 , and the @xmath32-ball corresponds to the @xmath26-tangle the _ banding ball_.    a cosmetic banding with slope @xmath26 is said to be _ mundane _ when there exists a self - homeomorphism on the exterior of the banding ball taking the slope @xmath31 to @xmath26 . a cosmetic banding which is not mundane",
    "is said to be _",
    "in this section , we introduce examples of chirally cosmetic bandings which come from a @xmath11-move operation . by these examples , one might say that examples of chirally cosmetic bandings are not difficult to find .",
    "however , all of examples of chirally cosmetic bandings introduced in this section are mundane .",
    "@xmath11-move _ on a link is a local change that involves replacing parallel lines by @xmath11 half - twists as shown in the left - hand side of figure  [ fig:4-move0 ] .",

    "the whitehead double with the blackboard framing is a knot admitting a cosmetic banding , and the @xmath38-cable is a @xmath39-component link admitting a cosmetic banding .",

    "two - bridge links with unlinking number one were determined by kohn  @xcite .",

    "note that the double - branched cover of @xmath1 along a two - bridge link is a lens space . in  @xcite , matignon gave a complete list of cosmetic surgeries on non - hyperbolic knots in lens spaces .",
    "in particular , a dehn surgery on a lens space @xmath45 along the knot , @xmath46 , the @xmath47-cable of the axis in @xmath45 is contained in his list .",

    ", we can notice that the cosmetic surgery on @xmath46 yields a cosmetic banding on the two - bridge link @xmath49 .",
    "furthermore this corresponds to the banding such that @xmath50 changes to @xmath51 .",
