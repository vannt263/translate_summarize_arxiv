    "conventional technology usually exploits the electric charge of the electron . in the last two decades ,",
    "a new technology has emerged called spintronics , which involves the active control and manipulation of the spin degree of freedom in condensed matter devices .",
    "@xcite adding the spin degree of freedom to the conventional charge - based technology has the potential advantages of multifunctionality , longer decoherence times and lengths , increased data processing speed , decreased electric power consumption , and increased integration densities compared with conventional semiconductor devices . besides being useful in contemporary technology",
    ", spintronics may also contribute to the field of quantum computation and quantum information .",
    "spin-1/2 is a natural candidate for the quantum bit ( qubit ) realization . in a spin - based quantum computer ,",
    "the information is contained in the unit vector along which the spin is polarized .",
    "writing and reading information on a spin qubit is thus equivalent to polarizing the spin along a specific direction and identifying the direction along which the spin is polarized , respectively .",
    "we distinguish between two different realizations of spin qubits , namely static and mobile qubits . in",
    "static qubit realizations the information transfer is accomplished by transferring the state of the qubit , rather than the qubit itself .",
    "for instance , if the qubits are represented by the spins of electrons localized on a quantum dot,@xcite then the information is transferred along a chain of quantum dots via exchange interactions between neighboring dots . with mobile qubits,@xcite",
    "the qubit itself is moved around the quantum circuit , carrying the information from one point to another .",
    "a major advantage of those over static ones is the ability to manipulate mobile qubits by static electric and magnetic fields in predefined regions rather than by expensive high - frequency electromagnetic pulses.@xcite here we consider mobile qubits . in ref .",
    "it has been proposed to implement a system of mobile spin qubits in a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) by using surface acoustic waves ( saw ) that capture single electrons in their potential minima and drag them through a parallel connection of @xmath0 quantum one - dimensional channels .",
    "a single quantum computation is performed by the @xmath0 electrons in a single saw minimum as they are being dragged through a pattern of magnetic and nonmagnetic quantum gates .",
    "the feasibility of this setup was demonstrated for two parallel channels ( @xmath1 ) by ebbecke _",
    "et al._.@xcite    for a quantum computation it is necessary to provide qubits in pure states .",
    "hence , a major aim of spintronics is to build mesoscopic spin valves ( or spin filters ) , which polarize the spins going through them along tunable directions . at first glance ,",
    "the easiest way to construct such devices is by using ferromagnets that inject and/or collect polarized electrons .",
    "however , the connection of ferromagnets to semiconductors is inefficient , due to a large impedance mismatch between them.@xcite a completely different approach is to use spintronic devices that do not involve ferromagnetism at all.@xcite here we discuss such filters that avoid ferromagnets .",
    "recently , several groups proposed spin filters based on a single loop , subject to both electric and magnetic fields perpendicular to the plane of the loop.@xcite an important question that has not been addressed in those studies is whether spin filtering is robust against current leakage , for example due to quantum tunnelling out of the loop . furthermore , in a practical device , with the application of finite source - drain bias voltage , the wires which connect the four dots are inevitably charged up if they are electrostatically isolated .",
    "to avoid such probably unfavorable effects , one needs to ground them , which leads to current leakage . in this paper",
    "we examine this question in the context of the diamond loop subject to both an aharonov - bohm ( ab ) flux@xcite and a spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) , discussed in our previous paper ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : diamond interferometer1]).@xcite there , we have shown that with a certain symmetry between the two branches of the diamond , and with appropriate tuning of the electric and magnetic fields ( or of the diamond shape ) , this device serves as a perfect spin filter as well as a spin analyzer .     the lossless diamond . the diamond is penetrated by a magnetic flux @xmath2 , and its edges ( of length @xmath3 ) are subject to spin - orbit interactions.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in the presence of an electric field , free electrons experience the well - known soi in vacuum,@xcite @xmath4.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath5",

    ". the related energy scale can be larger than that of eq . by as much as six orders of magnitude .",
    "two special cases of the linear ( in the momentum ) soi should be emphasized , namely the rashba soi@xcite and the dresselhaus soi.@xcite the rashba soi is a result of a confining potential well which is asymmetric under space inversion .",
    "for an electric field @xmath18 in the @xmath19 direction , this soi has the form @xmath20 the coefficient @xmath21 depends on the magnitude of @xmath22 , and can be controlled by a gate voltage , as shown in several experiments.@xcite the dresselhaus soi results from a lattice potential which lacks inversion symmetry .",
    "for a 2deg this soi is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 usually depends on the crystal structure and only weakly ( if at all ) on the external field .",
    "when a spin moves in the presence of these sois a distance @xmath3 in the direction of the unit vector @xmath25 , its spinor @xmath26 transforms into @xmath27 , with the unitary spin rotation matrix @xmath28.@xcite here , the vector @xmath29 is @xmath30 with the dimensionless coefficients @xmath31 .",
    "below we use the unitary matrix @xmath32 and the parameters @xmath33 to characterize the hopping between adjacent bonds in the presence of soi .",
    "in addition to the soi related phase , electrons also gain an ab phase @xmath34 in the presence of a magnetic flux @xmath2 penetrating the loop.@xcite when an electron goes around a loop , its wave function gains an ab phase @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the flux quantum ( @xmath37 is the electron charge).@xcite the combined effect of the soi and the ab flux is to transform the spinor @xmath26 of an electron that goes around a loop into @xmath38 , where the unitary matrix @xmath39 is of the form @xmath40 here @xmath41 ( @xmath42 is the @xmath43 unit matrix ) is the diagonal transformation matrix due to the ab flux and @xmath44 is the transformation matrix due to the soi .",
    "the latter is a product of matrices of the form @xmath45 discussed above , each coming from the local soi on a segment of the loop.@xcite    in the present paper we study the sensitivity of the spin filter to leakage of currents from the branches of the interferometer . to model",
    "this leakage , we generalize the diamond interferometer shown in fig . [",
    "fig : diamond interferometer1 ] by allowing for an arbitrary number of tight - binding sites along each edge of the diamond .",
    "each site is connected to a one - dimensional lead , which allows only an outgoing current to an absorbing reservoir ( see fig . [",
    "fig : diamond interferometer2 ] and a detailed description below).@xcite we calculate the spin - dependent transmission through the diamond and thus generalize the results of ref . to include the effects of the leakage .",
    "we show that the diamond interferometer may still serve as a perfect spin filter and spin analyzer , even in the presence of current leakage . with slight modifications , the requirements for the symmetry between the two branches and for a specific relation between the ab flux and the soi strength , derived in ref . , are preserved .",
    "there we presented conditions for achieving this symmetry independent of the electrons energy .",
    "these conditions were quite difficult to be realized . here",
    "we show that under linear - response conditions , when all the electrons have the same fermi energy , it is relatively easy to achieve this symmetry by tuning a single gate voltage on one of the interferometer branches .",
    "furthermore , we show that once the filtering conditions are obeyed , the blocked polarization and the polarization of the outgoing electrons are not affected by the current leakage , being the same as for the lossless diamond .",

    "since the hopping matrices @xmath64 depend only on the ab and soi phases , the directions @xmath137 and @xmath177 are determined solely by these phases and are not affected by the current leakage .",
    "hence , the blocked and transmitted directions can be manipulated by the external electric and magnetic fields .    from eq .",
    "it follows that @xmath178 and the equality @xmath170 holds only if @xmath179 we now discuss these two conditions .    the first condition in eqs",
    "can be interpreted as a requirement for a symmetry relation between the two paths .",

    "however , it is not obvious that such a tuning of the parameters can be realized in an experimental setup .",
    "alternatively , one can work in the linear - response regime , where all the electrons have the same energy , equal to the fermi energy of the leads .",

    "namely @xmath188 , imposes a relation between the ab flux and the soi strength .",
    "we remind the reader that @xmath148 , with @xmath189 and @xmath190 being the phases of @xmath116 and @xmath117 , respectively .",
    "this should be compared with the condition @xmath191 , derived for the lossless diamond.@xcite as emphasized in ref .",
    ", this relation for the lossless diamond depends neither on the electron energy @xmath180 , nor on the site energies , since @xmath34 and @xmath192 depend only on the unitary matrices @xmath193 . in the lossy diamond , on the other hand",
    ", the relation @xmath188 generally depends both on the electron energy and on the site energies [ since @xmath116 and @xmath117 depend on these parameters , see eqs . ] . however , with one of the choices or , the two paths are completely symmetric , so that @xmath189=@xmath190 and the relation between the ab flux and the soi strength becomes identical to that of the lossless diamond .",
    "alternatively , working in the linear - response regime , one has to tune experimentally the ab flux to satisfy the condition @xmath194 for specific values of @xmath189 and @xmath190 ( which are determined by the fermi energy of the leads and by the various hopping amplitudes , site energies and leakage parameters ) . for further details ,",
    "see the appendix .",
    "finally , we comment on the magnitude of the transmission of the polarized electrons through the filter . since one does not expect the tight - binding model to be valid near the band edges , we confine ourselves to the center of the band , @xmath195 or @xmath196 , where the details of the model chosen are not so important . in the lossless diamond , it was shown in ref .",

    "[ fig : transmission ] , several differences can be detected .",
    "first , the maximal transmission of the lossy diamond is less than one .",
    "this is an obvious effect of the lossy diamond , since part of the incident current leaks into the absorbing channels .",
    "this leakage increases as the tunnelling from the diamond edges to each absorbing channel , represented by @xmath60 , increases or when the number of absorbing channels @xmath213 increases .",
    "second , fig .",
    "[ fig : transmission vs flux ] shows that the maximal transmission is not obtained for @xmath199 but for a flux slightly larger than @xmath205 .",
    "third , in fig .",
    "[ fig : transmission vs k ] we see that the transmission as a function of @xmath210 is much narrower than that of the lossless case .",
    "we have generalized the results of the single - diamond interferometer made of materials with significant sois and penetrated by an ab flux , discussed in ref .",
    ", to the case where losses are present .",
    "in particular , we have considered losses due to a current leakage out of the diamond into absorbing channels , modelled as 1d tight - binding chains .",
    "our calculations show that spin filtering ( and consequently also spin reading ) can be achieved even in the presence of current leakage .",
    "the filtering conditions found in ref . , namely the condition for a symmetry relation between the two branches @xmath214 and the relation between the ab phase and the soi phase @xmath215 are modified . in the lossy diamond @xmath116 and @xmath117 are complex numbers and the first condition takes the form @xmath216 . since @xmath116 and @xmath117 depend on the various parameters ( leakage parameters @xmath60 , hopping amplitudes @xmath65 , electron energy @xmath180 and site energies @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) in a complicated manner , it is difficult to derive general analytical relations between these parameters from this condition .",
    "the solution simplifies for the completely symmetric diamond [ eqs . and ] for which the condition @xmath216 is trivially satisfied .",
    "the second condition , @xmath217 , is still valid provided that @xmath34 is replaced by @xmath148 , with @xmath189 and @xmath190 being the phases of @xmath116 and @xmath117 , respectively . for the completely symmetric diamond one has @xmath218 and this condition is the same as for the lossless diamond . an alternative way to satisfy the filtering conditions",
    "is by working in the linear - response regime . in that regime ,",
    "transport of electrons occurs at the fermi energy of the leads .",
    "the filtering conditions can then be satisfied simultaneously by tuning the ab flux and one of the site energies @xmath219 or @xmath220 .",
    "once the filtering conditions are obeyed , the transmitted electrons are fully polarized .",
    "the effects of the leakage on the transmission can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the maximal transmission in the lossy diamond is always smaller than one and the maximum decreases with increasing leakage parameters or with increasing length of each edge of the diamond .",
    "2 .   viewed as a function of the flux @xmath34 , the transmission of the lossy diamond",
    "is shifted to slightly higher fluxes relative to the transmission of the lossless diamond , while viewed as a function of @xmath210 , the transmission of the lossy diamond is narrower than the transmission of the lossless diamond .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that quantities which depend only on the hopping matrices @xmath221 , are not affected by the leakage .",
    "for instance , the dependence of the soi phase @xmath192 on the soi strength and on the geometry of the diamond ( through the opening angle @xmath51 ) is the same as in the lossless diamond and so are the directions @xmath131 and @xmath159 of the filtered and the transmitted electrons .",
    "analytical expressions for the soi phase and for the blocked and transmitted spinors in the lossless diamond have been obtained in ref . for the rashba - only soi and for both rashba and dresselhaus soi.@xcite",
    "those expressions thus remain valid for the lossy diamond .    in conclusion , while the filtering conditions are slightly modified , many of the device properties remain the same as in the lossless case .",
    "these properties can be manipulated by external electric and magnetic fields and are insensitive to the current leakage in the framework of the model presented here .",
    "we have pointed out that realizing a symmetric interferometer in the experiment may be a difficult task .",
    "we have mentioned that the filtering conditions can be fulfilled for an arbitrary asymmetric interferometer by working in the linear - response regime .",
    "let us assume that the fermi energy of the leads lies at the center of the tight - binding band ( i.e.  @xmath222 or @xmath196 ) .",
    "then , one can satisfy the first condition in eqs .",
    "( with @xmath195 ) by tuning only the site energy @xmath56 .",
