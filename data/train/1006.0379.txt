    "rate - adaptive solutions such as adaptive modulation and incremental redundancy have proven to be very effective at increasing the spectral efficiency of wireless systems operating over a variety of channels @xcite .",
    "these techniques allow mobile communications systems to operate efficiently over a wide range of channel parameters while maintaining a target bit error rate ( ber ) , as opposed to a non - rate - adaptive system which is designed for a worst - case `` fixed - rate '' channel . in a traditional implementation of adaptive modulation @xcite , the transmitter dynamically adjusts the current level of modulation based on feedback of the observed channel state information ( csi ) from the receiver .",
    "the requirement of csi at the transmitter is one of the major impediments of adaptive modulation systems , especially for a high - speed mobile receiver for which the channel information changes rapidly .",
    "incremental redundancy @xcite systems do not require csi at the transmitter , but instead encode data packets using a low - rate `` mother code '' and break the message into smaller sub - packets , sending them one - by - one until the receiver acquires enough packets to successfully decode the message .",
    "these systems require the receiver to decode after each sub - packet is received to check for successful transmission and also require a buffer large enough ( in poor channel conditions ) to accommodate the entire collection of sub - packets , meaning that the complexity of the decoding operation varies with the quality of the channel .",
    "adaptive demodulation ( adm ) , first proposed in @xcite and with the expanded framework in @xcite , offers a new rate - adaptive solution that avoids the need for csi at the transmitter ( unlike adaptive modulation ) , has a fixed buffer size ( roughly equal to the size of the message ) , and requires the receiver to perform a decoding operation only once ( unlike incremental redundancy ) . in an adm system , the transmitter sends data at a fixed - rate using a standard constellation and the receiver demodulates data at a non - fixed - rate using appropriately designed sets of decision regions chosen based on the csi observed by the receiver . before transmission",
    ", each @xmath0-bit message is encoded using a rateless erasure code ( e.g. the luby transform ( lt ) code @xcite or the raptor code @xcite ) . to recover any @xmath0-bit message ,",
    "the receiver simply buffers the demodulated ( non - erased ) bits until it has accumulated @xmath1 `` reliable '' bits ( where @xmath2 is a small fixed quantity ) at which point the original message can be decoded , regardless of the erasure pattern introduced in the message . in @xcite ,",
    "the adm - based receiver uses sets of specially designed decision regions to demodulate some or all of the bits in a transmitted symbol ( depending upon the desired level of reliability ) , and assumes a `` coherent phase reference '' is available at the receiver .",
    "the optimal constellations and mappings for the adm system over an additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel and its performance for awgn were derived in @xcite .",
    "particular instances of the adm solution are the application studies considered in @xcite and @xcite for gaussian relay channels .    in this paper",
    ", we consider how to implement the adm system using differentially coherent detection : an attractive alternative when a reliable phase reference is not available .",
    "this is certainly a valid and interesting problem when the channel changes rapidly making phase coherence difficult or expensive to achieve .",
    "there are several works in the literature that study the performance analysis of differentially coherent detection in wireless rf applications ( e.g. , @xcite ) with focus on mobile satellite communications @xcite , and optical communication systems @xcite .",
    "of interest is to utilize the differential phase - shift keying ( dpsk ) in mobile communications systems which commonly circumvents the ambiguity in the phase recovery @xcite .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , this is the first paper addressing this rate - adaptive technique with focus on differentially coherent detection in time - varying wireless systems .",
    "this paper studies the design and performance analysis of a hard - decision version of the adm scheme for two common differentially coherent schemes : m - dpsk and m - dapsk ( m - ary differential amplitude and phase shift keying ) operating over awgn and rayleigh fading channels .",
    "the paper makes the following contributions :    * the optimal method for determining the most reliable bits for a given differential detection scheme is presented .",
    "* simple ( near - optimal ) implementations are provided for recovering the most reliable bits from a received pair of differentially encoded symbols for systems using 16-dpsk and 16-dapsk .",
    "the new receivers offer the advantages of a rate - adaptive system , without requiring csi at the transmitter and a coherent phase reference at the receivers . * bit error analysis for the adm system in both cases is presented along with numerical results of the spectral efficiency for the rate - adaptive systems operating over a rayleigh fading channel .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ system_model ] provides an overview of the system under consideration and briefly introduces some adm concepts and terminology .",
    "section [ optimal decision_dpsk ] presents the optimal method for determining the most reliable bits for a given differential detection scheme in the adm - based system with 16-dpsk . with a similar argument as for the dpsk - adm system model , section [ optimal decision_dapsk ] deals with a simple ( near - optimal ) implementation for recovering the most reliable 1 , 2 , 3 , or 4 bits from a received pair of differentially encoded symbols for systems using 16-dapsk .",
    "sections [ optimal decision_dpsk ] and [ optimal decision_dapsk ] also include the log - likelihood ratio ( llr ) computation of each bit for every pair of received symbols .",
    "section [ performance ] includes the probability of error analysis for the near - optimal detection schemes and presents the spectral efficiency of adm using differential detection .",

    "[ t ]     in this work , we consider an adm - based single - hop wireless system depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : adm_tx_rx ] , where the transmitter desires to send data packets of equal length toward the corresponding receiver using a predetermined rateless code and differential encoding . to send a @xmath0-bit data packet , the transmitter first encodes it using an lt ( luby transform ) code to produce a stream of coded bits .",
    "such codes are a class of sparse - graph `` rateless '' erasure codes which are fully explained in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that lt codes offer strong benefits in using in practical wireless networking applications with dynamic distance and position nodes .",
    "lt codes have a very simple encoding mechanism that allows the transmitter to produce a potentially limitless sequence of encoded bits from the original @xmath0 message bits . once the receiver successfully recovers any @xmath1 reliable encoded bits  where @xmath2 is determined by the reliability of the recovered bits  a message passing decoder using the _ sum - product algorithm _ @xcite , can be used to recover the original @xmath0-bit message .",

    "* dpsk : * after matched filtering , a sample of a 16-dpsk symbol at the receiver can be written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 represents a transmitted symbol with phase @xmath10 and normalized symbol energy , @xmath11 represents the arbitrary ( and unknown ) phase introduced by the channel , and @xmath12 is a zero - mean circularly - symmetric complex gaussian random variable with variance @xmath13 in each dimension .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath11 is constant over at least two symbol intervals such that @xmath14 .",
    "in addition , we denote the phase difference between consecutive 16-dpsk symbols @xmath15 and @xmath16 by @xmath17    * dapsk : * similarly , adopting a notation akin to @xcite , we denote two consecutive received 16-dapsk symbols ( the @xmath18 and @xmath19 symbols ) as follows : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a complex quantity representing the magnitude and the phase of the @xmath18 symbol , @xmath22 is a complex quantity representing the change in magnitude and phase from the @xmath18 to the @xmath19 symbol , and @xmath12 and @xmath23 are independent gaussian noise samples as above .",
    "we note that @xmath24 can take on one of only two values : @xmath25 or @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is defined as the _ ring ratio _ in 16-dapsk .",
    "the symbol energy is assumed to be normalized such that @xmath28 .",
    "the change in magnitude , @xmath29 , can be one of three values : @xmath30 , 1 , or @xmath31 .",

    "transmitted based on the observation of two consecutive differentially encoded symbols as will be described in the subsequent sections .",
    "indeed , the receiver uses the instantaneous signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) to determine which @xmath40-ds to use to demodulate a pair of symbols in order to maintain a given ber , @xmath41 , as a standard of reliability . for the above scheme ,",
    "non - demodulated ( unreliable ) bits are erased .",
    "demodulated ( reliable ) bits are buffered until the receiver has collected sufficient bits for decoding at which point the decoder returns the decoded @xmath0-bit message .",
    "for a particular pair of differentially encoded symbols , the @xmath40 most reliable bits in the output of the @xmath40-ds should be the @xmath40 bits with the largest magnitude log likelihood ratios ( llrs ) .",
    "thus , the `` optimal '' @xmath40-ds is a device that computes the llrs of each bit for every pair of received symbols , compares their magnitudes , and chooses the @xmath40 bits with the largest llrs .",

    "it is revealed from ( [ bessel01 ] ) that only the bessel term of @xmath50 is a function of @xmath51 , thus allowing us to cancel the exponential leading terms that would appear in an expansion of ( [ llr01 ] ) .",

    "using the fact that @xmath91 and @xmath54 are both monotonic increasing , it can be shown that this comparison reduces to the following simple decision rules : @xmath92    using the decision rules in ( [ eqn : dpsk_decision1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : dpsk_decision2 ] ) , it is a simple matter to determine the @xmath40-dss to recover the most likely 1 , 2 , and 3 bits for each pair of 16-dpsk symbols .",

    "recalling the notation from ( [ dapsk01 ] ) and ( [ dapsk02 ] ) , the standard method used to demodulate 16-dapsk is to compute the decision statistics @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",

    "this simplifies the decision schemes since the analysis can be confined to values of @xmath106 contained within the unit circle .",
    "intuitively , it makes sense that @xmath95 and @xmath104 would lead to the same reliability since it should not matter the order we transition from one ring to the other ( since either way we will have one point on the large ring and one on the small ring ) .",
