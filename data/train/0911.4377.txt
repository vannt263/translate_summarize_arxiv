    "we consider an admissible graph @xmath273 in @xmath233 and the corresponding operator @xmath269 : the degree of the operator - valued form @xmath274 equals the number of derivations acting on the different entries associated to vertices either of the first or second type .",
    "thus , the operator @xmath269 has a polynomial part ( since all structures are involved are polynomial on @xmath258 ) : since the polynomial part of any of its arguments in @xmath133 has degree @xmath26 , the polynomial degree of @xmath271 must be also @xmath26 .",
    "a direct computation shows that this condition is satisfied if and only if @xmath275 , because @xmath238 is linear .    obviously , the previous identity is never satisfied if @xmath251 , which implies immediately that the only non - trivial taylor components appear when @xmath249 and @xmath276 . when @xmath249 , the previous equality forces @xmath277 : there is only one admissible graph @xmath273 in @xmath278 , whose corresponding operator is non - trivial , namely ,            we consider the expression @xmath281 .",
    "degree reasons imply that the sum of the degrees of the elements @xmath177 equals @xmath174 ; furthermore , if the degree of some @xmath177 is strictly bigger than @xmath74 , the previous equality forces a different @xmath98 to have degree @xmath26 , whence the corresponding expression vanishes by proposition  [ p - kosz ] , @xmath282 .",
    "hence , the degree of each @xmath177 is precisely @xmath74 .",
    "we now consider a general graph @xmath273 with @xmath153 vertices of the first type and @xmath283 ordered vertices of the second type ; to each vertex of the first type is associated a copy of @xmath13 , while to the ordered vertices of the second type are associated @xmath176 , @xmath74 and the @xmath177s in lexicographical order .",
    "we denote by @xmath284 the number of edges departing from the @xmath153 vertices of the first type and hitting the first vertex of the second type ( observe that in this situation edges departing from vertices of the first type can only hit vertices of the first type or the first vertex of the second type ) : in the present framework , edges have only one color ( we refer to  ( * ? ? ? *",

    "we now compute the polynomial degree of the multidifferential operator associated to the graph @xmath273 : it equals @xmath287 , where @xmath288 is the number of edges from the last @xmath174 vertices of the second type hitting vertices of the first type .",
    "the first @xmath153 comes from the fact that @xmath0 is a linear bivector field . as @xmath289 and @xmath286",
    ", it follows immediately @xmath290 and @xmath291 , _",
    "i.e. _ the edges departing from the last @xmath174 vertices of the second type all hit the first vertex of the second type , and from each vertex of the first type departs exactly one edge hitting the first vertex of the second type ; the remaining @xmath153 edges must hit a vertex of the first type .    in summary ,",
    "a general graph @xmath273 appearing in @xmath292 is the disjoint union of wheel - like graphs @xmath293 , @xmath61 , and of the graph @xmath294 , @xmath295 ; such graphs are depicted in figure 4 .",
    "observe that the @xmath74-wheel @xmath296 appears here explicitly because of the presence of short loops in the @xmath44 brane formality theorem  @xcite : the integral weight of the @xmath74-wheel has been computed in  @xcite and equals @xmath297 , while the corresponding translation invariant differential operator is the trace of the adjoint representation of @xmath256 .",
    "any multiple of @xmath298 defines a constant vector field on @xmath258 : either as an easy consequence of the formality theorem of kontsevich  @xcite or by an explicit computation using stokes theorem , @xmath299 is a derivation of @xmath300 , where @xmath8 is the deformed product on @xmath162 _ via _ kontsevich s deformation quantization .",
    "the integral weight of the graph @xmath294 is @xmath301 and the corresponding multidifferential operator is simply the symmetrization morphism ; the integral weight of the wheel - like graph @xmath293 , @xmath244 , has been computed in  @xcite ( observe that , except the case @xmath277 , the integral weights of @xmath293 for @xmath153 odd vanish ) and equal the modified bernoulli numbers , and the corresponding translation - invariant differential operators are @xmath302 .      therefore , the isomorphism @xmath255 ( for @xmath303 ) equals the composition of the pbw isomorphism from @xmath304 to @xmath305 with duflo s strange automorphism ; the derivation @xmath306 of the deformed algebra @xmath307 is exponentiated to an automorphism of the same algebra .",

    "the main feature of the quadratic case is the degree @xmath26 homogeneity of the poisson bivector field , which reflects itself in the homogeneity of all structure maps .",
