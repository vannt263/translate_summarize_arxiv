    "almost 20% of the extrasolar planets detected so far orbit at a distance between 0.038 and 0.1 astronomical unit ( au ) from their host star .",
    "it is very unlikely that these short  period giant planets , also called hot jupiters , have formed _ in situ _ ( bodenheimer 1998 ; bodenheimer , hubickyj & lissauer 1999 ) .",
    "more likely , they have formed further away in the protoplanetary nebula and have migrated down to small orbital distances .",
    "it is also possible that migration and formation were concurrent ( papaloizou & terquem 1999 ) .    so far",
    ", three mechanisms have been proposed to explain the location of planets at very short orbital distances .",
    "one of them relies on the gravitational interaction between two or more giant planets , which may lead to orbit crossing and to the ejection of one planet while the other is left in a smaller orbit ( rasio & ford 1996 ; weidenschilling & marzari 1996 ) .",
    "however , this mechanism can not account for the relatively large number of hot jupiters observed .",
    "another mechanism is the so  called migration instability ( murray et al . 1998",
    "; malhotra 1993 ) .",
    "it involves resonant interactions between the planet and planetesimals located inside its orbit which lead to the ejection of a fraction of them while simultaneously causing the planet to migrate inward .",
    "although such interactions may lead to the migration of giant planets on small scales , they would require a very massive disc to move a jupiter mass planet from several astronomical units down to very small radii .",
    "such a massive disc is unlikely and furthermore it would be only marginally gravitationally stable .",
    "the third mechanism , that we are going to focus on here , involves the tidal interaction between the protoplanet and the gas in the surrounding protoplanetary nebula ( goldreich & tremaine 1979 , 1980 ; lin & papaloizou 1979 , 1993 and references therein ; papaloizou & lin 1984 ; ward 1986 , 1997 ) . here again the protoplanet can move significantly only if there is at least a comparable mass of gas within a radius comparable to that of its orbit .",
    "however this is not a problem since this amount of gas is needed anyway in the first place to form the planet .",
    "note that hot jupiters can also be produced by the dynamical relaxation of a population of planets on inclined orbits , formed through gravitational instabilities of a circumstellar envelope or a thick disc ( papaloizou & terquem 2001 ) .",
    "however , if objects as heavy as @xmath2boo may be produced _ via _ fragmentation , it is unlikely that lower mass objects would form that way .",
    "a planet embedded in a gaseous disc launches density waves at the lindblad resonances ( goldreich & tremaine 1979 , hereafter gt79 ) .",
    "the torque exerted by the planet on these waves is responsible for the exchange of angular momentum between the disc rotation and the planet s orbital motion .",
    "the interaction between the planet and the disc inside / outside its orbit leads to a negative / positive torque on the disc , and therefore to a gain / loss of angular momentum for the planet . in the linear regime , because in a ( even uniform ) keplerian disc the outer lindblad resonances are slightly closer to the planet than the inner lindblad resonances , the interaction with the outer parts of the disc leads to a larger lindblad torque than that with the inner parts ( ward 1986 , 1997 ) .",
    "therefore , the net lindblad torque exerted by the planet causes it to lose angular momentum and to move inward relative to the gas ( type  i migration ) .",
    "note that there is also a torque exerted by the planet on the material which corotates with the perturbation .",
    "its sign depends on the gradient of vortensity at corotation ( gt79 ) .",
    "however , it is usually found to be less significant than the net lindblad torque .",
    "the drift timescale for a 110  m@xmath3 planet undergoing type  i migration in a standard gaseous disc is typically between @xmath4 and @xmath5  years , shorter than the disc lifetime or estimated planetary formation timescales .",
    "when the mass of the planet becomes large enough , the perturbation becomes nonlinear .",
    "feedback torques from the disc on the planet , which have to be taken into account in this regime , then opposes the motion of the planet and stops it altogether when the planet is massive enough ( ward 1997 ) .",
    "however , density waves still transport angular momentum outward .",
    "if they are dissipated locally , the angular momentum they transport is deposited in the disc in the vicinity of the planet and a gap may be cleared out ( goldreich & tremaine 1980 ; lin & papaloizou 1979 , 1993 and references therein ) .",
    "the planet is then locked into the angular momentum transport process of the disc , and migrates inward at a rate controlled by the disc viscous timescale ( type  ii migration ) . here",
    "again , the drift timescale is rather short , being in the range @xmath6@xmath7  years for standard parameters .",
    "type  ii migration , which occurs for planets with masses at least comparable to that of jupiter , can be avoided if after the planet forms there is not enough mass left in the disc to absorb its angular momentum .",
    "however , type  i migration appears inevitable as there has to be enough gas in the disc to push a forming core inward if this core is to accrete a massive envelope to become a giant planet at some point .",
    "different scenarii for stopping a planet undergoing inward migration have been considered ( see , e.g. , terquem , papaloizou & nelson 2000 and references therein ) , but none of them can satisfactorily explain the presence of extrasolar planets with semi  major axes from a few 0.01  au all the way up to several au .",
    "recently , papaloizou ( 2002 ) has shown that type  i migration reverses for reasonable disc models once the eccentricity of the orbit becomes comparable to the disc aspect ratio .",
    "this is because in that case the planet spends more time near apocentre , where it is being speeded up , than near pericentre , where it is being slowed down .",
    "although the interaction with the disc tends to circularize the orbit of the planet ( goldreich & tremaine 1980 ) , significant eccentricity may be maintained by gravitational interactions between different planets forming simultaneously ( papaloizou & larwood 2000 ) .",
    "here we investigate the effect of a magnetic field on planet migration in the linear regime .",
    "we consider a planet on a circular orbit and , to keep the problem tractable , restrict ourselves to the case of a purely toroidal field .",
    "this tends to be the dominant component in discs as it is produced by the shearing of radial field lines .",
    "as described above , the torque exerted by a planet on a disc depends mainly on the location of the radii where the perturbation is in resonance with the free oscillations of the disc .",
    "we therefore expect a magnetic field to modify the tidal torque , as it introduces more degrees of freedom in the disc .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sections  [ sec : basic ]",
    ", [ sec : equilibrium ] and  [ sec : potential ] we give the basic equations , describe the equilibrium disc model and give the expression of the perturbing potential acting on the disc . in section  [ sec : response ] we study the disc response to this perturbing potential .",
    "we first linearize the equations and derive the second order differential equation describing the disc response (   [ sec : linearization ] ) .",
    "we then carry on a wkb analysis (   [ sec : wkb ] ) , which shows that magnetosonic waves propagate outside the outermost turning points . in ",
    "[ sec : magneticres ] we study the disc response at the locations where it is singular .",
    "we call these radii",
    "_ magnetic resonances_. there are two such resonances , located on each side of the planet s orbit and within the lindblad resonances . in   [ sec : turning ] we calculate all the turning points associated with the disc response . on each side of the planet",
    "there are two or three of them , depending on the value of the azimuthal number @xmath8 .",
    "one of these turning points concide with the lindblad resonance .",
    "in contrast to the nonmagnetic case , waves are found to propagate in a restricted region inside the outermost turning points , around the magnetic resonances .",
    "we then proceed to give an expression for the tidal torque in general and in the vicinity of the magnetic resonances in particular in section  [ sec : torque ] .",
    "numerical calculations of the torque exerted by the planet on the disc are presented in section  [ sec : numerics ] .",
    "we show that the torque exerted in the vicinity of the magnetic resonances tends to dominate the disc response when the magnetic field is large enough .",
    "this torque , like the lindblad torque , is negative inside the planet s orbit and positive outside the orbit .",
    "therefore , if @xmath9 increases fast enough with radius , the outer magnetic resonance becomes less important ( it disappears altogether when there is no magnetic field outside the planet s orbit ) and the total torque becomes negative , dominated by the inner magnetic resonance .",
    "this corresponds to a positive torque on the planet , which leads to outward migration .",
    "finally , we discuss our results in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the disc is described by the equation of motion :    @xmath10    the equation of continuity :    @xmath11    and the induction equation in the ideal mhd approximation :    @xmath12    where    @xmath13    is the lorentz force per unit volume , @xmath14 the pressure , @xmath15 the mass density , @xmath16 the flow velocity , @xmath17 the gravitational potential and @xmath18 the magnetic field ( @xmath19 is the permeability of vacuum ) .",

    "( note that for @xmath330 the lindblad resonances concide with the outermost turning points ) .",
    "we have found above that the point  like torque exerted at the inner magnetic resonance is positive whereas that exerted at the outer resonance is negative .",
    "therefore , the torque is not dominated by the point  like contribution at the magnetic resonances , but is determined by the whole region around these resonances , where waves propagate for @xmath362 ( see also the discussion in section  [ sec : torquereson ] ) .",
    "when @xmath138 decreases , @xmath88 increases outward faster , so that the magnetic field becomes less and less important outside the planet s orbit .",

    "the net effect of decreasing @xmath138 is then to decrease the total torque .",
    "if the magnetic field is strong enough , the total torque exerted on the disc is dominated by the region inside the lindblad resonances ( which is closer to the planet than the regions outside these resonances ) , and it can then become negative for small enough values of @xmath138 .    figure  [ fig8 ] shows the total torque exerted by the planet on the disc versus @xmath8 for @xmath327 , @xmath355 ( @xmath329 ) , @xmath349 , which correspond to @xmath350 , and different values of @xmath363 . as we can see , the cumulative torque @xmath342 is significantly decreased for values of @xmath363 as large as @xmath364 and becomes negative for values of @xmath363 between @xmath364 and 10 .    the cumulative torque corresponding to @xmath365 becomes negative if , for the same parameters as above , @xmath141 is taken to be at least as large as unity , i.e. if @xmath24 increases with radius at least as fast as linearly .",
    "this is because when @xmath141 increases @xmath88 increases faster with radius , which favours the negative inner torque exerted near corotation .",
    "this effect can be seen in figure  [ fig6 ] by comparing the upper and middle panels , which show that the total torque corresponding to @xmath331 is larger than that corresponding to @xmath327 for @xmath349 .",
    "note that @xmath366 tends to favour the outer lindblad resonance compared to the inner one , which results in a larger lindblad torque ( ward 1986 , 1997 ) .",
    "the fact that the total torque actually decreases when @xmath141 increases means that the variations of @xmath24 affect more significantly the torque exerted around the magnetic resonances than the lindblad torque .",

    "an increase of @xmath140 ( corresponding to @xmath26 or , equivalently , @xmath128 , increasing faster with radius ) also results in a smaller total torque , as can be seen by comparing the upper and lower panels of figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "when @xmath140 gets larger , @xmath88 increases faster with radius , which again lowers the torque exerted around the magnetic resonances .",
    "also the lindblad torque is reduced when @xmath140 gets larger ( ward 1986 , 1997 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig9 ] shows the effect of varying the value of @xmath367 at @xmath55 for @xmath330 , @xmath327 , @xmath329 , @xmath357 and @xmath349 and 3 . the total torque exerted on the disc tends to zero as @xmath128 increases .",
    "this is because the resonances are further away from the planet when @xmath128 is larger , so that the coupling between the perturbation and the tidal potential is weaker . for @xmath349 ,",

    "this is because even though @xmath88 increases with radius in that case , the region between the inner lindblad resonance and corotation contributes to a larger magnitude of the torque than the region between corotation and the outer lindblad resonances .",
    "this is also the case for @xmath232 and @xmath370 , as shown in table  [ tab1 ] .",

    "waves propagate outside the outermost turning points .",
    "but here they also propagate inside the intermediate turning points when @xmath254 , or between the intermediate and innermost turning points when @xmath248 ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",

    "there is a significant torque exerted on the region of the disc inside the outermost turning points ( which concide with the lindblad resonances for the values of @xmath8 of interest ) . like the lindblad torque ,",
    "this torque is negative inside the planet s orbit and positive outside its orbit .",
    "the whole region around corotation , not just a narrow zone around the magnetic resonances , contribute to this torque . in other words ,",
    "the magnetic resonances contribute to a global , not a point - like , torque . since these resonances are closer to the planet than the lindblad resonances , they couple more strongly to the tidal potential .",
    "therefore , the torque exerted around the magnetic resonances dominate over the lindblad torque if the magnetic field is large enough .",
    "if in addition @xmath0 increases fast enough with radius , the outer magnetic resonance becomes less important ( it disappears altogether when there is no magnetic field outside the planet s orbit ) and the total torque is then negative , dominated by the inner magnetic resonance .",
    "this corresponds to a positive torque on the planet , which leads to outward migration .",
    "the amount by which @xmath88 has to increase outward for the total torque exerted on the disc to be negative depends mainly on the magnitude of @xmath88 . we have found that for @xmath372 at corotation , the cumulative torque ( obtained by summing up the contributions from all the values of @xmath8 ) exerted on the disc is negative when @xmath88 increases at least as fast as @xmath373 .",

    "the migration timescales that correspond to the torques calculated above are rather short .",
    "the orbital decay timescale of a planet of mass @xmath378 at radius @xmath37 is @xmath379 , where @xmath380 is the cumulative torque exerted by the planet on the disc . remembering that @xmath381",

    "once the planet migrates outward out of the region where @xmath88 increases with radius , it may enter a region where @xmath88 behaves differently and then resume inward migration for instance .",
    "such a situation would be expected to occur in a turbulent magnetized disc in which the large scale field structure changes sufficiently slowly .    unless the magnetic field is above equipartition , it is unstable by the magnetorotational instability ( balbus & hawley 1991 , 1998 and references therein ) , the saturated nonlinear outcome of which is mhd turbulence . in a turbulent magnetized disc ,",
    "the main component of the field is toroidal , as shown by numerical simulations ( hawley , gammie & balbus 1995 ; brandenburg et al .",
    "global simulations have also shown that the turbulence saturates at a level corresponding to @xmath1 if there is no mean flux or to lower values of @xmath88 if there is a mean flux ( hawley 2001 ; steinacker & papaloizou 2002 ) .",
    "also , substantial spatial inhomogeneities are created by radial variations of the maxwell stress ( hawley 2001 ; steinacker & papaloizou 2002 ) , so that the field may display significant gradients . on the basis of the work presented here , we are led to speculate that in such a disc the planet would suffer alternately inward and outward migration , or even no migration at all .",
    "it would then oscillates back and forth in some region of the disc , or undergo some kind of diffusive migration , either outward or inward depending on the field gradients encountered .",
    "note however that in a turbulent disc the magnetic field may vary locally on timescales shorter than the timescales needed to establish the type of tidal response assumed in this paper .",
    "it has been pointed out that protoplanetary discs may be ionized enough for the magnetic field to couple to the matter only in their innermost and outermost parts ( gammie 1996 ; fromang , terquem & balbus 2002 ) . a planet forming at around one astronomical unit , where the ionization fraction is very low , would then migrate inward on the timescale calculated by ward ( 1986 , 1997 ) until it reaches smaller radii where the field is coupled to the matter . at this point",
    ", there would be a magnetic field inside the planet s orbit but not outside its orbit .",
    "the torque on the planet would then reverse , and outward migration would occur .",
    "however , as soon as the planet would re  enter the nonmagnetic region , inward migration would resume . hence , the planet would stall at the border between the magnetic and nonmagnetic regions .",
    "inward migration in a magnetized disc may then either be very significantly slowed down , occur only on limited scales , or not occur at all .",
    "the planet would then be able to grow to become a terrestrial planet or the core of a giant planet .    when the planet becomes massive enough ( about 10 earth masses ) , the interaction with the disc becomes nonlinear , with a gap being opened up around the planet s orbit . because a rather strong torque is exerted in the vicinity of the planet in the presence of a magnetic field , a gap should open up more easily and be cleaner in a turbulent magnetic disc than in a similar laminar viscous disc .",
    "this seems to be in agreement with the numerical simulations of a giant planet in a turbulent disc performed by nelson & papaloizou ( 2002 ) .",
    "once the gap is completely cleared out , the effect of the magnetic resonances disappear as they are inside the edges of the gap ( which concide with the lindblad resonances corresponding to @xmath388 ) .",
    "the magnetic field may however still have an effect on the disc  planet interaction because of the turbulence it produces ( nelson & papaloizou 2002 ) .",
    "we have focused here on a planet with a circular orbit .",
    "a planet on an eccentric orbit in a nonmagnetic disc usually suffers eccentricity damping , as in that case the corotation resonances , which damp the eccentricity , dominate over the lindblad resonances , which excite it ( goldreich & tremaine 1980 ; papaloizou , nelson & masset 2001 ) .",
    "this picture may change once a magnetic field is introduced .",
    "the effect of a magnetic field on the eccentricity of a planet will be studied in another paper .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank steven balbus and john papaloizou for their advice , encouragement , and many valuable suggestions and discussions .",
    "i am grateful to john papaloizou for his comments on an early draft of this paper which led to significant improvements .",
