    "it is well known that up to conjugacy primitive generators in a rank two free group can be indexed by the rational numbers and that pairs of primitives that generate the group can be obtained by the number theory of the farey tessellation of the hyperbolic plane .",

    "[ remark : nbs ] if @xmath65 then it is a simple computation to see that @xmath66 and that both pairs of fractions @xmath67 are farey neighbors if @xmath68 are .",
    "it is easy to calculate that the euclidean distance between finite farey neighbors is strictly less than one unless they are adjacent integers .",
    "this implies that unless one of the fractions is @xmath69 , both neighbors have the same sign .",
    "one creates the farey diagram in the upper half - plane by marking each fraction by a point on the real line and joining each pair of farey neighbors by a semi - circle orthogonal to the real line .",
    "the point here is that because of the above properties none of the semi - circles intersect in the upper half plane .",
    "this gives a tessellation of the hyperbolic plane where the semi - circles joining a pair of neighbors , together with the semi - circles joining each member of that pair to the farey sum of the pair , form an ideal hyperbolic triangle .",
    "the tessellation is called the farey tessellation and the vertices are precisely the points that correspond to rational numbers .",
    "see figure  [ fig : farey ]    , width=480 ]    the farey tessellation is invariant under the semi - group generated by @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",

    "given a fraction , @xmath73 , there is an oriented hyperbolic geodesic @xmath74 connecting @xmath72 to @xmath73 .",
    "we assume @xmath74 is oriented so that moving from @xmath72 to a positive rational is the positive direction .",
    "this geodesic @xmath74 will intersect some number of triangles .",
    "the _ farey level _ or the _ level _ of @xmath6 , denoted by @xmath75 , is the number of triangles traversed by @xmath74    note that our definition implies @xmath76 .",

    "this edge will connect two vertices and @xmath74 will exit the triangle along an edge connecting one of these two vertices and the third vertex of the triangle , the _ new _ vertex . since @xmath74 is oriented , the edge through which @xmath74 exits a triangle is either a left edge or a right edge depending upon whether the edge @xmath74 cuts is to the right or left of the new vertex .",
    "we determine a _ farey sequence for @xmath73 _",
    "inductively by choosing the new vertex of next triangle in the sequence of triangles traversed by @xmath74 .",
    "the sequence ends at @xmath6 .",
    "given @xmath6 , we can find the smallest rational @xmath26 and the largest rational @xmath27 that are neighbors of @xmath6 .",
    "these neighbors have the property that they are the only neighbors with lower farey level .",
    "that is , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and if @xmath80 is any other neighbor @xmath81 .",
    "we call the smallest and the largest neighbors of the rational @xmath6 the _ distinguished neighbors _ or the _ parents _ of @xmath6",
    ".    note that we can tell whether a distinguished neighbor @xmath27 is smaller or larger than @xmath6 by the sign of @xmath82 .",
    "we emphasize that we have two different and independent orderings of the rational numbers : the ordering as rational numbers and the partial ordering by level .",
    "our proofs will often use induction on the level of the rational numbers involved as well as the rational order relations among parents and grandparents .",
    "it follows from remark [ remark : nbs ] that if @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the parents of @xmath6 , then any other neighbor of @xmath6 is of the form @xmath83 or @xmath84 for some positive integer @xmath85 .",
    "the neighbors of @xmath86 are precisely the set of integers .",
    "finally we note that we can describe the farey sequence of @xmath6 by listing the number of successive left or right edges of the triangles that @xmath74 crosses where a left edge means that there is one vertex of the triangle on the left of @xmath74 and two on the right , and a right edge means there is only one vertex of @xmath74 on the right",
    ". this will be a sequence of integers , the _ left - right sequence _ @xmath87 where the integers @xmath88 are all positive and @xmath89 is positive or zero .",
    "the sign in front of the sequence is positive or negative depending on the orientation of @xmath74 .",
    "farey sequences are related to continued fraction expansions of positive fractions ; they can also be related to expansions of negative fractions .",
    "we review the connection in part to fix our notation precisely .",
    "we do not use the classical notation of @xcite for negative fractions , but instead use the notation of @xcite which is standardly used by mathematicians working in kleinian groups and three manifolds .",
    "this notation reflects the symmetry about the imaginary axis in the farey tessellation which plays a role in our applications .",
    "this symmetry is built in to the semi group action on the tessellation .    for , for @xmath90 write @xmath17\\ ] ] where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",

    "the approximating fractions , @xmath103 , are also known as the _ approximants_.",
    "they can be computed recursively from the continued fraction for @xmath6 as follows : @xmath104 @xmath105 one can calculate from these recursion formulas that the approximants are alternately to the right and left of @xmath6 .    the farey level can be expressed in terms of the continued fraction @xmath106 $ ] by the formula @xmath107 the distinguished neighbors or parents of @xmath6 have continued fractions @xmath108 \\mbox {   and    } [ a_0 ; a_1 , \\ldots , a_{k-1},a_k-1].\\ ] ]    the farey sequence contains the approximating fractions as a subsequence .",
    "the points of the farey sequence between @xmath109 and @xmath110 have continued fraction expansions @xmath111 , [ a_0;a_1 , \\ldots , a_{j } + 2 ] , \\ldots ,   [ a_0;a_1 , \\ldots a_{j } + a_{j+1}-1].\\ ] ] they are all on the same side of @xmath6 .",
    "we extend the continued fraction notion to negative fractions by defining the continued fraction of @xmath112 to be the negative of that for @xmath113 .",
    "that is , by setting    @xmath114 = [ -a_0;-a_1 \\ldots , -a_k ]   \\mbox { where   }    @xmath115 .",

    "we note that for any pair of neighbors , unless one of them is @xmath69 or @xmath59 , they both have the same sign and thus have equal @xmath120 entries .",
    "since we almost always work with neighbors the difference between our notation and the classical one does not play a role .",
    "in addition to the free group on two generators , @xmath121 , we also consider a non - elementary representation of @xmath2 into @xmath13 where @xmath122 with @xmath123 and @xmath124 . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that if the representation were discrete and free , then up to taking inverses as necessary , any pair of primitive words could be obtained from @xmath125 by applying a sequence of nielsen transformations to the generators .",
    "this sequence is described by an ordered set of integers , @xmath126 $ ] and is used in computing the computational complexity of the algorithm @xcite .",

    "our aim is to lift these results for the generators of the representation groups to pairs of primitives in the free group . to do this we review the algorithm and other prior results . in the free group @xmath2",
    "there is no concept equivalent to a geometric orientation .",
    "therefore in lifting statements from @xmath13 to @xmath2 we need to carefully analyze the role of geometric orientation in the algorithm .",
    "the group @xmath13 consists of isometries in the hyperbolic metric on the upper half plane @xmath129 .",
    "it is conjugate in @xmath130 to the group of isometries of the unit disk @xmath131 with its hyperbolic metric . by abuse of notation , we identify these groups and use whichever model is easier at the time .",
    "all of the results below are independent of the model we use .",
    "an isometry is called _ hyperbolic _ if it has two fixed points on the boundary of the half - plane or the disk , and leaves the hyperbolic geodesic joining them invariant .",
    "this geodesic is called the axis of the element .",
    "one of the fixed points is attracting and the other is repelling .",
    "this gives a natural orientation to the axis since points are moved along the axis toward the attracting fixed point .",
    "this natural orientation does not exist in the free group .",
    "the result that we will apply from @xmath13 uses the orientation of an axis of an element to define the notion of a coherently oriented pair of elements or axes . in what follows we need to lift this concept to the free group .",
