    "the processes that occur are ionization , bremsstrahlung , cherenkov radiation , and , in case of inhomogeneous media , transition radiation ( tr ) .",
    "the latter process had been predicted by ginzburg and frank @xcite in 1946 .",
    "it was first observed in the optical domain by goldsmith and jelley @xcite in 1959 and further studied experimentally with electron beams of tens of kev @xcite .",
    "the relevance of this phenomenon for particle identification went unnoted until it was realized that , for highly - relativistic charged particles ( @xmath0 ) , the spectrum of the emitted radiation extends into the x - ray domain @xcite . while the emission probability for such an x - ray photon is small , its conversion leads to a large energy deposit compared to the average energy deposit via ionization .",
    "this led to the application of tr for particle identification at high momenta @xcite .    since then many studies have been pursued , both at the level of the basic understanding of tr production @xcite as well as with regard to the applications in particle detection and identification @xcite .",

    "the subject of transition radiation and how it can be applied to particle identification has already been comprehensively reviewed in ref .",
    "an excellent concise review is given in @xcite .",
    "therefore , we restrict ourselves to a general description of the phenomenon and how trd is employed in particle identification detectors .",

    "typical values for plasma frequencies are @xmath16=20.6 ev , @xmath17=0.7 ev .",
    "since the emission angle @xmath18 of the tr is small ( @xmath19 ) one usually integrates over the solid angle to obtain the differential energy spectrum : ( ) _ interface= ( -2 )    a single foil has two interfaces to the surrounding medium at which the index of refraction changes .",

    "the tr produced by a multi - foil radiator can be characterized by the following qualitative features :    * one can define the so - called `` formation zone '' @xmath22 z_i=. this can be interpreted as the distance beyond which the electromagnetic field of the charged particle has readjusted and the emitted photon is separated from the field of the parent particle . the formation zone depends on the charged particle s @xmath3 , on the tr photon energy and is of the order of a few tens of microns for the foil and a few hundreds of microns for air @xcite .",

    "the dependence of tr on @xmath3 , it is evident that there is a wide momentum range ( 1100 gev / c ) where electrons ( resp .",

    "<S> we review the basic features of transition radiation and how they are used for the design of modern transition radiation detectors ( trd ) . the discussion will include the various realizations of radiators as well as a discussion of the detection media and aspects of detector construction . with regard to particle identification </S>",
    "<S> we assess the different methods for efficient discrimination of different particles and outline the methods for the quantification of this property . since a number of comprehensive reviews already exist , we predominantly focus on the detectors currently operated at the lhc . to a lesser extent </S>",
    "<S> we also cover some other trds , which are planned or are currently being operated in balloon or space - borne astro - particle physics experiments . </S>"
