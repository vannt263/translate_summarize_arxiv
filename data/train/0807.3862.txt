    "if @xmath57 exceeds @xmath56 , the configuration is doubled and the weight of each identical copy is taken as half the original weight . for a value of the weight lying between the thresholds ,",

    "for simple random walks , however , the picture is different : they can not be trapped in  dead ends \" .",
