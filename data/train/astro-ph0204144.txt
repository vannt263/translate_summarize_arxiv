    "intensity fluctuations of pulsars radiation are caused by scattering of radio waves by electron density inhomogeneities in the interstellar medium .",
    "these fluctuations are a signature of turbulent , non - equilibrium motion in the ism , and as the phenomenon of turbulence itself , they have withstood full theoretical understanding for decades , see e.g. reviews by  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "observationally , the presence of electron density fluctuations leads , among other effects , to temporal and angular broadening of the pulsar image .",
    "these two effects are naturally related  due to fluctuations of the refraction index , different rays from a pulsar travel along paths of different shapes and the stronger the deviation of the path from the straight line , the broader the pulsar image and the larger the time broadening of the arriving signal . denoting the angular width of the image as  @xmath7 , and using simple geometrical consideration , one estimates the arrival time broadening as  @xmath8 , where  @xmath9 is the distance to the pulsar , and @xmath10 is the speed of light , see more detailed discussion in  @xcite .    a ray propagating through the interstellar medium encounters many randomly distributed small  prisms \" on its way , that make the scattering angle wander randomly .",
    "at each scattering event , the angle deflection is proportional to  @xmath11 [ see below ] , where @xmath12 is the wavelength of the scattered radiation .",
    "taking into account that the scattering angle is small and exhibits the standard gaussian random walk , we estimate  @xmath13 , and the time delay scales as  @xmath14 , where @xmath9 plays the role of time in this random walk .",
    "the distance to the pulsar is proportional to the dispersion measure , @xmath4 , and therefore this relation can be checked experimentally .",
    "as has been consistently noted for more than 30 years , observed scaling of scintillations of distant pulsars , @xmath15 , is far from this simple theoretical prediction , instead , it is well described by  @xmath16 , see e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "sutton proposed that scaling for longer lines of sight arose from dramatically increased probability of intersection with strongly scattering hii regions . in this sense , he proposed that rare , large events dominated the line - of - sight averages .",
    "the problem of scintillations was addressed by many authors who developed thorough analytical models , see the discussion in  @xcite .",
    "these models account for both smooth and non - smooth density fluctuations , the latter can arise from turbulent cascades .",
    "the main object of the theories is the so - called projected correlator of density fluctuations .",
    "denote as  @xmath17 the electron density , and  @xmath18 its projection perpendicular to the distance  @xmath9 . here",
    "@xmath19 is a two dimensional vector in the plane perpendicular to the line of sight , and @xmath20 is a coordinate along the line of sight , i.e. @xmath21 . note that these theories all assume that the distribution of projected density fluctuations is gaussian .",
    "the density and projected density correlators are related as : @xmath22 where both fields inside the brackets are taken at the same time .",
    "due to space homogeneity , these correlators depend only on the difference of the coordinates , e.g. , @xmath23 . assuming that the density fluctuations have finite correlation length  @xmath24 , i.e. the @xmath25 function decays fast for  @xmath26 , we obtain @xmath27 it is easy to show that if in the inertial range of turbulent fluctuations , @xmath28 , the @xmath25 function behaves as  @xmath29 $ ] , then the projected function",
    "is expanded as  @xmath30 $ ] . as an estimate",
    ", one has  @xmath31 , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are of the order  1 .",
    "the analytical case corresponds to  @xmath34 , and in this case @xmath35 . in a general case ,",
    "the density field should not be analytic , and  @xmath36 .",
    "for example , kolmogorov turbulence would imply  @xmath37 .",
    "such different possibilities have been exhaustively analyzed in the literature , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "rigorous consideration shows that in the non - analytic case , the scaling of the broadening time changes . for  @xmath38 ,",
    "one obtains   @xmath39 while for a more exotic case ,  @xmath40 , one gets @xmath41 in section [ ray - tracing ] we present a simple derivation of these results . since most observational data indicate that  @xmath12-scaling is close to  @xmath0 , neither possibility provides enough freedom for changing the @xmath9-scaling from @xmath42 to  @xmath43 .    in the present paper",
    "we propose a new model , that fully exploits the turbulent origin of the density fluctuations .",
    "we assume that the statistics of the density fluctuations is not gaussian , but highly intermittent , and that the probability density function ( pdf ) of density differences has power - law decay , @xmath44 . if this power - law distribution does not have a second moment ( @xmath45 ) , the gaussian random walk approach does not work .",
    "instead , we suggest to use the theory of lvy distributions , see  @xcite . physically , the possibility of power - law density distribution seems rather natural for strong turbulent fluctuations .",
    "indeed , the ism turbulence can be near - sonic , i.e. velocity and density fields can develop shock discontinuities . from the theory of shock turbulence ( burgers turbulence )",
    "one knows that shocks or large negative velocity gradients have a power - law distribution ,  @xcite .",
    "jump conditions on a shock then show that the velocity and density discontinuities are proportional to each other , therefore density jumps may also have power - law distribution . taking the lvy distribution of the density fluctuations as a working conjecture ,",
    "we demonstrate that the scaling of the broadening time with respect to  @xmath9 is sensitive to the exponent of the distribution , @xmath46 , and the scaling  @xmath47 is reproduced for  @xmath48 .    in the next section we review the ray - tracing model of pulse propagation , considered before by  @xcite . in particular , we re - derive the results cited above for the gaussian density fluctuations in a general , non - analytic case . in section  [ levy ]",
    "we apply the model to the non - gaussian , lvy distributed density fluctuations .",
    "we then numerically calculate the distribution of pulse - arrival times in the case of a smooth density field , and demonstrate that if  @xmath49 , the width of this distribution changes with the distance to the pulsar as  @xmath50 , in agreement with our scaling arguments .",
    "conclusions and future research are outlined in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "this method is applicable in the limit of geometrical optics , i.e. when the wave length is much smaller than the characteristic size of density inhomogeneities  @xcite .",
    "this rather effective method was applied to the problem of scintillations by  @xcite ; we present it here in the form that allows us to apply it in the next section to lvy walks . in the limit",
    "considered , signal propagation can be characterized by rays , @xmath51 , along which wave packets travel similar to particles obeying the following system of hamilton equations : @xmath52 in this representation , @xmath53 plays the role of hamiltonian , @xmath54 , where  @xmath55 is the electron plasma frequency and @xmath56 is a wave vector .",
    "differentiating the first equation in  ( [ rays ] ) with respect to  @xmath57 and using the second equation one obtains : @xmath58 where  @xmath59 is the classical radius of electron .",
    "taking into account that the ray propagates at small angles to the line of sight , chosen as the @xmath20-axis , we are interested in ray displacement in the perpendicular , @xmath60 direction , and instead of time we will use @xmath20 variable ,  @xmath61 . consider now two rays , separated by a vector  @xmath62 in the direction perpendicular to the @xmath20-axis . as follows from  ( [ ray - eq ] ) , this vector obeys the following equation @xmath63 where  @xmath64 , and  @xmath65 is an auhiliary variable having the meaning of velocity of beam spreading in the @xmath66 direction , clearly  @xmath67 .",
    "let us now assume that the electron density is a gaussian random function with the correlation length  @xmath24 .",
    "then , @xmath68 is a gaussian random walk , whose elementary time step has the length  @xmath24 .",
    "since we are interested in very large propagation distances , @xmath69 , and the scattering angles are very small , one can effectively assume that the random density is short - time correlated , i.e. , the characteristic `` @xmath20-time '' of change of vectors  @xmath70 and @xmath71 is much larger than  @xmath24 .",
    "the diffusion coefficient for this random walk is @xmath72 and the diffusion is described by @xmath73 .",
    "we however observe that the diffusion coefficient depends of the distance  @xmath74 , and its behavior differs qualitatively for @xmath75 and @xmath40 . in the first case ,",
    "@xmath75 , diffusion is larger for smaller distances , therefore two rays are effectively attracting each other in the course of propagation .",
    "this means that at some point the geometrical ray picture will break down , and one needs to consider the effects of interference ( interaction ) of different rays .",
    "this happens when the beam is compressed to the size limited by the uncertainty condition in the perpendicular direction , @xmath76 . upon substituting @xmath77 , and using the expression for the diffusion coefficient  ( [ d ] ) ,",
    "we can obtain the minimal size of contraction , and , equivalently , the diffraction angle corresponding to the aperture of this size .",
    "assuming that the contraction happens at about half the distance between the pulsar and the earth , @xmath78 , we find : @xmath79^{1/(\\alpha+1 ) } , \\quad \\alpha<1 .",
    "\\label{theta1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] recalling now that  @xmath80 , we recover the result  ( [ alpha<1 ] ) . in the second case , @xmath40 , the rays effectively repel , so geometrical optics does not break down . in this case",
    "this equation gives @xmath82^{1/(3-\\alpha ) } , \\quad 1\\leq \\alpha <3 , \\label{theta2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which agrees with the result  ( [ alpha>1 ] ) .",
    "both expressions give the same result for the analytic case , @xmath34 .",
    "the above standard results have been obtained by many authors and by a variety of different methods , see e.g. ,  @xcite . as we mentioned in the introduction , neither one of the expressions  ( [ theta1 ] ) or  ( [ theta2 ] ) allows us to recover the observed scaling @xmath83 . in the next section we address the problem , assuming that the density - difference distribution has a slowly decaying power - law tail , such that the second moment of the distribution does not exist . in this case the diffusion approximation does not hold , and one needs to work directly with eq .",
    "( [ rays2 ] ) to establish the scaling of the probability of pulse arrival times .",
    "in previous section we implicitly used the central limit theorem , which states that the sum of many independent random variables has gaussian distribution if second moments of these variables exist .",
    "more precisely , a convolution of many distribution functions that have second moments , converges to an appropriately rescaled gaussian distribution .",
    "therefore , the convolution of two gaussian functions is a gaussian function again .",
    "one can generalize this question for distribution functions without finite second moments : if their convolution converges , what is going to be the limit ?",
    "the answer is the so - called lvy distribution  @xcite .",
    "as is the gaussian distribution , the lvy distribution is stable : convolution of this distribution with itself gives the same distribution after proper rescaling . in other words , if two independent random variables are drawn from a lvy distribution , their sum has the same distribution , appropriately rescaled .",
    "analogously to a gaussian random walk , a sum of independent , lvy distributed random variables is called a lvy walk or lvy flight .",
    "the latter name reflects the highly intermittent behavior of a typical lvy trajectory : it has sudden large jumps or `` flights , '' see fig .",
    "[ flights ] .",
    "lvy flights are common in completely different random systems and often replace diffusion in turbulent systems . for example",
    ", a particle exhibiting a brownian random motion in an equilibrium fluid , exhibits a lvy walk in a turbulent fluid . for a variety of further illustrations",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "if a random variable  @xmath84 has a lvy probability density ,  @xmath85 , then the fourier transform of this distribution ( the characteristic function ) has the form : @xmath86 where  @xmath87 , and @xmath88 is some positive constant .",
    "for @xmath89 we recover a gaussian distribution .",
    "this formula can be taken as the definition of a symmetric lvy walk .",
    "one can verify that  @xmath90 as  @xmath91 .",
    "of course , a distribution of a physical quantity usually has a second moment .",
    "this does not contradict our case , since the far tails of the pdf , which are not described by the lvy formula , make the dominant contribution to the second moment .",
    "however , if we are interested in effects caused by small fluctuations , @xmath92 , it is the central part of the pdf that is important .",
    "the characteristic function of a convolution of @xmath93 lvy distributions is just a product of @xmath93 characteristic functions  ( [ phi ] ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the sum of  @xmath93 lvy distributed random variables has the distribution @xmath94 this is the demonstration of the convolution _",
    "stability _ of the lvy distribution .",
    "formula  ( [ p ] ) teaches us that the displacement  @xmath84 of the lvy random walk scales with the number of steps as  @xmath95 . in the gaussian case ,",
    "@xmath89 , we recover the well known diffusion result .",
    "we now would like to apply this result to our scintillation problem .",
    "assume _ that the dimensionless density difference  @xmath96 has a lvy distribution with parameter  @xmath46 .",
    "we then obtain from  ( [ rays ] ) , @xmath97 , and [ compare this result to  ( [ d ] ) ! ] : @xmath98 in this formula , @xmath99 describes the scaling of the density fluctuations with distance , while @xmath46 is the exponent of the power - law decay of the density - difference probability distribution function . the scaling in eq .",
    "( [ levy - diffusion ] ) is understood not in the sense of averaging ( the moments of @xmath7 of the order higher than @xmath46 do not satisfy this scaling ) , but in the sense of scaling of the central part of the distribution  @xmath100 .",
    "we now proceed exactly as we did in the derivation of formulae ( [ theta1 ] ) and ( [ theta2 ] ) , and obtain for  @xmath75 : @xmath101^{1/(\\alpha+1 ) } ,    \\label{levy1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and for  @xmath102 : @xmath103^{1/(3-\\alpha)}. \\label{levy2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the smooth ( analytic ) case , @xmath34 , the scaling of the time broadening is @xmath104 we see that this scaling is sensitive to the exponent of the power distribution of the density fluctuations . this result was obtained by rather general arguments , and describes the scaling of the arrival time distribution , rather than the moments of this distribution .",
    "observations measure precisely the time width of the arriving signal , not its moments , i.e. they infer exactly the quantity corresponding to scaling  ( [ levy - smooth ] ) .    in the rest of this section",
    "we would like to verify the scaling  ( [ levy - smooth ] ) , by numerical simulation of eq .",
    "( [ rays2 ] ) .",
    "our simulations also provide the time - shape of the arriving signal .",
    "let us assume that the distance to the pulsar , @xmath9 , is much larger than the scale of an elementary scatter , @xmath24 , i.e. , @xmath105 , where @xmath93  is the number of scattering events . at each scattering event ,",
    "the angle of the ray changes by  @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is a lvy - distributed random variable .",
    "[ we denote @xmath5 and @xmath107 the characteristic changes of the density field and of the angle of propagation on one scattering segment of length  @xmath24 along the line of sight .",
    "this should not be confused with the changes of these variables between two _ different _ rays in a perpendicular plane  @xmath66 , denoted by @xmath108 s . ]",
    "the time delay ( compared to the straight propagation ) introduced by each scattering segment is  @xmath109 .",
    "we need to find the probability distribution of the total travel time delay : @xmath110 ^ 2 , \\label{tau}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] assuming that each @xmath111 [ where @xmath112 due to ( [ rays2 ] ) ] is distributed identically , independently , and according to the lvy law  ( [ phi ] ) with  @xmath48 .",
    "this random variable can be generated in the following manner , see  @xcite .",
    "choose two positive numbers  @xmath113 .",
    "let @xmath114 with probability  @xmath115 , and @xmath116 with the same probability , where @xmath117 .",
    "this is the so - called weierstrass self - similar random walk , that can be considered as a discrete analog of the lvy walk with @xmath118 .    in fig .",
    "[ pdf ] we plot intensity of the arriving signal ( the number of arriving rays ) as a function of time .",
    "the arrival time was calculated with the aid of  ( [ tau ] ) , where in the distribution of @xmath107 we have chosen @xmath48 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 .",
    "we considered the number of scattering events ( the distance to the pulsar ) to be  @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 . from fig .",
    "[ pdf ] one can see that the widths of the curves ( estimated at the half of their maximum values ) indeed differ by a factor of 2 , as the scaling @xmath83 would predict for these distances .",
    "in conclusion , we suggest a novel explanation for the observed scaling of time broadening of pulsar signals for large distances ( large dispersion measures , @xmath15 ) , @xmath124 .",
    "the central concept is that the density fluctuations in the interstellar medium have a lvy probability distribution function that has power - law decay and does not have a second moment .",
    "the angle of pulse propagation , deviated by these density fluctuations , exhibits not a conventional brownian motion , but rather a lvy flight .",
    "the exponent @xmath46 is the parameter of the probability distribution of density differences , and the pulse broadening time is rather sensitive to it , as is described by our main formulae  ( [ levy1 ] ) and ( [ levy2 ] ) . the scaling @xmath124 is recovered for @xmath48 , i.e. for the  @xmath6 decay of the distribution function of density differences .",
    "this tail of the pdf appears as a result of turbulent density fragmentation , and it would be highly desirable to develop an analytical explanation for it . this is a concrete prediction of our model for the turbulence in the ism , that can in principle be checked numerically .",
