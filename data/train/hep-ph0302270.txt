    "the impressive agreement between the standard electroweak theory ( sm ) and experiment is not sufficient to make it the fundamental theory of nature up to very high energies .",
    "this follows mainly from the instability of its higgs sector under radiative corrections .",
    "the supersymmetry ( susy ) is thus one of the remedies which can cure this hierarchy problem .",
    "however , the minimal supersymmetric model ( mssm ) itself has a hierarchy problem concerning the natural scale of the higgsino mass parameter ( @xmath3 problem ) .",
    "this problem is solvable in various frameworks each of which introducing a certain sm singlets to dynamically generate the @xmath3 parameter .",
    "the @xmath4 models form a viable candidate model to extend the mssm in order to solve the @xmath3 problem @xcite .",
    "the vacua that suppress the @xmath5 mixing have been found in @xcite with further improvements concerning the radiative effects @xcite .",
    "the effects of such extra @xmath6 bosons on precision observables have been analyzed in detail in @xcite . moreover ,",
    "several collider signatures have been analyzed for tree level higgs sector @xcite .",
    "recently there have been a revived interest in the flavor changing neutral current phenomena @xcite in such models @xcite .",
    "given the recent indications for a light @xmath1 boson @xcite , it is necessary to analyze certain rare phenomena within such models in order to test or at least determine the ballpark of model parameters .",
    "one such rare decay is the radiative decay of @xmath2 mesons , @xmath0 which is under intense experimental investigation at the present @xmath2 factories .",
    "the flavor mixing in the quark and lepton sectors will lead to flavor changing ( nondiagonal ) couplings of the heavy @xmath7 . since its topology is similar to the photon and gluon vertex , calculating the branching ratio ( br ) and cp asymmetry @xmath8 of the process @xmath9 can restrict the couplings @xmath10 of the @xmath11 .",
    "although in sm cp asymmetry a@xmath12 is less than 1% , in the extension of the sm , due to cp violating couplings large cp asymmetries are possible @xcite . in particular , large asymmetries arise naturally in models with enhanced chromomagnetic dipole operators .",
    "there is also flavor violating z couplings if there is z-@xmath11 mixing .",
    "this is another motivation to search for flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) effects .",
    "the prediction for the @xmath13 branching ratio is usually obtained by normalizing the result for the corresponding decay rate to that for the semileptonic decay rate , thereby eliminating a strong dependence on the b - quark mass @xcite .",
    "the branching fraction is obtained from the cleo experiment @xcite as    @xmath14    where the photon energy is @xmath15 @xmath16 therefore the branching fraction is between    @xmath17    direct cp violation can lead to a difference between the rates for @xmath18 and @xmath19 giving rise to a non - zero value for the cp asymmetry@xcite    @xmath20    the sm predicts that this asymmetry is very small , less than 1% .",
    "recent theoretical work suggests that non - sm physics may contribute significantly to a cp asymmetry , as large as 10 - 40% .",
    "the signature for @xmath21 is a photon with energy sufficiently high that it is unlikely to come from other b decay processes .    in cleo s",
    "work the photon energy range is taken between 2.1 - 2.7 gev , and in conclusion cp asymmetry @xmath22 in @xmath21 plus @xmath23 lies between the limits @xcite ,    @xmath24    at 90% confidence level .",
    "these limits rule out some extreme non - sm predictions , but are consistent with most , as well as with the sm .    by using the constrained couplings of @xmath7 boson from this process",
    ", we may calculate other processes including @xmath7 boson couplings .",
    "at the w - boson mass scale q = m@xmath25 the flavor changing radiative transition @xmath21 is described by the following operator product expansion@xcite    @xmath26    where @xmath27 are the wilson coefficients , and @xmath28 are the local operators defined by    @xmath29    @xmath30    @xmath31    here @xmath32 is a four - fermion operator and its coefficient satisfies @xmath33 @xmath34 that is , it is a constant independent of the looping particle species .",
    "however , the coefficients of the electric @xmath35 and color @xmath36 dipole operators can receive nonvanishing contributions from physics beyond the sm . in general    @xmath37    where the last term is for the new physics contributions , and the sm contributions @xmath38 are @xcite ;    @xmath39    @xmath40    here    @xmath41    in the langacker - plmacher paper @xcite , we let @xmath42 for simplicity .",
    "then the new physics contribution can be parametrized as    @xmath43    where we have used the fact that gluon and photon diagrams have the same topology as @xmath7 boson which is neutral both electrically and chromoelectrically . here",
    "@xmath44 is a complex number whose expression is @xcite    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the diagonal mass matrix of down quarks ,    @xmath47    @xmath48    @xmath49    @xmath50 are the masses of the neutral gauge boson mass eigenstates , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the coupling constants of the neutral gauge bosons z and z@xmath53 respectively .",
    "the wilson coefficients mentioned so far are at the @xmath54 scale .",
    "however , physically one must recalculate them at the @xmath55 scale- the natural scale of the problem .",
    "therefore , the wilson coefficients above are now reduced to @xmath55 scale via@xcite    @xmath56    where the magic numbers on the right are given by    @xmath57    in obtaining @xmath58 we have made use of the leading order qcd renormalization group running from @xmath54 down to @xmath55 and so the renormalization factor @xmath59 having @xmath58 at hand , it is easy to calculate the branching ratio and cp asymmetry of the decay . branching ratio",
