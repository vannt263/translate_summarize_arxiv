    "<S> we report an experimental realization of entanglement concentration using two polarization - entangled photon pairs produced by pulsed parametric down - conversion . in the meantime </S>",
    "<S> , our setup also provides a proof - in - principle demonstration of a quantum repeater . </S>",
    "<S> the quality of our procedure is verified by observing a violation of bell s inequality by more than 5 standard deviations . </S>",
    "<S> the high experimental accuracy achieved in the experiment implies that the requirement of tolerable error rate in multi - stage realization of quantum repeaters can be fulfilled , hence providing a practical toolbox for quantum communication over large distances .    in recent years </S>",
    "<S> , significant experimental advances have been achieved in the field of quantum communication ( qc ) . in particular , entangled photon pairs </S>",
    "<S> have been used to experimentally demonstrate a number of qc schemes such as dense coding @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite and quantum cryptography @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> though the above schemes are achievable for moderate distances ( up to a few tens of kilometers in quantum cryptography ) , serious problems occur in bringing qc to technologically useful scales . </S>",
    "<S> one of the problems is the photon losses in the transmission channel . in quantum cryptography </S>",
    "<S> , the photon losses by themselves only reduce the bit rate ( exponentially with distance ) . with perfect detectors the distance </S>",
    "<S> would not be limited , one can solve this problem by sending more photons . </S>",
    "<S> however , due to the dark counts , whenever a photon is lost there is a chance that a dark count produces an error . </S>",
    "<S> hence , when the probability of a dark count becomes comparable to the probability that a photon is correctly detected , the signal - to - noise ratio tends to 0 . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , as shown in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the use of entangled photons and of entanglement swapping @xcite could offer ways to extend the achievable distances .    </S>",
    "<S> another problem is caused by the noisy quantum channel . </S>",
    "<S> the decoherence degrades the quality of entanglement between two particles more and more the further they propagate . </S>",
    "<S> however , all the above protocols require that two distant parties , usually called alice and bob , share highly entangled photon pairs </S>",
    "<S> . the decoherence can be overcome by exploiting entanglement purification @xcite - a way to extract a subset of highly entangled states from a large set of less entangled states using local operations and classical communication . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , quantum repeaters @xcite , a combination of entanglement swapping and entanglement purification , hold the promise to solve the problems of the photon losses and of the decoherence in long - distance qc .    </S>",
    "<S> though entanglement swapping has been experimentally demonstrated with high accuracy @xcite , the implementation of quantum repeaters remains to be an experimental challenge due to the difficulty to achieve entanglement concentration . </S>",
    "<S> various purification schemes have been proposed for pure or mixed entangled states . </S>",
    "<S> they mainly include three classes . </S>",
    "<S> first , the so - called procrustean method @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it requires that the photon pairs are all in a pure non - maximally entangled state , say , @xmath0 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 and @xmath2 are two _ known _ coefficients that satisfy @xmath3 , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote horizontal and vertical polarizations of the photons . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the scheme only involves local filtering operations on single pairs . </S>",
    "<S> second , the so - called schmidt decomposition scheme @xcite , in which the photon pairs are all in a pure but _ unknown _ non - maximally entangled state @xmath6 . in practice </S>",
    "<S> , this scheme is difficult to implement , since it requires simultaneous collective measurements on many photons . to distinguish the second case from the others , in what follows we refer to it as entanglement concentration . </S>",
    "<S> third , the general purification method that works for arbitrary mixed states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the implementation of the general scheme is more difficult as it requires controlled - not ( cnot ) operations between different photons .    </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that , though only the general scheme can be used to purify arbitrary mixed states , both local filtering and entanglement concentration are of interest in their own rights . </S>",
    "<S> this is because , on the one hand , both methods provide a way to generate maximally entangled states , which is different from the general scheme where only highly entangled states are generated . on the other hand , with the help of local filtering </S>",
    "<S> any inseparable states can be purified @xcite , while the general scheme alone only works for the cases where the entanglement fidelity @xmath7 is larger than 1/2 @xcite .    up to now , </S>",
    "<S> except for the procrustean method has been demonstrated very recently @xcite , there is no experimental implementation of the other schemes due to the difficulty to control many photons . to avoid the difficulties caused by collective measurements and cnot operations , </S>",
    "<S> several practical schemes have been proposed for entanglement concentration @xcite and entanglement purification @xcite , where only linear optical elements are required . in the present experiment , following the scheme as suggested in ref.@xcite , we report the first experimental demonstration of entanglement concentration . meanwhile , using local filtering @xcite and entanglement swapping @xcite we are also able to report the first experimental verification of a quantum repeater .    </S>",
    "<S> we first explain the entanglement concentration scheme ( shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1a ) . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that two parties , alice and bob , would like to share photon pairs in the maximally entangled state @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> further suppose that , due to the imperfect quantum channel , what they share are two photon pairs @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the following unknown states :    @xmath11    where alice holds photons 1 and 3 , and bob holds photons 2 and 4 . before concentration </S>",
    "<S> , the polarization of photon 4 is rotated by @xmath12 using one half - wave plate ( r@xmath13 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1a ) . </S>",
    "<S> after passing through the half - wave plate , the state of photons 3 and 4 becomes @xmath14    then bob superposes photons 2 and 4 onto a polarization beam splitter ( pbs in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1a ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the pbs transmits horizontal and reflects vertical polarization , a coincidence detection between the two outputs @xmath15 and @xmath16 implies that either both photons 2 and 4 are horizontally polarized or both vertically polarized . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , by selecting those events where there is one and only one photon in the output mode @xmath16 , alice and bob can obtain a conditioned four - photon greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state @xcite @xmath17 with a probability of @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> by further performing a polarization measurement on each of the photons 3 and @xmath16 in the @xmath19 basis , where @xmath20 , alice and bob can then project the photons 1 and @xmath15 onto the maximally entangled state @xcite @xmath21    the scheme above deserves some further comments . comparing with the original concentration scheme by bennett et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the present scheme involves only two entangled photon pairs . </S>",
    "<S> hence , it is reachable using the techniques developed in the recent four - photon experiment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the two pairs are required to have the same coefficients at the same experimental trial , but for different trials the coefficients can be different . in reality , this can well be the case if the sources @xmath22 emit only two entangled pairs at each time and thus only these two pairs experience the same environment . </S>",
    "<S> finally , but more importantly , the same idea can also be used to implement a simplified version of quantum repeaters .    to see how it works , </S>",
    "<S> suppose that there is an intermediate station , charlie , between alice and bob ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1b ) . </S>",
    "<S> further suppose that alice and charlie share the pair ( 1,2 ) and , charlie and bob share the pair ( 3,4 ) . here , the pairs ( 1,2 ) and ( 3,4 ) are in the states as shown in equation ( 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> after the photon 4 passes through the r@xmath13 , charlie superposes the photons 2 and 4 at the pbs . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , by performing a polarization measurement on each of the two outputs @xmath15 and @xmath16 in the @xmath19 basis , alice and bob can thus obtain the maximally entangled state @xmath23 in this protocol , both entanglement concentration and entanglement swapping are accomplished in one step . </S>",
    "<S> of course , if the two entangled pairs have different coefficients , for example , the pair ( 1,2 ) in the state @xmath24 and the pair ( 3,4 ) in the state @xmath25 , then the above protocol is not applicable . in the latter case , </S>",
    "<S> if the coefficients are known in advance , we can first apply local filtering to each of the two pairs , then utilize entanglement swapping to generate maximally entangled state @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the task of a quantum repeater can still be accomplished . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that although the above scheme is only a simplified variant , the scheme itself acquires all the necessary features as a quantum repeater .    a schematic drawing of the experimental setup of entanglement concentration is shown in fig . 2a . in the experiment , we first generate two photon pairs in the maximally entangled state @xmath27 by type ii parametric down - conversion @xcite  from an ultraviolet ( uv ) pulsed laser in a bbo crystal . the uv pulse passing through the crystal </S>",
    "<S> creates the first pair in modes 1 and 2 . </S>",
    "<S> after retroflection , during its second passage through the crystal , the laser pulse creates the second pair in modes 3 and 4 . </S>",
    "<S> the uv pulsed laser with a central wavelength of 394 nm has a pulse duration of 200fs , a repetition rate of 76mhz , and an average power of 450mw . to prepare the states in equation ( 1 ) , we send photons 1 and 3 through the same amount of brewster s windows ( bws ) with vertical axis tilted by @xmath28 . due to the polarization - dependent reflectivity , </S>",
    "<S> the transmitted photons are preferentially horizontally polarized . here , with one piece of bw , the transmission probability for horizontal polarization is @xmath29 , and for vertical one @xmath30 .    </S>",
    "<S> after photon 4 passes through the half wave plate r@xmath13 , photons 2 and 4 are steered to the pbs where the path lengths of the two photons have been adjusted such that they arrive simultaneously . through spectral filtering ( f in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) with a @xmath31 nm for all the four photons , the coherence time of the photons was made to exceed the duration of the uv pulse , thus making the two photons 2 and 4 indistinguishable in time @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , fiber - coupled single - photon detectors have been used to ensure good spatial mode overlap between 2 and 4 . </S>",
    "<S> these arrangements consequently lead to two - photon interference . through the whole experiment , </S>",
    "<S> the registered two - fold coincidence rate is about @xmath32 per second before the brewster s windows and the pbs , which results in an overall four - fold coincidence of 8 per second , almost two orders of magnitude higher compared to the recent four - photon experiment @xcite .    in our experiment , we choose to insert one , two or four pieces of bws into each of the modes 1 and 3 to prepare three different initial states ( denoted by ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in order to demonstrate the protocol works for complex coefficients @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( i.e. for both amplitude and phase errors ) , we also slightly tilt the birefrigent compensators ( not shown in the figure ) in the modes 1 and 3 such that a @xmath33 relative phase is introduced between the @xmath34 and @xmath35 components . </S>",
    "<S> ideally , these initial states should only contain @xmath34 and @xmath35 terms . </S>",
    "<S> however , in reality all the four possible outcomes in the @xmath36 basis have been observed . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , the fractions of the four components are shown in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 3a , 3b and 3c . in all three caess , the signal - to - noise ratio is better than 100:1 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we also list in table 1 the ratios between @xmath34 and @xmath37 .    </S>",
    "<S> if entanglement concentration works , then conditional on a @xmath38 coincidence detection in the modes 3 and @xmath16 , the remaining two photons 1 and @xmath15 would be projected onto the maximally entangled state @xmath39 . to verify this prediction , we first measure the fractions of the photons 1 and @xmath15 in the @xmath36 basis after entanglement concentration . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement results are shown in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 3d , 3e and 3f , respectively , from which we can see the signal - to - noise ratios are larger than 20:1 for all three cases . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the contributions of @xmath40 and @xmath41 terms are negligible . at the same time , in table 1 we also list the ratios between @xmath42 and @xmath35 after concentration . </S>",
    "<S> compared with the initial ratios , one can clearly see the significant improvement in the relative intensity between @xmath43 and @xmath35 .    showing that both @xmath34 and @xmath37 appear with roughly the same probability of @xmath44 is just a necessary but not sufficient condition to verify the state @xmath45 , since the above observation is , in principle , both compliant with @xmath46 and with a statistical mixture of @xmath34 and @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , as a further test we have to demonstrate that the two terms @xmath34 and @xmath35 are indeed in a coherent superposition . to do so , we further perform a polarization analysis in the @xmath19 basis . </S>",
    "<S> transforming @xmath47 to the @xmath19 basis yields an expression containing only @xmath48 and @xmath49 , but no other terms like @xmath50 and @xmath51 . as a test for coherence we can now check the presence or absence of various components . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 we compare the @xmath52 and @xmath51 count rates as a function of the pump delay mirror position conditional on detecting a @xmath48 coincidence in the modes 3 and @xmath16 . at zero delay  </S>",
    "<S> photons @xmath53 and @xmath54 arrive at the pbs simultaneously  </S>",
    "<S> the latter component is suppressed with a visibility of @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the high visibility observed in the @xmath19 basis implies a violation of a suitable bell s inequality for the photons 1 and @xmath15 . according to the inequality of clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> there is a constraint on the value of @xmath22 , a combination of four polarization correlation probabilities  two possible analysis settings for each photon . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath58 , no quantum entanglement is necessary to explain the correlations , that is , some local realistic model can reproduce them . </S>",
    "<S> for the maximally entangled state @xmath59 , the maximum value of @xmath22 is @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the value of @xmath22 is a figure of merit for the quality of the entanglement between the photons 1 and @xmath15 . in the experiment , we also measured the @xmath22 value for all three cases . </S>",
    "<S> the integration time is about @xmath61 seconds for each possible outcomes in the first two cases , and @xmath62 seconds in the third case . </S>",
    "<S> the chsh inequality was violated by more than 5 standard deviations in all cases ; see table 1 . </S>",
    "<S> since the entanglement visibility @xmath63 satisfies the relation @xmath64 , we can calculate the visibility @xmath63 from the observed value @xmath22 and further estimate the fidelity for the photons 1 and @xmath15 to be in the state @xmath59 . as shown in table 1 , </S>",
    "<S> the fidelity obtained is larger than @xmath65 in all cases .    in order to show our experiment </S>",
    "<S> also provides an realization of a quantum repeater , we reassemble the setup as shown in fig . 2b . </S>",
    "<S> we first consider the case where the two photon pairs ( 1,2 ) and ( 3,4 ) are in the same initial state . in this case , as discussed in equation ( 5 ) , conditional on detecting a @xmath66 coincidence in @xmath15 and @xmath16 , the photons 1 and 3 shared by alice and bob will be left in the state @xmath67 . in the first repeater experiment , we choose the initial state ( b ) to verify this prediction . </S>",
    "<S> this is done by measuring the fractions of the photons 1 and 3 in both @xmath36 and @xmath19 bases . while hv and vh components are observed with roughly the same probability of @xmath44 , both hh and vv terms </S>",
    "<S> are negligible . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , an interference visibility of @xmath68 is observed in the @xmath19 basis . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath22 value for the photons 1 and 3 is measured to be @xmath69 , from which the fidelity for the photons 1 and 3 to be in the state @xmath70 is about @xmath71 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now consider the case that the two photon pairs ( 1,2 ) and ( 3,4 ) are in different initial states . in the second repeater experiment </S>",
    "<S> , we first prepare the pair ( 1,2 ) in the state ( a ) and the pair ( 3,4 ) in the state ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> we then perform local filtering to convert the pairs ( 1,2 ) and ( 3,4 ) into the same maximally entangled state @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we utilize entanglement swapping to generate the desired state @xmath72 between alice and bob . again , this is achieved by detecting a @xmath73 coincidence in @xmath15 and @xmath16 . to verify the success of our quantum repeater protocol </S>",
    "<S> , we also measured the @xmath22 value for the photons 1 and 3 , which is @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the fidelity for the photons 1 and 3 to be in the state @xmath70 is about @xmath75 .    </S>",
    "<S> it should be mentioned that in the above repeater experiments both entanglement purification and entanglement swapping play a crucial role in generating maximally entangled states between alice and bob . without applying entanglement concentration or local filtering </S>",
    "<S> , the operation of entanglement swapping alone will only generate a non - maximally entangled state , say , @xmath76 in the first repeater experiment . </S>",
    "<S> such a state acquires an entanglement fidelity even worse than the original pairs . </S>",
    "<S> the necessity of both entanglement concentration ( or local filtering ) and entanglement swapping implies that both experiments present a faithful demonstration of a quantum repeater . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , after taking into account the imperfection of the @xmath27 state preparation in the scond experiment , we can estimate the pbs accuracy to interfere two independent photons from the experimental visibility for entanglement swapping , which is about @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> this clearly surpasses the strict precision requirement of local operations for the multi - stage realization of quantum repeaters @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the techniques developed for our entanglement concentration and quantum repeater experiment provide a practical toolbox for future realization of long - distance quantum communication .    100    c. h. bennett & s. j. wiesner , _ phys . rev . </S>",
