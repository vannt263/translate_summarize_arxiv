    "one of the methods to increase luminosity at pep - ii  @xcite is to reduce a vertical beta function @xmath0 at the interaction point ( ip ) .",
    "the current plan is to reduce @xmath0 from the present value of 12.5  mm to 9  mm this year , and to @xmath55  mm within the next few years .    due to a finite bunch length @xmath6",
    ", particle interactions occur over distance @xmath7 from ip . because of angular divergence @xmath8 , beam size increases with distance @xmath9 from ip according to : @xmath10 . as a result ,",
    "contribution to luminosity is gradually reduced with distance from the beam waist at ip .",
    "this so - called `` hourglass '' effect can be analytically estimated and translated into a luminosity reduction factor due to a finite bunch length  @xcite .",
    "for flat beams with equal beam size and emittance , this factor depends only on one parameter @xmath11 and is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hglass ] .        at present , the bunch length and",
    "@xmath0 at pep - ii are about of the same size . according to fig .",
    "[ fig : hglass ] , this corresponds to 14% of luminosity loss due to the hourglass effect .",
    "if @xmath0 is reduced from the current 12.5  mm to 9  mm and then to 5  mm without changing @xmath6 , luminosity loss would increase to 21% and 35% , respectively .",
    "one can conclude , therefore , that for maximum pep - ii luminosity at lower @xmath0 , bunch length has to be reduced as well .    among other parameters ,",
    "the equilibrium bunch length depends on the total accelerating rf - voltage @xmath12 , momentum compaction factor @xmath13 and bending radius @xmath14 as @xmath15 where @xmath16 denote an average in the machine  @xcite .",
    "the pep - ii upgrade to increase rf - voltage for a smaller bunch length is being implemented .",
    "however , the bunch length is a relatively slow function of @xmath12 , therefore many rf - cavities would be needed for a large reduction of @xmath0 . to help reduce the bunch length ,",
    "a reduction of momentum compaction factor may be considered .",
    "the momentum compaction factor is defined by dispersion function @xmath17 and bending radius @xmath14 according to @xmath18 where @xmath17 depends on @xmath14 and quadrupole focusing .",
    "a change of bending properties or magnet locations is not considered in this paper since it would require a modification of machine geometry . therefore , for a fixed bending , a smaller momentum compaction factor could be achieved by reducing the average dispersion in bends by means of a stronger quadrupole focusing .",
    "such optics modification is discussed below for the pep - ii high energy ring ( her ) with @xmath19  cm .",
    "layout of the her is shown in fig .  [ fig : ring ] .",
    "the lattice consists of six arcs with periodic @xmath1 cells and six straight sections with various matched optics for the interaction region ( ir ) , injection , rf - cavities , and tune and coupling correction .",
    "the her nominal dispersion function is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : disp60 ] , where ip is in the middle at @xmath20  m. modulation of @xmath17 in the four arcs farthest from ir is introduced to increase the her horizontal emittance to 48  nm , while in the two arcs near ir it is caused by special @xmath21 bumps for the ir sextupoles .",
    "because in the four arcs this perturbation is a free betatron motion around the periodic @xmath17 , it does not change the average dispersion @xmath22 and bunch length , but increases @xmath23 for a higher emittance . in the straight sections ,",
    "dispersion is canceled by dispersion suppressors .",
    "the most contribution to momentum compaction factor in her comes from dispersion in the arcs .",
    "a simple way to reduce @xmath22 is to increase phase advance in the periodic arc cells .",
    "the effect of phase advance per cell @xmath24 can be estimated using a thin lens approximation .",
    "this method gives the following well - known equations for the extreme ( @xmath25 ) values of @xmath21 and @xmath17 , and the quadrupole integrated strength @xmath26 in the arc fodo cell : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a cell length .",
    "for an estimate of the average values of @xmath21 and @xmath17 in the arcs , one could use the following approximation : @xmath29        below , a modification of her optics for a lower momentum compaction factor is considered , where phase advance in the four arcs farthest from ir is increased from @xmath1 to @xmath2 per cell .",
    "the other two arcs contain some of the ir sextupoles and skew quadrupoles to compensate the detector solenoid and non - linear chromaticity . in order to maintain the original ir optics and local correction ,",
    "these two arcs were not changed .",
    "since the maximum @xmath21 functions are about the same in @xmath1 and @xmath2 cells , physical aperture acceptance will not be reduced by this modification . as in @xmath1 optics ,",
    "the @xmath2 cells naturally provide @xmath30 transformation between arc sextupoles to help compensate the third order sextupole aberrations . also , the first order chromatic perturbation of @xmath21 function is naturally suppressed in @xmath2 lattice .    according to eqn .",
    "[ eqn : dxav ] , the average dispersion in @xmath2 arc is reduced by a factor of 2 compared to @xmath1 lattice .",
    "consequently , the momentum compaction factor in four @xmath2 and two @xmath1 arcs is reduced by a factor of @xmath31 compared to the @xmath1 value . from eqn .",
    "[ eqn : betpm][eqn : kl ] , disadvantages of @xmath2 cells are a factor of @xmath32 stronger quadrupoles , a factor of @xmath33 larger linear chromaticity per cell and a factor of @xmath34 stronger sextupoles ( @xmath35 ) .    to maintain the original non - dispersive optics in the injection , tuning and rf - cavity sections , quadrupole focusing in dispersion suppressors designed for @xmath1 arcs was appropriately adjusted to match the straight sections to the new @xmath21 functions and reduced dispersion in @xmath2 arcs .",
    "one complication was related to the original design of arc sextupoles , where each of the four arcs has 12 sf and 12 sd sextupoles to correct linear chromaticity . ideally , the same family sextupoles should have identical lattice functions to minimize residual sextupole aberrations .",
    "but in the her , 2 sf and 2 sd sextupoles in each arc are extended into the dispersion suppressors which have different optics compared to the arcs . in the original @xmath1 design , lattice functions at the above 4 sextupoles were made reasonably close to the periodic values in the arcs .",
    "it has been found particularly important to keep this property in the @xmath2 modification as well .",
    "it was verified that a large change of @xmath21 functions at these sextupoles could reduce dynamic aperture to unacceptable level .",
    "this is caused by an increase of the third order sextupole geometric aberrations if they are not sufficiently compensated due to breakdown of optical periodicity and @xmath30 transformation at the 4 sextupoles .",
    "the resultant dispersion in her with four @xmath2 arcs is shown in fig .  [ fig : disp90 ] . in this option , a periodic dispersion without modulation is used in the @xmath2 arcs , while dispersion in the two arcs near ir is not changed .",
    "some of the her global parameters for the original @xmath1 and modified @xmath2 lattice with @xmath19  cm are shown in table  1 , where the total voltage of @xmath36  mv was used .",

    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : param ]    momentum compaction factor is reduced by 30% in the @xmath2 modification , therefore the bunch length is expected to decrease by 16% . the reduced dispersion in @xmath2 arcs results in a smaller horizontal emittance @xmath37 in this option . a modulation of @xmath17 may be introduced to increase the emittance . for the same rf - voltage ,",
    "synchrotron tune @xmath38 is also reduced by 16% since it scales as @xmath39 . if the voltage is increased for a smaller bunch length , @xmath38 could be restored .",
    "naturally , the stronger quadrupole focusing in @xmath2 arcs increases the her betatron tune @xmath40 and linear chromaticity @xmath41 .",
    "quadrupole strength increases by 42% in the @xmath2 arcs , and the sf , sd sextupoles become stronger by a factor of 2.3 and 2.5 , respectively , compared to @xmath1 design .",
    "the large increase in strength may require an upgrade for some of these magnets .",
    "optics and compensation schemes of the interaction region have not been changed in this modification .",
    "the ir sextupoles provide correction of the non - linear chromaticity generated in the final quadrupole doublets near ip .",
    "it has been important to verify that compensation of non - linear chromaticity has not been affected by arc modifications .",
    "indeed , calculation of betatron tune and @xmath42 in the @xmath2 lattice versus relative momentum deviation @xmath43 showed a negligible change of non - linear chromaticity compared to the original optics .",
    "this confirms that the ir chromaticity correction is , indeed , local .",
    "tune shift in the modified her is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tune90 ] for the range of @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the _ rms _ relative energy spread in the beam , and linear chromaticity is set to zero .     in her with reduced @xmath13.,width=309 ]",
    "finally , tracking simulations have been performed to verify dynamic aperture for the her with @xmath2 arcs and @xmath4  cm .",
    "simulations have been done using lego code  @xcite for 10 different combinations of random field and alignment errors , and @xmath46 synchrotron oscillations .",
    "compensation of beam orbit , linear chromaticity , coupling and tune were simulated in lego prior to tracking .",
    "the resultant dynamic aperture at the injection point is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : aper90 ] , where the 10 dash lines represent different error settings .",
    "the area inside a dash line corresponds to a particle stable motion .",
    "this dynamic aperture exceeds @xmath47 depicted by a solid line , where @xmath48 is the _ rms _ size of a fully coupled beam at injection with @xmath49  nm and @xmath50 .",
    "this dynamic aperture should be sufficient for beam operation .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that @xmath2 optics in her for a lower momentum compaction factor may be considered as an option for a shorter bunch length .",
    "it has been shown that momentum compaction factor in her can be reduced by 30% by increasing phase advance per cell from @xmath1 to @xmath2 in four arcs .",
    "the resultant dynamic aperture exceeds @xmath47 and is considered adequate .",
