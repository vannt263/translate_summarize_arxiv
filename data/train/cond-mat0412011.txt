    "kinetic theory of dilute gases has played crucial roles in the history of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics . the theoretical treatment of linear transport problems is well established including the derivation of navier - stokes equation and the relation between boltzmann equation and the linear - response theory through a number of studies of boltzmann equation@xcite .",
    "the transport problems under the nonlinear - nonequilibrium circumstance , however , is still controversial .",
    "in fact , we know burnett s classical work in which he obtained an approximate hydrodynamic equation at the second order nonequilibrium condition@xcite , but we realize that hydrodynamic equation he obtained is unstable for perturbations@xcite .",
    "therefore , one may suggest that the validity of chpaman - enskog method is so limited that we should use grad expansion@xcite to discuss the higher order perturbations such as burnett order and super - burnett order@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , when we obtain the steady solution of burnett equation , the stability of the steady inhomogeneous solution may be different from that of dynamical burnett equation for homogeneous perturbation .",
    "therefore we can not judge whether the calculation at burnett order based on chapman - enskog method is useless even when burnett s hydrodynamic equation is unstable .",
    "unfortunately , these difficulties might be regarded as unimportant , because the solution at burnett order is practically useless except for few cases such as the analysis of shock waves .    in these days , however , the solution of boltzmann equation at burnett order has attracted much interest among researchers who try to extend the linear nonequilibrium statistical mechanics to nonlinear nonequilibrium statistical mechanics@xcite .",
    "in fact , since all of attempts are formulated to match them with the linear response theory , their consistency with nonlinear theory like burnett solution should be important .",
    "recently , kim and hayakawa@xcite have extended burnett s classical work on boltzmann equation and obtained the explicit steady solution of boltzmann equation under the steady heat conduction at second ( burnett ) order . the accuracy and numerical stability of this solution",
    "is confirmed by fushiki@xcite from his molecular - dynamics simulation .",
    "this stable behavior does not contradict with blown - up tendency of burnett equation for perturbation of short wavelength or high frequency , because the simulation does not involve any perturbation with short wavelength or high frequency .",
    "their solution is useful@xcite to examine the validity of nonequilibrium theories such as information theory@xcite and the steady - state thermodynamics ( sst)@xcite based on thermodynamic arguments .",
    "they also succeed to apply the solution to calculate the rate of chemical reaction under the nonequilibrium circumstance in which the linear nonequilibrium effects are canceled from the consideration of symmetries@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to ( i ) summarize the achievement of kim and hayakawa , ( ii ) to discuss the stability of the steady solution at burnett order , and ( iii ) to introduce the result of the molecular - dynamics ( md ) simulation for nonequilibrium knudsen effect to examine sst .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the next section",
    ", we briefly summarize the outline of the solution obtained by kim and hayakawa@xcite . in section iii",
    ", we will discuss the stability of the solution . in section iv",
    ", we will discuss knudsen effect under a nonequilibrium condition based on md simulation .",
    "in this section , we briefly summarize the solution of steady boltzmann equation under the heat conduction obtained by kim and hayakawa@xcite .",
    "suppose a system of dilute gas in a steady state whose velocity distribution function is @xmath0 .",
    "the steady state boltzmann equation is written as @xmath1 where the collision integral @xmath2 for hard core molecules is expressed as @xmath3 here the velocity distribution @xmath4 and @xmath5 change to @xmath6 and @xmath7 by a binary collision .",
    "the relative velocity of the two molecules before and after the interaction has the same magnitude @xmath8 .",
    "the relative position of the two molecules is represented by the impact parameter @xmath9 and @xmath10 which represents the angle of the plane to which @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the impact parameter @xmath9 is identical to explicitly determined by specifying the kind of molecules .",
    "the velocity distribution function @xmath4 can be expanded as : @xmath13 where the small parameter of the perturbation is knudsen number , i.e. mean free path of the molecules is much less than the characteristic length of the change of macroscopic variables . @xmath14 in eq.([be3 ] ) is the local maxwellian distribution function written as @xmath15,\\label{be3.5}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is mass of the molecules . @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the density and the temperature at position @xmath19 , respectively . substituting eq.([be3 ] ) into the steady state boltzmann equation ( [ be1 ] ) , we arrive at the following set of equations : @xmath20\\phi^{(1)}_{\\mathrm{1}}={\\bf v}_{\\mathrm{1}}\\cdot\\nabla f^{(0)}_{\\mathrm{1 } } , \\label{be4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath21 and @xmath20\\phi^{(2)}_{\\mathrm{1}}={\\bf v}_{\\mathrm{1}}\\cdot\\nabla f^{(1)}_{\\mathrm{1}}-j(f^{(1)}_{\\mathrm{1}}f^{(1)}_{\\mathrm{2}}),\\label{be5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath22 , where the linear integral operator @xmath23 $ ] is defined as@xmath20x_{\\mathrm{1}}\\equiv\\int \\int \\int f^{(0)}_{\\mathrm{1}}f_{\\mathrm{2}}^{(0)}(x_{\\mathrm{1}}^{\\prime}-x_{\\mathrm{1}}+x^{\\prime}_{\\mathrm{2}}-x_{\\mathrm{2}})g b db d\\epsilon d{\\bf v}_{\\mathrm{2}}. \\label{be6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is important to consider the solubility conditions of these integral equations , for the steady state boltzmann equation , which are given by @xmath24 for @xmath21 , where @xmath25 is one of the collision invariants : @xmath26 substituting eq.([be3.5 ] ) into the solubility condition ( [ be7 ] ) , it can be shown that @xmath27 is uniform .",
    "we use this result in our calculation . the solubility condition for @xmath22",
    "is given by @xmath28    to make the solutions of the integral equations ( [ be5 ] ) and ( [ be6 ] ) definite , five further conditions must be specified ; we identify the density : @xmath29 the temperature : @xmath30 and the mean flow : @xmath31 here we assume that no mean flow @xmath32 exists in the system .",
    "skipping the derivation of the solution at burnett order , let us write the explicit form of the steady solution for hard core molecules as under the temperature gradient : @xmath33 , \\label{be46}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 for @xmath37 can be determined as listed in tables.[b0r ] .",
    "note that we have confirmed the convergence of series @xmath38 by changing @xmath39 . here",
    "@xmath40 represents @xmath41component of the heat - flux in the cell on the right hand side in the nonequilibrium steady state which corresponds to the @xmath42 component of the heat flux in eq.([be39 ] ) . in eq.([be46 ] ) , @xmath43 is the gamma function , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is the sonine polynomial defined by @xmath46 this kind of analysis , of course , is possible to two - dimensional dilute hard - core gases .",
    "kim@xcite has already obtained the result to compare his result with md simulation .    in the derivation",
    "the solubility conditions for @xmath22 is important .",
    "thus , eq.([be9 ] ) leads to the condition : @xmath47 where @xmath48 , i.e. the heat flux for @xmath49 can be obtained as @xmath50 with @xmath51 listed in table.[b0r ] .",
    "it must be emphasized that @xmath52 should satisfy @xmath53 from the symmetry consideration of @xmath54 .",
    "thus , the solubility conditions for @xmath55 of the steady state boltzmann equation lead to the fact that the heat flux is constant to the second order . from eqs.([be38 ] ) and ( [ be39 ] ) , we also obtain an important relation between @xmath56 and @xmath57 as @xmath58 from eq.([be39.5 ] ) , the term of @xmath57 can be replaced by the terms of @xmath56 .    amongst several applications of the solution , in this paper , we emphasize that the solution can examine the validity of sst proposed by sasa and tasaki@xcite .",
    "they propose a non - trivial nonequilibrium effect in a simple setup as follows ( fig .",
    "[ sst ] ) .",
    "there are two cells whose size along @xmath42 axis is @xmath59 .",
    "both of the cells are filled with dilute gases and connected to each other by a small hole at @xmath60 whose linear dimension along @xmath42 axis and its diameter are less than the mean free path .",
    "the cell on the left hand side is at equilibrium of temperature @xmath61 , while the cell on the right hand side is in a nonequilibrium steady state under a temperature gradient caused by the right wall at temperature @xmath62 at @xmath63 and the thin mid - wall at temperature @xmath61 .",
    "sasa and tasaki predicted the following results@xcite .",
    "when the system shown in fig.[sst ] is in a steady state , the osmosis @xmath64 @xmath65 always positive , where @xmath66 is the pressure in the equilibrium cell and @xmath67 is the @xmath68-component of the pressure tensor @xmath69 in the nonequilibrium cell which is defined by @xmath70 in addition , there is a relation among @xmath71 , @xmath67 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 as @xmath74 where @xmath71 is the density of the cell in the nonequilibrium steady state around the wall and @xmath72 is the density of the cell at equilibrium .",
    "a nonequilibrium steady state is achieved when the mean mass flux at the hole is zero . neglecting the knudsen layer effect , i.e. the slip effect around the wall@xcite",
    ", we can calculate the balance of mass flux as @xmath75 where @xmath76 represents the components of the velocity which are orthogonal to @xmath77 , i.e. @xmath78 and @xmath79 . from eq.([be48 ] ) , we can obtain the relation between the density of the cell in the nonequilibrium steady state around the hole @xmath71 and that of the cell at equilibrium @xmath72 as @xmath80 , \\label{be50}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to the second order , where @xmath81 in the approximation until 7th order expansion of @xmath38 .",
    "similarly we can calculate pressure tensor @xmath69 as @xmath82,\\label{be51}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the unit tensor @xmath83 and the number tensor @xmath84 and @xmath85 .    from substitution of eqs.([be50 ] ) and ( [ be51 ] ) into eq.([be53 ] ) leads to the relation @xmath86 in sst .",
    "on the other hand , our results conflict with this relation : our results become @xmath87 for hard core molecules .",
    "this is a negative result to sst , though the treatment of the wall in our calculation is too primitive .",
    "we also indicate that our treatment in eq.([be50 ] ) assumes that we can use the local distribution function because of small knudsen number , though , for dilute gases with finite temperature gradient , the place with the mean - free path away from the hole has different temperature from that at the hole because knudsen number should be finite .",
    "in this section , let us discuss the stability of the second order solution in eq.([be46 ] ) . honestly speaking ,",
    "it is difficult to obtain the complete stability analysis of the problem .",
    "therefore , here , we focus on the stability of five hydrodynamic modes which are zero - eigen modes of linearized boltzmann operator and most dangerous ones in the stability",
    ".    we should recall that the steady solution with the temperature field @xmath88 is obtained under the assumption of the zero mean ( hydrodynamic ) flow . with the aid of eq.([q_2 ] ) one of the hydrodynamic equations corresponding to the solution is the steady diffusion equation : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the heat conductivity .",
    "another hydrodynamic equation is nothing but equilibrium condition of hydrostatic pressure : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the density determined from the solution .",
    "when we keep the constraint of the static solubility conditions ( [ be38 ] ) and ( [ q_2 ] ) , there is no room to appear @xmath52 in the hydrodynamic equations . even when the perturbation violates the static solubility condition , the possible second order",
    "heat current is only @xmath93 in the perturbation , where @xmath94 , and @xmath95 is the shear viscosity .",
    "it should be noted that the above expression is from eq.(15.3.6 ) in chapman - cowling@xcite with neglecting the nonlinear terms of the velocity field .",
    "we also note that the perturbed pressure tensor has the form of navier - stokes order , because the velocity field itself is a perturbed quantity .",
    "thus , the linearized hydrodynamics has a similar form as that of navier - stokes equation except for a term of the heat current in eq.([q_2new ] ) .    nevertheless , it is still not easy to discuss the complete stability of hydrodynamic modes around the steady burnett solution .",
    "let us discuss the perturbation of density and temperature @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the temperature after we include the perturbation .",
    "here we keep that the macroscopic velocity does not exist for the sake of simplificity . in this case",
    "it is easy to confirm that the linearized hydrodynamic equations are reduced to @xmath98 and @xmath99 where the heat conductivity is assumed to be @xmath100 with @xmath101 .",
    "this equation apparently shows that the solution of @xmath102 is relaxed to zero for all wavelength , as time goes on .",
    "thus , the steady solution of boltzmann equation at burnett order is stable for the perturbation ( [ hydro - vari ] ) without macroscopic flow .",
    "in this section , we show our preliminary result of two - dimensional molecular - dynamics ( md ) simulation to examine the knudsen effect under the heat conduction .",
    "although we adopt two - dimensional systems , md can check the validity of their implicit assumptions of the calculation by kim and hayakawa@xcite where their calculation neglect the effects of the thermal wall at @xmath60 and use the distribution function at @xmath60 in eq .",
    "( [ int ] ) .",
    "we prepare two situations where @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "number of total particles is 10,000 for both cases . neglecting the non - gaussian correction in velocity distribution function , the mean - free paths @xmath105 for the center regions of four cells are respectively evaluated as @xmath106 and @xmath107 for the case @xmath104 and @xmath108 and @xmath109 for @xmath103 , where @xmath110 and @xmath111 represent the mean - free paths for an equilibrium cell and a nonequilbrium cell , respectively .",
    "figure 2 shows the result of both situations . @xmath112 and",
    "the height @xmath113 .",
    "the linear dimension along x - axis of the hole is 0.40845 @xmath114 and the diameter of the hole is @xmath115 .",
    "this system has the area fraction @xmath116 . the vertical axis in fig.2 plots the pressure divided by the density and temperature of equilibrium cell @xmath117 .",
    "the horizontal axis shows the time of simulation measured by the number of collisions for each particle .",
    "we adopt the diffusive boundary condition for the walls at @xmath60 and @xmath118 , and the periodic boundary condition at @xmath119 .    in fig.2 ,",
    "the suffices 1 and 2 in the figure correspond to the cases of @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "our result is contrast to those of both sst@xcite and the calculation by kim and hayakawa@xcite . here",
    ", the osmosis @xmath64 depends on the gradient of temperature in which @xmath64 becomes positive for @xmath103 and @xmath64 becomes negative for @xmath104 .",
    "this simulation suggests that both sst and the calculation by kim and hayakawa can not be used for knudsen effect in physical situations .",
    "there are two possibilities to have linear dependence of the osmosis @xmath64 on the temperature gradient : ( i ) knudsen s layer effect is important on the thermal wall , and ( ii ) the assumption of small knudsen number is violated . as a result of finiteness of knudsen number which is around 1/50 - 1/100 ,",
    "the temperature at the place deviated from the hole by the mean - free path is significantly different from the temperature at the hole .",
    "we believe that the second possibility plays a dominant role , because the gap of the pressure is enhanced when the nonequilibrium cell has higher temperature , _",
    "i.e. _ larger mean - free path @xmath120 than that for low temperature nonequilibrium cell @xmath106 .",
    "the details of md simulation will be reported elsewhere .",
    "in conclusion , we have explained our recent finding of a new explicit solution of boltzmann equation under the steady heat conduction .",
    "we apply the solution to examine the validity of sst and information theory , and find that both of them are not appropriate as they are .",
    "we also discuss the stability of the steady solution we have obtained , and confirmed stability at least for the case of no systematic flow . through md simulation of knudsen effect under the heat conduction , we have obtained the result that @xmath64 depends on the direction of the temperature gradient .",
    "this indicates that our naive application of the steady solution of boltzmann equation to knudsen effect is not accurate .",
    "this also suggests that the basic assumption of sst can not be valid if the influence of physical wall exists .    0.5 cm acknowledgment : the authors wish to thank m. fushiki for fruitful discussion and for his sending us the unpublished result of his simulation .",
