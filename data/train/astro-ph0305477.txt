    "kh 15d is a unique system in which a pre - main sequence star is periodically occulted by extended , non - luminous matter , presumably part of a circumstellar disk @xcite .",
    "every 48.36 days the star fades over 2 - 3 days by @xmath03.5 mag and remains near minimum light for @xmath020 days .",
    "the eclipse duration has been increasing with time , by @xmath01 - 2 days / yr . @xcite obtained low resolution spectra in and out of eclipse and concluded that the star was a k7 weak - line t tauri star ( wtts ) .",
    "the wtts classification , based on the equivalent width ( ew ) of the h@xmath1 line out of eclipse , is supported by the lack of any ir or uv excess emission and the absence of substantial photometric variability outside of eclipse .",
    "based on its membership in ngc 2264 @xcite , the estimated mass of the k7 star is 0.5 - 1 m@xmath5 and its age is 2 - 4 myr .    in an attempt to learn more about this unique system we obtained high resolution spectra during the eclipse of december 2001 .",
    "we hoped to determine whether kh 15d is a radial velocity variable , whether there was evidence for additional light in the system beyond that of the k7 star , and whether the occultation had any effect on the spectrum . in fact , we found dramatic changes in the line profiles of h@xmath1 and h@xmath3 , as well as weak forbidden emission lines that become much more visible during eclipse .",
    "evidently , the kh 15d system behaves like a  natural coronagraph \" , allowing us to see details of its close circumstellar environment during eclipse .",
    "our evidence suggests that this wtts is actively accreting gas and driving a bipolar outflow , although probably not at the rate of a typical ctts .",
    "this calls into question the common practice of associating wtts characteristics with the absence of an accretion disk .",
    "high resolution echelle spectra of kh 15d were obtained on the nights of ut 2001 nov .",
    "29 , when it was in its bright state just prior to eclipse , on ut 2001 dec .",
    "14 , just past mid - eclipse , and again on ut 2001 dec . 20 during egress ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "these data were collected with the ultraviolet - visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) on the european southern observatory s very large telescope ( vlt ) , at mount paranal , chile .",
    "the wavelength range is @xmath04780 to 6810  .",
    "a 50  gap centered on 5800  is present due to use of the red arm which employs a mosaic of two 4096 x 2048 ccds @xcite . with a 1  slit ,",
    "the spectral resolution is @xmath044,000 .",
    "the spectra presented here were reduced via the uves pipeline .",
    "information regarding the reduction process can be found at http://www.eso.org / instruments / uves/. as a check on this , the spectra were also reduced in the manner described by @xcite .",
    "both procedures make use of a sky subtraction algorithm .",
    "no significant differences were found between the data reduced by these techniques and the uves pipeline reduction is adopted here .",
    "the uves spectra confirm that , out of eclipse , the primary light source in the kh 15d system is a k7 wtts .",
    "the 29 nov .",
    "spectrum was visually compared in detail to 61 cyg b , a typical k7 v , to look for any evidence of a second source of light in the system .",
    "no additional features were found .",
    "this spectrum was also compared to a rotationally broadened , synthetic k7 v template to determine its @xmath6 , which we estimate to be @xmath7 5 km / s .",
    "the ew of the lii 6707 feature is 0.401  @xmath2 0.001 , consistent with the value of 0.47  @xmath2 0.05 measured on a low resolution spectrum by @xcite .",
    "the out - of - eclipse spectrum was cross - correlated against hd 55999 , a standard observed on the same nights , to determine the radial velocity of kh 15d .",
    "this was done with the iraf task fxcor . since the spectra were obtained on two ccds covering different wavelength regions , a cross - correlation was performed on each , avoiding the emission line regions of h@xmath1 , and h@xmath3",
    ". a heliocentric radial velocity of + 9.0 km / s @xmath2 0.2 , was found by this procedure for kh 15d on 29 nov 2001 .",
    "the egress spectrum was cross - correlated against the out - of - eclipse spectrum in the same manner to look for any radial velocity variation between 29 nov . and",
    "a difference in heliocentric radial velocity of 3.3 @xmath2 0.6 km / s was found .",
    "the radial velocity of the star on 20 dec .",
    "was , therefore , + 12.3 km / s @xmath2 0.6 .",
    "whether this detection of radial velocity variation means that the k7 star is a spectroscopic binary remains to be seen .",
    "photospheric line profile variations are expected in a partially eclipsed star and the likely importance of scattered radiation near minimum light further complicates the interpretation . clearly",
    "a more extensive radial velocity study of the system is needed and is underway ( j. johnson & g. marcy , private communication ) .",
    "in figures 2 - 4 , we show the h@xmath1 , h@xmath3 , and [ oi ] 6300 emission - line profiles for kh 15d . each spectrum has been flux calibrated to a relative scale using an r magnitude for the date , as given in table 1 .",
    "the quoted uncertainties on the magnitudes reflect a small degree of non - simultaneity in the spectral and photometric data as well as the need to transform from i ( where the data were more numerous ) to r. since spectral and photometric data were taken within an hour of each other , except at maximum light ( when the brightness is nearly constant with time ) and since the color variation is quite small ( @xmath00.1 mag in r - i over the full brightness range ) , the uncertainty in r is only @xmath00.1 mag .",
    "julian dates for each observation , measured i magnitudes , derived r and v magnitudes , measured ews , and derived h@xmath1 and [ oi ] fluxes are listed in table 1 .",
    "the ew measurements refer to the entire profile , both red- and blue - shifted components combined . on figs . 2 and 3 , the arrows indicate where hi nebular emission could have affected the profile , whereas on fig",
    ". 4 the arrow indicates where [ oi ] @xmath86300 from the night sky may not have been removed completely .",
    "figure 2 shows that dramatic changes occurred in the h@xmath1 emission line profile of kh 15d during eclipse and egress . out of eclipse",
    ", the star appears to be a wtts with an ew(h@xmath1 ) @xmath02  , but with a double - peaked profile , having a central absorption and faint , but clearly detectable broad wings . a comparison with the h@xmath1 profiles of other wttss @xcite shows that only 3 out of 19 such stars exhibited double - peaked profiles similar to kh 15d , with ux tau a being the most similar ( see @xcite ) .",
    "most wttss show narrow , single - peaked emission lines .",
    "it is also interesting that the central absorption feature appears to extend below the stellar continuum .",
    "this is unusual for any tts , weak or classical . during eclipse and egress ,",
    "the  natural coronagraph \" effect is clear . near mid - eclipse",
    ", the ew of h@xmath1 grows to @xmath040  , while the relative flux drops by @xmath050% . during egress",
    "the ew rises to @xmath070  , as the flux increases , exceeding even its out - of - eclipse value . in all cases ,",
    "a double - peaked profile is observed .",
    "the emission line profile during mid - eclipse extends to @xmath2 200 km / s with significantly less flux in the extended wings , as compared to the profile during egress , which extends to @xmath2 300 km / s .",
    "figure 3 shows the corresponding h@xmath3 line profiles .",
    "again , dramatic ew and line profile changes are evident .",
    "although the out - of - eclipse h@xmath3 line profile is heavily affected by the underlying stellar absorption spectrum , it is similar to h@xmath1 . in the egress spectrum",
    ", however , the emission occurs primarily on the blue side with a wing extending to -300 km / s .",
    "the asymmetry in this line is much more striking than h@xmath1 . during mid - eclipse , although little h@xmath3 flux is present , the shape of the line profile appears similar to egress .",
    "the weak features visible in this profile at - 25 km / s are probably due to an improper background subtraction of the h@xmath3 emission from ngc 2264 .",
    "figure 4 shows the emission - line profiles for the [ oi ] 6300  line .",
    "the [ oi ] line , which is weak , but clearly discernable at maximum light , becomes prominent at mid - eclipse and during egress .",
    "the line flux seems to be about the same out of eclipse and during egress , although slightly higher at mid - eclipse .",
    "we caution against any extreme interpretation of this measurement .",
    "the profile during mid - eclipse was disturbed by an improper background subtraction , and we feel that our errors are most likely underestimated . however , this behavior would indicate that none of the [ oi ] emitting zone suffers variable occultation at the phases of our observations .",
    "this is fully expected given the spatial extent of the ( bipolar ) forbidden line emitting regions in cttss .",
    "the peak of the high velocity component of the [ oi ] emission in typical cttss originates at about 30 au from the star @xcite .",
    "the ew of the [ oi ] @xmath86300 line in the out - of - eclipse spectrum is about 0.17  , which is quite large for a wtts .",
    "only one of the ten wttss in table 3 of @xcite has a detectable [ oi ] @xmath86300 line ( with an ew = 0.5  ) .",
    "the others have upper limits of about 0.06  .",
    "most cttss in that table , on the other hand , have ews of 0.5 - 3  .",
    "the profiles obtained during mid - eclipse and egress suggest that we have two emission peaks , at about -20 and + 18 km / s with emission wings extending -60 to + 50 km / s , respectively .",
    "these profiles are quite different from the [ oi ] @xmath86300 profile seen in most strong - emission cttss ( with strong veiling ) , which often have a high - velocity component at -100 to -150 km / s ( resulting from the jet ) and a low - velocity component at about -20 km / s @xcite . in addition",
    ", the profile is quite different from that of a ctts with small veiling and ir excess ( see the bottom profile in figure 11 of @xcite ) .",
    "these latter profiles are usually single - peaked and unshifted in velocity . although the profile shape for kh 15d is not fully clear due to imperfect subtraction of the emission of [ oi ] at 6300  in the night sky , it is most likely double - peaked .",
    "such a profile can be most easily explained by a bipolar jet moving nearly perpendicular to the line of sight , quite consistent with our expectation that the disk associated with kh 15d is viewed nearly edge on , resulting in a very small radial velocity separation between the two jets .",
    "the profile catalog of @xcite contains several examples of bipolar jet sources ( rw aur , as 353a , dd tau ) , where the two jet components are clearly separated due to favorable inclination angles .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that we do not yet know the geometry of the kh 15d system . in particular , it is not certain whether the occultation proceeds along a line perpendicular to or parallel to the rotation axis of the k7 star ( or neither ) or to what extent the rotation axis , the presumed stellar magnetic axis and the orbital plane are aligned .",
    "it is not even known whether , relative to the system s center of mass , it is the k7 star or the occulting matter which is primarily in motion .",
    "detailed modeling of the system must obviously await clarification of these basic issues .",
    "however , a preliminary qualitative interpretation of the emission line variations is possible and provided in this section .",
    "we believe that the observed spectral variations of kh 15d can be understood qualitatively in terms of a weakly accreting ,  scaled down \" classical t tauri star ( see e.g. , @xcite ) whose photosphere and magnetosphere are periodically occulted by a relatively sharp knife - edge ( as described in @xcite , their fig . 5 ) .",
    "we expect such a star to have a bipolar jet region , which we assume , by analogy with the ctts , is revealed by the forbidden emission line radiation . assuming a jet velocity of 200 km / s ( which is the average jet velocity for cttss derived by @xcite ) and adopting a radial velocity of @xmath2 20 km / s for the [ oi ] @xmath86300 peaks",
    ", we derive an inclination angle for the jet to the line of sight of 84@xmath9 .",
    "this is consistent with a general picture for the system in which we view the k7 star close to the orbital plane of its circumstellar ( or circumbinary ) disk and the jets emerge roughly perpendicular to the disk plane , as for the star associated with hh 30 and other examples imaged by the hubble space telescope @xcite .",
    "the absence of any significant variation in the profiles or flux of the forbidden line radiation during eclipse is consistent with the expectation , based on the ctts analogy , that it arises at distances of tens of au s from the star , beyond the region variably occulted .",
    "the behavior of the hydrogen lines is complex because some components do arise close to the star and , therefore , suffer variable occultation effects along with the photosphere .",
    "since we expect that the h@xmath1 line has a much higher optical depth than the h@xmath3 line , it is obvious that any emission line region will be more extended in h@xmath1 than h@xmath3 .",
    "if we assume that the magnetic axis of the k7 star is tilted toward us at @xmath0 5 - 10@xmath9 , which is a reasonable assumption supported by the [ oi ] line profiles , at mid - eclipse , one can qualitatively understand the h@xmath1 line profile as resulting from low velocity material in the outer , more extended h@xmath1 emission region while the star and the h@xmath3 line forming region are obscured by the occulting disk material .",
    "this would also explain why there is almost no h@xmath3 flux during mid - eclipse .",
    "during egress , we expect most of the h@xmath1 emission line region , as well as some of the h@xmath3 emission line region , which is closer to the star , to be visible .",
    "the h@xmath1 line profile during egress has a low velocity emission peak with a central absorption feature similar to what is seen in the out - of - eclipse profile .",
    "additionally , two `` shoulders '' appear along the profile at about @xmath2 150 km / s extending out to @xmath2 300 km / s .",
    "these `` shoulders '' could be due to material rotating in the outer parts of the magnetosphere .",
    "however , given that the @xmath6 is measured to be @xmath7 5 km / s , and that the magnetosphere only extends out to about 5 - 6 stellar radii , the maximum rotational velocity is about 5 - 6 @xmath6 or 25 - 30 km / s , making it difficult to explain the h@xmath1 emission - line profile with a rotating magnetopshere .",
    "a more attractive hypothesis is that the high velocity `` shoulders '' on the h@xmath1 line , so prominent in the egress spectrum , arise from material falling along magnetic accretion columns .",
    "this interpretation can also qualitatively account for the h@xmath3 emission line profile during egress . adopting values for the mass and radius of the k7 star from table 1 of @xcite ,",
    "a free - fall velocity of about 380 km / s can be associated with material at the surface of the star .",
    "since h@xmath3 is produced much closer to the star , the blue - shifted wing extending to nearly -350 km / s could be representative of material accreting along magnetic field lines near the pole .",
    "the asymmetry seen in the h@xmath3 emission line profile is most likely due to the fact that the star is slightly inclined toward our line of sight .",
    "the reappearance of both a blue and red wing to the h@xmath1 line during the early part of egress , when most of the stellar photosphere is still occulted , shows that both red - shifted and blue - shifted gas is present along the same line of sight towards the small portion of the photosphere and magnetosphere that is being uncovered first .",
    "this also supports an accretion interpretation as opposed , say , to a rotation interpretation for the high velocities .",
    "it appears that kh 15d , although clearly a wtts by the usual criteria of weak h@xmath1 emission , absence of uv or ir excess emission , and relative photometric stability , is still undergoing active accretion and driving a bipolar outflow .",
    "it provides a cautionary example against assuming that all stars with wtts characteristics no longer have accretion disks . the unique geometry of this system , in which a relatively sharp - edged occulting mask crosses the photosphere has created a  natural cornagraph \" which enhances the visibility of the star s magnetosphere during eclipse .",
    "the occultation also evidently crosses the inner portion of the star s magnetosphere , where high velocity gas motions arise , probably from magnetically channeled accretion .",
    "synoptic studies of this star may ultimately allow us to reconstruct aspects of the structure of its magnetosphere with spatial resolution that will be unobtainable in other objects for decades to come .",
