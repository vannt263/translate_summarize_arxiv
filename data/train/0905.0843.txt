    "following its launch in june 2008 , the _ fermi _ gamma - ray telescope began to survey the sky at energies greater than 100 mev .",
    "the catalogue of bright sources detected during the first 3 months of observations has recently been published by abdo et al .",
    "( 2009a ) listing 205 objects with statistical significance greater than 10@xmath7 .",
    "both galactic and extragalactic populations are visible .",
    "the agn class consisting of 121 sources is the largest in the catalogue .",
    "it contains mostly blazars ( bl lac , flat spectrum radio quasars and objects of uncertain classification ) , but also 2 radio galaxies ( cena and ngc 1275 ) and the lmc .",
    "the galactic population is primarily made of pulsars ( 29 members ) , plus 2 high mass x - rays binaries , a globular cluster ( or most likely a source in it ) and the galactic centre .",
    "thirty - seven of the _ fermi _ sources have no obvious counterparts at other wavelengths and are therefore still unclassified . searching for counterparts of these sources is of course a primary objective of the survey work but it is made difficult by the good but still large _ fermi _ error circles .",
    "cross - correlations with catalogues in other wavebands can be used as a useful tool with which to restrict the positional uncertainty of the objects detected by _",
    "fermi _ and therefore to facilitate the identification process .",
    "in particular , observations at softer x - ray energies , where the positional accuracy is much better , could be an invaluable aid in the identification and classification process but the use of data at other wavebands , for example the radio , is also useful to identify peculiar and potentially / interesting candidate objects .",
    "follow - up optical spectroscopy of likely candidates can then provide classification of interesting sources and consequently a firm identification . in this letter",
    "we report on the nature of the source 0fgl j2001.0 + 4352 , one of the still unidentified objects in the _ fermi _ catalogue .",
    "we use unpublished _ xmm - newton _ and _ swift_/xrt data to localise the x - ray counterpart of this high energy emitter and to characterise its x - ray spectrum .",
    "we further identify its radio counterpart and discuss its spectral properties .",
    "finally , we report on an optical follow - up observation which provides the first source classification .",
    "all these data point to an identification of the mev / gev source with a blazar of bl lac type .",
    "0fgl j2001.0 + 4352 is reported in the first _ fermi _ catalogue ( abdo et al .",
    "2009a ) as a source located close to the galactic plane ( 7.1 degrees in galactic latitude ) and having ra(j2000)= 20@xmath801@xmath905@xmath10.28 and dec(j2000)= + 43@xmath1152@xmath1215@xmath13.6 with a positional @xmath14 uncertainty of 0.069 degrees . due to the faint flux and hard spectrum only an upper limit ( @xmath15 ph @xmath2 s@xmath3 )",
    "is reported in the 0.11 gev band , while in the 1100 gev range the flux is ( 7.8@xmath01.2 ) @xmath1 ph @xmath2 s@xmath3 .",
    "the source is not associated with any previously known gamma - ray object . using the method developed by stephen et al .",
    "( 2005,2006 ) to search for correlations between x - ray objects from various catalogues and _ fermi _ sources , we find a likely match between the xmm slew source ( saxton et al .",
    "2008 ) xmmsl1 j200112.7 + 435255 and 0fgl j2001.0 + 4352 .",
    "the xmm slew source has a positional uncertainty of only 4.51@xmath13 ; the source 0.212 kev flux is @xmath5@xmath16 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 with @xmath560@xmath17 of the counts coming from the softest x - ray band ( 0.22 kev ) . on january 21 , 2009 _ swift_/xrt ( gehrels et al .",
    "2004 ) carried out an observation of 7.7 ks of the sky region containing the _ fermi _ source , thus allowing a comparison with the _ xmm - newton _ data .",
    "xrt data reduction was performed using the xrtdas standard data pipeline package ( xrtpipeline v. 0.12.1 ) , in order to produce screened event files .",
    "all data were extracted only in the photon counting ( pc ) mode ( hill et al .",
    "2004 ) , adopting the standard grade filtering ( 012 for pc ) according to the xrt nomenclature .",
    "images have been extracted in the 0.310 kev band and searched for significant excesses falling within or around the _ fermi _ error circle . a clear excess is observed in the xrt map with a significance of @xmath518@xmath7 at a position corresponding to ra(j2000)= 20@xmath801@xmath1812@xmath10.88 and dec(j2000)= + 43@xmath1152@xmath1255@xmath13.0 and with an associated uncertainty of 3.7@xmath13 ( 90% confidence level ) .",
    "this position is fully compatible with that reported in the xmm slew catalogue ; figure  [ fig1 ] shows the xrt 0.310 kev image of the region surrounding 0fgl j2001.0 + 4352 with superimposed both the _ fermi _ and _ xmm slew _ error circles .",
    "one more x - ray source ( # 1 in the image ) falls within the positional uncertainty of the mev object but it is much weaker ( the detection is around 3@xmath7 ) and it disappears above 3 kev and it has no radio counterpart ; it can reasonably be associated with a radio quiet agn or a stellar object and not to a gev emitter .",
    "events for spectral analysis were extracted within a circular region of radius 20@xmath13 , centered on the source position , which encloses about 90% of the psf at 1.5 kev ( see moretti et al .",
    "the background was taken from source - free regions close to the x - ray source of interest here , using circular regions with different radii in order to ensure an evenly sampled background .",
    "the source spectrum was then extracted from the corresponding event file using the xselect v.2.4 software and binned using grppha in an appropriate way , so that the @xmath19 statistic could be applied .",
    "we used version v.011 of the response matrices and create the relative ancillary response file _ arf _ using the task xrtmkarf v. 0.5.6 .",
    "the quality of the xrt data does not allow to fit more complex models than a simple power law filtered by the galactic absorption which in the direction of the source is @xmath20 @xmath2 ( kalberla et al .",
    "2005 ; dickey & lockman , 1990 ) .",
    "this model provides a photon index @xmath21 and a 0.212 kev flux of @xmath4 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 , a factor of 2.9 lower than the one reported in the xmm slew survey ; we therefore conclude that the source is a persistent one but variable in flux over time .",
    "the radio image of the sky region of interest here has been taken from the nvss ( nrao vla sky survey , condon et al .",
    "1998 ) which covers the sky north of declination ( j2000.0 ) 40 degrees at 1.4 ghz .",
    "this survey provides 45 arcsecond fwhm angular resolution and nearly uniform sensitivity ; the rms uncertainties in right ascension and declination are about 1 arcsecond for sources stronger than 15 mjy .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] is an nvss image cut - out with overimposed the _ fermi _ error circle and xrt / xmm slew positions .",
    "it is clear that a strong radio source is present in the _ fermi _ error circle and further coincides with the x - ray object detected both by _ swift _ and _ xmm - newton_. this radio counterpart is located at ra(j2000)= 20@xmath801@xmath2213@xmath10.15 and dec(j2000)= + 43@xmath1152@xmath1253@xmath13.1 ( 0.6@xmath13 uncertainty ) and has a 1.4 ghz flux of @xmath5104 mjy . this source ( named mg4 j200112 + 4352 in ned and hereafter ) has been extensively observed at radio frequencies and appears in many radio catalogues although its nature has been poorly studied so far . to provide more information on this source ,",
    "we have used specfind ( vollmer et al . 2005 ) and cats ( the on - line astrophysical catalogs support system , at http://cats.sao.ru/ ; see also verkhodanov et al .",
    "1997 ) ; both are tools used to cross - identify radio sources in various catalogues on the basis of self - consistent spectral index as well as position .",
    "this allows us to combine data at different frequencies ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) and to estimate the source spectral index ( @xmath23 ) , which in the case of mg4 j200112 + 4352 is around 0.1 ( see also ned ) ; the source is therefore a flat spectrum object and thus possibly associated with a blazar type agn .",

    "within the respective x - ray / radio uncertainties , we find an optical / near - infrared source which has broad - band photometry available in the heasarc database and which we report in table  [ tab2 ] . from this table",
    "is evident the possibility that the source may be variable in the optical ; even taking into account uncertainties due to differences in the observations set - up such as detector apertures , filter sensitivities , etc , the change in magnitude is sufficiently high to suggest a change in the source flux at least in the optical bands . to firmly establish the nature of this x - ray / radio source , we next arranged and carried out a spectroscopic observation of its optical counterpart , usno ",
    "b1.0 1338 - 0359203 ( see figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the source was spectroscopically observed on 14 march 2009 with the bologna astronomical observatory 1.52-metre `` g.d .",

    "observations started at 02:49 ut ; three 1800 s spectra were acquired . in all exposures , grism # 4 and a slit width of @xmath25 were used , providing a 35008700   nominal spectral coverage .",
    "the use of this setup secured a final dispersion of 4.0   / pix for all spectra .",
    "after cosmic - ray rejection , the spectra were reduced , background subtracted and optimally extracted ( horne 1986 ) using iraf .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed using he - ar lamps acquired soon after each spectroscopic exposure ; all spectra were then flux - calibrated using the spectrophotometric standard bd+28@xmath264211 ( oke 1990 ) .",
    "finally , the spectra were stacked together to increase the s / n ratio .",
    "the wavelength calibration uncertainty was @xmath50.5    for all cases ; this was checked using the positions of background night sky lines .",

    "the spectral features due to galactic interstellar absorption are labeled .",
    "the symbol @xmath29 indicates atmospheric telluric absorption bands . _ bottom panel _ : the same spectrum , normalized to the continuum level . ]",
    "the optical spectrum of the source ( figure  [ fig4 ] ) shows a nearly featureless continuum , with only the atmospheric telluric lines and the galactic diffuse interstellar band at 6280   apparent in absorption .",
    "no other line , either in absorption or in emission , is firmly detected .",
    "regrettably this fact , also due to the relatively low signal - to - noise ratio of our data , does not allow us to pinpoint the redshift of this source .",
    "nevertheless , at about 4800   there seems to be a slope change in the optical spectrum .",
    "this may be due to a non - thermal component which merges with the light from the host galaxy , almost completely diluting the ca break at @xmath54000  . in this case",
    ", we can give a rough estimate of the source redshift as @xmath50.2 .",
    "after correction for the intervening galactic reddening , @xmath30 mag ( schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) , the spectrum appears intrinsically blue and resembles those of bl lac agns ( see e.g. sbarufatti et al .",
    "2009 and references therein ) .",
    "this classification is also confirmed using the agn classification approach of laurent - muehleisen et al .",
    "mg4 j200112 + 4352 is clearly a bright radio / x - ray source optically identified here as a bl lac object .",
    "this by itself provide strong evidence that it is the counterpart of the _ fermi _ source .",
    "the variability observed in the x - ray / optical band and the flat spectrum observed in radio further reinforce this conclusion .",
    "are however the overall characteristics of the source compatible with other _ fermi _ identified bl lacs ?",
    "indeed in the gamma ( @xmath31100 mev ) versus radio ( 8.4 ghz ) flux diagram mg4 j200112 + 435 is located well in the region populated by bl lac objects ( see fig . 14 in abdo et al .",
    "also , the fluxes measured in the gev bands suggest a hard source , i.e. more appropriate to a bl lac object than to a flat spectrum radio quasar which is the other agn typology detected by _",
    "( abdo et al .",
    "finally , the location of the source in the x - ray ( 0.52 kev ) versus radio ( 1.4 ghz ) flux density plot indicates agreement with the positions of other _ fermi _ detected bl lac objects and further suggests that mg4 j200112 + 4352 might be either a high frequency peaked blazar ( hbl ) or an intermediate frequency peaked blazar ( ibl ) . in the widely adopted scenario of blazars , a single population of high - energy electrons in a relativistic jet radiate from the radio / fir to the uv- soft x - ray by the synchrotron process and at higher frequencies by inverse compton scattering soft - target photons present either in the jet ( synchrotron self - compton [ ssc ] model ) , in the surrounding material ( external compton [ ec ] model ) , or in both ( ghisellini et al .",
    "1998 and references therein ) . therefore , a strong signature of the blazar nature of a source is a double peaked structure in the spectral energy distribution or sed , with the synchrotron component peaking anywhere from infrared to x - rays and the inverse compton extending up to gev or even tev gamma - rays . in figure",
    "[ fig5 ] , we construct the non - simultaneous sed of this enigmatic object by combining data collected in this work ; to cover as many frequencies as possible we have also used upper limits obtained from the third _ integral_/ibis survey ( bird et al . 2007 ) . for the mev / gev data we have assumed a photon index of 2.0 as typically found in bl lac objects by",
    "_ fermi_/lat ( abdo et al .",
    "2009b ) . to deal with flux variability ,",
    "we have plotted in the sed both minimum and maximum values found in the optical and x - rays wavebands .",
    "the source sed is clearly that of a hbl : the synchrotron emission is located close to the optical / uv band , the x - ray spectrum is steep ( hence belonging to the synchrotron component ) and the compton emission has a maximum in the gev domain .",
    "we therefore conclude that all observational evidences point to the association of the _ fermi _ source 0fgl j2001.0 + 4352 with the high frequency peaked bl lac mg4 j200112 + 4352 .",
    "through x - ray observations , we have been able to identify the counterpart of the newly discovered _ fermi _ source 0fgl j2001.0 + 4352 and to associate it with the radio source mg4 j200112 + 4352 so far optically unclassified .",
    "optical follow - up observations have provided the first optical spectrum of the source , which is a new bl lac object .",
    "the source has many peculiar features which are typical of a blazar : it is a radio bright object with a flat spectrum ; it is likely variable at x - ray and optical frequencies ; it is also most likely a hbl as suggested by its sed .",
