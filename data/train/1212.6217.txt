    "few - body phenomena play important roles across all disciplines of physics , including atomic and molecular physics , chemical physics , nuclear and particle physics , and condensed matter physics .",
    "progress in solving and understanding the quantum mechanical few - body problem has been driven , roughly speaking , by one or more of the following three aspects : _ ( i ) _ using well - established algorithms , the steady increase of computational resources has made it possible to tackle problems that were impossible to tackle a decade or even just a few years ago . _",
    "( ii ) _ a number of model systems have been investigated analytically , semi - analytically or numerically , providing crucial insights into some of the low - energy processes that govern the few - body dynamics . _ ( iii ) _ more efficient numerical schemes that are not only applicable to the three - body problem but also to four- and higher - body problems have been developed .",
    "this paper extends the correlated gaussian hyperspherical ( cghs ) or hyperspherical explicitly correlated gaussian ( hecg ) approach  @xcite . in earlier work , von stecher and greene  @xcite considered three- and four - body systems with vanishing angular momentum @xmath4 and positive parity @xmath2 . here , we extend the approach to systems with finite angular momentum @xmath4 .",
    "although the overall scheme developed for systems with @xmath5 symmetry carries over to systems with finite angular momentum , the determination of compact expressions for the matrix elements associated with finite angular momentum states is significantly more involved than that for states with @xmath5 symmetry .",
    "the hecg approach provides an efficient numerical scheme for solving few - body problems .",
    "it is a basis set expansion type approach , which combines elements of the aspects _ ( i)_-_(iii ) _ mentioned above . in particular",
    ", the use of hyperspherical coordinates  @xcite within the framework of explicitly correlated gaussian ( ecg ) basis functions  @xcite allows us to take advantage of the machinery developed for bound state calculations while at the same time enables us to describe the scattering continuum .",
    "although significant progress has been made  @xcite , in general , the determination of scattering quantities is significantly more involved than that of bound state quantities , and the four- , five- and higher - body scattering continua are comparatively poorly understood .",
    "thus , the framework developed in this work for systems with @xmath6 and @xmath7 symmetry provides a promising step forward .",
    "the hecg approach is quite general and applicable to a wide range of few - body systems . as an application",
    ", we consider the four - particle system consisting of three identical fermions and an impurity whose mass is lighter than that of the majority species .",
    "we assume interspecies short - range @xmath8-wave interactions and investigate the system properties of the energetically lowest - lying @xmath7 state as a function of the mass ratio @xmath9 between the majority particles and the impurity particle .",
    "these finite angular momentum states are interesting since universal four - body bound states have been predicted to exist if the two - body @xmath8-wave scattering length is positive and @xmath10  @xcite . moreover , for @xmath11 , the @xmath12 system with @xmath7 symmetry has been predicted to support four - body efimov states  @xcite ; in this mass ratio regime , three - body efimov states are absent  @xcite .",
    "this work determines and interprets the hyperangular eigen value of the @xmath12 system with infinitely large interspecies @xmath8-wave scattering length in the limit that the hyperradius is much larger than the range of the underlying two - body potential .",
