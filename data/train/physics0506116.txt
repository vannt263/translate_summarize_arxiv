    "interaction among processes with several length and time scales is common to a variety of complex systems .",
    "for instance , the long - range temporal correlations found in signals from a variety of fields can be associated with an interplay of a number of time scales  @xcite . in particular",
    ", it is an extended belief that the persistence observed in the temperature fluctuations of the earth s atmosphere is a consequence of its feedback with slower dynamical components in the climate system , like the oceans and earth s surface  @xcite .",
    "persistence at short time scales is related to the everyday life observation where similar weather conditions are likely to be experienced over a given region in a time scale of a few days .",
    "the existence of these short - term correlations make weather forecasting possible .",
    "the climate s persistence is also found for larger time scales , however its characterization is a more difficult task  @xcite . in some recent experiments ,",
    "the temperature records from different places around the globe have been analyzed .",
    "the observations indicate the existence of universal power - laws @xmath0 describing the correlations of the temperature fluctuations around its mean seasonal value .",
    "although there is some disagreement about the value of the exponent @xmath1 , it has been firmly established that the persistence in temperature fluctuations can indeed be characterized by power - law autocorrelation functions  @xcite .",
    "it has been reported by some authors that for time scales that range from @xmath2 to @xmath3 years , correlations measured on data from meteorologic stations placed on small islands decay with an exponent @xmath4 , while for continental stations data are closer to @xmath5  @xcite . according to other authors  @xcite , the persistence is even more pronounced for the oceanic regions ( being roughly characterized by a @xmath6 noise ) , while in the inner continents @xmath7 ( in terms of the power spectrum , a white noise at low frequencies ) , with a transition region in the coastal zones in which @xmath5 .",
    "the emergence of long - range temporal correlations is a non - trivial feature that can be used to test models of the earth s climate  @xcite .",
    "the understanding of the long - range temporal correlations is fundamental because they characterize the interaction among the different climate components  @xcite .",
    "there is some controversy with respect to the description made by large scale models of the atmospheric temperature variability  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present letter is to introduce a conceptual stochastic model for the fluctuations of the earth s atmospheric temperature , or more precisely , its radiated energy ( for a survey on conceptual climate models see , for instance , imkeller and monahan  @xcite ) .",
    "it will be shown that the model displays qualitative features that closely resemble observations .",
    "in contrast with other simple stochastic models of atmospheric temperature fluctuations , like autoregressive models  @xcite , all the parameters of the presented model have direct physical interpretation .",
    "additionally , as it will be discussed below , the model introduced here also reveals statistical features that are reminiscent of recent observations on the spatial structure of the climate network .",
    "therefore , this work is intended to be a contribution towards the construction of realistic and unexpensive algorithms for earth s climate simulation .",
    "the model is based on energy balance  @xcite . on earth , as in other planets with a solid crust , the influx of solar radiation is balanced by the outflow from the surface and the atmosphere . in the simplest description of this process ,",
    "the earth is treated as a single point .",
    "let us denote by @xmath8 and @xmath9 the global averages of the radiation emitted by the atmosphere and by the surface ( oceans and land ) , respectively .",
    "a fraction of the sun s total radiation is immediately reflected back into space and another is absorbed by the atmosphere . the remainder of the flux is transmitted through the atmosphere and reaches the surface , which in turn absorbs some of the radiation and reflects the rest .",
    "the radiation absorbed by the surface is then radiated back as heat .",
    "the surface radiates the absorbed energy in the infrared ( ir ) region of the spectra .",
    "it turns out that the atmosphere is not transparent to ir radiation , essentialy due to the presence of the so - called greenhouse gases .",
    "let us denote by @xmath10 the fraction of ir radiation absorbed by the atmosphere .",
    "a fraction @xmath11 of the total radiation absorbed by the atmosphere is directed towards the surface and the rest is finally lost into space .",
    "all these considerations are put together in the well known zero dimensional energy balance model : @xmath12    where constants @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the net contribution made to @xmath8 and @xmath9 by the solar radiation flux , taking into account that some heat is removed by water evaporation from the surface .",
    "the constant @xmath10 is called the infrared ( ir ) absorption coefficient .",
    "all the constants in eqs .",
    "( [ zero ] ) are calculated by averaging over a year and over the entire earth s surface .",
    "assuming a blackbody process , the average atmosphere s temperature is given by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the stefan  boltzmann constant . in spite of its simplicity , the zero dimensional energy balance model is capable of predicting with very good accuracy the mean earth s surface temperature .",
    "another interesting prediction of the zero dimensional energy balance model is the increment of the mean temperature as the coupling parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 grow .    in this letter",
    "a spatially extended and time - dependent generalization of model ( [ zero ] ) is introduced .",
    "the letter is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ model ] the model is introduced and the temporal and spatial correlations are discussed numerically . a reduced version of the model is constructed and formally solved in the framework of the langevin approach . a discussion of the statistical properties of the solution is given . some conclusions and future directions",

    "[ conclusions ] .",

    "the atmosphere is expected to have shorter intrinsic response times than that of the surface .",
    "the radiation emitted by the surface at time @xmath29 in cell @xmath28 is represented by @xmath30 .",
    "the noise reflects the more rapid variations , or @xmath31 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are taken .",
    "the constants @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are assumed to be independent variables , such that averages over index ( in the limit @xmath36 ) give the corresponding values of the parameters of the zero dimensional energy balance model , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ; and the effective inverse response times for the atmosphere and the surface .",

    "this result shows that model ( [ model ] ) is capable of representing with good approximation the mean behavior of energy in the coupled atmosphere  surface system .",
    "now it will be argued that eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) can give realistic descriptions of temperature fluctuations as well . a large variability over the intrinsic characteristic times of the surface around the globe",
    "is expected to exist , as a consequence of the different response times present in the geosphere , hydrosphere , cryosphere and biosphere . at first instance , this situation is modeled by treating the @xmath33 s like independent random variables taken from a uniform probability distribution . on the other hand , under the basis of the relative homogeneity of the atmosphere composition , it will be assumed by now that the response time to perturbations of the atmosphere is the same in all cells . in what follows ,",
    "the value @xmath38 is used . under these assumptions ,",
    "the time unit is defined as the mean atmospheric response time .",

    "the main goal is limited to explore the capabilities of the model ( [ model ] ) , in order to give qualitatively realistic statistical descriptions of the temperature fluctuations present in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "figure [ fig1](a ) is a log  log plot of the power spectrum of the time series of the atmosphere s temperature in a particular cell .",
    "this time series is obtained from the corresponding time series for @xmath40 under the assumption of a blackbody process .",

    "the features shown by the spatially extended stochastic model presented here motivates the construction of realistic and simple algorithms for the prediction of the earth s temperature distribution and fluctuations . in this spatially extended situation",
