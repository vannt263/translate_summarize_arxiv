    "current possibilities include instabilities associated with late - stage nuclear burning ( shiode & quataert 2014 ; smith & arnett 2014 ) , violent binary encounters ( smith & frew 2011 ) , and even stellar mergers involving massive binary star systems ( smith et al .",

    "photometry , the @xmath4 colour of the remnant , shown in figure[fig : color ] , appears unchanged from the stellar precursor colour .",
    "one possible explanation for the apparent lack of reddening is that the absorbing dust grains could be larger than the 0.1@xmath30 m radius we assumed in our simple dust model , and closer to 1.0@xmath30 m , which would result in less attenuation of stellar light .",
    "this is the case in @xmath0car s homunculus nebula , which , although very dusty , is less effective at absorbing the uv - optical flux of the central star than in the case of smaller grains ( rodgers 1971 ; smith 2010 ) . for relatively large grains ,",
    "the thermal dust emission might be more appropriately modeled by a modified black body ( a  grey body \" ) , where the emissivity of the dust is proportional to @xmath26 .",
    "in fact , a grey - body form yields the best match to the ir component of the sed in figure[fig : sed ] .",
    "the post - eruption uv - ir sed of the ngc4490-ot , which appears similar to that of snhunt248 , was also shown to be consistent with such a grey - body dust component ( in that case , optical colours were not available for the stellar precursor ) .",
    "it is also possible that the post - eruption source is intrinsically much bluer than it appears , and was coincidentally reddened by dust back to a colour that is comparable to that of the stellar precursor .",

    "( 2015 ) , revealing a hotter star lying underneath ?",
    "another explanation for the lack of uv - optical attenuation could be that the emitting dust is distributed in an aspherical configuration that does not effectively obscure the star along our line of sight ; this possibility is interesting in the context of the stellar - merger hypothesis discussed in the next section .",

    "2011 ) and the extinction relation of cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) .",
    "the other seds from the literature account for interstellar extinction only.,width=336 ]    we must also address the possibility that the post - outburst ir excess is the result of pre - existing circumstellar dust that was shock heated as the fast outflow from the 2014 eruption overran the slow csm from the cool - hypergiant precursor . unfortunately , our _ spitzer _ mid - ir upper limits on the stellar precursor are not sufficiently deep to provide a meaningful constraint on the pre - existing dust mass , or to tell if the dust mass was lower before the eruption .",
    "for example , in figure[fig : pre_sed ] , we show the sed of snhunt248 along with those of several galactic cool hypergiants that have measured circumstellar dust masses in the literature .",
    "our limits are mutually consistent with a system like @xmath32cas , which has a rather low estimated dust mass of @xmath34m@xmath6 ( jura & kleinmann 1990 ) and more extreme dusty systems , like irc@xmath3110420 ( shenoy et al .",
    "2016 ) and iras17163@xmath223907 ( lagadec et al . 2011 ) , the latter of which has a much larger dust mass of @xmath35m@xmath6 .",
    "the comparison in figure[fig : pre_sed ] does , however , suggest that the ir excess from a system such as vycma , with a total dust mass of @xmath36m@xmath6 ( harwit et al . 2001 ; muller et al .",
    "2007 ) , would have been detectable with our photometry at 4.5@xmath30 m .",
    "we conclude that the @xmath19m@xmath6 dust mass we inferred _ post _ eruption could have been pre - existing yet not detectable by our _ spitzer _ observations . again , however , the relatively high brightness of the optical precursor star in the @xmath37 and @xmath8 bands , when compared to the other hypergiants in ( figure[fig : pre_sed ] ) , would suggest that the stellar precursor of snhunt248 did not suffer a comparable level of attenuation by circumstellar dust .",
    "a light echo of the 2014 eruption off of outer dusty csm is another potential contributor to the source flux at late times , which could result in delayed scattering of uv - optical light and thermal reprocessing of the fraction of light that gets absorbed by the dust . however , assuming that such an echo is dominated by light from the peak of the outburst and obeys a @xmath38 wavelength dependence ( e.g. , see fox et al .",
    "2015 ) , while suffering the same extinction as the precursor , the expected uv - optical sed is totally inconsistent with the observed sed at @xmath31370 days ( see figure[fig : sed ] ) .",
    "the thermal - ir remnant also appears to be inconsistent with thermal reprocessing of an echo , as the dust temperature requires a luminosity that is far above the peak of the 2014 event .",
    "this was determined using the same line of reasoning invoked for the analysis of the remnant of ngc4490-ot ( see smith et al .",
    "2016 , their  3.2.3 ) . assuming the ratio of the efficiencies of uv absorption to ir emission @xmath39 ( smith et al . 2016 ) , the luminosity required to heat dust at a distance @xmath40 to a temperature @xmath41 can be expressed as @xmath42 . at 328 days the minimum distance of the echo - heated dust is @xmath43pc .",
    "thus , the range of possible dust temperatures inferred from our model ( 6501450k ) requires a peak outburst luminosity in the range ( 125 ) @xmath44l@xmath6 , which is at least 3 orders of magnitude higher than the observed peak of the 2014 outburst .",
    "furthermore , the temperature evolution of a thermally reprocessed echo is given by @xmath45 ( fox et al .",
    "2011 , 2015 ) , and so we would have expected the temperature between 133 days and 325 days to have dropped from @xmath46k to @xmath47k ; instead , the temperature evolution is consistent with no change between these epochs . we therefore conclude that a light echo is probably not the source of the late - time uv - optical source and its thermal counterpart .    finally , it is possible that the the uv - optical flux of the point source is not from the same star that generated the 2014 outburst , and is a nearby star , star cluster , or a companion to the eruptive source .",
    "future epochs of multi - wavelength photometry will be necessary to test this possibility ; if the uv - optical flux is dominated by separate neighbouring stellar sources , then we expect no significant change with time .",
    "the energy source of the 2014 eruption is uncertain .",
    "the structure of the outburst light curve , the outflow velocity , and the large - amplitude pre - outburst variability detected for decades prior might provide clues . we speculate that the cool - hypergiant precursor was a massive interacting binary . could snhunt248 s 2014 event have been a merger burst marking the coalescence of two massive stars ?",
    "such event might be more common than previously thought ( kochanek 2014 ) .",
    "the merger hypothesis was invoked as the favoured interpretation of ngc4490-ot ( smith et al .",
    "2016 ) , whose remnant sed during a similar phase appears very similar to that of snhunt248 , and whose light curve also exhibited a multi - peaked structure .",
    "car is also included .",
    "uncertainties in expansion velocity are included where available.,width=331 ]    figure[fig : merger ] shows the peak outburst luminosity versus outflow velocity line widths , and @xmath0car s velocity measurement is from detailed spectroscopic analysis of the homunculus nebula ( smith et al .",
    "2003 ) . ] for snhunt248 ( mauerhan et al . 2015 ) ; ngc4490-ot ( smith et al .",
    "2016 ) ; the sample of merger candidates presented in pejcha et al .",
    "( 2016a ; their figure  21 ) ; m101-ot , also considered a merger candidate or binary common - envelope ejection event ( blagorodnova et al .",
    "2017 ) ; and @xmath0car ( smith et al . 2003 ; smith & frew 2011 ) .",
    "interestingly , snhunt248 is consistent with the apparent trend exhibited by this sample of merger candidates .",
    "v1309sco was almost certainly a true merger , based on the exquisite light curve that showed the rapidly decreasing orbital period of an inspiraling binary .",
    "both v1309sco and v838mon exhibited a double - peaked light curves , of shorter duration and brightness than snhunt248 and ngc4490-ot , but similar in multi - peaked morphology .",
    "smith et al .",
    "( 2016 ) interpreted ngc4490-ot as a stellar merger involving stars of relatively high mass , and reiterated the suggestion that @xmath0car s historic eruption was the result of a massive merger .",
    "s position in figure[fig : merger ] also fits in with the apparent trend exhibited by other merger candidates .    a double - peaked light curve might be a natural consequence of a stellar merger burst that follows a common - envelope phase .",
    "a close binary of evolved massive stars that are headed for a merger will experience mass transfer , and this can occur even if the primary radius does not fully fill its roche lobe , but fills it up with material from a slow wind ( e.g. , wind roche - lobe overflow , wrlof ; abate et al .",
    "rlof may be nonconservative and wrlof is nonconservative by nature ( i.e. , some mass is lost rather than exchanged ) .",
    "the process leads to the buildup of csm that is concentrated in the equatorial plane of the binary , perhaps forming a spiral pattern ( pejcha et al .",
    "2016a , 2016b ) .",
    "the outflow velocity through the outer lagrange points is proportional to the orbital velocity of the stars .",
    "thus , as the orbital period of the inspiraling stars decreases and the orbital velocity increases , the outflow velocity will increase as well , leading to a pileup of gas with a toroidally enhanced distribution ( e.g. , ohlmann et al .",
    "the subsequent explosive outflow from a merger burst will encounter the toroidal csm distribution and generate radiation from the resulting interaction ( a second peak in the light curve ) .",
    "any interaction - induced dust formation will mirror the geometry of the pre - existing csm .",
    "interestingly , the circumstellar environment of the purported post - merger system v838mon exhibits an equatorial overdensity of dust several hundred au in extent ( chesneau et al .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations have also shown that equatorially enhanced dust formation should be expected in the aftermath of mergers ( pejcha et al .",
    "if snhunt248 was the result of a stellar merger , then the outflow from the previously interacting binary system is likely to be concentrated in the equatorial plane , and any dust formation in the cooling ejecta could exhibit a similar geometry .",
    "therefore , if a post - merger system is suitably inclined , our line of sight to the stellar remnant could be relatively free of obscuring dust .",
    "this is one possible explanation for why the uv - optical remnants of snhunt248 and ngc4490-ot appear to be free of the heavy attenuation that has been associated with many other massive stars after their outbursts ( e.g. , adams et al . 2016 ; kochanek et al . 2012 ) .      the so - called red supergiant ( rsg ) problem refers to the statistically significant lack of nearby core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) of type ii - p stemming from directly identified progenitors with stellar masses in the range 1630m@xmath6 ( smartt et al .",
    "it could be that stars within this mass range might lose their massive hydrogen envelopes to giant super - eddington eruptions ( whatever their cause ) , and thus do not end their lives with the production of normal type ii - p sne ( yoon & cantiello 2010 ) , as rsgs of lower mass do .",
    "the estimated initial mass of snhunt248 is @xmath48 and the 2014 eruption was indeed super - eddington ( mauerhan et al .",
    "2015 ) , so snhunt248 might be relevant in this context .",
    "interestingly , it has been suggested that stars with initial masses near 30m@xmath6 might not be successful at producing bright explosions when their cores collapse , instead producing weak fallback sne or direct collapse to a black hole , either of which might result in very faint or undetectable emission from radioactive decay ( woosley & heger 2012 ; lovegrove & woosley 2013 ; kochanek et al .",
    "2008 , 2014 ; clausen et al .",
    "thus , it is also worth speculating on the possibility of a weak or failed sn as the source of the 2014 eruption of snhunt248 . in figure[fig : lc ] we showed that the latest optical photometry limits the synthesized mass of radioactive @xmath7ni to @xmath49m@xmath6 .",
    "interestingly , the prototype sn impostor sn1997bs ( van dyk et al . 2000 ) exhibited an optical remnant of comparable brightness to snhunt248 at @xmath501yr after its peak , that continued to fade during subsequent coverage ( kochanek et al .",
    "adams & kochanek ( 2015 ) recently showed that the optical - ir remnant of sn1997bs now appears to be consistent with a weak but terminal explosion , as few plausible combinations of obscuring dust and surviving stellar luminosity can explain the characteristics of the present source .",
    "could snhunt248 have suffered a similar fate ?",
    "if so , this would imply that the late - time optical emission , if truly associated with the outbursting source , could be powered by continued shock interaction of an otherwise weak or failed core explosion .",
    "based on the late - time photometry of the uv - optical and mid - ir source at the position of snhunt248 , all we can state with confidence is that , as of june 2015 , the optical brightness is over a factor of 10 less than the faintest pre - outburst level for the stellar precursor , and that there is a thermal counterpart of hot dust with a mass @xmath51m@xmath6 that was probably synthesized in the aftermath of the 2014 eruption .",
    "the luminosity of the thermal dust emission is comparable to the optical luminosity of the hypergiant precursor and thus seems consistent with the absorption of radiation from a surviving stellar source .",
    "however , the uv - optical colour of the late - time source appears inconsistent with significant attenuation by dust . whether the uv - optical source is a separate star or cluster ,",
    "a surviving star from a super - eddington eruption , the byproduct of a massive stellar merger ( see  4.2.1 ) , or the decaying emission from a terminal event , will be elucidated with future uv through ir monitoring of the source using _ hst _ and the _ james webb space telescope_. in particular , an additional epoch of data to track the evolution of the uv - ir sed will allow for the construction of more complex models involving a surviving central source attenuated by an evolving dust component .",
