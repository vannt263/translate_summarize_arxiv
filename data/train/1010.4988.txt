    "a classical problem in actuarial mathematics is to maximize the cumulative expected discounted dividend pay - outs . in the cramr  lundberg setting , this optimization problem was introduced by de finetti ( @xcite ) ; gerber ( @xcite ) proved the existence of an optimal dividend payment strategy and showed that it has a band structure .",
    "the cumulative expected discounted dividend pay - outs is a way to value a company as it can be seen , for instance , in the classical paper by miller and modigliani ( @xcite ) for the deterministic case and more recently in sethi , derzko and lehoczky ( @xcite , @xcite ) and sethi ( @xcite ) for the stochastic case .",
    "in this paper we consider this optimization problem in the classical cramr  lundberg setting , but we allow the management the possibility of controlling the stream of dividend pay - outs and of investing part of the surplus in a black and scholes financial market .",
    "we impose a borrowing constraint : short - selling of stocks or to borrow money to buy stocks is not allowed . technically , the unconstrained optimization problem is simpler .",
    "azcue and muler ( @xcite ) consider the problem of maximizing the cumulative expected discounted dividend pay - outs of an insurance company when the management has the possibility of controlling the risk exposure by reinsurance . in this case , the optimal value function was characterized as the smallest viscosity solution of the first - order integro - differential hamilton ",
    "bellman equation , and the optimal dividend payment strategy was found .    in this paper , the optimization problem is more complex than the one we treated before .",
    "one difference is that the associated hamilton  jacobi  bellman equation is a nonlinear degenerate second - order integro - differential equation subject to a differential constraint .",
    "the possibility that the ellipticity of the second - order operator involved in this equation can degenerate at any point together with the fact that there is an integral term , makes it more difficult to prove the existence and regularity of solutions .",
    "however , when we obtain the solution of this operator in section  [ sec6 ] , we see that the ellipticity only degenerates at zero and so the degeneracy is not as serious as it could be ( the solution turns out to be twice continuous differentiable ) .",
    "another difference is that , since in this case the controlled surplus involves a brownian motion , there is not an optimal strategy .",
    "nevertheless , we prove that the optimal value function can be written explicitly as a limit of value functions of strategies .",
    "so , we introduce the notion of limit dividend strategies and prove that the optimal limit strategy has a _",
    "band structure_.    in a diffusion setting , which means that the surplus is modeled as a brownian motion , different cases were studied ; we can mention , for instance , asmussen and taksar ( @xcite ) for the problem of dividend optimization and hjgaard and taksar ( @xcite ) for the case of dividend , reinsurance and portfolio optimization .",
    "the main difference between the two settings is that the hjb equation in the diffusion case is a differential equation and not an integro - differential one .",
    "other differences are that in the diffusion setting the optimal strategies are always barrier strategies , that there is a natural boundary condition at zero for the associated hjb equation and that this equation has always classical concave solutions ; these properties might not occur in the cramr  lundberg setting .",
    "avram , palmowski and pistorius ( @xcite ) study the problem of maximizing the discounted dividend pay - outs when the uncontrolled surplus of the company follows a general spectrally negative lvy process in absence of investment .",
    "the hjb equation associated with this optimization problem is also a second - order integro - differential equation but its ellipticity does not degenerate .    in both , hjgaard and taksar ( @xcite ) and avram , palmowski and pistorius ( @xcite )",
    ", the corresponding hjb equations are second - order equations whose ellipticity does not degenerate at zero , so to characterize the optimal value function among the solutions of the hjb equation they use the natural boundary condition at zero . in this paper",
    ", we do not have a natural condition at zero but we do not need this boundary condition because the ellipticity of the hjb degenerates at this point .",
    "the lack of a boundary condition at zero makes more difficult to obtain a numerical scheme .",
    "the main results of this paper are the following :    in the first part of the paper , we obtain the optimal value function as the smallest viscosity solutions of the associated hjb equation , and we prove a verification theorem that allows us , since the optimal value function has not a natural boundary condition at zero , to recognize the optimal value function among the many viscosity solutions of the associated hjb equation .    from section [ sec6 ] on ,",
    "we assume that the claim - size distribution has a bounded density ; this allows us to show that the optimal value function is twice continuously differentiable except possibly for some points .",
    "we find the optimal value function for small surpluses , and we prove that the optimal strategy is _ stationary _ , that is , the decision of what proportion of the surplus is invested in the risky asset , and how much to pay out as dividends at any time depends only on the current surplus .",
    "we also prove that the optimal dividend payment policy has a band structure .",
    "in particular , the optimal dividend payment policy for large surpluses is to pay out immediately the surplus exceeding certain level as dividends .",
    "we also obtain the best barrier strategy and show both an example where the optimal dividend payment policy is barrier as well as an example where it is not .",
    "the second example shows that , even for claim - size distributions with bounded density , the optimal value function could be neither concave nor twice continuously differentiable .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    ", we state the optimization problem and prove some properties about the regularity and growth of the optimal value function . in section [ sec3 ] , we state the dynamic programming principle and show that the optimal value function is a viscosity solution of the hjb equation associated with the optimization problem . in section [ sec4 ] ,",
    "we prove the uniqueness of viscosity solutions of the hjb equation with a boundary condition at zero . in section [ sec5 ] , we prove that the optimal value function is the smallest supersolution of the hjb equation and give a verification theorem that states that a supersolution which can be obtained as a limit of value functions of admissible strategies is the optimal value function . in section [ sec6 ] , we construct via a fixed - point operator a classical solution of the second - order integro - differential equation involved in the hjb equation . in section [ sec7 ] ,",
    "we use the solution obtained in section [ sec6 ] to obtain the value function of the optimal barrier strategy . in section [ sec8 ] , we find the optimal value function for small surpluses , show that the optimal strategy is stationary and prove that the optimal dividend payment policy has a band structure . in section [ sec9 ] , we show some numerical examples . we have placed some technical lemmas in the to improve the readability of the main text .",
