    "the nicmos observations were made with camera  2 which has a nominal plate scale of @xmath11 per pixel .",

    "the continuum subtraction was performed interactively using idp3 .",
    "since the continuum image is taken with a much wider filter , and at a central wavelength not immediately adjacent to the narrow band filter , they needed to be scaled prior to subtraction . in idp3 ,",

    "the optical images unfortunately do not cover the entire hh 7/11 outflow ; the brightest hh 7 object is partially missing at edge of one of the detectors .",
    "the lack of reference stars between the frames , implies that the detailed comparison relies on the accuracy of the coordinates systems adopted by nicmos and wfpc2 .",

    "a summary of the observations is in table 1 .",
    "before comparing the high resolution images from hst , let s briefly revise what is observed from the ground to emphasize the differences and similarities between the emission of the atomic gas and the warm molecular hydrogen , in particular because the wfpc2 images do not cover the entire object . in figure [ f1 ] , we compare two images of hh 7/11 placed on the same scale , one taken in [ ] 6717/31   ( from noriega - crespo & garnavich  @xcite ) , and other taken in h@xmath0 at 2.121@xmath1 m . the h@xmath0 image was obtained with the fred l. whipple ( flwo ) 1.2 m telescope and the ads sbrc camera in 1997 on october 10 , with an angular resolution of @xmath12  ( p. garnavich , private communication ) .",
    "there are h@xmath0 images at 2.12@xmath1 m  of hh 7/11 obtained with higher angular resolution , @xmath13 ( see chrysostomou et al .",
    "@xcite for details ) which show an even more clear view of the outflow . from figure [ f1 ]",
    "we notice , ( i ) the different structure of hh 7 , the leading _ working surface _ ( ws ) of the jet , which at optical wavelengths shows two well separated regions that have been identified with the bowshock and the mach disk ; ( ii ) the absence of a compact counterpart in h@xmath0 to the optical hh 11 knot ; and ( iii ) that despite these differences there is a ` one to one ' correlation between the main `` knots '' in [ ] and h@xmath0 .",
    "the high angular resolution nicmos 2.12@xmath1 m  continuum subtracted image and a comparison of the h@xmath0 emission with that of h@xmath2  and [ ] from the wfpc2 camera , are displayed in figure [ f2ab ] .",
    "these images show that , in detail , the atomic and nir h@xmath0 gases have more complex morphologies than those that can be described in terms of simple `` bullets '' or `` knots '' .",
    "the gross properties of the emission from both gases have been discussed in some detail by hartigan , curiel and raymond ( 1989 ) , and so we will concentrate on two of the most interesting and relatively new features : the h@xmath0 jet in svs 13 and the hh 7 ws .",
    "an enlargement of the nicmos image around the svs 13 source shows ( figure [ f3 ] ) the presence of highly collimated and resolved h@xmath0 emission , with a relatively high flux density that we identified with a small jet .",
    "the brightest component of the jet has 1.24  in length at pa = 163  ( although fainter emission extends up to 2.4 ) .",
    "the nicmos image therefore resolves and confirms that the 2.6 asymmetric feature arising se of svs 13 , detected in recent h@xmath0 fabry - perot ( f - p ) observations by davis et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , corresponds indeed to a small - scale jet . at a distance of 350pc ,",
    "the jet has a length of 430 au , making it one of the smallest h@xmath0 jets known .",
    "the subtracted psf svs 13 image has a small  bump  in the north aligned with the jet and could be tracing the counter - jet .",
    "the jet itself is narrower close to the source with an aspect ratio of @xmath14 , and becomes wider at @xmath8 0.64 ( 222 au ) from svs 13 .",
    "considering that we are looking at this outflow in projection , at approximately 30  with respect the plane of the sky ( herbig & jones  @xcite ) , the structure of this jet is remarkably similar to that of dg tau , the best example of an _ optical _ micro - jet ( solf & bhm  @xcite ; kepner et al .",
    "@xcite ; lavalley et al .",
    "@xcite ; lavalley - fouquet , cabrit & dougados  @xcite ; dougados et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the presence of an h@xmath0 jet is consistent with other molecular tracers of high velocity gas .",
    "for example , high - sensitivity interferometric co j=2 - 1 observations show already a `` bridge '' of gas between svs 13 and the rest of the outflow , including a jet - like feature in the ` extremely - high - velocity ' ( ehv ) gas near the source ( bachiller et al .",
    "the co j=2 - 1 gas has a peak radial velocity of @xmath15 km  @xmath4 , similar to that of @xmath16 km  @xmath4  observed in [ s  ii ] 6717/31 in hh 11 , the nearest knot to svs 13 ( solf & bhm  @xcite ) .",
    "and finally , high spectroscopic resolution observations at 2.12@xmath1 m  by davis et al .",
    "( 2001 ) clearly show two velocity components in the h@xmath0 gas within 1  of the source , with a blueshifted high velocity component of @xmath8 100 km  @xmath4 .",
    "one of the interesting things about this jet is that if one assumes a flow velocity of 200 km  @xmath4  for hh 7/11 , consistent with the velocity derived from the optical proper motions ( noriega - crespo & garnavich @xcite ) , these parameters set a kinematical age of @xmath3 years .",
    "svs 13 became an optically visible source during its last outburst in 1988 - 90 ( eislffel et al .",
    "@xcite ; liseau , lorenzetti & molinari  @xcite ) , almost 10 years ago , and so is quite possible that the observed jet is the result of such energetic event .    we can compare the h@xmath0 2.12@xmath1 m  emission of the bowshock , mach disk and jet , to have a idea of the _ relative _ physical conditions in these regions .",
    "for example , the jet flux density @xmath17 erg s@xmath18 @xmath19 arcsec@xmath20 , is three times higher than that of the bowshock , @xmath21 erg s@xmath18 @xmath19 arcsec@xmath20 , and ten times higher than that of mach disk , @xmath22 erg s@xmath18 @xmath19 arcsec@xmath20 .",
    "we can interpret these flux density ratios using the recent spectroscopic results obtained in the far infrared ( fir ) with the infrared space observatory ( iso ) and molecular shock models ( molinari et al .",
    "@xcite ) . hh 7 ws and svs 13 have similar intensities in the ( 0 - 0 ) s(1)-s(7 ) h@xmath0 pure rotational lines , as well as in other shock indicators like [ ] 12.8@xmath1 m  and [ ] 34.8@xmath1 m , which suggests that a 20 - 30 km  @xmath4  molecular c - shock can explain the nir and fir h@xmath0 emission in both objects ( molinari et al .",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand , molecular shock models at 20 - 30 km  @xmath4  for hydrogen densities in the range of @xmath23 @xmath6  predict that the line intensity of the 2.12@xmath1 m  line is @xmath24 times stronger in the high density models ( kaufman & neufeld  @xcite ) .",
    "so to satisfy both iso observations and theoretical models : ( i ) the observed flux density ratio @xmath25 requires a higher density for the jet , i.e. that the molecular jet is quite dense after leaving svs 13 , with a hydrogen gas density of @xmath26 @xmath6  ( molinari et al .",
    "@xcite ) ; and ( ii ) the bowshock is more dense ( @xmath27 @xmath6  ) than the mach disk .",
    "the presence of an h@xmath0 jet ejected from this pre - main sequence source of such small angular scale , explicitly shows that contamination by an outflow in the search for h@xmath0 disk systems around young stars is possible , although perhaps not as persistent as these systems become older .",
    "for example , the h@xmath0 ( 0 - 0 ) s(1 ) line flux around svs 13 is @xmath28 erg s@xmath18 @xmath19 , i.e. 5 - 10 times higher than those found in the t tauri and debris - disk samples of thi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , but certainly comparable to the values detected in their herbig ae sample .",
    "hh 7 is the leading working surface of the hh 7/11 jet and is perhaps the most characteristic feature of the outflow .",
    "an enlargement of the groundbased observations in figure [ f4 ] shows that the h@xmath0 emission spatially coexists with that from the atomic gas in both the arc - like bowshock and its mach disk .",
    "figure [ f4 ] also displays the nicmos and wfpc2 observations of the same region , unfortunately the hst optical images are vignetted , one of the reason why they have not been published before , and so the emission corresponding to the bowshock is missing .",
    "the bowshock and mach disk are separated by @xmath29  ( 1138.5 au ) with peak intensities in h@xmath0 at @xmath30 , @xmath31 = 311525.5   and @xmath32 , @xmath31 = 311524.2 , respectively .",
    "the h@xmath0 bowshock is large ( @xmath8 6 ) and subtends a relatively smooth and complete arc of @xmath33 .",
    "the fact that this shell is not fragmented suggests the presence of a sizeable magnetic field .",
    "theoretical arguments and numerical simulations have shown that a magnetic field can modify the morphology of a jet ( e.g. frank et al .",
    "@xcite ; stone & hardee  @xcite ) , and that a compressed magnetic field stabilizes a dense gas shell against rayleigh - taylor instabilities if @xmath34 g ( e.g. blondin , fryxell & knigl  @xcite ) . in our case , if the initial magnetic field is given by @xmath35 g , where the preshock density , is @xmath36 @xmath6 , as deduced from the h@xmath0 emission , then @xmath37 @xmath1 g . therefore even a slow shock of @xmath38 = 20 km  @xmath4  ( consistent with the h@xmath0 emission ) can compress the magnetic field by a factor 15 ( @xmath39[km  @xmath4 ] , mckee & hollenbach  @xcite ) , i.  e. enough to meet the stability criteria .    in the nicmos images the h@xmath0 emission at the mach disk is relatively faint ( see figure [ f4 ] ) . the high - resolution h@xmath0 groundbased observations by chrysostomou et al .",
    "( 2000 ) show a more clear picture of this feature .",
    "the presence of a mach disk in h@xmath0 is perhaps more convincing if one uses , for instance , the kinematical information available from f - p observations . at optical and nir wavelengths ,",
    "is possible to distinguish two distinct kinematical components corresponding to the bowshock and the mach disk separated by @xmath8 3  - 4   ( stapelfeldt  @xcite ; carr  @xcite ; davies et al .",
    "@xcite , their fig .",
    "1 ) . the physical conditions at the mach disk can be estimated in relative terms by comparing its h@xmath0 emission to that of the bowshock .",
    "the flux density ratio between the bowshock and mach disk is 3.5 , and this could be due to a slight difference in density and/or shock velocity .",
    "proper motion measurements set an upper limit of 30 km  @xmath4  for the velocity of the mach disk ( noriega - crespo & garnavich  @xcite ) , which is very close to the predicted _ shock velocity _ of the entire working surface .",
    "this means that even a complete thermalization of the shock could not account for the observed ratio .",
    "if we assume similar pre - shock conditions for the bowshock and the mach disk , and knowing that mach disk velocity ( @xmath41 ) depends on the jet ( @xmath42 ) , bowshock ( @xmath43 ) and pre - shock medium ( @xmath44 ) velocities , i.  e. @xmath45 , then is likely that at the mach disk the shock velocity itself is less than 20 km  @xmath4 .",
    "the question is whether or not the h@xmath0 emission observed at the mach disk truly corresponds to that excited by a magnetic precursor ( c - shock ) or is the result of some other processes , like entrainment or a j - type shock .",
    "the detailed answer to this question requires a mhd numerical simulation that is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the complex interaction of the ion and electron fluids with a magnetic field , coupled with the limited grid resolution of most numerical simulations , could explain why an h@xmath0 jet shock or mach disk has not been seen in recent molecular jet models ( e.  g. raga et al .",
    "@xcite ; suttner et al .",
    "@xcite ) ) .    one can ask , however , if the conditions at the working surface are the necessary for the development of a magnetic precursor , capable to excite the h@xmath0 in the mach disk .",
    "let s assume first a 200 km  @xmath4  jet flow that generates shock velocities @xmath46 km  @xmath4 . in the most simple scenario ( without dust grains )",
    "a magnetic precursor needs molecular gas with a low ionization fraction and a moderate magnetic field ( draine & mckee  @xcite ) . at the working surface ,",
    "the bowshock is the first shock that interacts with the surrounding gas , and although a magnetic precursor can excite the gas ahead of the shock , eventually ( for shock velocities of @xmath47 km  @xmath4 ) the h@xmath0 molecules will be dissociated ( smith  @xcite ; smith & mclow  @xcite ) , except at the `` wings '' of the bowshock , where the shocks are oblique and the molecular gas is only excited ( smith  @xcite ; davis et al .",
    "the emission of the atomic species , e.g. h@xmath2  and [ ] , in the hh7 ws indicates that the postshock gas is partially ionized and warm , and not ideal for a magnetic precursor , as the jet shock encounters this material",
    ". the exception could be again at the bowshock wings where the gas recombines more rapidly .",
    "this region is indeed where we detect the ` strongest ' h@xmath0 emission at the position of the optical mach disk .",
    "let s consider now a lower velocity flow such that the shock velocity is @xmath48 km  @xmath4 .",
    "in this case we can refer to recent results from lim , rawling & williams ( 2001 ) , where their adaptive grid 2d hydro - code incorporates the chemistry of 102 species , including those for molecules such as h@xmath0o or h@xmath0 . in their three models ( a - c ) , for different jet / environment density ratios , a h@xmath0 jet shock is created .",
    "for example in their model c , with @xmath49 @xmath6  and @xmath50 @xmath6 , the highest h@xmath0 density occurs at the mach disk ( lim , rawling & williams  @xcite ; their figure 6 ) .",
    "the above scenarios for the h@xmath0 emission at the mach disk suggest either a fine tuning of the physical conditions of the postshock gas at the working surface to drive a magnetic precursor , or the need to incorporate in the hydrodynamics the entire chemistry network .",
    "perhaps a more straightforward explanation is that a fraction of the h@xmath0 gas has been entrained by the jet in its interaction with the molecular ambient medium .",
    "this scenario has been recently explored by raga et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , where an atomic jet collides sideways with a molecular h@xmath0 cloud ( see their fig 1 ) , and as the jet `` bounces '' from the cloud entrains some of the molecular gas . in practice , there is not need of such strong interaction and is enough for the jet to strike some dense molecular gas along its path , as has been suggested previously for this system ( see e.  g. knee & sandell   @xcite ; sandell & knee  @xcite ) .",
    "we have described in the previous two sections what we consider the most outstanding features observed with the high angular resolution nicmos observations . in this section ,",
    "we describe briefly the main characteristics in of the other knots hh 8 - 11 in the h@xmath0 2.12@xmath1 m  and [ ] 6717/31 lines ( figure [ f5 ] ) .",
    "hh  8 . in the wfpc2 images this knot has a filamentary structure that spans @xmath8 7 , with a bright small core ( @xmath8 2 ) where both the h@xmath0 and atomic emission coincide , although with distinct morphologies ( figure [ f5 ] )",
    "kinematically , the knot follows the overall flow pattern defined by hh 7 and hh 11 ( herbig & jones  @xcite ; noriega - crespo & garnavich  @xcite ) , however , the h@xmath0 f - p observations show the molecular gas with a radial velocity of @xmath51 km  @xmath4  slower than the [ s  ii ] gas and with a component at zero and positive velocities ( carr  @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that the h@xmath0 emission could be either arising from behind the optical object , and is observed in projection ( as expected from a bowshock , with a weak shock component at its tail ) ; or could be the result of entrainment at the edge of the cavity created by the jet , but seen also in projection . in both situations ,",
    "the h@xmath0 gas would have a lower velocity than the atomic / ionic gas .",
    "this knot is not visible in the nicmos image , which is not a surprise given the short exposure and considering that even in groundbased observations is hard to detect ( e.  g. figure [ f1 ] ) . at optical wavelengths ,",
    "the wfpc2 images show a ` fuzzy ' knot of @xmath8 6  in size ; the knot has a [ ] /h@xmath2  ratio of @xmath52 indicating its low excitation ( table 2 ) .",
    "hh 9 has a very low radial velocity and essentially zero proper motion ( solf & bhm  @xcite ; noriega - crespo & garnavich  @xcite ) , so could be either part of the backflow of the jet envelope or an ambient medium condensation that has been excited by the outflow .",
    "hh 10 . already from the groundbased optical images was possible to infer a complex morphology for this `` knot '' ( figure [ f1 ] ) , but certainly not with the detail of the wfpc2 images .",
    "the morphology of the [ ] and h@xmath2  gas emission are quite similar in shape and span some @xmath8 14  in the n - s direction while the h@xmath0 emission , as in the case of hh 8 , is not as extended and well defined ( figure [ f5 ] ) .",
    "this object is one of the few condensations in the hh 7/11 chain , that at optical wavelengths , looks like a `` bullet '' .",
    "hh 11 is the fastest moving knot of the outflow , with a space velocity in the atomic / ionic gas of 190 km  @xmath4   ( noriega - crespo & garnavich  @xcite ) , and has the highest excitation in the flow ( with a [ ] /h@xmath2   ratio of @xmath53 ) , indicating shocks as strong as @xmath8 60 km  @xmath4 .",
    "situated at @xmath3  from svs 13 , this condensation was probably ejected @xmath54 yr ago .",
    "these properties reinforce the idea that we are witnessing a jet interacting with a moving medium set in motion by a previous ejection event ( raga et al .",
    "the observed h@xmath0 emission is located further back from the main object trailing behind the atomic / ionic gas ( defined by [ ] and h@xmath2  emission ) , as one expects from the most simple bowshock models which include h@xmath0 emission ( smith  @xcite ) .",
    "deep groundbased nir images at 2.12@xmath1 m  show a bit more extended emission in hh 11 , but still predominantly behind the optical counterpart ( e.  g. chrysostomou et al .",
    "therefore , hh 11 is most likely to be one of those rare cases where the h@xmath0 molecules are dissociated near the stagnation region of the bowshock , but they survive and are excited in those regions where the shocks become weaker ( oblique ) , i.e. at the bowshock wings ( smith  @xcite ) .",
    "svs13 ne . wfpc2 images in [ ] and h@xmath2  show a small condensation at approximately 5  ne of svs 13 , about @xmath55 in size ( figure [ f5 ] ) , that seems to trace the starting point of an arc - shaped structure north and parallel to the hh 7/11 outflow ( see figure [ f1 ] ) .",
    "presently , we do nt have any kinematical information on this knot .",
    "but the overall structure reminds us of another well known outflow in l1551 , where it has been suggested that the opening angle has changed as a function of time , going from a broad to a narrow configuration ( davis et al .",
    "@xcite their figure 9 ) , creating in the process a fan shaped cavity .",
    "we have resolved two remarkable features in the molecular hydrogen emission of the hh 7/11 outflow thanks to hst nicmos images at 2.12@xmath1 m : a jet with a length of 430 au arising from the svs 13 driving source , and the mach disk in hh 7 , leading working surface .",
    "these observations strongly support the presence of small - scale h@xmath0 jets arising from class i / o sources ( davis et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and open the possibility that a jet shock can be detected in h@xmath0 .",
    "using previously published infrared spectroscopic observations , coupled with molecular shock models , we have determined that : ( i ) the jet can have a density as high as @xmath5 @xmath6 , for shock velocities of 20 - 30 km  @xmath4 , ( ii ) the magnetic field plays a major role in stabilizing the hh 7 bowshock , ( iii ) the mach disk h@xmath0 emission is probably produced by shocks of less than 20 km  @xmath4 ; and ( iv ) the complex distribution of the atomic and molecular gases in hh 7/11 , depicted by the nicmos and wfpc2 images , coupled with its kinematics , suggests a strong interaction of this outflow with its circumstellar medium .",
