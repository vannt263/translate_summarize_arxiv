    "both simulations and theoretical studies have shown that bars are not vertically thin morphological features , but have a considerable vertical extent and a vertical structure , known as the boxy / peanut bulges ( hereafter b / p ; combes & sanders 1981 , combes et al .",
    "comparisons between observations and @xmath0-body simulations have established this direct connection firmer ( athanassoula 2005 and references therein ) .",
    "observations have shown that both bars and b / p bulges are quite predominant in disc galaxies and that the corresponding frequencies are in good agreement with the link between the two structures ( ltticke , dettmar & pohlen 2000 ) .",
    "we measure the peanut properties in a large sample of several hundred @xmath0-body simulations ran by one of us ( ea ) for different purposes .",
    "more information on these simulations and on their properties can be found in athanassoula & misiriotis ( 2002 ) and athanassoula ( 2003 , 2007 ) . in particular , we seek correlations between the properties of the bar and the properties of the b / p bulge .",
    "in order to measure the bar strength , we use standard fourier decomposition and take the amplitude of the second ( @xmath4 = 2 ) component .    @xmath5    where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the mass and azimuthal angle of particle @xmath8 . this can be done either globally or as a function of radius . in the former case the summation",
    "is carried out over all particles in the disc , while in the latter @xmath9 is the number of particles in a given cylindrical shell of radius @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the vertical asymmetry and the strength of the b / p can be measured in a similar way , by    @xmath12    where @xmath9 can be either the number of particles in the disc component , or the number of particles per vertical column or cut ( in which case @xmath13 ) and @xmath14 is the scale height of the initial exponential disc . in fig .",
    "1 we apply these two definitions to two simulation snapshots , one with a boxy bulge and the other with a peanut , or x - shaped bulge .",
    "we have also applied statistical methods , based on the distribution of the @xmath15 coordinates of the particles in a given vertical cut ( perpendicular to the equatorial plane ) of a snapshot seen edge - on , with the bar viewed side - on .",
    "we use the median of the absolute values and the standard deviation ( @xmath16 ) to measure the strength of the peanut , the kurtosis to measure its shape and the skewness and mean to measure the strength of the buckling event i.e. the asymmetry during the vertical instability .    our methods to calculate the strength of the b / p bulge",
    "correlate nicely ( fig .  2 , _",
    "right panels _ ) and can also be applied to real , highly inclined galaxies .",
    "even more interesting , we find correlations between the strength and shape of the b / p bulge with the strength of the bar ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "note in this figure how some simulations undergo several buckling events , as previously noted by martinez - valpuesta , shlosman & heller ( 2006 ) .",
    "we presented several methods to calculate the strength of the bar and the strength , shape and asymmetry of the b / p bulge and found strong correlations between their results .",
    "the most important correlation relates the strength of the bar with the strength of the b / p bulge , the strongest bars having the strongest peanuts .",
    "we also find that the strength of the peanut depends on the number of buckling episodes it underwent , the strongest bars having undergone more buckling episodes ( fig .",
    "3 ) . finally , we find a very interesting result about @xmath17 , i.e. about the shape of the radial density profiles along cuts perpendicular to the equatorial plane . for strong bars , having a strong peanut or x - shaped bulge ,",
    "this profile is more flat - topped , while for weaker bars , with more boxy - like bulges , it is more peaked .",
    "all the results summarized here are discussed in length by athanassoula & martinez - valpuesta ( 2008 , in preparation ) .",
