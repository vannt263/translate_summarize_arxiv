    "physical models of the broad emission line region ( belr ) of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) have been frustrated by the complexity of the expected emission mechanisms , and a poor understanding of the physical state , dynamics and spatial distribution of the line emitting gas .",
    "innovative new techniques , including reverberation mapping @xcite and microlensing @xcite , are providing indirect methods to measure the physical sizes of the emission regions . to date , each of these techniques has only been applied to a select sample of sources . however , useful models of the belr will require constraints on all physical parameters .",
    "broad emission line fluxes provide a powerful diagnostic of the physical conditions in the belr , particularly when coupled with photoionisation simulations from codes , such as .",
    "broad emission lines are a prominent feature in luminous agns , and a defining characteristic of quasars .",
    "these emission lines are typically broadened by gas velocities of @xmath310@xmath4 , and are understood to arise from gas close to the central black hole and its accretion disk .",
    "the broad emission line gas reprocesses a substantial amount of the light emitted from the central region .",
    "the emitted line fluxes , and in particular their ratios , are strongly dependent on the local physical conditions .",
    "the broad emission line region is the closest material that interacts strongly with the accretion disk that can be probed observationally , and a detailed physical understanding is essential in understanding the role of agn energy injection at larger scales .",
    "a compact broad emission line region has been inferred from reverberation mapping ( , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as a result of the small spatial scale of the belr and large distances to the nearest quasars , direct spatial imaging of the belr is not possible . in the absence of detailed structural information , we can develop photoionization models to predict spectral line ratios and infer the properties of the emitting gas .",
    "such calculations are particularly sensitive to the density and ionisation state of the gas  @xcite .",
    "this provides an alternative estimate of the physical scale of the belr .",
    "early belr photoionisation simulations were limited to single cloud models with a single number density , column density and ionisation parameter . simulating the entire range of possible belr parameter space was not possible , due to computational limitations .",
    "these simulations were reasonably successful in reproducing a number of observed emission line flux ratios @xcite .",
    "however , as more spectroscopic data became available , there was conflicting evidence : on one hand , the presence of semi - forbidden transitions , such as  1909 suggested reasonably low number density gas @xcite , while the hydrogen emission line ratios and strong  emission suggested the presence of high number density gas @xcite .",
    "broad emission line - continuum reverberation measurements find a wide range in emission line lags relative to the continuum variations and line widths , arguing for a distributed geometry of physical conditions ( , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to reconcile these conflicting observations , @xcite proposed a locally optimally emitting cloud ( loc ) model , where gas ` clouds ' with a range of physical properties exist at each radius in a spatially extended belr .",
    "this model takes advantage of large grids of photoionisation models that can now be simulated over a huge range of parameter space in the density - flux plane @xcite .",
    "the loc model has been successful in producing ultraviolet and optical emission line flux ratios that match observations @xcite , while maintaining consistency with reverberation mapping results @xcite .",
    "the loc also provides an explanation for the remarkably consistent belr flux ratios , over a very large range in agn luminosity .",
    "the name , ` loc ' originated because many of the optical and ultraviolet ( uv ) broad emission lines emit ` optimally ' in one region in parameter space .",
    "specifically , the typical emission line is efficiently emitted ( relative to the incident continuum ) over a relatively narrow region within the density - incident continuum flux plane ( see fig . 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "this natural selection effect is due to a combination of ionization potential , collisional de - excitation of the upper level , and thermalization at large optical depths .",
    "reverberation mapping measurements show that individual emission lines respond to variations in the continuum with different time delays , and the characteristic radius where each line is produced depends on the ionisation potential (  high ionisation lines are emitted closer to the continuum source ) .",
    "the term , ` loc , ' is less appropriate for the  and  lines , as the production of these lines from the continuum remains efficient over a large range of the density - flux plane @xcite .",
    "the hydrogen and helium lines are of particular interest because the physical processes governing their production is relatively simple , and there is a negligible dependence on several free parameters of the model : metallicity , column density and slope of the ionising continuum . despite the relative simplicity of the  emission spectrum ,",
    "some unexplained observations persist , such as the /  problem @xcite and the small scatter in measured balmer decrements ( / ) of agns with blue continua @xcite .",
    "the simple recombination spectrum predictions of case  b are invalid for several reasons under belr conditions .",
    "firstly , given the high gas number density , high incident flux environment , the optical depths in the balmer and paschen lines are finite and often large .",
    "secondly , the effects of collisions are expected to be very important , especially in light of the enhanced lifetime of the @xmath5 state due to the enormous  optical depths that are encountered .",
    "although the loc model has been shown to produce emission line flux ratios that are consistent with measured emission lines for optical and uv metal emission lines @xcite as well as helium emission lines @xcite , no comprehensive study of the infrared hydrogen lines has been undertaken .",
    "the near - infrared ( nir ) lines , for example the hydrogen paschen series , have the advantage of being affected by dust equally , whereas there is differential extinction across the optical and uv lines . with advances in infrared spectroscopy ,",
    "larger samples of both low luminosity agn @xcite and higher luminosity quasars @xcite are being observed .",
    "the paschen lines are becoming more widely used for agn measurements , such as black hole mass @xcite .",
    "this paper investigates a new diagnostic that tests the loc model using near - infrared hydrogen emission lines in quasars .",
    "the narrow component has a larger contribution to the total line flux in lower luminosity agns , and the systematic uncertainties resulting from this subtraction must be quantified .",
    "we have concentrated on quasars ( as opposed to seyferts and other lower - luminosity agn ) , so that deconvolution of the emission lines into broad and narrow components is not necessary .",
    "we use only spectra of individual objects , and demonstrate that composite spectra are not suitable for determining the physical conditions in quasars .",
    "section  [ section : models ] describes the photoionisation simulations and the simple loc model used in this analysis .",
    "section  [ sect : data ] describes data used .",

    "following the standard loc approach @xcite , a large grid of photoionisation models was computed using the photoionisation code , version 08.00 , last described by @xcite .",
    "version 08.00 of  implemented full resolution of quantum @xmath6-levels , is one of the numbers that describes the quantum state of an electron . ] for the h and he - like sequences for the first time @xcite , greatly improving the accuracy of the predicted emission . for greater predictive accuracy ,",

    "a brief outline of the grid simulations is given below .",
    "a more detailed description of the photoionisation simulations is given by @xcite .",
    "in the context of an loc model , the term , `` cloud '' refers to an individual emitting body of gas within the belr .",
    "emission line profiles are observed to be very smooth , implying either a large number of clouds @xcite , or a smoothing mechanism .",
    "micro - turbulence of @xmath3100  would broaden the local line profile sufficiently to smooth the bulk line profile to match the observed ( , as mentioned in @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "micro - turbulence also reproduces the observed uv  bump @xcite .",
    "the presence of a small amount of electron scattering @xcite or macro - turbulence in the cloud velocity field could also smooth the profile .",
    "the precise nature of the line - emitting entities is not the focus of this investigation .",
    "instead we focus on constraining general physical conditions of the emitting gas using hydrogen emission line flux ratios .",
    "models that predict hydrogen and helium emission line strengths were generated for a range of hydrogen number density ( @xmath7 ) and hydrogen ionizing flux ( @xmath8 ) values .",
    "the plane formed by these parameters represents the range of cloud densities and distances from the ionizing continuum that are expected to exist within the belr .",
    "the output emission of the photoionisation simulations is computed as an equivalent width in angstroms relative to the incident continuum at 1216(@xmath9 ) .",
    "the equivalent width is a useful description of the line emission , as it measures how efficiently the line is produced from the incident continuum .    for each point in the grid ,",
    "s standard agn ionising continuum ( similar to the @xcite continuum ) was used . despite a range in observed ionising continua ,",
    "the h and he emission lines are relatively insensitive to the shape of the ionising continuum , unlike the metal emission lines @xcite .",
    "a constant number density within each cloud was assumed and a constant column density of @xmath10@xmath11@xmath12@xmath13 was also assumed .",
    "although a range of column densities is expected within the belr , the hydrogen and helium emission lines are not very sensitive to the cloud column density in the range @xmath14@xmath15@xmath10(@xmath13)@xmath15@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "note that solar chemical abundances were used for all photoionisation simulations .",
    "the range of values for each of the physical parameters in the loc model is motivated by observations and physical considerations .",
    "broad , semi - forbidden  @xmath171909 is observed , implying the presence of @xmath3@xmath18  gas @xcite , as it is collisionally suppressed at higher densities .",
    "however , broad forbidden lines are not observed , indicating that the electron density in the belr is higher than the critical density of the forbidden lines .",
    "this gives a lower limit on the number density within the belr and only clouds with @xmath1910@xmath20  were considered . while none of the broad emission lines can be used to determine an upper limit on the number density , analyses of the balmer lines , whose ratios are sensitive to high density gas , and strong  emission indicate that high density ( @xmath310@xmath21 ) gas is also present within the belr ( , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "at these high densities , collisional excitation becomes important .",
    "the collisional excitation depends on density , temperature and ionisation state in a fundamentally different manner to the recombination case  b @xcite .",
    "therefore detailed photoionization simulations are required .",
    "reverberation mapping measurements show that broad emission lines originate at a range of radii from the central ionising source @xcite . at large distances from the continuum source ,",
    "the ionising flux is low and the temperature decreases . below temperatures of @xmath31500@xmath22k dust grains",
    "condense , making the line emissivity low @xcite .",
    "this temperature corresponds to a hydrogen ionising flux of @xmath8@xmath3@xmath23  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* after substituting a fiducial bolometric luminosity ) .",
    "the  and  emissivities are strongly dependent on the incident ionising flux , unlike most of the prominent metal lines @xcite .",
    "this is because the optical depth of the  and excited states increases with ionising flux @xcite , until the cloud is fully ionised .",
    "close to the ionising source , the hydrogen and helium atoms will be fully ionised and will not produce line emission . as the  and  line emissivity is low at large  values , the upper limit on @xmath8",
    "is considered to be unimportant .",
    "considering the limits discussed above , a large range in belr parameter space was simulated , spanning seven decades in both  and : @xmath24@xmath25@xmath26(@xmath27)@xmath2810@xmath29 and @xmath30@xmath31@xmath32(@xmath33s@xmath34)@xmath28@xmath16 , each stepped in 0.25 decade intervals .",

    "contour plots of each line , showing the  as a function of  and  will be presented in @xcite",
    ". a lower limit on the ionisation parameter , @xmath35 was also considered .",
    "this is motivated by observations of the calcium infrared triplet ,  8498 , 8542 , 8662 .",
    "if clouds with very low values of the ionisation parameter ( @xmath36 ) existed in the belr , stronger  @xcite and  5895 emission would be observed ( see * ? ? ? * for a range of  distributions in the density - flux plane ) . in addition , the emission would be totally dominated by resonance transitions clustered near 2400  and 2600  @xcite , which is dissimilar to the pseudo - continuum observed .",
    "a physical interpretation of the lower limit on the ionisation parameter ,  is that very dense clouds are not found far from the ionising continuum .",
    "although this limit may not exactly represent the true physical cloud distribution , it is a convenient representation in the loc model .",
    "these considerations provide only weak constraints on the upper  limit , and lower  and @xmath37 limits in the belr . however , they are very important because of the large emissivity of  and  close to these limits .",
    "the  and  line ratios are particularly sensitive to the lower  and upper  values (  and , respectively ) .",
    "thus rather than using fiducial values , a range of upper and lower limits on  and  was considered .      following the standard loc prescription ,",
    "the flux from each point in the simulated parameter space was summed to calculate the emission from each species of interest .",
    "as shown by @xcite , the line luminosity is given by : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the equivalent width of a particular line ( relative to the continuum at 1216 ) from a single cloud at radius @xmath40 , with number density @xmath7 .",
    "the cloud covering fractions as functions of radius and number density are given by @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",

    "the line luminosity can then be simplified to : @xmath45 where the integration limits are free parameters of the model and @xmath46 .",
    "this is simply a sum over each point in parameter space between the integration limits , since the simulated photoionized clouds in the logarithmic grid are weighted evenly per decade .",
    "we note that this weighting scheme maximizes the distribution of cloud characteristics in gas density and incident ionizing flux  a key characteristic of the loc model .",
    "power law indices in the density and distance weighting functions @xmath47 which deviate substantially from -1 will take on characteristics of a model with a single gas density and ionizing continuum source distance , which tends to favor gas at smaller distances from the central continuum source . here , however , given the limited number of observational constraints ( discussed in section  [ sect : data ] )",

    "this sum ( equation  [ equation : loc ] ) then allows us to compute the predicted total equivalent width ( ) for each emission line , assuming full geometric coverage .",

    "they found only a small intrinsic scatter in the measured ratio .",
    "the small intrinsic scatter in the @xcite measurement suggests that the intrinsic balmer decrement could be relatively consistent between objects , and the observed variance is due to different amounts of dust along the line - of - sight within the host galaxy .",

    ". ratios of /  that are above 1.0 have also been measured in lower luminosity agn @xcite .    while it is possible that systematic effects cause objects with larger /ratios to be preferentially selected in our sample , a bias caused by the composite methodology is a more likely explanation .",
    "composite spectra are useful for describing generic properties of a sample and for identifying emission lines that are too weak to be observed in individual spectra .",
    "however , care must be taken in ascribing physical significance to individual features of composite spectra .",
    "it is not clear whether composite spectra are useful for investigating detailed physical properties of the line emitting gas .",
    "emission line ratios in the composite spectrum can also be affected by : poor signal - to - noise ratios of individual spectra , and wavelength ranges where there are few objects contributing to the final spectrum .",
    "see @xcite for a discussion of how emission line ratios are affected , and an alternative method for producing composite spectra .",
    "the nir spectroscopy was not simultaneous with the optical and uv measurements .",
    "as quasars are intrinsically variable , this will introduce a systematic uncertainty . even after continuum matching the line fluxes",
    "will alter , this effect is known as the intrinsic baldwin effect @xcite . there is often a considerable difference between  and  @xmath68 values .",

    "nir observations are from september 2003 to september 2004 and  observations are in 2003 ( and one in 2005 ) .",
    "fitting the emission lines with gaussians introduces another systematic uncertainty .",
    "@xcite point out that gaussians do not fit the broad wings well , however gaussians generally fit the bulk of the broad emission line flux , while requiring only a small number of free parameters .",
    "the estimated contribution from the narrow component is less than 5% . @xcite",
    "deconvolved the emission lines into both a broad and narrow component , and in each case the equivalent width of the narrow component is only a few percent of the broad component .  contamination was not considered .",
    "fitting the  contamination would introduce additional errors , given the low signal - to - noise of the data .",
    "fixing the lower limit on the ionisation parameter , @xmath37 is not ideal , however , the ratios considered are insensitive to @xmath84 and with only a few measured ratios , the model must be limited in complexity .",

    "single point solutions in the density - flux plane were not considered for reasons discussed in section  [ sect : param ] .",
    "since the balmer and paschen lines are optically thick , the geometry will affect the predicted emission .",
    "if the belr geometry is such that emission from the ` back ' of the clouds is not observed , the predicted emission line ratios will change @xcite .",
    "any broad emission line flux measurement is from a snap - shot in time .",
    "the ratios will vary with time as the continuum luminosity varies , and this will be dependent on the distribution of the gas  both in geometry and physical state . comparing measured flux ratios can be problematic if the source is highly variable and lines are formed at very different radii .",
    "the recombination lines are emitted relatively efficiently over a broad range of physical conditions , and their continuum reprocessing efficiencies are largely dependent on the incident flux , and therefore the distance from the ionising source , due to optical depths in the excited states @xcite .",
    "this manifests in different measured reverberation mapping signals and line profile variability @xcite .",
    "for example , not only do the balmer lines show different measured time lags , but the line responsivity is observed to decrease from line centre to line wing ( see * ? ? ? * for a discussion ) . this could be corrected for if the distribution of broad emission line gas could be determined using high quality spectral and temporal data in conjunction with photoionisation models @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated a new diagnostic for the density and ionisation state of the hydrogen broad line gas in quasars .",
    "the results should be seen as preliminary , being based on fairly low snr ( snr @xmath85 per pixel in the continuum ) data for a small number of objects .",
    "the technique is promising because the hydrogen line ratios depend strongly on the physical conditions , but weakly on metallicity , column density and slope of the ionising continuum .",
    "the ionising flux is a good measure of distance from the source , and the technique offers an alternative route to measuring the structure of the quasar central engine , in addition to the physical state of the broad line gas .    despite the simplicity of the model",
    ", broad nir hydrogen emission line ratios can be reproduced by an loc integration .",
    "all hydrogen ratios predicted , including the balmer decrement , were consistent with those observed .",
    "low incident ionising flux values ( @xmath1 ) are required to reproduce the observed hydrogen emission line ratios .",
