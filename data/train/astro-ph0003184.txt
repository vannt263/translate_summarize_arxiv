    "the nucleus of m31 was first resolved by the stratoscope  ii balloon  borne telescope ( light , danielson , and schwarzschild  1974 ) , which showed that the peak brightness was displaced relative to the center , as inferred from the isophotes of the outer parts of the galaxy .",
    "this was confirmed , and extended by _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) observations , which revealed two peaks in the brightness , separated by @xmath3  ( lauer et al .",

    "spectroscopy , have probed the structure of the radial velocities and velocity dispersions , in increasing detail , along many strips across the nuclear region ( dressler and richstone  1988 , kormendy  1988 , bacon et al .",
    "1994 , van der marel et al .",

    "kormendy and bender  1999 ) .",
    "these provide evidence for the presence of a massive dark object ( mdo ) , which could be a supermassive black hole , of mass @xmath4 , located very close to the fainter peak ( p2 ) .",
    "the dynamical center of the nucleus is believed to coincide with the center of the isophotes of the bulge of m31 ; this point has been estimated to lie between the two peaks .",
    "tremaine  ( 1995 ) proposed that the nucleus could be a thick eccentric disk , composed of stars on nearly keplerian orbits around the mdo , with their apoapsides aligned in the direction toward the brighter peak ( p1 ) ; the brightness of p1 is then explained as the increased concentration of stars , resulting from their slow speeds near their apoapsides .",
    "he also showed that this model is broadly consistent with the kinematics , as inferred from the spectroscopic observations of kormendy  ( 1988 ) , and bacon et al .",
    "recent work has not only produced further support for tremaine s model ( statler et al .  1999 ,",
    "kormendy and bender  1999 ) , but has stimulated variations on the basic theme ( statler  1999 ) .",
    "tremaine also suggested that the alignment could be maintained by the self ",
    "gravity of the disk , wherein the eccentric distortion could arise as a discrete , nonlinear eigenmode , with some nonzero pattern speed ( @xmath5 ) , equal to the common apsidal precession rate .",
    "the dynamical question is yet to be resolved in a self  consistent manner , although explorations of orbits in model potentials have identified a family of resonant , aligned loop orbits , which could serve as building blocks ( sridhar and touma  1999 , statler  1999 ) ; reasonably faithful reproduction of the nuclear rotation curve adds some degree of confidence ( statler  1999 ) . if the nuclear disk is indeed a steadily rotating , nonlinear eigenmode , what is @xmath6 ?",
    "tremaine and weinberg  ( 1984 , hereafter tw ) invented a method of estimating the pattern speed of a barred disk galaxy , that uses measurements of the surface brightness , and radial velocity along a strip parallel to the line of nodes ( defined as the line of intersection of the disk and sky planes ) .",
    "that this methods works was proved when the pattern speed of the bar in ngc  936 was estimated by merrifield and kuijken  ( 1995 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the radial velocity measurements of the nucleus of m31 ( see references above on spectroscopy ) are available on strips that , either do not coincide with the line of nodes , or possess too poor an angular resolution for direct application of the tw method . in this letter , we show that the _ hst _ observations of statler et al .",
    "( 1999 , hereafter skcj ) , together with tremaine s ( 1995 ) model , can be used to estimate @xmath6 .",
    "we briefly recall tw s derivation of their kinematic method .",
    "let us assume that the disk is razor  thin , with a well  defined pattern speed , @xmath6 .",
    "the plane of the disk is assumed to be inclined at angle @xmath7 with respect to the plane of the sky .",
    "let @xmath8 , and @xmath9 be cartesian and polar coordinates , respectively , in the plane of the disk , with the origin coinciding with the center of mass of the system ( disk plus mdo ) .",
    "let the cartesian coordinates in the sky plane be @xmath10 ; the @xmath11 and @xmath12 axis coincide with the line of nodes .",
    "the disk is assumed to rotate steadily , hence the surface brightness of stars , @xmath13 .",
    "the surface brightness is also assumed to obey a continuity equation , without a source term .",
    "let @xmath14 be the ( mean ) velocity field in the disk plane .",
    "the continuity equation can be manipulated to yield , @xmath15 \\;=\\ ; 0\\ , ,   \\label{contin}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 .",
    "tw proceed by integrating equation  ( [ contin ] ) over @xmath11 from @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "assuming @xmath19 sufficiently rapidly as @xmath20 , and integrating over @xmath21 from @xmath21 to @xmath22 yields @xmath23 . noting that the sky brightness , @xmath24 , and the radial velocity , @xmath25 , the integrals may be expressed in terms of observable quantities ; hence @xmath5 can be estimated when @xmath26 has been measured on a strip parallel to the line of nodes .",
    "skcj measured @xmath26 along the p1p2 line , which is inclined by about @xmath27 , in the sky plane , to the line of nodes .",
    "therefore @xmath26 is available on a strip that makes an angle , @xmath28 , with the @xmath11axis , in the disk plane ; the tw procedure needs some modification , before @xmath5 can be extracted .",
    "let @xmath29 and @xmath30 be the rotated cartesian coordinates .",
    "let us also denote the surface brightness by @xmath31 .",
    "the skcj measurements are along the strip @xmath32 , that passes through the origin .",
    "equation  ( [ contin ] ) expresses a relation that is invariant under rotation of cartesian coordinates .",
    "hence application of the tw procedure provides an identical relationship between the integrals over the strip , defined by @xmath32 : @xmath33 we now express the integrals in terms of observable quantities : @xmath34 and @xmath35 can be used to eliminate @xmath36 , giving @xmath37 . as before , @xmath38",
    "however , the radial velocity , @xmath39 depends on @xmath40 as well as @xmath41 .",
    "hence it is , in general , not possible to express @xmath40 in equation  ( [ relation ] ) in terms of @xmath26 alone ( the tw method finesses this problem because @xmath42 kills the contribution to @xmath26 from the @xmath43 term ) .",
    "however , we are able to make progress by recalling the basic elements of tremaine s ( 1995 ) model . _",
    "if _ the nuclear disk is largely composed of nearly keplerian ellipses , with their apoapsides aligned along the p1p2 line , _ and _ we choose @xmath44 such that our strip lies along this line , then the strip intersects all these ellipses at right angles .",
    "thus @xmath45 , and we recover the familiar tw relation , @xmath46 it should be noted that the value of @xmath44 drops out of equation  ( [ twrelation ] ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath47 even when the apsides of the ellipses precess .",
    "below we use _ hst _ photometry and kinematics to estimate @xmath6 .",

    "figure  1 shows the ( sky ) surface brightness along the p1p2 line . the contribution from the bulge of m31",
    "was subtracted using two different fits to the bulge brightness , namely a nuker fit as described in tremaine  ( 1995 ) , and a srsic fit as described in kormendy and bender  ( 1999 ) .",
    "the disks so obtained will henceforth be referred to as a `` t  disk '' , and a `` kb  disk '' , respectively .",
    "skcj observed the stellar kinematics along the p1p2 line , using the @xmath48 long  slit spectrograph of the _ hst _ faint object camera .",
    "we obtained radial velocities along the p1p2 line , including the errors on them , from their `` de  zoomed '' rotation curve ( given in figure  3 , as well as table  1 of skcj ) ; these are displayed in figure  2a .",
    "the integrals in equation  ( [ twrelation ] ) need to be computed , with upper and lower limits symmetrically displaced about the center of mass of the disk plus mdo .",
    "kormendy and bender  ( 1999 ) have determined the center of mass to be displaced by @xmath49 from p2 toward p1 , and we use this value in the computations for figures  2b and 2c .",
    "the stated errors on the radial velocities were used by us to generate 300 random realizations . for each of these realizations of the rotation curve",
    ", we evaluate the integrals for five different limits , ranging from @xmath50 to @xmath51 .",
    "as is clear from equation  ( [ twrelation ] ) , only the combination , @xmath52 can be determined .",
    "it is a common assumption that the nuclear disk of m31 has the same inclination , to the sky plane , as the much larger galactic disk of m31 , which is inclined at @xmath53 .",
    "we wish to state our results independent of this assumption , so we present estimates of the quantity , @xmath54 , in figures  2b2d .",
    "figures  2b and 2c display the estimates of @xmath55 so obtained , together with @xmath56 error bars , as a function of the limits of the integrals , for the t  disk and kb  disk , respectively .",
    "it is evident that the estimates of pattern speed do not vary much when the limits of integration lie between @xmath57 and @xmath51 .",
    "we also explore the dependence on the position of the center of mass of the system , assumed in the computation of the integrals .",
    "although we used the most recent determination , due to kormendy and bender  ( 1999 ) , it must be noted that earlier work ( lauer et .",
    "1993 , king , stanford , and crane  1995 , tremaine  1995 ) records smaller values , @xmath58 , away from p2 toward p1 . figure  2d plots our estimates of @xmath55 , for a range of values of the center of mass , with limits of integration fixed at @xmath59 .",
    "a negative value of @xmath55 means that the pattern is _ prograde _ ; figures  2b2d indicate that this is the most likely possibility , with the absolute value increasing with the separation between p2 and the center of mass of the system .",
    "this is reasonable , because a larger separation corresponds to a larger disk mass , which implies a greater contribution from the self ",
    "gravity of the disk , which is ultimately responsible for the ( alignment and ) precession of the disk .",
    "the errors on @xmath55 are large , and a non rotating pattern can not be ruled out with certainty . below we",
    "quote representative bounds on the absolute value of the prograde pattern speed : @xmath60 for each realization of the rotation curve , the zero  crossing point ( the `` rotation center '' ) was determined by a third  order spline interpolation .",
    "we found the position of the rotation center to be displaced by @xmath61 , from p2 toward p1 .",
    "this should be compared with the value of @xmath62 , quoted by skcj .",
    "we also tested for any systematic dependence of @xmath5 on the position of the rotation center , and found none .",
    "our estimate of the pattern speed of the nuclear disk of m31 should be qualified by a discussion of possible sources of errors , most of which are difficult to estimate quantitatively .",
    "skcj calibrate velocities relative to an average over an @xmath63 aperture centered on the nucleus ( ho , filippenko , and sargent  1993 ) , and assure us that the errors are likely to be small .",
    "more significant , perhaps , are the systematic errors in @xmath26 , mentioned by skcj ; these are shown as open squares in figure  2a .",
    "skcj used a slit of width @xmath64 , and this will introduce contributions to @xmath26 from nonzero values of @xmath43 ( see equation  ( [ radvel ] ) ) .",
    "this effect is somewhat mitigated by cancellation between positive and negative values of @xmath43 , and the fact that the width of @xmath64 is of much smaller scale than the minor axis , projected onto the sky plane , of the smallest ellipse used by tremaine  ( 1995 ; see figure  2a of his paper ) to represent the nuclear disk .",
    "the limits of integration are necessarily finite in numerical computation , and we have resisted the temptation to include corrections by extrapolation of the @xmath65 and @xmath26 profiles .",
    "a basic assumption underlying the application of a tw  like method is that the surface brightness obeys a continuity equation , which would be valid for a stellar disk in the absence of star formation ( or death ) .",
    "we expect the numbers of stars to be conserved , except possibly in the vicinity of p2 , where the observed uv excess has been interpreted as contributions from early  type stars ( king , stanford and crane  1995 , lauer et al .",
    "1998 ) . however , these stars do not contribute much to the photometric and kinematic data we have used .",
    "tremaine  ( 1995 ) argues that two ",
    "body relaxation is expected to thicken the disk , whereas we assumed that the disk was razor  thin .",
    "the original tw method is applicable to thick disks , so long as the streaming velocity normal to the disk plane is zero .",
    "in addition to the assumption of zero normal streaming velocity , let us suppose that the three dimensional density , @xmath66 , is symmetric about the midplane of the disk .",
    "the contribution to @xmath26 from @xmath43 arise from an integral along the ( inclined ) line of sight that runs through the thick disk .",
    "consider two points along this line of sight that are equally displaced about the midplane of the disk .",
    "aligned , nearly keplerian orbits have flows such that @xmath66 is equal , whereas @xmath43 is equal and opposite at these two points ; in this ideal picture , there is pair  wise perfect cancellation , and no net contribution to @xmath26 from @xmath41 . in practice",
    "there should be some cancellation , because @xmath43 will have opposite signs at two corresponding points , but there could be a net contamination from the unequal values of @xmath67 and @xmath66 .",
    "tremaine s original model , which was a reasonable fit to the then available photometry and kinematics , considered a non rotating disk , and it would be appropriate to inquire about the implications of a non zero pattern speed . a pattern that is prograde with angular speed , say , of @xmath68 would contribute only about @xmath69 to the radial velocity at p1 , which is about @xmath70 , according to the measurements of skcj . the maximum radial velocity quoted by tremaine  ( 1995 ) is less than @xmath71 , so a non zero pattern speed could still be accomodated .",
    "our estimates do not rule out a non rotating disk , but we would like to offer a physical argument in support of a non zero pattern speed . for the disk plus mdo to be in a steady , non rotating state , the gravitational force on the mdo should necessarily vanish .",
    "our ( unpublished ) numerical computations indicate that the force is indeed non zero .",
    "a limitation of our method is that it uses , in an essential manner , the assumption that most of the contribution to @xmath26 comes from orbits which intersect the measurement strip at right angles . in comparison ,",
    "the original tw method does not rely on assumptions about the geometry of the mean flow ; averaging over several strips , all parallel to the line of nodes , will improve estimates of the pattern speed , as merrifield and kuijken  ( 1995 ) demonstrated .",
    "thus it is necessary to verify our estimates of @xmath5 , by using the tw method on future observations of @xmath26 , together with better photometry such as lauer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , along strips parallel to the line of nodes .",
    "an extremely useful set of observations that could be performed would be two  dimensional spectroscopy , similar to the work of bacon et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , with the increased angular resolution that should be available in the near future .",
