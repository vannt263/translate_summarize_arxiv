    "opal @xcite has measured @xmath2 the @xmath20 peak : @xmath21    one of the main motivations for the present study is to investigate whether measurements of the total longitudinal cross sections can yield a precise determination of the strong coupling .",
    "this requires that we control higher - order perturbative corrections and nonperturbative effects , both of which are expected to be much larger for @xmath2 than for the total cross section @xmath22 .",

    "the study of nonperturbative effects in fragmentation functions is an interesting topic in its own right @xcite .",
    "the light - cone expansions for fragmentation functions and for structure functions in dis are similar @xcite , and suggest that nonperturbative effects in both cases are of order @xmath23 and can be described in terms of multi - parton distributions .",
    "in contrast to dis , however , the relevant operator structures for fragmentation are essentially nonlocal and can not be expanded at small distances .",

    "moreover , the infrared renormalons encoded in the corresponding series can elucidate the power - behaviour of nonperturbative corrections and , perhaps , even their @xmath4-dependence , as in the case of @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath25 corrections can be traced by inserting a chain of fermion loops into the gluon propagator , and by restoring the full qcd @xmath27-function coefficient @xmath28 $ ] from the dependence on @xmath19 .",

    "taking into account higher - order perturbative corrections [ curve ( a ) ] steepens the energy dependence , such that it is not far from the jetset prediction , where the steep energy dependence is due to the hadronization correction .",
    "it is worth noting that the parton shower monte carlo alone does not yield this energy dependence .",
    "experience with similar calculations suggests that the approximation of resumming only @xmath25 contributions overestimates radiative corrections , so that we expect a more realistic estimate in between the curves ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "an exact @xmath69 calculation would reduce the theoretical error considerably .",
    "\\(iv ) in @xcite , universality of the @xmath6-power correction was assumed and a corresponding unique phenomenological parameter fitted from the difference between the measured average thrust @xmath70 and the theoretical second order prediction . when added to the second order result ( [ sigmal ] ) , one obtains a prediction for @xmath2 consistent with data .",
    "there is no conflict between the procedure of @xcite and the one presented here , if the phenomenological @xmath6 correction effectively parameterizes the higher - order perturbative contributions added in our approach .",
    "if universality of power corrections holds , these perturbative corrections would also be universal , at least asymptotically in large orders .",

    "note that the non - uniformity of the power expansion before integration over @xmath4 does not occur for deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) processes .",
