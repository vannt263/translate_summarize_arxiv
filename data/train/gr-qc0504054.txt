    "the current stage of theoretical cosmology and , in particularly , the dark energy problem calls to consideration of new field theory models which maybe useful for the explanation of the universe acceleration . in the situation",
    "when the attempts to use the well - known classes of field theories as candidates for dark energy ( dark matter ) are not quite successful , such strategy seems to be justified .",
    "moreover , one should bear in mind that number of problems of the early time cosmology ( say , the fundamental cosmological constant problem ) are still too far from the resolution . the ( old or new ) field theoretical model which should include also gravitation itself should solve these problems at once ( at least , in the regime where one can still neglect the quantum gravity effects ) .    in the recent paper @xcite the class of dark energy models where dark energy ( scalar or spinor field theory , etc ) couples with some power of the curvature has been proposed . it has been demonstrated on the example of scalar lagrangian coupled with the power of curvature that such modification of gravity - matter coupling term may explain not only the current cosmic speed - up , but also the dark energy dominance assisted by gravity . on the same time",
    ", theories of similar nature have been recently proposed as good candidate for dynamical resolution of the cosmological constant problem @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "of course , such models are not standard ones , in the sense that they are not multiplicatively renormalizable in curved spacetime @xcite .",
    "hence , they should be considered as kind of effective theories ( without clear understanding of their origin and their relation with more fundamental string / m - theory ) .    in the present paper",
    "we continue the study of the properties of such models on the example of scalar self - interacting theory non - linearly coupled with some power of the curvature . admitting the discrete symmetry which prohibits odd powers of scalar in the potential , the effective action formulation ( section 2 )",
    "is developed in close analogy with multiplicatively renormalizable theories @xcite . using riemann normal coordinate expansion ,",
    "the modified green function is evaluated at weak curvature limit ( section 3 ) .",
    "( we work in linear curvature approximation what is expected to be appropriate for the study of quantum effects in the inflationary universe and in late - time , dark energy universe ) .",
    "subsequently , this green function is used for the calculation of the one - loop effective action in the same limit ( section 4 ) .",
    "after the one - loop renormalization of the effective action done in section 5 , one arrives at finite expression which is used for the numerical study of the phase structure in frw universe .",
    "the number of examples explicitly demonstrates the behaviour of the effective potential for such effective theory . in",
    "particularly , it is shown the possibility of curvature - induced phase transitions in the model under discussion ( section 6 ) .",
    "it is indicated that radiative corrections are not very relevant at weak curvature .",
    "finally , in section 7 it is shown that scalar theory under consideration may serve also for dynamical resolution of cosmological constant problem .",
    "the explicit choice of parameters ( which maybe considered as kind of fine - tuning ) giving such dynamical resolution is presented .",
    "it is interesting that radiative corrections are not relative for such a mechanism .",
    "some discussion and outlook are given in the last section .",
    "we extend the @xmath1 theory which is the simplest model where the spontaneous symmetry breaking takes place .",
    "one of the possible couplings of scalar lagrangian with curvature ( at some power ) maybe included into the starting action : @xmath2 . \\label{a0}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is an arbitrary mass scale , @xmath4 is the determinant of the metric tensor @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the ordinary lagrangian density of the @xmath1 theory , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a real scalar field .",
    "our sign convention for the metric is @xmath9 and follows the notation of birrell and davies @xcite .",
    "if the spacetime curvature is constant , the non - linear curvature coupling disappears by the transformation @xmath10 we are interested in a non - trivial effect of the non - linear curvature coupling .",
