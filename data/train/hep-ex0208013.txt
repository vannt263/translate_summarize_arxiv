    "the sharp rise of the electromagnetic proton structure function , @xmath1 , toward low values of bjorken @xmath2 , discovered at hera  @xcite , and the observation of a large fraction of diffractive - like events  @xcite are attributed to a large gluon density in the proton at very low @xmath2 values , typically @xmath3 .",
    "the rise of @xmath1 with decreasing @xmath2 can be accommodated by the qcd , dglap evolution equations  @xcite in nlo down to momentum transfer squared @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that perturbative effects set in at relatively low values of the interaction scale .",
    "however , the validity of the dglap evolution equation is established through fits to data which involve many unknown parameters and therefore it may be doubtful .",
    "exclusive vector meson ( v ) production at high @xmath5 has been proposed as an alternative method to infer the gluon content of the proton  @xcite .",
    "high energy elastic v production in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) may be described , in the rest frame of the proton , by the fallowing sequence of happenings  @xcite .",
    "the incoming lepton emits a virtual photon , which subsequently fluctuates into a @xmath6 pair .",
    "the life time of such a quark pair fluctuation is long enough so that it is the pair that elastically scatters off the proton and evolves , long after the interaction , into a v state .    the character of the interaction of the @xmath6 pair with the proton depends on the transverse momenta of the pair .",
    "if the transverse momentum is large , the spatial transverse separation between the quarks is small and it forms a color dipole , whose interaction with the proton may be calculated perturbatively  @xcite .",
    "the leading process is two gluon exchange .",
    "if the transverse momentum is small , the color dipole is large and perturbative calculations do not apply . in this case",
    "the interaction looks similar to hadron - hadron elastic scattering and the process should proceed through pomeron exchange as expected from regge phenomenology  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 wave function of the virtual photon depends on the polarization of the virtual photon . for longitudinally polarized photons , small transverse size @xmath6 dominate .",
    "the opposite is true for transversely polarized photons .",
    "the attractive features of elastic v production is that , at high @xmath5 , the longitudinal component of the virtual photon dominates .",
    "the interaction cross section for the latter can be , in principle , fully calculated in perturbative qcd .",
    "moreover , for heavy vector mesons , like the @xmath7 or the @xmath8 , perturbative calculations apply even at @xmath9 , as the smallness of the dipole is guaranteed by the mass of the quarks .",
    "independently of particular calculations  @xcite , in the region dominated by perturbative qcd , the following features are predicted :    * the total @xmath10 cross section , @xmath11 , exhibits a steep rise with @xmath12 , the photon - proton center - of - mass energy , that can be parameterized as @xmath13 , with @xmath14 increasing with @xmath5 ; * the @xmath5 dependence , which for a longitudinally polarized photon is expected to behave like @xmath15 , becomes milder , more like @xmath16 , due to the sharp increase of the gluon density with @xmath5 ; * the distribution of @xmath17 , the four momentum transfer squared at the proton vertex , becomes universal , with little or no dependence on @xmath12 or @xmath5 ;    all these features have been observed at hera  @xcite in the exclusive production of @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath7 mesons . however , the agreement between measurements and theory is far from perfect .",
    "there are many factors that may spoil the agreement .",
    "first and foremost , the measured cross sections contain the possibly soft transverse component of the virtual photon , which has to be modeled .",
    "in addition , the perturbative calculations have the following uncertainties :    * the calculation of @xmath21 involves the so - called skewed parton distributions  @xcite , which are not yet well tested and involve gluon distributions outside the range which is constrained by global parton density analyses  @xcite ; * higher order corrections have not been fully calculated , therefore the overall normalization is uncertain and the scale at which the gluons are probed is not known ; * the fast rise of @xmath11 implies the presence of the real part of the scattering amplitude , which is not fully known ; * the wave functions of the vector mesons are not fully under control .    in spite of all these problems , it is generally felt that precise measurements of @xmath11 as a function of @xmath12 , @xmath5 , @xmath17 and the mass of the vector meson , @xmath22 , with a separation into longitudinal and transverse components  @xcite , will help to resolve the theoretical uncertainties and ultimately lead to a better understanding of the parton distributions in the proton as well as of the dynamics of high energy interactions in the presence of a large scale .",
    "one of the challenges in confronting perturbative qcd calculations with data is the ability to establish a region where hard interactions dominate over the soft component .",
    "the soft component is believed to be well described by regge phenomenology , according to which at high energy , the pomeron exchange dominates in the production of diffractive states .",
    "the parameters of the pomeron trajectory are known from measurements of total cross sections in hadron - hadron interactions and elastic proton - proton measurements .",
    "it is usually assumed that the pomeron trajectory is linear in @xmath17 and has the following form : @xmath23 the parameter @xmath24 determines the energy behavior of the total cross section , @xmath25 and @xmath26 describes the increase of the exponential slope @xmath27 of the @xmath17 distribution with increasing @xmath28 .",
    "the value of @xmath26 is expected to be inversely proportional to the typical transverse momenta squared of the partons participating in the exchanged trajectory  @xcite .",
    "indeed a large value of @xmath26 would suggest the presence of low transverse momenta , typical of soft interactions .",
    "the latest fits of @xmath24  @xcite and @xmath29  @xcite are give : @xmath30 these values for the trajectory parameters describe the so called soft pomeron trajectory .",
    "the non - universality of @xmath24 has been established in dis , where the slope of the rise of the @xmath31 total cross section with @xmath12 has a pronounced @xmath5 dependence  @xcite .",
    "the issue of the @xmath26 dependence on the hardness of the interaction may be addressed in the study of exclusive v production at hera .",
    "the value of @xmath26 may be determined from the @xmath12 dependence of @xmath27 , since @xmath27 is expected to behave as @xmath32 the parameter @xmath26 may also be derived from the @xmath12 dependence of the differential cross section @xmath33 at fixed @xmath17 , @xmath34 } \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath35 is a function of @xmath17 only .",
    "the latter approach has the advantage that no assumption needs to be made about the @xmath17 dependence .",
    "the measurements of @xmath36 in exclusive @xmath37 photoproduction show that , while @xmath24 for @xmath37 is larger the soft @xmath24 value , the value of @xmath26 for @xmath37 is smaller  @xcite than the soft value .",
    "another way to investigate the contribution of hard and soft components in v production is by projecting out the interactions induced by the longitudinally and transversely polarized virtual photons .",
    "due to the respective wave functions structure , small @xmath6 configurations are dominantly longitudinal while large configurations are dominantly transverse .",
    "if one assumes that exclusive v production proceeds through @xmath28-channel helicity conservation ( schc ) , the separation into the longitudinal and transverse components is possible . at small @xmath17 , the hypothesis of schc has been directly tested in the data , and small deviations have been observed  @xcite .",
    "however , the deviations are small enough not to jeopardize the decomposition of the cross sections into the longitudinal and transverse components .",
    "the angular distributions of the decay products of the vector mesons give access to the spin density matrix elements , which are bilinear combinations of the helicity amplitudes @xmath38 where @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) is the v ( virtual photon ) helicity  @xcite .",
    "as @xmath17 increases , a possible change in helicity is more likely due to the change in the v s direction and the transfer of the transverse momentum carried by the gluons .",
    "the following features are expected by pqcd models  @xcite in dis for @xmath41 :    * a constant ratio of the helicity conserving amplitudes , @xmath42 , with @xmath17 ; * a @xmath43 dependence for the ratio of the single helicity flip to the non - flip amplitudes @xmath44 and @xmath45 ; * a linear @xmath17 dependence for the ratio of the double flip to the non - flip amplitudes @xmath46 ; * the hierarchy @xmath47    the differential cross section , @xmath48 , of v production has an exponentially falling cross section at low @xmath17 and a power like behavior at high @xmath17 . an exponential behavior is associated with a gaussian charge distribution and the slope , @xmath27 , of the exponent is related to the width of the distribution and is a measure of the interaction size . in a naive picture for elastic scattering",

    ", @xmath27 should reach an asymptotic value equal to the proton size .",
    "the cross section for elastic v photo or electroproduction , with small transfer momentum to the proton , has the form  @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the form factors of the proton and the v , respectively , that account for the probabilities of their elastic production , and @xmath52 is the amplitude of the constituent interaction .",

    "the ratio of equation ( [ qq : ryskin1 ] ) to equation ( [ qq : ryskin2 ] ) is equal to the square of the proton form factor .",
    "the dependence of the cross section @xmath54 on the center of mass energy , @xmath12 , is shown in fig.[fig : w_php_allvm.ps ] for photoproduction of various vector mesons  @xcite .",
