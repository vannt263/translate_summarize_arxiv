    "one of the fundamental problems in physics is the quantization of gravity .",
    "a satisfactory solution to it has not been given yet .",
    "nevertheless , there are signs that the theory must imply discretization of some geometric quantities . for instance",
    ", it can be shown from heuristic arguments that the area of the event horizon of a black hole must have a discrete spectrum .",
    "the proof follows from ehrenfest principle @xcite , which states that to every classical adiabatic - invariant there corresponds a discrete spectrum in its quantum version .",
    "thus , as this area is proportional to the entropy of the black hole , which is a classical adiabatic - invariant , bekenstein proposed that it must have a discrete spectrum in the quantum level of the form @xcite @xmath0 with @xmath1 being a proportionality constant and @xmath2 the planck length .",
    "it can be seen that ( [ eq : hoyo ] ) is essentially the area of a sphere of radius @xmath3 . +",
    "it is expected that the correct version of quantum gravity be consistent with proposal ( [ eq : hoyo ] ) .",
    "that implies a space - time consistent with discretization of some geometric quantities in the level of quantum gravity . in this sense ,",
    "g. t hooft showed that in quantum gravity in @xmath4 dimensions a discrete space - time is obtained in an effective fashion @xcite .",
    "this result suggests that in other dimensions quantum gravity implies discrete spaces .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the discrete space obtained by g. t hooft is the so - called snyder space , which is interesting because it is discrete , noncommutative and compatible with the lorentz symmetry @xcite .",
    "in fact , based on it other lorentz - invariant discrete spaces can be constructed @xcite .",
    "a proposal to quantize gravity based on discrete spaces can be seen in @xcite .",
    "+ in this letter we show that , starting from the snyder space , the area of the disc and of the sphere can be quantized .",
    "we also show that the area spectrum of the sphere can be related to the bekenstein conjecture ( [ eq : hoyo ] ) .",
    "+ the manuscript is organized as follows : in section [ s : tss ] we study some properties of the snyder space .",
    "we then use these properties to calculate the area quantum : of the disc in section [ s : ad ] and of the sphere in section [ s : as ] .",
    "finally , in section [ s : summ ] we summarize our results .",
    "we shall express the snyder space in terms of the @xmath5 variables which are considered in a flat metric with signature @xmath6 . in this fashion ,",
    "the actual coordinates of the snyder space @xcite and their commutation rules are given by @xmath7&= & ia \\hat l^{\\mu\\nu } , \\label{eq : xmuxnu}\\\\ \\hat l^{\\mu\\nu } & = & -ia\\left(\\zeta^{\\nu } \\frac{\\partial } { \\partial \\zeta_{\\mu}}-\\zeta^{\\mu } \\frac{\\partial } { \\partial \\zeta_{\\nu}}\\right),\\\\ & & \\mu,\\nu=0,1,\\cdots , d.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is a constant with units of length and @xmath9 is a parameter invariant under the @xmath10 group @xcite . in particular , for the @xmath11 case , the commutation rules of the spatial variables can be represented by the matrix @xmath12 notice that the rows of this matrix satisfy the commutation rules @xmath13= ia\\epsilon_{ijk } c_{lk}. \\label{eq : cliclj}\\ ] ] that is , for every pair of spatial variables and their commutator the @xmath14 algebra holds , i.e. a noncommutative space of the type of the fuzzy sphere @xcite .",
    "+ it can be shown that @xmath15 is the generator of lorentz transformations in the snyder space @xcite .",
    "in fact , for the spatial part of the commutation rules , ( [ eq : xmuxnu ] ) can be written as @xmath16= ia\\epsilon_{ijk}\\hat l_{k } , \\quad \\hat l_{i}=-ia\\epsilon_{ijk}\\zeta^{j } \\frac{\\partial } { \\partial \\zeta^{k}},\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the generator of rotations which satisfies @xmath18&=&ia\\epsilon_{ijk}\\hat l_{k } , \\\\",
    "\\left[\\hat x_{i},\\hat l_{j}\\right]&=&ia\\epsilon_{ijk}\\hat x_{k}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by using @xmath17 and @xmath19 , one may define the operators @xmath20 which satisfy @xmath21&=&ia\\epsilon_{ijk}\\hat m_{k } , \\\\",
    "\\left[\\hat n_{i},\\hat n_{j}\\right]&=&ia\\epsilon_{ijk}\\hat n_{k},\\\\ \\left[\\hat n_{i},\\hat m_{j}\\right]&=&0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that is , the algebra of @xmath22 . in this sense",
    "the spatial sector of the snyder space can be regarded as a combination of two fuzzy spheres .",
    "to obtain this quantum we use the spatial part of the commutation rules ( [ eq : xmuxnu ] ) , which are equivalent to ( [ eq : cij ] ) .",
    "in particular , for the @xmath23-@xmath24 plane we define the operators @xmath25 where @xmath26 can be identified with the area operator of a disc . by using the fact that the rows of matrix ( [ eq : cij ] ) satisfy the @xmath14 algebra , eq .",
    "( [ eq : cliclj ] ) , one finds the spectra @xmath27|nm\\rangle,\\qquad \\\\   & \\hbox{for } & n=0,1,2,\\cdots\\ \\ \\hbox{and}\\ \\   -n\\leq m\\leq n , \\label{eq : aq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that the area of the disc , @xmath28 , is discrete .",
    "+ it can be shown that the uncertainty principle @xmath29|,\\ ] ] for this case becomes @xmath30\\geq \\frac{a^{2}}{2}|m|.\\ ] ] notice that the equality holds when @xmath31 , which is the case of the coherent states .",
    "thus , for the coherent states the area of the disc has spectrum @xmath32 we remark that , for a given @xmath33 , the uniformly spaced spectrum holds when @xmath34 reaches its largest value , which occurs when the area is a minimum .",
    "+ all the previous results hold equally for the @xmath23-@xmath35 and @xmath24-@xmath35 planes .",
    "another noncommutative space that allows to quantize the area of the disc can be seen in @xcite .",
    "to get this quantum let us recall that in minkowski space @xmath36 whereas in schwarzschild space @xmath37 so that the area of the sphere in each case is @xmath38 therefore , in principle , the spectrum of @xmath39 must be the same in either the minkowski or schwarzschild space .",
    "then , as quantizing @xmath39 is equivalent to quantizing @xmath40 , we use eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mi][eq : ni ] ) to find @xmath41 which can be combined to get @xmath42 by using the addition rule of two angular momenta one gets to the spectrum @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "notice that in the case @xmath46 and @xmath47 , one finds the spectrum @xmath48 which coincides with bekenstein conjecture ( [ eq : hoyo ] ) .",
    "comparison between spectra ( [ eq : abek ] ) and ( [ eq : hoyo ] ) suggests that the constant @xmath8 must be of the order of the planck length .",
    "+ analogously to the disc , for @xmath49 the uniformly spaced spectrum is obtained when @xmath50 is maximum ; that is when the area is a minimum .",
    "+ it should be pointed out that , starting from the snyder space , yang constructed a discrete space - time which , apart from being compatible with the lorentz symmetry , is also compatible with the poincare symmetry @xcite .",
    "the commutation rules in the spatial coordinates of the yang space coincide with those of the snyder space and so the results here presented are also valid for the yang space .",
    "+ the fact that the snyder space is compatible with bekenstein conjecture ( [ eq : hoyo ] ) reinforces the idea that in some limit quantum gravity in @xmath51 dimensions implies the snyder space .",
    "other works relating quantum gravity and noncommutative spaces can be seen in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the spatial sector of the snyder space can be regarded as an array of fuzzy spheres .",
    "in addition , the area quantum of the disc and of the sphere were obtained .",
    "it was also shown that an uniformly spaced spectrum may be obtained for the sphere which coincides with the bekenstein conjecture for the area of a black hole horizon .",
    "this last result reinforces the idea that in some limit quantum gravity in @xmath51 dimensions may imply the snyder space .",
