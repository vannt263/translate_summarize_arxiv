    "the recent discovery of superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 ( ref .  ) has attracted considerable interest in the study of this material , both to understand the mechanism of superconductivity and to explore other properties of mgb@xmath0 and related materials .",
    "the high transition temperature @xmath6 40 k in this material offers other possibility for finding high-@xmath1 superconductivity in some binary intermetallic compounds besides cuprates and @xmath7-based compounds .",
    "meanwhile , the high critical currents observed in mgb@xmath0 thin films @xcite and wires@xcite reveal that mgb@xmath0 belongs to a new class of low - cost , high - performance superconducting materials for magnets and electronic applications .",
    "measurements of the isotope effect and of the influence of pressure on the transition temperature and critical field of superconductors yield information on the interaction causing superconductivity . indeed , the pressure ( or volume ) and the mass number would seem to be the only variables whose effect might be capable of immediate theoretical interpretation . by observing how pressure changes the parameters of the lattice in the normal state and in the superconducting state , and comparing the measurements with the theoretical predictions , one can test the validity of some theoretical models . olsen @xmath8 @xmath9 @xcite have shown that the volume ( v ) dependence of effective interaction @xmath3 , @xmath10 , can be scaled well with the deviation @xmath11 from the full isotope effect where @xmath11 is defined by @xmath12 in superconducting metals .",
    "@xmath8 @xmath9 @xcite and hinks @xmath8 @xmath9 @xcite reported a sizeable isotope effect for b ( @xmath13=0.26(3 ) or 0.30(1 ) ) in newly discovered superconductor mgb@xmath0 . although the total isotope coefficient @xmath14=0.32(1 ) ( ref .  ) is smaller than the canonical bcs value of 0.5 , it is the same as that in cd ( ref .  ) . the isotope effect along with other measurements such as inelastic neutron scattering,@xcite tunneling,@xcite nmr ( ref .  ) , and specific heat@xcite confirmed that mgb@xmath0 is an electron - phonon mediated @xmath15-wave superconductor .    soon after the discovery of superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 , the effect of pressure on @xmath1 was studied by two groups@xcite by resistivity or @xmath16 susceptibility measurements .",
    "both groups observed a decrease of @xmath1 with increasing pressure , with initial pressure derivative @xmath17 of 0.8 k / gpa ( ref .  ) or 1.6 k / gpa ( ref .  ) , respectively .",
    "moreover , monteverde @xmath8 @xmath9 @xcite found that the superconductivity is not destroyed by applying high pressure up to 25 gpa , at which point @xmath1 is as high as 21 k. a somewhat larger @xmath17 of 2.0 k / gpa was late reported by saito @xmath8 @xmath9@xcite from high - pressure resistivity measurements . using a he - gas apparatus ,",
    "tomita @xmath8 @xmath9@xcite determined a @xmath17 of 1.11 k / gpa under pure hydrostatic pressure conditions . in order to find the reason why the reported values of @xmath17 are different among different groups , lorenz @xmath8 @xmath9 @xcite carried out high pressure experiments on mgb@xmath0 samples with different @xmath1 s at ambient pressure and different pressure media .",
    "@xmath1 was found to decrease linearly over the whole pressure range ( 01 gpa ) . in the he environment , the two samples with the initial @xmath1=39.2 and 37.4 k yield the pressure derivatives of 1.07 and 1.45 k / gpa , respectively .",
    "the former is obviously very close to that of tomita @xmath8 @xmath9@xcite the latter approaches their previous data,@xcite which was obtained by using the fluorinert fc77 as pressure medium .",
    "they therefore concluded that the variation in the value of @xmath17 by various groups results from the differences in sample preparation conditions .",
    "the value of @xmath181.1 k / gpa is then confirmed to give the true hydrostatic pressure dependence of @xmath1 in mgb@xmath0 .",
    "two theoretical models have been tried to describe the systematics of the behavior of @xmath1 under pressure in mgb@xmath0 .",
    "based on the theory of hole superconductivity , hirsch @xcite predicted an increased @xmath1 with the decrease of b - b intraplane distance under the application of in - plane biaxial pressure .",
    "however , this prediction has not been confirmed experimentally yet .",
    "no uniaxial pressure measurement was reported due to the extreme difficulty in growing mgb@xmath0 single crystal .",
    "the experiments of hydrostatic pressure effect on @xmath1 do not particularly support this theory provided that no charge transfer between the mg and b layers occurs .",
    "alternatively , the experimental results have been analyzed @xcite by using the mcmillan formula @xcite derived from eliashberg theory,@xcite supporting electron - phonon mediated superconductivity .",
    "interestingly , loa and syassen @xcite analyzed the pressure effect on @xmath1 from mcmillan formula on the basis of their calculated elastic and electronic structure data . assuming that the electron - ion matrix element @xmath19 is pressure independent",
    ", they found that the pressure effect on @xmath1 is in good agreement with experimental data by using a lattice grneisen parameter @xmath20=1 .",
    "these assumptions , however , deserve some refinements .",
    "recent band structure calculations suggest that mgb@xmath0 is a traditional @xmath21 metal superconductor.@xcite the pressure dependence of @xmath19 has long been an interesting issue of the research of pressure effect in simple @xmath21 metals.@xcite ziman s calculation of the electron - phonon interaction leads to @xmath22 at least in the limit of long wavelengths.@xcite this then indicated that the consideration of the pressure dependence of @xmath19 would be important for better understanding the superconducting properties of mgb@xmath0 under pressure . on the other hand , it has been found@xcite that the choice of lattice grneisen parameter @xmath20 is crucially important in explaining both the magnitude and the sign of the pressure derivative of @xmath1 when using mcmillan formula .",
    "the value of @xmath20=1 in the calculation of loa and syassen is obviously lower than those reported recently.@xcite the pressure dependence of the effective electron - electron coulomb repulsion @xmath23 appearing in the mcmillan formula is usually neglected in previous studies due to the assumption of the small change of @xmath23 compared with that of the electron - phonon coupling parameter @xmath24 ( ref .  ) .",
    "however , the magnitude of @xmath23 is also of interest in connection with the possibility that superconductivity may be destroyed by pressure.@xcite it was argued that the pressure dependence of @xmath23 makes a significant contribution to the behavior of @xmath1 under very high pressures and must be handled carefully.@xcite    in this paper we discuss the pressure dependences of some interested superconducting properties in mgb@xmath0 .",

    "all these characteristic pressure behaviors allow us to conclude that mgb@xmath0 should be a simple electron - phonon mediated @xmath21 superconductor and the mechanism in simple @xmath21 metals superconductors is also responsible for the superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 .",
