    "the launch of the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( rxte ) has allowed for the discovery of fast quasi - periodic variability from many rapidly accreting ( @xmath10 ) neutron stars .",
    "these observations strongly suggest that these neutron stars ( nss ) are rapidly rotating , as predicted by those scenarios connecting the millisecond radio pulsars to this accreting population ( see bhattacharya 1995 for an overview ) .",
    "strohmayer et al . (",
    "1996 ) were the first to detect nearly coherent @xmath11 hz oscillations during type i x - ray bursts from the low accretion rate ( @xmath12 ) ns 4u  1728 - 34 .",
    "pulsations were detected in six of the eight bursts analyzed at that time .",
    "in addition , two high frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) were seen in the persistent emission .",
    "these changed with accretion rate , but maintained a fixed difference frequency of @xmath13 hz , identical to the period seen during the bursts .",
    "the detection of two drifting qpo s ( in the persistent emission ) separated by a fixed frequency identical to that seen in the bursts naturally leads to beat frequency models ( strohmayer et al .",
    "1996 ; miller , lamb , & psaltis 1998 ) .",
    "the difference frequency is presumed to be the ns spin frequency , @xmath3 , whereas the upper frequency has different origins in different models ( see van der klis 1998 for a summary ) .",
    "in addition , the temporal behavior of the periodic oscillations both during the rise of the bursts ( strohmayer , zhang , & swank 1997b ) and in the cooling tails ( strohmayer et al .",
    "1997a ) are most easily explained in terms of rotation .",
    "there are six nss with measured periodicities during type i x - ray bursts ( see table 1 ) .",
    "both the difference frequencies ( @xmath14 ) and the burst frequencies ( @xmath15 ) are in a narrow range , from 260 to 589 hz . for two objects ( ks 1731 - 260 and 4u 1636 - 53 ) the difference frequencies are one - half the burst values . which value is @xmath3 is not resolved .",
    "there are also many nss that accrete at higher rates and are not regular type i x - ray bursters .",
    "many of these objects , notably the `` z '' sources , also show drifting qpo s at fixed separation , again with a similarly narrow frequency range ( roughly 250 - 350 hz ) .",
    "beat - frequency like models are also applied to these observations so as to infer @xmath3 .",
    "the applicability of such a model is less clear when the difference frequency is not constant ( sco x-1 , van der klis et al .",
    "1997 ; 4u 1608 - 52 , mendez et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "if accreting matter always arrives with the specific angular momentum of a particle orbiting at the ns radius ( @xmath16 ) , then it only takes @xmath17 of accretion at @xmath18 for a @xmath19 ns to reach @xmath20 hz from an initially low frequency .",
    "it is thus remarkable that these nss are all rotating at nearly the same rate .",
    "white and zhang ( 1997 ) argued that this similarity arises because these nss are magnetic and have reached an equilibrium where the magnetospheric radius equals the co - rotation radius .",
    "this requires an intrinsic relation between their magnetic dipoles , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 so that they all reach the same rotational equilibrium ( most likely @xmath23 ) and a way of hiding the persistent pulse typically seen from a magnetic accretor .",
    "my alternative explanation for these spin similarities is that gravitational wave ( gw ) emission has started to play an important dnrole .",
    "if the ns has a misaligned quadrupole moment , @xmath24 , then the strong spin frequency dependence of gw emission defines a critical frequency beyond which accretion can no longer spin - up the star .",
    "such a ns will radiate energy via gw s at the rate @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , and lose angular momentum at the rate @xmath27 . balancing this spin - down torque with the characteristic spin - up torque from time - averaged accretion , @xmath28 ,",
    "gives the @xmath24 needed so as to make the critical frequency 300 hz , @xmath29 or @xmath30 of the ns moment of inertia , @xmath31 .",
    "the similarities in @xmath3 may then arise because of the weak dependencies of the critical frequency on @xmath24 and @xmath22 .    what is the source of the misaligned quadrupole ?",
    "wagoner ( 1984 ) argued that accreting nss would get hung - up at spin frequencies where the chandrasekhar - friedman - schutz ( cfs ) instability sets in .",
    "however , lindblom ( 1995 ) and lindblom & mendell ( 1995 ) have shown that the star needs to be very near the breakup frequency ( @xmath32 ) for such an instability to occur , even for the core temperatures @xmath33 of rapidly accreting nss ( ayasli & joss 1978 ; brown & bildsten 1998 ) .",
    "the spin frequencies for these nss are too slow for such an instability .",
    "i present in  2 a new source for lateral density variations in an accreting ns ; electron captures ( hereafter ec ) in the crust .",
    "the constant compression of the crust forces nuclei to undergo ec when the electron fermi energy , @xmath34 , is high enough to make a transition .",
    "however , the crust is hot enough in a rapidly accreting nss to make the ec rates temperature sensitive .",
    "hotter regions then capture at lower pressures , so that the density jump associated with the ec is at a higher altitude in the hotter parts of the crust .",
    "moderate lateral temperature variations then lead to density variations large enough to generate the required @xmath24 .",
    "this outcome is independent of the particular source of the temperature variations .",
    "one possible cause for a @xmath35 asymmetry relative to the spin axis is a weak magnetic field .",
    "i conclude in  3 by finding the gw signal strength and estimating detection .",
    "these nss accrete hydrogen and helium rich material from their companions , and within days of reaching the surface , this matter is burned to heavy elements . the composition of these ashes is still uncertain , but most certainly consists of heavy nuclei , potentially beyond the iron group ( schatz et al . 1997 ) .",
    "this material replaces the primordial ns crust and becomes neutron rich by successive ec .",
    "later on , neutron emissions and pycnonuclear reactions occur ( bisnovatyi - kogan & chechetkin 1979 ; sato 1979 ; haensel & zdunik 1990 ( hereafter hz ) ) . for the @xmath22 s and residual hydrogen abundance ( taam , woosley , & lamb 1996 ) appropriate for these nss ,",
    "the temperature of the accumulating matter and deep crust is @xmath36 ( brown & bildsten 1998 ) .",
    "i confine my discussion in this _",
    "letter _ to the outer crust ( before neutron drip at @xmath37 , hz ) , which is held up by degenerate and relativistic electrons .",
    "they exert a pressure @xmath38 from which the mass of the shell above a particular depth is @xmath39 , where @xmath40 , or @xmath41 the crust is compressed on a timescale @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the local accretion rate , so that @xmath34 rises with time , eventually leading to nuclear ec .",
    "many ( sato 1979 ; hz ) presumed that the captures were instantaneous once @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the mass difference between the ( a , z ) nucleus and ( a , z-1 ) nucleus . in reality , the transitions will not occur until the ec lifetime is comparable to @xmath46 ( blaes et al .",
    "1990 ) . for low accretion rates",
    "@xmath47 , blaes et al .",
    "( 1990 ) showed that most captures occur in a thin zone where @xmath44 only slightly .",
    "the situation is different for the high @xmath22 s of the bright x - ray sources , as the high crustal temperature leads to most ec occurring out on the thermal tail at a physical location where @xmath48 .",
    "i consider a region of the crust consisting of a single nucleus of charge @xmath49 and mass @xmath50 . for many nuclei , the capture to the ground state of the ( a , z-1 ) nucleus",
    "is highly forbidden and proceeds more slowly than @xmath46 .",
    "the element is still abundant when @xmath34 reaches a value where a more favorable transition to an excited state of the ( a , z-1 ) nucleus can occur . for this reason",
    ", i estimate the ec rates by using @xmath51 values in the range of allowed reactions , @xmath52 .",
    "since these stars are hot enough for the sub - threshold ec to dominate , the transition occurs when @xmath53 , where @xmath54 depends logarithmically on @xmath43 , @xmath35 and @xmath51 ( bildsten & cumming 1998 ) .",
    "a hotter region undergoes the transition at a higher altitude ( call @xmath55 the distance down to the transition from where @xmath56 , i.e. @xmath57 increases into the star ) compared to a colder region .",
    "figure [ fig : capture ] displays the ec transition layer for a ns accreting at @xmath58 . as an example i chose the nucleus @xmath59ca , which captures at @xmath60 mev , where @xmath61 .",
    "this is the fourth ec transition that hz found when starting with @xmath59fe .",
    "since this is a generic process , i show cases for @xmath62 ( dotted ) and @xmath63 ( solid ) for ( from left to right in the upper and lower panels ) @xmath64 and 2 . the density jump associated with the ecs is evident and ,",
    "if discontinuous , would be @xmath65 .",
    "if a transverse temperature gradient is present in the crust , then these ecs generate density asymmetries on the star and a quadrupole with mass @xmath66 .",
    "the mass inferred from the @xmath62 case for a temperature contrast @xmath67 ( where the difference in physical depth of the ec is @xmath68 ) is @xmath69 , just what is needed for gw s to be important . more generally , the mass involved is @xmath70 , or since @xmath71 , @xmath72 for a single ec layer .",
    "since there are a few more electron capture layers underneath this one , there is adequate mass to generate the required @xmath24 when @xmath73 .",
    "the repercussions of the deeper reactions is still unknown .    the ec s deposit heat directly into the crust , generating a flux @xmath74 , where @xmath75 ( hz ) .",
    "temporal variations in @xmath43 lead to local heating at these depths , which takes a few years to equilibrate in the radial direction .",
    "the heat transfer is fixed by electron conduction at these depths , so that the conductivity is @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the electron - phonon scattering frequency ( yakovlev & urpin 1980 ) .",
    "the time it takes heat to cross a scale height , @xmath78 , is then @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the specific heat at constant pressure .",
    "however , lateral thermal asymmetries will persist as long as the heating time , @xmath81 , is shorter than the time to transport heat around the star at the same depth .",
    "that time is @xmath82 , so for @xmath83 , the time to transport heat around the crust is longer than the time to locally heat it .",
    "all of the objects i am discussing are in this regime and so large - scale temperature asymmetries can persist as long as the system is being perturbed in some way .",
    "though the origin of lateral @xmath35 gradients is still unknown , it is difficult for conduction to wash them out .",
    "for example , large - scale @xmath43 or compositional variations ( due to , say , magnetically channeled flow or a `` buried field '' ) will imprint large scale @xmath35 asymmetries .",
    "the pressure as a function of depth in the ec region is shown in the middle panel of figure 1 . even though the density contrasts are large , the pressure contrasts are not .",
    "if one part of the star has a slightly deeper capture zone , at @xmath84 , then the pressures at a fixed depth @xmath85 relate via @xmath86 .",
    "the pressure is higher underneath the layer that captured sooner due to the `` extra weight '' of the dense layer .",
    "since @xmath87 , the lateral pressure contrast at a fixed depth , @xmath88 , is @xmath89 .",
    "these transverse pressure gradients would lead to flow and a cancellation of the quadrupole if the matter was in a liquid state .",
    "however , as long as @xmath90 , the matter is solid at these depths and has a finite shear modulus , @xmath91 ( strohmayer et al .",
    "the transverse pressure gradients are then balanced by a slight amount of shear stress as the matter underneath the cooler regions laterally shifts a distance @xmath92 .",
    "roughly , @xmath92 is found from the transverse momentum equation @xmath93 , or @xmath94 .",
    "this gives @xmath95 , or a few meters of transverse displacement over the whole surface .",
    "for now , i will presume that this configuration will not crack .",
    "relative vertical motion has yet to be investigated and could reduce the estimated @xmath24 .",
    "most accreting , weakly magnetic neutron stars are spinning at @xmath96 .",
    "i conjecture that this similarity is the result of an equilibrium where the angular momentum accreted is radiated away in gravitational waves .",
    "i showed that pre - threshold electron captures will turn any lateral temperature gradients into lateral density gradients . in this case , a small spin - misaligned temperature gradient gives rise to a quadrupole , @xmath97 , adequate to explain the similarities at @xmath98 .",
    "these accretion - induced @xmath24 s clearly make it difficult to spin up a neutron star to 1000 hz by accreting at @xmath99 .",
    "indeed , a ns spinning at 1000 hz with @xmath100 would be difficult to spin - up even at @xmath101 .",
    "the lateral @xmath35 asymmetries should subside at lower @xmath22 s , reducing @xmath24 ( see the dependence in equation [ [ eq : mquad ] ] ) and potentially making it easier to reach higher @xmath3 by accreting slowly for a long period of time .",
    "there is already some hint of this , as the highest @xmath22 sources seem to be rotating the slowest .",
    "independent of the cause of the @xmath35 asymmetry , if gravitational radiation is the explanation of the spin similarities , then the characteristic gw signal strength at earth ( suitably averaged over spin orientations , brady et al .",
    "1998 ) is @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the distance to the object ( the prefactor is 4 when looking down the spin axis ) .",
    "presuming the ns luminosity is @xmath104 then @xmath105 is written in terms of the observable @xmath106 ( wagoner 1984 ) @xmath107 which represents a lower limit for @xmath105 due to the @xmath108 to @xmath22 conversion i chose and since @xmath109 is never fully measured .",
    "the minimum @xmath105 s for those nss which have @xmath3 inferred from type i bursts are shown in table 1 .",
    "there are many nss for which only @xmath14 has been measured ( see van der klis 1998 for a summary ) .",
    "the average 2 - 10 kev fluxes from van paradijs ( 1995 ) imply the following gw amplitudes : gx 349 + 2 ( @xmath110 , @xmath111 , zhang et al .",
    "1998b ) , 4u  1820 - 30 ( @xmath112 , @xmath113 ) , gx 17 + 2 ( @xmath114 , @xmath115 ) , 4u  0614 + 09 ( @xmath116 , @xmath117 ) , gx 5 - 1 ( @xmath118 , @xmath119 ) cyg x-2 ( @xmath120 , @xmath113 ) , and gx 340 + 0 ( @xmath121 , @xmath113 , jonker et al .",
    "1998 ) .    the highest flux object that shows khz qpo s is sco x-1 with an orbital period of 18.9 hours .",
    "it s difference frequency is not constant however ( van der klis et al .",
    "1997 ) and so we are still uncertain about the exact spin frequency .",
    "if it is rotating at @xmath122 , then @xmath123 at @xmath124 .",
    "detection of a weak periodic gravitational wave signal depends on the ability to coherently fold large data sets for a long time , @xmath125 , in order to obtain the @xmath126 signal enhancement .",
    "the initial ligo interferometer will have @xmath127 at @xmath128 ( abramovici et al .",
    "1992 ) , requiring integration times @xmath129 .",
    "if the orbital parameters , spin frequency and phase were known for sco x-1 , then brady et al.s ( 1998 ) work implies it would be detected at 99% confidence with the initial ligo in about one year .",
    "however , our lack of detailed prior information on these parameters demands a larger parameter space search .",
    "the consequent reduction in the @xmath130 ( maybe a factor of @xmath131 ) make it more likely that detection will have to wait for the enhanced ligo ( see thorne 1998 for the sensitivities ) .",
    "the similar spin frequencies of so many objects give an advantage to dual - recycling interferometers ( such as geo  600 and tama 300 ) .",
    "indeed , the geo 600 noise strength ( from strain et al . 1998 ) when tuned to sco x-1 is competitive with the initial ligo and virgo .",
    "detection of the larger number of nss ) accreting pulsar that a coherent data fold can be undertaken .",
    "unfortunately , the time averaged flux ( i estimate @xmath132 at most ) is low and even if looking right down the spin - axis , @xmath133 .",
    "it might be that spin - down in quiescence is the best indicator of gw emission from this ns .",
    "] with @xmath134 will have to wait for advanced broad - band interferometers ( such as advanced ligo ) , further developments in the dual - recycled interferometers , or larger cryogenic detectors .",
    "the stability of the gw signal depends on the origin of the mass quadrupole . for the ec origin",
    ", i would not expect major differences in @xmath24 on timescales shorter than the thermal time ( years ) .",
    "another relevant time is that to replenish the thickness of the ec layer , which is @xmath135 years at @xmath136 .",
    "however , since @xmath22 varies , we can not expect the torques to always be in balance .",
    "for example , if @xmath22 were to drop suddenly , the instantaneous spin - down of the ns due to the equilibrium @xmath24 would be @xmath137 .",
    "this would lead to one pulse cycle of drift in a time @xmath138 days .",
    "how does this work affect the accretion spin - up scenario for making millisecond pulsars ?",
    "the ec @xmath24 will decrease once accretion has halted and the temperature equilibrates . in addition , when the crust is cold , it only takes @xmath139 of accretion to wash out the compositional gradients generated during accretion at high rates .",
    "there is an important comparison to make in this regard .",
    "namely , as long as @xmath24 decays on a timescale , @xmath140 , much shorter than @xmath141 then the millisecond pulsar is `` born '' at roughly the same spin period since @xmath142 .",
    "if @xmath24 persists at some low level long after accretion has ended , it could still play an important role . indeed , as many have shown ( thorne 1987 , new et al .",
    "1995 , brady et al .",
    "1998 ) a small @xmath24 can go a long way towards explaining the observed spin - down of millisecond pulsars _ and _ making them detectable as gw sources .",
    "transverse @xmath35 gradients may be more prevalent on the @xmath143 accreting pulsars",
    ". however , most of them have @xmath144 so that the @xmath24 needed for gw equilibrium is implausibly large , making it unlikely that gw s play an important role in their spin evolution .",
    "however , there is a lack of accreting pulsars with @xmath145 that is usually explained by stating that all pulsars have reached their magnetic equilibrium and that few have @xmath1 .",
    "if we presume a maximum allowed quadrupole @xmath146 ( thorne 1987 ) , then gw emission could play an important role when @xmath147 , only somewhat alleviating this issue .",
