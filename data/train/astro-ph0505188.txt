    "using the hamilton - jacobi theory we have studied nonlinear evolutions of inhomogeneous spacetimes when scalar fields are nonminimally coupled with the spacetime curvature @xmath4 . and we have found analytic and numerical solutions for several classes of inflation potentials during the inflation period .",
    "the inflation potentials thus studied could be categorized into three different types - a large field , small field , and hybrid field model , depending on the potential shape and the initial condition of scalar fields . though it is believed that in the nonminimally coupled scalar theory , the new inflation , a small field model , may not have an inflationary solution , we have shown through an approximation and numerics that the new inflation potential can provide a quasi - exponential inflationary solution .",
    "careful scrutiny is in order before reaching a definite conclusion for the existence of inflationary solutions .",
    "for the hybrid inflation potential , we have assumed that the inflaton field dominates the potential .",
    "however , if the potential is dominated by the vacuum energy , which is the limit of the small field model , the other scalar field , @xmath141 , plays a significant role in terminating the inflation",
    ". it would be interesting to consider the inflationary solutions for multi - field potentials .    in the case of @xmath71 ,",
    "the coupling constant is restricted to a range of @xmath214 to have the number of @xmath52-folds greater than @xmath89 whose value is needed to resolve the well known cosmological puzzles . on the other hand , in the case of @xmath83 , @xmath215 in the large field or small field model",
    "does not lead to any constraint on @xmath6 to satisfy the observational bound on @xmath53 , but @xmath216 in the large field model or hybrid field model with @xmath217 , the scaled field @xmath218 should be smaller than @xmath181 and @xmath219 .",
    "if these potentials in the original frame called jordan frame are transformed into those in the einstein frame by a conformal transformation , the local maxima of the potentials are located at @xmath220 for @xmath221 and @xmath222 for the hybrid field model .",
    "if the field @xmath12 is greater than @xmath162 , it goes away to infinity and never reaches the origin .",
    "however , if the scalar field has a very large negative initial velocity , it can cross over the potential barrier and evolve toward the origin .",
    "but the number of @xmath52-folds being greater than @xmath89 restricts to the nonminimal coupling constant to @xmath98",
    ".    it would be more helpful to understand analytically or numerically the behaviors of nonlinear evolutions of inhomogeneous spacetimes in the nonminimally coupled scalar field theory beyond the zeroth order hamilton - jacobi equation , which will be addressed in a future publication .",
