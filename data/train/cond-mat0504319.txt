    "it has been shown that the absolute value of a self - consistent order parameter and @xmath76 are suppressed near the interface and at the distances of the order of the coherence length , while its dependence on the direction in the momentum space ( @xmath77 ) remains unaltered @xcite .",
    "consequently , this suppression does nt influence the josephson effect drastically .",
    "this suppression of the order parameter keeps the current - phase dependence unchanged but , it changes the amplitude value of the current .",
    "for example , it has been verified in refs.@xcite for the junction between unconventional @xmath16-wave , in ref.@xcite for the case of `` @xmath14-wave '' superconductors and in ref.@xcite for pinholes in @xmath78 that , there is a good qualitative agreement between self - consistent and non - self - consistent results .",

    "consequently , despite the fact that self - consistent numerical results can not be applied directly for a quantitative analysis of the real experiment , only a qualitative comparison of calculated and experimental current - phase relations is possible . in our calculations , a simple model of the constant order parameter up to the interface",
    "is considered and the pair breaking and the scattering on the interface are ignored .",
    "we believe that under these strong assumptions our results describe the real situation qualitatively . in the framework of such model , the analytical expressions for the current can be obtained for an arbitrary form of the order parameter .",

    "the spatial variation of the phase of the order parameter plays a role as the origin of the charge current and , similarly , due to the broken @xmath154 symmetry , a spatial difference of the gap vectors in two half - spaces is the cause of spin currents .",
    "this is because there is a position - dependent phase difference between `` spin up '' and `` spin down '' cooper pairs and , although the total charge current vanishes , there can be a net transfer of the spin .",
    "therefore , in our system , there is a discontinuous jump between the gap vectors and , consequently the spin currents should generally be present .",
    "for instance , if up - spin states and down - spin states have a velocity in the opposite direction , the charge currents cancel each other whereas the spin current is being transported . mathematically speaking , @xmath155 ,",
    "so it is possible to find the state in which one of these current terms is zero and the other term has a finite value @xcite . in conclusion , the spin current in the absence of the charge current can be observed and vice versa .",
