    "the ultimate fate of the most massive stars in our galaxy and other galaxies is still not well understood .",
    "the post - main - sequence evolution of stars with masses @xmath3@xmath4 , theoretically , should take them possibly through the red supergiant phase , or directly to the luminous blue variable ( lbv ) phase , en route to becoming hydrogen - deficient or hydrogenless wolf - rayet stars toward the end of their lives ( e.g. , langer et al .  1994 ; stothers & chin 1996 ) .",
    "although the number of known examples of lbvs is small ( humphreys & davidson 1994 ) , the spectacular cases of @xmath1 carinae ( e.g. , davidson & humphreys 1997 ) and the pistol star ( figer et al .  1998 , 1999 ) show that they go through spectacular eruptive phases of mass ejection .",
    "it is assumed that very massive stars ultimately explode as supernovae ( sne ; e.g. , woosley , langer , & weaver 1993 ) , but it is still possible that they `` fail '' to become supernovae and core collapse directly to form black holes ( macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) .",
    "the spectroscopic characteristics of sne have been recently reviewed by filippenko ( 1997 , 2000a ) . in brief , type i sne ( sne i ) , lacking hydrogen in their optical spectra , divide into the classical sne ia , which probably arise from exploding white dwarf stars , and sne ib / c , which appear to be more closely related to type ii sne .",
    "all sne ii show hydrogen in their optical spectra and are thought to arise from the explosions of massive stars ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "great variation exists in the strength and profile of the hydrogen lines of sne ii . a growing number of `` peculiar '' sne ii show a hydrogen emission - line combination of a narrow component atop a broader component ( sometimes having a complex shape ) , with no p - cygni - like absorption trough .",
    "these are the sne ii-``narrow '' ( sne iin ; schlegel 1990 ; filippenko 1991 ) .    as of 2000",
    "may , 43 sne iin have been identified ( from the online asiago sn catalogsupern / snean.txt ] and the iau circulars ) .",
    "the balmer emission has been interpreted as arising from interaction of the sn ultraviolet radiation and the sn ejecta with a dense circumstellar medium set up by the progenitor in a pre - sn phase .",
    "evidence is accumulating that sne iin arise from very massive stars ( e.g. , weiler , panagia , & sramek 1990 ; sollerman , cumming , & lundqvist 1998 ) .",
    "it seems likely that the old zwicky ( 1965 ) `` type v '' sne , examples of which include sne 1954j and 1961v , and which are now generally considered to have been peculiar sne ii ( doggett & branch 1985 ; filippenko 1991 ) , are related to sne iin .",
    "for instance , sn 1986j , a prototypical sn iin , was originally classified as type v ( rupen et al .",
    "however , particularly in the case of sn 1961v ( goodrich et al .  1989 ; filippenko et al .",
    "1995 ) , it appears that not all of the zwicky types were genuine sne , strictly defined to be the violent destruction of a star at the end of its life . by extension ,",
    "then , it is intriguingly possible that not all sne iin are `` real '' sne .",
    "some sne iin could represent a pre - sn cataclysmic event of a very massive star .",
    "this `` contamination '' of the sn iin subtype complicates calculations of the production rate of neutron stars and the chemical evolution of galaxies , and adds a new wrinkle in the evolution of the most massive stars .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the example of the sn iin 1997bs in ngc 3627 ( m66 ) .",
    "sn 1997bs was the first sn discovered by the lick observatory supernova search ( lossbait / kait.html ] , the direct successor of the former search at leuschner observatory ) , which is robotically conducted with the 0.75-m katzman automatic imaging telescope ( kait ; see filippenko et al .",

    "on 1997 april 16 , ccd spectra of sn 1997bs were obtained by filippenko , barth , & gilbert ( 1997 ) with the kast spectrograph ( miller & stone 1993 ) on the shane 3-m reflector at lick observatory .",
    "the slit width was 2 , and three different gratings and grisms were used to span the wavelength range 32008000   with a typical resolution of about 7  .",
    "the spectra were extracted and calibrated following standard procedures , and we took special care to remove telluric absorption features through division by the spectrum of the flux comparison star . owing to variable seeing ,",
    "the absolute flux calibration is only approximate , but the shape of the spectrum should be reasonably accurate .",

    "these pre - sn images served as `` templates '' which were subtracted from the sn images in each of the four bands ( see filippenko et al .",
    "1986 ; richmond et al .",
    "first , for each band , the template was registered to a sn image , so that stars in the field were aligned , and the template image was convolved with a gaussian to match the fwhm of stars in the sn image .",
    "then , the stars in the template image were flux - scaled to match the stars in the sn image , and , finally , the template was subtracted from the sn image , leaving behind a residual image containing only the sn .",
    "this procedure was followed for each observational epoch .",
    "photometry of the sn in each band and for each epoch was done on the template - subtracted image using the apphot package in iraf .",
    "measurements of the field stars `` 3 '' and `` 4 '' ( see wells et al .",

    "wfpc2 images of ngc 3627 in the bands f555w and f814w were obtained from the image archive .",
    "these images were made in pairs ( to facilitate removal of cosmic rays ) between late 1997 and early 1998 during several epochs .",
    "they were originally intended to measure the distance to the galaxy using cepheid variables ( go program 6549 ) , with the goal of determining the absolute magnitude of sn 1989b ( saha et al .  1999 ; their table 1 lists the exposures ) .",
    "saha et al .",

    "the artificial psf was created at the pixel position of the sn in the archive images .",
    "since the stellar profiles in the images were actually somewhat broader than the artificial psf , the latter was broadened using a gaussian to match the former .",
    "instrumental photometry was aperture corrected , using measurements of artificial stars of known magnitude placed randomly in the field , and converted to magnitudes using the photometric synthetic zeropoints in holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995 ; their table 9 ) , appropriate for a @xmath13 aperture radius . a correction for the gain ratio to the 7 @xmath15 adu@xmath12 gain state was applied .",
    "in table 2 we list the kait photometry for sn 1997bs , while table 3 gives the photometry derived from the archival _ hst _ f555w and f814w images .",
    "our _ hst _ photometry of sn 1997bs agrees quite well with that from saha et al .",

    "we show the combined @xmath0 light curves for the sn , including both the kait and _ hst _ photometry .",
    "the f555w and f814w measurements correspond approximately to @xmath16 and @xmath17 magnitudes , respectively .",
    "these wfpc2 synthetic magnitudes were _ not _ converted to the johnson - cousins system following ( for example ) the transformations given by holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ; for an emission - line object such as sn 1997bs , this conversion may not be entirely correct or appropriate .",
    "sn 1997bs was apparently discovered before maximum brightness in @xmath18 , and generally at or near maximum in the other bands .",
    "the sn light curves decline from peak brightness over the next @xmath1920 days by @xmath191 mag .",
    "the decline in @xmath16 is less drastic after about jd 2450580 . in @xmath18 and @xmath17",
    ", the light curves appear to reach a plateau of roughly constant magnitude in each band .",
    "( the observational coverage in @xmath20 terminates after jd 2450582 . )",
    "the kait photometry in all bands ends on jd 2450617 , after a span of nearly 60 days of monitoring .",
    "there is a long , @xmath19150-day gap in our coverage before we are able to extend the light curves using the _ hst _ photometry in ( approximately ) @xmath16 and @xmath17 bands .",
    "it is apparent in @xmath16 that the light curve began a much steeper decline on or before jd 2450765 ; the slope of the decline is quite similar to the slope of the earlier post - maximum decline .",
    "the @xmath16 light curve , again , achieves a more gradual decline after about jd 2450786 .",
    "in fact , after jd 2450804 , the @xmath16 magnitude of the sn appears to reach another plateau , at @xmath1923.4 mag .",
    "the @xmath17 light curve at late times appears to gradually decline , at a slower rate than the earlier post - maximum decline ( the sn is partially saturated in the first - epoch f814w image , so we can only give a lower limit to its brightness ) .    in figure 4",
    "we show the color evolution of the sn . for the first 60 days",
    ", the sn color becomes generally redder after discovery .",
    "this is best exemplified by the evolution of the @xmath21 color , which near maximum already is at @xmath22 mag , but , even before the end of kait monitoring , has reached @xmath23 mag . by the time monitoring resumes , with the inclusion of the _ hst _ data ,",
    "the sn is very red , at @xmath24 mag .",
    "the red color of the sn is obvious in the color composite image shown by saha et al .",
    "( 1999 ; their figure 1 ) .",
    "the sn possibly may have been much redder than this prior to its recovery in the _ hst _ images : it becomes bluer at late times , to @xmath25 mag in the last f555w / f814w image pair .",
    "although the spectrum of sn 1997bs indicates that it is a sn iin , its photometric nature is unusual , both in the behavior of the light curves and in absolute magnitude .",
    "since the distance modulus of ngc 3627 has been measured with cepheids ( @xmath26 mag ; saha et al .",
    "1999 ) , we can adjust our observed light curves of sn 1997bs to an absolute scale .",
    "we would like to correct the absolute light curves for extinction , but the amount of reddening toward sn 1997bs is not known .",
    "the galactic foreground reddening toward ngc 3627 is @xmath27 mag ( schlegel et al .",
    "however , sn 1997bs occurred at the edge of a dust lane in ngc 3627 , so it is likely that reddening internal to the galaxy at the site of the sn is appreciable and spatially variable .",
    "we have attempted to estimate the reddening , based on the colors of stars in the sn environment ( see below ) , yet the stellar colors , particularly for the bluest stars , are consistent with the foreground reddening estimate .    from the light curves , we find that the @xmath28 color near maximum was 0.67 mag . if the intrinsic color was close to @xmath29 , which is what one might expect for sne ii , then @xmath30 mag .",
    "however , the spectrum of sn 1997bs dereddened by this amount would make the sn continuum unphysically blue , so already we know the reddening can not be this large",
    ". the emission - line intensity ratios of h@xmath31/h@xmath32/h@xmath33 are 2.6/1.0/0.5 , which , if anything , are slightly flatter than what one expects for case b recombination ( 2.8/1.0/0.47 ) ; so , there is no evidence for reddening of the emission lines .",
    "we measure an equivalent width of 1.8   for the narrow na i d absorption line at the redshift of the sn ( unfortunately , the two line components are not resolved ) .",
    "though with low - resolution spectra one can not confidently translate this into a reddening ( one actually needs high - dispersion spectra ) , an analysis similar to that of filippenko , porter , & sargent ( 1990 ) suggests a reddening of @xmath34 mag .",
    "moreover , when this type of analysis was applied to the sn ic 1987 m by jeffery et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , they argued that it overestimates @xmath35 by a factor 1.8 . if we scale our estimate for sn 1997bs by this factor , then @xmath36 mag .",
    "we assume this value to be the total ( but quite uncertain ) reddening to the sn and correct the observed light curves for it , using a standard galactic reddening law ( cardelli , clayton , & mathis 1989 ) , @xmath37 .",
    "sn 1997bs appears to be unusual with respect to most other sne ii ( or other sn types ) , due to its very faint absolute magnitude : maximum for the sn was at only @xmath38 mag , about 4 to 4.5 mag fainter than a typical sn ii .    in figure 5",
    "we show the object s unusual photometric evolution through a comparison of the absolute @xmath16 light curves of sn 1997bs and of the sne iin 1988z ( turatto et al .",
    "1993 ) , 1987b ( schlegel et al .",
    "1996 ) , and 1994y ( ho et al .",
    "( distances to the latter three sne were calculated from their recession velocities , obtained from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database and an assumed distance scale @xmath39 km s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 .",
    "no extinction corrections have been applied for these sne . )",
    "the light curves of the three comparison sne iin have been scaled , so that their maximum observed brightness occurs at approximately the same epoch as sn 1997bs .",
    "one can see that , besides the obvious underluminosity , the post - maximum decline of sn 1997bs is very different in behavior from that of the other sne .",
    "one also notices from figure 5 that , at late times , the f555w light curve ( in particular ) appears to reach a plateau once again , at @xmath40 mag ( or @xmath1923.4 mag from figure 3 ) .",
    "none of the other sne iin , particularly sn 1994y , show this sort of behavior .",
    "van dyk et al .  ( 1999 ) found in the f606w image from 1994 december 28 , about 27.5 months _ before _ the discovery of sn 1997bs , a star at the exact position of the sn , with @xmath41 mag . assuming @xmath42 , the star had an absolute magnitude @xmath43 mag , at the distance of ngc 3627 and corrected for our assumed reddening .",
    "van dyk et al .  associated this star with the progenitor of sn 1997bs .",
    "the late - time brightness of sn 1997bs is @xmath190.5 mag fainter than the brightness of this precursor star ( see figure 6 ) .",
    "however , the unusual apparent flattening - out of the late - time light curve suggests that the star _ may _ have survived the explosion .",
    "this raises the question of whether sn 1997bs was really a _",
    "bona fide _ supernova , or instead was something altogether different .",
    "we believe that the evidence presented in this paper indicates that sn 1997bs was more likely the super - outburst of a very massive lbv star , possibly analogous to the enormous eruptions experienced by @xmath1 carinae ( davidson & humphreys 1997 ) .",
    "the @xmath16 light curve , in particular , shows that sn 1997bs brightened by nearly 6 mag before fading , possibly through the formation of optically thick dust , given how red it became .",
    "sn 1997bs is not alone in its unusual characteristics",
    ". a similar object may be the peculiar sn iin 1961v in ngc 1058 .",
    "sn 1961v was originally classified as `` type v '' by zwicky ( 1964 , 1965 ) and had probably the most bizarre light curve ever recorded for a sn .",
    "its progenitor was identified as a very luminous star , @xmath44 mag , visible in many photographs of ngc 1058 prior to the explosion ( bertola 1964 ; zwicky 1964 ; klemola 1986 ) .",

    "we can compare the photometric behavior of sn 1997bs with that of the @xmath1 car - like variables discussed thoroughly by humphreys , davidson , & smith ( 1999 ) . in figure 6 we show the light curve of sn 1997bs , along with the schematic light curves for @xmath1 car , sn 1961v , and sn 1954j ( also known as `` variable 12 , '' v12 , in ngc 2403 ; humphreys & davidson 1994 ) .",

    "we have adjusted all of the curves to absolute magnitudes : the distances to sn 1961v ( 8 mpc ) , sn 1954j ( 3.2 mpc ) , and @xmath1 car ( 2300 pc ) are from goodrich et al .",

    "all of the curves have been further adjusted , so that the maxima occur at the same time .",
    "overall , there are a number of similarities between these various light curves , although there are also some notable differences .",
    "the eruption of @xmath1 car lasted 20 years , while the outburst of sn 1997bs , with its shorter duration , is much more similar to those of sn 1961v and possibly v12 in ngc 2403 .",
    "however , the maximum luminosity of the sn 1997bs outburst is very much like that of the great eruption of @xmath1 car .",
    "given the short duration of its eruption , the total energy emitted by sn 1997bs is much less than either @xmath1 car or sn 1961v and is probably more like that of v12 or p cygni ( not shown here , but also discussed by humphreys et al .",
    "sn 1961v and v12 show a flattening ( plateau ) one to two years past maximum , similar to the behavior shown by sn 1997bs , and years later faded considerably , probably due to the formation of dust in the ejected material ( goodrich et al .",

    "with @xmath43 mag , it is too luminous to have been an o - type star and was most likely a supergiant later in spectral type than o9 or b0 . if the pre - outburst star was in an lbv quiescent state , then it was most likely a mid b - type star , with a surface temperature of 20,000 - 25,000 k and @xmath47 to @xmath48 mag , which is typical for these objects , with initial mass @xmath1960 @xmath49 and a main sequence lifetime of @xmath194 myr ( humphreys & davidson 1994 ; humphreys et al .  1999 ;",

    "we have analyzed the environment of sn 1997bs by measuring the magnitudes , using the psf - fitting techniques described in  2.3 , of the stars in a 20  ( north - south ) @xmath50 12  ( east - west ) region centered on sn 1997bs .",
