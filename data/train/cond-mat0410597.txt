    "we report new results on the energy per particle at the onset of this crossover in such an arbitrary dimension ( suitably defined by the appearance of zero - energy two particle bound states ) .",
    "this extension enables us to examine crossovers in low dimensions where no condensed phases occur due to the enhanced role of low energy fluctuations .",

    "by contrast , due to localization tendencies in low dimensions ( @xmath9 ) , each particle carries , on average , the mean energy of a free fermi system at the appearance of the first two particle bound states . the physically pertinent well known question @xcite concerns the energy per particle in actual transitions occurring in @xmath4 dimensions .",

    "( regretfully , we have not been able to devise a wavefunction which will lead to new stringent variational bounds on the three - dimensional problem . )",
    "putting all of the pieces together , we find by extending the problem to any dimension @xmath7 while insisting on having precisely one zero energy bound state that @xmath0 is non - trivial only within the interval @xmath79 . from this perspective , the only interesting integer dimensionality is , in fact , the original d=3 !    there may be other extensions of the problem which might be non - trivial in all dimensions .",
    "many systems simplify at @xmath80 and a mean field approach may apply there also to fermionic problems @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that a certain class of diagrams dominates in this limit the perturbative series in an appropriate effective field theory and can be analytically summed in certain fashions to yield @xmath81 @xcite or @xmath82 @xcite .    in what briefly follows ,",
    "we employ the above continuation with a primary focus on energetics ( i.e. , the existence of a zero energy s wave bound state ) rather than on the infinite scattering length .",
    "we find the resulting simple values @xmath83 for all ( continuous ) dimensions smaller than @xmath10 and @xmath84 for all @xmath8 interesting on their own right .",
    "localization tendencies present in low dimensions afford us with a direct result .",
    "purely attractive potentials @xmath39 have zero energy bound states in one _ and _ two dimensions @xcite , for any strength and @xmath24 .",
    "it follows that a bound state appears immediately as the two body attraction is introduced , i.e. @xmath85 . as the energy fraction @xmath86 is continuous in any dimension d , we find that @xmath87 similar incarnations of localization tendencies in low dimensions have proven very useful in other arenas ( e.g. @xcite in which a scaling theory of localization suggested @xmath10 as the marginal dimension for the appearance of metallic states ) .",
    "next , let us assume that the potential v vanishes outside the range @xmath30 .",
    "volume normalization factors aside , the spin - up spin - down , zero energy , pair wave function for relative separation @xmath88 is @xmath89 , with @xmath90 a dimension dependent numerical constant .",
    "the following is a very interesting observation : the integral representing the normalization of this zero energy wave function , @xmath91 $ ] diverges at small @xmath92 for @xmath8 .",
    "we consequently find that in @xmath93 dimensions most of the normalization of the zero energy bound state wave function is concentrated near @xmath94 and the dimers formed are actually compact  just like for large coupling in d=3 .",
    "hence , we can again neglect the overlap of the different dimers and attendant kinetic energy due to antisymmetrization in the spin up coordinates @xmath95 and separately in the spin down positions @xmath96 .",
