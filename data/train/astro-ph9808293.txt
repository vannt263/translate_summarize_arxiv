    "recent results from reverberation - mapping of the broad emission - line regions ( blr ) in agns indicate that the blr distance from the central radiation source roughly scales as @xmath3 ( koratkar & gaskell 1991 ; kaspi et.al .",
    "our model provides a physical explanation to this scaling , and predicts an additional testable dependence on the spectral shape .",
    "most workers today agree that the line width in agn is induced by keplerian bulk motions .",
    "if this is the case , the blr distance is directly related to the line width .",
    "a particularly interesting group in this respect are narrow - line seyfert galaxies ( nls1 ) , which have narrower emission lines than ordinary seyfert 1 galaxies , and often show steep soft x - ray spectra . in mixed samples ( nls1 and ordinary agn )",
    "the soft x - ray spectral index is anticorrelated with the h@xmath2 line width and with the h@xmath2 equivalent width .",
    "( boller , brandt , & fink 1996 ; wang , brinkmann and bergeron 1996 , hereafter wbb ) .",
    "we derive simple analytic relations between soft x - ray continuum spectrum ( luminosity and spectral index ) and the blr size and the width of the broad emission lines , explaining the observed anticorrelation between the x - ray slope and the line width and equivalent width ( wandel 1997 ; wandel and boller 1998 ) .",
    "application of this model to samples of agn gives a good agreement with the blr sizes determined by reverberation mapping , and with the observed fwhm(h@xmath2 ) .",
    "while there is probably a range of physical conditions ( ionization parameter and density etc . ) in the broad h@xmath2 line - emitting gas in agns , the emission of each line is dominated by emission in a relatively narrow optimum range of conditions ( baldwin et al .",
    "we will therefore make the assumption that the conditions relevant for h@xmath2 can be approximated by a single value .",
    "we show that within the observational constraints on the far uv and soft x - ray bands of agn spectra , the blr size and the line width predicted by the model are not very sensitive to the detailed shape of the spectrum in the euv band .",
    "we then estimate the blr size , and assuming keplerian velocity dispersion we relate it to the line width .",
    "the new element in our scheme is the use of the soft x - ray spectral index and luminosity to estimate the ionizing spectrum .",
    "the spectral index enters in the model as follows : a softer ( that is steeper ) spectrum has a stronger ionizing power , and hence the blr is formed at a larger distance from the central source , has a smaller velocity dispersion and produces narrower emission lines .",
    "we parameterize the form of the ionizing euv continuum in terms of the the break between the uv and x - ray bands and the measured soft x - ray slope @xmath4 .",
    "we assume that the spatial extent of the blr may be represented by a characteristic size - e.g. the radius at which the emission peaks .",
    "the physical conditions in the line - emitting gas are largely determined by the ionization parameter ( the ratio of ionizing photon density to the electron density , @xmath5 , e.g. netzer , 1990)@xmath6 where the ionizing photon flux ( number of ionizing photons per unit time ) is @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the luminosity per unit energy , and @xmath91 rydberg=13.6 ev . defining the ionizing luminosity , @xmath10 and the mean energy of an ionizing photon , @xmath11",
    ", the blr radius may be written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the observed x - ray luminosity , @xmath15 is the mean photon energy in rydberg , and @xmath16 .",
    "typical values in the gas emitting the high excitation broad lines are @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( e.g. rees , netzer and ferland , 1989 ) , so that @xmath19 .",
    "the ionizing flux is dominated by the euv continuum in the 1 - 10 rydberg regime , where most of the ionizing photons are emitted . since the the continuum in this range",
    "can not be observed directly , we try to estimate it by extrapolation from the nearest observable energy bands .",
    "the far uv spectrum has been observed beyond the lyman limit , for about 100 quasars ( zheng et al , 1996 ) , to wavelengths of 600     , and for a handful luminous , high redshift quasars to wavelengths of 350   .",
    "the average spectrum has a slope of @xmath20 in the 10002000     band , and below 900     it steepens to @xmath21 .",
    "we assume that the soft x - ray spectrum can be extrapolated to lower energies down to some break energy @xmath22 , and below the break we take @xmath23 .",
    "for the hard x - rays ( @xmath24  kev ) we use the `` universal '' @xmath25 power law , observed in most agn with a high energy cutoff at 100  kev .      assuming that the line width is induced by keplerian motion in the gravitational potential of the central mass , the velocity dispersion corresponding to the full width at half maximum of the emission lines is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the mass of the central black hole and r the distance of the broad line region from the central source .",
    "equation ( 1 ) gives @xmath28    in order to relate the unknown mass to the observed luminosity we assume that the central mass approximately scales with the luminosity ( dibai 1981 ; joly 1985 ; wandel & yahil 1985 ; wandel & mushotzky 1986 ) . in terms of the eddington ratio these authors find for large agn samples @xmath29 . within this distribution ,",
    "bright objects tend to have slightly larger @xmath30 ratios than faint ones ( cf .",
    "koratkar and gaskell 1991 ) roughly @xmath31 or @xmath32 . combining this with the correlation between the optical and the x - ray luminosities @xmath33 ( kriss 1988 ; mushotzky and wandel 1989 )",
    "gives @xmath34    and with eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) the line - width may be related directly to the observed x - ray luminosity and spectral index :    @xmath35 where @xmath36 combines all the unknown parameters ; for the @xmath19 and @xmath37 stated above we have @xmath38 .",
    "we have compared the blr size calculated from the model with the distance from the central source obtained by reverberation mapping of the h@xmath2 line , for a sample of 10 agn for which reverberation and x - ray data were available ( figure  2 ) .",
    "as we discuss below , the agreement _ actually improves _ by taking the x - ray spectral slope into account .    in the model calculations",
    "we have used the spectral index from the power - law fit to the rosat 0.1 - 2.4 kev band and @xmath39  ryd , the horizontal error bars represent the combined error in the luminosity and in the spectral index . allowing for the uncertainty in @xmath40 ( represented by the dashed lines in figure  1 ) , the agreement is quite good : all the points lie well within these boundaries .    in order to test the significance of our model",
    ", we have calculated the blr radii _ without _ taking into account the spectral dependence ( that is , assuming all objects have _ the same _ soft x - ray spectral slope , which we set to the sample average , @xmath4=1.45 ) .",
    "we find that the difference between the blr size ( calculated using only the luminosity scaling ) and the reverberation size is significantly larger than the difference when the spectral dependence is taken into account for three objects ( ngc  4151 , pg  0844 and ngc  3783 ) shown as gray dots in figure  1 .",
    "those are the objects with the most extreme values of @xmath4 . for the other objects in the sample",
    "the difference is small in both calculations",
    ".      equation ( 5 ) predicts an explicit relation between the velocity dispersion ( associated with the line width ) , the x - ray luminosity and the spectral index , namely a surface in the @xmath41 space . for a fixed value of @xmath42",
    "this gives a curve in the @xmath43 plane .",
    "figure 2 shows such curves of fwhm vs.@xmath4 for several values of the luminosity , @xmath44 ( wandel 1997 ) .",
    "overplotted are the data points - fwhm(h@xmath2 ) vs. @xmath4 for a sample of agn ( see below ) .",
    "the model seems to reproduce the distribution of the data very well , and in particular it explains the observed anticorrelation between the h@xmath2 line width and the soft x - ray spectral index and the lack of objects with broad lines and steep soft x - ray spectra .      in order to test the model prediction over the three dimensional @xmath45 space we compare the observed line width to the value calculated with equation ( 5 ) using the measured x - ray spectral index and luminosity for a sample consisting of 33 ordinary agn from walter & fink ( 1993 ) combined with 32 nlxgs ( boller , brandt , & , fink 1996 ) .",
    "as can be seen in figure  3 , the agreement is very good , and most of the objects fall well within the uncertainty strip of log @xmath46 . when the spectral information is not taken into account the correlation is significantly weaker .",
    "the correlation coefficients between the observed and calculated line widths are @xmath47 and 0.316 respectively .",
    "the data show that ( wbb ) agn with a steep soft x - ray spectrum have a lower ew(h@xmath2 ) than flat- spectrum agn .",
    "we now show that also this anti - correlation of the h@xmath2 equivalent width and @xmath4 follows in the framework of the model . to see this we recall that the equivalent width measures the fraction of the continuum flux reprocessed and emitted in the line .",
    "we have shown that the blr distance from the central source increases with the soft x - ray spectral index .",
    "the two - zone photoionization analyses of the blr ( brotherton 1994 ) shows that the covering factor in the more extended part blr part , the intermediate line region is about 10% of that in the near blr , indicating the integral covering factor decreases with radius . if such a geometry is common in agn , a steeper ( softer ) ionizing spectrum will lead to a smaller covering factor .",
    "this implies that the equivalent width decreases with increasing ( steepening ) spectral index , as observed .",
