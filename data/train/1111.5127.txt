    "the recent discovery of a pair of giant fermi bubbles in the galactic center ( gc ) is one of the most remarkable events in astrophysics .",
    "the first indication of the structure appeared in a paper by @xcite , which they called the fermi haze . using the special procedure of background subtraction of the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) data , @xcite discovered a pair of symmetric structures above and below the galactic plane in the gc direction .",
    "the origin of the bubble , if its existence can be proved , is still enigmatic , and up to now a few models have been presented in the literature .",
    "the team that subtracted this structured gamma - ray emission from the total diffuse galactic emission presented different explanations of the phenomenon , but they seemed to favor the model that a single massive release of energy in the gc when a huge cloud of gas or a star cluster was captured by the central supermassive black hole about 10 myr ago .",
    "a similar explanation was suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they assumed that the fermi bubbles were created by a recent active galactic nuclei jet activity about 1 - 2 myr ago , which was active for a duration of @xmath9 0.1 - 0.5 myr , releasing energy totaling @xmath9 ( 1 - 8)@xmath10 erg .",
    "the bipolar jets were ejected into the galactic halo along the symmetric axis perpendicular to the galactic plane .",
    "it is important to note that the existence of the bubbles was first evidenced in x - rays detected by _",
    "rosat _ as a narrow envelope with very sharp edges @xcite and later the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _",
    "( _ wmap _ ) detected an excess of radio signals at the location of the gamma - ray bubbles @xcite .",
    "the _ rosat _",
    "structure is explained as a fast wind with a velocity @xmath11 cm s@xmath3 driving a shock into the halo gas .",
    "this phenomenon requires an energy release of about @xmath12 erg at the gc and this activity should be periodic on a timescale of the order of 10 myr .",
    "this requirement of energy release in the gc is consistent with the observations of the existence of hot plasma with a temperature of about 10 kev in the gc region but with a radius of 30 - 50 pc only .",
    "this can not be confined and will escape from the gc with a speed of @xmath11 cm s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "therefore , sources with a power of about @xmath13 erg s@xmath3 must have heated the plasma or released @xmath14 erg from the gc in the past 10 myr . however ,",
    "@xcite have proposed a relatively slow energy release ( @xmath15 erg s@xmath3 ) from supernova ( sn ) explosions as a source of proton production in the gc .",
    "the observed gamma rays come from hadronic processes of the protons in the halo .",
    "the plasma in the halo is extremely turbulent and the protons are trapped for a time comparable to the hubble time . but this model requires a separate origin of electrons , which have a much shorter lifetime than protons , to explain the _ wmap _ data .    intensive energy release has been observed , indeed , at the center of normal galaxies as strong variations of x - ray radiation .",
    "there are common characteristics of these x - ray sources .",
    "first , all of them have been bright sources , and their x - ray luminosity could go up to about @xmath16 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "second , they have shown a high level of variability in their x - ray light curve within years . in the `` high state ''",
    ", the luminosity of one source could be at least 100 times higher than the luminosity in its `` low state '' .",
    "third , most of them have a super soft spectrum during the flare , with effective blackbody temperatures of only about 10 - 100 ev @xcite .",
    "the classic examples that satisfy these characteristics are rx j1624.9 + 7554 , rx j1242.6 - 1119a , rx j1420 + 5334 , rx j1331 - 3243 , and ngc 5905 .",
    "many scenarios have been proposed to explain these phenomena , but most of them fail to explain some of the observed results .",
    "a detailed discussion of these scenarios can be found in @xcite . among all of the listed models ,",
    "the tidal disruption model is the most commonly accepted , and it gives the most satisfactory explanation to the observations by considering the radiation from the disk . in this model , when a star passes by a black hole within a capture radius , where the black hole tidal force becomes stronger than the self - gravity of the star , the star can be captured . the detailed capture and disruption process of a main - sequence star has been studied by several authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the capture rate of main - sequence stars in our galaxy and in other galaxies is about @xmath17 yr@xmath3 to @xmath18 yr@xmath3 ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "dynamical studies of nearby galaxies suggest that most , if not all , galaxies with a bulge component host a central supermassive black hole and that the bulge and black hole mass are tightly correlated @xcite .",
    "the burst alert telescope on board _ swift _ has identified a transient x - ray source called grb110328a @xcite with later optical identification @xcite , which is located in the direction of the constellation draco when it erupted in a series of x - ray flares .",
    "the distance to this source is determined to be @xmath19 by using h@xmath20 and o@xmath21 emission lines by the gemini telescope @xcite .",
    "the characteristics of grb 110328a appear inconsistent with those of a gamma - ray burst @xcite .",
    "in fact , its time - dependent characteristics including various timescales in light curve , multi - wavelengths , etc .",
    ", seem to be better explained in terms of the tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole @xcite .",
    "all these recent observations suggest that stellar capture processes are quite common in other normal galaxies .",
    "observations have also revealed much evidence of unusual processes occurring in the central region of our galaxy , for instance , the enigmatic 511 kev annihilation emission discovered by the _ international gamma - ray astrophysics laboratory _ ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) whose origin is still debated .",
    "the hot plasma has a temperature of about 10 kev which can not be confined in the gc and , therefore , sources with a power of about @xmath13 erg s@xmath3 are required to heat the plasma ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "in fact , plasma outflows with velocities of @xmath22 cm s@xmath3 are observed from the nuclear region of our galaxy ( see * ? ? ? * ) and from the nucleus of andromeda @xcite .",
    "time variations of the 6.4 kev line and x - ray continuum emission observed in the direction of molecular clouds in the gc which are supposed to be a reflection of a giant x - ray flare occurred several hundred years ago ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* and references therein ) .",
    "hess observations of the gc in the tev energy range indicated an explosive injection of cosmic rays ( crs ) there , which might be associated with the supermassive black hole sgr a@xmath23 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .    in a series of papers @xcite",
    ", we developed a model of energy release in the gc due to star accretion onto the central black hole for the interpretation of x - ray and gamma - ray emission from the gc .",
    "our goal was to explain these observational data in the framework of a single model .",
    "basic assumptions in these models are ( 1 ) the galactic supermassive black hole sgr a@xmath1 can capture a star at a rate of @xmath24-@xmath18 yr@xmath3 , and ( 2 ) the energy release from each capture in the form of a flux of subrelativistic protons is @xmath25 erg , where @xmath26 ( in units of @xmath27 ) and @xmath28 ( in units of @xmath29 ) are the mass and the radius of the captured star , @xmath30 ( in units of @xmath31 ) is the mass of the supermassive black hole , and @xmath32 is the ratio of the periapse distance @xmath33 to the tidal radius @xmath34 ( see the review of * ? ? ?",

    "much longer than the capture timescale , this model can be treated to have an average power injection @xmath35 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "these protons heat the surrounding plasma by coulomb losses to 10 kev .",
    "based on this model , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ccdki model ) argued that up to several hundred capture events might have occured in the past 10 myr , which may have generated a series of shocks propagating through the central part of the galactic halo and thus produced accelerated relativistic electrons responsible for the bubble emission .",
    "processes of charged particle acceleration by the bubble shocks in terms of sizes of the envelope , maximum energy of accelerated particles , etc .",
    ", may differ significantly from those obtained for sne . in this paper",
    ", we examine whether a `` signal '' from charged particles accelerated in the bubble region can be seen in the spectrum of crs observed at the earth .",
    "we present simple estimations of hadronic cr acceleration by the fermi bubble shocks up to energies above @xmath36 ev . the paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "sect : snr ] , we review current understanding of cr acceleration by supernova remnants ( snrs ) and conclude that this process can only produce crs with energies less than @xmath36 ev .",
    "we present a simple solution of the multiple - shock structure in the halo in section  [ sect : structure ] . in section  [",
    "sect : bubbleshock ] we discuss the protons accelerated by the bubble shocks .",
    "we emphasize that a broken power law of particle distribution must be formed because of the finite spacing between consecutive shocks and the spectral break naturally occurs at @xmath37 ev . charged particles below and above this critical energy",
    "are accelerated by two different acceleration mechanisms . in section  [",
    "sect : beyondknee ] , we calculate the total particle spectrum by summing up the contribution from all shocks in the bubble and compare it with the observed hadronic cr spectrum with energies larger than @xmath36 ev .",
    "in section  [ sect : models ] , we suggest a model that can produce the cr spectrum within and beyond the `` knee '' ( around @xmath38 ev ) .",
    "summary and discussion is presented in section  [ sect : summary ] .",
    "from a general point of view , sn explosions are enough to supply the power needed for the luminosity of crs in our galaxy , @xmath39 erg s@xmath3 ( for a general review see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "diffusive shock acceleration ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is considered to be a viable and natural mechanism for cr accelerated by snrs .",
    "the mechanism produces a power - law spectrum with the necessary spectral index that is observed experimentally .",
    "the simplest one - dimensional kinetic equation describing this process has the form @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the coordinate perpendicular to the shock front , @xmath42 is the particle momentum , @xmath43 is the velocity distribution which describes a velocity jump at the shock , and @xmath44 is the spatial diffusion coefficient .",
    "the solution of this equation is a power - law function , @xmath45 , in which the spectral index @xmath46 is a function of the velocity jump at the shock . for strong shocks with a mach number much larger than unity , @xmath47 .",
    "the corresponding energy spectral index is @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) .    the current status of the observations of middle - aged snrs by lat on broad _ fermi _ with an energy range from @xmath50 to @xmath51 gev has provided some insight into the shock - acceleration theory of snrs @xcite . assuming the gamma rays are produced by hadronic processes",
    ", @xcite deduced the spectral index of four snrs ranging between @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "however , whether the observed gev gamma rays are produced by hadronic processes or leptonic processes is very difficult to differentiate . on the other hand",
    "the ambiguity can be removed if broadband emissions are observed . in particular",
    "if gev and tev spectra can be described by a single power law , which is steeper than @xmath54 , the hadronic processes could be the more favorable mechanisms .",
    "currently about 10 snrs have been detected in both gev and tev bands , including tycho and ctb37a , whose gev - tev gamma - ray emission shows uniformly steep spectral indices of about 2.3 and 2.2 , respectively ( see table 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "all these recent observations are consistent with conventional sn shock - acceleration theories , which suggest that the spectrum of crs is roughly described by @xmath54 .",
    "many fundamental questions related to the assumption that snrs are the sources of galactic crs are still open .",
    "the maximum energy of the accelerated particles is the main concern for this scenario , which can be roughly estimated from a very simple relation .",
    "the acceleration time at the shock is @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the shock velocity ( @xmath9 a few @xmath57 cm s@xmath3 ) .",
    "the minimum value of the diffusion coefficient at the shock follows from the bohm diffusion scenario , i.e. , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the larmor radius of the particle . equating the acceleration time with the lifetime of the shock @xmath60 we get an estimate for the maximum energy of accelerated particles after time @xmath60 , @xmath61 where @xmath62",
    ", @xmath63 is the magnetic field strength at the shock .",
    "the combination @xmath64 can be interpreted as an effective electric field .    for an snr of typical age @xmath65 yr",
    ", the maximum energy of protons is easily estimated by requiring that the acceleration time remain smaller than @xmath66 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite demonstrated that the maximum energy of protons within the scenario of bohm diffusion is as large as @xmath67-@xmath68 ev for standard galactic snrs .",
    "@xcite estimated the efficiency of acceleration when a feedback reaction of accelerated particles on the front structure was included and they showed that in the bohm limit crs absorb about 20% of the explosion energy .",
    "the acceleration process acts as an effective viscosity in widening the region of the shock velocity jump and eventually the acceleration process stops .",
    "however , outside the quasi - linear model the acceleration of crs at the shock fronts of snrs may make the acceleration of particles more effective .",
    "as @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) showed that during acceleration at shocks of snr , the magnetic non - resonant fluctuations were strongly driven .",
    "a nonlinear mhd simulation indicated that cr - excited turbulence could amplify the magnetic field .",
    "it appears that acceleration to the spectral break at @xmath36 ev normally ceases as an snr enters the sedov phase .",
    "thus , cr acceleration by sn shocks can only provide particles with energies less than @xmath36 ev .",
    "the spectral index of the observed cr flux changes from 2.7 to 3.1 around energy @xmath36 ev , and this is known as the knee .",
    "the standard model of cr acceleration by sn shocks can not explain cr energies above the knee , because it only produces a single power - law spectrum up to the energy around @xmath36 ev .",
    "in addition , the cr spectrum flattens again for energies above @xmath69 ev , and this is known as the ankle .",
    "large size is required to accelerate and to confine charged particles above the ankle ( the larmor radius at these energies is comparable with the halo height ) .",
    "the origin of crs above the ankle is generally attributed to an extragalactic origin because those particles could not be confined inside the galaxy and known potential galactic accelerators could hardly accelerate particles to such high energies .",
    "the origin of the steepening for @xmath70 ev is still an open question and different mechanisms of cr acceleration in the range @xmath36-@xmath69 ev in the galaxy have been proposed .",
    "@xcite assumed that the cr flux with energies above @xmath36 ev is produced by very young galactic snrs .",
    "they modeled the particle acceleration by spherical shocks with back - reaction of cr pressure on the shock structure .",
    "the significant magnetic field amplification in young snrs produced by cr streaming instability may lead to a flux of crs with the maximum energy of accelerated particles about @xmath71 ev . in this model ,",
    "the steepening of the cr spectrum at the knee position is due to distortion of the spectrum ejected from young snrs by the propagation process .",
    "another interpretation was suggested by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite who assumed that crs at the knee were produced by a single , recent local sn .",
    "recently @xcite summarized problems ( including energies within the knee ) of the conception that isolated snrs are the main accelerators of crs and discussed alternative scenarios of cr acceleration",
    ".    the steepening of the cr spectrum at high energies may also be the result of a change in properties of diffusion in the interstellar medium .",
    "this effect of propagation was mentioned first by @xcite who noticed that the standard diffusion of crs in the interstellar medium might be changed by convection due to a drift of these particles in the large - scale galactic magnetic fields .",
    "this model was developed in @xcite who assumed two types of cr diffusion in the galaxy : the usual diffusion due to particle scattering on fluctuations of random magnetic fields and the hall anisotropic diffusion ( drift motion ) due to the large - scale galactic magnetic field whose effect might become important just above the knee energy .    as an alternative model , @xcite suggested a mechanism of acceleration in the galaxy of ultra high energy crs in a galactic wind and its hypothetical termination shock . in this scenario ,",
    "snrs accelerate the bulk of crs up to @xmath36 ev .",
    "these particles are further accelerated up to @xmath72-@xmath73 ev at a termination shock which is at a distance of a few hundred kpc from the disk . @xcite",
    "analyzed multiple interactions of particles with snrs in the galactic disk as a source for cr acceleration above the knee .",
    "however , too many shocks are required in the disk in order to produce cr flux at the knee .",
    "@xcite showed that regions of cr acceleration to energies above @xmath36 ev might be ob associations where concentration of shock fronts is very high .",
    "we will discuss this model in section  [ sect : bubbleshock ] .    in summary",
    ", it is generally agreed that snr shocks can only accelerate particles to energies less than @xmath36 ev . on the other hand , accretion processes in the gc",
    "may generate giant shocks which are effective for particle acceleration above @xmath36 ev .",
    "it is interesting to note that the notion of recurrent activities in the galactic center as a source of cosmic rays has been proposed some 30 years ago @xcite , although not in the same perspective as the present paper .",
    "as was assumed in ccdki the central massive black hole captures a star every @xmath74 yr ; as a result , about @xmath75 erg of energy in the form of subrelativistic particles is released .",
    "this heats up the surrounding gas in the central region of our galaxy .",
    "the hot gas expands into the halo and forms a propagating upward shock .",
    "the situation is very similar to that of the stellar wind of a massive star blowing into its surrounding medium ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the gas distribution in the disk and in the halo was derived in @xcite and can be presented as a double exponential distribution @xmath76 \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\,0.2 \\exp\\left(- \\frac{z}{0.15\\,{\\rm kpc}}\\right)\\times \\exp\\left[-\\left ( \\frac{\\rho-4\\,{\\rm kpc}}{2\\,{\\rm kpc}}\\right)^2\\right ] \\ { \\rm cm}^{-3}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the energy release in the gc as a result of star capture can be either impulsive or continuous depending on the characteristic times of star capture and energy dissipation of subrelativistic protons ( plasma heating by coulomb losses ) .",
    "the capture time is roughly @xmath77 yr and the dissipation time @xmath78 in the ccdki model is determined by the rate of ionization losses of protons injected with energy @xmath79 , which is given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the gas density in the vicinity of the gc which can be quite high ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , e.g. , in nearby molecular clouds @xmath82 @xmath83 .    if @xmath84 we have the case of stationary energy injection in the gc . in this case",

    "this figure is meant to be illustrative only . in reality",
    "the distribution of shocks should be far more complicated . neglecting the thin 4 kpc torus component of equation  ( [ disk ] ) , the scale height of the `` atmosphere '' is @xmath106 kpc .",
    "the shock distribution in figure  [ fig : shape ] is suggestive of a cylindrical bubble with an edge at a radius @xmath107 kpc .",
    "based on this , we put forward a quasi - stationary model of the fermi bubble which we regard as the source of hadronic crs with energy larger than @xmath36 ev .",
    "the essence of the ccdki model is that energy is quasi - periodically injected into the halo when the stellar capture processes take place and may exist over a timescale comparable with the age of milky way .",
    "consequently , the fermi bubble should have a stationary structure .",
    "the idealized kompaneets solution above shows that there is a stationary sideway boundary for shocks . for quasi - periodic star capture",
    ", the bubble interior is filled with shocks propagating in series and eventually stopping at @xmath107 kpc . however , in the kompaneets solution dissipation processes are ignored .",
    "the realistic situation has to be described by a set of dissipative hydrodynamic equations , which takes account the shock propagation in a non - uniform medium and various dissipation processes , including shock heating , energy transfer into crs , slowing down due to accumulation of material , etc . fitting with the observed gamma - ray spectrum ,",
    "@xcite concluded that electrons should have an escape time scale of 15 myr in order to explain the spectral break position .",
    "the characteristic dissipation time scale of the shocks should be of the same order if these electrons are transported away by the shocks .",
    "the shocks will be mostly dissipated when they arrive at the sideway boundary ( @xmath108 ) and there will be no pile - up of shocks at @xmath108 . as the speed of shocks along the bubble axis is progressively larger than the sideway speed , the upper and lower boundaries of the bubble will be the same as the halo boundary ( @xmath109 kpc from the mid - plane ) .",
    "thus , the bubble has a stationary structure .",
    "the same result for the dimension of the bubble can be obtained if we use the swept - up mass model proposed by @xcite . in this model the radius of the sideway shock front or the swept - up front is given by @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the speed of the sideway shock front ( or the swept - up front ) and @xmath112 . with @xmath5 cm s@xmath3 , @xmath74 yr , @xmath113 pc .",

    "correct analysis of shock acceleration in the bubble requires sophisticated calculations in each stage of this process which we perform latter .",
    "now we present simple estimates of the characteristics of the spectra of the accelerated particle in the framework of the ccdki model .",
    "below we analyze the spectrum of protons accelerated in the bubble and discuss whether the bubble s contribution to the total flux of crs in the galaxy may explain the knee steepening .",
    "we remind the reader that the generally accepted point of view is that the flux of relatively low energy crs ( @xmath119 ev ) is generated by snrs , which eject a power - law spectrum @xmath54 into the interstellar medium .",
    "this spectrum is steepened by propagation ( escape ) processes in the galaxy in accordance with the spectrum observed near earth ( for details , see * ? ? ? * , section 6 ) .",
    "however these sources can hardly produce crs with energies @xmath120 ev , at which a steepening ( the knee ) in the cr spectrum is observed . for characteristics of the knee spectrum and models of its origin",
    "see the review of @xcite .",
    "we suggest that the bubble could generate the flux of crs at energies @xmath121 ev because the shocks in the bubble have much larger length scales and longer lifetimes in comparison with those in snrs .    in the framework of ccdki",

    "for the conditions of the fermi bubble the critical energy is @xmath132    in the case of @xmath133 or @xmath134 , the analysis in @xcite and @xcite showed that there is a combined effect of a fast particle acceleration by a single shock , which generates the spectrum @xmath54 and relatively slow transformation of this spectrum due to interaction with other shocks ( stochastic fermi acceleration ) into a hard @xmath135 spectrum in the intershock medium at relatively low energies .",
    "however , it is unclear if such slow transformation can be completed within the lifetime of the shocks in the bubble . a detailed numerical analysis is needed",
    "furthermore , from the general point of view the characteristic acceleration time is quite short in the range @xmath136 , which is roughly given by the shock acceleration time @xmath137 . in the range @xmath138 ,",

    "first , for @xmath163 , as expected from @xcite , particles that escape through the radial boundaries at @xmath164 are insignificant ( see * ? ? ? * , section 3 ) , and we can shift the halo boundary to infinity , i.e. , @xmath165 .",

    "we can see that these two distributions do not have a qualitative difference even if the ratios differ by a factor of 10 .",
    "in this section , we use the general models developed in the last section to fit the cr spectrum for @xmath218 ev but we ignore any possible spectral modulation effect as a result of propagation from the bubble to the earth . we have shown that the charged particles in the bubble can be described by a power - law spectrum , @xmath219 where @xmath129 is given by equation  ( [ e1 ] ) and @xmath220 , which can be expressed as @xmath221 for @xmath222 where @xmath223 is the high - energy cutoff and will be discussed below .",
    "we have used the momentum diffusion coefficient @xmath224 . here",
    "@xmath225 is a normalization constant which is chosen to fit the observed cr spectrum by assuming that the cr spectrum with energy @xmath218 ev is entirely contributed by particles from the bubble .",
    "@xmath223 can be estimated by equation  ( [ emax ] ) , which gives @xmath226 where @xmath60 is the time taken by a single shock propagating from the disk to the top of the bubble . however",
    ", this estimate assumes that particles are only accelerated by a single shock .",
    "as described in the previous section , the high - energy particles are accelerated by multiple shocks in the bubble ; in other words , particles can diffuse downward and continue to be accelerated by younger shocks in the lower part of the bubble .",
    "therefore @xmath227 myr is only a minimum lifetime , which means that the above estimate can be considered as the lower limit of @xmath223 .",
    "another possible way to restrict the maximum value of @xmath223 is when the larmor radius of the particles ( @xmath228 ) is larger than the radius of the bubble ( @xmath229 ) , @xmath230 in fact this estimate should be more appropriate for @xmath223 and we will use it in our model fitting process .    in our model particle spectrum",
    "there are four parameters : the lower cutoff @xmath129 ( equation  ( [ e1 ] ) ) , the upper cutoff @xmath223 ( equation  ( [ e2max ] ) ) , the spectral index @xmath231 ( equation  ( [ spectralindex ] ) ) , and the normalization @xmath232 ( equation  ( [ spectrum ] ) ) .",
    "we consider that @xmath233 pc , @xmath234 @xmath235 g , @xmath236 cm s@xmath3 and @xmath237 kpc are very reasonable mean values in the bubble , therefore in our model fitting we fix @xmath238 ev and @xmath239 ev . on the other hand , the conversion efficiency from the shock energy into particle energy and the mean diffusion coefficient @xmath240 in the bubble",
    "are the most uncertain parameters . therefore in our model",
    "fitting we treat these two parameters as fitting parameters .",
    "the solid line in figure  [ fig : flux ] indicates the best fit .",
    "the best fit gives @xmath241 , which corresponds to @xmath7 @xmath8 s@xmath3 .",
    "this is in agreement with the estimation @xmath160 if we take the average separation between shocks as @xmath242 pc ( see equation  ( [ l_shock ] ) ) .",
    "this seemingly large diffusion coefficient is in fact at least an order of magnitude smaller than the coefficient in the halo for @xmath243 ev .",
    "if the crs in the energy range @xmath36 ev @xmath244 ev arriving at the earth come from the bubble , then the power provided by the bubble for cr in this energy range is given by @xmath245 erg s@xmath3 , where @xmath246 is the observed cr energy flux and @xmath247 is the mean distance to the bubble .",
    "we find that the conversion efficient from shock power , @xmath248 erg s@xmath3 , is about 10% , which is consistent with recent estimation by using the _ fermi_-lat data @xcite .",
    "realistically , particles could escape from the bubble through various locations of the bubble s surface , where the local strength of the magnetic field may be different .",
    "in addition , we have pointed out that there are two possible ways to estimate the value of @xmath223 ( equations  ( [ e2min ] ) and ( [ e2max ] ) ) .",
    "therefore it is likely that @xmath129 and @xmath223 should have some distribution coming out from the bubble . in the dotted line in figure  [ fig : flux ]",
    "we keep the spectral index as that of the solid line but assume that @xmath129 and @xmath223 have a uniform distribution between @xmath249 ev @xmath250 ev ( which corresponds to 1 @xmath235 g @xmath251 10 @xmath235 g ) and @xmath252 , respectively .",
    "we can see that the model curve starts to drop around @xmath253 ev and matches the data better .",
    "furthermore , we have argued that the injected spectrum from the shock is @xmath54 for @xmath254 and slowly becomes harder for @xmath135 due to interactions with multiple shocks after a sufficiently long time .",
    "however , it is unclear if this spectral hardening process can be completed within the finite lifetime of the particles in the bubble ( see section  [ sect : bubbleshock ] for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "therefore we can not predict the exact spectral index for @xmath254 . for reference purposes , in figure  [ fig : flux ]",
    "we show these two possibilities : the dashed line for @xmath54 and the dash - dotted line for @xmath135 , respectively .",
    "both @xmath129 and @xmath223 of these two lines also assume uniform distributions .",
    "the observed high - energy cr spectrum is a broken power law .",
    "the energy spectral index for cr energy smaller than the knee ( around @xmath38 ev ) is 2.7",
    ". the index increases to 3.1 for larger energy ( until around @xmath72 ev where the spectrum becomes harder again ) .",
    "the general argument is that the sources ( i.e. , acceleration mechanisms and/or sites ) responsible for the energy range within and beyond the knee should be different .",
    "the intriguing fact is that the two power laws match quite well at the knee .",
    "this coincident problem is difficult to solve if the two sources are totally unrelated .",
    "crs within ( i.e. , energy less than ) the knee are generally attributed to snrs in our galaxy ( see section  [ sect : snr ] ) . in the previous two sections , we alluded to the acceleration site of crs beyond the knee ( i.e. , energy larger than the knee ) to the fermi bubble . in section  [",
    "sect : bubbleshock ] , we studied equation  ( [ dif_bubble ] ) without a source in the bubble .",
    "the solution gave the characteristic spectrum of the system .",
    "in reality we need a source or a seed population for the bubble .",
    "we deem that we do not need a new seed population for bubble acceleration .",
    "instead we propose the following model : some of the crs produced by snrs in the galactic disk are re - accelerated in the bubble to energy beyond the knee .",
    "this model has the potential to solve the coincident problem naturally , because the source of crs beyond the knee is seeded by the source within the knee .",
    "to consolidate our idea , we work out a concrete numerical model . essentially , we solve the stationary state cr transport equation  ( [ dif_bubble ] ) in our galaxy with two fermi bubbles ( one on each side of the galactic plane ) .",
    "we modeled our galactic halo as a cylinder of radius @xmath255 kpc , and the top and bottom at @xmath256 kpc from the mid - plane .",
    "each fermi bubble is also a cylinder of the same height @xmath256 kpc , but with a radius @xmath257 kpc .",
    "the fermi bubbles are filled with shocks as described in section  [ sect : structure ] ( see figure  [ fig : shape ] ) .",

    "according to the analysis in section  [ sect : bubbleshock ] , the acceleration of energetic particles in the bubble is facilitated by stochastic acceleration ( second - order fermi acceleration ) . assuming that there is little or no stochastic acceleration outside the bubble , we model the momentum diffusion coefficient as a step function as in equation  ( [ diffusioncoeff ] ) and adopt @xmath261 ( i.e. , @xmath262 s@xmath3 or the corresponding acceleration time scale is @xmath263 myr ) .",
    "the galactic disk contains snrs .",
    "we adopt the distribution suggested by @xcite and modified it with a gaussian thickness profile @xmath264 where @xmath150 is the galactocentric radius and @xmath41 is the distance perpendicular to the mid - plane . here",

    "we adopt the idea that snrs inject energetic particles in the form of a power law with a high - energy cutoff at @xmath267 ev .",
    "therefore , together with the snr distribution ( equation  ( [ snrdist ] ) ) , the source function is @xmath268    as mentioned in section  [ sect : snr ] , we take the snr injection spectrum to be @xmath269 ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "we point out that the spatial distributions of seed and re - accelerated crs in the disk are quite different . in principle ,",
    "cr distribution can be derived from gamma - ray data .",

    "we have summarized our current understanding of the origin of crs .",
    "it is generally believed that most cr power can be provided by snrs . however",
    "the crs with energies @xmath218 ev are quite difficult to achieve in sne due to the limited acceleration time and energy content in sn shocks . on the other hand",
    ", we argue that shocks in the fermi bubble produced by stellar capture events can have a much longer lifetime @xmath286 yr and larger energy content @xmath287 erg , which allow them to produce crs with energies @xmath218 ev .",
    "if processes of crs which escape from the galaxy are taken into account , the predicted cr spectrum contributed by the bubble is @xmath288 , where @xmath289 for @xmath36 ev @xmath290 ev .",
    "however , it is very difficult to predict the exact value of the spectral index @xmath231 due to the poorly measured value of the diffusion coefficient in the bubble .",

    "after being re - accelerated inside the bubbles by the multiple shocks , protons ( and nuclei ) escape the bubbles .",
    "the lifetime of protons by pp collision is of the order of @xmath293 yr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "once they leave the acceleration site ( i.e. , fermi bubbles ) , they lose most of their energy within a short distance ( less than 1 kpc ) . hence the electrons are mostly confined in the bubbles .",

    "<S> the _ fermi _ large area telescope has recently discovered two giant gamma - ray bubbles which extend north and south of the galactic center with diameters and heights of the order of @xmath0 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the periodic star capture processes by the galactic supermassive black hole sgr a@xmath1 , with a capture rate of @xmath2 yr@xmath3 and an energy release of @xmath4 erg per capture , can result in hot plasma injecting into the galactic halo at a wind velocity of @xmath5 cm s@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the periodic injection of hot plasma can produce a series of shocks . </S>",
    "<S> energetic protons in the bubble are re - accelerated when they interact with these shocks . </S>",
    "<S> we show that for energy larger than @xmath6 ev , the acceleration process can be better described by the stochastic second - order fermi acceleration .    </S>",
    "<S> we propose that hadronic cosmic rays ( crs ) within the `` knee '' of the observed cr spectrum are produced by galactic supernova remnants distributed in the galactic disk . </S>",
    "<S> re - acceleration of these particles in the fermi bubble produces crs beyond the knee . with a mean cr diffusion coefficient in this energy range in the bubble @xmath7 @xmath8 s@xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> , we can reproduce the spectral index of the spectrum beyond the knee and within . </S>",
    "<S> the conversion efficiency from shock energy of the bubble into cr energy is about 10% . </S>",
    "<S> this model provides a natural explanation of the observed cr flux , spectral indices , and matching of spectra at the knee . </S>"
