    "the definition and study of spaces of plane shapes has recently met a large amount of interest @xcite , and has important applications , in object recognition , for the analysis of shape databases or in medical imaging .",
    "the theoretical background involves the construction of infinite dimensional manifolds of shapes @xcite .",
    "the riemannian framework , in particular , is appealing , because it provides shape spaces with a rich structure which is also useful for applications .",
    "a general discussion of several classes of metrics that can be introduced for this purpose can be found in @xcite .",
    "the present paper focuses on a particular riemannian metric that has very specific properties .",
    "this metric , which will be described in the next section , can be seen as a limit case of one of the classes studied in @xcite , and would receive the label @xmath0 in the nomenclature introduced therein .",
    "one of its surprising properties is that it can be characterized as a image of a grassmann manifold by a suitably chosen riemannian submersion .",
    "a consequence of this is the possibility to derive explicit geodesics in this shape space .",
    "a precursor of the @xmath0 metric has been introduced in @xcite and studied in the context of open plane curves .",
    "it has also recently been used in @xcite .",
    "because the metric is placed on curves modulo changes of parametrization , the computation of geodesics naturally provides an elastic matching algorithm .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first provide the definitions and notation that we will use for spaces of curves , the @xmath1 metric and the classical manifolds that will be shown to be isometric to it .",
    "we then study some local properties of the obtained manifold , discussing in particular its geodesics and sectional curvature .",
    "we finally provide experimental results for the numerical computation of geodesics and the solution of the related elastic matching problem .",
    "throughout this paper , we will assume our plane curves are curves in the _ complex _ plane @xmath2 .",
    "then real inner products and @xmath3 determinants of real 2-vectors are given by @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we first recall the notations for various spaces of plane curves which we will need , some of which were introduced in the previous paper @xcite . for all questions about infinite dimensional analysis and differential geometry",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "by @xmath6,\\mathbb c)\\ ] ] we denote the space of @xmath7-immersions @xmath8 \\rightarrow \\mathbb c$ ]",
    ". here ` @xmath9 ' stands for _ open curve_. @xmath10 is the quotient of @xmath11 by the group @xmath12)$ ] of @xmath7 increasing diffeomorphisms of @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "next @xmath14 are the spaces of @xmath7-immersions @xmath15 of _ even _ , respectively _",
    "odd _ rotation degree . here , @xmath16 is the unit circle in @xmath2 , which will be identified in this paper to @xmath17 .",
    "then @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the quotients of @xmath20 , respectively @xmath21 by the group @xmath22 of @xmath7 orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of @xmath16 .",
    "for example , @xmath19 contains the simple closed plane curves , since they have index + 1 or @xmath23 ( depending on how they are oriented ) .",
    "these are the main focus of this study . to save us from enumerating special cases",
    ", we will often consider open curves as defined on @xmath16 but with a possible discontinuity at 0 .",
    "we will also consider the quotients of these spaces by the group of translations , by the group of translations and rotations and the group of translations , rotations and scalings .",
    "using the notation of @xcite , we can introduce the basic metric studied in this paper on these three spaces of immersions , but _",
    "modulo translations _ , as follows .",
    "identify @xmath24 with the set of vector fields @xmath25 along @xmath26 modulo constant vector fields .",
    "then we consider the limiting case of the scale invariant metric of sobolev order 1 from @xcite ,  4.8 : @xmath27 where , as in @xcite , @xmath28 is arclength measure , @xmath29 is the derivative with respect to arc length , and @xmath30 is the length of @xmath26 .",
    "we also recall for later use the notation @xmath31 for the unit tangent vector , and , as multiplication by @xmath32 is rotation by 90 degrees , @xmath33 for the unit normal .",
    "note that this metric is invariant with respect to reparametrizations of the curve @xmath26 , hence it induces a metric which we also call @xmath34 on the quotient spaces @xmath35 and @xmath19 also modulo translations .",
    "the geodesic equation in all these metrics is a simple limiting case of those worked out in @xcite .",
    "suppose @xmath36 is a geodesic .",
    "then : @xmath37 here the bar indicates the _ average _ of the quantity over the curve @xmath26 , i.e.  @xmath38 .",
    "unfortunately , this case was not worked out in @xcite , hence we give the details of its derivation in appendix i. the local existence and uniqueness of solutions to this equations can be proved easily , essentially because of the regularizing influence of the term @xmath39 .",
    "this will also follow from the explicit representation of these geodesics to be given below , but because of its more general applicability , we give a direct proof in appendix i.    it is convenient to introduce the _ momentum _",
    "@xmath40 associated to a geodesic . using the momentum ,",
    "the geodesic equation is easily rewritten in the more compact form : @xmath41 are nothing more than _ horizontal _ geodesics in @xmath42 , that is geodesics which are perpendicular at one hence all points to the orbit of the group of reparametrizations . as is shown in @xcite , horizontality is equivalent to the condition @xmath43 for some scalar function @xmath44 . substituting @xmath43 and taking the @xmath45-component of the last equation , we find that horizontal geodesics are given by : @xmath46    there are several conserved momenta along each geodesic @xmath47 of this metric ( see @xcite ,  4.8 ) : the ` reparametrization ' momentum is @xmath48 which vanishes along all horizontal geodesics .",
    "the translation momentum vanishes because the metric does not feel translation ( constant vector fields along @xmath26 ) .",
    "the angular momentum is @xmath49 since the metric invariant under scalings , we also have the scaling momentum @xmath50 so we may equivalently consider either the quotient space @xmath51 or consider the section of the translation action @xmath52 . in the same way , we may either pass modulo scalings or consider the section by fixing @xmath53 , since the scaling momentum vanishes here . finally , in some cases , we will pass modulo rotations .",
    "we could consider the section where angular momentum vanishes : but this latter is not especially simple",
    "we introduce the three function spaces : @xmath54 \\rightarrow \\mathbb r \\\\ v_{\\ev } & = \\text{vector space of all } c^\\infty \\text { mappings }   f : s^1 \\rightarrow \\mathbb r \\text { such that } f(\\th+2\\pi )   \\equiv f(\\th)\\\\ v_{\\od } & = \\text{vector space of all } c^\\infty \\text { mappings }   f : s^1 \\rightarrow \\mathbb r \\text { such that } f(\\th+2\\pi )   \\equiv -f(\\th)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] all three spaces have the weak inner product : @xmath55 given @xmath56 from any of these spaces , the basic map is : @xmath57 the map @xmath26 so defined carries @xmath13 $ ] or @xmath16 to @xmath2 . it need not be an immersion , however , because @xmath58 and @xmath59 might vanish simultaneously .",
    "define @xmath60 then we get three maps : @xmath61    looking separately at the three cases , define first the sphere @xmath62 to be the set of @xmath63 such that @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath65 is defined as the subset where @xmath66 .",
    "then the magic of the map @xmath67 is shown by the following key fact @xcite :    @xmath67 defines a map : @xmath68 which is an isometric 2-fold covering , using the natural metric on @xmath69 and the metric @xmath70 on @xmath71 .",
    "proof the mapping @xmath67 is surjective : given @xmath72 with @xmath73 and @xmath53 , we write @xmath74",
    ". then we may choose @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "since @xmath77 we see that @xmath78 .",
    "the only choice here is the sign of the square root , i.e.   @xmath79 , thus @xmath67 is 2:1 .    to see that @xmath67 is an isometry ,",
    "let @xmath80 and @xmath81",
    ". then the differential @xmath82 is given by @xmath83 we have @xmath84 .",
    "this implies first that @xmath85 as required .",
    "then : @xmath86    the dictionary between pairs @xmath87 and immersions @xmath26 connects many properties of each with those of the other .",
    "curvature @xmath88 works out especially nicely .",
    "we list here some of the connections : @xmath89 and if @xmath90 is the wronskian , then : @xmath91      since geodesics on a sphere are always given by great circles , this theorem gives us the first case of explicit geodesics on spaces of curves in the metric of this paper .",
    "however , note that great circles in the open part @xmath92 are susceptible to crossing the ` bad ' part @xmath93 somewhere .",
    "this occurs if and only if there exists @xmath94 such that @xmath95 and @xmath96 have identical complex arguments modulo @xmath97 .",
    "so we find that our metric on @xmath42 is _",
    "incomplete_.    we can form a commutative diagram : @xmath98 ^ -{\\text{2-fold } } \\ar@{^{(}->}[d ] & \\on{imm}_{\\op}\\big/ \\left ( \\text { transl , scalings } \\right ) \\ar@{^{(}->}[d ] \\qquad \\\\    \\widetilde{\\ph } : \\onb{s}(v_\\op ) \\ ;   \\ar[r ] & c^{\\infty}([0,2\\pi],\\mathbb c ) \\big/ \\left ( \\text{transl , scalings}\\right)}\\ ] ] where we have denoted the extended @xmath67 by @xmath99 . for rather technical reasons",
    "@xmath99 is not surjective : there are pathological non - negative @xmath7 functions which have no @xmath7 square root , see @xcite , e.g. but what this diagram does do is give some space of maps to hold the extended geodesics .",
    "the example : @xmath100 is shown in figure [ fig : genbifurc ] .",
    "this is a geodesic in which all curves are immersions for @xmath101 , but @xmath102 has a double zero at @xmath103 .    the generic way in which a family of open immersions crosses the hypersurface where @xmath104 .",
    "the parametrized straight line in the middle of the family has velocity with a double zero at the black dot , hence is not an immersion .",
    "see text.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=70.0% ] +      next , consider the periodic cases . here",
    "we need the _ stiefel manifolds _ : @xmath105 and @xmath106 the subset defined by the constraint @xmath66 . for later use ,",
    "it is also convenient to note that @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the space of linear maps from @xmath2 to @xmath109 and @xmath110 . for @xmath111 , when is @xmath112 periodic ?",
    "if and only if we have : @xmath113 condition says that @xmath114 ( since the sum is 2 ) and @xmath115 , so that @xmath116 or @xmath117 . recall that the index @xmath45 of an immersed curve @xmath26 is defined by considering @xmath118 .",
    "the log must satisfy @xmath119 for some @xmath45 and this is the index .",
    "so this index is even or odd depending on whether the square root of @xmath120 is periodic or anti - periodic , that whether @xmath121 or @xmath122 .",
    "so if @xmath67 is restricted to @xmath123 or @xmath124 ( and is still denoted @xmath67 ) , it provides isometric 2-fold coverings @xmath125    all three of these maps @xmath67 can be modified so as to divide out by rotations .",
    "the mapping @xmath126 produces a rotation of the immersed curve @xmath127 through an angle @xmath128 .",
    "the complex projective space @xmath129 is @xmath130 divided by the action of rotations , and we denote by @xmath131 the subset gotten by dividing @xmath132 by rotations . the group generated by translations , rotations and scalings will be called the group of _ similitudes _ , abreviated as ` sim ' . then we get the variant : @xmath133    similarly , let @xmath134 be the grassmannian of unoriented 2-dimensional subspaces of @xmath109 and let @xmath135 be the subset of those @xmath136 with @xmath137 for @xmath138 or @xmath139",
    ". then we have maps : @xmath140    for later use , we describe the tangent spaces of these spaces .",
    "the tangent space @xmath141 to @xmath134 at @xmath142 is naturally identified with @xmath143 and has the following norm , induced from that on @xmath109 : @xmath144 for @xmath145 and @xmath146 an orthonormal basis of @xmath136 .",
    "similarly , @xmath147 can be naturally identified with pairs @xmath148 in @xmath109 such that @xmath149 with norm : @xmath150 the same definition holds for @xmath151 , this time with the constraint @xmath152 .",

    "the infinitesimal action of a vector field @xmath165 on @xmath13 $ ] or a periodic vector field @xmath165 on @xmath16 is then @xmath166    for all three sets of isometries",
    "@xmath67 , we can now divide each side by the reparametrization group @xmath163 . for open curves ,",
    "we get a diagram @xmath167 ^ -{\\text{2-fold } } \\ar[d ] & b_{i,\\op}\\big/ \\left ( \\text { transl , scalings } \\right ) \\ar[d ] \\quad\\\\    \\overline{\\ph } : \\onb{cp}^0(v^2_\\op)/u(v_\\op ) \\ ;   \\ar[r]^-{\\approx } & b_{i,\\op } \\big/ \\left(\\text{sim}\\right)}\\ ] ] and a similar one for closed curves of even and odd index where @xmath168 and @xmath169 : @xmath170 ^ -{\\text{2-fold } } \\ar[d ] & b \\big/ \\left ( \\text{transl , scalings}\\right ) \\ar[d]\\qquad\\\\    \\overline{\\ph } : \\onb{gr}^0(2,v)/u(v ) \\ ;   \\ar[r]^-\\approx   & b \\big/ \\left(\\text{sim}\\right)}\\ ] ]    here we have divided by isometries on both the left and right : by @xmath163 or @xmath171 on the left ( where @xmath16 rotates the basis @xmath146 ) and by reparametrizations and rotations on the right . thus @xmath172 is again an isometry if we make both quotients into riemannian submersions .",
    "this means we must identify the tangent spaces to the quotients with the _ horizontal _ subspaces of the tangent spaces in the larger space , i.e. those perpendicular to the orbits of the isometric group actions . for @xmath173 ,",
    "this means :    [ horizontalinst ] the tangent vector @xmath148 to @xmath173 satisfies : @xmath174 it is horizontal for the rotation action if and only if : @xmath175 it is horizontal for the reparametrization group if : @xmath176 where @xmath177 is the wronskian with respect to the parameter @xmath94 .",
    "proof consider the action of rotations , which is one - dimensional , with orbits @xmath178 ; the direction at @xmath87 is chosen as @xmath179 .",
    "so @xmath180 being horizontal at @xmath87 for this action means that @xmath181 .",
    "this proves the first assertion .    for the action of @xmath163",
    ", one has to note that horizontal vectors must satisfy @xmath182 for any periodic vector field @xmath165 on @xmath183 , which yields the horizontality condition after integration by parts of the terms in @xmath184 .",
    "horizontality on the shape space side means ( see @xcite ) :    @xmath185 is horizontal for the action of @xmath186 if and only if @xmath187 is normal to the curve , i.e. @xmath188 .    for any smooth path @xmath26 in @xmath189 there exists a smooth path @xmath154 in @xmath186 with @xmath190 depending smoothly on @xmath26 such that the path @xmath58 given by @xmath191 is horizontal : @xmath192 .",
    "this is a variant of @xcite .",
    "proof writing @xmath193 instead of @xmath194 we note that @xmath195 for @xmath196 .",
    "so we have @xmath197 .",
    "let us write @xmath198 for @xmath191 , etc .",
    "we look for @xmath154 as the integral curve of a time dependent vector field @xmath199 on @xmath16 , given by @xmath200 .",
    "we want the following expression to vanish : @xmath201 using the time dependent vector field @xmath202 and its flow @xmath154 achieves this .",
    "as we will see below , we can describe geodesics in the ` classical ' spaces @xmath203 quite explicitly . by the above isometries",
    ", this gives us the geodesics in the various spaces @xmath204 .",
    "but , as we mentioned above for the space @xmath69 , geodesics in the ` good ' parts @xmath205 do not stay there , but they cross the ` bad ' part where @xmath206 .",
    "now the basic mapping is still defined on the full sphere , projective space , stiefel manifold or grassmannian , giving us some smooth mappings of @xmath13 $ ] or @xmath16 to @xmath2 , possibly modulo translations , rotations and/or scalings .",
    "but when we divide by @xmath207 , a major problem arises .",
    "the orbits of @xmath207 acting on @xmath208,\\mathbb c)$ ] are not closed , hence the topological quotient of the space @xmath208,\\mathbb c)$ ] by @xmath207 is _ not hausdorff_. this is shown by the following construction :    1 .",
    "start with a @xmath7 non - decreasing map @xmath209 from @xmath13 $ ] to itself such that @xmath210 for @xmath94 in some interval @xmath211 .",
    "2 .   let @xmath212 .",
    "the sequence @xmath213 of diffeomorphisms of @xmath13 $ ] converges to @xmath209 .",
    "3 .   then for any @xmath214",
    ", the maps @xmath215 are all in the orbit of @xmath26 .",
    "but they converge to @xmath216 which is constant on the whole interval @xmath211 , hence is not in the orbit .",
    "thus , if we want some hausdorff space of curves which a ) have singularities more complex than those of immersed curves and b ) can hold the extensions of geodesics in some space @xmath217 which come from the map @xmath67 , we must divide @xmath208 , \\mathbb c)$ ] by some equivalence relation larger than the group action by @xmath163 .",
    "the simplest seems to be : first define a _ monotone relation _ @xmath218\\times [ 0,2\\pi]$ ] to be any closed subset such that @xmath219 $ ] ( @xmath220 and @xmath221 being the projections on the axes ) and for every pair of points @xmath222 and @xmath223 , either @xmath224 and @xmath225 or vice versa",
    ". then @xmath226 \\rightarrow \\mathbb c$ ] are _ frchet _ equivalent if there is a monotone relation @xmath227 such that @xmath228 .",
    "this is a good equivalence relation because if @xmath229 \\rightarrow \\mathbb c$ ] are two sequences and @xmath230 and @xmath231 are frchet equivalent for all @xmath45 , then @xmath232 are frchet equivalent .",
    "the essential point is that the set of non - empty closed subsets of a compact metric space @xmath165 is compact in the hausdorff topology ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus if @xmath233 are the monotone relations instantiating the equivalence of @xmath234 and @xmath235 , a subsequence @xmath236 hausdorff converges to some @xmath218 \\times [ 0,2\\pi]$ ] and it is immediate that @xmath227 is a monotone relation making @xmath59 and @xmath237 frchet equivalent .",
    "define @xmath238,\\mathbb c)/ \\text{fr\\'echet equivalence , translations , scalings}.\\ ] ] then we have a commutative diagram : @xmath98 \\ar@{^{(}->}[d ] & b_{i,\\op}\\big/ \\left ( \\text{transl , scalings } \\right )   \\ar@{^{(}->}[d ] \\qquad \\\\    \\widetilde{\\ph } : \\onb{s}(v^2_\\op )   \\ ; \\ar[r ] & b_{big,\\op}}\\ ] ] thus the whole of a geodesic which enters the ` bad ' part of @xmath239 creates a path in @xmath240 .",
    "of course , the same construction works for closed curves also .",
    "we will see several examples in the next section .",
    "the space @xmath241 being the sphere of radius @xmath242 on @xmath243 , its geodesics are the great circles .",
    "thus , the geodesic distance between @xmath244 and @xmath245 is given by @xmath246 with @xmath247 and the geodesic is given by @xmath248 the corresponding geodesic on @xmath71 modulo translation and scaling is the time - indexed family of curves @xmath249 with @xmath250    the following notation will be used throughout this section : @xmath251 so that @xmath252 and @xmath253 for @xmath254 .",
    "thus the distance @xmath255 is @xmath256 the metric on @xmath71 modulo rotations is @xmath257    the distance on @xmath10 is the infimum of this expression over all changes of coordinate for @xmath258 . assuming that @xmath258 and @xmath259 are originally parametrized with @xmath260 times arc - length so that @xmath261 , this is @xmath262 and modulo rotations @xmath263 the supremum in both expressions",
    "is taken over all increasing bijections @xmath264 , [ 0 , 2\\pi])$ ] .    to shorten these formulae",
    ", we will use the following notation .",
    "define : @xmath265 then we have : @xmath266      these expressions give very explicit descriptions of distance and geodesics .",
    "we have already noted , however , that , even if both @xmath244 and @xmath245 belong to @xmath92 , the same property is not guaranteed at each point of the geodesic .",
    "@xmath267 happens for some @xmath268 whenever @xmath269 and @xmath270 are collinear with opposite orientations .",
    "this is not likely to happen for geodesics joining nearby points .",
    "when it does happen , it is usually a stable phenomenon : for example , if the geodesic crosses @xmath93 transversally , as illustrated in figure [ fig : genbifurc ] , then this happens for all nearby geodesics too .",
    "note that this means that the geodesic spray on @xmath11 is _ not _ surjective .",
    "in fact , any geodesic on @xmath11 comes from a great circle on @xmath271 and if it crosses @xmath93 , it leaves @xmath11 .",
    "when we pass to the quotient by reparametrizations , another question arises : does the inf over reparametrizations exist ? or equivalently is there is a _ horizontal _ geodesic joining any two open curves ?",
    "in fact , there need not be any such geodesic even if you allow it to cross @xmath93 . in general , to obtain a geodesic minimizing distance between 2 open curves , the curves themselves must be given parametrizations with zero velocity somewhere , i.e.they may need to be lifted to points in @xmath93 .",
    "this is best illustrated by the special case in which @xmath259 is the line segment from @xmath272 to @xmath273 , namely @xmath274 , @xmath275 .",
    "the curve @xmath258 can be arbitrary .",
    "then the reparametrization @xmath276 which minimizes distance is the one which maximizes : @xmath277 this variational problem is easy to solve : the optimal @xmath276 is given by : @xmath278 note that @xmath276 is _ not _ in general a diffeomorphism : it is constant on intervals where @xmath279 .",
    "its graph is a monotone relation in the sense of section [ sec : bigger ] .",
    "in fact , it s easy to see that monotone relations enjoy a certain compactness , so that the inf over reparametrizations is always achieved by a monotone relation .",
    "assuming @xmath280 is represented by a continuous function for which @xmath281 , the result is that the places on the curve @xmath258 where @xmath282 get squashed to points on the line segment .",
    "the result is that this limit geodesic is not actually a path in the space @xmath283 of smooth curves .",
    "figure [ fig : badinf ] illustrates this effect .",
    "the general problem of maximizing the functional @xmath284 with respect to increasing functions @xmath276 has been addressed in @xcite .",
    "existence of solutions can be shown in the class of monotone relations , or , equivalently functions @xmath276 that take the form @xmath285 for some positive measure @xmath286 on @xmath287 $ ] with total mass less or equal to @xmath288 ( @xmath289 being replaced by the radon - nykodim derivative of @xmath286 in the definition of @xmath290 ) .",
    "the optimal @xmath276 is a diffeomorphism as soon as @xmath291 whenever @xmath292 is smaller than a constant ( which depends on @xmath280 and @xmath293 ) .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "it is easy to show that maximizing @xmath290 is equivalent to maximizing @xmath294 because one can always modify @xmath276 on intervals on which @xmath295 to ensure that @xmath296 . in @xcite , it is proposed to maximize @xmath297 this corresponds to replacing the lift @xmath298 by @xmath299 where @xmath300 for all @xmath301 , but this is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "this is a geodesic of open curves running from the curve with the kink at the top left to the straight line on the bottom right .",
    "a blow up of the next to last curve is shown to reveal that the kink never goes away  it merely shrinks .",

    "we use the method of @xcite for the space @xmath650 which is an open subset in a frchet space , with tangent space @xmath651 .",
    "we shall use the following conventions and results from @xcite : @xmath652 then the derivative of the metric at @xmath26 in direction @xmath653 is : @xmath654 according to @xcite we should rewrite this as @xmath655 and thus we find the two versions @xmath656 and @xmath466 of the @xmath34-gradient of @xmath657 : @xmath658 which gives us the geodesic equation by @xcite : @xmath659    [ existenceg ] for each @xmath660 the geodesic equation derived in [ geodesicimm ] has unique local solutions in the sobolev space of @xmath661-immersions . the solutions depend @xmath7 on @xmath268 and on the initial conditions @xmath662 and @xmath663 .",
    "the domain of existence ( in @xmath268 ) is uniform in @xmath412 and thus this also holds in @xmath664 .",
    "proof the proof is very similar to the one of @xcite .",
    "we denote by @xmath665 any space of based loops @xmath666 .",
    "we consider the geodesic equation as the flow equation of a smooth ( @xmath7 ) vector field on the @xmath667-open set @xmath668 in the sobolev space @xmath669 where @xmath670 is @xmath667-open .",
    "to see that this works we will use the following facts : by the sobolev inequality we have a bounded linear embedding @xmath671 if @xmath672 . the sobolev space",
    "@xmath673 is a banach algebra under pointwise multiplication if @xmath674 . for any fixed smooth mapping @xmath59",
    "the mapping @xmath675 is smooth @xmath676 if @xmath677 .",
    "we write @xmath678 just for the remainder of this proof to stress the dependence on @xmath26 .",
    "the mapping @xmath679 is smooth @xmath680 and is a bibounded linear isomorphism @xmath681 for fixed @xmath26 .",
    "this can be seen as follows ( compare with @xcite ) : it is true if @xmath26 is parametrized by arclength ( look at it in the space of fourier coefficients ) .",
    "the index is invariant under continuous deformations of elliptic operators of fixed degree , so the index of @xmath682 is zero in general .",
    "but @xmath682 is self - adjoint positive , so it is injective with vanishing index , thus surjective . by the open mapping theorem it is then bibounded .",
    "moreover @xmath683 is smooth @xmath684 ( by the inverse function theorem on banach spaces ) .",
    "the mapping @xmath685 is smooth @xmath686 for @xmath687 , and is linear in @xmath59 .",
    "we have @xmath688 and @xmath689 .",
    "the mapping @xmath690 is smooth on the @xmath667-open set @xmath691 into @xmath692 . keeping all this in mind we now write the geodesic equation as follows :",
    "here we used that along any geodesic the norm @xmath694 and the scaling momentum @xmath695 are both constant in @xmath268 . now a term by term investigation shows that the expression in the brackets is smooth @xmath696 since @xmath697 .",
    "the operator @xmath698 then takes it smoothly back to @xmath699 .",
    "so the vector field @xmath700 is smooth on @xmath701 .",
    "thus the flow @xmath702 exists on @xmath699 and is smooth in @xmath268 and the initial conditions for fixed @xmath412 .",
    "now we consider smooth initial conditions @xmath703 and @xmath704 in @xmath705 .",
    "suppose the trajectory @xmath706 of @xmath165 through these intial conditions in @xmath699 maximally exists for @xmath707 , and the trajectory @xmath708 in @xmath709 maximally exists for @xmath710 with @xmath711 . by uniqueness",
    "we have @xmath712 for @xmath713 .",
    "we now apply @xmath714 to the equation @xmath715 , note that the commutator @xmath716 $ ] is a pseudo differential operator of order @xmath717 again , and write @xmath718 .",
    "we obtain @xmath719(\\,\\dots\\ , ) + \\text{const}.w$ ] . in the term",
    "@xmath720 we consider now only the terms @xmath721 and rename them @xmath722 .",
    "then we get an equation @xmath723 which is inhomogeneous bounded linear in @xmath724 with coefficients bounded linear operators on @xmath699 which are @xmath7 functions of @xmath725 . these we already know on the intervall @xmath726 .",
    "this equation therefore has a solution @xmath727 for all @xmath268 for which the coefficients exists , thus for all @xmath728 .",
    "the limit @xmath729 exists in @xmath699 and by continuity it equals @xmath730 in @xmath699 at @xmath731 .",
    "thus the @xmath709-flow was not maximal and can be continued .",
    "so @xmath732 . we can iterate this and conclude that the flow of @xmath165 exists in @xmath733 ."
