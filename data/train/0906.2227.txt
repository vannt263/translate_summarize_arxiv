    "spatially unresolved observations of the infrared and mm - wave emission from nearby pre - main sequence stars surrounded by disks suggest that most of the circumstellar dust dissipates on timescales between 1 and 10 myr ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , it remains very uncertain how disk evolution proceeds in individual systems and , in particular , whether all circumstellar disks give rise to planetary systems . over the last ten years a large number of circumstellar disks in nearby star forming regions have been observed using long baseline millimeter and sub - millimeter interferometers .",
    "these observations have spatially resolved the disk emission to infer the radial distribution of gas and dust . however , at the distance of the nearby star forming regions ( 100 - 200 pc ) , the typical angular resolution of 1.5 - 3   @xcite could not constrain the detailed structure of disks , which typically have radii of only a few hundred au .",
    "higher angular resolution mm - wave observations remain challenging and the number of disks observed at angular resolution higher than 1   is still very small and essentially restricted to more massive and luminous pre - main sequence circumstellar disks such as lkh@xmath0  330 @xcite , hd  163296 @xcite , ab  aur , mwc  480 , dm  tau and lkca  15 @xcite , cq  tau @xcite , dl  tau , uz  tau , bp  tau and gm  aur @xcite , tw  hya @xcite and gg  tau @xcite .",
    "even for this small sample the radial distribution and kinematics of the circumstellar material vary considerably from object to object .",
    "since the observed objects are characterized by stellar ages between @xmath90.1 and @xmath910  myr , which is probably a considerable fraction of the disk life time , variations in the dust properties may also be representative of different evolutionary stages .",
    "differences in disk structure are believed to result from variation in the total angular momenta , masses , chemical compositions and magnetic fields , during the collapse of the parent molecular core ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "disk structure in multiple systems or in dense star forming regions can also be influenced by the dynamical perturbation induced by close - by companions or by strong interstellar radiation field ( see , e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "detailed investigations of disk structure and of the origins of any observed difference are clearly necessary to improve our understanding of the formation of planetary systems .    here",

    "we therefore assume that the carma observations trace the bulk of the disk emission .",
    "disk radii range from 90 au ( dr  tau ) to 320  au ( sr  24  s ) and the surface brightness slopes vary from steep ( e.g. , dg  tau , dr  tau , dn  tau ) to quite shallow ( e.g. , ry  tau , cy  tau , lkca  15 , gss  39 ) .",

    "we point out that in disks with @xmath8 , the surface density @xmath2 increases with radius @xmath23 and reach a maximum at about the transitional radius @xmath62 .",
    "we argue that this particular behavior of @xmath2 can mimic the inner disk clearing advocated to explain the dominant characteristic of some `` transitional disks '' , namely a deficit in the near and mid - infrared excess over the stellar photosphere and the presence of an `` hole '' in the surface brightness observed at millimeter wavelengths . for lkca15",
    ", we show that a surface density with @xmath186 that extends without any discontinuity up to the disk inner radius located at few stellar radii can reproduce both the sed and the 1.3 mm continuum emission .",
    "by contrast , we find no clear explanation in terms of the similarity solution of the surface density for the dust depleted inner disks around dm  tau and gm  aur .",
    "it seems likely that `` transitional disks '' may originate from a large variety of effects .",
    "finally , it appears that most of the disks in our sample are very different from the currently - accepted view of the solar nebula .",
    "while most of them have masses similar to the minimum mass solar nebula , 0.02 m@xmath1 , their transitional radii are at least a factor 4 larger than the value @xmath201 au derived from the actual distribution of solid bodies in the solar system @xcite .",
    "the exception is tw  hya which has a very small disk radius , @xmath202 au , compared to its large age , @xmath203 myr .",
    "we argue that tw  hya disks probably formed with @xmath62 in the range from 4 to 8 au , and may well reflect the properties of our early solar system .",
    "we are indebted to meredith hughes and david wilner for providing the sma data of gm  aur and tw  hya .",

    "the uncertainties on the stellar temperature correspond to half a spectral type , while the stellar luminosity is uncertain by 30% . from dm97 models , the stellar ages range from  0.1  myr ( dr  tau and dg  tau ) to 7  myr ( tw  hya ) . in taurus - auriga alone",
    "the age spread is 13 myr .",
    "however , as illustrated in the upper panel of figure [ fig : comp_hr ] , these ages are smaller than those inferred from b98 by factor of 2.6 - 10 .",
    "similarly , the lower panel of figure  [ fig : comp_hr ] shows that the stellar masses inferred from b98 are systematically larger than those from dm97 by factors of 1.2 - 3.4 .",
    "neither model reproduces the dynamical masses derived by @xcite for dm  tau , gm  aur , cy  tau and lkca  15 . typically the dm97-derived masses are lower than the dynamical masses by 10 - 40% while b98-masses are lower by 20 - 30% . for the purpose of our analysis we have adopted dm97 models because they enable us to derive masses and ages for all the stars in our sample , while ry  tau and mwc  275 are outside the temperature and luminosity range of the bh98 model",
    "for fixed stellar parameters , dust opacity and disk inner radius , the dust emission model is defined by the state @xmath204 where @xmath80 is the disk inclination , pa is the disk position angle measured from north to east , @xmath62 is the disk transition radius , @xmath67 is the disk surface density at @xmath62 and @xmath4 defines the shape of the disk surface density as discussed in   [ sec : modsim ] .",
    "the model that best fits the observations is found through the minimization of @xmath24 ( eq .  [ eq : chi2 ] ) .",
    "we adopt a bayesian approach in which the joint probabilities for the observed data d and the given model state x are described as the product of the probability of the observed data d given the model parameters x ( i.e. , the likelihood ) , and a known prior probability distribution function @xmath205 of the model parameters : @xmath206 in this framework , the best - fit model corresponds to the state x that maximizes the a posteriori distribution @xmath207 .    to characterize the posteriori distribution",
    "we adopt a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method ( see , e.g. , ford 2005 , fitzgerald et al .",
    "this method generates a chain of states x sampled from a desired probability function @xmath205 , whose equilibrium distribution is equal to the posteriori distribution @xmath207 . in our specific case ,",
    "since complex visibilities errors are described by a normal distribution ( wrobel & walker 1999 ) , the probability of the observables ( i.e , the real and imaginary part of the complex visibility ) given the model state x , is expressed by the @xmath24 distribution . to a first approximation this is proportional to @xmath208 . in the most general case , where all model states have the same prior probability and @xmath209 , the posteriori joint probability is also roughly proportional to @xmath208 .",
    "the state that maximizes @xmath207 therefore correspond to the state that minimizes @xmath210 , justifying the choice of the @xmath24 as the maximum likelihood estimator .",
    "the mcmc fitting is realized following @xcite and is briefly summarized here .",
    "first , the chain is constructed using the metropolis - hastings algorithm with the gibbs sampler , and generating a chain of models where the ( n+1)-th state depends only on the n - th state through a specified transition probability @xmath211 . in practice , at each n - th step of the chain we ( 1 ) generate a random trail state x adopting a transition probability described by a gaussian distribution centered on x , ( 2 ) calculate @xmath212 , and ( 3 ) accept the trail state as the new ( n+1)-th state of the chain if it satisfies an acceptance probability @xmath213 specified by the m - h algorithm , namely if @xmath214,1 \\right\\ } \\geq u\\ ] ] where @xmath215 is a random number generated from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 .",
    "for the gibbs sampler , the trial state x is generated by substituting only a subset of parameters from the state x. in particular , since @xmath62 , @xmath67 and @xmath4 are correlated ( eq .",
    "[ eq : sigma_used ] ) , we choose to change these three parameters at the same time , while varying the inclination and the position angle independently . at each step , the parameter(s ) to be updated ( @xmath216 ) are then randomly modified with a transition probability of @xmath217},\\ ] ] where the variance @xmath218 defines the variability interval for each parameter . the model fitting results depend neither on the choice of the transition probability @xmath219 nor on how the gibbs sampler is implemented .",
    "however these strongly effect the efficiency of the model fitting and must be carefully chosen to allow a fast convergence toward the equilibrium distribution . here , each parameter is allowed to vary over a large interval and the variance @xmath218 is chosen so that the overall acceptance rate is close to the optimal value of @xmath90.25 ( gelman et al .",
    "2003 ) .    to select the initial state of the chain",
    "we adopt two different approaches .",
    "first , the initial parameters for the disk are set based on the gaussian fit to the observations ( table  [ tab : gau_fit ] ) ; the initial inclination and pa are calculated from the aspect ratio of the emission , the transition radius @xmath62 is assumed to be the half width along the major axis at half maximum , @xmath220 is set to be 0.5 and @xmath67 is randomly chosen between 0.1 and 1000 g/@xmath147 .",
    "this choice is usually close to what provided by the best fit model and enables a quick convergence of the chain .",
    "unfortunately , like most algorithms developed to minimize the @xmath24 , the mcmc can be trapped in local minima if they are separated by sufficiently high @xmath24 barriers .",
    "to compensate , additional randomly initialized mcmc chains were run to verify that they all converge to the same final state .",
    "once the equilibrium distribution of the mcmc chain is sufficiently well sampled  usually requiring a run of a minimum of 10@xmath221 models  the distribution of each parameter is obtained through marginalization , i.e. by integrating the posteriori distribution ( now equivalent to the mcmc equilibrium distribution ) over all the parameters except the one in which we are interested .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : prob ] the obtained posteriori distributions for the model parameters .",
    "these are generally consistent with a normal profile , supporting our decision to adopt a gaussian transition probability @xmath219 , and enables expressing the parameter uncertainties in terms of the standard deviation @xmath110 of the probability distribution .",
    "we integrate the surface density ( eq .  [ eq : sigma_used ] ) to derive the cumulative disk mass , i.e. , the disk mass contained within a radius @xmath23 at time @xmath56 . since @xmath222",

    "<S> we present new sub - arcsecond ( 0.7  ) combined array for research in millimeter - wave astronomy ( carma ) observations of the 1.3 mm continuum emission from circumstellar disks around 11 low and intermediate mass pre - main sequence stars . </S>",
    "<S> high resolution observations for 3 additional sources were obtained from literature . in all cases the disk emission is spatially resolved . </S>",
    "<S> we adopt a self consistent accretion disk model based on the similarity solution for the disk surface density and constrain the dust radial density distribution on spatial scales of about 40 au . </S>",
    "<S> disk surface densities appear to be correlated with the stellar ages where the characteristic disk radius increases from   20 au to 100 au over about 5 myr . </S>",
    "<S> this disk expansion is accompanied by a decrease in the mass accretion rate , suggesting that our sample disks form an evolutionary sequence . </S>",
    "<S> interpreting our results in terms of the temporal evolution of a viscous @xmath0-disk , we estimate ( i ) that at the beginning of the disk evolution about 60% of the circumstellar material was located inside radii of 2540 au , ( ii ) that disks formed with masses from 0.05 to 0.4 m@xmath1 and ( iii ) that the viscous timescale at the disk initial radius is about 0.1 - 0.3 myr . </S>",
    "<S> viscous disk models tightly link the surface density @xmath2 with the radial profile of the disk viscosity @xmath3 . we find values of @xmath4 ranging from -0.8 to 0.8 , suggesting that the viscosity dependence on the orbital radius can be very different in the observed disks . adopting the @xmath0 parameterization for the viscosity </S>",
    "<S> , we argue that @xmath0 must decrease with the orbital radius and that it may vary between 0.5 and @xmath5 . from the inferred disk </S>",
    "<S> initial radii we derive specific angular momenta , @xmath6 , for parent cores of @xmath7 km / s pc . </S>",
    "<S> comparison with the values of @xmath6 in dense cores suggests that about 10% of core angular momentum and 30% of the core mass are conserved in the formation of the star / disk system . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the similarity solution for the surface density for @xmath8 can explain the properties of some `` transitional disks '' without requiring discontinuities in the disk surface density . in the case of lkca  15 , a smooth distribution of material from few stellar radii to about 240 au can produce both the observed sed and the spatially resolved continuum emission at millimeter wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> finally we show that among the observed sample , tw  hya is the only object that has a disk radius comparable with the early solar nebula . </S>"
