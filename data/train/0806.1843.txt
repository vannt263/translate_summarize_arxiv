    "the problem of traffic congestions in communication networks is undoubtedly an important issue .",
    "the problem is related to the geometry of the underlying network , the rate that messages are generated and delivered , and the routing strategy .",
    "many studies have been focused on spatial structures such as regular lattices and the cayley tree @xcite .",
    "random networks and scale - free ( sf ) networks have also been widely studied .",
    "the former is homogeneous with a poisson degree distribution ; while the latter typically exhibits a power - law degree distribution of the form @xmath0 signifying the existence of nodes with large degrees .",
    "sf networks are found in many real - world networks , such as the internet , world wide web ( www ) , and metabolic network @xcite .",
    "a standard model of sf networks is the barabsi and albert ( ba ) model of growing networks with preferential attachments @xcite . the ba model gives a degree distribution of @xmath1 and is non - assortative @xcite , i.e. , the chance of two nodes being connected is independent of the degrees of the nodes concerned . while there are other variations on the ba models that give a degree exponent that deviates from @xmath2 @xcite , the ba model still serves as the basic model for sf networks . in the present work ,",
    "we study how a dynamical and adaptive routing strategy would enhance the performance in delivering messages over a ba scale - free network .    in communication models ,",
    "the nodes are taken to be both hosts and routers , and the links serve as possible pathways through which messages or packets are forwarded to their destination .",
    "early studies assumed a constant ( degree - independent ) packet generation rate @xmath3 and a constant rate of delivering one packet per time step at each node .",
    "as @xmath3 increases , the traffic goes from a free - flow phase to a congested or jamming phase .",
    "obviously , such models are too simple for real - world networks .",
    "more realistic models should incorporate the fact that nodes with higher degrees would have higher capability of handling information packets and at the same time generate more packets .",
    "models with degree - dependent packet - delivery rate of the form @xmath4 @xcite and degree - dependent packet - generating rate @xcite of the form @xmath5 have recently been proposed and studied , with routing strategy based on forwarding messages through the shortest path to their destination . implementing this routing strategy in sf and random networks",
    "indicate that it is easier to lead to congestions in sf networks than in random networks @xcite .",
    "it is because the nodes with large degrees in sf networks are on many shortest - paths between two arbitrarily chosen nodes , i.e. , large betweenness @xcite .",
    "many packets will be passing by and queueing up at these nodes enroute to their destination . in a random network , jamming is harder to occur as the packets tend to be distributed quite uniformly to each node .",
    "a good routing algorithm is essential for sustaining the proper functioning of a network @xcite .",
    "the shortest - path routing approach is based on _ static _ information ,",
    "i.e. , once the network is constructed , the shortest - paths are fixed . to improve routing efficiency , echenique _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed an approach in which a node would choose a neighboring node to deliver a packet by considering the shortest - path from the neighboring node to the destination _ and _ the waiting time at the neighboring node .",
    "the waiting time depends on the number of packets in the queue at a neighboring node at the time of decision and thus corresponds to a _ dynamical _ or _ time - dependent _ information . this algorithm performs better than the shortest - path approach , as packets may be delivered not necessarily through the shortest - path and thus the loading at the higher degree nodes in a sf network is reduced .",
    "the approach has also been applied to networks with degree - dependent packet generation rate @xcite .",
    "recently , wang _",
    "@xcite proposed an algorithm that tends to spread the packets evenly to nodes by considering information on nearest neighbors .",
    "however , the delivering time turns out to be much longer than that in the shortest - path approach as the packets tend to wander around the network .    in the present work",
    ", we propose an efficient routing strategy that is based on the projected waiting time along the shortest - path from a neighboring node to the destination .",
    "the algorithm is implemented in ba scale - free networks , with degree - dependent packet generating and delivering rates .",
    "results show that jamming is harder to occur using the present strategy , when compared with both the shortest - path approach and the echenique s approach .",
    "key features observed in numerical results are explained within a mean field treatment .",
    "the present approach has the advantage of spreading the packets among the nodes according to the degrees of the nodes . in this way",
    ", every node can contribute to the packet delivery process .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model , including the underlying network , the packet generation and delivery mechanisms , and routing strategy , is introduced in sec.ii . in sec.iii , we present numerical results and compared them with those of the other routing strategies .",
    "we also explain key features within a mean field theory .",
    "we summarize our results in sec.iv .",
    "the underlying network structure is taken to be the barabasi - albert ( ba ) scale - free growing network with @xmath6 nodes @xcite . starting with @xmath7 nodes , each new node entering the network is allowed to establish @xmath8 new links to existing nodes .",
    "preferential attachment whereby an existing node @xmath9 with a higher degree @xmath10 has a higher probability @xmath11 to attract a new link is imposed .",
    "the mean degree of the network is @xmath12 and the degree distribution @xmath13 follows a power - law behavior of the form @xmath14 .    the dynamics of packet generation and delivery is implemented as follows . due to the inhomogeneous nature of the ba network , it is more natural to impose a packet generation rate that is proportional to the degree of a node . at each time step ,",
    "a node @xmath9 creates @xmath5 new packets .",
    "the fractional part of @xmath5 is implemented probabilistically .",
    "a destination is randomly assigned to each created packet .",
    "the newly created packets will be put in a queue at the node and delivery will be made on the first - in - first - out basis .",
    "the packets in the queue may consist of those which are created at previous time steps and received from neighboring nodes enroute to their destination .",
    "we also assume a packet delivery rate that is proportional to the degree of a node @xcite . at each time step",
    ", a node @xmath9 delivers at most @xmath15 packets to its neighbors .",
    "the fractional part of @xmath15 is implemented probabilistically .",
    "a larger @xmath16 implies a higher packet - handling capability , but it would translate into higher cost or capital . here , the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath16 are taken to be node - independent .",
    "a packet is removed from the system upon arrival at its destination .",
    "for a given generation rate characterized by @xmath3 , there exists a critical value of the delivery rate @xmath17 such that for delivery rates @xmath18 , packets tend to accumulate in the network resulting in a jamming phase ; while for @xmath19 , a non - jamming phase results as there are as many packets delivered to their destination as created .",
    "a better performance is thus characterized by a smaller value of @xmath17 .",
    "the novel feature of the present work is the routing strategy or the selection of a neighbor in delivering a packet .",
    "the idea is to choose a neighbor that would give the shortest time , including waiting time , to deliver the packets along the shortest path from the chosen neighbor to the destination .",
    "consider a packet with destination node @xmath20 leaving node @xmath9 .",
    "each of the @xmath10 neighbors of node @xmath9 has a shortest path to the destination node @xmath20 .",
    "the shortest path refers to the smallest number of links from a node to another .",
    "however , due to the possible accumulation of packets at each node , the number of time steps it takes to deliver the message may be different from the number of links along the shortest path .",
    "consider a neighbor labelled @xmath21 of the node @xmath9 .",
    "we label the shortest path from node @xmath21 to @xmath20 by @xmath22 . along this path , we evaluate the following quantity for the node @xmath21 : @xmath23 where the sum is over the nodes along the shortest path @xmath22 , excluding the destination . here , @xmath24 is the number of packets accumulated at node @xmath25 , at the moment of decision .",
    "thus , @xmath26 is an estimate of the time that a packet would take to go from node @xmath21 to the destination @xmath20 through the shortest path .",
    "node @xmath9 would choose a neighboring node with the minimum @xmath26 to forward the packet , i.e. , the selection is based on @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the set of @xmath10 nodes consisting of the neighbors of node @xmath9 .",
    "this procedure is repeated for each node and each packet in every time step . for a network far from jamming , each node can handle all the packets in every time step . in this free - flow situation ,",
    "the quantity @xmath26 simply measures the shortest path @xmath29 from @xmath21 to @xmath20 .",
    "when packets are queueing up at the nodes , however , a delivery mechanism based on @xmath26 takes into account of the queueing time and may not pass the packet to a neighboring node that is closest to the destination .",
    "to justify our routing scheme , we will compare results with two other routing strategies widely studied in the literature .",
    "using the same packet generating mechanism , the shortest - path approach selects a neighbor with the shortest path to the destination for forwarding a packet .",
    "@xcite proposed an approach that takes into account of the waiting time . for a delivering rate of one packet per time step",
    ", they proposed to choose a neighbor that has a minimum value of @xmath30 , where @xmath29 is the shortest path length from node @xmath21 to @xmath20 .",
    "the parameter @xmath31 is a weighing factor , which can be taken as a variational parameter and @xmath32 is found to give the best performance .",
    "the echenique s approach thus accounts for the waiting time only at the neighboring nodes . for a delivery rate of @xmath15 ,",
    "a modified echenique s approach is to choose a neighboring node with a minimum value of @xmath33 we have checked that for a given value of @xmath3 , the smallest value of @xmath17 is attained for values of @xmath34 to @xmath35 . in what follows , we will use a value of @xmath36 for the echenique s approach given by eq.(2 ) .",
    "the different phases in a network can be illustrated by looking at the average number of packets per node at a given time @xmath37 and the average time for a packet to remain in the network or the delivering time @xmath38 .",
    "we take @xmath39 and @xmath40 and construct a ba scale - free network of @xmath41 nodes .",
    "figure [ evolution ] shows the results of @xmath42 and @xmath38 as a function of time for a fixed value of @xmath43 .",
    "as @xmath16 increases , there are distinct behavior . for values of @xmath16 smaller than some critical value @xmath44 , @xmath42 grows almost linearly with time after the transient ( see fig.[evolution](a ) ) .",
    "this corresponds to a jamming phase . as @xmath16 increases , the slope in the long time behavior decreases , indicating a slower accumulation of packets in the network as the ability of handling packets @xmath16 increases . for @xmath45",
    ", @xmath42 becomes independent of time in the long time limit .",
    "this corresponds to a non - jamming phase .",
    "similarly behavior is exhibited in @xmath38 . in the jamming phase , @xmath38 increases with time monotonically , due to the increasing waiting time in the queues at intermediate nodes as a packet is forwarded to its destination .",
    "fewer packets are delivered to their destination than generated . in the non - jamming phase ,",
    "@xmath38 becomes independent of time in the long time limit . in this regime , further increasing @xmath16 will lead to smaller @xmath42 and shorter @xmath38 in the long time limit until these quantities saturate .",
    "this is possible since a non - jamming phase corresponds either to the case in which all the packets at the nodes are forwarded every time step or steady queues of packets exist at the nodes . in both cases ,",
    "the number of packets does not increase in the long time limit .",
    "the former case is the free - flow phase , while the latter is reminiscent of the synchronized phase in vehicular traffic flows @xcite in which the packets undergo a stop - and - go behavior . for @xmath46 for example , @xmath47 , which is somewhat larger than the average shortest distance or diameter @xmath48 of the network .",
    "this indicates that , due to the routing strategy in forwarding a packet , the dynamics in the free - flow phase is different from that of the shortest - path approach .",
    "the critical value @xmath49 can be determined by considering the quantity @xmath50 where @xmath51 and the average is over all the nodes at a time @xmath52 .",
    "this quantity @xmath53 $ ] is basically the slope of @xmath42 in the long time limit . in the non - jamming phase ,",
    "the slope vanishes and @xmath54 ; while in the jamming phase , @xmath55 . figure [ order ] shows @xmath56 as a function of @xmath16 , for a fixed value of @xmath57 .",
    "the critical value @xmath17 can be identified as the value that separates the @xmath54 and @xmath58 behavior .",
    "we carried out similar calculations for different values of @xmath3 and determined @xmath44 .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[betac ] ( circles ) .",
    "we will explain the form of @xmath44 using a mean field theory .",
    "the curve @xmath44 can also be regarded as a phase boundary in the @xmath3-@xmath16 plane , separating the jamming phase below the curve and the non - jamming phase above the curve .    to show the superior performance of our routing strategy",
    ", we also performed calculations using the shortest - path approach and the echenique s approach with @xmath36 in eq.(2 ) .",
    "the same degree - dependent packet generating mechanism is used .",
    "results of @xmath44 for these two models are also shown in fig.[betac ] for comparison .",
    "the present approach gives the best performance . for a given @xmath3",
    ", we see the improvement in performance from the shortest - path approach through the echenique s approach to the present approach , signified by the drop of @xmath17 . for the shortest - path approach , it has been shown @xcite that @xmath44 follows the functional form of @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 with @xmath62 being the diameter and @xmath63 the maximum degree of the network . for @xmath64 , @xmath65 . with the present approach",
    ", @xmath44 follows a similar functional form , but with a _ higher _ value of @xmath66 and a smaller prefactor that gives the slope .",
    "both the present approach and the echenique s approach perform better than the shortest - approach approach because packets are re - directed to other nodes when there are long queues at the hubs .",
    "the better performance of the present approach is achieved by spreading the packets among the nodes so that the number of packets at a node is proportional to the degree @xmath67 of the node in the free - flow phase .",
    "we use a mean field approach to illustrate this point .",
    "let @xmath68 be the average number of packets at the nodes with degree @xmath67 . in the free - flow phase where @xmath69 , we have @xmath70 the first and second terms denote the packets generated at the node and delivered to neighboring nodes , respectively .",
    "the third term accounts for the packets delivered _ into _ the node from its neighboring nodes . here",
    "@xmath71 is the conditional probability that a node of degree @xmath67 has a neighbor of degree @xmath72 and the sum runs from the minimum degree @xmath73 to @xmath63 in the network . in the free - flow regime ,",
    "the packets that are removed upon arrival at their destination can be assumed to be @xmath67-independent and approximated by the term @xmath74 .",
    "the non - assortative feature of ba networks @xcite gives @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the degree distribution .",
    "after the transient behavior , @xmath77 and we have @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the mean number of packets per node .",
    "thus for @xmath80 , @xmath81 in the free - flow phase after the transient .",
    "figure [ stationary](a ) shows the numerical results obtained by averaging the number of packets on the nodes with degree @xmath67 at different times ( time @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 time steps ) of a run . in the free - flow phase , @xmath81 and",
    "becomes time - independent after the transient , as shown in fig.[stationary](a ) for the case of @xmath85 and @xmath43 .",
    "this behavior is consistent with that in eq.([eq : stationary ] ) .    for the jamming phase , numerical results ( see fig.[stationary](b ) )",
    "show that ( i ) @xmath81 at a fixed instant _ and _ ( ii ) @xmath68 increases with time for fixed value of @xmath67 .",
    "this behavior can be understood provided that the packets are still distributed among the nodes in proportion to the degree @xmath67 of a node via our strategy . in this phase , the long time behavior is characterized by an increasing accumulation of packets and the delivery to destinations becomes negligible compared with packet generation . with @xmath86 for all nodes and ignoring the removal of packets , eq.(6 ) is modified to @xmath87 it follows that @xmath88 increases with time @xmath52 as @xmath89 which describes very well the features in fig.[stationary](b ) .",
    "thus , the present approach has the effect of reducing ( increasing ) the probability of passing packets to neighbors with high ( low ) degrees when there are long ( no or short ) queues , resulting in a distribution of packets according to the degrees of the nodes .",
    "a rough estimate of @xmath44 can be obtained by equating @xmath68 in the free - flow phase to @xmath90 . in particular , taking @xmath91 , we get from eq.([eq : stationary ] ) that @xmath92 where @xmath62 is the average number of nodes that a packet passes through from its origin to the destination , which is the diameter of the network in the free - flow phase .",
    "the last line is valid for @xmath93 . comparing with eq.([eq : sp ] ) for the shortest - path approach , we note that @xmath94 and the prefactor @xmath62 , which gives the slope in fig.[betac ] , is smaller than that in the shortest - path approach .",
    "these features are consistent with numerical results . in particular , for @xmath41 nodes , we found that @xmath95 and @xmath96 , giving @xmath97 , which is in reasonable agreement with numerical results in fig.[betac ] .",
    "in summary , we have proposed an efficient routing strategy on forwarding packets in a scale - free network .",
    "the strategy accounts not only for the physical separation from the destination but also on the waiting time along possible paths .",
    "we showed that our strategy performs better than both the shortest - path approach and the echenique s approach .",
    "analytically , we construct a mean field treatment which gives results in agreement with observed features in numerical results .",
    "our routing strategy has the merit of distributing the packets among the nodes according to the degree , and hence handling capability , of the nodes .",
    "although our discussion was carried out on ba networks , we believe that our approach is also applicable in other spatial structures .",
    "we end by comparing the three different routing strategies in more general terms .",
    "the shortest - path approach depends entirely on geometrical information that is _",
    "static_. once the origin and the destination of a packet is known , the shortest - path is fixed .",
    "this strategy is _ non - adaptive _ , i.e. , it will not be change with time .",
    "the echenique s approach considers both geometrical and local dynamical information . by considering the waiting time at a neighboring node",
    ", a packet from a node @xmath9 to a destination @xmath20 will not always follow the same path .",
    "thus , the echenique s approach is a strategy that is _ adaptive _ , i.e. , a decision based on the current situation .",
    "the present strategy , like the echenique s approach , is also adaptive and makes use of _ global _ information in which all the waiting times along a path are taken into consideration .",
    "we see that by allowing for adaptive strategies and taking more information into consideration , a better performance results .",
    "this line of thought is in accordance with that in complex adaptive systems @xcite whereby active agents may adapt , interact , and learn from past experience .",
    "it should be , however , noted that it pays to be better .",
    "the shortest - path approach does not require update of the routing strategy .",
    "the echenique s approach and the present approach require continuing update of the number of packets accumulated at the nodes .",
    "such updating plays the role of a cost , with the payoff being the better performance .",
    "practical implementation would have to consider the balance between the cost and the payoff .",
