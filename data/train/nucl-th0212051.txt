    "reaction cross sections from the scattering of nucleons by nuclei ( stable and radioactive ) are required in a number of fields of study ; some being of quite current interest  @xcite .",

    "an example of the latter is the transmutation of long lived radioactive waste into shorter lived products using accelerator driven systems ( ads ) . as well , proton - nucleus ( @xmath2-@xmath3 ) cross section values at energies to 300 mev or more are needed not only to specify important quantities of relevance to proton radiation therapy  @xcite , but also as they are key information in assessing radiation protection for patients . as an example in basic science , total reaction cross sections are important ingredients to a number of problems in astrophysics . also the integral observable of proton scattering from a given nucleus",
    "gives direct information on the neutron root mean square radius in nuclei  @xcite ; a property sought in parity - violating electron scattering experiments  @xcite .",
    "it would be very utilitarian if aspects of such scattering were well approximated by a simple convenient functional form .",
    "recently it has been shown  @xcite that , for neutron total reaction cross sections , such a form may exist .",
    "herein we consider that concept further to reproduce the measured total reaction cross sections from proton scattering for energies ranging from 10 mev to 300 mev , and from 15 nuclei ranging in mass from 9 to 238 .",

    "those usually are due to limitations with the structure model used to describe the ground state densities of some nuclei .",
    "however , there have been so many successes with the approach  @xcite that we believe the functional form developed here on the basis of matching the values obtained with g - folding potentials are pertinent initial guesses to start a refinement ( of the parameter values ) to reproduce actual measured total reaction cross sections .    as evident from the figures presented in a recent paper  @xcite ,",
    "the partial total reaction cross sections , @xmath13 , can be described by the simple functional form , @xmath14^{-1 }   + \\epsilon ( 2l_0 + 1 )   e^{\\frac{(l - l_0)}{a } } \\left [ 1 + e^{\\frac{(l - l_0)}{a } } \\right]^{-2 } \\label{fnform}\\ ] ] with @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 varying smoothly with energy and mass .",
