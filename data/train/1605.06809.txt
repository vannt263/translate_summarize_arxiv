    "actually , it has numerous applications such as predicting where plastic deformations ( leading to mechanical failure ) might occur in space , which is called soft spot  @xcite .    to obtain the spatial distribution and correlation of vibrational eigen modes in dense particle assemblies ,",
    "normal mode analysis is frequently used  @xcite . in such analysis ,",
    "the vibrational modes are approximated as harmonic oscillators . here ,",
    "they are characterized by diagonalizing the hessian matrix , which is composed of second derivatives of the potential energy with respect to the coordinates of the particles .",
    "unfortunately , its computational and memory costs tend to be huge , because even when rotational motions are neglected , the matrix size is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the particle number .",
    "thus in previous studies  @xcite , small system sizes tend to be used . on the other hand , in order to study very low frequency modes , larger system sizes will be inevitable , and thus , another innovative method with low computational costs will be desired .    to characterize these spatial properties ,",
    "the participation ratio is often measured  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the participation ratio alone is not sufficient to characterize the degree of collectivity in the particles vibrations  it only measures the degree of localization in the particles vibrations .",

    ", we outline a novel method to characterize the spatial distribution and correlation of vibrational modes without diagonalizing a huge hessian matrix .",
    "although our case study is a small system size of @xmath6 , this method can be easily extended to much larger system sizes .",

    "has already been described  @xcite .",

    ", we excite a specific vibrational mode by giving active oscillation in each particle s diameter with an identical driving frequency .",
    "the response is then obtained as the real time displacements of the particles , which can be compared to the conventional normal modes obtained from static hessian matrix .",

    "the results of these measurements are again found to be consistent for both the real time displacements and the static normal eigen mode .",
    "more importantly , from these measurements we can distinguish three distinct frequency regimes based on the spatial distribution of the particles vibrations ( whether they are extended and/or collective in space ) .",
    "finally by directly measuring the real time displacements of the particles , we may obtain dynamical quantities such as the mean squared displacement ( msd ) .",
    "the msd gives us the relative amplitude of particles vibrations .",
    "in particular we find that particles vibrate over larger distances at lower frequency excitation .",

    "we consider a dense suspension of @xmath5 soft spherical particles at zero temperature in a two - dimensional square box of linear size @xmath7 with periodic boundary conditions on each side .",
    "the interaction between the particles is modelled by a short - ranged , purely repulsive , harmonic potential ( similar to foams  @xcite ) : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 . @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the diameter and position of particle @xmath13 respectively .",

    "thus as one of the aims of this paper , we will make some comparisons between the vibrational normal modes and the real time particles displacements .",
    "since we are only interested in the vibrational steady state , we fix the oscillation amplitude to be much smaller than the critical amplitude @xmath45 ( @xmath60 in all our simulations ) .",

    "the value of the driving frequency @xmath34 is not important since they will all give the same distribution of normal modes as we shall see later .",

    ", we fix @xmath94 ( in simulation units ) , although the result does not depend strongly of the value of @xmath92 .",
    "physically @xmath95 if all the particles in the neighbourhood of particle @xmath13 move in the same direction and @xmath96 if they all move in random direction ( disordered or isotropic ) .",

    "as can be seen from these plots , both @xmath101 and @xmath102 overlap each other , indicating high degree of correlation between the real time displacements and the static normal mode .",

    "this coincides with the soft modes region as defined in jamming phenomena ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dos](a ) ) , and thus , we may also identify the soft modes to be the onset of collective order in the displacement or eigen vectors ( regime i in our classification ) .    to quantify the degree of extensivity ( or inversely , localization ) , we calculate the participation ratio @xmath75 as defined in  @xcite . the participation ratio of the particles displacements @xmath107 is defined to be : @xmath108 physically @xmath109 if the motion of the particles is extended over the whole system size , and on the other hand , @xmath110 if the motion is localized . similarly , the participation ratio of the eigen vectors @xmath111 is defined to be : @xmath112 in fig .",

    "[ fig : dr ] top right to fig .",
    "[ fig : dr ] bottom right , we have already seen a region of large overlap between the real time displacements and the eigen vectors ( dotted oval in the figure ) . thus , we define the overlap function @xmath117 to be the dot product between the displacement field @xmath66 and the eigen vector @xmath84 : @xmath118 where @xmath119 .",
    "note that the eigen vector @xmath84 is obtained from the hessian matrix of the particles configuration at time @xmath49 , the initial time of the displacement vector @xmath86 .",

    "( again , the data is repeated over an ensemble of @xmath80 independent simulations and then averaged . )",
    "as can be seen from these plots , we observe a peak in the overlap function @xmath117 at exactly the driving frequency of the system @xmath122 .",
    "thus by introducing an active oscillation in the system , we can excite the normal mode of the system which corresponds to the driving frequency of the active oscillation .    to quantify the relative magnitude of the particles vibrations , we also compute the mean squared displacement ( msd ) as a function of delay time @xmath67 : @xmath123 where the initial time @xmath49 is fixed .",

    "this is consistent to the experimental results in  @xcite , where they observe large low - frequency vibrational amplitude in the disordered structural regions .",
    "this increasing distance over which the particles vibrate can be explained by increasing participation ratio and collective order as the frequency is lowered .    to analyze the dependence on the driving frequency more fully",

    "[ fig : dos ] ( a ) , we have also checked that the normal mode analysis is not influenced by the external oscillations , because the oscillation amplitude is extremely small ( @xmath60 ) . in fig .",

    "furthermore we have measured the direct correlations between the real time displacement vectors of the particles driven with @xmath34 and the eigen vectors of the arbitrary modes @xmath1 obtained from the normal mode analysis by means of the overlap function @xmath117 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] ( c ) , we have indeed found clear correlation where @xmath129 .",
    "this means that our new method works well as performed in the normal mode analysis .    from these analysis",
    ", we have revealed that both of the real time displacements for the oscillatory driven particles and the eigen vectors of normal mode analysis are composed of at least three different regimes such as regime i : the correlated extended regime ( @xmath130 ) due to @xmath131 with @xmath132 , regime ii : the disordered extended regime ( @xmath133 ) due to @xmath134 with @xmath135 , and regime iii : the disordered localized regime ( @xmath136 ) due to @xmath137 with @xmath138 in the athermal amorphous solid close to @xmath139 .",
    "finally we have found that the typical amplitude of real time vibrations driven with low frequency oscillation is much larger than those with high frequency by measuring the one cycle mean squared displacement @xmath140 as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : dos ] ( d ) and ( e ) .",
    "these results are consistent with features of the eigen modes measured by the normal mode analysis  @xcite .    in this method",
    ", we are able to fully characterize the vibrational properties of amorphous materials ( such as participation ratio @xmath141 and polarization @xmath142 ) without the need of diagonalizing a large hessian matrix .",
    "nevertheless , this method appears to be unable to directly measure the vdos ( or @xmath79 ) .",
    "but , the vdos has been obtained from the fourier transform of the velocity auto correlation with respect to time without computing the hessian matrix   @xcite . here",
    ", we note that the computational and memory costs for this velocity auto correlation together with the fourier transform are of the order of @xmath143 .",
    "thus combined with our new method , we can obtain most of the basic vibrational quantities .",
    "it should also be noted that when we oscillate the particles diameters , the amplitude of oscillation should be kept small enough such that the response of the particles remains linear . in our case",
    ", we always check that the total potential energy @xmath144 is approximately sinusoidal with frequency equal to the driving frequency for each simulation run .",
    "previously we also defined @xmath45 to be the critical amplitude above which the motion of the particles become irreversible .",
    "below @xmath45 , the motion of the particles is reversible , but not necessarily linear .",
    "nonlinearity in our system come in the form of period - doubling , in which , the particles vibrate with a frequency @xmath145  @xcite , but the motion of the particles remains reversible . in  @xcite ,",
    "finite size scaling shows that @xmath45 approaches to a finite value as @xmath146 .",
    "thus we can always find a reversible phase irrespective of the system size used .",
    "however in  @xcite , it has also been shown that the window of linear regime with respect to @xmath35 in the reversible phase scales as @xmath147 , where @xmath148 .",
    "this means that the linear regime vanishes at jamming transition point . and above jamming , the linear regime becomes narrower as @xmath146 .",
    "nevertheless , above jamming , we can always find a small enough value of @xmath35 in which the response is still linear for large but finite @xmath5 .",
    "in this paper we fix @xmath60 , but , we also perform several test simulations with @xmath149 and we still find reliable results.this means we can easily extend our simulation to large system size @xmath150 and still find linear response with @xmath149 . additionally , our method may also provide a useful tool to investigate the non - linear behaviour at large system sizes , close to jamming transition .    in future studies , by using our model",
    ", we will examine a much larger system size , not only for athermal jammed systems but also for thermal glasses .",
    "for instance in low temperature glasses , the scaled vdos @xmath151 shows a peak in the low frequency regime , which is called the boson peak .",
    "this has been observed in experimental systems such as oxide  @xcite , metallic  @xcite , and organic materials  @xcite as well as numerical simulations of model glasses  @xcite . as a related matter",
    ", the low frequency vibrational modes in thermal glasses appear to be quasi - localized and collective based on theoretical arguments  @xcite , as well as numerical simulations  @xcite and experiments  @xcite . according to the experiments of colloidal particles @xcite",
    ", such characteristic behaviours of low frequency modes may originate from large vibrations due to structural defects , analogous to crystals .",
    "it is indicated that such low frequency modes could play a significant role in the appearance of boson peak @xcite . at even lower frequency",
    ", debye modes also appear to be restored  @xcite . to study such crossover behaviour , a much higher resolution of the frequency space",
    "will be needed , which requires much larger system sizes .",
    "however , conventional normal mode analysis requires a huge computational cost and thus a more efficient computational method will be desired . to perform such studies , we propose a model where thermal noise is applied in addition to the active oscillations in the particles diameters .",
    "in particular , by using our analysis of both participation ratio @xmath141 and average polarization @xmath142 , we may identify multiple frequency regimes in low temperature glasses , which may coincide with the appearance of boson peak at low frequency  @xcite as well as debye modes at extremely low frequency  @xcite .",
    "our model can also be easily extended to other forms of two - body potentials such as lennard - jones , gaussian core _",
    "etc_. in such case , we oscillate the interaction range and then we expect the same results",
    ". it might also be interesting to consider other models of deformations which can excite a particular vibrational mode with a specific frequency .",
    "for instance , we might apply an oscillatory shear on the system .",
    "it is expected that the response of the system will correspond to the frequency of the oscillatory shear .",
    "however in the case of oscillatory shear , the response of the system might not be as isotropic as compared to our mode of deformation .",
    "finally our model also represents a unique example of active matter where the system is driven with a characteristic driving frequency @xmath34 .",
    "comparison of our actively oscillating particle system to the more mainstream self - propelled active particle system  @xcite might also be illuminating , since self - propelled particles do not possess such a characteristic vibrational frequency .    in conclusion , by means of our new method to excite the specific modes , we have acquired results consistent with those of the normal mode analysis . here",
    "the numerical costs for our new method is much lower than the normal mode analysis because we do not need to diagonalize a huge hessian matrix .",
    "this makes us possible to perform vibrational analysis for much larger systems in near future , which will significantly contribute to the studies of the vibrational properties in any solids including soft materials .",

    "<S> we propose a new method to characterize the spatial distribution of particles vibrations in solids with much lower computational costs compared to the usual normal mode analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we excite the specific vibrational mode in a two dimensional athermal jammed system by giving a small amplitude of active oscillation to each particle s size with an identical driving frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the response is then obtained as the real time displacements of the particles . </S>",
    "<S> we show remarkable correlations between the real time displacements and the eigen vectors obtained from conventional normal mode analysis . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , from these real time displacements , we can measure the participation ratio and spatial polarization of particles vibrations . from these measurements , </S>",
    "<S> we find three distinct frequency regimes which characterize the spatial distribution and correlation of particles vibrations in jammed amorphous solids . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we can possibly apply this method to a much larger system to examine the low frequency behaviour of amorphous solids with a much higher resolution of the frequency space . </S>"
