    "more than fifty high mass star forming cores were observed with sharc ( submillimeter high angular resolution camera ; hunter , benford , & serabyn 1996 ) during 5 nights in 1997 ( december 21 and 22 ) and 1998 ( july 15 , 23 , and 25 ) on the 10.4 m caltech submillimeter telescope .",
    "sharc is a 1d bolometer array with a fwhm beam size of 11 .",
    "the objects were selected from the sample of plume , jaffe , & evans ( 1992 ) of massive star forming cores associated with water masers .",
    "we have plotted the 350  contour maps and normalized radial intensity profiles for each source .",
    "figure 1 shows the 350  map and the radial profile with the best - fit model for m8e .",
    "the radial intensity profiles and seds were modeled using a one - dimensional dust continuum radiative transfer code by egan , leung , and spagna ( 1988 ) and an observation simulation code ( evans et al .",
    "we assumed a power law density distribution of the form @xmath4 , for @xmath5 .",
    "for each of our models , we adjusted the input density so that the model flux at 350  matched the observed flux and adjusted the internal luminosity to match the observed bolometric luminosity .",
    "we adopted dust opacities from ossenkopf & henning ( 1994 , column 5 ) that are calculated for aggregated dust grains with ice mantles as our standard .",
    "the fit of the models with the observations was quantified by calculation of a reduced chi - squared , @xmath6 .",
    "the internal luminosities of our sources ranged from 10@xmath7 to 10@xmath8 l@xmath3 .",
    "for all the modeled sources , we have calculated an integrated mass using the best - fit density power law .",
    "the mean mass within the half - power radius is 209 m@xmath3 .",

    "we were unable to reliably model sources with small angular sizes or double peaks , and those cores are not included in our statistics .",
    "the mean power law is significantly steeper ( about 0.4 ) than the average density law exponent found by van der tak et al .",
