    "we introduced a model for treating the dynamics of a molecule with an induced dipole moment in the presence of an external electric field .",
    "we showed that the classical dynamics is equivalent to the mean - field quantum dynamics of the system .",
    "the dynamics is more complicated than the dynamics of a magnetic dipole moment in a magnetic field ; modeling the dynamics requires equations of motion for _ both _ the angular momentum operator @xmath107 and the operator for the unit vector in the direction of the axis of the molecule , @xmath108 .",
    "then , we considered the dynamics in the presence of an external electric field that is a sum of a deterministic field and a stochastically fluctuating field ( noise ) . for simplicity , we took the fluctuations to be gaussian white noise .",
    "the model makes the external noise assumption @xcite wherein no back - action of the system on the environment is present . using perturbation theory for the stochastic field , the @xmath12 component of the average induced electric dipole moment , @xmath109 , and the @xmath12 component of the average angular momentum , @xmath110 , do not decay ( decohere ) to zero , despite fluctuations in all three components of the electric field , ( but the other components of these vectors do decohere ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the decay of the average over fluctuations of a magnetic moment , which does decohere to zero in a stochastic magnetic field with gaussian white noise in all three components @xcite . in contradistinction to the perturbative analysis , i.e. , upon including the term nonlinear in the stochastic field in the equations of motion , we find that decoherence occurs in all three components of @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "moreover , decoherence of the transverse components of these vectors appears significantly earlier than in the perturbation theory solutions .",
    "these predictions , obtained under the external noise assumption , should be able to be readily checked experimentally .",
    "these predictions should remain valid also for gaussian colored noise stochastic processes , as long as the temporal correlation time of the colored noise process , @xmath113 , is short compared with the rotation time of the molecule , @xmath114 , and the stark timescale , @xmath115 .",
