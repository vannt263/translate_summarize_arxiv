    "it is well known that x - ray surveys are an extremely efficient tool to select active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "for example in the _ xmm - newton _ cosmos survey , at the 0.5 - 2 kev limiting flux of 7@xmath310@xmath4 erg s@xmath5 @xmath6 , the agn surface density is @xmath01000 deg@xmath7 ( hasinger et al .",
    "2007 , cappelluti et al . 2007 ) , a factor 2 - 4 greater than the agn surface density in the most recent deep optical surveys , 250 deg@xmath7 in the combo-17 ( wolf et al . 2003 ) and 470 deg@xmath7 in vvds survey ( gavignaud et al . 2006 ) . there are four main causes for the higher efficiency of x - ray surveys in finding agn : 1 ) x - rays directly trace the super massive black hole ( smbh ) accretion , while agn classification trough optical line spectroscopy may suffer of uncompleteness and/or misidentifications ; 2 ) agn are the dominant x - ray population .",
    "in fact most ( @xmath0 80% ) of the x - ray sources agn in deep and shallow surveys turn out to be agn , unlike at optical wavelengths .",
    "3 ) 0.5 - 10 kev x - rays ( the typical _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ enery band ) are capable to penetrate column densities up to @xmath010@xmath8 @xmath6 , allowing the selection of moderately obscured agn ; 4 ) low luminosity agn are difficult to select in optical surveys , because their light is diluted in the host galaxy emission .",
    "so far _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ have performed several deep , pencil beam , and shallower but wider surveys .",
    "[ surveys ] compares the flux limit and area coverage of the main _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ surveys .",
    "this figure shows that _ xmm - newton _ cosmos and _ chandra_-cosmos ( c - cosmos , elvis et al .",
    "2009 , paper i hereafter ) surveys are the deepest surveys on large contiguous area .",
    "the coverage of larger areas at similar flux limits is today achieved only by serendipitous surveys using mostly not contiguous areas ( see e.g. , champ , kim et al .",

    "2007 ) is aimed at studying the interplay between the large scale structure ( lss ) in the universe and the formation of galaxies , dark matter , and agn .",
    "the cosmos field is located near the equator ( 10h,+02degrees ) , covers @xmath0  2 square degrees as originally defined by the hst / acs imaging ( koekemoer et al .",
    "2007 ) , with subsequent deep and extended multi - wavelength coverage overlapping this area .",
    "the size of cosmos was chosen to sample lss up to a linear size of about 50 mpc h@xmath5 at z  @xmath0  1 - 2 , where agn and star formation in galaxies are expected to peak . to study the role of agn in galaxy evolution",
    "the x - ray data are fundamental .",
    "therefore , the central square degree of the cosmos field has been the target of a _",
    "acis - i , 1.8  msec very large program : the _ chandra_-cosmos survey .",
    "the c - cosmos survey has a rather uniform effective exposure of @xmath9  ksec over a large area ( @xmath0  0.45 deg@xmath1 ) , thus reaching @xmath0  3.5 times fainter fluxes than xmm - cosmos in both 0.5 - 2 kev band and 2 - 7 kev band .",
    "this flux limit is below the threshold where starburst galaxies become common in x - rays .",
    "the sharp _ chandra _ point spread function ( psf ) allows nearly unambiguous identification of optical counterparts ( civano et al .",
    "2009 , hereafter paper iii)._chandra _ secures the identifications of x - ray sources down to faint optical magnitude ( i.e. , i  @xmath0  26 ) , with only @xmath0  2% ambiguous identifications , significantly better than the @xmath10 ambiguous identifications in xmm - newton ( brusa et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the c - cosmos survey has a complex tiling ( see fig .",
    "[ overlay ] ) in comparison to other x - ray surveys , in which the overlapping areas of the single pointings are small and with similar psfs ( see e.g. , the extended groth - streep , aegis - x , laird et al .",
    "2009 ) , or all the pointings are co - assial and nearly totally overlapping ( see e.g. , cdfs , giacconi et al .",
    "2001 , luo et al .",
    "2008 ) . in the c - cosmos tiling ,",
    "the pointings are strongly overlapping and not - coassial .",
    "while this ensures a very uniform sensitivity over most of the field , each source is observed with up to six different psfs , requiring the development of an analysis procedure for data observed with this mixture of psf .",
    "the procedures presented in this paper are aimed at optimizing ( 1 ) source detection , ( 2 ) localization , ( 3 ) photometry , and ( 4 ) survey sensitivity .",
    "we have made detailed comparisons between different detection algorithms and photometry tools , testing them extensively on simulated data .",
    "we furthermore validate our results by detailed inspections of each single source candidate .",
    "our final analysis consists of a two main steps :    * , _ pwdetect _ ( damiani et al . 1997 ) is first used to find source candidates .",
    "this algorithm is optimized to cleanly separate nearby sources , to detect point - like sources on top of extended emission and to give the most accurate positions .",
    "* is then used to evaluate the source count rates and the probability that each source candidate is not a fluctuation of the background .",
    "we used the _ emldetect _ algorithm ( cappelluti et al .",
    "2007 and references therein ) .",
    "_ emldetect _ works simultaneously with multiple overlapping pointings using psfs appropriate to each one .",
    "this fitting method ensures accurate evaluation of the survey completeness and contamination , efficient deblending and good photometry for close pairs , which may be partly blended even at the _ chandra _ resolution .    as a third step",
    ", we also performed for each candidate x - ray source using 50% , 90% , and 95% encircled count fractions , using the psfs appropriate to each observation .",
    "the aperture photometry is also used to check the results .",
    "aperture photometry is preferable in all cases where the systematic error introduced by psf fitting are larger than the statistical errors , i.e. , for bright sources ( count rates @xmath11 counts / ksec ) .",
    "the survey sensitivity is limited by both the net ( i.e. , including vignetting ) exposure time , and by the actual psf with which a given region of the area is observed .",
    "the latter issue is particularly relevant for the c - cosmos tiling .",
    "we have developed an algorithm that evaluates the survey sensitivity at each position on c - cosmos using a parameterization of the _ chandra _ acis - i psf and taking into account the mixture of psfs at each position .",
    "the resulting sensitivity maps have been compared and validated with extensive simulations .",

    "this choice spans the range from the smallest to the largest ( for large @xmath37 ) _ chandra _ psfs .",
    "both radial and azimuthal psf variations are accounted for by _ pwdetect _ , which first assumes a gaussian psf and then corrects by a psf shape factor , calibrated on both radial and azimuthal coordinates .",

    ", the lower number of spurious detections in c - cosmos with respect to aegis - x at a given significance level is due to the fact that each field is observed more than once at different off - axis angles and therefore with different psfs .",
    "the complex tiling of c - cosmos survey required the development of a tailored multistep procedure to fully exploit the data .",
    "detailed simulations were used to test different detection ( sliding cell and wavelet ) and photometry ( psf fitting and aperture photometry ) algorithms . in particular , we compared the results obtained using the sas _ eboxdetect _ and _ emldetect _ tasks , used for the xmm - cosmos survey ( cappelluti et al .",
    "2007 , 2009 ) , with those obtained using the _ pwdetect _ code ( damiani et al . 1997 ) . through these tests we selected a procedure",
    "consisting in first identifying source candidates using _ pwdetect _ , and then performing accurate psf fitting photometry and evaluating aperture photometry for each source candidate . in this way we obtained subarcsec source localizations and accurate photometry even for partly blended sources .",
    "we set a threshold for source detection to @xmath68 , which implies a completeness of 87.5% and 68% for sources with at least 12 and 7 f band counts , respectively , and 3 to 5 spurious detections in the f band at the same count limits , respectively .",
    "we evaluated the survey sensitivity and the sky - coverage , through an analytical method , tuned using simulations .",

    "we found that the complex tiling of c - cosmos helps in obtaining a contiguous area with uniform sensitivity and somewhat higher source density .",
    "the overlap of several pointings with different psf at the same position produces an effective source extraction region of @xmath0  3 arcsec radius , i.e. , significantly wider than the chandra psf at off - axis angles smaller than 5 - 6 arcmin .",

    "<S> the _ chandra _ cosmos survey ( c - cosmos ) is a large , 1.8 ms , _ chandra _ program , that covers the central contiguous @xmath0  0.92 deg@xmath1 of the cosmos field . </S>",
    "<S> c - cosmos is the result of a complex tiling , with every position being observed in up to six overlapping pointings ( four overlapping pointings in most of the central @xmath0  0.45 deg@xmath1 area with the best exposure , and two overlapping pointings in most of the surrounding area , covering an additional @xmath0  0.47 deg@xmath1 ) . therefore , the full exploitation of the c - cosmos data requires a dedicated and accurate analysis focused on three main issues : 1 ) maximizing the sensitivity when the psf changes strongly among different observations of the same source ( from @xmath0  1 arcsec up to @xmath2 arcsec half power radius ) ; 2 ) resolving close pairs ; and 3 ) obtaining the best source localization and count rate . </S>",
    "<S> we present here our treatment of four key analysis items : source detection , localization , photometry , and survey sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> our final procedure consists of a two step procedure : ( 1 ) a wavelet detection algorithm , to find source candidates , ( 2 ) a maximum likelihood point spread function fitting algorithm to evaluate the source count rates and the probability that each source candidate is a fluctuation of the background . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the main characteristics of this procedure , that was the result of detailed comparisons between different detection algorithms and photometry tools , calibrated with extensive and dedicated simulations . </S>"
