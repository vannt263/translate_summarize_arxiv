    "the classification of finite - dimensional simple lie algebras by cartan and killing is one of the mile stones of modern mathematics .",
    "the study of these algebras is essentially reduced to that of root systems and their weyl groups , and all their geometric content is contained in cartan matrices and visualised in dynkin diagrams .",
    "the problem ultimately amounts to classifying all possible cartan matrices @xcite .",
    "coxeter groups describe ( generalised ) reflections @xcite , and thus encompass the above weyl groups , which are the reflective symmetry groups of the relevant root systems .",
    "in fact , the finite coxeter groups are precisely the finite euclidean reflection groups @xcite . however , since the root systems arising in lie theory are related to lattices , the weyl groups are automatically crystallographic in nature .",
    "non - crystallographic coxeter groups , i.e. those that do not stabilise any lattice ( in the dimension equal to their rank ) , therefore can not arise in the lie theory context , and as a consequence , they have not been studied as intensely .",
    "they include the groups @xmath5 , @xmath4 and the largest non - crystallographic group @xmath3 ; the icosahedral group @xmath4 and its rotational subgroup @xmath6 are of particular practical importance as @xmath4 is the largest discrete symmetry group of physical space .",
    "thus , many 3-dimensional systems with ` maximal symmetry ' , like viruses in biology @xcite , fullerenes in chemistry @xcite and quasicrystals in physics @xcite , can be modeled using coxeter groups .",
    "affine lie algebras have also been studied for a long time , and many of the salient features of the theory of simple lie algebras carry over to the affine case .",
    "more recently , kac - moody theory has provided another framework in which generalised cartan matrices induce interesting algebraic structures that preserve many of the features encountered in the simple and affine cases @xcite .",
    "however , such considerations again only give rise to extensions of crystallographic coxeter groups .",
    "these infinite coxeter groups are usually constructed directly from the finite coxeter groups by introducing affine reflection planes ( planes not containing the origin ) . while these infinite counterparts to the crystallographic coxeter groups have been intensely studied @xcite , much less is known about their non - crystallographic counterparts @xcite .",
    "recently , we have derived novel affine extensions of the non - crystallographic coxeter groups @xmath5 , @xmath4 and @xmath3 in two , three and four dimensions , based on an extension of their cartan matrices following the kac - moody formalism in lie theory @xcite . in this paper , we develop a different approach and induce such affine extensions of the non - crystallographic groups @xmath5 , @xmath4 and @xmath3 from affine extensions of the crystallographic groups @xmath2 , @xmath1 and @xmath0 , via projection from the higher - dimensional setting . specifically , there exists a projection from the root system of @xmath0 , the largest exceptional lie algebra , to the root system of @xmath3 , the largest non - crystallographic coxeter group @xcite , and , due to the inclusions @xmath7 and @xmath8 , also corresponding projections for the other non - crystallographic coxeter groups .",
    "we apply these projections here to the extended root systems of the groups @xmath2 , @xmath1 and @xmath0 . as expected , extending by a single node recovers only those affine extensions known in the literature .",
    "however , we also consider simply - laced extensions with two additional nodes in the kac - moody formalism , and consider their compatibility with the projection formalism .",
    "specifically , we use the projection of the affine root as an affine root for the projected root system , and thereby find a distinguished subset of the solutions in the classification scheme presented in @xcite .    the @xmath0 root system , and the related structures : the @xmath0 lattice , the coxeter group , the lie algebra and the lie group , are ` exceptional ' structures , and are of critical importance in mathematics and in theoretical physics @xcite .",
    "for instance , they occur in the context of lie algebras , simple group theory and modular form theory , as well as lattice packing theory @xcite . in theoretical physics , @xmath0 is central to string theory , as it is the gauge group for the @xmath9 heterotic string @xcite .",
    "more recently , via the hoava - witten picture @xcite and other developments @xcite , @xmath0 and its affine extensions and overextensions ( e.g. @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) have emerged as the most likely candidates for the underlying symmetry of m - theory .",
    "it is also fundamental in the context of grand unified theories @xcite , as it is the largest irreducible group that can accommodate the standard model gauge group @xmath12 .",
    "our new link between affine extensions of crystallographic coxeter groups such as @xmath10 and their non - crystallographic counterparts could thus turn out to be important in high energy physics , e.g. in string theory or in possible extensions of the standard model above the tev scale after null findings at the lhc .",

    "section [ sec_cox ] discusses the basics of coxeter groups .",

    "we also discuss how lifting affine extensions of non - crystallographic groups to the crystallographic setting , as well as symmetrisability of the resulting matrices , motivate a study of cartan matrices over extended number fields .",

    "a _ coxeter group _ is a group generated by some involutive generators @xmath13 subject to relations of the form @xmath14 with @xmath15 for @xmath16 .",
    "the matrix @xmath17 with entries @xmath18 is called the _",
    "coxeter matrix_.    the finite coxeter groups have a geometric representation where the involutions are realised as reflections at hyperplanes through the origin in a euclidean vector space @xmath19 .",
    "in particular , let @xmath20 denote the inner product in @xmath19 , and @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "the generator @xmath23 corresponds to the _ reflection _ @xmath24 at a hyperplane perpendicular to the _ root vector _ @xmath25 .",
    "the action of the coxeter group is to permute these root vectors , and its structure is thus encoded in the collection @xmath26 of all such root vectors , the root system :    a _ root system _ @xmath27 is a finite set of non - zero vectors in @xmath19 such that the following two conditions hold :    1 .",
    "@xmath27 only contains a root @xmath25 and its negative , but no other scalar multiples : @xmath28 .",
    "2 .   @xmath27 is invariant under all reflections corresponding to vectors in @xmath27 : @xmath29 .    for a crystallographic coxeter group , a subset @xmath30 of @xmath27 , called _ simple roots _ ,",
    "is sufficient to express every element of @xmath27 via a @xmath31-linear combination with coefficients of the same sign .",
    "@xmath27 is therefore completely characterised by this basis of simple roots , which in turn completely characterises the coxeter group . in the case of the non - crystallographic coxeter groups",
    "@xmath5 , @xmath4 and @xmath3 , the same holds for the extended integer ring @xmath32=\\lbrace a+\\tau b| a , b \\in \\mathbb{z}\\rbrace$ ] , where @xmath33 is the golden ratio @xmath34 .",
    "note that together with its galois conjugate @xmath35 , @xmath33 satisfies the quadratic equation @xmath36 . in the following",
    ", we will call the exchange of @xmath33 and @xmath37 _ galois conjugation _ , and denote it by @xmath38 .",
    "the structure of the set of simple roots is encoded in the cartan matrix , which contains the geometrically invariant information of the root system as follows :    the _ cartan matrix _ of a set of simple roots @xmath39 is defined as the matrix @xmath40 a graphical representation of the geometric content is given by _",
    "coxeter - dynkin diagrams _ , in which nodes correspond to simple roots , orthogonal roots are not connected , roots at @xmath41 have a simple link , and other angles @xmath42 have a link with a label @xmath43 .    note that cartan matrix entries of @xmath33 and @xmath37 yield coxeter diagram labels of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively , since in the simply - laced setting @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "such fractional values can also be understood as angles in hyperbolic space @xcite . by the crystallographic restriction theorem , there are no lattices ( i.e. periodic structures ) with such non - crystallographic symmetry @xmath5 , @xmath4 and @xmath3 in two , three and four dimensions , respectively",
    ". for these non - crystallographic coxeter groups one therefore needs to move from a lattice to a quasilattice setting .      the largest exceptional ( crystallographic ) coxeter group @xmath0 and the largest non - crystallographic coxeter group @xmath3 are closely related .",
    "this connection between @xmath0 and @xmath3 can be exhibited in various ways , including coxeter - dynkin diagram foldings in the coxeter group picture @xcite , relating the root systems @xcite , and in terms of the representation theory @xcite . for illustrative purposes ,",
    "we focus on the folding picture first .",
    "following @xcite , we consider the dynkin diagram of @xmath0 ( top left of fig .",
    "[ fige8 ] ) , where we have labeled the simple roots @xmath49 to @xmath50 .",
    "we fold the diagram suggestively ( bottom left of fig . [ fige8 ] ) , and define the combinations @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "it can be shown that the subgroup with the generators @xmath55 is in fact isomorphic to @xmath3 ( top right ) @xcite .",
    "this amounts to demanding that the simple roots of @xmath0 project onto the simple roots of @xmath3 and their @xmath33-multiples , as denoted on the bottom right of fig .",
    "[ fige8 ] .",
    "one choice of simple roots for @xmath3 is @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and in that case the highest root is @xmath60 . in the bases of simple roots @xmath61 and @xmath62 , the projection is given by @xmath63    there are similar diagrams for @xmath2 and @xmath1 that can be obtained from the @xmath0 diagram by deleting nodes .",
    "we display these in fig .",
    "[ figd6 ] in order to set out our notation , as the conventional way of numbering the roots in the dynkin diagrams differs from the natural numbering in the folding picture .",
    "the only non - trivial coxeter relation is the one corresponding to the 5-fold rotation ( e.g. the relation between @xmath64 and @xmath65 for the case of @xmath0 ) .",
    "the additional @xmath66-generators in the higher - dimensional cases are trivial , as they can be straightforwardly shown to satisfy the relevant coxeter relations ( corresponding to 3-fold rotations ) directly from the original coxeter relations for the @xmath61s of the larger groups .",
    "it has been observed that the @xmath0 root vectors can be realised in terms of unit quaternions with coefficients in @xmath32 $ ] @xcite .",
    "specifically , the set of 120 icosians forms a discrete group under standard quaternionic multiplication , and is a realisation of the @xmath3 root system @xcite .",
    "the 240 roots of @xmath0 have been shown to be in 1 - 1-correspondence with the 120 icosians and their 120 @xmath33-multiples , so that , schematically , @xmath67 holds .",
    "the projection considered above therefore exhibits this mapping of the simple roots of @xmath0 onto the simple roots of @xmath3 and their @xmath33-multiples .",
    "corresponding results hold for the other groups @xmath1 and @xmath4 , as well as @xmath2 and @xmath5 by inclusion .    from a group theoretic point of view , @xmath0 has two conjugate @xmath3-invariant subspaces . following the terminology in @xcite , we make the following definition .",
    "we denote by the _ standard representation _ of a coxeter group the representation generated by mirrors forming angles @xmath68 , where @xmath69 are the entries of the coxeter matrix , i.e. @xmath44 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 for the cases relevant here .",
    "one can also achieve a _",
    "non - standard representation _ of the coxeter groups @xmath72 by instead taking mirrors at angles @xmath73 , i.e. by schematically going from a pentagon to a pentagram .",
    "note that these therefore have coxeter diagram labels of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "these are non - equivalent irreducible representations of the non - crystallographic coxeter groups , i.e. there is no similarity transformation that takes one to the other .",
    "their characters are exchanged under the galois automorphism @xmath74 , and the simple roots in the non - standard representation are the galois conjugates of the simple roots of the standard representation , for instance @xmath75 .",
    "this different set of simple roots @xmath76 yields a cartan matrix that is the galois conjugate of the cartan matrix of the simple roots @xmath77 , and leads to the label of @xmath45 in the coxeter diagram .",
    "however , in this finite - dimensional case the groups generated by the two sets of generators are isomorphic , as both sets of roots give rise to the same root system , but positioned differently in space .",
    "the non - trivial coxeter relations are therefore in both cases @xmath14 with @xmath78 for @xmath79 .",
    "hence the coxeter matrix is identical in both cases ; in particular , it is still symmetric .",
    "therefore , one usually restricts analysis to the standard - representation , where the simple roots form obtuse angles , and whose cartan matrix therefore satisfies the usual negativity requirements .",
    "the projection @xmath80 into the second @xmath3-invariant subspace in terms of the bases @xmath61 and @xmath76 is the galois conjugate of @xmath81 in eq .",
    "( [ projpi ] ) , which , however , is with respect to the bases @xmath61 and @xmath77 .",

    "for a crystallographic coxeter group , an affine coxeter group can be constructed by defining affine hyperplanes @xmath85 as solutions to the equations @xmath86 , where @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 @xcite .",

    "this completes the proof .    as is well known @xcite , the affine extensions of crystallographic coxeter groups result in a ( periodic ) tessellation of the fundamental domain of the unextended group in terms of copies of the fundamental domain of the affine group . in contrast , affine extended non - crystallographic groups inherit the full fundamental domain of the unextended group .",
    "the fundamental domain of these extensions however still has the interesting property of being tessellated , but in this case the tiling is _ aperiodic _ , and hence the fundamental domain again has a non - trivial mathematical structure .    in order to further explore this interesting relation with quasilattices , we begin by introducing some terminology @xcite .",
    "we recall that a generic affine non - crystallographic coxeter group @xmath165 is generated by the @xmath166s from section [ sec_cox ] together with the translation @xmath167 that we identified in definition [ defaffcox ] .",
    "[ defqcf ] let @xmath27 denote the root polytope of the non - crystallographic coxeter group @xmath72 , and let @xmath168 denote the set of all _ words _",

    "the set of points @xmath170 is called an _",
    "@xmath165-induced quasicrystal fragment _ ; @xmath171 is the _ cut - off - parameter_. the _ cardinality _ of such a quasicrystal fragment will be denoted by @xmath172 , and a generic translation yields the maximal cardinality @xmath173 .",
    "we will say that a quasicrystal fragment with less than maximal cardinality _ has coinciding / degenerate points / vertices _ and we call the corresponding translation _ distinguished_. this degeneracy implies _ non - trivial relations _ @xmath174 ( for @xmath175 ) amongst the ( words in the ) generators .",
    "the set of points @xmath176 will denote the _ shell _ of the quasicrystal fragment determined by the words that contain @xmath167 precisely @xmath171 times .",
    ".[tabfibcard ] cardinalities of extended root systems / quasicrystal fragments depending on translation length . here , we list cardinalities @xmath177 of the point sets achieved by extending the @xmath72 root systems by an affine reflection along the highest root @xmath178 for various values of @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath179 corresponds to the simply - laced affine extension @xmath180 that was considered in @xcite .",
    "the induced extensions @xmath181 and @xmath182 considered here correspond to @xmath183 and @xmath184 , respectively , and yield the same cardinality .",
    "@xmath185 is also an affine extension corresponding to @xmath184 , and is contained in the solutions found in @xcite .",
    "we will discuss how this could be lifted to the higher - dimensional case in section [ sec_concl ] .",
    "we note that all three translations in each case are distinguished , i.e. they give rise to less than maximal cardinality .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have shown that via affine extensions of the crystallographic root systems @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( upper arrow in fig . [ edah_overview ] ) and subsequent projection ( dashed arrow ) , one obtains affine extensions of the non - crystallographic groups @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 of the type considered in @xcite ( lower arrow ) .",
    "this provides an alternative construction of affine extensions of this type , and by placing them into the broader context of the crystallographic group @xmath0 , we open up new potential applications in lie theory , modular form theory and high energy physics .",
    "the ten induced extensions derived here are a subset of the extensions in the fibonacci classification scheme derived in @xcite .",
    "the fibonacci classification contains an infinity of solutions of which the ones derived here are thus a subset distinguished by the projection . for the simply - laced cases , the induced extensions @xmath186 and @xmath182 ( since this is equivalent to @xmath187 ) can be derived from the symmetric solutions @xmath180 from @xcite via rescaling with @xmath33 and are in that sense the ` first ' asymmetric members of the corresponding fibonacci families of solutions .",
    "these distinguished affine extensions could thus have a special rle in practical applications , e.g. in quasicrystal theory , virology and carbon chemistry .",
    "the induced extensions are @xmath32$]-valued in the simply - laced cases , and @xmath152$]-valued for the other two non - simply - laced cases .",
    "this suggests to further generalise the kac - moody framework of @xcite to allow extended number fields in the entries in the extended cartan matrices of @xmath5 , @xmath4 and @xmath3 ; this could be @xmath152 $ ] , but a milder extension might also suffice .",
    "one could therefore argue to also allow corresponding generalisations in the extended cartan matrices of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , from which the non - crystallographic cases are obtained via projection .",
    "such a generalisation might lead to interesting mathematical structures and could open up novel applications in hyperbolic geometry and rational conformal field theory , where similar fractional values can occur @xcite .",
    "various other approaches hint at this same generalisation , which we now explore in turn .    in particular , the projection ( left arrow in fig .",
    "[ edah_overview ] ) is in fact one - to - one , since integer cartan matrix entries in the higher - dimensional setting project onto @xmath32$]-integers in half the number of dimensions , and the two parts in a @xmath32$]-integer do not mix .",
    "this is due to the irrationality of the projection angle , which projects a lattice in higher dimensions to an aperiodic quasilattice in lower dimensions , without a null space of the same dimension .",
    "thus , one can invert the projection by ` lifting ' the affine roots and thereby cartan matrices of the non - crystallographic groups considered in the fibonacci classification in @xcite to those of the crystallographic groups ( i.e. by inverting the dashed arrow ) .",
    "we now lift ( denoted by @xmath188 ) such extended cartan matrices of @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 in order to determine what type of extensions of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 could induce them via projection ( denoted by @xmath189 ) .",
    "again , we denote generic extensions @xmath10 , @xmath190 and @xmath191 by their additional row and column vector in the cartan matrix",
    "as follows    @xmath192    we begin by lifting the affine extensions @xmath180 from @xcite , which are the symmetric special cases in the fibonacci families of solutions .",
    "one might have thought intuitively that these @xmath180 would arise via projection , rather than the @xmath181 .",
    "it is thus interesting to lift the affine roots of the @xmath180 to the higher - dimensional setting and to see which cartan matrix they would therefore give rise to .",
    "for example , for @xmath193 the vectors giving the additional row and column in the cartan matrix are given by @xmath194 similarly , the vectors corresponding to @xmath195 and @xmath196 are given by @xmath197 and @xmath198 , respectively .",
    "we note that the lifted versions of the symmetric extensions @xmath180 are also symmetric . however , the requirement of non - positivity of the off - diagonal cartan matrix entries that is usual in the lie algebra context is not satisfied by these matrices .",
    "this is in agreement with the fact that the only standard affine extensions of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the five cases presented in section [ sec_std_single ] .",
    "the lifted versions of @xmath180 could thus motivate to relax this requirement of non - positivity in order to arrive at an interesting more general class of cartan matrices .",
    "analogously , one can consider lifting the transposes of the cartan matrices obtained earlier that are induced from @xmath81 ( c.f . equations ( [ carh4affas])-([carh2affas ] ) ) , e.g. @xmath199 .",
    "in particular , they are also contained in the fibonacci classification of affine extensions in @xcite ( see section [ sec_sum ] ) .",
    "they are in fact also related to the extensions induced by @xmath80 , since they give rise to equivalent compact parts with the same translation lengths .",
    "for example , lifting the transpose @xmath199 of @xmath200 in eq .",
    "( [ carh4affas ] ) gives the following matrix in 9d @xmath201 where we have denoted the combination of projecting the affine extension of @xmath0 , transposing , and lifting again , by @xmath202 .",
    "we note that there are again positive , but now also fractional entries  neither occurs in the context of simple lie theory .",
    "we also observe that the consistency conditions ( the lemma in @xcite ) stipulated in our previous paper are still obeyed",
    ". one may find rational entries surprising , but these actually arise naturally in the context of the affine extensions considered in the non - crystallographic setting @xcite , e.g. @xmath121 .",
    "perhaps , therefore generalising integer to rational entries also in the higher - dimensional crystallographic case could lead to interesting new mathematical structures .",
    "the other cases correponding to @xmath107 , @xmath109 , @xmath105 and @xmath111 are given by @xmath203 , @xmath204 , @xmath205 , and @xmath206 , respectively .",
    "in an analogous manner , one could proceed to lift all the solutions in the fibonacci family rather than just @xmath180 and @xmath207 , but these instructive examples shall suffice to give some indication towards the generalisations that arise .    as explained in definition [ defsym ] in section [ sec_proj_aff ] , in the coxeter group and lie algebra contexts , one is often interested in symmetrisable cartan matrices .",
    "for completeness , we therefore present here the symmetrised version of @xmath208 , which we denote by @xmath209 , as an example of which type of matrix arises through symmetrisation @xmath210 here we have relaxed the requirement that the symmetrised matrix be integer - valued , since even before symmetrisation , the cartan matrix has fractional values .",
    "again , positive and fractional values arise .",
    "this matrix is positive semi - definite , which was expected as that corresponds to the affine case .",
    "thus , even the criterion of symmetrisability suggests positive entries and extending the number field for the cartan matrix entries to @xmath152 $ ] or @xmath32+\\frac{1}{2}\\mathbb{z}[\\tau]$ ] .    in summary",
    ", we have provided a novel , alternative construction of affine extensions of the type considered in @xcite from the two familiar concepts of affine extensions of crystallographic groups and projection of root systems . this construction results in a special subset of the point arrays used in mathematical virology and carbon chemistry that is distinguished via the projection , which could therefore play a special rle in applications .",
    "it also extends the quasicrystal framework considered in @xcite to a wider class of quasicrystals .",
    "we furthermore made the case for admitting extended number fields in the cartan matrix .",
    "these extended number fields arise in a variety of cases , namely in the lower - dimensional picture @xcite , via projection , via lifting the fibonacci family of solutions ( including @xmath180 from @xcite and transposes of @xmath181 ) and via symmetrising .",
    "fractional entries in cartan matrices arise in hyperbolic geometry and rational conformal field theory .",
    "our construction here is thus another example of such fractional entries that could open up a new type of analysis and enticing possibilities in these fields .",
