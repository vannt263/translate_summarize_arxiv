    "the @xmath4 cold dark matter ( @xmath4cdm ) model predicts an abundance of substructure on all ( observable ) mass scales .",
    "hundreds of subhalos are predicted to surround milky way ( mw ) mass halos ( @xcite ) , which can be likened to a scaled down version of the thousands of substructures associated with clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "this trend , presumably , continues to smaller mass scales , whereby dwarf galaxies can also host several substructures .",
    "recent discoveries of dwarf - dwarf accretion @xcite present tantalizing observational evidence for the existence of such `` sub - structure of sub - structure '' .    despite the hierarchical nature of dark matter halos",
    ", we generally ignore the possibility that some of the mw satellites may have been part of a group of subhalos before they fell into the galaxy .",
    "the relatively unexplored population of sub - subhalos or `` satellites of satellites '' is strongly linked to the most massive structures in the mw halo , as these are the potential vehicles that dragged in several low mass dwarfs .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that a significant fraction ( @xmath5 % ) of low - mass subhalos ( @xmath6 ) likely fell into a mw - type host as a satellite of a more massive subhalo , and @xmath7 were in a group before infall .",
    "the most likely culprit in our own galaxy is the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "this massive dwarf already has one obvious companion , the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , but it likely had several other companions in the past .",
    "numerous works have attempted to connect the lmc to other known dwarfs in the mw . @xcite",
    "first suggested the idea of a `` greater magellanic galaxy '' , and he later postulated the association of several of the classical dwarfs with the magellanic complex ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite suggested that seven of the mw satellites could have been part of a late infalling lmc group .",
    "in contrast , @xcite use an lmc - analog `` case - study '' in a cosmological simulation to show that most of the classical dwarfs show little evidence for an association with the lmc . however , the authors do prophetically suggest that faint , previously unnoticed mw satellites could be lurking in the vicinity of the clouds .",
    "the discovery of very low luminosity galaxies ( @xmath8 ) in the mw ( e.g , @xcite ; @xcite ) has , until recently , been restricted to the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) footprint , as most of the `` ultra - faint '' dwarf population have been discovered using sdss imaging .",
    "however , uncharted territory beneath declination @xmath9 has recently been explored with the first data release of the dark energy survey ( des ) .",
    "two independent groups ( @xcite ; @xcite ) unveiled eight and nine candidate dwarf galaxies correspondingly in the des data .",
    "curiously , these satellites are mostly of the `` ultra - faint '' variety and are in close proximity to the lmc .",
    "in @xcite we showed that most of the past satellites of an lmc - mass dwarf are likely lower mass subhalos , likened to the ultra - faints .",
    "thus , the finding of several low luminosity dwarfs in close proximity to the lmc could potentially confirm a generic prediction of hierarchical structure formation . in this work ,",
    "we use cosmological simulations to study the satellite populations of lmc - mass dwarfs accreted onto mw / m31-mass halos , in order to understand the potential association between the newly discovered des satellites and the lmc in a cosmological context .",
    "to study the satellite populations of lmc - mass dwarfs , we use elvis ( exploring the local volume in simulations , @xcite ) , a suite of 48 high - resolution , zoom - in simulations of milky way / m31 mass halos ( @xmath10 ) . half of the elvis halos reside in a paired configuration with separations and relative velocities similar to those of the mw - m31 pair , while the remainder are highly isolated halos mass - matched to those in the pairs .    within the high - resolution ,",
    "zoom - in volumes ( spanning 2 - 5 mpc in size ) , the particle mass is @xmath11 and the plummer - equivalent force softening is 140 pc .",
    "elvis adopts a cosmological model based on _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _",
    "wmap7 @xcite , with the following @xmath4cdm parameters : @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "see @xcite for more details on elvis .",
    "dark matter subhalos are identified in elvis using the six - dimensional halo finder rockstar @xcite , and merger trees are constructed using the consistent - trees algorithm @xcite .    for each subhalo , we assign its primary progenitor ( main branch ) as the progenitor that contains the largest total mass summed from the subhalo masses over all preceding snapshots in that branch .",
    "we then compute the maximum ( peak ) mass , @xmath17 , ever reached by the main branch of a progenitor .    throughout this work ,",
    "we only consider subhalos with @xmath18 ( or @xmath19 ) ; @xcite found that subhalos down to this mass - threshold do not suffer from resolution and numerical disruption issues .",
    "( solid gray ) , and stellar mass , @xmath20 ( hashed green ) , for the 25 satellites with @xmath21 ( masses near that expected for the lmc ) in the mw / m31 hosts at @xmath0 in the elvis simulation suite .",
    "these are the ( surviving ) `` lmcs '' that we will discuss in the remainder of the paper .",
    "the dotted line indicates the observed stellar mass of the lmc.,width=302,height=241 ]      we select a sample of lmc - mass satellites of mw / m31 hosts at @xmath0 using all 48 ( paired and isolated ) halos in the elvis simulation suite .",
    "we select @xmath0 satellites with @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "this lower mass cut is approximately a factor of two lower than the lmc mass ( @xmath23 for @xmath24 , @xcite ) .",
    "stellar masses are estimated for the dark matter subhalos using the @xmath25 relation derived in @xcite .",
    "we exclude the satellite in the _ sonny & cher _ paired simulation that has a mass comparable to its host halo ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "a significant number of the host halos in elvis ( @xmath27% ) do not have _ any _ satellites more massive than @xmath28 , while some halos have more than one lmc satellite .",
    "it is unlikely that relatively low mass mw / m31 halos with @xmath29 host very massive satellites ( e.g. @xcite ) , so we are biased towards the more massive host halos in the elvis suite ( typically @xmath30 ) .",
    "we also note that some of the paired halos were selected to have a satellite companion with mass similar to the lmc ( @xmath31 , see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , our sample is not an unbiased ( random ) selection of mw / m31 mass hosts .",

    "[ fig : mlmc ] shows the distribution of their stellar and peak dark matter masses .       that were satellites of the surviving lmc dwarfs prior to its infall onto the mw / m31 host .",
    "the peak mass ( stellar mass ) of the lmcs is shown on the bottom ( top ) x - axis .",
    "the color scheme indicates the time since infall of the accretion events .",
    "recent and/or massive accretion events contribute significant numbers of `` satellites of satellites '' to the @xmath0 satellite population.,width=321,height=214 ]    [ fig : fsos ]    we trace back all @xmath0 satellites of mw / m31 hosts and identify those that were satellites of a surviving lmc dwarf anytime _ before _",
    "infall onto the mw / m31 hosts .",
    "we assume _ all _ subhalos with @xmath32 host luminous galaxies .",
    "we impose that a subhalo must remain a satellite for at least two consecutive time - steps ( @xmath33 myr ) in the simulations to avoid counting particularly transient ( and likely non - meaningful ) crossings just within @xmath34 .    note that the lmc dwarfs themselves are now also satellites of mw / m31 hosts , but prior to infall are the group centrals .    in total , we identify @xmath35 mw / m31 satellites today that were once satellites of lmc dwarfs , where these `` lmcs '' are still intact today .",
    "these `` satellites of satellites '' comprise approximately 7% of the surviving satellite population of mw / m31 hosts at @xmath0 , and have typical stellar masses of @xmath36 ( comparable to the ultra - faint dwarf galaxy population ) .",
    "this fraction is lower than in @xcite because we only consider the subset of satellites that were satellites of a",
    "_ _ surviving__. ] lmc satellite before infall . in this work , we only consider subhalos within the mw / m31 hosts today , and do not include `` field '' subhalos ( i.e. outside of @xmath34 today ) that could have been associated with an lmc - mass dwarf in the past .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that these associations do exist , and this could be an interesting population to study in future work .",
    "[ fig : fsos ] shows the fraction ( left panel ) and number ( right panel ) of @xmath0 satellites that were associated with a surviving lmc dwarf before infall onto the mw / m31 , against the mass of the group central .",
    "the color scheme indicates the infall time of the accretion events onto the mw / m31 hosts ( blue = recent infall , red = early infall )",
    ".    unsurprisingly , more massive dwarfs have more abundant satellite populations .",
    "there is also a dependence on infall time onto the mw / m31 host . at a given mass ,",
    "groups accreted more recently have more surviving members at @xmath0 .       between the lmc dwarfs and the satellites that were associated with them in a group before falling into the mw / m31 hosts , as a function of the distance of closest approach to the mw / m31 hosts ( @xmath37 , top panels ) and the @xmath0 distance between the lmc - mass dwarf and the mw / m31 ( @xmath38 , bottom panels ) .",
    "lmcs with larger pericenters tend to have smaller differences in phase space with their satellites today .",
    "however , there is a lot of scatter in this relation , particularly for dwarfs with @xmath39 kpc .",
    "for example , dwarfs with @xmath40 ( the approximate pericenter of the lmc , illustrated with the gray bands ) can have a wide range of infall times and phase - space differences .",
    "note that two dwarfs with @xmath41 kpc are shown as lower limits in these plots .",

    "[ fig : delta_vr ] we show the median velocity ( left panel ) and 3d distance ( right panels ) between the `` lmcs '' and their past group members as a function of infall time onto the mw / m31 hosts .",
    "we note that here , and throughout this work , we use infall time as an orbital constraint in our analysis .",
    "we find that infall time , rather than either the current distance from the mw / m31 host or orbital pericentric distance , shows the strongest relation with the dispersal of groups in phase - space ( see below and fig .",

    "we show the median difference in configuration space for satellites with @xmath44 kpc from the group central .",
    "this is a rough estimate for the maximum @xmath43 probed by the des survey around the lmc ( see @xcite fig .",
    "the proximity of the des satellites to the lmc is striking , especially compared to the general population of group members in the simulations .",
    "this proximity in configuration space not only suggests a likely association between the des dwarfs and the lmc , but , if several of these dwarfs are genuine group members , then it implies a very recent infall time for the lmc - group .",
    "note that the most recent observational constraints on the orbits of the lmc / smc suggest a recent infall time for this group ( see e.g , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "qualitatively , a picture similar to the above has been painted by the study of @xcite . however , here we present the first _ quantitative _ evidence of a pronounced correlation between @xmath0 scatter in the phase - space exhibited by the `` satellites of the satellites '' for a statistically significant sample of accretion configurations .    in fig .",

    "groups with smaller pericenters show a larger dispersal in phase - space , but the scatter between systems is large , particularly @xmath39 kpc . for pericenters similar to the observed closest approach of the lmc ( @xmath27 kpc ) , groups can be highly dispersed or can remain in close proximity at @xmath0 ( e.g. median @xmath45 kpc ) .",
    "we also note that lmc - mass dwarfs with pericenters close to the observed value of the lmc ( @xmath27 kpc ) , can have a wide range of infall times ( @xmath46 gyr ) .",
    "the trends with present day distance from the mw / m31 hosts are also relatively weak , particularly for dwarfs with @xmath47 kpc .",
