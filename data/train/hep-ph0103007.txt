    "it looks quite appealing to study central production processes with a large rapidity gap on either side in high energy hadron collisions . these embrace double - diffractive reactions generated by pomeron - pomeron  fusion , searches for new objects ( such as the higgs boson ) , and new approaches to study conventional physics , including the investigation of subtle aspects of qcd .",
    "equally interesting are other processes mediated by the colourless @xmath5-channel exchanges , especially the @xmath6-boson fusion reactions .",
    "one possibility , which at first sight looks attractive , is the search for the higgs boson in double rapidity gap events at proton colliders , see , for example , @xcite@xcite .",
    "this has become more important since lep is no longer available for higgs hunting .",
    "an obvious advantage of the rapidity gap approach is the spectacularly clean experimental signatures ( hadron - free zones between the remnants of the incoming protons and the produced system ) and the possibility to clearly differentiate between different production mechanisms",
    ".    events with large rapidity gaps may be selected either by using a calorimeter or by detecting leading protons with beam momentum fractions @xmath7 close to 1 . if the momenta of the leading protons can be measured with very high precision then a centrally produced state",
    "may be observed as a peak in the spectrum of the missing - mass ( @xmath8 ) distribution .",
    "indeed , it has recently been proposed @xcite to supplement cdf with very forward detectors to measure both proton and antiproton in run ii of the tevatron in events with the fractional momentum loss @xmath9 @xmath10 with extremely good accuracy , corresponding to missing - mass resolution @xmath11  mev .",
    "the experimental proposal is focused on the searches for the higgs boson , possible manifestations of the physics beyond the standard model as well as on unique studies of some subtle aspects of qcd dynamics .",
    "it is expected that , in association with the high @xmath7 protons and antiprotons , a central system with mass up to about 200  gev can be produced . to perform such challenging measurements the outgoing @xmath12 and @xmath13",
    "must be detected in roman pots , or microstations as proposed for an extension of atlas @xcite .    to ascertain whether a higgs signal can be seen ,",
    "it is crucial to evaluate the background .",
    "recall that the inclusive search for an intermediate mass higgs , that is @xmath14 or @xmath15 with @xmath16 , has an extremely small signal - to - background ratio , which makes this process impossible to observe .",
    "if we specialize to double - diffractive @xmath16 production , the background is suppressed @xcite ( see also section  3 ) .",
    "here we are going to present the estimates of the cross - sections for high energy processes of the type [ eq : a1 ] pp p + m + p , and similarly for @xmath17 , where a plus  signs indicates the presence of a large rapidity gap . to be precise",
    ", we calculate the rate for the double - diffractive exclusive production of a system of large invariant mass @xmath8 , say a higgs boson .",
    "our discussion below will be focused on the case of an intermediate mass higgs which dominantly decays into the @xmath18 final state . from the outset we would like to make it clear that today there is no consensus within the community regarding the evaluation of the double - diffractive production cross sections , see @xcite .",
    "the literature shows a wide range of predictions varying by many orders of magnitude ) can be found in @xcite . ] . as in refs .",
    "@xcite , we adopt the two - gluon exchange picture of the pomeron , where the amplitude for the double - diffractive process is shown in fig .  1 . here",
    "the hard subprocess @xmath19 is initiated by gluon - gluon fusion and an additional relatively soft @xmath5-channel gluon is needed to screen the colour flow across the rapidity gap intervals .    one major difference between the various theoretical approaches concerns the specification of the exchanged gluons .",
    "_ either _ non - perturbative gluons are used in which the propagator is modified so as to reproduce the total cross section @xcite , _ or _",
    "a perturbative qcd estimate is made @xcite using an unintegrated , skewed gluon density that is determined from the conventional gluon obtained in global parton analyses . in this respect",
    ", it has been emphasized @xcite ( see also @xcite that the non - perturbative normalisation based on the value of the elastic or total cross section fixes the diagonal gluon density at @xmath20 where the transverse momentum @xmath21 is small , namely @xmath22  gev .",
    "thus the value of @xmath23 is even smaller than [ eq : a2 ] x^ x , where the variables are defined in fig .  1 .",
    "however , the gluon density grows as @xmath24 and so the use of a non - perturbative normalisation will lead to an overestimation of double - diffractive cross sections .",
    "of course the fusion of the two energetic gluons into a high mass state , as shown in fig .  1 ,",
    "is generally accompanied by the emission of soft gluons which may populate the rapidity gaps . the basic mechanism which suppresses this effect is the additional @xmath5-channel gluon of fig .",
    "1 . it screens the colour , but does not couple to the produced state of mass @xmath8 .",
    "it has typical values of @xmath25 which are much smaller than @xmath8 , but which are large enough ( for sufficiently large @xmath8 ) to screen soft gluon emission and to justify the applicability of perturbative qcd .",
    "another crucial numerical difference between the approaches concerns the size of the so - called survival probability of rapidity gaps , @xmath6 , which symbolically can be written as [ eq : a3 ] w = s^2 t^2 .",
    "@xmath26 is the probability that the gaps are not filled by secondary particles generated by soft rescattering , see for instance @xcite .",
    "the second factor , @xmath27 , is the price to pay for not having gluon radiation in the hard subprocess @xmath19 .",
    "the estimates of the survival factor @xmath26 strongly depend on the models for soft hadron rescattering , which causes the main uncertainty in evaluation of the double - diffractive cross section . in @xcite for @xmath28",
    "gev at the lhc we tabulated our results for an optimistic estimate @xmath29 , while our detailed recent calculations @xcite yield a lower value , @xmath30 .",
    "however it has been pointed out @xcite that it is possible to check the value of @xmath26 by observing double - diffractive dijet production - fusion events with a rapidity gap on either proton side was advocated in ref .  @xcite . for this purpose",
    "it was proposed there to measure the @xmath31-production rate with the rapidity gap signature . ] .",
    "this process is driven by the same dynamics , and has a higher cross section , so a comparison of the measurements with the predictions can determine @xmath26 .",
    "the recent cdf data for diffractive dijet production , reported at this workshop @xcite , appear to be consistent with our determination of @xmath26 in ref .",
    "this is clear evidence in favour of the strong suppression due to the low survival probability of the rapidity gaps .    the @xmath32 cross section , corresponding to the basic mechanism shown in fig .  1",
    ", recently has been calculated to single @xmath33 accuracy @xcite .",
    "the amplitude is [ eq : a4 ] m = a ^3 f_g ( x_1 , x_1^ , q_t^2 , m_h^2/4 ) f_g ( x_2 , x_2^ , q_t^2 , m_h^2/4 ) , where the @xmath34 vertex factor @xmath35 is given by ( [ eq : a9 ] ) below , and the unintegrated skewed gluon densities are related to the conventional distributions by [ eq : a5 ] f_g ( x , x^ , q_t^2 , m_h^2/4 ) = r_g . the factor @xmath36 is the ratio of the skewed @xmath37 integrated gluon distribution to the conventional one @xcite .",
    "@xmath38 at lhc ( tevatron ) energies . the bremsstrahlung survival probability @xmath27 is given by [ eq : a6 ] t ( q_t , ) = ( - _ q_t^2^^2 _ 0 ^ 1 - k_t/ dz ) . note ,",
    "that the factor @xmath39 arises in ( [ eq : a5 ] ) because the survival probability is only relevant to the hard gluon exchanges in fig .  1 .",
    "the origin of the factor @xmath40 in the integrand in ( [ eq : a4 ] ) reflects the fact that the production is mediated by the fusion   of two colourless dipoles of size @xmath41 . due to the presence of this factor it is argued ( see e.g.  @xcite ) that a perturbative treatment of process ( [ eq : a1 ] ) is inappropriate .",
    "however , it is just the sudakov suppression factor @xmath42 in the integrand , which makes the integration infrared stable and hence the perturbative predictions reliable , of the gluon distribution @xmath43 additionally suppresses the contribution from the low @xmath44 domain @xcite . ] .",
    "the saddle points of the integral are located near @xmath45  gev@xmath46 at lhc ( tevatron ) energies .    the bremsstrahlung survival factor",
    "@xmath42 determines the probability _ not _ to emit the bremsstrahlung gluons in the interval @xmath47 .",
    "the upper bound of @xmath48 is clear , and the lower bound occurs because there is destructive interference of the amplitude in which the bremsstrahlung gluon is emitted from a hard  gluon with that in which it is emitted from the screening gluon .",
    "that is there is no emission when @xmath49 is larger than the separation @xmath50 of the two @xmath5-channel gluons in the transverse plane , since then they act effectively as a colour - singlet system .",
    "the neglect of such an important dampening factor in practically all theoretical papers on the double - diffractive higgs or dijet production even between these two groups .",
    "the calculation in @xcite yields a significantly lower value of @xmath27 than that advocated in @xcite . ]",
    "reminds one of the attempt to force two camels to go through the eye of a needle .",
    "the size of the eye is given by @xmath51 , while the camel s height is regulated by the position of the saddle point , @xmath52 .",
    "the amplitude ( [ eq : a4 ] ) corresponds to the exclusive process ( [ eq : a1 ] ) .",
    "the modification for the inclusive process [ eq : a7 ] pp x + m + y is given in @xcite , where it was found that the event rate is much larger . however , in the inclusive case the large multiplicity of secondaries poses an additional problem in identifying the higgs boson .",
    "in order to use the missing - mass  method to search for an intermediate mass higgs boson , via the @xmath16 decay mode , we have to estimate the qcd background which arises from the production of a pair of jets with invariant mass about @xmath53 , see ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "the good news is that the signal - to - background ratio does not depend on the uncertainty in the soft survival factor @xmath26 , and is given just by the ratio of the corresponding @xmath54 and @xmath55 subprocesses .",
    "we begin by assuming that the @xmath1 jets are not tagged .",
    "then the main background is the double - diffractive colour - singlet production of a pair of high @xmath56 gluons with rapidities @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the @xmath59 subprocess cross section is @xcite [ eq : a8 ] = ( - ) ^- , where @xmath8 is the invariant mass of the dijet system , @xmath60 is the transverse momentum of the jets , and @xmath61 is the jet rapidity difference . the background ( [ eq : a8 ] ) should be compared to the double - diffractive @xmath34 signal [ eq : a9 ] = g_f _ s^2 .",
    "first of all , in order to reduce the background we impose a jet @xmath56-cut .",
    "for instance , if we trigger on events containing a pair of jets with angles @xmath62 from the proton direction in the higgs rest frame , then we only eliminate one half of the signal , whereas the background dijet cross section is reduced to [ eq : a10 ] = 9.7 . with a common scale for the coupling @xmath63 , and neglecting the nlo corrections",
    ", we obtain a signal - to - background ratio [ eq : a11 ] = ( 4.3 10 ^ -3 ) ( h b|b ) ( ) ^3 ( ) . if @xmath28  gev , the ratio @xmath64 .",
    "this is too small for the above approach to provide a viable signal for the higgs boson .",
    "however the situation is greatly improved if we are able to identify the @xmath1 and @xmath65 jets .",
    "if we assume that there is only a 1% chance to misidentify a gluon jet as a @xmath1 jet , then tagging _ both _ the @xmath1 and @xmath65 jets will suppress the gluon background by @xmath66 . in this case",
    "only the true @xmath18 background may pose a problem .",
    "a remarkable advantage of the double - rapidity - gap signature for the @xmath16 events is that here the @xmath16 signal/@xmath18 background ratio is strongly enhanced due to the colour factors , gluon polarization selection and the spin @xmath67 nature of the quarks @xcite .",
    "first , the background @xmath18-dijet rate is suppressed due to the absence of the colour - octet @xmath18-state . thus ,",
    "for @xmath68 we have [ eq : a12 ] < < 10 ^ -2 .",
    "second , we emphasize that for the exclusive process the initial @xmath69 state obeys special selection rules . besides being a colour - singlet , for forward outgoing protons",
    "the projection of the total angular momentum is @xmath70 along the beam axis . on the other hand ,",
    "the born amplitude for light fermion pair production , with forward outgoing protons , the cancellation was first observed by pumplin @xcite , see also @xcite . ]",
    "vanishes in this @xmath70 state , see , for example , @xcite .",
    "this result follows from @xmath71- and @xmath42-invariance and fermion helicity conservation of the @xmath70 amplitude @xcite .",
    "thus , if we were to neglect the @xmath1-quark mass @xmath72 , then at leading order we would have no qcd @xmath18-dijet background at all . even beyond lo , the interference between the signal and background amplitudes is negligibly small , since they have different helicity structure .",
    "therefore the form of the peak , observed in double - diffractive exclusive @xmath16 production , will not be affected by interference with @xmath18 jets produced by the pure qcd background process .    of course , a non - vanishing @xmath18 background is predicted when we allow for the quark mass or if we emit an extra gluon .",
    "nevertheless in the former case we still have an additional suppression to ( [ eq : a12 ] ) of about a factor of @xmath73 , whereas in the latter case the extra suppression is about @xmath74 .",
    "note that events containing the third ( gluon ) jet may be experimentally separated from higgs decay , where the two jets are dominantly co - planar collisions , which was studied in detail in @xcite . ] .",
    "however , the price to pay for this separation is the further reduction of the signal caused by the sudakov suppression of the final state radiation in the higgs events @xcite .",
    "thus , the two - gluon fusion mechanism for hard production , illustrated in fig .  1 , provides a unique situation where the incoming hard two - gluon system is practically fully polarized with @xmath70 . an explicit calculation @xcite , assuming @xmath28  gev and imposing the @xmath62 cut of low @xmath56 jets , gives a signal - to - background ratio [ eq : a13 ] 4 ( ) . the signal is , thus , in excess of background even at mass resolution @xmath75  gev , so the @xmath18 background should not be a problem ratio is additionally suppressed by a factor @xmath76 . ] .",
    "while the predictions for the @xmath77-ratio look quite favourable for higgs searching using the missing - mass method , the expected event rate casts a shadow on the feasibility of this approach ( at least for experiments at the tevatron ) . the cross section for exclusive double - diffractive higgs production at tevatron and",
    "lhc energies has been calculated by several authors @xcite . in our recent analysis @xcite the gap survival probability for the double - diffractive process",
    "is estimated to be @xmath78 at @xmath79  tev and @xmath30 at @xmath80  tev . if we incorporate these estimates into the perturbative qcd calculations of @xcite , we find [ eq : a14 ] _ h & = & ( p|p p + h + |p ) 0.06  fb = 2  tev , + [ eq : a15 ] _ h & = & ( pp p + h + p ) 2.2  fb = 14  tev for a higgs boson of mass 120  gev .",
    "these values are much lower than the expectations of other authors listed in @xcite . however , as we already mentioned , the recent cdf study of diffractive dijet production @xcite , provides strong experimental evidence in favour of our pessimistic estimates of the survival factor @xmath26 , see @xcite .",
    "cdf @xcite have studied double - diffractive dijet production for jets with @xmath81  gev .",
    "they find an upper limit for the cross section , @xmath82  nb , as compared to our prediction of about 1  nb @xcite .",
    "using the dijet process as a monitor thus rules out the much larger predictions for @xmath83 which exist in the literature .",
    "unfortunately the prediction @xmath84  fb of ( [ eq : a14 ] ) means that run ii of the tevatron , with an integrated luminosity of @xmath85  fb@xmath86 , should yield less than an event .",
    "we should add that the double - diffractive higgs search can also be made in the @xmath87 and @xmath88 decay channels , but , due to the small branching ratios , the event rate is even less .",
    "we emphasize that such a low expected signal cross section at the tevatron just illustrates the high price to be paid for improving the @xmath77 ratio by selecting events with double rapidity gaps . on the other hand , a specific prediction of the perturbative approach",
    "is that the cross section @xmath89 steeply grows with energy @xcite ( c.f .",
    "( [ eq : a14 ] ) with ( [ eq : a15 ] ) ) , in contrast to non - perturbative phenomenological models based on ref .  @xcite .",
    "in fact , if we were to ignore the rapidity gap survival probability , @xmath26 , then @xmath89 would have increased by more than a factor of 100 in going from @xmath79  tev to @xmath80  tev . however , at the larger energy , the probability to produce secondaries which populate the gaps increases , and as a result the @xmath90 increases only by a factor of 40 .",
    "nevertheless , there is a real chance to observe double - diffractive higgs production at the lhc , since both the cross section and the luminosity are much larger than at the tevatron .",
    "another test of our perturbative scenario is the behaviour of the dijet cross section with the jet @xmath56 . due to the @xmath91 dependence of the perturbative gluon",
    ", we predict a steeper fall off with increasing @xmath56 than the non - perturbative models @xcite .    for the inclusive production of a higgs of mass @xmath28  gev",
    "we expect , at the lhc energy , a cross section of the order of 40(4 )  fb , taking rapidity gaps @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "the double - diffractive dijet cross sections are much larger than those for higgs production .",
    "for example , if we take a dijet bin of size @xmath93  gev for each jet and @xmath94 we obtain , for @xmath95  gev jets at lhc energies , [ eq : a16 ] .",
    "d _ excl / d|_0 40  pb , .",
    "incl / d|_0 250  pb , where @xmath96 .",
    "the rapidity gaps are taken to be @xmath97(veto ) @xmath98 for the inclusive case ( see @xcite for the definition of the kinematics ) .",
    "such a high event rate and the remarkable purity of the di - gluon system , that is generated in the exclusive double - diffractive production process , provides a unique environment to make a detailed examination of high energy gluon jets dijet events the jets appear to be pure gluon ones at the level about 3000:1 .",
    "moreover , after an appropriate selection of the two - jet configuration and the removal of the @xmath18 contamination by tagging , the sample may become ( at least ) an order of magnitude purer . ] .",
    "indeed , we may speak here of a gluon factory  @xcite .",
    "let us finally comment on the soft suppression factor @xmath26 , which causes the main uncertainty in various calculations of the rate of rapidity gap events and , thus , is the achilles heel   of the evaluation of the higgs production signal in the exclusive and inclusive processes of ( [ eq : a1 ] ) and ( [ eq : a7 ] ) respectively .",
    "this factor depends sensitively on the spatial distributions of partons inside the proton , and thus , is closely related to the whole diffractive part of the @xmath99-matrix , see ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "for example , the survival probability for central higgs production by @xmath100 fusion , with large rapidity gaps on either side , is expected to be larger than that for the double - pomeron exchange @xcite .",
    "recall that a quantitative probe of the suppression factor @xmath26 can be achieved either by measurements of central @xmath101 production @xcite or of dijet production .",
    "an instructive example is higgs boson production by the @xmath102 fusion subprocess @xcite .",
    "this process takes place at very large impact parameters , where the corresponding gap survival probabilities are @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "@xmath104 is estimated to be about 0.03  fb at @xmath79  tev and 0.3  fb at @xmath105  tev , which is comparable to our expectations ( [ eq : a14 ] ) , ( [ eq : a15 ] ) for double - diffractive higgs production .",
    "note that the strong and electromagnetic contributions have negligible interference , because they occur at quite different values of the impact parameter .",
    "as well known @xcite , the two - photon mechanism of higgs production is especially interesting for heavy ion collisions where the photon flux scales with @xmath106 ( @xmath101 being the charge of the nucleus ) @xcite . in the photon - photon case for @xmath28  gev",
    "we expect a signal - to - background ratio @xmath107 , if the experimental resolution on the reconstruction of the @xmath18-invariant mass is @xmath108  gev , and if a cut @xmath109 is imposed on the @xmath1 and @xmath65 jets .",
    "we have examined the possibility of performing a high resolution missing - mass search for the higgs boson at the tevatron , that is the process @xmath110 where a plus  denotes a large rapidity gap . using a model - independent approach",
    ", we find that there is a huge qcd background arising from double - diffractive dijet production .",
    "a central detector to trigger on large @xmath56 jets is essential .",
    "even so , the signal - to - background ratio is too small for a viable missing - mass  higgs search .",
    "the situation is much improved if we identify the @xmath1 and @xmath65 jets .",
    "the @xmath54 signal is now in excess of the qcd @xmath111 background , even for a mass resolution of @xmath75  gev .",
    "the only problem is that , when proper account is taken of the survival probability of the rapidity gaps , the @xmath110 event rate is too small at the tevatron . recall that the experimental limit on the cross section for double - diffractive dijet production confirms the small predicted rates .",
    "nevertheless , there is a real chance to observe double - diffractive higgs production at the lhc , since both the cross section and the luminosity are much larger than at the tevatron .",
    "the rather pessimistic expectations of the missing - mass higgs search at the tevatron are , however , compensated by a by - product of the double - diffractive proposal .",
    "the double - diffractive production of dijets offers a unique _ gluon factory _ , generating huge numbers of essentially pure gluon jets from a colour - singlet state in an exceptionally clean environment .",
