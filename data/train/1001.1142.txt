    "a vast variety of physical , chemical , biological and other natural processes can be adequately described by random processes exhibiting anomalous diffusion behavior at long times .",
    "this behavior , which is characterized by a nonlinear dependence of the variance of these processes on time , can be observed in various systems .",
    "anomalous diffusion actually occurs , for example , in turbulent fluids @xcite , amorphous solids @xcite , rotating flows @xcite , single molecules @xcite and porous substrates @xcite , and has been predicted to occur in many other systems @xcite .",
    "the existence of anomalous diffusion in systems with quenched , i.e. , time - independent disorder has also been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "one of the most effective and simple ways to describe anomalous diffusion in these systems is based on the motion equations for diffusing objects ( which we will call particles ) . in these equations ,",
    "the influence of quenched disorder is usually modeled by a time - independent random potential producing the corresponding random force , and the influence of thermal fluctuations is accounted for by white noise .",
    "specifically , this langevin - type approach has been successfully applied to study a variety of phenomena , including biased diffusion , which occur when particles move under a constant external force in a one - dimensional potential @xcite .",
    "if thermal fluctuations are absent then particles can be transported to an arbitrary large distance only if the distribution of the random force has bounded support . in this case",
    ", the directional transport of particles can be caused by either a periodic external force @xcite or a constant one . in the latter case , particles move only in one direction and so the completely anisotropic case of biased diffusion , when the probability of motion along and against the external force equals 1 and 0 , respectively , may exist .",
    "it has been shown for particular cases of the random force distribution that in the overdamped limit this diffusion is normal if the total force acting on a particle is strictly positive or strictly negative @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was also argued that the anomalous regimes of biased diffusion would exist if the lower ( upper ) bound of the total force at a fixed external force is equal to zero . however , none of the laws of anomalous diffusion was found in this case .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the anomalous regimes of biased diffusion of particles moving under a constant force in a randomly layered medium which acts as a piecewise constant random force .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mod ] , we describe the model , reduce it to a continuous - time random walk ( ctrw ) on a semi - infinite chain , and calculate the first two moments of the particle position .",
    "the connection between the waiting time probability density and the particle mass and the probability density of the random force is also presented in this section .",
    "the conditions providing the anomalous behavior of biased diffusion are formulated in sec .",
    "[ sec : cond ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : laws ] , using the tauberian theorem and its modified version , we derive the laws of anomalous diffusion and analyze the influence of the particle mass and the random force distribution . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] we summarize our results .",
    "we consider the one - dimensional propagation of a particle in a medium composed by the layers of a fixed width @xmath0 whose transport properties are assumed to be random .",
    "the motion of a particle in this medium occurs under the action of a constant external force @xmath1 , and the influence of the layers on the particle dynamics is modeled by a random force @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that @xmath2 ( i ) is a bounded function , i.e. , @xmath3 $ ] , ( ii ) possesses a symmetry property , i.e. , @xmath2 and @xmath4 are statistically equivalent , and ( iii ) has statistically independent values on different intervals of the length @xmath0 . in accordance with these conditions , we approximate @xmath2 by a piecewise constant random force ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] ) whose values are distributed with the same probability density @xmath5 . in this stage",
    ", we consider @xmath5 as an arbitrary symmetric probability density , @xmath6 , satisfying only the normalization condition @xmath7 .",
    "since the total force acting on a particle equals @xmath8 , where @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) is the particle position , its dynamics can be described by the motion equation @xmath11 with @xmath12 and @xmath13 being the particle mass and the damping coefficient , respectively . according to this equation , if @xmath14 then @xmath15 and particles can be transported to an arbitrary large distance in the positive direction of the axis @xmath16 .",
    "thus , in this case the condition @xmath17 holds for all sample paths of @xmath2 . on the contrary ,",

    "therefore , the average distance @xmath28 ( the angular brackets denote an average over the sample paths of @xmath2 ) from the origin to the stopping point can be written in the form @xmath29 . finally ,",
    "using the geometric series formula , we obtain the desired result @xmath30     sample path of a piecewise constant random force @xmath2 . ]    assuming that the probability that @xmath31 equals zero , i.e. , the probability density @xmath5 is not concentrated at the edges of the interval @xmath32 $ ] , one can make sure that @xmath33 and so @xmath34 as @xmath35 .",

    "it is therefore we consider here only a class of probability densities @xmath5 with bounded support .",
    "it should be noted in this context that , since infinite values of @xmath2 are physically not relevant , the assumption of bounded support is not too restrictive .",
    "our aim is to study the long - time behavior of the particle position @xmath9 at @xmath42 .",

    "we have solved this problem ( for @xmath291 ) by using the modified tauberian theorem .",
    "it should also be noted that adding to @xmath278 a weak uniform bias breaks the symmetry of the system and , as a consequence , leads to a time dependence of @xmath292 @xcite .",
    "however , the biased maps considered in @xcite do not exhibit anomalous diffusion at long times .",
    "we complete our analysis with a qualitative discussion of the role of thermal fluctuations .",
    "these fluctuations can be accounted for by adding the thermal noise term to the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq motion ] ) . in this case",
    "some important conclusions can be drawn from the asymptotic behavior of the correlator @xmath293^{2 } \\rangle$ ] as @xmath294 , where @xmath295 is the random potential that corresponds to the random force @xmath296 . since under thermal fluctuations particles",
    "can move in both directions , the random force and potential should be determined on the entire @xmath16-axis . using the properties of @xmath2 and the continuity condition for @xmath295 with @xmath297",
    ", we obtain @xmath298 here , @xmath299 , @xmath300 , and @xmath301 if @xmath302 and @xmath303 if @xmath304 . taking into account that the random forces @xmath305 with different @xmath155 are statistically independent , the definition of the correlator @xmath306 and eq .",
    "( [ u(x ) ] ) lead to the asymptotic expression @xmath307 ( @xmath308 ) , where @xmath309 .",
    "the systems with @xmath310 have long been a subject of extensive study ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a remarkable result obtained for these systems in the overdamped regime is that there always exists a threshold value @xmath311 of the external force @xmath41 in which the depinning transition occurs .",
    "this transition is characterized by vanishing the average particle velocity in the pinning state , when @xmath312 , while in the depinning state , when @xmath313 , particles move with a nonzero average velocity which strongly depends on @xmath41 . according to @xcite ,",
    "if @xmath2 is a bounded function then @xmath314 ( @xmath315 as the temperature approaches zero ) and the mean first - passage time in the depinning and pinning states is finite and infinite , respectively .",
    "since the moments of the first - passage time can be associated with the moments of the waiting time , we may expect therefore that at nonzero temperatures and @xmath18 the exponent @xmath131 and so the character of anomalous diffusion becomes depending on @xmath41 ( the diffusion behavior at @xmath14 is expected to be normal ) . specifically , with decreasing of @xmath41 from @xmath316 to @xmath311 the exponent @xmath131 should also decrease from 2 to 1 , and if @xmath317 then @xmath318 .",
    "of course , in order to find the dependence of @xmath131 on @xmath41 and the diffusion laws a quantitative consideration of the problem is needed .",
    "it is especially important because the effects arising from the joint action of quenched disorder and thermal fluctuations are often unexpected and even counterintuitive .",
    "we have studied in the long - time limit the unidirectional transport of particles which occurs under a constant force in a randomly layered medium .",
    "the influence of the layers is modeled by a piecewise constant random force whose values in different layers are assumed to be independent and identically distributed with bounded support . we have reduced the problem of the unidirectional transport , initially formulated in the framework of the motion equation , to a continuous - time random walk on a semi - infinite chain . the main statistical characteristic of this approach , the waiting time probability density ,",
    "is expressed through the probability density of the random force and particle characteristics , including the particle mass . by analyzing the dependence of the moments of the waiting time on the external force , we have formulated the conditions under which the biased diffusion exhibits the anomalous behavior .",
    "it has been shown that this behavior may occur only if the external force is equal to the boundary value of the random force .    in order to find in the anomalous regime the long - time behavior of the first and second moments of the particle position",
    ", we have used the tauberian theorem and its modified version allowing , in most cases , to determine the first two terms of the asymptotic expansion of these moments . within this approach",
    ", we have found , with one exception , the explicit asymptotic formulas for the variance of the particle position , i.e. , the laws of diffusion .",
    "the time dependence of the variance is completely controlled by the exponent describing the asymptotic behavior of the probability density of the random force in the vicinity of its minimum value .",
    "it has also been shown that , depending on the value of this exponent , the particle mass in the weakly underdamped regime can either enhance or suppress the anomalous diffusion without changing its time dependence .",
