    "in modern cosmology , our notions concerning the physics of the very early universe have introduced a new element , the inflationary period @xcite , which provides an attractive approach for solving some problems of the standard big - bang model , like the flatness , horizon , monopoles , among other .",
    "however , the essential feature of inflation is that can generate a novel mechanism to explain the large - scale structure ( lss ) of the universe @xcite and provide a causal interpretation of the origin of the anisotropies observed in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation@xcite .    by other hand , with respect to the dynamical mechanisms of inflation , the warm inflation scenario , as opposed to the standard cold inflation , has the attractive feature that it avoids the reheating period at the end of the accelerated expansion , because of the decay of the inflaton field into radiation and particles during the slow - roll phase @xcite . during the warm inflation scenario",
    "the dissipative effects are important , since radiation production occurs concurrently together with the inflationary expansion .",
    "the dissipating effects arise from a friction term which describes the process of the scalar field decaying into a thermal bath .",
    "also , during the scenario of warm inflation the thermal fluctuations arises from the inflationary epoch may play a fundamental function in producing the initial fluctuations indispensable for the large - scale structure ( lss ) formation @xcite .",
    "an indispensable condition for warm inflation scenario to occur is the presence of a radiation field with temperature @xmath1 during the inflationary expansion of the universe .",
    "since the thermal and quantum fluctuations are proportional to @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively @xcite , so when @xmath1 , the thermal fluctuations of the inflaton field predominates over the quantum fluctuations .",
    "also , inflation ends when the universe heats up to become radiation dominated , and then the universe smoothly enters to the radiation dominated era , without the need of a reheating scenario @xcite . for a review of warm inflation ,",
    "see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , cosmological implications of string / m - theory have currently attracted a great deal of attention ; specifically some were concerned with brane - antibrane configurations such as space - like branes @xcite . in this configuration , the standard model of particles",
    "is confined to the brane , while gravitation propagates into the bulk space - time . here",
    ", the effect of extra dimensions induces extra terms in the friedmann equation @xcite .",
    "in particular , the cosmological randall - sundrum ii model ( rs ii ) has received great attention in the last years@xcite .",
    "randall and sundrum suggested two similar but phenomenologically different brane world scenarios .",
    "in this form , there are two versions of the randall - sundrum model , generally mentioned as randall - sundrum i ( rs1)@xcite and randall - sundrum ii ( rs2)@xcite . somewhat confusingly , the rs1 model includes two branes , while the rs2 model only contains a single brane .    in the rs1 model , we have two 3-branes separated by a region of five - dimensional anti - de sitter spacetime . here",
    ", the fifth coordinate is compactified on @xmath4 , and the branes have equal ; positive and negative tension branes are on the two specified points . in this model of brane",
    "the matter fields are confined on the two brane and the gravity propagates in the 5-dimensional bulk . however , one important point of discussion in this brane model , is the mechanism that works to select the necessary separation distance between the two branes called radius stabilization@xcite ( see also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "similarly , the stabilization mechanism plays a crucial role in the recuperation of 4-dimensional einstein gravity@xcite .",
    "in contrast , the rs2 model@xcite contains a single , positive tension brane and a non - compact extra dimension is infinite in extent and the radius stabilization is not present in this brane model . by other hand , in the rs2 model , the observable universe is a four - dimensional time - like hypersurface .",
    "the five - dimensional energy - momentum tensor can be splited in a regular and a distributional part .",
    "the regular part describes the non - standard matter fields in five dimension and the distributional term containing the brane tension and the standard matter fields on the brane . except gravitation ,",
    "all standard model interactions and matter fields are confined to the brane .",
    "these alternatives to einstein s general relativity cosmology belongs to the so called brane - world cosmological models . for a comprehensible review of brane - world cosmology , see e.g. refs.@xcite . in the observational aspect , nowadays there is strong evidence that the very early universe could have experimented an inflationary expansion period , as was pointed out in the begging of the introduction .",
    "an important feature of the inflationary period , is that is located in a period of cosmological evolution where the effects predicted by string / m - theory are relevant .",
    "for this reason , over the last decade , there has been great interest in the construction of inflationary models inspired in these theories . in the following",
    "we will concentrate only in the rs2 model , which forms the basis for the rest of this work .",
    "as regards exact solutions , one the most interesting in the inflationary universe can be found by using an exponential potential , which is often called a power - law inflation , since the scale factor has a power - law - type evolution , here the scale factor is given by @xmath5 , in which @xmath6@xcite .",
    "also , an exact solution can be obtained in the de sitter inflationary universe , where a constant effective potential is considered ; see ref.@xcite .",
    "moreover , exact solutions can also be found for the scenario of intermediate inflation , for which the scale factor @xmath7 evolves as @xmath8 ,   \\label{at}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are two constants ; @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "it is well know that the expansion rate in this model is slower than de sitter inflation , but faster than power - law inflation ; this is why it is known as `` intermediate '' .",
    "this inflationary model was originally developed as an exact solution , however , intermediate inflation may be described from the slow - roll analysis . under the slow - roll approximation the scalar spectral index @xmath13 , and for the specific value of @xmath10 given by @xmath14",
    "the spectral index is @xmath15 ( harrizon - zeldovich spectrum ) @xcite .",
    "also , an important observational quantity in this model , is that the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath16 , which is significantly @xmath17@xcite . other motivation to consider this type of expansion for the scale factor comes from string / m - theory , which appears to be relevant in the low - energy string effective action@xcite ( see also , refs.@xcite ) .",
    "these theories can be utilized to resolve the initial singularity and describe the present acceleration in the universe , among others@xcite .",
    "also , the approach of consider the warm intermediate inflation has already been studied in the literature,@xcite in the context of other frameworks .    in this way , the goal of this paper is to analyze the possibility that a higher dimensional scenario , in particular the rs ii brane - world model , can describe the dynamics of the universe in its very early epochs .",
    "we propose this possibility in the context of warm inflation scenario for a universe evolving according to the intermediate scale factor , and how a generalized form of dissipative coefficient @xmath18 influences the dynamics of our model . in order to study our brane - warm intermediate model",
    "we will consider the full effective friedmann equation , and not the lower energy limit or the high energy limit for the effective friedmann equation .",
    "also , we will study the cosmological perturbations , which are written in terms of several parameters . here ,",
    "the parameters are constrained from the bicep2 data@xcite together with the planck satellite@xcite and planck 2015@xcite . by other hand",
    ", it is well known that the bicep2 experiment data has important theoretical significance on the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves produced during inflation . in this form",
    ", the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath16 from the bicep2 data , has been found at more than 5@xmath19 confidence level ( c.l . ) in which the ratio @xmath20 at 68@xmath21 c.l . , and with foreground subtracted @xmath22@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this value of the tensor - to - scalar ratio has become less transparent , see e.g. ref.@xcite . of this way , a detailed analysis from planck and bicep2 data would be necessary for a definitive answer to the diffuse galactic dust contamination .",
    "recently , the planck collaboration published new data of enhanced precision of the cmb anisotropies@xcite . here , the planck full mission data improved the upper bound on the tensor to scalar ratio @xmath23 , and this upper bound for the ratio @xmath16 is similar to obtained from refs.@xcite , in which @xmath24 .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : the next section presents a short review of the effective friedmann equation for the randall - sundrum type ii scenario . in the section iii",
    "we study the dynamics of warm inflation in this brane - world model , in the weak and strong dissipative regimes ; specifically , we obtain explicit expressions for the inflaton scalar field , dissipative coefficient , and effective scalar potential .",
    "immediately , we compute the cosmological perturbations in both dissipative regimes , obtaining expressions for observational quantities such as the scalar power spectrum , scalar spectral index , and the tensor - to - scalar ratio . at the end , section iv summarizes our results and exhibits our conclusions .",
    "we chose units so that @xmath25 .",
    "followings , refs.@xcite we consider a five - dimensional scenario , for which the modified friedmann equation for a spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric , has the form    @xmath26+\\frac{\\lambda_4}{3}+\\frac{\\xi}{a^4 } , \\label{eq1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath27 represents the hubble parameter , @xmath28 denotes the scale factor , the constant @xmath29 , and the energy density @xmath30 corresponds to the energy density of the matter content confined to the brane , @xmath31 is the effective four - dimensional cosmological constant on the brane , and @xmath32 denotes the influence of the bulk gravitons on the brane , where @xmath33 is an integration constant .",
    "the term @xmath34 represents the brane tension and , considering the nucleosynthesis epoch , the value of the brane tension is constrained to be @xmath35 ( 1mev)@xmath36 @xcite .",
    "however , a stronger limit for the value of the brane tension results from usual tests for deviation from newtons law , for which @xmath37(10 tev)@xmath36 , see ref.@xcite .    in the following , we will consider that the cosmological constant @xmath38 , and once inflation begins , the term @xmath32 rapidly becomes unimportant . in this form , the effective friedmann equation given by eq.([eq1 ] )",
    "becomes @xmath39 .",
