    "multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) broadcast channels ( bc ) have received significant attention in recent years .",
    "one reason is that , provided that channel state information is available at the transmitter ( csit ) , the sum rate of the system ( also called throughput ) scales linearly with the minimum of the number of transmit antennas and the aggregate number of receive antennas @xcite .",
    "thus , given enough receivers , the throughput can be increased simply by increasing the number of transmit antennas , even if each receiver has only a single antenna @xcite .",
    "while the capacity region of the gaussian mimo bc is well known , it has only been achieved so far using the so - called dirty - paper coding ( dpc ) technique @xcite .",
    "however , dpc is widely regarded as being mostly of theoretical value , due to its significantly high implementation complexity @xcite . as a consequence , suboptimal ,",
    "lower - complexity schemes have been intensively investigated , with the goal of enabling a practical implementation that achieves good performance .",
    "the simplest and yet very rich class of alternative methods is that of linear precoding ( or beamforming ) , which consists of multiplying the ( complex - valued ) signals to be transmitted by a well - chosen matrix @xcite , aiming at producing parallel channels to each receiver , while balancing residual interference and noise .",
    "popular methods in this class include zero - forcing ( zf ) precoding and regularized zero - forcing ( rzf ) precoding .",
    "while these methods are simple and achieve the same multiplexing gain as dpc , they suffer a significant penalty when the aggregate number of receive antennas is equal or slightly less than the number of transmit antennas , even for asymptotically high snr @xcite .",
    "however , even _ optimal _ linear precoding @xcite ( which is currently infeasible to implement in practice ) falls short of achieving the dpc performance .",
    "recently , an integer - forcing ( if ) approach to the problem has been proposed that appears to provide promising gains without a significant increase in complexity @xcite .",
    "the approach is inspired by the compute - and - forward ( cf ) framework for the multiple - access channel ( mac ) @xcite and can be understood as the dual of the integer - forcing approach for the mimo mac @xcite .",
    "fundamentally , it is a nonlinear technique that nevertheless enjoys many of the properties of traditional linear schemes .    from a high level",
    ", the if approach to precoding can be described as a concatenation of three layers . in the inner layer ( closest to the channel ) , the transmitter applies linear beamforming so that the precoded channel matrix becomes approximately an integer matrix @xmath0 ; this is referred to as precoding at the signal level , or _",
    "signal precoding_. in the outer layer , the transmitter precodes the original messages into auxiliary messages , pre - inverting the integer channel matrix @xmath0 that will be seen by the receivers .",
    "this is referred to precoding at the message level , or _ message precoding _ , and is entirely performed using finite - field operations . in the middle layer , the transmitter channel encodes the auxiliary messages using nested lattice codes , forming the codewords to which signal precoding is applied .",
    "each receiver then attempts to decode an integer linear combination of these codewords , where the coefficients of the linear combination correspond to the rows of the integer matrix @xmath0 . due to the message precoding , each correctly decoded message is exactly the original message intended to that receiver .",
    "moreover , assuming that lattice encoding and decoding can be done efficiently , the overall complexity is only slightly higher than that of classical linear precoding , essentially due to the message precoding stage .    originally ,",
    "an integer - forcing scheme without beamforming was proposed in @xcite , where it was named reverse compute - and - forward ( rcf ) .",
    "a more general version allowing beamforming was also proposed in @xcite ; however , a specific choice of the beamforming matrix was used , which enforced the precoded channel matrix to be exactly integer . the most general form of if , allowing arbitrary linear beamforming , as well as potentially different shaping lattices for each user , was later proposed in @xcite in the context of an uplink - downlink duality result for if . however",
    ", a disadvantage of such a high degree of generality is that finding an optimal choice of beamforming and integer matrices is a very hard and currently still an open problem @xcite .      in this work ,",
    "we restrict our attention to the special case of if with a single shaping lattice for all users and focus on the optimization of the signal precoding and integer matrices .",
    "we propose a specific structure for the precoding matrix called _ diagonally - scaled exact integer - forcing _",
    "this scheme is a generalization of the exact if scheme in [ 12 ] by allowing arbitrary scaling by a diagonal matrix , akin to the power scaling in conventional beamforming .",
    "as we shall see , such a _ moderate _ degree of generalization is key to obtaining a scheme that is flexible yet amenable to optimization .",
    "we analyze the performance of dif for high snr and show that it achieves maximum spatial multiplexing gain . for the specific case of two receivers and high snr",
    ", we derive the optimal solution for both the precoding matrix and the integer matrix . in a surprising",
    "contrast to if for the mac case  which typically requires solving a lattice basis reduction problem in order to find an optimal integer matrix  we show that both matrices can be found analytically and therefore very efficiently .",
    "this result in turn provides an expression for the achievable sum rate of dif in almost closed form .",
    "in particular , we show that the gap between the sum rate achievable by dif and that of dpc is upper bounded by 0.27 bits for any channel matrix . for general snr , we propose a regularized version of dif ( rdif ) and show numerically that the method achieves a sum - rate performance very close to dpc .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . the gaussian mimo bc model and the necessary background on if are reviewed in section [ sec : prelim ] , along with the problem statement .",
    "in section  [ sec : exact - if ] , we describe our proposed scheme and analyze its performance in the high snr regime . in section",
    "[ sec : two - user ] , we focus on the two receiver case and derive the optimal selection of the precoding and integer matrices in high snr regime .",

    "section  [ sec : general snr ] extends the scheme for the general snr case .",

    "when @xmath139 and @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is chosen to satisfy a per - antenna power - constraint , then the scheme reduces to rcf with `` integer - forcing beamforming '' proposed in @xcite , which produces an exactly integer effective channel matrix . in this case",
    "it is no longer possible to optimize each @xmath141 individually , since @xmath131 ( and thus @xmath110 ) depends on @xmath0 .",

    "it is also worth mentioning that if we take @xmath144 , then becomes equivalent to optimal linear precoding @xcite ( with the sum rate as objective ) .",

    "thus , rdif reduces to dif in the high snr scenario .      we can give a more formal justification for rdif based on the uplink - downlink duality for integer forcing proved in @xcite .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that any rate tuple achievable in the downlink with a certain power vector can also be achieved in the uplink with a certain ( possibly different ) power vector , and the same result holds with the roles of downlink and uplink reversed .",
    "each power coefficient refers to the second moment of the shaping lattice for the corresponding user ( in the case where multiple shaping lattices are allowed ) .",
    "in addition , the uplink and downlink channels are subject to the same total power constraint and are related by a transpose ( or hermitian , in the complex case ) of all corresponding matrices , similarly to the general uplink - downlink duality for the mac and the bc .    by starting with the downlink problem with a rate tuple that achieves a certain sum rate @xmath64",

    "with all other parameters fixed , the optimal beamforming matrix can be obtained in closed form , which can only possibly improve the sum rate .",

    "first , in our problem only a single shaping lattice is allowed , which corresponds to the choice @xmath346 .",
    "second , we choose @xmath347 , which gives @xmath348 .",
    "note that the latter choice is analogous to the heuristic derivation of rzf as a suboptimal solution to the problem of optimal linear precoding @xcite .",
    "it is important to emphasize that , even with these simplifications , the optimization problem for if is still seemingly hard , due to the appearance of @xmath0 in , making it difficult to optimize @xmath174 as well as @xmath0 .",
