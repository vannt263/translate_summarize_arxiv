    "the idea that we could live on a brane embedded in a higher - dimensional space dates back to  refs .",
    "@xcite where it was proposed that the universe be modeled as a topological defect ( a domain wall or a string ) in a higher - dimensional space - time .",
    "the key feature of these models is the localization of matter on the brane , which makes the theory look four - dimensional at low energies . in the setup of ref .",
    "@xcite this was achieved by means of yukawa interaction between the domain wall and the fermion field .",
    "the latter has a zero mode localized on the brane , as well as the continuum modes separated from the zero mode by a gap . at low energies ,",
    "only the zero mode remains in the spectrum and plays the role of a four - dimensional particle .",
    "it was suggested later  @xcite that the gravitational attraction may also trap particles on the brane .",
    "this idea has been the subject of renewed interest since it has been shown  @xcite that the graviton itself can be trapped on the brane by the gravitational force , leading to effectively four - dimensional gravity .",
    "considering a brane embedded in a 5d anti - de sitter ( ads@xmath4 ) space - time , the authors of  ref .",
    "@xcite have found that in this `` warped '' geometry the 5d graviton has a zero - energy bound state , which , being localized on the brane , can be interpreted as the ordinary 4d graviton . even though there is no gap separating the zero mode of graviton from the continuum ,",
    "the law of gravity on the brane is essentially newtonian , the corrections yielded by light continuum modes modifying this behavior only at very short distances .",
    "soon after , a model was proposed  @xcite in which 4d newton s law is reproduced only at intermediate scales and gets modified at very large scales .",
    "the geometry considered consisted of a flat 5d space glued onto a portion of  ads@xmath4 space .",
    "it has been shown that , even though there is no localized graviton , newton s gravity can still be recovered on the brane at intermediate scales . at short distances , the gravitational potential receives corrections similar to those encountered in the model of  ref .",
    "@xcite . at very large scales ,",
    "the extra dimensions `` open up '' and the gravitational potential receives `` five - dimensional '' contributions from the tensor modes , that is contributions scaling as  @xmath5 , @xmath6 being the distance between sources .",
    "this behavior was related  @xcite to the presence of a resonant mode  a `` quasi - bound state ''  at zero energy , with lifetime proportional to the long - distance scale of the model ( see also  ref .",
    "@xcite itself ) .",
    "subsequent works  @xcite made manifest the importance of the scalar sector ( and namely the radion mode ) in the description of the effective gravity on the brane in models with metastable gravitons . indeed , being constructed from the massive modes , the propagator of the effective 4d graviton is likely to have an incorrect tensor structure , leading to predictions inconsistent with the observations  @xcite .",
    "coupling to the trace of the energy - momentum tensor , radion contributes to the graviton propagator and thus makes it possible to recover einstein gravity at the intermediate distances  @xcite .",
    "model presented in  @xcite has however a serious drawback : it requires the use of the negative tension branes  or , in other words , violation of the condition of positivity of energy  @xcite .",
    "it was shown  @xcite that this forces radion to become a ghost  @xcite and causes the effective gravity at very large distances to become scalar anti - gravity  @xcite .",
    "while this behavior occurs at the experimentally inaccessible scales , presence of negative norm states certainly raises doubts concerning the consistency of the model .",
    "an alternative brane model producing an infrared modification of gravity was constructed in  @xcite using a thin brane embedded in five - dimensional minkowski space .",
    "the action included a four - dimensional einstein term on the brane , induced by radiative corrections due to the matter fields localized there .",
    "this term was shown to dominate the gravitational interactions of the brane matter at intermediate scales , giving four - dimensional gravity at intermediate scales , while at large scales it became five - dimensional .",
    "this setup was subsequently extended to higher dimensions  @xcite and its generalizations to smooth branes were also considered  @xcite .",
    "recently , the idea of induced gravity was applied to the warped space - times @xcite .",
    "as yet , the setups with induced gravity are not entirely satisfactory : most of the models suffer from ghosts and/or strong gravity problems  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the idea of infrared modification of gravity remains very appealing as it is thought  @xcite that it could be a solution to the cosmological constant problem .",
    "the feature shared by these models is that at ultra - large scales gravity becomes higher - dimensional , that is the gravitational potential scales as @xmath7 , @xmath6 being the distance between sources and @xmath8 the number of extra dimensions ( at least as far as the tensor sector is concerned ) .",
    "it is natural to wonder whether this feature is inherent to the quasilocalized gravity on branes embedded in higher dimension space - times or if it could exhibit some different , more general , behaviors .",
    "more generally , one may ask what kinds of large - distance modifications of gravity are in principle possible in this setup and under what conditions they can be realized .    in order to cast some light on this issue",
    ", we study in this paper tensor perturbations of the metric around a fairly generic five - dimensional warped background , in which the graviton is not fully localized on the brane ( becoming a metastable state ) . to some extent ,",
    "our model can be considered as a toy model of quasilocalized gravity .",
    "of course , as shows the example of  @xcite , studying only the tensor sector of metric perturbations is unlikely to give a full description of effective gravity on branes and we do not aspire to present a realistic solution for quasilocalization of gravity .",
    "the aim of this work is rather to signal a peculiar behavior of the potential yielded by the tensor perturbations in such kinds of backgrounds . for the sake of simplicity , throughout the paper we will loosely refer to the contribution of the tensor modes to the gravitational potential as to the potential itself , bearing in mind that in any concrete model one should account for the contribution from the scalar sector as well .",
    "same applies to our description of gravitational waves .",
    "we find that our model gives 4d gravitational potential at intermediate scales  quite similarly to the situation encountered in the model of  ref .",
    "this `` quasilocalization '' of gravity is a generic feature of the geometry which we consider  whether or not the embedding space - time is asymptotically flat . at large distances ,",
    "we observe a novel behavior : the potential gets modified and is of type  @xmath1 , @xmath2 being a function of the parameters of the model .",
    "it becomes  5d ( @xmath3 ) only when the geometry is asymptotically flat .",
    "thus , the gravitational potential does not necessarily exhibit  5d behavior at very large distances .",
    "although throughout this paper we use the example and the language of gravity , our analysis is in fact quite universal , in that it is not constrained to the gravity sector , but can apply to the matter sector as well .",
    "indeed , our considerations are based on studying the properties of a shrdinger - like equation governing the behavior of the metric perturbations and , by consequence , the effective physics on the brane . actually , irrespective of the spin of the matter fields present in the bulk",
    ", the mass spectrum of the effective four - dimensional theory is determined by a schrdinger - like equation of some type ( or a system of thereof ) .",
    "using this fact , several authors have studied the localization of different matter fields in the ads@xmath4 background of ref .",
    "@xcite and its variations : it was shown that , similarly to gravitons , the spectrum of massless bulk scalars  @xcite consists of a localized zero mode , followed by the continuum of arbitrarily light states .",
    "massless fermions  @xcite can also be localized on the brane and mechanisms to localize gauge fields were proposed @xcite .",
    "localization of massive scalars and fermions was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , where it was shown that while there are no truly localized states ( massive or massless ) , the setup allows for metastable massive particles on the brane , having a small , but finite , probability of tunneling into the bulk . in the scalar case ,",
    "these resonant states were shown to give @xmath0 contribution to the effective static potential on the brane , while the light states of the continuum give a power - law behavior at large distances .",
    "our analysis completes the picture , revealing that , under certain conditions , in the absence of true bound states and massive resonances , it is possible to have an `` almost localized '' massless state , inducing a @xmath0 potential on the brane evolving towards a ( fractional ) power - law behavior at large distances .",
    "let us begin with the general setup .",
    "we consider 5d `` warped '' space - times preserving  4d poincar symmetry : @xmath9 where the `` warp factor ''  @xmath10 in an even and non - decreasing function of  @xmath11 .",
    "we suppose that the ordinary matter is localized on the brane centered at @xmath12 . in order to study the nature of the gravitational interactions experienced by this matter",
    ", we need to study perturbations around the background metric .",
    "we will consider exclusively the tensor perturbation  @xmath13 , @xmath14 and  @xmath15 being the four - dimensional tensor indices and  @xmath16 metric determinant .",
    "the behavior of this perturbation is governed by the schrdinger - like equation @xmath17 where  @xmath18 and the potential is given in terms of the warp factor : @xmath19 which is a form familiar from the supersymmetric quantum mechanics with the `` superpotential '' @xmath20 the factorization of the hamiltonian : @xmath21 ensures that the zero - energy mode @xmath22\\ ] ] is the ground state of the system .    in this way ,",
    "studying the influence of the tensor modes on the effective gravity on the brane is reduced to studying the properties of the spectrum of the one - dimensional quantum mechanical system  @xmath23 .",
    "the quantity of particular interest is the spectral density  @xmath24 , as it enters the retarded green s function  @xmath25 which determines the gravitational interactions on the brane and consequently the observable physical quantities , such as the induced gravitational potential and radiation of gravitational waves .",

    "the purpose of this work is not to present any particular realistic setup for the quasilocalized gravity , but rather to study general properties of warped space - times in which this phenomenon can arise and determine what are the possible large distance behaviors of the gravitational potential ( induced by the tensor modes ) . with this aim in mind ,",

    "our choice of superpotential corresponds in general to geometries which are not asymptotically flat  except when the limit   is considered . to ensure that the resulting potential does not have singularities stronger than finite jumps we demand that  @xmath30 be continuous .",

    "the results of the next section will demonstrate that this type of singularity can also strongly influence the physics .",
    "let us now turn to the contribution of the tensor modes to the effective gravity on the brane .",
    "the static potential between two sources on the brane , separated by the distance  @xmath96 receives yukawa - type contributions from all the modes and is given by : @xmath97 it is convenient to divide the integral into two parts : @xmath98 for distances  @xmath99 the second integral is negligible and in the first one we can replace  @xmath61 by its approximate form  @xmath78 , which gives us : @xmath100 this integral is always saturated for  @xmath81 , that is for @xmath101 .",
    "we can therefore extend the integration to infinity and evaluate the resulting integral in two regimes : @xmath102 and @xmath103 . in the first regime , that is for distances @xmath104 , the exponential in  @xmath105 can be set to 1 and we obtain : @xmath106 where @xmath107 is defined by  @xmath108 .",
    "therefore , in this ( large ) interval of distances , light modes of the continuum spectrum reproduce precisely the same  @xmath0 potential we would get in the presence of a massless boson ( or , in other words , a normalizable zero mode ) .    in the second regime , that is for large distances , @xmath103 , only @xmath109 will give significant contributions to the integral .",
    "we can therefore neglect @xmath75 and @xmath110 terms in the denominator of the integrand in  @xmath105 , thus obtaining : @xmath111 hence , we have a modification of the  @xmath0 law for large distances , with the potential of type  @xmath112,where  @xmath113 .",
    "thus , the gravity does not in general become five - dimensional , except in an asymptotically flat geometry ( @xmath50 ) , where the potential is : @xmath114    following  @xcite , we can also study the propagation of gravitational waves generated by a periodic point - like source on the brane , @xmath115 ( we omit the four - dimensional indices ) .",
    "the field induced on the brane is given by the convolution of the source with the green s function  @xmath116 @xmath117 which after inserting  @xmath116 and simplifying becomes @xmath118 where again @xmath96 and  @xmath119 when  @xmath120 and  @xmath121 when  @xmath122 . only modes with  @xmath120 are actually radiated ; the other ones exponentially fall off from the source .",
    "being interested in the propagation of waves , we can integrate in  @xmath123 only up to  @xmath124 .",
    "considering the range of frequencies @xmath125 allows us to replace  @xmath61 by  @xmath78 and approximate  @xmath126 by  @xmath127 : @xmath128 where we have extended the integration to infinity , using the fact that the integral is saturated for  @xmath129 .",
    "for distances @xmath130 the phase factor in  @xmath131 varies very slowly and can be set to 1 .",
    "we then obtain the usual  @xmath0 dependence of wave amplitude on the distance to the source : @xmath132 for distances @xmath130 we can neglect @xmath75 and @xmath110 terms in the denominator of the integrand in  @xmath131 , obtaining @xmath133 that is , the amplitude is proportional to  @xmath134 , where  @xmath135 .",
