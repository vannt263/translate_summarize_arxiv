    "low - dimensional magnetic systems , in particular copper oxides , are interesting subjects of study due to the novel physics that can emerge when they are cooled to low temperatures .",
    "magnetism in these materials arises from the spin-1/2 moments carried by the cu@xmath0 sites , and the magnetic couplings can vary strongly in magnitude and sign depending on the geometry and environment of the copper oxide bonds involved .",

    "a natural mineral , azurite can be considered one of the first experimental realizations of the 1d distorted diamond chain model .",
    "while it orders antiferromagnetically below 1.9k@xcite there has been much debate involving the relative exchange interactions between the cu ions as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : exchange ] . much experimental analysis and theoretical modeling have been performed however there is as yet no general consensus as to the exact magnitudes of the exchange interactions either within the 1d diamond chain , or between chains@xcite . despite this",
    ", there is significant evidence that suggests the exchange interaction j@xmath3 is by far the strongest interaction leading to a coupling of cu - ions into dimers and monomers @xcite . from these results",
    "it is now widely believed that azurite can not be described in terms of a simple isotropic exchange chain hamiltonian , but rather that inter - chain coupling and/or anisotropic exchange must also be taken into account when describing this material .",
    "recently detailed investigations of the low temperature nuclear and magnetic structures has been performed@xcite . from these studies",
    "it was found that the symmetry of azurite was @xmath4 rather than the previously determined @xmath5 .",

    "one can now speculate how the relative magnetic moment orientation of the dimer and monomer spins can affect the local magnetic environment in the ordered phase .",
    "for instance , it was proposed that the non - negligible moment on the dimer sites originates from the effective staggered field from the antiferromagnetically coupled monomers.@xcite .    in this paper , we present inelastic neutron scattering data of the quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) , s = 1/2 antiferromagnet ( afm ) cu@xmath1(co@xmath1)@xmath2(oh)@xmath2 .",

    "inelastic neutron scattering measurements were conducted at the helmholtz zentrum berlin ( hzb ) , using flex , the cold - neutron triple - axis spectrometer .",

    "the sample was mounted onto the end of a kelvinox dilution insert and placed within the 7.5 t vertical field magnet .",
    "the temperature of the sample was varied between 0.05 - 20 k but was stable for each measurement to within @xmath20 k. the sample alignment was checked in diffraction mode , using the backscattering detector banks confirming an @xmath21 - @xmath19 scattering plane .",
    "data were taken using the chopper package @xmath22 which covered an energy transfer range of @xmath23 e @xmath24 mev with a resolution at e = 0 of 0.025 mev .",

    "since recent theoretical work has implied significant interchain contributions to the interactions in azurite , it was important to measure the dispersion relation along each of the three directions .",

    "the dynamics within the * * hk**0 plane were measured on the single crystal sample by summing together data from 20 different sample rotation positions covering 90@xmath26 .",
    "these results reveal the rich nature of the low energy magnetic scattering excitations in azurite .",
    "it is believed that this scattering results from an effective 1d chain primarily of monomer spins , while the dimerised pairs of cu - ions primarily contribute to scattering at higher energies.@xcite in this way multiple brillouin zones could be mapped out showing the dispersive relation along the chain direction , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wow ] .",
    "these data have been treated for detector efficiency with a background subtracted and the intensity modulation across the brillouin zone is a result of the cu - form factor . for these measurements , the sample temperature remained constant at 60 mk in order to reduce the influence of thermal fluctuations on the excitations . while the overall dispersion looks very similar to",
    "that observed on flex and in earlier measurements@xcite , there are clearly additional features which are revealed from the higher resolution study . in particular , there is evidence now of 2 gaps at the afm brillouin zone center ( 0 , -0.5 , 0 ) located at @xmath27 mev and @xmath28 mev . while the periodic dispersion resembles the scattering from a 1d heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain ( hafc ) with a spinon continuum , this model is gapless as demonstrated in the simulation of fig .",
    "heisenberg interchain interactions would allow for the observed gaps in the @xmath15-dispersion however these would also be responsible for dispersive behaviour along the other principal directions , @xmath14 and @xmath16 . since fig .",

    "it is clear from the current high - resolution results that the simple 1d heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain model is insufficient to fully describe azurite .",

    "[ fig : btl ] , by introducing anisotropy into the system , an energy gap opens up in the excitation spectra .",

    ", the excitations in the pure xyz chain are gapped spinons which form an empty particle and filled hole band @xcite .",
    "neutrons measure continua of pairs of these excitations just as in the isotropic case .",
    "although the spherical rotational symmetry is completely broken there is only one type of spinon which is now gapped . within a mean field theory",

    "the transverse continuum of scattering is given by pair - states of momenta @xmath59 and @xmath60 at @xmath61 and energy @xmath62 . whereas the longitudinal continuum moment is @xmath63 with the same energy relation @xmath62 .",
    "the energy gap for zero field is the same for the longitudinal and transverse continuum so does not explain the different gaps in the continua that we actually observed .",
    "while anisotropy is likely to be responsible for opening one energy gap in the ground state excitation spectrum , interchain coupling can be used to describe the multiple gaps observed .",
    "the effects of interchain coupling in azurite have previously been down played due to the minimal dispersion observed in the earlier inelastic neutron scattering results@xcite , however more recently the importance of interchain coupling has been highlighted as necessary to fully describe the interactions between cu - ions.@xcite in fact , some form of anisotropic interchain coupling may also account for the slight dispersion between the chains , observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : flex ] . for kcuf@xmath1 , a model hafc with weak interchain coupling ,",
    "the quantum field theory works almost perfectly and is accurate to a few percent . in contrast , for azurite the agreement with the quantum field theory for coupled heisenberg chains is only within  30% .",
    "this means that an anisotropic interchain coupling ( ising like ) is a credible possibility and interchain couplings should be considered to have a similar influence to within - chain anisotropy .",
    "interchain coupling theories which have been developed for the heisenberg case , may also be applied for the case of heisenberg chains coupled through an ising interchain interaction .",
    "these theories can give a reasonable approximation of interchain coupling involved in azurite .",
    "the formula can be adapted to explain the nel ordering temperature @xmath64 k , ordered moment @xmath65 and gap energy @xmath66 mev and can all be related to the interchain coupling @xmath67 by using quantum field theory .",
    "for instance , we can estimate the interchain coupling by considering the relationship between the energy gap and the ordered monomer moment as outlined in essler et al .",
    "a combination of equations 15 and 56 from this paper gives the simple relation @xmath68)^2 = 0.048 $ ] mev .",
    "similarly , taking the approach of schulz@xcite , the interchain interaction can be approximated as 0.065 mev for a gap @xmath69 mev .",
    "if we consider the critical temperature , @xmath64 k , to influence the strength of the interchain coupling , we find that for a cubic lattice the interchain coupling would be @xmath70 mev as outlined in the work of bocquet@xcite .",
    "a more sophisticated analysis by irkhin and katanin@xcite gives a slightly improved estimate of the interchain coupling as @xmath71 mev with the following formula @xmath72 .",
    "the effect of three dimensional ordering of an array of spin chains is to induce an effective staggered field on the chains .",
    "in azurite , the spinons in the continuum are bound into well defined modes by the interchain coupling . within this spinon picture for the heisenberg chain ,",
    "the staggered field produces two modes , one with gap @xmath29 which is a doublet which has a polarization perpendicular ( transverse ) to the staggered field ( ordering direction ) .",
    "a breather mode ( consisting of 2 bound solitons , or 4 bound spinons ) also forms with a gap @xmath30 which has a polarization along the staggered field direction ( longitudinal ) . in the special case of pure heisenberg interaction",
    "the gap ratio @xmath29:@xmath30 is 1:@xmath73 . in general",
    "this ratio will vary with anisotropy for an xyz hamiltonian . for the case where the applied field and staggered field directions coincide then the lower mode with gap @xmath29 which has a transverse polarization will remain commensurate as is observed , whilst the upper mode with @xmath30 will split in @xmath74 with field as also observed .    in the current experiments the applied field was along the @xmath31-axis when the magnetic ordering was observed for the monomers to be in the @xmath75 plane at an angle of @xmath76 from @xmath31@xcite .",
    "the spin fluctuations along the @xmath77-axis then are both transverse to the field and to the magnetic order .",
    "they then should not split in @xmath78 and will have a lower gap energy that changes only weakly with field .",
    "neutron measurements are sensitive to the fluctuations perpendicular to @xmath74 and since the chain direction ( @xmath77 ) was aligned almost completely perpendicular to the wavevector transfer , the @xmath77-axis mode ( transverse ) is more strongly probed rather than the @xmath79 correlation .",
    "the correlations for the @xmath31 component ( longitudinal ) will always appear strongly because they are vertical and therefore always perpendicular to @xmath78 transfer .",
    "these will pick up the incommensuration from the longitudinal nature of the field in relation to the ordering and so we expect incommensuration of the upper mode as is seen .    in the spin chain material cdc , which is a fundamentally heisenberg system with very small interchain coupling @xcite , similar behaviour to azurite",
    "is seen . in particular solitons and breathers",
    "are observed as well as the incommensurate behaviour of these modes .",
    "however the situation is not identical to azurite which is probably an xyz chain with larger interchain coupling . also , in cdc the staggered field is due to the applied field combining with the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction whereas for azurite the staggered field is probably from an interchain coupling effect .    finally , the most powerful method to determine the exchanges in a quantum magnet is to use the method of saturation ( which was developed to understand cs@xmath2cucl@xmath80 in @xcite ) .",
    "so far only the exchange couplings along the chain direction in azurite have been observed by applying fields above 11 tesla@xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the energy gap at the zone center does not close at the onset of the plateau phase ( @xmath81 t ) .",
    "this is a signature of anisotropy and/or interchain coupling .",
    "the scale of this gap at 11 t was around 0.142 mev giving an interchain coupling of @xmath82 mev which agrees well with the values deduced above .",
    "in addition the scattering at the zone center , @xmath83 , when linearly extrapolated as a function of field ( as seen in fig . 4 from @xcite ) also does not close at 0 t. a possible explanation for this involves interchain coupling from the ( 1,0,0 ) that is ferromagnetic along 110 , 100 , and 1 - 10 directions .",
    "this requires more detailed analysis but may indicate the presence of frustrated interchain interactions . to understand this saturation phase better ,",
    "the dispersions along the @xmath79 and @xmath31 directions should be measured such that the couplings within the plateau phase can be extracted .",
    "in summary , high resolution inelastic neutron scattering results have shown that azurite is not well described by the 1d hafc model . instead , more complex interaction pathways are a necessary addition to the spin - chain hamiltonian to describe the observed features .",
    "anisotropic interchain interactions of around 10% of the intrachain interactions are required to explain the two gapped modes in the dispersion along the chain direction .",
    "the 3d long range magnetic ordered state can also be attributed to the presence of these interchain interactions .",

    "<S> azurite , a natural mineral made up of cuo chains , is also an intriguing spin-1/2 quantum magnet . </S>",
    "<S> there has been much debate as to the 1-dimensional ( 1d ) nature of this material by theorists and experimentalists alike . </S>",
    "<S> the focus of this debate lies in the interactions between cu - ions within the antiferromagnetically ordered state below 1.9 k. we present high - resolution inelastic neutron scattering data which highlight the complexity of the magnetic ground state of azurite . </S>",
    "<S> the application of magnetic fields and temperatures were used to probe the excitations revealing important information about the dynamics in this system . from this </S>",
    "<S> we are able to conclude that the 1d heisenberg antiferromagnetic spin chain model is not sufficient to describe the dynamics in azurite . </S>",
    "<S> instead additional coupling including interchain interactions and an anisotropic staggered field are necessary to fully model the observed excitations . </S>"
