    "in this note we are interested in performing a second order analysis for a non - local isoperimetric problem arising as a variational limit of the ohta - kawasaki functional introduced for a density functional theory for microphase separation of a / b diblock copolymers .    among the several mean field approximation theories proposed to model the phase separation in diblock copolymer melts , the one derived by ohta and kawasaki in @xcite turns out to be one of the most promising from the mathematical point of view",
    "let @xmath1 be a bounded domain representing the volume occupied by the polymeric material .",
    "the free energy can be written as a non - local functional of cahn - hilliard type as @xmath2 where @xmath3 represents the density distribution of the monomers forming the copolymers , @xmath4 is the green s function of the laplace operator with neumann boundary conditions and @xmath5 is the difference of the phases volume fractions .",
    "the formulation was first introduced in @xcite and for a derivation of the ohta - kawasaki density function theory from the self - consistent mean field theory we refer the reader to @xcite and the references therein .    as pointed out in @xcite , depending on the molecular structure of the polymers",
    "there are several regimes of phase mixture .",
    "nevertheless the presence of an observable phase separation occurs in the so called intermediate or strong segregation regimes , wherein the domain size is much larger than the interfacial length .",
    "this suggests that most of the features of the model can be described , from a mathematical point of view , by looking at the sharp interface limit of @xmath6 as the thickness @xmath7 of the diffuse interface tends to zero .",
    "thus we are lead to study the minimizers of the following energy functional , that arises as the @xmath8-limit of @xmath6 in the @xmath0 topology , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a function of bounded variation and @xmath11 denotes its total variation in @xmath12 .",
    "the functional can be described in a more geometric way that turns out to be suitable for our analysis . indeed , identifying the function @xmath13 with the set @xmath14 and using the properties of @xmath15 , we can rewrite @xmath16 , up to a multiplicative constant , as @xmath17 where @xmath18 stands for the perimeter of @xmath19 in @xmath12 and @xmath20 is the solution of @xmath21 with the positions @xmath22 we are thus lead to study the variational problem @xmath23 let us note that the condition @xmath24 in the problem is nothing but a volume constraint imposed on the admissible sets , indeed , by definition of @xmath25 , it is equivalent to @xmath26 .    the problem has been presented in @xcite as a mathematical paradigm for the phenomenon of energy - driven pattern formation associated with competing short and long - range interactions . recently",
    "an increasing interest has been devoted to the second order variational analysis of energy functionals which exhibit this competing behaviour .",
    "indeed it has been successfully applied to prove stability and minimality criteria in several contexts ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "directly related to our problem is the work by ren and wei and by choksi and sternberg ( cfr .",

    ", they calculate the second variation of at a critical configuration and , among several other applications , they construct examples of periodical critical configurations and find conditions under which their second variation is positive definite",
    ".    a different approach is taken in @xcite , where the authors consider the problem of minimizing the functional in the periodic case , i.e. , when @xmath12 is the @xmath27-dimensional flat torus .",
    "they prove the local minimality of regular critical configurations whose second variation is positive definite . in this direction",
    "goes also our present work , whose aim is to prove that a similar minimality criterion holds true for the problem .    in order to describe our main result",
    ", we recall that , if @xmath19 is a sufficiently regular critical set for @xmath28 , then the following euler - lagrange equation holds : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the relative boundary of @xmath19 in @xmath12 , @xmath31 indicates the sum of the principal curvatures of @xmath32 and the constant @xmath33 is a lagrange multiplier associated to the volume constraint .",

    "in other words , we study whether we may deduce the stability of a critical set @xmath19 from the positivity of the second variation .",
    "our goal is to prove that a regular critical point with positive second variation is indeed an isolated local minimum .",
    "this is achieved in the following theorem .",

    "going back to the functionals @xmath58 defined in , as we already observed , it is well known that , for @xmath59 , they @xmath8-converge in the @xmath0 topology to @xmath60 . as a corollary of the previous theorem we can thus obtain the following stability result in the spirit of ( * ? ? ?",

    "some comments are in order on the differences between the periodic case ( studied in @xcite ) and the neumann boundary case .",

    "we remark that in @xcite the neumann boundary case was considered only under a restrictive assumption that the set @xmath19 does not intersect the boundary of @xmath12 .",
