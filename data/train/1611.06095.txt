    "consequently , @xmath0-decay has been studied in great detail , both from theoretical and experimental points of view .",

    "currently the best bounds are @xmath3 sensitivities in excess of @xmath4 ys in experiments using @xmath5xe @xcite and @xmath6ge @xcite are expected in the future .",
    "contributions to @xmath0-decay can be classified as either long - range ( lrm ) @xcite or short - range mechanisms ( srm ) @xcite , depending on whether all of the virtually exchanged particles are heavy or not , see fig .",
    "[ fig : srmlrm ] . for the short - range mechanisms , srm , the experimental limits imply typical masses of heavy intermediate particles and an lnv scale @xmath7 in the ballpark of ( a few ) tev .",
    "therefore , the lhc could possibly provide a cross - check whether or not these contributions can be dominant in @xmath0-decay @xcite .    naturally , for a realistic comparison of the sensitivities of @xmath0-decay with the lhc the theoretical calculations must be made as reliable as possible , which is particularly demanding for @xmath0-decay .",
    "one well - known source of difficulties in this case are uncertainties in the nuclear matrix elements ( nme ) , which spread by a factor of typically @xmath1 2 comparing different calculations . improving the predictions for @xmath0-nmes is a serious challenge for nuclear structure theory , which is going to take time and significant efforts . on the other hand , recently it has been pointed out that one important effect has so far been missing in the theoretical treatment of @xmath0-decay @xcite : qcd corrections .",
    "this effect , being perturbative , is much better controllable theoretically than the essentially non - perturbative ( in quantum field theory sense ) physics involved in the nme - calculations . as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite gluon exchange diagrams can lead to the so called `` color - mismatch '' in the products of the color - singlet quark currents giving rise to an appreciable mixing between different @xmath0-effective operators .",
    "the vastly differing numerical values of nmes for different operators then result in dramatic changes of the limits on the wilson coefficients of some particular operators .",
    "this feature is pertinent to the srms of @xmath0-decay .",
    "it has been recently demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that the color - mismatch effect is absent in the case of the lrms of @xmath0-decay and , therefore , for this class of mechanisms the qcd corrections are not so crucial .    for such a fairly low - energy process as @xmath0-decay an effective operator description is adequate for calculating the decay rate .",
    "this rather straightforward observation forms the framework of the original papers @xcite where the basis of the effective @xmath0-decay @xmath8 operators was introduced and generic formulas for the @xmath0-decay half - live were derived .",
    "more recently this approach has been developed in refs .",
    "@xcite where we derived the qcd - corrected @xmath0-decay half - life formulas for both srm and lrm .- decay . ] from the more fundamental high - energy point of view , however , contributions to @xmath0-decay originate from some renormalizable lnv extension of the sm , i.e. high - scale models ( hsm ) , whose parameters are the couplings and masses of experimentally yet unknown particles .    a list of all possible hsms representing uv completions of the above - mentioned @xmath0-decay @xmath8 operators was given in ref .",
    "@xcite and from that paper , in principle , all the hsms contributing to @xmath0-decay via the short - range mechanism can be found .",
    "the purpose of our present paper is to provide a bridge between these two descriptions  in terms of the effective operators and the hsms  taking into account the effect of the above - mentioned qcd corrections .",
    "upper limits derived on the wilson coefficients of the @xmath0-decay effective operators ( low energy approach ) @xcite can be converted into lower limits on the mass scales of the hsms listed in ref .",
    "@xcite and we provide tables of these limits , using updated experimental lower bounds on the @xmath0-decay half - life , for all `` elementary '' hsms ( see section [ sec : short - range - limits ] ) .",
    "while these `` translation rules '' can be applied in a rather straightforward manner to any particular hsm , for which only one feynman diagram contributes significantly , there are many example models in the literature where this is not the case . in the presence of more than one significant diagram a careful examination of their contributions to different operators",
    "is required for arriving at the correct answer .",
