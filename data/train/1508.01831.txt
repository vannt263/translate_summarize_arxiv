    "magnetic nanoparticles composed of two coupled magnetic phases with distinct magnetic properties , such as magnetic anisotropy , are presently extensively studied , owing to their potentials for a wide variety of technological applications ranging from magnetic recording @xcite to biomedicine.@xcite in particular , nanoparticles with the most commonly achieved core - shell morphology are grown either by vacuum chamber condensation methods @xcite or more often by colloidal chemistry methods.@xcite the latter methods are low - cost and very versatile , producing nanoparticles with a very narrow size distribution and a variety of combined materials for the core and the shell . owing to the flexibility offered by synthetic methods ,",
    "nanoparticle shape has emerged as a promising tool for tailoring the magnetic properties at the nanoscale.@xcite prominent examples include engineering of nanoparticle shape to obtain a better response for the biomedical imaging @xcite or magnetic hyperthermia applications.@xcite nanoparticles with a ferromagnetic ( fm)-core / antiferromagnetic ( af)-shell morphology are well known to exhibit the exchange bias effect after been field - cooled in a field.@xcite . two characteristic features of the effect being the horizontal shift of the hysteresis loop in the direction opposite to the cooling field and the widening of the loop , expressed by an increase of the coercivity relative to the bare fm particle . in most cases ,",
    "the exchange bias phenomenon arises from the pinning of magnetic moments at the interface between the two materials.@xcite thus the material properties , the size and the atomic structure of the interface are crucial factors determining the existence and the strength of this phenomenon .    despite the abundance of experimental and theoretical works focusing on the role of the core size and shell size in controlling the exchange bias phenomenon in bi - phased nanoparticles @xcite ,",

    "at the same time , theoretical works on the magnetic properties of core - shell nanoparticles with non - spherical shape are a few,@xcite despite the necessity to unravel the interplay between exchange bias and particle shape .",
    "in addition to the role of particle shape , the importance of the fm - af interface quality in controlling the magnetic properties of the exchange - coupled bi - phased nanoparticle has been recognized . in a recent work , mao _",

    "our main conclusions are that cubes show higher coercivity and lower exchange bias field than spheres , while even moderate interface roughness washes out the shape - dependence of the exchange bias effect .",

    "for both cubes and spheres , @xmath58 shows a monotonous decrease with increasing roughness owing to the mixing of fm - af at the interface that makes less effective the dragging of the shell interface moments by the core - interface moments during the magnetization reversal of the fm .",

    "the distinct effect of roughness on cubes and spheres is related to the compensation of their interfaces .",
    "in particular , the increase of @xmath59 with roughness in @xmath61 is in accordance to the predictions of the random field model @xcite , namely that roughness on a flat compensated af interface , creates uncompensated spins required for the loop to shift .",
    "contrary to this trend , atomic scale roughness on uncompensated interfaces reduces the number of uncompensated spins leading to suppression of @xmath59 , as observed on the flat interface of @xmath73 and the curved interfaces of both spheres . as the degree of roughness increases , the shape - dependent @xmath59 ,",
    "is gradually suppressed and cubes and spheres of similar size have very similar values of @xmath59 for @xmath74 .",
    "furthermore , an interesting feature seen in fig.[f3b ] is the pronounced minimum of @xmath59 at @xmath75 for @xmath73 and @xmath69 .",
    "this stems form the wide dispersion of @xmath59 values due to disorder that often assume positive values and produce on average a minimum in @xmath72 .",
    "the non - monotonous dependence of @xmath59 on roughness has been previously observed@xcite in exchanged - coupled bilayers and interpreted as the competition between interface exchange and zeeman energy of the af spins at the shell - interface , when the interface exchange is antiferromagnetic .",
    "we show here that a similar mechanism acts in core - shell nanoparticles irrespectively of their shape .",
    "the origin of the exchange bias effect in our model is the net ( uncompensated ) af moment ( @xmath76 ) that is exchanged coupled to the fm.@xcite due to large anisotropy of the af , which nearly freezes the net moment , the resulting exchange bias field acting on the fm is expected to obey a linear scaling law , namely @xmath77 .",
    "when an assembly of nanoparticle is considered , @xmath78 is expected to assume different values due to different realizations of the interface disorder . in this case , the scaling coefficient can be written as @xmath79 , where the denominator expresses the variation of @xmath78 values due to interface randomness .",

    "the linear fit to the data provides the average sensitivity parameter ( @xmath0 ) , which is found to increase as the the uncompensation of the af interface increases .",
    "it is notable also , that larger dispersion of @xmath59 values occurs for cubes than for spheres , because interface structural imperfections constitute a stronger perturbation to compensated ( cubic ) interface , namely an assembly of cubes is characterized by larger dispersion of @xmath59values than an assembly of spheres with the same size and degree of interface roughness .",

    "in conclusion , our simulations of the exchange bias effect in fm core - af shell nanoparticles with cubical and spherical shape show that among particles with ideal ( non - disordered ) core - shell interfaces cubes have higher coercive field ( @xmath83 ) , owing to the larger number of dragged af interface spins . this trend remains for uncompensated interfaces even in the presence of interface roughness . for compensated interfaces however , weak disorder can reverse this situation rendering spheres harder than cubes . on the other hand , spheres exhibit higher exchange bias field ( @xmath84 ) due to the larger number of uncompensated spins on curved fm - af interfaces . a non - monotonous dependence of @xmath59 on roughness is observed , for small nanoparticles ( @xmath85 ) with antiferromagnetic interface exchange coupling and uncompensated interfaces , similar to the case of exchange coupled layered systems",
