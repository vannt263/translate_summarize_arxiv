    "advances in technology underpinning multiple domains have increased the capacity to generate and store data and metadata relating to domain processes .",
    "the field of data science is continuously evolving to meet the challenge of gleaning insights from these large data sets , with extensive research in exact algorithms , heuristics and meta - heuristics for solving combinatorial optimisation problems .",
    "the primary advantage of using exact methods is the guarantee of finding the global optimum for the problem .",
    "however , a disadvantage when solving complex ( np - hard ) problems is the exponential growth of the execution time proportional to the problem instance size @xcite .",
    "heuristics tend to be efficient , but solution quality can not be guaranteed and techniques are often not versatile @xcite .",
    "meta - heuristics attempt to consolidate these two approaches and deliver an acceptable solution in a reasonable time frame .",
    "a large number of meta - heuristics designed for solving complex problems exist in the literature and the genetic algorithm ( ga ) has emerged as a prominent technique , using intensive global search heuristics that explore a search space intelligently to solve optimisation problems .",
    "although the algorithms must traverse large spaces , the computationally intensive calculations can be performed independently .",
    "compute unified device architecture ( cuda ) is nvidia s parallel computing platform which is well suited to many computational tasks , particularly where data parallelism is possible . implementing a ga to perform cluster analysis on vast data sets using this platform",
    "allows one to mine though the data relatively quickly and at a fraction of the cost of large data centres or computational grids .",
    "a number of authors have considered parallel architectures to accelerate gas ( see @xcite as examples ) .",
    "while the work of @xcite is conceptually similar to the implementation proposed in this paper , a key difference is our choice of fitness function for the clustering scheme .",
    "giada and marsili propose an unsupervised , parameter - free approach to finding data clusters , based on the maximum likelihood principle @xcite .",
    "they derive a log - likelihood function , where a given cluster configuration can be assessed to determine whether it represents the inherent structure for the dataset : cluster configurations which approach the maximum log - likelihood are better representatives of the data structure .",
    "this log - likelihood function is thus a natural candidate for the fitness function in a ga implementation , where the population continually evolves to produce a cluster configuration which maximises the log - likelihood .",
    "the optimal number of clusters is a free parameter , unlike in traditional techniques where the number of clusters needs to be specified a priori .",
    "while unsupervised approaches have been considered ( see @xcite and references therein ) , the advantage of the giada and marsili approach is that it has a natural interpretation for clustering in the application domain explored here .",
    "monitoring intraday clustering of financial instruments allows one to better understand market characteristics and systemic risks .",
    "while genetic algorithms provide a versatile methodology for identifying such clusters , serial implementations are computationally intensive and can take a long time to converge to a best approximation . in this paper",
    ", we introduce a maintainable and scalable master - slave parallel genetic algorithm ( pga ) framework for unsupervised cluster analysis on the cuda platform , which is able to detect clusters using the giada and marsili likelihood function . by applying the proposed cluster analysis approach and examining the clustering behaviour of financial instruments ,",
    "this offers a unique perspective to monitoring the intraday characteristics of the stock market and the detection of structural changes in near - real - time .",
    "the novel implementation presented in this paper builds on the contribution of cieslakiewicz @xcite . while this paper provides an overview and specific use - case for the algorithm ,",
    "the authors are investigating aspects of adjoint parameter tuning , performance scalability and the impact on solution quality for varying stock universe sizes and cluster types .",
    "this paper proceeds as follows : section 2 introduces cluster analysis , focusing on the maximum likelihood approach proposed by giada and marsili @xcite .",
    "section 3 discusses the master - slave pga .",
    "section 4 discusses the cuda computational platform and our specific implementation .",
    "section 5 discusses data and results from this analysis , before concluding in section 6 .",
    "cluster analysis groups objects according to metadata describing the objects or their associations @xcite .",
    "the goal is to ensure that objects within a group exhibit similar characteristics and are unrelated to objects in other groups .",
    "the greater the homogeneity within a group , and the greater the heterogeneity between groups , the more pronounced the clustering . in order to isolate clusters of similar objects",
    ", one needs to utilise a data clustering approach that will recover inherent structures efficiently .",
    "the correlation measure is an approach to standardise the data by using the statistical interdependence between data points .",
    "the correlation indicates the direction ( positive or negative ) and the degree or strength of the relationship between two data points . the most common correlation coefficient which measures the relationship between data points is the _ pearson correlation coefficient _ , which is sensitive only to a linear relationship between them .",
    "the pearson correlation is + 1 in the case of a perfect positive linear relationship and -1 in the case of a perfect negative linear relationship and some value between -1 and + 1 in all other cases , with values close to 0 signalling negligible interdependence .",
    "any specific clustering procedure entails optimising some kind of criterion , such as minimising the within - cluster variance or maximising the distance between the objects or clusters .",
    "maximum likelihood estimation is a method of estimating the parameters of a statistical model .",
    "data clustering on the other hand deals with the problem of classifying or categorising a set of @xmath0 objects or clusters , so that the objects within a group or cluster are more similar than objects belonging to different groups .",
    "if each object is identified by @xmath1 measurements , then an object can be represented as a tuple , @xmath2 , @xmath3 in a @xmath1-dimensional space .",
    "data clustering will try to identify clusters as more densely populated regions in this vector space .",
    "thus , a configuration of clusters is represented by a set @xmath4 of integer labels , where @xmath5 denotes the cluster that object @xmath6 belongs to and @xmath0 is the number of objects @xcite ( if @xmath7 , then object @xmath6 and object @xmath8 reside in the same cluster ) , and if @xmath5 takes on values from @xmath9 to @xmath10 and @xmath11 , then each cluster is a _",
    "cluster constituting one object only .",
    "one can apply super - paramagnetic ordering of a @xmath12-state potts model directly for cluster identification @xcite . in a market potts model ,",
    "each stock can take on @xmath12-states and each state can be represented by a cluster of similar stocks @xcite .",
    "cluster membership is indicative of some commonality among the cluster members .",
    "each stock has a component of its dynamics as a function of the state it is in and a component of its dynamics influenced by stock specific noise .",
    "in addition , there may be global couplings that influence all the stocks , i.e. the external field that represents a market mode .",
    "in the super - paramagnetic clustering approach , the cost function can be considered as a hamiltonian whose low energy states correspond to cluster configurations that are most compatible with the data sample .",
    "structures are then identified with configurations @xmath13 for the cluster indices @xmath5 , which represents cluster to which the @xmath6-th object belongs .",
    "this allows one to interpret @xmath5 as a potts spin in the potts model hamiltonian with @xmath14 decreasing with the distance between objects @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian takes on the form : @xmath15 where the spins @xmath5 can take on @xmath12-states and the external magnetic fields are given by @xmath16 .",
    "the first term represents common internal influences and the second term represents external influences .",
    "we ignore the second term when fitting data , as we include shared factors directly in later sections when we discuss information and risk and the influence of these on price changes .    in the potts model approach one can think of the coupling parameters @xmath14 as being a function of the correlation coefficient @xcite .",
    "this is used to specify a distance function that is decreasing with distance between objects .",
    "if all the spins are related in this way then each pair of spins is connect by some non - vanishing coupling @xmath17 . in this model ,",
    "the case where there is only one cluster can be thought of as a ground state .",
    "as the system becomes more excited , it could break up into additional clusters and each cluster would have specific potts magnetisations , even though nett magnetisation may remain zero for the complete system .",
    "generically , the correlation would then be both a function of time and temperature in order to encode both the evolution of clusters , as well as the hierarchy of clusters as a function of temperature . in the basic approach ,",
    "one is looking for the lowest energy state that fits the data . in order to parameterise the model efficiently",
    "one can choose to make the noh ansatz @xcite and use this to develop a maximum - likelihood approach @xcite rather than explicitly solving the potts hamiltonian numerically @xcite .",
    "following giada and marsili @xcite , we assume that price increments evolve under noh @xcite model dynamics , whereby objects belonging to the same cluster should share a common component : @xmath18 here , @xmath19 represents the features of object @xmath6 and @xmath5 is the label of the cluster that the object belongs to .",
    "the data has been normalised to have zero mean and unit variance .",
    "@xmath20 is a vector describing the deviation of object @xmath6 from the features of cluster @xmath21 and includes measurement errors , while @xmath22 describes cluster - specific features .",
    "@xmath23 is a loading factor that emphasises the similarity or difference between objects in cluster @xmath21 . in this research",
    "the data set refers to a set of the objects , denoting @xmath0 assets or stocks , and their features are prices across @xmath1 days in the data set .",
    "the variable @xmath6 is indexing stocks or assets , whilst @xmath24 is indexing days .    if @xmath25 , all objects with @xmath26 are identical , whilst if @xmath27 , all objects are different .",
    "the range of the cluster index is from 1 to @xmath0 in order to allow for singleton clusters of one object or asset each .    if one takes equation 2 as a statistical hypothesis and assumes that both @xmath28 and @xmath29 are gaussian vectors with zero mean and unit variance , for values of @xmath30 , it is possible to compute the probability density @xmath31 for any given set of parameters @xmath32 by observing the data set @xmath33 as a realisation of the common component of equation 2 as follows @xcite : @xmath34 the variable @xmath35 is the dirac delta function and @xmath36 denotes the mathematical expectation . for a given cluster structure @xmath37 ,",
    "the likelihood is maximal when the parameter @xmath23 takes the values @xmath38 the quantity @xmath39 in equation 4 denotes the number of objects in cluster @xmath21 , i.e. @xmath40 the variable @xmath41 is the internal correlation of the @xmath42 cluster , denoted by the following equation : @xmath43    the variable @xmath44 is the _ pearson correlation coefficient _ of the data , denoted by the following equation : @xmath45    the maximum likelihood of structure @xmath46 can be written as @xmath47 ( see @xcite ) , where the resulting likelihood function per feature @xmath48 is denoted by @xmath49    from equation 8 , it follows that @xmath50 for clusters of objects that are uncorrelated , i.e. where @xmath51 or @xmath52 or when the objects are grouped in singleton clusters for all the cluster indexes ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "equation 8 illustrates that the resulting maximum likelihood function for @xmath46 depends on the _ pearson correlation cofficient _ @xmath44 and hence exhibits the following advantages in comparison to conventional clustering methods :    * it is * unsupervised * : the optimal number of clusters is unknown _ a priori _ and not fixed at the beginning * the interpretation of results is * transparent * in terms of the model , namely equation 2 .",
    "giada and marsili state that @xmath54 provides a measure of structure inherent in the cluster configuration represented by the set @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "the higher the value , the more pronounced the structure .",
    "in order to localise clusters of normalised stock returns in financial data , giada and marsili made use of a _ simulated annealing _ algorithm @xcite , with @xmath56 as the cost function for their application of the log - likelihood function on real - world data sets to substantiate their approach . this",
    "was then compared to other clustering algorithms , such as _ k - means _ ,",
    "_ single linkage _ , _ centroid linkage _ , _ average linkage _ , _ merging _ and _ deterministic maximisation",
    "the technique was successfully applied to south african financial data by mbambiso et al . , using a serial implementation of a _ simulated annealing _",
    "algorithm ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "_ simulated annealing _ and _ deterministic maximisation _ provided acceptable approximations to the maximum likelihood structure , but were inherently computationally expensive .",
    "we promote the use of pgas as a viable an approach to approximate the maximum likelihood structure .",
    "@xmath48 will be used as the fitness function and a pga algorithm will be used to find the maximum for @xmath48 , in order to efficiently isolate clusters in correlated financial data .",
    "one of the key advantages of gas is that they are conceptually simple .",
    "the core algorithm can be summarised into the following steps : _ initialise population _ , _ evolve individuals _",
    ", _ evaluate fitness _",
    ", _ select individuals to survive to the next generation_. gas exhibit the trait of broad applicability @xcite , as they can be applied to any problem whose solution domain can be quantified by a function which needs to be optimised .",
    "specific genetic operators are applied to the parents , in the process of reproduction , which then give rise to offspring .",
    "the genetic operators can be classified as follows :    the purpose of selection is to isolate fitter individuals in the population and allow them to propogate in order to give rise to new offspring with higher fitness values .",
    "we implemented the _",
    "stochastic universal sampling selection operator _ , where individuals are mapped to contiguous segments on a line in proportion to their fitness values @xcite .",
    "individuals are then selected by sampling the line at uniformly spaced intervals .",
    "while fitter individuals have a higher probability of being selected , this technique improves the chances that weaker individuals will be selected , allowing diversity to enter the population and reducing the probability of convergence to a local optimum .",
    "crossover is the process of mating two individuals , with the expectation that they can produce a fitter offspring @xcite .",
    "the crossover genetic operation involves the selection of random loci to mark a cross site within the two parent chromosomes , copying the genes to the offspring . a bespoke",
    "_ knowledge - based crossover _ operator was developed for our implementation @xcite , in order to incorporate domain knowledge and improve the rate of convergence .",
    "mutation is the key driver of diversity in the candidate solution set or search space @xcite .",
    "it is usually applied after crossover and aims to ensure that genetic information is randomly distributed , preventing the algorithm from being trapped in local minima .",
    "it introduces new genetic structures in the population by randomly modifying some of its building blocks and enables the algorithm to traverse the search space globally .",
    "coley states that fitness - proportional selection does not necessarily favour the selection of any particular individual , even if it is the fittest @xcite . thus the fittest individuals may not survive an evolutionary cycle .",
    "elitism is the process of preserving the fittest individuals by inherent promotion to the next generation , without undergoing any of the genetic transformations of crossover or mutation @xcite .",
    "replacement is the last stage of any evolution cycle , where the algorithm needs to replace old members of the current population with new members @xcite .",
    "this mechanism ensures that the population size remains constant , while the weakest individuals in each generation are dropped .",
    "+ although gas are very effective for solving complex problems , this positive trait can unfortunately be offset by long execution times , due to the traversal of the search space .",
    "gas lend themselves to parallelisation , provided the fitness values can be determined independently for each of the candidate solutions . while a number of schemes have been proposed in the literature to achieve this parallelisation ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) , we have chosen to implement the _ master - slave _ model .",
    "master - slave gas , also denoted as global pgas , involve a single population , but distributed amongst multiple processing units for determination of fitness values and the consequent application of genetic operators .",
    "they allow for computation on shared - memory processing entities or any type of distributed system topology , for example grid computing @xcite .",
    "ismail provides a summary of the key features of the master - slave pga @xcite : the algorithm uses a single population ( stored by the master ) and the fitness evaluation of all of the individuals is performed in parallel ( by the slaves ) .",
    "communication occurs only as each slave receives the individual ( or subset of individuals ) to evaluate and when the slaves return the fitness values , sometimes after mutation has been applied with the given probability .",
    "the particular algorithm we implemented is _ synchronous _ , i.e. the master waits until it has received the fitness values for all individuals in the population before proceeding with selection and mutation .",
    "the _ synchronous _ master - slave pga thus has the same properties as a conventional ga , except evaluation of the fitness of the population is achieved at a faster rate .",
    "the algorithm is relatively easy to implement and a significant speedup can be expected if the communications cost does not dominate the computation cost .",
    "the whole process has to wait for the slowest processor to finish its fitness evaluations until the selection operator can be applied .",
    "a number of authors have used the message parsing interface ( mpi ) paradigm to implement a master - slave pga .",
    "digalakis and margaritis implement a synchronous mpi pga and shared - memory pga , whereby fitness computations are parallelised and other genetic operators are applied by the master node only @xcite .",
    "they demonstrate a computation speed - up which scales linearly with the number of processors for large population sizes .",
    "zhang et al .",
    "use a centralised control island model to concurrently apply genetic operators to sub - groups , with a bespoke migration strategy using elite individuals from sub - groups @xcite .",
    "nan et al . used the matlab parallel computing and distributed computing toolboxes to develop a master - slave pga @xcite , demonstrating its efficacy on the image registration problem when using a cluster computing configuration .    for our implementation",
    ", we made use of the nvidia cuda platform to achieve massive parallelism by utilising the graphical processing unit ( gpu ) streaming multiprocessors ( sm ) as slaves , and the cpu as master .",
    "compute unified device architecture ( cuda ) is nvidia s platform for massively parallel high performance computing on the nvidia gpus .",
    "compute unified device architecture ( cuda ) is nvidia s platform for massively parallel high - performance computing on the nvidia gpus . at its core",
    "are three key abstractions : a hierarchy of thread groups , shared memories , and barrier synchronisation .",
    "full details on the execution environment , thread hierarchy , memory hierarchy and thread synchronisation schemes have been omitted here , but we refer the reader to nvidia technical documentation @xcite for a comprehensive discussion .",
    "the cuda algorithm and the respective testing tools were developed using microsoft visual studio 2012 professional , with the nvidia nsight extension for cuda - c projects .",
    "the following configurations were tested to determine the versatility of the cuda clustering algorithms on the following architectures :    .development , testing and benchmarking environments [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      in this section , we illustrate a sample of the resultant cluster configurations which were generated from our model , represented graphically as msts @xcite .",
    "this serves as a particular domain application which provides an example of resulting cluster configurations which have meaningful interpretations .",
    "the thickness of the vertices connecting nodes gives an indication of the strength of the correlation between stocks .",
    "the south african equity market is often characterised by diverging behaviour between financial / industrial stocks and resource stocks and strong coupling with global market trends .        in figure 2 , we see 4 distinct clusters emerge as a result of the early morning trading patterns , just after market open .",
    "most notably , a 6-node financial / industrial cluster ( slm , sbk , asa , shf , gfi , oml ) and a 3-node resource cluster ( bil , sol , agl ) . at face value",
    ", these configurations would be expected , however we notice that gfi , a gold mining company , appears in the financial cluster and fsr , a banking company , does not appear in the financial cluster .",
    "these are examples of short - term decoupling behaviour of individual stocks due to idiosyncratic factors .",
    "figure 3 illustrates the effect of the uk market open on local trading patterns .",
    "we see a clear emergence of a single large cluster , indicating that trading activity by uk investors has a significant impact on the local market .",
    "when examining the large single cluster , all of the stocks have either primary of secondary listings in the us and uk .",
    "in particular , sab and ang have secondary listings on the london stock exchange ( lse ) , whereas bil and agl have primary listings on the lse @xcite .",
    "it is also unusual to see such a strong link ( correlation ) between agl , a mining company , and cfr , a luxury goods company .",
    "this may be evidence that significant uk trading in these 2 stocks can cause a short - term elevated correlation , which may not be meaningful or sustainable .",
    "figure 4 considers midday trading patterns .",
    "we see that the clustering effect from uk trading has dissipated and multiple disjoint clusters have emerged .",
    "cfr has decoupled from agl in the 2 hours after the uk market open , as we might expect .",
    "we see a 4-node financial / industrial cluster ( npn , mtn , asa , imp ) and 4-node resource cluster ( agl , sab , sol , bil ) ; imp , a mining company , appears in the financial / industrial cluster .",
    "figure 5 illustrates the effect of the us market open on local trading patterns .",
    "similar to what we observed in figure 3 , we see the emergence of a large single cluster , driven by elevated short - term correlations amongst constituent stocks .",
    "this provides further evidence that significant trading by foreign investors in local stocks can cause a material impact on stock market dynamics .",
    "this paper verifies that the giada and marsili @xcite likelihood function is a viable , parallelisable approach for isolating residual clusters in datasets on a gpu platform .",
    "key advantages compared to conventional clustering methods are : 1 ) the method is unsupervised and 2 ) the interpretation of results is transparent in terms of the model .",
    "the implementation of the master - slave pga showed that efficiency depends on various algorithm settings .",
    "the type of mutation operator utilised has a significant effect on the algorithm s efficiency to isolate the optimal solution in the search space , whilst the other adjoint parameter settings primarily impact the convergence rate . according to the benchmark test results , the cuda pga implementation runs 10 - 15 times faster than the serial ga implementation in matlab for detecting clusters in 18-stock real world correlation matrices . specifically , when using the nvidia gtx titan black card , clusters are recovered in sub - second speed , demonstrating the efficiency of the algorithm .",
    "provided intraday correlation matrices can be estimated from high frequency data , this significantly reduced computation time suggests intraday cluster identification can be practical , for near - real - time risk assessment for financial practitioners .",
    "detecting cluster anomalies and measuring persistence of effects may provide financial practitioners with useful information to support local trading strategies . from the sample results shown ,",
    "it is clear that intraday financial market evolution is dynamic , reflecting effects which are both exogenous and endogenous .",
    "the ability of the clustering algorithm to capture interpretable and meaningful characteristics of the system dynamics , and the generality of its construction , suggests the method can be successful in other domains .",
    "further investigations include adjoint parameter tuning and performance scalability for varying stock universe sizes and cluster types , quantifying the variability of solution quality on the gtx architecture as a result of non - ecc memory usage and the investigation of alternative cost - effective parallelisation schemes . given the spmd architecture used by cuda , the required data dependence across thread blocks restricts the assignment of population genes to threads and results in a large number of synchronisation calls to ensure consistency of each generation .",
    "an mpi island model with distributed fitness computation and controlled migration is perhaps a more well - posed solution to explore @xcite , however the cost of the setup required to achieve the equivalent speed - up provided by cuda should be justified .",
    "this work is based on the research supported in part by the national research foundation of south africa ( grant numbers 87830 , 74223 and 70643 ) .",
