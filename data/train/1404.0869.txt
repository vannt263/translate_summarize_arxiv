    "the formalism of master stability function ( msf ) was proposed by pecora and carroll to study the stability of synchronization of coupled identical dynamical systems on different networks on a unified platform . in part",
    "i @xcite , we extend the formalism of msf to coupled nearly identical dynamical systems where the different systems have one or more node dependent parameters ( ndps ) . we apply msf to study stability of some networks and find that the stability of synchronization can be improved by a suitable realisation of ndp .",
    "we demonstrate the improvement of synchronization by considering the example of a star network .",
    "this improvement depends on the structure of the eigenvectors of the coupling matrix . in the ring network ,",
    "the ndp does not change the synchronization by a significant amount .",
    "the structure of a network plays a major role towards the synchronization of dynamical systems on networks . as discussed in the introduction of ref .",
    "@xcite , several studies of comparing the synchronization properties of different networks of coupled identical systems have been carried out .",
    "the scale free networks and the small world networks are shown to enhance the synchronizability for coupled identical dynamical systems and this may be due to their smaller shortest path lengths  @xcite .",
    "but , other network parameters also play a role in synchronization .",
    "it has been found that keeping the path lengths unchanged and increasing the degree heterogeneity reduces the synchronizability of scale free networks  @xcite .",
    "this reduction can be overcome by adding suitable weights to the edges of the networks  @xcite .",
    "the study of the relation between the network structure and synchronizability for coupled identical systems has motivated us to study a similar problem for coupled nearly identical systems .",
    "one such study is reported in @xcite where we show that synchronizability of a network of coupled nearly identical systems can be better than that for coupled identical systems .",
    "this is illustrated by using the example of a star network where we show that the critical value of the number of nodes for size instability of synchronization of coupled identical systems can be enhanced by a judicious choice of values of ndp for different nodes . in this paper",
    ", we take another approach to the problem , i.e. to construct a network showing optimized synchronizability",
    ". we will refer to this as an optimized network ( on ) .    for coupled identical systems , donetti , hurtado , and m. a. muoz @xcite have constructed optimized networks using msf showing better synchronizability .",
    "these ons are found to have an interwoven structure with a narrow distribution of degree , and of betweenness centrality .",
    "also , it has been observed that the disassortative mixing of degrees of nodes ( negative values of the assortative coefficient ) increases the synchronizability of network of coupled identical systems @xcite .",
    "but , as the disassortative mixing becomes larger , there exists a threshold of the assortative coefficient below which the network loses its synchronizability @xcite .    when we consider coupled nearly identical systems , a new interesting aspect emerges since the nodes can be identified by their parameter value",
    ". thus the question of relevance is ",
    "what is the relation between the network properties and the ndp in the on ? \"",
    "e.g. which nodes are likely to be hubs , i.e. have large degree and which nodes are likely to have smaller degree .",
    "many similar questions can be raised in relation to other network parameters and we study them in this paper . some of the preliminary results of the present study were earlier reported in  @xcite .    in this paper",
