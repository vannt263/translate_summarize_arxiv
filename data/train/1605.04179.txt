    "since the discovery of superconductivity in the element mercury over a hundred years ago,@xcite numerous superconductors have been found continually in a diversity of materials .",
    "these superconductors can be classified into five groups , i.e. , 1 ) elements , 2 ) alloys or intermetallics , 3 ) inorganic compounds , 4 ) organic compounds , and 5 ) polymers . among them ,",
    "the inorganic superconductors have been studied most extensively and intensively in recent decades , primarily because of the discovery of high temperature superconductivity in cuprates@xcite and more recently in iron pnictides@xcite .    while the nature of superconductivity was elucidated successfully over half a century ago in terms of cooper pairing mediated by electron - phonon interactions,@xcite the theory by itself supplies only limited guidance on exploring new superconductors , let alone for the exotic superconductors beyond the electron - phonon mechanism . even if a material is theoretically designed and calculated to be a desirable superconductors ( e.g. , with higher superconducting transition temperature @xmath3 ) , the proposed material must be thermodynamically or at least kinetically stable , such that it could be synthesized .",
    "the latter issue seems to be more crucial and challenging . under this circumstance",
    ", the knowledge of crystal chemistry of a certain type of material is important and , it could be helpful to look for new superconductors . as a matter of fact , in the progress of finding new cuprate superconductors ,",
    "the crystal chemistry has played an indispensable role.@xcite    iron - based superconductivity was first discovered in lafepo in 2006 by h. hosono and co - workers.@xcite the superconducting transition temperature @xmath3 was only 3.2 k , which did not draw instant attentions from the community of superconductivity .",
    "two years later , the same group reported superconductivity at 26 k in lafeaso@xmath4f@xmath5.@xcite this breakthrough immediately aroused great research interests .",
    "x. h. chen et al.@xcite successfully pushed the @xmath3 value beyond the mcmillan limit by the substitution of sm for la , marking the birth of the second htscs .",
    "the @xmath3 record of @xmath655 k was also created at the period.@xcite in the following days of the year 2008 , other three types of fe - based superconductors ( fescs ) were found one after another.@xcite so far , the iron - based htsc family have included several dozens members .",
    "although there have been a lot of reviews on the subject of iron - based superconductivity,@xcite a complete classification and description for the crystal structures of fescs is still lacking . in this article , we present a comprehensive review on the crystal chemistry of fescs , aiming to explore new fescs in a rational way . we will not concentrate on the structural details , and the structural phase transitions are simply not touched .",
    "this related information can be found in ref .",
    "crystal chemistry seeks for the principles describing composition - structure - property relations in crystalline materials .",
    "let us first discuss features of the chemical composition of fescs .",
    "taken lafeaso@xmath4f@xmath5 ( so - called `` 1111 '' material because it is a quaternary equiatomic compound ) for example , the constituent elements ( sequencing in the electronegativity order according to the standard nomenclature of inorganic compounds ) la@xmath7 , fe@xmath8 , as@xmath9 and o@xmath10 belong to different groups that are called hard acid , soft acid , soft base and hard base , respectively , in the concept of `` hard and soft acids and bases '' ( hsab)@xcite . if we employ a notation @xmath11 for the 1111 compounds , the characteristic of the constituent elements is well defined : @xmath12 represents a `` hard '' ( meaning non - polarizable ) cation with the smallest electronegativity ; @xmath13 denotes a `` soft '' ( meaning polarizable ) cation ( it is normally a @xmath14-block transition metal , but here it is virtually fe for fescs ) ; @xmath2 stands for a `` soft '' anion ( e.g. , a pnictogen or a chalcogen ) ; @xmath15 is a `` hard '' anion with the largest electronegativity . according to the hsab rule,@xcite @xmath12 tends to bond with @xmath15 ( an ionic bonding ) , and @xmath13 combines with @xmath2 ( covalent bonding dominated ) , as depicted in fig .",
    "the resultant two block layers @xmath16@xmath17 and @xmath18@xmath1 are linked by @xmath19 ionic bonding . as for other fescs",
    ", the hsab concept basically holds .",
    "so , we employ the @xmath20 ( simplified as @xmath21 ) notation throughout this article .",
    "characteristic of the constituent elements and the chemical bonding in 1111-type @xmath11 iron - based superconductors.,width=264 ]    the combination of @xmath11 leads to many members in the 1111 family . a review paper published in 2008 lists over 150 @xmath11 individuals.@xcite more 1111 compounds",
    "have been synthesized since 2008 . however , the number of the iron - based compounds reported so far is only about 30 .",
    "importantly , the element - selective feature at the four crystallographic sites allows various kinds of successful chemical doping for inducing superconductivity .",
    "we will have more discussions on these issues in the following sections .      just like cuprate superconductors that possess the essential cuo@xmath0 sheets , all the known fescs necessarily contain fe@xmath0@xmath1 ( `` @xmath2 '' refers to a pnictogen or a chalcogen element ) layers .",
    "the crystal structure of the fe@xmath0@xmath1 layers can be represented by @xmath22-fese [ so - called `` 11 '' phase , see fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ] which itself is a fesc ( @xmath3=8 k at ambient pressure).@xcite ( there was a confusion on the nomenclature in the literatures .",
    "nearly 1:1 stoichiometry actually crystallizes in two polymorphs .",
    "one has a hexagonal nias - type structure , which is more stable than the tetragonal phase .",
    "normally the former is called @xmath23-fese , and the latter is called @xmath22-fese.@xcite ) the @xmath22-fese crystallizes in a layered anti - pbo - type structure with space group @xmath24 .",
    "the fe@xmath0se@xmath0 monolayer consists of fe@xmath0 ( two iron atoms in a unit cell ) square - net sandwiched by two se monolayers . in the language of crystal chemistry ,",
    "the fe atoms are coordinated by four se atoms , and the resulted fese@xmath25 tetrahedra are edge - shared .",
    "in fact , the geometric configuration resembles that of li@xmath0o ( with anti - caf@xmath0-type structure ) . that is the reason why literatures often refer the fe@xmath0@xmath1 layers as to anti - fluorite - type structure .",
    "crystal structure of @xmath22-fese which consists of infinite fe@xmath0se@xmath0 layers .",
    "the structural parameters that are considered to be crucial to the superconducting transition temperature are marked in ( c).,width=264 ]    then , what @xmath2 can form stable fe@xmath0@xmath1 layers that incorporate with other structural blocks to have a high - temperature fesc ? unfortunately , such @xmath2 is limited to se and as so far , although many efforts were made to explore possible superconductivity in an iron compound with other @xmath2 such as sb.@xcite    since the fe@xmath0@xmath1 layers are responsible for superconductivity , the structural details of the fe@xmath26 tetrahedra were considered to be a determinant factor controlling the @xmath3 .",
    "empirically , the relevant structural parameters are ( 1 ) the @xmath27 axis,@xcite ( 2 ) the bond angle of @xmath28fe@xmath29 ( @xmath23),@xcite and ( 3 ) the height of @xmath2 with respect to the fe planes ( @xmath30),@xcite respectively .",
    "the latter two parameters have been widely cited because the maximum @xmath3 in fescs seems to fall at @xmath23=109.5@xmath31 ( corresponding to a right fe@xmath26 tetrahedron ) and @xmath30=1.38  .",
    "theoretical calculations based on spin - fluctuation mechanism were able to elucidate the variations of @xmath3 with increasing @xmath30.@xcite nevertheless , overall @xmath3 does not obey a unique relation to any of these parameters.@xcite perhaps it is simply not suitable to consider the @xmath3 values of _ all _ the fescs , irrespective of doping level , doping site , uniaxial pressures , or isotropic hydrostatic pressures . besides , the two parameters @xmath23 and @xmath30 are not irrelevant .",
    "therefore , the empirical relations have obvious flaws , which should be amended further .    owing to the charge balance for satisfying fe@xmath8 , the 11-type ( tetragonal polymorph ) iron - containing compound must be a chalcogenide .",
    "so , there are only three members : fes , fese and fete in the 11 family .",
    "these simple binary compounds were reported as early as in the 1930s.@xcite among them , fete is the most stable phase , and the crystals can be grown by a melting method.@xcite the @xmath22-fese polymorph is not so stable .",
    "it was reported that annealing at lower temperatures was absolutely necessary to obtain a single phase.@xcite the anti - pbo - type fes is simply metastable , and it can be synthesized only through a soft chemical process in an aqueous solution.@xcite the change in stability seems to be related to the criteria / rule of ionic radius ratio.@xcite the ionic radius ratio between fe@xmath8 and s@xmath32 does not satisfy the tetrahedral coordination well . if the average size of the @xmath2-site anions increases , the @xmath22-phase becomes stabilized .",
    "this is manifested by the fact that it is easy to synthesize the solid solutions of fe(te , se)@xcite and fe(te , s)@xcite .",
    "interestingly , @xmath3 can be enhanced up to about 14 k in both systems .",
    "apparently the 11-type system is the simplest one among all the fescs , however , here we emphasize that the real crystalline status is much more complicated than one expected , primarily because some iron atoms ( in the form of fe@xmath8 ) occupy the interstitial site within the van de waals gap ( @xmath2 bilayers ) .",
    "most importantly , such occupation suppresses superconductivity severely .",
    "it was reported that only 3% of the excess interstitial fe completely destroyed the superconductivity in fe@xmath33se.@xcite      by inserting simple structural unit in between the fe@xmath0@xmath1 layers described above , some basic crystal structures can be derived as shown in fig .",
    "they are classified into the four groups : namely , `` 111 '' , `` 122 '' , `` 122*''@xcite and `` 1111 '' systems , according to the above @xmath21 notation , which is consistent with the common usage .",
    "the inserted units are a bilayer alkali and monolayer ( or partially occupied ) alkaline earth for the 111 and 122 ( 122 * ) structure , respectively . as for the 1111 structure , the @xmath34o@xmath0 ( @xmath35=rare earth ) and @xmath36f@xmath0 ( @xmath37=alkaline earth ) `` block layers ''",
    "are intergrown into the fe@xmath0@xmath1 layers .",
    "table  [ tab : table1 ] lists some representative fescs in the category of the five basic structures .",
    ".[tab : table1]iron - based superconductors with five basic structures ( 11 , 111 , 122 , 122 * and 1111 ) .",
    "a general formula @xmath20 ( see the text ) is used to distinguish the type of elements that occupies / substitutes a certain crystallographic site .",
    "representative chemical doping strategies are included .",
    "`` hp '' denotes the @xmath3 measured under high pressures . [ cols=\"<,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     table  [ tab : table6 ] also indicates that , in some cases , the chemical doping is not successful to generate superconductivity .",
    "one of the reasons is that the doping limit ( or the substitution solubility ) is too small to turn superconductivity on .",
    "the other reason for the absence of superconductivity is that , the doping fails to supply sufficient perturbations to push the system to superconducting ground state , or the dopant itself kills the potential superconductivity .",
    "for example , the isoelectronic doping at @xmath12 site may also supply chemical pressure ( cp ) , but it is not successful to induce superconductivity .",
    "we explain this phenomenon as follows . in a multielement system",
    ", the cp may be `` inhomogeneous '' , as was demonstrated by a systematic study on ( @xmath35,pr)ba@xmath0cu@xmath38o@xmath39-related system.@xcite in iron pnictides , the cp by @xmath12-site doping does not supply enough internal pressure onto the fe@xmath0@xmath1 layers ( although the lattice constants @xmath27 and @xmath40 both decrease ) .",
    "that is the possible reason why the cp by the doping away from the fe@xmath0@xmath1 layers can not produce superconductivity .",
    "since all the known fescs contain fe@xmath0@xmath1 layers , new fescs can be explored by a rational structural design .",
    "the structural building is something like a `` lattice stacking engineering '' ( lse ) .",
    "fortunately , the lse for fescs is relatively simple because it is confined to the stacking along the @xmath40 axis in order to be compatible with the infinite fe@xmath0as@xmath0 layers . in practice",
    ", it is our aim to find a distinct block layers between the fe@xmath0@xmath1 layers , and the designed object must be ultimately synthesized .",
    "here we propose some points that should be taken into considerations for a structural design :    \\1 ) _ laws of crystal chemistry .",
    "_ in general , the law of crystal chemistry@xcite should be referred as a guidance . for example",
    ", the radius ratio rule is particularly effective for an ionic bonding .",
    "\\2 ) _ lattice match . _",
    "perhaps the first condition for a successful lse is that the building block should basically match the essential fe@xmath0@xmath1 lattice . in this respect ,",
    "fe@xmath0@xmath1 layers have very good compatibility because the @xmath27 axis varies from @xmath63.75  to @xmath64.10  .",
    "therefore , many crystallographic layers like caf@xmath0-type , cscl - type , nacl - type , and perovskite - like blocks can be employed as candidates for the building unit .",
    "\\3 ) _ charge balance . _",
    "the next important issue to be considered is charge balance .",
    "empirically , the most stable valence state of fe in pnictides or chalcogenides is 2 + .",
    "this means that the fe@xmath0@xmath41 ( @xmath42 stands for a pnictogen ) unit carries charges + 2@xmath43 such that the intermediate block must bring approximate @xmath44 to neutralize the system .",
    "this is the case that most fescs obey .",
    "the non - charged fe@xmath0@xmath45 ( @xmath46 denotes a chalcogen ) layers in the chalcogenides makes it not so compatible for an ionic interlayer bonding . for the collapsed 122 block , there is interlayer covalent bonding , thus the change of the valence state of @xmath2 should be considered .",
    "\\4 ) _ rule of hsab .",
    "_ the hsab concept can be very useful in designing a multielement compounds . with the classification of the different type of elements in the hsab scheme ,",
    "one may easily find a suitable element for a specific site .",
    "\\5 ) _ self stability .",
    "_ your designed compound must be at least apparently stable by itself .",
    "mixed occupations should be avoid as far as possible .",
    "make sure that `` internal redox reaction '' will not take place in the chemical formula designed .      in this subsection , we present some examples of structural design for fescs .",
    "one should recognize that the proposed structures are not successful unless they are ultimately synthesized . on the other hand , it is very difficult to rule out the possiblity of realization of a certain structure , because there are lots of possible combinations of the constituent elements and , the synthetic methods and conditions are not limited .",
    "we wish the readers would find that some of the examples here could be useful and illuminating .",
    "[ fig8 ] displays some simple structures .",
    "structure ( a ) is derived by adding another fluorite - type layer on the 1111 phase .",
    "the general formula is @xmath47fe@xmath48 .",
    "such thick fluorite - type layers are very common in the cuprate superconductors.@xcite in addition , there is example of the similar building block in eu@xmath38f@xmath49s@xmath0.@xcite so , this structure could be synthesized if one chose the correct compositions and with suitable synthetic techniques ( perhaps high - pressure method should be employed ) .        by adding a cscl - type @xmath50 layers into the 122 phase , the structure of fig .",
    "[ fig8](b ) with a formula of @xmath51fe@xmath52 can be obtained .",
    "one should pay attention to the charge valence for this structure .",
    "[ fig8](c ) shows an example that the @xmath12-site ions are ordered because of the difference in valence states or ionic sizes .",
    "it is actually a superstructure ( along the @xmath40 axis ) of 122 phase .",
    "a possible candidate is klafe@xmath49as@xmath49 .",
    "although our preliminary attempt failed , it could be successful by a low - temperature synthesis which tends to favor an ordered phase .",
    "up to present , the record @xmath3 of fescs appears in 1111 system .",
    "so , a 1111-like structure would be promising for an elevated @xmath3 . if the @xmath15-site ion of the 1111 phase is too large to adopt the fluorite configuration , a distorted 1111 structure would form .",
    "this case is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8](d ) .",
    "the intermediate layer is analogous to the van de waals gap of pbfcl .",
    "so , @xmath12feascl ( @xmath12=ca , cd , pb ) could be candidates of this type structure .",
    "it seems to be true that the fe@xmath0@xmath1-based materials have a @xmath53 limit of @xmath660 k. to explore opportunities of higher @xmath53 in fescs , one may consider modifying the fe@xmath0@xmath1 layers .",
    "[ fig8](e ) shows an example of this attempt .",
    "it contains a thick superconductively - active fe@xmath49as@xmath38 layers .",
    "if such a material came out , higher @xmath3 could be expectable .",
    "it is noted here that the same structure already exists ( e.g. , kcu@xmath49s@xmath38@xcite ) .",
    "the structures shown in fig .  [ fig9 ] are constructed by more building blocks .",
    "the very left structure is an intergrowth of 122 and 1111 .",
    "the resultant chemical formula is @xmath47fe@xmath54 .",
    "a nickel - based material crystallizes in the same structure , which shows superconductivity at 2.2 k.@xcite        in fig .",
    "[ fig9](b ) , a thick @xmath55 block layer , which consists of @xmath56 and @xmath57 layers , is sandwiched into the fe@xmath58 layers .",
    "the general chemical formula is @xmath59fe@xmath60 .",
    "[ fig9](c ) shows a composite structure containing fe@xmath0@xmath1 , perovskite - like @xmath61 and anti - perovskite @xmath62 layers .",
    "the general chemical formula is @xmath63fe@xmath64 .",
    "the last structure we recommend contains a building block bi@xmath65s@xmath25 which was recently found as a new superconductively - active layers.@xcite in this proposed structure , a fluorite - type @xmath57 layers are present .",
    "it can also be viewed as an intergrowth of labis@xmath0o and 1111 structure .",
    "a possible candidate is ( la , sr)@xmath0infese@xmath38o@xmath0 , after considering the lattice match and charge balance .    to be honest , most designed objects are not likely to be successful .",
    "thus the evaluation of the stability of a designed material is very crucial . in this respect ,",
    "first - principles calculations would help under certain circumstances .",
    "we hope to develop this kind of skills soon , in order to make the structural design more rational .",
    "in summary , the crystal chemistry of fescs bears some common characteristic such that a structural design for new fescs is possible .",
    "all the known fescs possess anti - fluorite - type fe@xmath0@xmath1 layers , which are believed to be responsible for superconductivity .",
    "other elements in a certain fesc help to form a three - dimensional lattice , and also assist to tune the superconductivity to an optimal level .",
    "there have been some dozens of fescs discovered so far , classified into nine groups as listed in table  [ tab : table1 ] and table  [ tab : table5 ] .",
    "the superconducting transition temperature @xmath3 scatters from @xmath610 k to @xmath655 k , somewhat depending on the structural parameters such as the bond angle of @xmath28fe@xmath29 and the height of @xmath2 with respect to the fe - plane .",
    "in fact , the maximum @xmath3 also depends on the type of doping . in general",
    ", the doping on the fe@xmath0@xmath1 layers ( especially at the fe site ) inevitably brings disorder effect , which could suppress @xmath3 to some extent .    by employing the hsab concept ,",
    "it is more clear that a specific crystallographic site in a fesc belongs to a certain group of elements .",
    "based on this point , we have summarized the members of iron - containing compounds for the major type of materials ( table  [ tab : table2 ] to table  [ tab : table4 ] ) .",
    "we have also summarized different kinds of chemical doping that may induce superconductivity ( table  [ tab : table6 ] ) .",
    "these knowledges should be useful for selecting a chemical dopant and designing a new structure .",
    "it has been over five years since the breakthrough of fescs in the spring of 2008 .",
    "the number of new fescs discovered seems to decay rapidly with time .",
    "so , maybe we need a rational route in combination with a systematic study .",
    "we have proposed nine structures here .",
    "it is our hope that they could be synthesized at some time in the near future .",

    "<S> the second class of high - temperature superconductors ( htscs ) , iron - based pnictides and chalcogenides , necessarily contain fe@xmath0@xmath1 ( `` @xmath2 '' refers to a pnictogen or a chalcogen element ) layers , just like the first class of htscs which possess the essential cuo@xmath0 sheets . </S>",
    "<S> so far , dozens of iron - based htscs , classified into nine groups , have been discovered . in this article , the crystal - chemistry aspects of the known iron - based superconductors are reviewed and summarized by employing `` hard and soft acids and bases ( hsab ) '' concept . </S>",
    "<S> based on these understandings , we propose an alternative route to exploring new iron - based superconductors via rational structural design . </S>"
