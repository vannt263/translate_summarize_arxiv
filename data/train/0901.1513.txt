    "in qcd , most of the mass of the ground - state light - quark hadrons , e.g. , @xmath1 of the @xmath2 meson mass , is understood to be generated dynamically by the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in the complex vacuum , so it is natural to think that by  cleansing \" the vacuum , the masses could disappear as the broken symmetry is restored . based on this general consideration , a prediction was made in 1991 that the masses of light - quark hadrons would drop proportionally to some power of the quark condensate at high temperature and density  @xcite .",
    "this in - medium property of hadrons is referred to in the literature as  brown - rho ( br ) scaling . \"",
    "it was thought that the  unbreaking \" of the symmetry , or equivalently the  shedding \" of the mass , can be done by heating the hadronic system to a high temperature ( and/or by compressing the matter to a high density ) . to unravel the vacuum change induced specifically by temperature",
    ", efforts have been made to look at the properties of the vector mesons , i.e.  @xmath2 and @xmath3 , in heavy ion collisions where the temperature could be raised to hundreds of mev at which chiral restoration is predicted by qcd to take place .",
    "it was thought that the properties of the @xmath2 ( and @xmath3 ) meson inside strongly interacting media could be effectively probed with dilepton pairs , which couple to the vector mesons and provide , free of final state interactions , a snap - shot of the vector meson propagating in the medium .",
    "due to the mass shedding in a hot medium , one naturally expected to observe a downward shift of the invariant mass of the vector meson in the spectral functions .",
    "the measurement of dileptons , which is the classical tool for discovering new resonances in particle physics , is used to see how the known @xmath2 resonance in free space moves in a hot medium .",
    "several such experiments have been performed recently . for reasons which will become clear below",
    ", we will focus specifically on the na60  @xcite experiment , although our discussion applies to other dilepton measurements such as ceres , etc .",
    "what came out of the experiments so far performed is that no vector mesons affected by the vacuum change due to temperature and density as predicted by br scaling are unequivocally  seen \" by the dileptons .    in this paper , using a set of arguments , some established and some conjectural , based on the structure of hidden local symmetry in low - energy hadronic interactions , we develop the scenario that dileptons emitted from the vector mesons whose properties are br - scaled are strongly , if not completely , suppressed and the dileptons observed in heavy - ion experiments reflect on - shell behavior of the vector mesons only modified by the mundane nuclear many - body interactions  @xcite but not by the change of the vacuum due to temperature and/or density .",
    "this means that if our scenario is correct , _ the br - scaled vector mesons are almost , if not entirely ,  invisible \" to the virtual photon . _ as briefly commented in the conclusion section , a similar consideration  with a small variation  could apply to dileptons produced in such cold dense environments as expected to be provided at the future fair / gsi facility .",
    "we propose as a promising tool to unravel the chiral symmetry structure of hadronic matter a holographic hidden local symmetry framework in which the holographic dimension allows , with a single 5d hidden local symmetry action , a unified description in medium of both mesonic and baryonic excitations treated on the same footing .",
    "baryons emerge here as coherent states of pions and vector mesons which define the ground state or the modified  vacuum \" on which fluctuating vector mesons undergo br scaling in hot and/or dense medium",
    ". a consistent treatment along this line , yet to be made , could lead to a totally different picture from that currently accepted of hot and dense baryonic matter .",
    "the key proposition in our work is that in a certain range of temperature ( and density  @xcite ) to be specified below between the critical @xmath4 at which a chiral transition takes place and what we will call  flash temperature \" @xmath5 , _ all _ hadron interactions become weak , as a consequence of which vector - meson coupling to the virtual photon @xmath6 is suppressed .",
    "this is associated , in a manner to be precisely specified below , with the `` vector manifestation '' ( vm ) phenomenon in hidden local symmetry ( hls ) developed by harada and yamawaki  @xcite .",
    "we first briefly summarize the predictions of hls as one approaches @xmath4 from below that is relevant to the problem at hand and then introduce as clearly as possible the notion of  hadronic freedom \" that plays the principal role in our discussions .",
    "we start with a brief sketch of the 5 dimensional hidden local symmetry action that presumably encodes all low - energy hadron dynamics involving integer spin ( 0 , 1 ) and half - integer ( 1/2 , 3/2 , ... ) spin excitations treated on the same footing",
    ". one can arrive at an action of the same structure both bottom - up and top - down .",
    "the well - established theory for strong interactions at low energy is chiral perturbation theory for the ( pseudo- ) nambu - goldstone pions @xmath7 , the effective lagrangian of which has the form _",
    "eff=(_u^u^)+[chil ] where the ellipsis stands for higher derivative and quark mass terms . at energies",
    "much less than the vector - meson excitation @xmath8 mev , when treated in a systematic expansion , this represents qcd  @xcite .",
    "the validity of this theory is however highly limited to low energy , so if one wants to study the vector mesons whose masses are much higher than that of the pion , chiral perturbation theory with pions alone loses its power . the question is how to extend the model - independent approach to higher - energy scale .",
    "we will be particularly concerned with the situation where the vector - meson mass decreases from its free - space mass @xmath9 to one near the pion mass which is zero in the chiral limit  @xcite . in our approach , this occurs at the chiral phase transition .",
    "this means that we will be dealing with the possibility  which will be realized in our model  that the vector meson mass becomes comparable to the pion mass and hence both the vector meson and the pion need to be treated on the same footing .",
    "this can be most readily done if one exploits local gauge invariance  @xcite .",
    "seen from the holographic point of view , this is natural as we will argue below .",
    "the astute observation for our development is that the chiral field  @xcite u = e^g / h where @xmath10 denotes the nambu - goldstone ( ng ) bosons associated with the spontaneous breaking of chiral @xmath11 symmetry to @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 , has a redundancy when written in terms of the coordinates for the l and r symmetries , u = e^=_l^_r [ u]with @xmath15 \\ .",
    "\\label{def : xilr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the redundancy can be elevated to a local gauge invariance by noting that the chiral lagrangian built with @xmath16 is invariant under the local transformation _",
    "l , rh(x)_l , r with @xmath17 and introducing a gauge field @xmath18 that transforms _",
    "h(x)(_-ig_)h^(x ) .",
    "the field @xmath19 represents the redundancy in the low - energy theory .",
    "now when written in the lowest order in derivatives in terms of the covariant derivatives @xmath20 , the resulting local gauge invariant lagrangian @xmath21 $ ] is identical to the chiral lagrangian ( [ chil ] ) when gauge fixed to unitary gauge corresponding to @xmath22 .",
    "one says that @xmath23 is  gauge - equivalent \" to @xmath24 . to elevate the energy scale from that of the current algebra scale to that of the vector mesons ,",
    "one adds the kinetic energy term to make the field propagate , _",
    "hls = l^-(_^ ) + [ hls ] the @xmath19 can be identified with the nambu - goldstone ( ng ) scalars that emerge from the spontaneous breaking of the @xmath12 symmetry and that are higgsed to give masses to the vector mesons .",
    "this is hidden local symmetry theory proposed in @xcite and later quantized  @xcite that we shall refer to as hls@xmath25 .    for our development , it is important that the notion of hidden local symmetry can be extended to an infinite number of hidden local fields .",
    "we suggest that hls@xmath25 is a truncated version of a hidden local symmetry theory with an infinite tower of vector fields . as such",
    ", hls@xmath25 can be viewed as a realistic model of qcd .",
    "it is clear from the construction of hls@xmath25 that there is nothing that prevents adding an infinite number of redundancies and construct a theory with an infinite number of gauge fields .",
    "there is of course the problem of non - uniqueness since the construction would lead to a large number of possibilities .",
    "one such construction which resembles the nearest neighbor interaction in condensed matter physics is the construction based on  theory - space locality \"  @xcite on lattice which in the continuum limit leads to a five - dimensional ( 5d ) yang - mills action defined in a curved space  @xcite s_ym = d^4x dz ( f_abf^ab ) + [ 5dym ] with @xmath26 .",
    "the ellipsis stands for higher derivative terms .",
    "implemented with the chern - simons action @xmath27 that encodes anomalies , this may be considered as a  dimensionally deconstructed \" qcd  @xcite emerging bottom - up from the current algebra lagrangian .",
    "note that this action contains not only the goldstone bosons and spin-1 excitations but also baryons as instantons , i.e. , coherent states of the goldstone boson and vector mesons , all on the same footing .",
    "what is most intriguing is that a 5d ym action plus the chern - simons identical in form to the action ( [ 5dym ] ) arises also top - down from string theory .",
    "indeed an action of the form ( [ 5dym ] ) was recently constructed by sakai and sugimoto  @xcite using d4/d8-d@xmath28 branes valid in the limit that @xmath29 , @xmath30 and in the chiral limit .",
    "now reduced to four dimensions ( 4d ) by the usual kaluza - klein procedure , the action can be phrased in terms of an infinite tower of vector and axial vector mesons describing @xmath31 chiral symmetry which may be rewritten in a local gauge invariant form .",
    "we shall refer to the infinite - tower local symmetry theory as hls@xmath32 .",
    "various approximations enter in arriving at the 5d action such as for instance the  probe approximation \" @xmath33 .",
    "but what is robust and generic is that low - energy hadron dynamics can be encapsulated in a hidden local symmetric action with an infinite tower of gauge fields .",
    "notice however that eq.([5dym ] ) bottom - up is defined in the gauge sector whereas top - down is in the gravity sector .",
    "generating a gauge invariant theory from a non - gauge theory as in the bottom - up approach does not lead to a unique theory and hence can be totally arbitrary unless constraints are imposed .",
    "on the other hand , the top - down approach is well - defined in the given limit but its uv completion is to a certain part of string theory which may have nothing to do with qcd .",
    "furthermore , while the problem we are interested in involves properties that are intricately locked to the chiral order parameter , i.e. , quark condensate , which changes with temperature and density , the large @xmath34 and @xmath35 limits suppress the temperature and/or density dependence in the physical variables .",
    "one would have to calculate terms higher order in @xmath36 .",
    "but that would require calculating string loop corrections in the gravity sector which is at present infeasible .",
    "for this reason , we are unable to look at vector meson masses as temperature increases since in the large @xmath34 limit , the masses do not move .",
    "nonetheless , as we will see below , the infinite tower structure has an extremely important implication on vector dominance in hadron electromagnetic form factors and this feature is expected to play a crucial role in understanding dilepton production process in heavy ion collisions .",
    "let us , for the sake of arguments , imagine that we have an hls@xmath32 in which all pertinent @xmath36 and @xmath37 corrections can be included and which provides a realistic description of low - energy qcd .",
    "assume further that as temperature is increased , only the lowest vector meson @xmath38 drops in mass while the higher lying vector mesons remain more or less unmodified .",
    "this is most likely very difficult to confirm , but it is plausible . in this case",
    ", we could imagine formally integrating out _ all _ vector mesons except @xmath39 and write the resulting action as a suitable power series in terms of covariant derivatives of the @xmath39 field to get a hidden local symmetric effective action . how to do this consistently has been proposed by harada , matsuzaki and yamawaki  @xcite .",
    "what results would be identical in form to the hls@xmath25 theory of @xcite .",
    "this would justify hls@xmath25 as a potentially realistic model for low - energy dynamics in high temperature , particularly if the @xmath39 mass does come down to that comparable to the pion mass which we will argue is what happens at high temperature in heavy ion collisions . as suggested in @xcite ,",
    "the local gauge symmetry plays a crucial role in treating this situation .      in free space at @xmath40 , the vector meson mass @xmath41 can be taken to be very heavy compared to the pion mass , i.e. , @xmath42 , particularly in the chiral limit . in this case",
    ", there are various different ways of introducing vector mesons  with or without local gauge symmetry  which are all equivalent at tree order .",
    "the hidden local symmetry approach hls@xmath25 on the contrary takes the vector meson mass to be of the same order as the pion mass , that is , in the chiral power counting , m_~m_~o ( p ) which is equivalent to taking the gauge coupling @xmath43 going as g~o ( p ) . in the framework",
    "adopted here where the @xmath2 mass does decrease , it is very likely that this power counting holds , rendering chiral perturbation expansion justified in the vicinity of the chiral transition point @xmath4 where the vector meson mass goes to zero .",
    "but it is not obvious why it should hold in free space where @xmath44 is not of order 1 .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , however , it does turn out that chiral perturbation calculation including the vector meson works fairly well in free space as shown in @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the chiral perturbation which is justified in large @xmath34 describes the realistic @xmath45 world as an extrapolation .",
    "given the systematic counting rule , one can then develop chiral perturbation .",
    "this was done to one - loop order  @xcite . in the parameter space of @xmath43 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( quark masses",
    "should of course be additional parameters if we go beyond the chiral limit . ) , the renormalization group analysis of hls@xmath25 theory to one loop order reveals a variety of fixed points .",
    "this reflects the well - known non - uniqueness of gauge symmetric theories constructed from non - gauge theories  @xcite : local gauge symmetric theories can flow , unconstrained , to a variety of different fixed points . in order to identify the flow to qcd among them , harada and yamawaki match",
    " la wilson the vector and axial - vector correlators of hls@xmath25 to those of qcd at a matching scale @xmath48 .",
    "the matching then determines the hls@xmath25 parameters @xmath49 in terms of the qcd variables , namely , @xmath50 , @xmath34 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 etc .",
    "that figure in the ope of the correlators .",
    "now when one imposes the condition that at the chiral phase transition characterized by @xmath53 , the vector correlator @xmath54 equal the axial - vector correlator @xmath55  which is what one expects in qcd , one can identify the fixed point ( denoted by bar ) that corresponds to qcd , i.e. , ( |g ,    point  @xcite .",
    "although this fixed point is derived at one - loop order , it can be seen with a little effort that it is valid to all orders .",
    "the parametric pion decay constant @xmath46 does not figure in the fixed point ( [ vm ] ) because there is nothing special about the flow of @xmath46 , so at the fixed point , it does not have any special role as it remains non - vanishing .",
    "however the on - shell ( physical ) pion decay constant @xmath56 which receives loop corrections @xmath57 below the on - shell @xmath2 mass , f_=f_+ should go to zero at @xmath4 because it must track the quark condensate .",
    "note that this must occur by cancelation .",
    "what is important is that as @xmath58 goes to @xmath4  @xcite ( and as density @xmath59 goes to the critical density @xmath60  @xcite ) , the hadronic matter flows to the vm fixed point ( [ vm ] ) , g^*&~ & |qq^*0 , + ( a^*-1)&~ & |qq^*^20 .",
    "here and in what follows the asterisk stands for temperature ( or density ) dependence .",
    "this means that the parameters of the lagrangian have an intrinsic dependence on temperature locked to the property of the condensate @xmath51 .",
    "this has the key consequence that the _ parametric mass _ of the vector meson very near the vm fixed point behaves as  @xcite ^2=a^*f^*_^2 ^*g^*^2~|qq^*^2,[para - mass ] so will go to zero .",
    "this is the _ statement of br scaling _ sharpened by hls@xmath25 .",
    "now what about the physical ( or pole ) mass of the vector meson @xmath61 in medium ?",
    "for this one has to compute thermal loop terms which will necessarily involve the gauge coupling , so ^2=a^ * g^*^2 f^*_^2 + g^*^2 b [ pole - mass ] where b is a smooth function of temperature given by thermal loop corrections . as @xmath62",
    ", both terms go to zero as @xmath63 , so that br scaling should still hold for the physical mass .",
    "it is however to be noted that far away from the vm fixed point , there is nothing that suggests that the physical mass must be dropping according to br scaling .",
    "in fact , it can go up or down or even remain more or less unchanged depending on the thermal loop corrections involving complicated many - body nuclear dynamics . in",
    "order to  see \" br scaling in terms of hls@xmath25 in temperatures away from the vm fixed point , therefore , one needs to bring in baryons via topology in addition to the bosonic degrees of freedom that are present explicitly .",
    "such a calculation remains to be done .",
    "the same consideration holds in cold dense matter as discussed in the conclusion section .      in the close vicinity of the vm fixed point , the interactions are likely to be weak since the gauge coupling goes to zero .",
    "the main reason for this is that in hls@xmath25 , the strongest interaction at low energy which is in the p - wave channel , i.e. , the @xmath2 channel , is suppressed by the vanishing @xmath43 .",
    "further , the s - wave @xmath64 interactions are governed by derivative interactions ( in the chiral limit ) , so should be weak at low energy",
    ". there may be other degrees of freedom not explicitly taken into account in hls@xmath25  such as quasiquarks or possible scalars  but the quasiquark interactions mediated by the vector mesons are also suppressed by the gauge coupling and quasiquark - pion interactions are derivative - coupled , so suppressed by the power counting .",
    "thus it seems reasonable to take _ all _ hadronic interactions to be weak near the vm fixed point .",
    "now how far down in temperature can one ignore the interactions ?",
    "in principle , the intrinsic temperature dependence will be running as temperature is varied .",
    "for instance , the gauge coupling in the chiral limit will scale up from zero at @xmath4 to near its free space value at some temperature which we shall call  flash temperature \" @xmath65 .",
    "the flash temperature @xmath66 can be defined following the work of shuryak and brown  @xcite of the star data  @xcite .",
    "shuryak and brown determined the flash temperature to be the temperature at which the @xmath2 was 90% on - shell , namely , when the @xmath2 mass is 700 mev .",
    "whereas the flash temperature is independent of the centrality , this is not the case for the freezeout temperature @xmath67 .",
    "in fact @xmath67 decreases as the centrality increases .",
    "thus , given @xmath68 for peripheral collisions , @xmath69 for central collisions and during the time the system is between these two temperatures the pions from @xmath2 and @xmath70 decay will be rescattered as it is no longer possible from their detection to work backward to the parent vector mesons .",
    "it is possible to pin down the numerical value of the flash temperature from lattice calculations .",
    "we shall extract this quantity from miller s lattice calculation  @xcite which we analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the result is t_f120  mev .",
    "how this result comes about can be summarized as follows .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , in miller s lattice calculation of the gluon condensate , the soft glue starts to melt at @xmath71 mev .",
    "the melting of the soft glue , which breaks scale invariance as well as chiral invariance @xmath72 and is responsible for brown - rho scaling , is completed by @xmath4 at which the particles have gone massless according to the vm .",
    "one can see that the gluon condensate at @xmath73 is as high as that at @xmath74 .",
    "this represents the hard glue ( or  epoxy \" ) which breaks scale invariance @xmath75 but has no effect on the hadron mass .",
    "we see that the melting of the soft glue is roughly linear , implying that the meson masses drop linearly with temperature .",
    "@xcite    how the ( bare ) parameters of the lagrangian scale _ intrinsically _ in temperature ( and/or density ) is not quantitatively known except in the very close vicinity of the vm fixed point . in the absence of guidance , theoretical or experimental , we take , as the first step , the simplest scenario which is to ignore interactions _",
    "entirely _ between the chiral restoration point @xmath4 and the flash point @xmath65 and let the relevant massless degrees of freedom coming down from above @xmath4  @xcite flow without interactions as the system cools to @xmath65 .",
    "we then assume that hadrons go ( nearly free - space ) on - shell at @xmath65 recovering their ( nearly ) full interaction strength and free - space mass .",
    "corrections due to increasing temperature as one approaches @xmath65  involving both the intrinsic dependence and the thermal loops ",
    "need of course to be computed at the next stage of refinement .",
    "this region between @xmath4 and @xmath65 will be dubbed ",
    "hadronic freedom regime . \"",
    "@xcite we must admit that the notion of hadronic freedom is a strong assumption which needs to be confirmed . at present , there are no theoretical tools to check this notion in unambiguous ways .",
    "as pointed out below , it could be validated or refuted by experiments .",
    "all we can say at the moment is that while there are indirect evidences for it , there are no  smoking gun \" evidences against the notion of hadronic freedom either .",
    "what we propose to do in this article is to _ posit _ the hadronic freedom and then see how far we can go in confronting nature .",
    "we will then present our interpretation of its consequence on dileptons in heavy ion collisions .",
    "our scenario , which is drastically different from the conventional scenario , has the merit of providing a possible , albeit indirect , link between the manifestation of br scaling in low - energy nuclear structure physics ",
    "some of which will be mentioned in the conclusion section  and possibly direct manifestation or precursor effects in heavy ion processes .      in considering dileptons in heavy ion collisions",
    ", it is customarily assumed that vector dominance holds in medium at _ all _ temperatures and densities . in hls@xmath25",
    ", vector dominance does hold in free space but not in hot / dense medium .",
    "in fact , vector dominance is violated at @xmath76 , with a drastic effect on dileptons in hot / dense medium .",
    "we briefly review how this comes about and then discuss what happens in the presence of the infinite tower of vector mesons figuring in holographic qcd that follows from gravity / gauge duality in string theory .",
    "we believe that the infinite tower structure encoded in the holographic direction which treats both mesons ( spin 0 and 1 ) and baryons on the same footing , when @xmath36 corrections are suitably handled , could ultimately clarify the behavior of hadrons in high temperature and/or density .",
    "in hls@xmath25 theory , the photon couples to the charged pion as in fig.[vd1 ] : ( a ) direct @xmath77 with the coefficient @xmath78 and ( b ) @xmath77 mediated by @xmath2-meson exchange with the coefficient @xmath79 . it turns out that @xmath80 in medium - free ( @xmath81 ) space which gives the ksfr relation correctly .",
    "this value completely suppresses the direct photon coupling fig.[vd1](a ) , giving full strength to fig.[vd1](b ) .",
    "this is the famous lowest vector - meason dominance ( lvd for short ) of the pion form factor , i.e. @xmath2-meson dominance in sakurai s sense  @xcite .",
    "note however that @xmath80 is not on the trajectories of the renormalization group equation for @xmath82 , so it is in some sense an accident  @xcite .",
    "thus unsurprisingly , this lvd is violated  in fact `` maximally ''  as @xmath83 : as @xmath82 approaches 1 , the direct coupling enters with the same strength as the vector exchange term  @xcite .",
    "this violation of lvd is argued below to be largely , if not wholly , responsible for the suppression of dileptons in the hadronic freedom regime .",

    "we will first treat the cases where our approach can make clear statements and then present what can be said about the dileptons in heavy ion collisions that have been controversial in the literature such as the na60 data etc .      as a case where the notion of the hadronic freedom makes a simple prediction , we recall how the star @xmath105 ratio ( star ratio for short )  @xcite can be understood .    in a recent experiment ,",
    "star collaboration has reconstructed the @xmath2-mesons from the two - pion decay products in the au + au peripheral collisions at @xmath106 gev .",
    "the ratio found was |_star=0.1690.003 ( stat)0.037 ( syst),[stardata ] almost as large as the @xmath107 in proton - proton scattering .",
    "the near equality of these ratios was not expected , in that the @xmath2 meson width @xmath108 mev in free space is the strongest meson re - scattering that one has .",
    "for instance , at sps one needs about 10 generations in order to get the dileptons  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , if one assumes equilibrium at the freezeout , then the ratio is expected to come to several orders of magnitude smaller , say , @xmath109  @xcite",
    ".    there may be a variety of explanations for this observation , some of which are along the standard line of thought from which our scenario appears to depart drastically .",
    "what distinguishes the result that follows from the hadronic freedom  which turns out to come out consistent with the experiment ( [ stardata ] )  is that the mechanism is extremely simple if one assumes that the @xmath110 s are reconstructed at the flash point at which the @xmath2 meson emerges from the hadronic freedom regime going through only one generation from @xmath4 .",
    "we should however stress that no claim is made here that the proposed mechanism is either unique or the only viable explanation .",
    "it is just that our scenario has the merit to be simple and consistent within the proposed framework anchored on the hadronic freedom and the vector manifestation of hls@xmath25 .",
    "this matter was discussed in @xcite to which we refer for details . here",
    "we review it briefly for the sake of making our arguments self - contained .",
    "the key point in our scenario is that because of the decreased width due to the hadronic freedom , the @xmath2 meson is assumed to go through _ only one generation _ before it freezes out at the flash point in the peripheral collisions in star .",
    "there will be no equilibrium at the end of the first generation .",
    "as the plasma decreases in temperature towards @xmath4 from above , lattice gauge calculations@xcite show a set of 32 @xmath111 degenerate vibrations@xcite : scalar , pseudoscalar , vector and axial vector , i.e. , the set of degrees of freedom that figure in weinberg s mended symmetry at the chiral transition point  @xcite .",
    "the widths become large as @xmath83 from above .",
    "@xcite we connect these with the @xmath111 group of mesons , including the @xmath2 of the hls@xmath25 vector manifestation , becoming massless ( except for a small spin - spin interaction effect ) as @xmath58 moves up to @xmath4 from below . aside from the background @xmath112 and @xmath3 , these 32 mesons decay as they go on shell to give 65 pions ( three of them being already present in the 32 @xmath111 mesons )  @xcite .",
    "thus , taking the 22 @xmath113 mesons and subtracting 3 , which are traced back to the vertex inside the plasma where the @xmath110 was formed , one has @xmath114 in agreement with the experiment . as noted ,",
    "this number is about the same as the @xmath105 ratio measured in @xmath115 scattering .",
    "however , the vacuum @xmath2 has a width of @xmath116 mev so its lifetime is only @xmath117 fm / c and in proceeding from @xmath4 to the flash point where the @xmath2 goes on shell , which we shall find to be at @xmath118 mev , were the interactions unsuppressed , there would be several generations of @xmath119 , whereas our estimates show that there are none ; the @xmath2 s move from @xmath4 to @xmath66 without interaction . thus had the @xmath2 possessed its on - shell mass and width with @xmath120 five generations as in the standard scenario , the @xmath121 ratio would be closer to the much smaller equilibrium value .",
    "there are certain consequences of the hadronic freedom that are more prominent in dense matter than in hot matter .",
    "since dilepton experiments involve density in addition to high temperature , some of them need to be explained .",
    "one of the most important applications of the notion of the hadronic freedom is to the role of kaon condensation in compact stars .",
    "a recent publication addresses this matter in conjunction with black - hole formation and a possible cosmological consequence  @xcite .    while the phase structure of dense matter is not well understood , the first important phase change that can take place in dense matter above the nuclear matter density @xmath122 and that can be treated reliably thanks to the vm is kaon condensation at a density @xmath123 .",
    "this phase transition is considered to be responsible for the ultimate fate of compact stars , e.g. , the formation of stable neutron stars or collapse into black holes  @xcite .",
    "it takes place because of the decrease of the kaon mass and the increase of the electron chemical potential at increasing matter density : matter density drives the mass of the kaon downwards and the electron chemical potential upwards so that they cross in the hadronic freedom region between @xmath60 and the flash chemical potential @xmath124 . the dropping gauge coupling  @xcite and the rapid approach to @xmath125 in dense medium  @xcite",
    "enable one to reliably calculate the mass of the kaon as a function of density in the vicinity of the vm fixed point and hence determine the critical density .",
    "this phenomenon has a far - reaching consequence on the physics of compact stars .",
    "_ what is important for our problem at hand is that when matter density is present , the vector dominance is more rapidly violated than in temperature alone_. this is highly relevant in our picture in na60 .",
    "we now apply the hadronic freedom picture to dileptons produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions . our conclusion will be that if the hadronic freedom picture is correct , then the dileptons produced from the @xmath2 mesons populating the interval between @xmath4 and @xmath65 are strongly suppressed and hence the measured dileptons do not provide a direct snapshot of the properties of the vector mesons that are br - scaled .",
    "consider first the thermal @xmath2 spectral function in hls@xmath25 theory in the close vicinity of the vm fixed point approached from below .",
    "we shall show that depending upon whether the @xmath2 width is vanishing or non - vanishing , one gets a completely different result for the spectral function @xmath126 .",
    "suppose that we have a renormalized @xmath2 propagator in the form @xmath127 with @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the mass parameter with intrinsic temperature dependence in the hls@xmath25 lagrangian given by ( [ para - mass ] ) , @xmath130 is the real part of the self - energy and @xmath131 is the width coming from the imaginary part of the self - energy .",
    "the asterisk stands for an in - medium quantity . to make the discussion more general than hls@xmath25",
    ", we will suppose that the self - energy term could contain contributions from degrees of freedom other than just @xmath2 and @xmath10 .",
    "for instance , @xmath131 could in principle contain many - body effects such as collisional width , involving baryonic excitations .",
    "the spectral function relevant for the dilepton spectrum at a fixed @xmath58 ( including @xmath132 ) is expressed by the imaginary part of the vector current correlator as @xmath133 \\   \\label{im gv}\\ ] ] where @xmath134 is the @xmath2 decay constant which in general will have an imaginary part .",
    "ignoring the imaginary part , we have @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the in - medium decay constant of the longitudinal component of @xmath2 ( see eq.([def : xilr ] ) ) .",
    "note that @xmath137 includes both elementary hadronic and thermal loop corrections .",
    "it is related to the in - medium @xmath2-@xmath86 coupling @xmath138 as @xmath139    setting @xmath140 at the in - medium pole position , we get for the spectral function @xmath141 in terms of the leptonic decay width which is given by @xmath142 we have @xmath143 where we have neglected certain numerical factors such as @xmath144 .",
    "this shows that the behavior of the spectral function depends on the properties of both the leptonic and hadronic widths .",
    "let us see what happens when one approaches the chiral transition point at which @xmath145 .",
    "for this , we look at eq .",
    "( [ i m gv 2 ] ) : ( s = m_^^2 ) where we have used @xmath146 near the fixed point .",
    "we need to know ( a ) how @xmath147 and @xmath136 approach the fixed point and ( b ) more crucially the behavior near the fixed point of the hadronic width @xmath131 . in hls@xmath25",
    ", it is established that @xmath148 but how @xmath149 ( or @xmath150 ) behaves in terms of the quark condensate is not known .",
    "it is because it goes to zero at the fixed point by the cancelation between the intrinsic term @xmath151 and thermal loop corrections , both of which are not zero .",
    "suppose for the sake of argument that the in - medium pion decay constant goes as @xmath152 .",
    "then the behavior of the spectral function will be entirely dependent on whether the hadronic width vanishes or not .",
    "if it is non - vanishing , then the spectral function will go to zero .",
    "however if it vanishes , how it vanishes will matter .",
    "within hls@xmath25 , we expect @xmath153 . in this case",
    "the spectral function will be singular",
    ". this would be the case if leptons decoupled from the @xmath2 _ after _ hadrons ( e.g. , pions ) did .",
    "if this case holds , then the quantitative estimate made on the suppression factor discussed in section [ seen ] would have to be taken with caution .",
    "in reality , the situation is not at all clear .",
    "first of all , there is the threshold mass required by the lepton mass ( as in na60 ) which prevents the approach to the fixed point .",
    "furthermore there can be several elements or mechanisms that are not encoded in hls@xmath25 at the perturbative level which can intervene to modify the picture .",
    "we have already mentioned , among other things , the possible role of the infinite tower implied by holographic dual qcd , the solitonic degrees of freedom ( e.g. , collisional broadening ) , hagedorn excitations etc .",
    "this means that we can not simply take the hls@xmath25 result mentioned above at its face value .",
    "now given our ignorance of the variety of mechanisms that could possibly invalidate the simple hls@xmath25 prediction , we choose to accept the experimental indication , described in section [ seen ] , that _ no _ dileptons are observed from the @xmath2 mesons living in the temperature interval between @xmath4 and @xmath65 that we are identifying with hadronic freedom .",
    "it would of course be extremely interesting if future experiments did exhibit a sharp peak at a low dilepton invariant mass .",
    "it would provide an evidence for the validity of the simplest picture of hls@xmath25 and of the vector manifestation fixed point .",
    "it would however falsify the role of the assumed hadronic freedom on the strong suppression of the dilepton coupling to the vector mesons in the given temperature ( and density ) range .",
    "although similar arguments apply to other dilepton experiments ( such as ceres , phenix etc . ) , we will focus here on the conditions that are met in na60 .",
    "there are several sources in na60 for the dimuon suppression in the hadronic free region in temperature from @xmath4 to @xmath66 as well as in density from @xmath60 to @xmath124 . in this region , the @xmath2 meson decay to a lepton pair is suppressed both in the em sector and in the hadronic sector .",
    "notable among the possible suppression mechanisms are :    1 .",
    "* vd violation * : in the em sector , the maximal violation of vd discussed above reduces the @xmath154 decay rate by a factor of 4 .",
    "this reduction sets in more quickly in the presence of baryonic matter as mentioned in section iiic .",
    "* wave function suppression : * at the vm fixed point , the transverse @xmath2 decouples from the vector current as the gauge coupling @xmath43 goes to zero .",
    "if we were to consider in terms of the quasiquark picture , this would imply , in the hadronic sector , the suppression of the bound zero - mass quasiquark - quasiantiquark wave function of the @xmath2 meson , @xmath155 .",
    "this effect is encoded in hls@xmath25 theory by the suppression of the @xmath156 coupling which gives a factor of @xmath157 reduction .",
    "* phase space suppression : * because of the dropping gauge coupling @xmath43 , @xmath158 and the dimuon threshold mass of 210 mev , the phase space for the decay is suppressed by a factor @xmath157 .",
    "this effect is not entirely orthogonal to the wave function suppression effect as explained below",
    ".    these mechanisms will give a suppression factor relative to the standard picture  @xcite of the dileptons of @xmath159 in the hadronic freedom regime where the br scaling effect is to be operative in hls@xmath25 theory .",
    "we elaborate on these points .",
    "the violation of vd comes about by @xmath160 going to 1 in hot / dense medium . although one should perform the renormalization group calculation to find @xmath160 in terms of temperature as well as density",
    " such a calculation has not been done yet , there is a strong indication that @xmath160 goes rapidly from 2 to 1 in hot / dense medium .",
    "one can see in the work of shuryak and brown  @xcite that this drop is sudden , at @xmath71 mev , with increasing @xmath58 . in the presence of density",
    ", it should drop even faster as argued in section iiic .",
    "therefore , we assign @xmath161 to the region from @xmath118 mev to @xmath162 mev .",
    "this gives the suppression factor of about 4 .",
    "moreover , there will be dileptons coming from the direct @xmath163 coupling that have nothing to do with the in - medium properties of the @xmath2 meson .",
    "these should contribute a roughly constant background to the total dilepton yield .",
    "note that the range of @xmath2-meson energies is 0 to 700 mev , so that we are discussing @xmath2-mesons with energy below the on - shell @xmath2-mass of 770 mev .",
    "therefore , we should look to the low mass part of the spectrum .",
    "there will be further hindrance for the dileptons which come through the @xmath2 meson on the hadronic side , because the dileptons are similar to a photon , to the extent that their masses are small compared with their invariant energy , so that there is an approximate factor @xmath164 ( where @xmath165 is the @xmath2 wavefunction ) of the probability of the off - shell @xmath2 meson being at its origin .",
    "this gives rise roughly to a factor of 2 reduction .",
    "this can be seen in hls@xmath25 as follows : the photon couples to the @xmath2 with the coupling @xmath166 which goes to zero when the vm is approached , i.e. , @xmath62 .",
    "the vanishing of the photon coupling manifested in the vanishing gauge coupling represents the vanishing of the @xmath2 wave function at the origin , @xmath167 , when the mass goes to zero .",
    "what is relevant to us is the pion - loop medium correction @xmath168 to the @xmath156 coupling @xmath169 ~ with @xmath170 .",
    "the density dependence of @xmath168 has not yet been computed in hls@xmath25 but its temperature dependence has been computed perturbatively in ref .",
    "@xcite : ( t = t_f ) & & -0.2 , + ( t = t_c ) & & -0.4 [ perturbative ] for @xmath171 mev and @xmath172 mev .",
    "this increases the reduction factor by an additional factor @xmath173 .",
    "given that the density effect is not included in the loop correction , it seems reasonable to take the resulting reduction factor to be @xmath174 .",
    "we have to stress here that the estimates ( [ perturbative ] ) were made in perturbation theory with hls@xmath25 lagrangian with @xmath2 and @xmath10 only , so may not be reliable in the vicinity of the phase transition point . there may be non - perturbative effects which require going beyond the chiral perturbative approach to hls theory .",
    "furthermore , the drastically simplified hls structure with the ground state vector mesons only may be inadequate in describing dynamics near the phase transition . as mentioned above , such degrees of freedom as the infinite tower of vector mesons encoded in holographic qcd , baryonic excitations via solitons ( i.e. , skyrmion or instanton ) etc .",
    "might play a crucial role .",
    "one can arrive at a similar reduction factor from the phase space consideration which seems to have a partial overlap with the wave function suppression considered above . integrating the contribution from potentially br - scaling @xmath2 mesons down from @xmath4 , we first find that the integral begins at @xmath175 mev , because the muon masses must be furnished , and then continues down to the nearly on - shell @xmath2 mass of @xmath176 mev , the remaining 10% to put the @xmath2 completely on shell coming from the kinetic energy  @xcite .",
    "however , in our scenario , the @xmath2 masses are essentially zero  @xcite at just above @xmath4 @xcite behaving as if they have a quark substructure of two massless quarks , coupled to a massless @xmath2 . in the integral going down from @xmath4 the integrand , beginning from zero at @xmath177 , would be expected to increase as the @xmath2 goes back towards the value of the on - shell @xmath2 because of the effect on @xmath178 from the increasing correlations as the @xmath2 goes on shell .",
    "it seems reasonable to approximate the entire effect of @xmath178 by a linearly increasing function which starts from zero at @xmath177 and goes to 1 at @xmath179 mev , where the @xmath2 mesons go on shell .",
    "this will cut the dileptons that go through the @xmath2 spectral function down by a factor of @xmath157 .",
    "we have argued that the dileptons produced from the @xmath2 mesons between @xmath172 mev and @xmath180 mev are strongly suppressed .",
    "the question then is : what are the dileptons observed in na60 ( and also in ceres ) ?",
    "we suggest that the answer to this is that they are almost , if not entirely , _ produced outside _ of the hadronic freedom region , namely , at the flash temperature @xmath65 .",
    "we present arguments to support this suggestion .      for our purpose ,",
    "we consider most useful the article on radial flow of thermal dileptons by r.  arnaldi _ et al .",

    "the principal thrust of this paper was that the bump near @xmath203 mev is populated predominantly by near - on - shell @xmath2 s that are separated by the blue - shifting in the effective thermodynamics flow , and that in the invariant mass region below @xmath120 770 mev in which br scaling vector mesons should be present , the photon coupling is highly suppressed in accordance with the hadronic freedom . as a result ,",

    "we suggest that the most likely mechanism that produces the dominant component of the  background \" is pions in heat bath in strong interactions that populate at or just below the flash point with the shuryak - brown kinematical effects taken into account .",
    "our basic premise is that in the hadronic freedom scenario , all hadrons , including pions , flow freely from the critical temperature to the flash point in a time of @xmath204 fm / c .",
    "( as mentioned , pions will also be weakly interacting like other hadrons , because the hidden gauge coupling @xmath43  which governs the p - wave @xmath64 interaction through @xmath2 exchange  is small . ) in this regime , the photon has a direct coupling to a pion due to the violation of vector dominance with @xmath205  which would reflect the presence of the vector manifestation ",
    "but relatively few leptons are expected to be produced by the pions in that regime .    reaching the flash point , however , all hadrons making up @xmath206 degrees of freedom going on - shell , with the hidden gauge coupling regaining its free - space strength , will produce dileptons with the vector dominance recovered with @xmath82 going to 2 .",
    "the vector mesons produced in the interactions at the flash point will go into flow and appear at on - shell mass .",
    "now in the central collisions , the freezeout temperature is lower than the flash temperature , so the hadrons which go on shell at the flash temperature go several generations before they freeze out at @xmath67 .",
    "the large number of pions present between @xmath65 and @xmath67  not in the flow  will interact strongly producing , among others , copious @xmath110 s which will emit the lepton pairs .",

    "these will populate the invariant masses below the @xmath207 peak .",
    "the @xmath70 s so produced could also emit dileptons  la dusling et al .",

    "the original idea of br scaling was that in medium , because of background density or temperature which affects the  vacuum \" structure , hadron masses , other than that of the pion , that are dynamically generated had to be scaled as a function of the quark condensate .",
    "in many - body systems where such a vacuum change is generated by strong nuclear interactions , this idea can be addressed only in an effective field theory framework and not directly in qcd language .",
    "so the question then is : in what way would br scaling manifest in complex many - body processes ?",
    "the answer to this question depends on scales that are involved .",
    "this point was recognized in the early phenomenological papers by brown and rho where the scaling effect was looked for in spin - isospin dependent nuclear interactions , notably the tensor forces .",
    "thus very near the chiral transition point , hls@xmath25 theory , well - defined by the vm fixed point , makes an extremely simple and clear - cut prediction  whether right or wrong  in the property of the vector mesons @xmath2 and @xmath3 and hence of physical observables associated with them .",
    "however away from the vm fixed point , the situation is quite different and a lot more intricate .",
    "while the parameters of the hls@xmath25 lagrangian are directly linked to the quark condensate thanks both to the local gauge invariance and to the matching to qcd , most physical observables , while dependent on br scaling , have complicated dependence on the chiral order parameter .",
    "for instance , at the scale of the structure of light nuclei , br scaling can figure in giving effective nuclear forces .",
    "most striking of all in this category is the archaeologically long lifetime of the @xmath223c decay explained in terms of the tensor force that results from an intricate cancelation between the pionic term and the @xmath2 term where br scaling enters through the parametric mass term  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , near the fermi liquid fixed point of nuclear matter , br scaling manifests itself in the landau fermi liquid parameter @xmath224 , explaining how exchange currents affect the orbital gyromagnetic ratio in heavy nuclei  @xcite .",
    "it is in this context ( as stressed in @xcite ) that one would have to understand the role of dileptons as a possible litmus indicator for chiral symmetry in hot and/or dense matter .    using the notion of the hadronic freedom ,",
    "we have argued that the dileptons measured in heavy ion collisions are mostly , if not all , from the @xmath110 s outside of the hadronic freedom ( or fireball ) regime .",
    "we should stress that the hadronic freedom , a notion derived from hls@xmath25 with its vm fixed point , has an additional assumption extraneous to hls@xmath25 in the vm that requires verification .",
    "it assumes that the @xmath2 width at the vm fixed point is not zero whereas a strict adherence to hls@xmath25 with no additional ingredients  which we believe is not complete  would imply that the width vanishes .",
    "this renders it to a possible falsification .",
    "an observation of a strong enhancement of the dilepton production in the _ close vicinity _ of @xmath4 , while giving a partial support to the simplest hls@xmath25 , would falsify the notion of the hadronic freedom and hence our scenario on dileptons described in this paper .",
    "the violation of vector dominance , a characteristic of hls@xmath25 in the vector manifestation , could also be subject to falsification .",
    "while dileptons from @xmath2 mesons are suppressed , one expects dileptons coming from pions via direct coupling due to the vd violation .",
    "to see this effect , it would be necessary to subtract _ all _ the  background \" coming from on - shell sources .",
    "this might be a daunting task but if such effect is found , it will be a  smoking - gun \" signal for hls@xmath25 in the vector manifestation and also an indirect support for br scaling .",
    "there have been discussions , both experimental and theoretical , on the behavior of vector mesons in cold dense nuclear medium  @xcite .",
    "experiments in the upcoming accelerators will surely generate a lot of activities in this area",
    ". it would be difficult to probe directly the density regime in the close vicinity of the vm fixed point , so what one can do is to study various precursor effects of matter at densities near that of nuclear matter .",
    "the jlab  @xcite , cd - bonn  @xcite and kek  @xcite experiments belong to this class .",
    "what is addressed in this class of experiments is the  mass \" of the vector mesons @xmath2 and @xmath3  seen \" inside nuclear medium at a density @xmath225 .",
    "the measured quantities reflect the pole mass which in hls@xmath25 is given by what is equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ pole - mass ] ) in density , ^2=a^*f_^*^2g^*^2 + ^*[dense ] where the asterisk here stands for the _ intrinsic _ dependence on the chiral order parameter , i.e. , the quark condensate , which changes with density and @xmath226 is the ",
    "dense loop \" corrections gotten from the hls@xmath25 lagrangian in a suitable perturbative series . now to address the dense loop corrections , it is necessary to introduce fermionic degrees of freedom to implement matter density . in principle",
    "this could be done in terms of dense skyrmions in hls@xmath25 or better in hls@xmath32 involving the infinite tower of vector mesons in 4d or instantons in 5d which automatically takes into account the intricate vacuum structure in which both pions and vector mesons are condensed generating a self - consistent baryonic background for fluctuating mesons . in a sophisticated version of this type of approach",
    ", one could also build in @xmath227 s , thereby incorporating such collective excitations as  sobars \"  @xcite etc .",
    "efforts are being made to arrive at dense matter through this approach but up to date there has been little progress along this line .",
    "what has been done up to date is to introduce , somewhat ad hoc , quasiquarks in a gauge invariant way into hls@xmath25  @xcite . at one loop order ,",
    "we can rewrite ( [ dense ] ) as ^2=a^*f_^*^2g^*^2 + 12 g^*^2 cg^*[dense1 ] where @xmath228 is the pion decay constant renormalized by dense one - loop corrections , @xmath229 is a known function of density and @xmath230 is the only undetermined constant in the lagrangian which is of @xmath231 .",
    "we can make a rough estimate of ( [ dense1 ] ) at nuclear matter density  @xcite , ( m_v^*/m_v)^2(n_0 ) & & ( f_^*(n_0)/f_)^2 + 0.21 c + & & 0.64 + 0.21 c[dense2 ] where we have used the value @xmath232 quoted in the literature at nuclear matter density  @xcite . if @xmath233 and @xmath234 , one sees that the dense loop corrections  that comprise essentially of mundane nuclear interactions in the given field theory framework  are comparable to the first term that purports to provide direct information on br scaling . we see from this simple calculation that in order to reveal unequivocally the role of br scaling , one first has to define precisely what quantities one is to zero - in on in a precisely defined effective field theory , and then to compute many - body corrections in a way consistent with the effective theory so defined .",
    "phenomenological lagrangians constructed solely to fit free - space quantities  hence valid at tree order and devoid of the wilsonian renormalization - group flow  @xcite  are not likely , if not impossible , to provide useful information of this subtle nature . in hls@xmath25",
    ", it is the parametric mass ( first term on the rhs of ( [ dense1 ] ) )  and not the measured pole mass  that carries the looked - for information .    that dileptons , considered to be an ideal snapshot of the chiral order parameter , appear to be blind to br",
    "scaling may seem to indicate that br scaling can not be probed unambiguously .",
    "this is however not the case .",
    "there are in fact certain quantities that could provide a clear - cut signal for the br scaling at work .",
    "one such case that has been studied is the pion velocity @xmath235 at @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath2 mass becoming degenerate with the pion mass as @xmath83 in hls@xmath25 in the vm makes the pion velocity rapidly approach 1  @xcite , whereas in the absence of the massless @xmath2 , @xmath235 can be rigorously shown to vanish  @xcite .",
    "this is a night - and - day difference .",
    "the pion velocity going to zero would be a strong indication that the @xmath2 mass does not drop , hence the vector manifestation is not realized in nature and would call for a revamping of the hidden gauge structure in the form of hls@xmath25 , perhaps requiring the infinite tower of vector mesons .",
    "it would be a challenge to both theorists and experimentalist to find other cases where hls@xmath25 in the vector manifestation can be exposed equally directly and ultimately to exploit hls@xmath32 in exploring the intricate nature of matter near the critical point . in this connection , it is of importance to note that in holographic qcd , baryons emerge as coherent states of pions and vector mesons , in particular , the @xmath2 meson , and the vector modes  seen \" in medium are excitations on top of this ground state in which both pions and vector mesons are condensed .",
    "thus the property of vector mesons in baryonic medium is expected to be vastly more intricate than the naive picture would give .",
