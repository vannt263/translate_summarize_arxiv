    "in this paper we discuss the use of the cluster variation method ( cvm ) in mapping out the phase diagram of the gonihedric 3d ising model .",
    "the gonihedric 3d ising model is a generalization of the usual 3d ising model where planar peierls boundaries between @xmath3 and @xmath4 spins can be created at zero energy cost .",
    "it has been introduced in @xcite in relations with string theory . the cvm method in other contexts",
    "has shown itself to be an accurate and economical way of describing the phase diagram both for first order and continuous transitions .",
    "as both the model and the method may be unfamiliar , we outline both in turn before going on to describe our results .",
    "the genesis of the model is in a novel discretized random surface theory , the so - called gonihedric string @xcite , @xmath5 where the sum is over the edges of some triangulated surface , @xmath6 , @xmath7 is some exponent , and @xmath8 is the dihedral angle between neighbouring triangles with common link @xmath9 .",
    "this definition of the action was inspired by the geometrical notion of the linear size of a surface , as originally defined by steiner @xcite .    in eq .",
    "( [ e4a ] ) the surface itself is discretized , rather than the space in which it is embedded .",
    "an alternative approach to discretizing the linear size would be to restrict the allowed surfaces to the plaquettes of a ( hyper)cubic lattice , which corresponds to also discretizing the target space .",
    "savvidy and wegner @xcite did this and rewrote the resulting model as an equivalent generalized ising model using the geometrical spin cluster boundaries to define the surfaces .",
    "the energy of a surface on a cubic lattice is then given by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the number of links where two plaquettes meet at a right angle , @xmath12 is the number of links where four plaquettes meet at right angles , and @xmath1 is a free parameter which determines the relative weight of a self - intersection of the surface . in the limit @xmath13 the surfaces are strongly self - avoiding , whereas the opposite limit @xmath14 is that of `` phantom '' surfaces that pass through themselves without any energy penalty .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the energy is very different from that of the standard 3d ising model with nearest neighbour interactions where the surfaces are weighted entirely by their areas and not at all by their embeddings .    on a cubic lattice",
    "the generalized gonihedric ising hamiltonian which reproduces the energy @xmath10 contains nearest neighbour ( @xmath15 ) , next to nearest neighbour ( @xmath16 ) and round a plaquette ( @xmath17 $ ] ) terms @xmath18}\\sigma_{i } \\sigma_{j}\\sigma_{k } \\sigma_{l}. \\label{e1}\\ ] ] such generalized ising actions and their equivalent surface formulations have quite complicated phase structures for generic choices of the couplings @xcite .",
    "the particular ratio of couplings in eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) , however , is special and introduces a novel symmetry into the model , related to a zero - temperature high degeneracy point where it is possible to flip any plane of spins at zero energy cost .",
    "various approaches have been used to investigate these models , including a zero - temperature analysis , mean - field theory and monte carlo simulations .",
    "we briefly outline the results thus obtained for comparison with our cvm calculation in this paper .    in an analysis of the zero temperature ground states of the model",
    "we write the full lattice hamiltonian as a sum over individual cube hamiltonians @xmath19 and observe that if the lattice can be tiled by a cube configuration minimizing the individual @xmath19 then the ground state energy density is @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "this approach confirms that a layered ground state with parallel layers of flipped spins perpendicular to one of the lattice axes and arbitrary interlayer spacing is degenerate with the ferromagnetic ground state for all @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , at @xmath21 extra ground states appear where all the spins of one of the 2 sublattices of the cubic lattice are flipped @xcite .    in the mean field approximation the spins",
    "are replaced by average site magnetizations .",
    "the calculation of the mean field free energy can be performed by considering independent magnetizations for the 8 sites of an elementary cube .",
    "therefore , as in the zero temperature approach , the energy can be still decomposed into a sum of individual cube terms .",
    "numerical iteration of the resulting eight coupled mean - field equations shows a single transition from a paramagnetic high temperature state to a layered , or the equivalent ferromagnetic , low temperature state @xcite .",
    "the inverse critical temperature @xmath22 determined in this fashion decreases quite sharply with @xmath1 .",
    "the flip symmetry of the model poses something of a problem when carrying out monte carlo simulations .",
    "a simple ferromagnetic order parameter such as the magnetization @xmath23 will be zero in general , because of the layered nature of the ground state .",
    "staggered magnetizations also fail as order parameters because the interlayer spacing can be arbitrary . in @xcite boundary conditions",
    "have been suitably chosen in order to pick out the ferromagnetic ground state allowing the use of standard ( unstaggered ) magnetization to extract magnetic critical exponents .",
    "monte carlo simulations with such boundary conditions @xcite for different @xmath1 values on lattices of various sizes allowed a finite size scaling analysis to be carried out in order to extract estimates for some of the critical exponents . for @xmath24",
    "this gave @xmath25 from the ratios of slopes of binder s magnetization cumulants , @xmath26 from the fss of the susceptibility @xmath27 , and @xmath28 from the fss of the energy with two different sorts of fixed boundary conditions .",
    "all these exponents , rather remarkably given that the model is defined in three dimensions , are close to the onsager values of the two - dimensional ising model with nearest neighbour interactions , as was the critical temperature @xmath29 .",
    "simulations of other @xmath30 values gave very similar results .",
    "however , the @xmath21 model @xcite @xmath31}^ { } \\sigma_{i } \\sigma_{j}\\sigma_{k } \\sigma_{l}. \\label{e2}\\ ] ] appeared to be a special case , displaying a first order transition .",
    "the transition stayed first order at @xmath32 but softened rapidly as @xmath1 increased , so the crossover to the second order behaviour seen at @xmath24 was quite sharp .",
    "the cluster variation method , or cvm for short , is based on a truncation of the cluster ( cumulant ) expansion of the free energy density functional on which the variational formulation of statistical mechanics is based @xcite .",
    "unlike mean field theory it generally locates rather accurately the boundaries between different phases in complex phase diagrams and , using the recently proposed cluster variation ",
    "pad approximant method @xcite one can extract non - classical , precise estimates of the critical exponents .    for a generic ising - like model described by a hamiltonian @xmath33 on a lattice @xmath34 the exact free energy",
    "can in principle be obtained by minimizing the functional @xmath35 = { \\rm tr }   \\left(\\rho_\\lambda \\ ; h    + \\frac{1}{\\beta } \\rho_\\lambda \\ln \\rho_\\lambda \\right),\\ ] ] of the trial density matrix @xmath36 , subject to @xmath37",
    ".    assuming that the hamiltonian can be written as a sum of cluster contributions @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a collection of clusters that suffices to enumerate the interactions , an approximate free energy functional can be written in the form @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a suitable set of clusters ( which must contain @xmath39 as a subset ) , the largest of which ( called maximal clusters ) have to reflect in some way the symmetry of the lattice , and the @xmath42 are numerical coefficients determined by @xmath43 the constraints are now @xmath44 and the latter can actually be used as a definition of the density matrices of the subclusters of the maximal clusters .",
    "an important feature of the cvm is that the local minima of the approximate free energy can be easily found by means of a simple iterative procedure called natural iteration method @xcite , which has the property that , for any given initial set of density matrices , the iteration always converges to a local minimum of the free energy .    in the present work ,",
    "we have used the cube approximation of the cvm , that is the maximal clusters of the set @xmath41 are the elementary cubic cells of our simple cubic lattice ; for this approximation the free energy density functional has the form ( see @xcite for an application to the simple nearest neighbour ising model ) @xmath45 & = & { \\rm tr } ( \\rho_8 h_8 ) + \\frac{1}{\\beta } \\bigg [ { \\rm tr } { \\cal l } ( \\rho_8 )   - \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{\\rm plaquettes }   { \\rm tr } { \\cal l } ( \\rho_{4,{\\rm plaquette } } ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{4 } \\sum_{\\rm edges } { \\rm tr } { \\cal l } ( \\rho_{2,{\\rm edge } } ) - \\frac{1}{8 } \\sum_{\\rm sites } { \\rm tr } { \\cal",
    "l } ( \\rho_{1,{\\rm site } } ) \\bigg ] , \\label{fcube}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the contribution of a single cube to the hamiltonian ( when splitting the total hamiltonian @xmath33 into single cube contributions one has to keep in mind that nearest neighbour interactions are shared by four cubes and then will get a coefficient 1/4 in @xmath46 , and similarly next - nearest neighbour and plaquette interactions will get a coefficient 1/2 ) , @xmath47 , @xmath48 with @xmath49 ( 4 , 2 , 1 ) denotes the cube ( respectively plaquette , edge , site ) density matrix , and the sums in the entropy part are over all plaquettes ( edges , sites ) of a single cube .",
    "notice that we have not assumed any _ a priori _ symmetry property for our density matrices .",
    "the cluster variation method can be viewed as a generalized mean field theory , and hence it is clear that it can give only classical predictions for the critical exponents . in order to overcome this difficulty , one can use the recently proposed cluster variation ",
    "pad approximant method ( cvpam ) @xcite , which has proven to be a rather accurate technique , although not very demanding in terms of computer time .",
    "the basic idea of the cvpam is that , since the cvm gives , for ising - like models , very accurate results at low and high temperatures ( i.e.  far enough from the critical point ) , one can try to extrapolate this results in order to study the critical behaviour . in order to determine the critical exponent of the order parameter @xmath50 , for example , one calculates @xmath51 with the cvm up to a temperature at which the error can be estimated to be very small ( typically of order @xmath52 ) , and then constructs , by a simple interpolation , pad approximants for the logarithmic derivative of @xmath51 : the pole and the corresponding residue of each pad approximant are then estimates for the critical temperature and for the critical exponent respectively .",
    "in this section we describe our results for the phase diagram of the model ( [ e1 ] ) at different values of the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "when the temperature is lowered , the model ( [ e1 ] ) undergoes a phase transition towards a low temperature ordered phase : this transition has been investigated by means of the cvm in the cube approximation described in the preceding section .",
    "first of all we describe our results at @xmath24 . we have solved numerically our approximate variational principle for @xmath53 ranging in the interval @xmath54 and we have calculated the values @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 of the local minima of the free energy corresponding respectively to the paramagnetic , ferromagnetic and layered phases .",
    "the three functions @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ free - ener ] .",
    "when @xmath58 the unique local minimum is that corresponding to the paramagnetic phase ; in the interval @xmath59 we find both the paramagnetic and layered minima of the free energy and @xmath60 in the whole interval . at low temperature",
    "when @xmath61 the ferromagnetic local minimum appears and it happens to be the global minimum of the free energy .",
    "therefore the cvm predicts that the zero temperature degeneracy between phases with all possible sequences of  @xmath3 \" and  @xmath4 \" planes is broken at finite temperature .",
    "the transition at @xmath62 from the paramagnetic to the low temperature ferromagnetic phase is critical . indeed ,",
    "when the inverse temperature @xmath53 is lowered below @xmath22 , the ferromagnetic local minimum of the free energy disappears .",
    "we have studied the model ( [ e1 ] ) for other values of the parameter @xmath1 ranging in the interval @xmath63 . for each @xmath64",
    "we have found that at low temperature the model is in the ferromagnetic phase and we have calculated the inverse transition temperature @xmath22 ; in fig .",
    "[ kbeta ] we have plotted @xmath22 as a function of @xmath1 .    at sufficiently low values of @xmath1 , that is @xmath65 , the nature of the transition changes over to a first order behaviour which is strengthened as @xmath1 is lowered .    in table",
    "[ tab ] our results for @xmath22 are compared with monte carlo and mean field approximation results obtained in @xcite ; monte carlo and cvm predictions are in good agreement .",
    "* table 1 *    1 truecm    . our results for the inverse transition temperature @xmath22 at different values of the parameter @xmath1 are listed .",
    "these cvm results are compared with mean field and monte carlo previous results . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     1.5 truecm    at @xmath21 the first order transition is at @xmath66 .",
    "moreover at low temperature the layered phases , the ferromagnetic phase and their antiferromagnetic versions obtained by flipping the site - magnetizations of one of the 2 sublattices of the cubic lattice coexist with the same free energy . in fig .",
    "[ kzero ] the free energy of the paramagnetic phase ( dash - dotted line ) and of the coexisting ordered phases ( solid line ) are depicted",
    ".    therefore , at @xmath21 the zero temperature symmetry of the model is not violated , and the cvm correctly respects the ferro - antiferromagnetic exact symmetry of the partition function .    finally , for some values of @xmath1 such that the transition is critical , that is @xmath67 , we have evaluated the magnetization critical exponent @xmath53 by means of the cluster variation - pad approximant method @xcite , obtaining @xmath68 at @xmath69 and @xmath70 at @xmath71 .",
    "these results clearly suggest that the exponent is independent of @xmath1 and a prudential estimate is @xmath2 , which has to be compared with the conjectured onsager value 1/8 on one side , but also with the estimate , based on finite size scaling of monte carlo results @xcite , @xmath72 : given the monte carlo estimate @xmath25 one can say that the @xmath53 values predicted by cvm and simulations are in rather remarkable agreement .",
    "in this work we have applied the cube approximation of the cluster variation method to find the phase diagram of the gonihedric @xmath73 ising model defined in eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) .",
    "moreover the low - temperature cvm results for the order parameter have been used to evaluate the exponent @xmath53 at @xmath67 via the cluster variation ",
    "pad approximant method .",
    "we summarize here our main results .",
    "the cvm approximation gives values of the inverse critical temperature in quite good agreement with those predicted by monte carlo simulations .",
    "the transition remains critical for @xmath74 , where it becomes of first order .",
    "our evaluation of the critical exponent @xmath2 of the magnetization is also close to the simulations results of @xcite .",
    "the new result of this paper is that the cvm predicts at finite temperatures a violation of the symmetry of the hamiltonian ( [ e1 ] ) .",
    "we find that in the ordered region of the model the ferromagnetic phase is always stable with respect to the lamellar phase .",
    "this suggests to study the model ( [ e1 ] ) in a parameter space larger than the one used in this paper .",
    "the knowledge of the global topology of the phase diagram in an enlarged parameter space @xcite could be useful to answer the main question set by the monte carlo results and confirmed by the results of this paper about the nature of the critical transition of the model ( [ e1 ] ) at sufficiently high values of @xmath1 .",
