    "<S> it is separated from the high - seniority , low - spin region by the line @xmath105 which tends to @xmath106 for @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> hence this region disappears in the large-@xmath4 limit .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the ground state of a bec consisting of atoms with spin @xmath0 can be of three different types : ( i ) a maximum - seniority spin - aligned , ( ii ) a low - seniority low - spin , or ( iii ) a maximum - seniority low - spin configuration . </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath110 are the so - called traceless boson operators  @xcite which are defined as ( see also chapt .  8 of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) @xmath111 we emphasize that  ( [ wave ] ) are the _ exact _ finite-@xmath4 expressions for the eigenstates of the hamiltonian  ( [ hamsol ] ) . since in the large-@xmath4 limit the traceless boson operators @xmath112 become identical to @xmath113 , we arrive at a simple interpretation of the three types of configurations : ( i ) spin - aligned , ( ii ) condensed into _ </S>",
    "<S> pairs of atoms _ coupled to @xmath1 , and ( iii ) condensed into _ triplets of atoms _ coupled to @xmath1 .    how will these features evolve with increasing spin @xmath5 of the atoms ? for arbitrary interaction strengths @xmath33 in the different @xmath20 channels the hamiltonian  ( [ hamgen ] ) is not solvable . by imposing @xmath114 conditions on @xmath33 </S>",
    "<S> it can be brought into the form  ( [ hamsol ] ) and this gives an idea of the structure of the general phase diagram by constructing a two - dimensional slice of it . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for atoms with spin @xmath52 the elimination of @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ conditions ] ) yields the condition @xmath115 . for @xmath116 </S>",
    "<S> more conditions on @xmath33 are found . if all conditions are satisfied , the phase diagram in @xmath57 and @xmath58 with @xmath117 has properties similar to those in the @xmath0 case . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis requires the knowledge of the multiplicity @xmath118 , ( _ i.e. _ , the number of spin-@xmath5 atom states with seniority @xmath66 coupled to total spin @xmath20 ) which can be derived from the @xmath69 branching rule  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for sufficiently large even @xmath4 there are four competing ground states with @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 , the latter of which disappears as a ground state in the large-@xmath4 limit . for sufficiently large odd @xmath4 the four competing ground states </S>",
    "<S> have @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 , the latter two being separated by the line @xmath125c/(4f+6)$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the results correspond to what is found in the @xmath0 case and lead to an essentially identical @xmath126 phase diagram .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we point out that the appearance of exact seniority ground states requires weaker conditions on @xmath33 than those that have been discussed so far . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the spin - aligned configuration @xmath127 is always an eigenstate of the general hamiltonian  ( [ hamgen ] ) because the @xmath128 state is unique . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it can be shown  @xcite that seniority is a good quantum number if the interaction strengths @xmath33 satisfy @xmath129 conditions only ( where @xmath130 is the largest integer smaller than or equal to @xmath34 ) . for all cases of any conceivable interest for becs , this reduces to no condition on the strengths @xmath33 for @xmath131 or just a single one for @xmath132 . </S>",
    "<S> so there is at most a single condition required for all eigenstates to carry exact seniority and for the results of this paper to be valid . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the determination of the complete phase diagram for @xmath2 with unconstrained interaction strengths @xmath33 remains a problem worthy of further investigation . </S>"
