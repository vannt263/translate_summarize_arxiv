    "the cosmic censorship hypothesis@xcite is a crucial ansatz for the theorems of black holes@xcite .",
    "there are two versions for this hypothesis . for spacetimes with physically reasonable matter fields ,",
    "the weak version claims that a spacetime singularity as a result of generic non - singular initial data is not visible from infinity , while the strong version claims that a spacetime singularity developed from non - singular initial data is invisible for any observer .",
    "a singularity censored by the strong version is called a naked singularity , while a singularity censored by the weak version is called a globally naked singularity . however",
    ", previous theoretical studies have revealed several candidates for the counter - examples of this hypothesis@xcite .",
    "although further detailed and careful studies about these candidates are necessary , these might have some physical importance .",
    "if a globally naked singularity forms , what can we detect from there ?",
    "in connection with this issue , nakamura , shibata and one of the present authors ( kn ) have proposed a conjecture ; if globally naked singularities form , large spacetime curvatures in the neighborhood of these can propagate away to infinity in the form of gravitational radiation , and as a result , almost all of the mass of these naked singularities is lost through this large gravitational emission@xcite",
    ". if this conjecture is true , the formation processes of the globally naked singularities might be very important for gravitational - wave astronomy@xcite .",
    "the cylindrically symmetric system will play an important role in getting significant information about this issue by the following reasons ; in the asymptotically flat case , the singularities are necessarily naked@xcite ; there is a degree of gravitational radiation ; this system is very simple .",
    "there are a few numerical studies on gravitational emissions by cylindrically symmetric gravitational collapse@xcite .",
    "recently , the present authors have investigated the high - speed collapse of cylindrically symmetric thick shell composed of dust@xcite and perfect fluid with non - vanishing pressure@xcite . in these studies",
    ", we use the high - speed approximation which is a kind of the perturbation analysis in the background morgan solution describing the motion of a cylindrical null dust . in the first paper",
    ", it has been revealed that in the gravitational collapse of a cylindrically symmetric thick dust shell , the thinner shell leads to the larger amount of gravitational radiation .",
    "this result gives a resolution of an apparent inconsistency between the previous works . in the second paper",
    ", we showed that the pressure decelerates the collapsing velocity so significantly that the high - speed approximation scheme breaks down before a singularity forms if the equation of state is moderately hard .",
    "for example , in the case of mono - atomic ideal gas which seems to be physically reasonable in the high - energy state due to the asymptotic freedom of elementary interactions , the high - speed collapse is prevented by the pressure and thus there is a possibility that the pressure halts the formation of a spacetime singularity in the case of this cylindrical gravitational collapse .",
    "however , we should note that if initial collapsing velocity is very large , a region with very large mass concentration can be realized in the neighborhood of the symmetric axis @xmath0 . in this region ,",
    "the tidal force for free falling observers can be so large that general relativity breaks down and the quantum theory of gravity will be necessary to understand the physical processes realized there . such a region can be regarded as a singularity for general relativity , called a ` spacetime border'@xcite . by contrast , in case that the equation of state is sufficiently soft , the high - speed collapse is maintained until a globally naked singularity forms .    in this paper , we investigate the gravitational waves from a naked singularity formed by the high - speed gravitational collapse of a cylindrical thick shell composed of dust . in the previous paper@xcite ,",
    "we have investigated the generation process of those in the causal past of the cauchy horizon associated with the naked singularity , i.e. , the region which does not suffer the influence of the naked singularity ( for details of the cauchy horizon , causal future and causal past , see , for example , the textbook by wald@xcite ) . on the other hand , in this paper , we focus on the generation process of the gravitational waves in the causal future of the naked singularity . in order to know what happens in the causal future of the naked singularity , we need specify the boundary condition at the naked singularity .",
    "this is equivalent to defining the naked singularity as a physical entity .",
    "we would like to show that in the high - speed approximation scheme , there is a boundary condition that all the metric and matter variables are everywhere finite at least up to the first order .",
    "there are several studies on how to fix the boundary condition for test fields or gravitational perturbations in static naked singular spacetimes@xcite .",
    "by contrast , the present case is dynamical , and as far as we are aware , this is the first example of gravitational emissions from a naked singularity developed from non - singular initial data .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii , we present the basic equations of the cylindrically symmetric dust system . in sec.iii , we derive the basic equations in the high - speed approximation scheme which describe the gravitational collapse with velocity almost equal to the speed of light @xmath1 . in sec.iv",
    ", we consider the boundary condition at the background naked singularity and then present solutions for the basic equations given in sec.iii . in sec.v",
    ", we study the gravitational emissions from the naked singularity .",
    "finally sec.vi is devoted to summary and discussion .    in this paper , we adopt @xmath2 unit and",
    "basically follow the convention of the riemann and metric tensors and the notation in the textbook by wald@xcite .",
    "in this paper , we focus on the spacetime with whole - cylinder symmetry which is defined by the following line element@xcite , @xmath3 then einstein equations are @xmath4 where a dot means the derivative with respect to @xmath5 while a prime means the derivative with respect to @xmath6 .    as mentioned , we consider the dust fluid as a matter field . the stress - energy tensor is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is rest mass density and @xmath9 is a 4-velocity of the fluid element . due to the assumption of the whole - cylinder symmetry ,",
    "the components of the 4-velocity @xmath9 are written as @xmath10 by the normalization @xmath11 , @xmath12 is expressed as @xmath13    here denoting the determinant of the metric tensor @xmath14 by @xmath15 , we introduce new density variable @xmath16 defined by @xmath17 the components of the stress - energy tensor are then expressed as @xmath18 and the other components vanish .",
    "the equation of motion @xmath19 leads to @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the retarded time and @xmath22 is the partial derivative of @xmath23 with fixed advanced time @xmath24 .",
    "the first equation comes from the @xmath5-component while the second one comes from the @xmath6-component .",
    "the @xmath25- and @xmath26-components are trivial .",
    "to estimate the energy flux of the gravitational radiation , we investigate @xmath27-energy @xmath28 and its flux vector proposed by thorne@xcite .",
    "@xmath27-energy @xmath29 is the energy per unit coordinate length along @xmath25-direction within the radius @xmath6 at time @xmath5 , which is defined by @xmath30 the energy flux vector @xmath31 associated to the c - energy is defined by @xmath32 by its definition , @xmath33 is divergence free . using the equations of motion for the metric variables",
    ", we obtain the following expression of @xmath27-energy flux vector , @xmath34 and the other components vanish .",
    "let us consider the ingoing null limit of the cylindrical dust fluid . from eqs.([eq",

    "hence in the limit of @xmath38 with @xmath16 fixed , the stress - energy tensor agrees with that of the collapsing null dust .",
    "this means that in the case of very large collapsing velocity , i.e. , @xmath39 , the dust fluid system will be well approximated by the null dust system",
    ". then we treat the `` deviation @xmath40 of the 4-velocity from null '' as a perturbation and perform linear perturbation analyses .    in the case of the complete null dust @xmath41 , the solution is easily obtained as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is an arbitrary function of the advanced time @xmath44 .",
    "this solution was first obtained by morgan@xcite and was studied subsequently by letelier and wang@xcite and nolan@xcite in detail . assuming the null energy condition",
    ", the density variable @xmath16 is non - negative .",
    "this means that @xmath45 is non - decreasing function of @xmath44 .",
    "the situation of the collapsing null dust solution can be understood by fig.1 . in this paper , we assume that the density variable @xmath16 has a compact support @xmath46 which is depicted by a shaded region in fig.1",
    ". we can find in eqs.([eq : st - tensor ] ) and ( [ eq : r - bg ] ) that if @xmath16 does not vanish at the symmetric axis @xmath0 , components of the stress - energy tensor @xmath47 with respect to the coordinate basis diverge there , and the same is true for the ricci tensor by einstein equations .",
    "this is a naked singularity which is depicted by the dashed line at @xmath0 in @xmath48 in fig.1 .",
    "although all the scalar polynomials of riemann tensor vanish there , freely falling observers suffer infinite tidal force at @xmath0 in @xmath49 ; this type of singularity is called _ p.p . _ curvature singularity@xcite . the cauchy horizon",
    "associated with this intermediate naked singularity is represented by the short dashed line @xmath50 in fig.1 . on the other hand , the region at @xmath0 in @xmath51 is conical singularity which is depicted by the thick dotted line in this figure .",
    "we introduce a small parameter @xmath52 and assume the order of the variables as @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "further we rewrite the variables @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath16 as @xmath57 and assume that @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are @xmath61 , where @xmath62 we call the perturbative analysis with respect to this small parameter @xmath52 the high speed approximation scheme .",
    "the 1st order equations with respect to @xmath52 are given as follows ; the einstein equations ( [ eq : einstein-1])-([eq : einstein-2 ] ) lead to @xmath63 the conservation law ( [ eq : conservation - full ] ) leads to @xmath64 the euler equation ( [ eq : euler - full ] ) becomes as @xmath65 where we have used eq.([eq : conservation - linear ] ) .",

    "further , from eqs.([eq : del - r - gamma ] ) and ( [ eq : del - t - gamma ] ) , we find that @xmath68 is also constant in the vacuum region .",
    "therefore up to the first order , @xmath27-energy is constant in the vacuum region .",
    "this means that in the vacuum region , @xmath27-energy flux vector @xmath31 vanishes up to the first order and thus it is a second order quantity which is given by @xmath69 @xmath27-energy flux vector takes very similar form to that of massless klein - gordon field .",
    "in this section , we study the behaviors of perturbation variables in the causal future of the background naked singularity .",
    "einstein equations are hyperbolic differential equations which send out the information of the background naked singularity into its causal future . therefore in order to get the solutions of the basic equations for the perturbation variables in the causal future of the background naked singularity , we need specify the boundary condition for these at the background naked singularity .    in general , it is very difficult to control the solutions by the boundary conditions due to the nonlinearity of einstein equations .",
    "however , fortunately , there is a great advantage in the present situation ; the perturbation variables can be regarded as test fields with sources in the fixed background morgan spacetime .",
    "this seems to be similar situation to the problems investigated by wald and a several researchers , i.e. , the behavior of test fields in naked singular static spacetimes@xcite .",
    "however , there is a significant difference between the previous studies and the present case . in the previous cases , the effect of the naked singularity appears in the differential operator in the equations of motion for the test fields . on the other hand , in the present case",
    ", the manifestation of the naked singularity appears as source terms in the differential equations for the perturbation variables .",
    "therefore we have to determine the boundary condition from different point of view from previous works .",
    "we do not know the law of physics at the spacetime singularity , i.e. , the quantum theory of gravity and hence , at present , it is difficult to impose a physically satisfactory boundary condition at the naked singularity .",
    "there is a possibility that the quantum gravity puts the additional source terms on the right hand side of the differential equations ( [ eq : del - r - gamma])-([eq : psi - linear ] ) at the background naked singularity ; the additional source term might be a delta - function like one causing gravitational wave bursts , or by contrast , might completely cancel out the original source term and , as a result , lead no gravitational radiation from the naked singularity .",
    "however , at first glance , it is expected that the geometrical structure of the spacetime investigated here is not so different from the background morgan spacetime even in the neighborhood of the background naked singularity .",
    "thus in order to search for such a solution , we require that the perturbation variables are expressed in the form of the maclaurin series around the naked singularity .",
    "as will be shown below , this condition guarantees that all the perturbation variables are everywhere finite up to the first order , and this is just what we expect .",
    "the cylindrical thick shell composed of dust also forms a naked singularity at the same coordinate position as the background naked singularity .",
    "the cauchy horizon associated with this naked singularity is located also at the same coordinate position as the background one .",
    "equation ( [ eq : gamma - linear ] ) is easily solved . in this equation",
    ", there is no singularity even at the background naked singularity . before the appearance of the background naked singularity ,",

    "we also impose the same condition at @xmath0 after the background naked singularity formation @xmath74 .",
    "then we obtain general solutions for @xmath70 @xmath75 where @xmath76 is an arbitrary @xmath77 function . here",
    "we should note that after the appearance of the naked singularity @xmath78 , the regularity condition @xmath73 does no longer guarantee the locally minkowskian nature since the background spacetime itself does not have the locally minkowskian nature at the naked singularity .",
    "the solution for the euler equation ( [ eq : v - linear ] ) is given by @xmath79 where @xmath80 is an arbitrary function which is everywhere finite .",
    "therefore even at the background naked singularity , the velocity perturbation @xmath40 does not vanish .",
    "this fact means that the type of the singularity formed at the symmetric center @xmath0 is changed from that of the background morgan spacetime . up to the first order of @xmath52 , the ricci scalar is obtained as @xmath81 we can easily find in the above equation that the ricci scalar diverges at the symmetric center @xmath0 if @xmath82 and @xmath40 do not vanish there . thus the background naked _ p.p . _ curvature singularity becomes the _ s.p .",
    "_ curvature singularity which is defined as the spacetime singularity accompanied by the divergence of a scalar polynomial constructed from the riemann tensor@xcite .",
    "using the solution ( [ eq : dust - v - sol ] ) , we can get the solution for @xmath83 . for notational simplicity ,",
    "we introduce a function @xmath84 defined by @xmath85 note that two times @xmath86 is the source term in the equation ( [ eq : r - linear ] ) for @xmath83 .",
    "as mentioned , we search for the solution which can be expressed by maclaurin series in the neighborhood of the background naked singularity as @xmath87 the source function @xmath84 is also assumed to be written by maclaurin series as @xmath88 substituting the above expressions into eq.([eq : r - linear ] ) , we obtain the following equations @xmath89 thus the boundary condition at @xmath0 is given by @xmath90 since the expansion coefficients @xmath91 of the source function are finite , the coefficients @xmath92 are also finite even in the neighborhood of the naked singularity .    the solution for @xmath83 with the boundary condition ( [ eq : r - bc ] )",
    "is easily obtained by constructing a green function .",

    "using eqs.([eq : dust - v - sol ] ) and ( [ eq : source ] ) , the solution is obtained as @xmath107 where @xmath108 is an arbitrary function which is everywhere finite .",
    "in this section , we study the energy carried by gravitational radiation emitted from the naked singularity . since the energy flux in the vacuum region is given by eq.([eq : c - flux - linear ] ) , we numerically calculate @xmath99 in the causal future of the background naked singularity . in order to do so",
    ", we adopt the retarded and advanced coordinates @xmath23 and @xmath44 instead of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
