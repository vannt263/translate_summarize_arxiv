    "<S> then we apply the sb algorithm to study the multifractal property of some classic model networks , such as scale - free networks , small - world networks , and random networks . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that multifractality exists in scale - free networks , that of small - world networks is not obvious , and it almost does not exist in random networks .    </S>",
