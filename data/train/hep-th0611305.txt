    "gauge theories in a slice of anti - de sitter ( ads ) space have attracted a great deal of attention in recent years primarily because they provide geometrical explanations of particle physics mysteries , including the gauge hierarchy problem @xcite , and a window into strongly coupled gauge theories via the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "massless gauge fields propagating in the bulk of ads@xmath0 have been thoroughly examined in the literature @xcite and have many applications ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "it is well - known that the zero mode of this field has a flat profile ( constant wavefunction ) in the extra - dimension , and that the dual theory is described by a ( mostly ) elementary source field interacting with a strongly coupled conformal field theory ( cft ) via a conserved cft current @xcite .",
    "not so familiar is the fact that gauge fields can be localized in the extra dimension , at least for the abelian case @xcite . in order to localize the zero mode , the bulk equation of motion and boundary conditions",
    "must be modified , which is accomplished through the introduction of mass terms in the bulk and on the boundaries . by tuning these masses , a zero mode solution with an exponential profile",
    "is allowed .",
    "the phenomenology and holographic description of localized u(1 ) gauge fields is described in @xcite .",
    "extending this mechanism to the non - abelian case is not so straightforward . in order to preserve four - dimensional ( 4d ) gauge invariance ,",
    "the zero mode cubic and quartic gauge interactions must have the same coupling .",
    "these couplings are proportional to wavefunction overlap integrals , and for exponential zero mode wavefunctions they do not necessarily match . thus it seems the localization mechanism violates 4d gauge invariance .    to have a viable low energy gauge theory , the equality of these couplings must be restored . in this paper we show that this can be achieved by considering interactions on the boundary , which provide the correct contributions to zero mode cubic and quartic terms to force the gauge couplings to be equal .",
    "these interactions can be added to the theory in a gauge invariant way via boundary kinetic terms .",
    "localizing both abelian and non - abelian gauge fields is important for both 5d model building and phenomenology as well as holographic physics . because the gauge field can be localized anywhere in the bulk , an entire new range of parameter space can now be explored .",
    "for example , if the standard model gauge bosons all propagate in the bulk , each field could in principle be localized at different places in the extra dimension .",
    "this may help to alleviate experimental bounds , as in the u(1 ) case , and could perhaps lead to novel model building scenarios .",
    "perhaps more interesting is the notion that if zero modes are localized near the infrared boundary , there may exist a dual theory in which the gauge fields are composite cft states . in this case , the dual gauge theory would be a valid effective field theory below the cutoff corresponding to the scale of conformal symmetry breaking .",
    "our approach is not without a few caveats that need to be addressed .",
    "first , a particular boundary kinetic term must be added to restore the gauge invariance at the nonlinear level .",
    "this represents an additional tuning beyond the tuning already required between bulk and boundary masses ( as well as the tuning between bulk and boundary cosmological constants in the original randall - sundrum model ! ) .",
    "more importantly , mass terms in the 5d theory must be generated through spontaneous symmetry breaking if we hope to preserve a 4d gauge symmetry .",
    "therefore , we must also account for the additional scalar fields present in the theory .",
    "these scalar fields complicate the analysis and may also introduce more severe problems , such as ghosts or strong coupling . although we are not able to offer a general analysis of these scalar issues , we present some simple examples illustrating the problems and speculate on possible resolutions .",
    "even if these issues can only be resolved in the uv completion of the model the nice features of the yang - mills localization will still be preserved at low energies and therefore makes the present study relevant .",
    "we also compare our approach to other methods of localizing gauge fields on the brane .",
    "as first shown in @xcite , gauge fields can be given a localized wavefunction through a dilatonic coupling .",
    "a similar mechanism is also motivated by deconstruction , in which the 4d gauge theories have nonuniversal gauge couplings at each site @xcite .",
    "these approaches share many of the features of our method , but there are also differences , which we point out .    the scalar component @xmath1 is also utilized in models of electroweak symmetry breaking as an alternative to the higgs boson @xcite . the zero mode profile of this field is restricted by gauge invariance .",
    "however , we show that like the vector @xmath2 , it is possible to change the profile , and thus localize the @xmath1 zero mode anywhere in the bulk . this could affect the phenomenology of gauge - higgs unification models in novel ways .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we begin by reviewing how the addition of bulk and boundary mass terms allow for a localized zero mode gauge field .",
    "we then move on to the full non - abelian analysis , showing how boundary kinetic terms , if appropriately tuned , can restore 4d gauge invariance . in section 3",
    "we discuss the additional scalar fields in the theory .",
    "we present a flat space analysis of the nambu - goldstone bosons associated with the massive vectors in the 4d theory .",
    "we also discuss the possibility of strong coupling and ghosts by considering a simple example containing only boundary masses ( no bulk masses ) . in section 4",
    "we review other methods of gauge field localization , including localization with a dilaton and via deconstruction , and compare these methods with our approach .",
    "we discuss the localization of the scalar @xmath1 in section 5 .",
    "finally we conclude in section 6 , and suggest possible directions for future investigation .",
    "we will work with the following metric describing 5d anti - de sitter space : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the extra coordinate and @xmath5 is the curvature scale related to the bulk cosmological constant .",
    "the fifth dimension @xmath4 is compactified on a @xmath6 orbifold and two three - branes are located at the orbifold fixed points @xmath7 and @xmath8 , referred to as the ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) brane , respectively .",
    "the indices of 5d coordinates are labeled with latin letters ( @xmath9,@xmath10 , @xmath11 ) while 4d indices are labeled by greek letters ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath11 ) .",
    "all 4d indices are raised and lowered with the minkowski metric @xmath14 .",
    "it is well - known that massless gauge fields propagating on the background ( [ adsmetric ] ) lead to a massless zero mode that is not localized in the extra dimension , but rather has a flat profile @xcite . instead to localize a zero mode , bulk and boundary mass terms must be added which modify both the bulk equation of motion and the boundary conditions for the gauge field @xcite .",
    "the massless mode then has an exponential profile and can be localized anywhere in the bulk .",
    "we will show how this is accomplished in section 2.1 . of course",
    "such mass terms must be generated in a gauge invariant way , so that a 4d gauge symmetry is preserved for the zero mode .",
    "the most obvious way to generate such terms is by the spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry .",
    "this introduces extra scalar fields into the theory which may cause problems .",
    "for instance , if massless scalar modes persist in the 4d theory they may be undesirable for model building .",
    "other , more severe problems , such as the existence of ghosts or strongly coupled light scalar fields , may also occur .",
    "we will discuss these issues in section 3 .",
    "however , the gauge sector can be isolated from the scalar sector , and none of these more severe problems exist for the gauge field .",
    "a separate issue arises when we consider the localization of non - abelian gauge fields . as we will see in this section ,",
    "the zero mode cubic and quartic couplings do not match , and thus the conventional 4d gauge symmetry does not exist in the simplest formulation .",
    "the effective couplings are proportional to the overlap integral of the wavefunctions , and are only equal when the zero mode is flat . to remedy this",
    ", we will add cubic and quartic interactions on the branes which will restore the equality of the zero mode gauge couplings .",
    "the only way this can be done while preserving gauge invariance is by adding a kinetic term to the brane , which we show in section 2.2 .",
    "we study only pure yang - mills theory in this paper .",
    "however , if fermions propagate in the bulk , we can generalize the mechanism and restore 4d gauge invariance by adding gauge covariant boundary kinetic terms for fermions .",
    "we begin by briefly reviewing how to localize the zero mode gauge field in the extra dimension . for simplicity we will consider a u(1 ) gauge field , since the generalization to the non - abelian case is straightforward at the quadratic level in the action .",
    "consider the following 5d equation of motion for a spin-1 field @xmath15 : @xmath16 the mass term arises from spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite and contains both bulk and boundary terms : @xmath17 where we have defined @xmath18 .",
    "the bulk and boundary masses are written in terms of the ads curvature @xmath5 with dimensionless parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , we must tune the parameters , @xmath21 to allow a zero mode solution .",
    "only real values for the mass parameters , @xmath22 , are considered and therefore @xmath20 can take any real value .",
    "let us choose the gauge @xmath23 for simplicity .",
    "the equation of motion ( [ eom1 ] ) becomes @xmath24a_\\mu(x , y)=0~. \\label{eom2}\\ ] ] decomposing the vector @xmath2 as @xmath25 the solution of ( [ eom2 ] ) for the massless mode is @xmath26 since @xmath20 can be any real number ( [ tune ] ) , the zero mode can be localized anywhere in the fifth dimension .    to see the necessity of tuning the parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 , note",
    "the boundary condition derived by integrating the equation of motion ( [ eom2 ] ) across the boundary is @xmath27 the zero mode satisfies this equation only if the relation ( [ tune ] ) holds . otherwise , the boundary conditions project out the massless mode .",
    "it is possible that this tuning is enforced in a supersymmetric extension , as happens for bulk scalar fields @xcite .    to summarize , the bulk mass term changes the profile of the zero mode from flat to exponential .",
    "clearly , an exponential wavefunction is incompatible with ordinary dirichlet or neumann conditions .",
    "the brane - localized mass modifies the boundary condition to be compatible with this exponential wavefunction .",
    "furthermore , this leads to interesting phenomenological possibilities and remarkably the localized u(1 ) gauge bosons can be given a holographic interpretation  @xcite .",
    "let us now consider the following action for a non - abelian gauge field @xmath28 in a slice of ads@xmath0 : @xmath29~ , \\label{a1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the field strength tensor is defined as @xmath30 with group structure constants @xmath31 and 5d coupling @xmath32 .",
    "again , the mass term is assumed to be generated by spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "the technique described in the previous section can also be applied to localizing non - abelian gauge fields . at the quadratic level ,",
    "the equation of motion is the same as in the abelian case , and therefore the procedure is identical .",
    "however , when we examine the nonlinear terms of the yang - mills theory to compute the zero mode cubic and quartic interactions , we find that the couplings do not match .",
    "thus it seems that there is no longer any 4d gauge invariance .",
    "it is possible to restore the zero mode cubic and quartic couplings consistent with 4d gauge invariance if we consider brane - localized interactions .",
    "these terms play a similar role to the boundary mass terms , which cancels the bulk mass contribution to the zero mode action .",
    "we can not add these terms by hand to the boundary action without violating gauge invariance . to preserve the symmetry",
    ", we must add a boundary kinetic term , so that the action becomes @xmath33 . \\label{a2}\\ ] ] note the boundary term is suppressed by @xmath34 relative to the bulk term .",
    "it will be necessary to tune the dimensionless coefficient @xmath35 to match the zero mode couplings .",
    "for simplicity , we have chosen the same coupling on each brane , but it is possible to have them different , which we will discuss at the end of this section .    also notice that one of the kinetic terms has a negative coefficient and therefore could introduce a ghost into the theory . however , it is the sum of the bulk and boundary kinetic energies which is important .",
    "when we perform the kaluza - klein reduction , we will require the wavefunction overlap integral , including the bulk and boundary terms , to be positive , which then implies the particle has positive energy .",
    "we will see that this requirement is satisfied for all values of @xmath35 that we will consider .",
    "in fact negative boundary kinetic terms have been previously considered in the literature . in ref .",
    "@xcite the effect of brane kinetic terms in the randall - sundrum model was studied and it was found that a ghost does indeed appear in the spectrum , but only if one of the boundary terms is made so strong and negative that it overwhelms the positive energy contributions from the bulk and other boundary .",
    "similar conclusions were drawn in ref .",
    "@xcite where negative kinetic terms in flat space were examined .",
    "thus , it seems from the 4d effective field theory vantage point , negative boundary kinetic terms in principle pose no problem to model building .",
    "however , note that this cancellation mechanism is nonlocal since locally there is always a negative kinetic term .    with this modification to the action ,",
    "the equation of motion at quadratic level is @xmath36a_\\mu(x , y)=0~. \\label{eom4}\\ ] ] decomposing the field ( [ kk ] ) and demanding @xmath37 the equation of motion for the eigenfunction @xmath38 becomes @xmath39f^n(y)=-e^{2ky}m_n^2\\left(1+\\frac{\\beta}{k^2}\\sigma''(y)\\right)~. \\label{eom5}\\ ] ] the bulk equation of motion is unaffected by the presence of the boundary term , but the boundary condition is now altered : @xmath40 the massive modes are influenced by the brane kinetic term and thus the spectrum will be modified . however , the boundary condition for the massless mode @xmath41 is the same as in the abelian case ( [ bc1 ] ) , and therefore the zero mode can be localized provided we demand the tuning condition ( [ tune ] ) .",
    "the normalized zero mode solution is given by @xmath42 note that for a flat zero mode ( @xmath43 ) , the normalization is unaffected by the presence of the brane - localized kinetic term since the wavefunction has the same value at each boundary .",
    "the normalization @xmath44 must be real , or equivalently the overlap integral ( [ normal ] ) must be positive so that the field is not ghostlike .",
    "thus , we must require that @xmath45 .",
    "we will see shortly that this limit is always satisfied if we require that a 4d gauge invariance be preserved for the zero mode .",
    "the interaction terms following from the action ( [ a2 ] ) are @xmath46~. \\label{int1}\\ ] ] localizing a massless mode comes at a price : the loss of _ 4d gauge invariance _ of the zero mode . without boundary interaction terms",
    ", the cubic and quartic vertices will have different strengths .",
    "the 5d symmetry may still be realized in the effective theory , but it will not take the standard form familiar in 4d theories .",
    "the gauge invariance can be restored if we add a boundary kinetic term with a precise coefficient ( [ a2 ] ) .",
    "let us investigate the effective 4d interactions and see the problem and its resolution explicitly .",
    "inserting the zero mode wavefunction ( [ wf ] ) into ( [ int1 ] ) , the couplings can be calculated by performing the overlap integrals .",
    "the cubic coupling is given by : @xmath47 while the quartic coupling is @xmath48 clearly for @xmath49 , @xmath50 and the 4d gauge symmetry is lost for general values of @xmath20 .",
    "thus we see the necessity of including a boundary kinetic term for nonzero @xmath20 .",
    "only when the mode is flat ( @xmath43 ) are the couplings identical . moreover , when the mode is flat arbitrary boundary kinetic terms ( with different coefficients ) may be added to the action without affecting the zero mode gauge invariance .",
    "we will demand that a 4d gauge symmetry be present in the theory for general values of @xmath20 , or in other words , we will require that @xmath51 . to find the value of @xmath35 that satisfies this requirement",

    "for any particular value of the localization parameter @xmath20 , there are two possible boundary kinetic terms that will preserve 4d gauge invariance , with strength @xmath58 or @xmath59 .",
    "the @xmath58 and @xmath59 branches are continuously connected at @xmath43 and this behavior is plotted in fig .",

    "the @xmath62 and @xmath63 branches are continuously connected at @xmath43 corresponding to a constant zero mode wavefunction . at @xmath43 , @xmath35 can take any value . ]",
    "it is instructive to study two limiting cases . for small values of @xmath20 , we find that the coefficient @xmath35 becomes @xmath64 this equation seems to imply that for the flat mode ( @xmath43 ) , we must also include boundary kinetic terms to maintain 4d gauge invariance .",
    "of course this is not true .",
    "the presence of boundary kinetic terms has no effect on the 4d gauge invariance when the mode is flat , which can easily be seen , for example , from the wavefunction overlap integrals that determine the 4d couplings , eqs .",
    "( [ cubic ] ) and ( [ quartic ] ) .",
    "the boundary terms simply cancel when the wavefunction is constant . in the more generic case of different coefficients for each brane - localized kinetic term ,",
    "the zero mode couplings are still equal .",
    "we can also study the limit where @xmath65 , in which case the coefficient @xmath35 reduces to @xmath66 we see that either a very small or very large boundary kinetic term must be added to restore gauge invariance in the low energy theory .",
    "now we turn to the effective 4d gauge couplings , which are computed by inserting ( [ beta ] ) back into ( [ quartic ] ) .",
    "the couplings can also take two possible values depending on which boundary kinetic term ( @xmath58 or @xmath59 ) is chosen .",
    "this is shown clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] with @xmath67 plotted as a function of @xmath20 in units of @xmath68 .",
    "plotted ( in units of @xmath68 ) as a function of @xmath20 for @xmath69 . for any given value of @xmath20",
    "there are two characteristic behaviors , the @xmath59 branch ( dashed line ) , and the @xmath58 branch ( solid line ) .",
    "the @xmath62 and @xmath63 branches are continuously connected at @xmath43 . ]",
    "the two branches are again connected at @xmath43 , in which case the 4d gauge coupling becomes the familiar @xmath70 . for large @xmath57",
    "the gauge coupling on the @xmath59 branch is approximately @xmath71 notice that a large value of @xmath72 is required to obtain a 4d gauge coupling of order one and therefore perturbativity of the 5d gauge theory does not allow for arbitrary localization on the @xmath59 branch . on the other hand for the @xmath58 branch ( shown as the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , the gauge coupling for highly localized modes ( @xmath73 ) becomes : @xmath74 in this case a 4d gauge coupling of order one for large @xmath57 can always be obtained for perturbative values of the 5d gauge coupling .",
    "thus , for extremely localized zero modes , only the @xmath58 branch is consistent with perturbativity for all large values of @xmath57 . for weak localization where @xmath75 , a 4d coupling of order one can be defined for both branches . as @xmath57 becomes of order unity and the mode",
    "is localized , only the @xmath58 branch would be consistent with perturbative values of @xmath68 .",
    "finally , let us verify that the zero mode is not a ghost for all values of @xmath35 . at the end of section 2.2 we found that @xmath76 , otherwise @xmath77 has negative kinetic energy and is ghostlike . from eq .",
    "( [ beta - largealpha ] ) we see that the maximum value of @xmath78 is @xmath79 which occurs for very large values of @xmath57 on the @xmath58 branch .",
    "thus we see that the limit is always satisfied and the zero mode has positive energy .",
    "notice that in our approach , there are two relations that must be tuned : 1 ) the bulk and boundary masses must satisfy relation ( [ tune ] ) to permit a zero mode solution consistent with boundary conditions , and 2 ) a precise boundary kinetic term ( one on each brane ) with a coefficient given by ( [ beta ] ) , which is related to the boundary mass @xmath20 must be added to the action . of course",
    ", all of these parameters will receive quantum corrections , and therefore these relations are inherently radiatively unstable .",
    "this question will not be addressed in this paper and we simply assume that the tuning is enforced in the underlying theory to cancel any quantum effects that leads to deviations in the tunings .",
    "one might hope that there is some symmetry which could enforce the tuning relations .",
    "one possibility is supersymmetry .",
    "similar bulk and boundary mass relations for scalar fields are demanded by supersymmetry @xcite , and it is not unrealistic to think that the same thing could happen for gauge fields .",
    "however there are no known examples where boundary kinetic terms are demanded by supersymmetry , so it remains an unanswered question whether the second tuning will be enforced by any symmetry .",
    "let us briefly discuss the possibility of having different kinetic terms on the uv and ir brane , with strengths @xmath80 and @xmath81 . modifying the action ( [ a2 ] )",
    "@xmath82 , \\label{adiff}\\ ] ] we can follow the procedure outlined in section 2.2 and compute the zero mode wavefunction and cubic and quartic couplings .",
    "demanding that the couplings are equal gives a constraint on the allowed @xmath35 values .",
    "for a given localization @xmath20 , we can choose , say , @xmath81 and then compute @xmath80 in terms of @xmath20 and @xmath81 .",
    "we must also demand that the normalization of the zero mode wavefunction is real ; otherwise the zero mode will be a ghost .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for the case @xmath83 .     and @xmath81 for the case @xmath83 , indicated by the solid line .",
    "the shaded region indicates the @xmath35 values which produce a zero mode ghost , and are thus not allowed .",
    "the line @xmath84 is also shown ( dotted line ) , and the @xmath58 and @xmath59 branches are also indicated . ]    notice that it is not possible to have two positive kinetic terms ; at least one must be negative .",
    "this implies that for high energy processes , locally the kinetic term will appear to be negative , and the theory will have a ghost . at large distances ,",
    "the nonlocal effects of both brane terms combine to form a perfectly sensible effective field theory , so long as the boundary terms are not so strong and negative that they overwhelm the positive bulk contribution .",
    "the shaded region indicates where this happens ; the negative ( and large ) brane kinetic terms produce a zero mode ghostlike gauge field .",
    "note also the case @xmath84 studied in the previous section lies in the ghost - free region .    the structure of this plot is similar for different values of the localization parameter @xmath20 . as we localize the zero mode towards the ir brane ( increasing @xmath20 ) the asymptote moves towards , but never reaches , the @xmath4-axis .",
    "instead localizing the massless mode towards the uv brane ( decreasing @xmath20 ) , causes the asymptote to move further away towards large negative values .",
    "the qualitative behavior of the allowed values for @xmath80 and @xmath81 is the same in these cases . in particular , it is never possible to have both brane kinetic terms positive , and there is always a region where the brane kinetic terms produce a zero mode ghost .",
    "to localize a massless gauge field in the bulk , we found that it was necessary to add mass terms in the bulk and on the boundary .",
    "if we simply add a hard mass term which breaks the 5d gauge symmetry , there is no hope of recovering a 4d gauge symmetry in the effective theory .",
    "thus , it is necessary to generate the mass term through spontaneous symmetry breaking , i.e. a higgs mechanism . thus localizing a gauge field in this approach",
    "comes at the price of introducing additional scalar fields in the theory .",
    "these additional scalars complicate the analysis and obscure the 4d gauge symmetry compared to the case of a massless 5d bulk gauge field , in which the 4d symmetry is realized in a rather simple way . in that case , the scalar mode @xmath85 is the nambu - goldstone boson which is eaten by the massive vector @xmath86 @xcite . with additional scalar fields ,",
    "the nambu - goldstone boson will be a particular linear combination of scalar fields , while another combination will be a physical scalar degree of freedom .",
    "although the analysis is complicated in warped space , we illustrate this feature with a flat space example in section 3.1 .",
    "more pressing is the possibility that these scalar modes may be massless , strongly coupled , or even ghostlike .",
    "we discuss these issues in section 3.2 using a simple example in warped space with only boundary masses .",
    "we find that natural boundary conditions allow a zero mode physical scalar field to exist . to preserve the gauge symmetry a boundary mass term for the vector @xmath2",
    "necessarily contains a scalar kinetic term .",
    "when the bulk and boundary mass parameters are tuned to cancel the zero mode mass , we might then expect that the zero mode scalar kinetic term is canceled or even becomes negative , corresponding to a strong coupling problem or a ghostlike state , respectively .",
    "although we find no ghost in this example , the physical scalar zero modes are generically strongly coupled .",
    "it seems likely that a different choice of boundary conditions ( e.g. dirichlet ) will eliminate the scalar zero mode , but the general analysis is then complicated , as we will discuss . in this section our discussion is limited to the abelian case for simplicity , but of course similar issues will be faced in non - abelian extensions .",
    "let us revisit the abelian case , and consider the 5d action for the gauge field @xmath15 with bulk mass @xmath87 and the 5d nambu - goldstone boson @xmath88 which appears after spontaneous symmetry breaking : @xmath89~ , \\label{a3}\\ ] ] where we have only included quadratic terms in the lagrangian involving @xmath90 and @xmath91 . from a 5d point of view",
    ", @xmath91 is the nambu - goldstone boson which gives a mass to the vector @xmath90 .",
    "however when we compactify the extra dimension , the modes @xmath85 will play some role in giving the 4d vectors @xmath92 a mass @xmath93 .",
    "we might then expect that it is some combination of modes @xmath94 and @xmath95 which form the true nambu - goldstone boson for @xmath92 , while the orthogonal combination is a physical scalar particle .",
    "previously we did not take into account the nambu - goldstone boson which couples to @xmath2 at the quadratic level in the action .",
    "here we show that it is indeed possible to isolate @xmath2 by defining @xmath96 gauges . by separating the action ( [ a3 ] ) into components",

    "we can remove the mixing in the @xmath2 sector by adding a gauge fixing term @xmath100 ^ 2~. \\label{lgf}\\ ] ] the bulk equation of motion ( [ eom2 ] ) then follows if we choose the unitary gauge given by @xmath101 . with boundary mass terms",
    "there will also be terms involving @xmath91 in the boundary action that mix with @xmath2 .",
    "this mixing can be removed in a similar manner by gauge fixing , except that in this case there will be terms proportional to delta - functions . still the vector @xmath2 can be isolated and its equation of motion can be analyzed straightforwardly as in section 2.1 .",
    "ideally , we would like to decompose the action ( [ a4 ] ) in order to see how the 5d symmetry manifests itself in the kaluza - klein action ( i.e. identify the nambu - goldstone boson ) , as is done with massless gauge fields @xcite . in warped space ,",
    "however , it is unclear how to decompose the fields since they obey different equations of motion .",

    ", these other approaches to gauge field localization may provide simpler models , in particular with regard to the scalar sector , which we have seen in our approach is quite difficult to analyze in a satisfactory way .",
    "let us begin by reviewing the basic idea considered in @xcite .",
    "the theory consists of 5d gravity coupled to a scalar field @xmath165 .",
    "the scalar @xmath165 acquires a bounce - like configuration , which can be idealized to a `` brane '' by taking a particular limit in the scalar potential .",
    "rs2-like solutions appear for the metric in this brane limit .",
    "if we introduce another scalar , the dilaton @xmath166 , it also acquires a nontrivial background , which in the brane limit turns out to be linear in @xmath4 , @xmath167 , where @xmath168 is a dimensionless constant .",
    "in fact if we simply begin with a brane , that is , without reference to the field @xmath165 , we still find a linear dilaton solution @xcite . in these cases",
    ", however , the dilaton @xmath166 back - reacts on the geometry , which is modified from pure ads@xmath0 . in our discussion below , we will assume the geometry is pure ads@xmath0 to compare with our model , even though we know of no 5d model with a linear dilaton solution and pure ads@xmath0 geometry .",
    "following @xcite , we can easily see how the gauge field is localized .",
    "consider the following action of a massless gauge field coupled to a dilaton @xmath166 , expanded about its background configuration : @xmath169~,\\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\int d^5x~ e^{-2 b k y}\\left[-\\frac{1}{4}f_{\\mu\\nu}f^{\\mu\\nu}-\\frac{1}{2}e^{-2 k y } ( \\partial_5 a_\\mu-\\partial_\\mu a_5)^2 \\right]~. \\label{a5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] performing a kaluza - klein decomposition as in ( [ kk ] ) , the solution for the massless mode is a constant , @xmath170 .",
    "the zero mode action can then be written as @xmath171~.\\ ] ] the profile of the gauge boson with respect to a flat metric is then seen to be @xmath172 . the coupling to the dilaton simply becomes the gauge boson wavefunction when the dilaton acquires a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",

    "the relation of the coefficients of these mass terms is precisely the one necessary to force a localized massless mode , which can easily be seen by identifying @xmath178 and @xmath179 , in which case the tuning relation ( [ tune ] ) holds . again",
    "the wavefunction is given by @xmath180 .",
    "notice that in this model @xcite , there is only one brane , so that the wavefunction is normalizable only if @xmath168 is positive .",
    "why ca nt we simply start from the action ( [ a6 ] ) , and demand the strange gauge symmetry ( [ gauge ] ) without ever referring to the dilaton @xmath166 ? this would allow us to have a theory with a localized gauge field and _ no _ extra scalar fields .",
    "we can do this , but there are a couple of objections to this approach .",
    "the action ( [ a6 ] ) explicitly violates 5d lorentz invariance in the bulk .",
    "of course the dilatonic action ( [ a5 ] ) appears to violate the symmetry as well , but this is only because the vev of the dilaton spontaneously breaks lorentz invariance , and the symmetry is therefore realized non - linearly through fluctuations about the background . if we do nt have this extra scalar , then the theory breaks 5d lorentz invariance . on the other hand ,",
    "4d lorentz invariance is a symmetry of the action ( [ a6 ] ) , which is the only symmetry we need for phenomenological purposes .",
    "another objection , of course , would be that the unorthodox gauge symmetry in ( [ gauge ] ) would seem a bit unnatural if we did nt know about its origin from the dilaton coupling .",
    "it is a local symmetry nonetheless , indicating a redundancy in the description of the physical degrees of freedom in the system .      the pure action ( [ a6 ] ) without a dilaton finds a stronger motivation through deconstruction as shown in @xcite .",
    "in this section we will review this approach and mention some of the advantages of the deconstruction viewpoint .",
    "consider @xmath44 sites each with an su@xmath181 gauge theory .",
    "the sites are connected by bifundamental scalar fields @xmath182 .",
    "the 4d lagrangian is then @xmath183 where the covariant derivative is defined as @xmath184 .",
    "the gauge symmetry is broken to a diagonal su@xmath185 by assuming that the scalar fields acquire vevs proportional to the unit matrix , @xmath186 .",

    "this gives a flat zero mode gauge field .",

    "what is appealing about the deconstruction approach to localizing the gauge field is that there is no reference to a dilaton .",
    "the fluctuations about the vacuum @xmath195 are related in the continuum to @xmath1 , and no other scalar field is present in the theory . indeed , after taking into account these fluctuations , the full action is given by ( [ a6 ] ) .",
    "the zero mode localization is simply a consequence of different gauge theories @xmath196 having different couplings @xmath197 , which is certainly allowed .",
    "the absence of the dilaton is much like the absence of the radion in generic deconstructed theories compared to their full five dimensional counterparts .",
    "the approaches to localizing gauge fields described in the previous section seem very similar to our approach .",
    "the localized wavefunction can be ascribed to a dilaton coupling in a nontrivial background , or to a position dependent gauge coupling . upon a field redefinition , bulk and boundary masses",
    "appear with precisely the right coefficients necessary to localize a zero mode , identical to ( [ mass ] ) .",
    "these observations were first made in @xcite .",
    "although the technical details of each approach are similar , the philosophy behind each is somewhat different .",
    "we are beginning with a pure gauge theory in a slice of ads@xmath0 , and attempting to generate the necessary mass terms through the spontaneous breaking of the symmetry .",
    "the 5d bulk lorentz symmetry is never broken . in the other approaches ,",
    "the localized wavefunction is generated through an auxiliary mechanism , either the dilaton profile or a position dependent coupling , and is crucially dependent on breaking 5d lorentz invariance in the bulk .",
    "moreover , it remains to be shown whether there exists a solution to einstein s equations that produces a linear dilaton background with pure ads@xmath0 geometry .",
    "the number of additional physical scalar particles in each theory is different as well . in our approach ,",
    "the number of scalar fields depends on the representation of the symmetry group in which scalar fields reside , and this number could be quite large .",
    "the analysis of these scalars is also complicated since there is mixing at the quadratic level in the action , and can in principle lead to strong coupling problems in the theory , as elaborated on in section 3 . on the other hand , in order to localize the field with a dilaton , only one scalar is needed per gauge field @xmath90 .",
    "fluctuations about the dilaton background in ( [ a5 ] ) need to be studied , but the analysis should be simpler because these perturbations will not mix with the gauge field at the quadratic level , but only appear as interactions .",
    "on the other hand , the deconstructed approach is even simpler because there are no additional scalar fields , although the continuum theory explicitly breaks 5d lorentz symmetry .    at the non - abelian level , these approaches really diverge .",
    "we found it necessary to add brane - localized kinetic terms to restore the equality of the zero mode gauge couplings .",
    "the other approaches accomplish this by having position dependent couplings . to see this , consider the non - abelian generalization of ( [ a5 ] ) . to compare with our approach ,",

    ", we find that the 4d cubic and quartic couplings are equal , and thus the low energy theory is gauge invariant . in our approach , the 5d gauge couplings are constant in the bulk",
    ".    the phenomenology of each localization mechanism would also be different . in our approach , brane kinetic terms",
    "must be included , which can drastically alter the mass spectrum , wavefunctions , and couplings to matter , as illustrated by a number of studies @xcite .",
    "brane kinetic terms are not necessary in the other approaches , but of course may be included for study . finally , the scalar content of each theory is much different , which would affect the phenomenology .",
    "although we have focused on the gauge field @xmath2 in this paper , many models utilize the @xmath1 field in one way or another .",
    "one well known example is the hosotani mechanism @xcite , or radiative symmetry breaking , where quantum corrections induce a mass for the zero - mode @xmath139 , which is then identified as the higgs boson .",
    "a recent twist on this idea , motivated by holography , are composite higgs models @xcite , where the dual of the @xmath1 is a composite pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson of a strongly coupled theory .",
    "the ability to localize the @xmath1 field in these contexts could have interesting effects on the phenomenology of these models .    with a massless 5d gauge boson in the bulk",

    "this field goes against the philosophy of the gauge - higgs models where @xmath1 is to be used as an _ alternative _ to spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "hence , we will show how the @xmath1 can be localized either through a dilaton coupling , or through deconstruction , similar to the case for @xmath2 in section 4 .",

    "note that this agrees with the zero mode localization of a pure bulk scalar with bulk mass @xmath214 and boundary mass @xmath215  @xcite .",
    "zero mode gauge fields in a compact extra dimension can be localized through the addition of bulk and brane mass terms .",
    "the inclusion of these terms modifies the bulk equation of motion and the boundary conditions such that a zero mode with an exponential wavefunction exists in the theory . in the non - abelian case , however , the cubic and quartic couplings of this zero mode are not equal , meaning that the gauge symmetry of the 4d theory is lost .",
    "we have shown how to recover the 4d gauge symmetry by adding gauge interactions on the boundaries . in this way",
    "the sum of the bulk plus boundary contributions to the interactions of the zero mode restores the equality of the gauge couplings , and then the 4d gauge invariance appears in its usual form .",
    "we can add these brane interactions in a gauge invariant way via brane - localized kinetic terms .",
    "one caveat in this approach is that there are two relations in this theory that must be tuned , one between the bulk and boundary masses to produce a localized massless mode wavefunction , and another between kinetic terms and the boundary mass parameter .",
    "furthermore even though the zero mode had overall positive kinetic energy , via a nonlocal cancellation mechanism , negative kinetic energy terms were required on at least one brane .",
    "these terms would need to be resolved in any sensible uv completion of the model .",
    "there are also caveats related to the additional scalar fields that must be present in the theory . to add mass terms in the bulk and on the boundary in a gauge invariant way",
    ", the terms must be generated by breaking the 5d gauge symmetry , which necessitates introducing additional scalar fields in the theory . in the warped case ,",
    "a complete analysis of these extra scalars is limited because of the nontrivial mixing .",
    "we have instead presented this analysis in flat space , where the eigenfunctions of the different fields are similar .",
    "if one could extend this analysis to the warped case , many of the scalar issues , such as strong coupling , could be addressed more generally .",
    "we have shown , however , that in the warped case with only boundary masses , a strong coupling problem may exist in the scalar sector .",
    "this problem may be resolved by a different choice of boundary conditions or by radiative corrections to the scalar zero mode mass .    even if the problems of the scalar sector can not be addressed without a more fundamental uv description , the yang - mills localization will still be preserved at low energies .",
    "the phenomenology of localized gauge fields in the randall - sundrum model would therefore be interesting to explore . if we consider the standard model in the bulk , then",
    "each gauge boson can in principle be localized at different points in the extra dimension .",
    "gauge fields in the bulk were originally considered in @xcite , and it was found that the mass of the first kaluza - klein excitation must be pushed to a rather high scale to suppress four - fermion operators . however , localizing gauge fields can help lower the kaluza - klein mass scale , as illustrated in the abelian case @xcite .",
    "it is conceivable that localizing gauge fields could have other phenomenological benefits .",
    "also , the phenomenology would be different depending on the localization mechanism , either bulk and boundary masses , dilaton coupling , or deconstruction .",
    "perhaps the most interesting aspect of localized gauge fields is the holographic interpretation @xcite .",
    "if the zero mode is localized on the uv brane , we find that the massless particle in the dual theory is primarily an elementary field external to the cft . on the other hand , a zero mode localized on the ir brane corresponds in the dual theory to a composite massless gauge field built out of cft states .",
    "for example , if we consider the standard model gauge fields propagating in the bulk with zero modes localized towards the ir brane , then in the dual theory the forces that we experience - electromagnetic , weak , and strong - are really emergent phenomena , a result of strongly coupled ( unknown ) cft dynamics at low energy .",
    "this is similar to the emergent gravity scenario considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , and adding boundary kinetic terms for gravity as done for non - abelian gauge fields in this paper , suggests a similar nonlinear extension for gravity .    finally , we discussed the localization of the @xmath1 field , the scalar component of the 5d gauge field .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to localize this field anywhere in the bulk with a dilaton coupling or via deconstruction .",
    "this opens up new phenomenological possibilities in models where @xmath1 is the pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking .",

    "<S> we present a mechanism to localize zero mode non - abelian gauge fields in a slice of ads@xmath0 . as in the u(1 ) case , bulk and boundary mass terms allow for a massless mode with an exponential profile that can be localized anywhere in the bulk . however in the non - abelian extension , the cubic and quartic zero mode gauge couplings do not match , implying a loss of 4d gauge invariance . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the symmetry can be restored at the nonlinear level by considering brane - localized interactions , which are added in a gauge invariant way using boundary kinetic terms . </S>",
    "<S> possible issues related to the scalar sector of the theory , such as strong coupling and ghosts , are also discussed . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is then compared with other localization mechanisms motivated by dilaton gravity and deconstruction . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show how to localize the scalar component @xmath1 zero mode anywhere in the bulk which could be relevant in gauge - higgs unification models .    </S>",
