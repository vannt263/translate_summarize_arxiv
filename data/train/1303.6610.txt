    "unusual properties of liquid crystal elastomers ( lce ) arise from a coupling between the liquid crystalline ordering of mesogenic molecules and the elasticity of the underlying polymer network .",
    "crosslinked networks of polymer chains of a lce include mesogenic units which either belong to the polymer backbone ( main - chain lce ) or to side units pendent to the backbone ( side - chain lce )  @xcite .",
    "the shape of a monodomain nematic lce strongly depends on the temperature dependent nematic order parameter @xmath0 .",
    "this connection is a consequence of the coupling of @xmath0 with the average polymer chain anisotropy . by increasing the temperature of a lce ,",
    "@xmath0 decreases which leads to a decrease of the polymer backbone anisotropy .",
    "this decrease of anisotropy manifests itself as an uniaxial contraction of the lce sample .",
    "mechanical change can be realized also through a change of nematic order by other means . as first shown in lces by finkelmann _",
    "et al_.  @xcite , changes can also be achieved by introducing photo - isomerizable groups ( e.g. azobenzene ) into their chemical structure .",
    "these structures will be referred to as nematic photo - elastomers . by absorbing a photon ,",
    "azobenzene dye molecules can make transitions , with a quantum efficiency @xmath1 , from their linear ( _ trans _ ) ground state to the excited bent - shaped ( _ cis _ ) state .",
    "while the rodlike _ trans _ molecules contribute to the overall nematic order , the bent _ cis _ molecules act as impurities which reduce the nematic order parameter and lower the nematic - isotropic transition temperature .",
    "the illumination of photo - elastomers causes the reduction of nematic order , which in turn produces an uniaxial contraction of the sample . on switching off the irradiation",
    ", the nematic order parameter recovers its initial dark state value , which results in a macroscopic expansion of the sample .",
    "the characteristic time of the mechanical response of the sample is in the rather wide range of milliseconds  @xcite to hours  @xcite . to see whether slow on - response in  @xcite was caused by a slow polymer dynamics of the nematic elastomer , or by a slow photo - isomerization kinetics ,",
    "experiments were done  @xcite on clamped photo - elastomers .",
    "contrary to the case of the measurements on a freely suspended sample , the clamped setting requires no physical movement of chains in the network . in such settings the sample is fixed at both ends of its longest dimension ( along the nematic director ) .",
    "then , upon irradiation the sample can not shrink and a retractive force is exerted on the clamps  see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for an illustration .",
    "this force is measured as a function of time until the photo - stationary state is reached .",
    "on switching off the irradiation the relaxation of the force begins .",
    "it was first observed by cviklinski _",
    "et al_.  @xcite that the dynamics of the nematic order parameter matches the dynamics of the mechanical response meaning that the rate - limiting process is dominantly the photo - isomerization .",
    "they also found that their systems display simple exponential processes for the build up of and decay of force .",
    "subsequently , it has been shown in other systems  @xcite that the stress  temperature experimental data for the on - process can be approximately fitted to a simple stretched exponential form @xmath2 $ ] , where @xmath3 is the normalized stress exerted on the clamps ( stress at time @xmath4 divided by the photostationary stress ) , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are fit parameters .",
    "similarly , it was found that the normalized stress in the off - process can be fitted to the nearly exponential law @xmath7 $ ] , where @xmath8 .",
    "such complex dynamical response can not be attributed ( as is usual ) to polymer dynamics since we have clamping . in this paper",
    "we show that these findings can in fact be successfully described by our simple model of photodynamics and its conversion into stress in clamped nematic elastomers .",
    "according to the beer law of light absorption the light propagating in a thick absorbing sample is attenuated at constant rate .",
    "the light intensity at a depth @xmath9 into the sample is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the incident intensity , and @xmath12 is the characteristic penetration depth of a given material due to absorption by _ trans _ isomers .",
    "however , it has been shown that the simple beer law for light attenuation through the sample containing dye molecules might be inaccurate , due to the so - called photobleaching effect  @xcite .",
    "this effect is caused by depletion of _ trans _ isomers , which allows light to penetrate to greater depths than those predicted by beer s law .",
    "if dye molecules that absorbed photons do nt return to their _ trans _ state immediately , the new photons falling on the sample can not be absorbed in the initial layers and therefore propagate through the sample following a nonlinear absorption law .",
    "using the model described in sec .",
    "[ sect : model ] , we calculate the stress exerted on the clamps during and after light irradiation .",
    "then we relate the stress to the light absorbance @xmath13 at the back of the sample .",
    "we apply the full nonlinear absorption model which takes into account the forward _ trans _ to _ cis _ and back _ cis _ to _ trans _ photo - isomerization as well as thermal - isomerization of _ cis _ molecules back to the _ trans _ state  @xcite . the major puzzle in photo - actuation",
    "is thereby addressed .",
    "beer penetration depths are typically in the @xmath14 range for normal dye loadings and hence orders of magnitude less than the sample thickness . if a small volume fraction of solid is photo - contracted , one expects the overall mechanical response to be small in the beer limit .",
    "we show that the stress is proportional to the _ cis _ concentration and thus bleaching allows an appreciable sample volume to contribute to the force as a wave of _ trans _ to _ cis _ conversion deeply penetrates . to test the validity of our model",
    "we fit the on - process @xmath3 data of ref .",
    "@xcite at one temperature in order to fix the material constants determining the photo - processes . the @xmath3 response at other temperatures then does not need fitting  the same material constants suffice , after they are shifted by the separately measured changes in thermal relaxation times with temperature change , to reproduce the stress response .",
    "this remarkable universal agreement between theory and experiment confirms the hypothesis of the domination of photo - isomerization over polymer dynamics .",
    "we hence explain the observed stretched exponential ( @xmath6 ) processes in terms of nonlinear spatio - temporal photodynamics , rather than the usual ( unknown ) polymer relaxation processes normally assumed to be behind such complex dynamics .",
    "our analysis reveals that it is important to consider back _ cis _ to _ trans _ photoconversion .",
    "in this section we consider a simple model of stress dynamics of clamped nematic photo - elastomers .",

    "this rough estimate of @xmath12 can be obtained by assuming that the molar extinction for sceazo2-c-10 at its absorption maximum coincides with the corresponding known value for the azobenzene in benzene  @xcite .",
    "let us note , however , that quite good fits can be also obtained for some other values of fit parameters .",
    "this ambiguity can be settled obviously by a further reduction of the number of the fit parameters  for example by measuring @xmath191 .",
    "in our case situation is not so serious , because the parameter @xmath191 is temperature independent , while parameters @xmath132 and @xmath134 depend on temperature @xmath32 only through thermal relaxation time , @xmath210 and @xmath211 .",
    "for example , at other temperatures @xmath32 , one can write @xmath212 and @xmath213 . thus taking the experimental values of thermal relaxation times @xmath198 for temperatures quoted in fig",
    ".  [ fig5 ] we determine the corresponding values of @xmath214 and @xmath215 . then using these values and expression  ( [ stressnorm ] ) for the normalized stress we simply plot corresponding curves for temperatures @xmath216 without any fitting . note excellent agreement of these theoretical predictions with experimental data . extracting @xmath132 and @xmath134 by fitting at one @xmath217",
    "gives universal , fit - free agreement at other temperatures .",
    "we have demonstrated that both significant force magnitude and complex force dynamics result from nonlinear optical absorption .",
    "a bleaching wave of increased _ cis _ concentration , and hence contribution to retractile force , penetrates a sample with a highly characteristic dynamics in which the ( small ) absorption of the _ cis _ moiety is essential .",
    "fitting @xmath3 at one temperature yields the relevant material parameters of the dye responsible for the opto - mechanical response .",
    "the @xmath3 response at other temperatures is then obtained with no further fit by simply scaling these parameters by the separately measured decay rates at the other temperatures .",
    "this astonishing predictive power points to the validity of the nonlinear temporal - spatial optical absorption model used .",
    "future experiments should separately measure beer penetration depths in the weak absorption limit , and the nonlinear material parameters . in that event",
    "there should be no fit parameters at all , as in this current work away from the reference temperature .",
    "with the material parameters thus measured , one could employ the theory to examine more complex systems such as non - clamped elastomers and systems where the response is more complex due to director patterning .",
