    "the sunyaev zeldovich ( sz ) effect @xcite is the redistribution of energy in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) spectrum due to interations between cmb photons and hot electrons along the line of sight between the surface of last scattering and an observer .",
    "the main source for the sz effect is from the hot gas that exists in the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) of massive galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "the sz actually comprises two effects .",
    "the thermal effect consists of a dimming or decrement in the apparent brightness of the cmb towards a galaxy cluster at low frequencies and a corresponding brightening or increment at high frequencies with the null crossover point at approximately 215 ghz .",
    "the kinematic effect has the spectral dependence of a standard temperature shift in the cmb which has the same sign at all frequencies .",
    "the two effects can therefore be distinguished from each other with measurements at multiple frequencies .",
    "measurements of the amplitude of the sz thermal distortion towards a cluster can be combined with measurements of the x - ray emission to determine the angular diameter distance , @xmath6 , whose value depends on cosmology @xcite .",
    "estimates of the hubble constant have been made using this technique for a number of clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) and can be used to constrain cosmological models .",
    "in addition , because the sz surface brightness for a cluster with a given mass is almost independent of redshift , sz surveys can give information about the evolution of the number counts of clusters vs. redshift .",
    "this depends strongly on the evolution of the so - called dark energy or cosmological constant and therefore sz surveys have been identified as one of the key probes of the nature of dark energy ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a number of dedicated sz surveys are already producing results , in particular the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) and the south polar telescope ( spt ) @xcite .",
    "most of the sz detections reported to date have been made at low frequencies corresponding to the sz decrement .",
    "follow - up photometric or spectroscopic measurements of known clusters at higher frequencies would significantly improve the precision in the measurement of the kinematic sz effect as well as constraining possible contamination in the low frequency data .",
    "measurements at high frequencies corresponding to the sz increment suffer from confusion from emission from dusty galaxies , including background high redshift galaxies amplified by the gravitational lensing of the cluster as well as increased atmospheric contamination from ground - based telescopes .",
    "accurate measurement of the sz increment requires a combination of angular resolution sufficient to resolve and remove point sources combined with high sensitivity and control of systematics necessary to detect the more diffuse sz signal .",
    "this paper presents analysis of observations of the galaxy cluster abell 1835 using the bolometric camera ( bolocam ) mounted on the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) , situated on the summit of mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "we also compare the results of this analysis with other sets of data taken at different wavelengths .",
    "abell 1835 is one of the most luminous clusters observed in the rosat catalogue and is well - known as a cooling core cluster .",
    "it is also known to contain two lensed sub - mm point sources , smm j14009 + 0252 and smm j140104 + 0252 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section 2 describes the observations with the bolocam instrument ; section 3 describes the analysis pipeline developed for processing the data ; section 4 describes the modelling of the data and the determination of the characteristic parameters of the model ( as well as the errors in their values ) , and section 5 discusses the results of the analysis of the bolocam data and their combination with other literature results .",
    "the data used in this work represents approximately 12.5 hours of observations taken over the course of five nights at the end of january/ beginning of february 2006 .",
    "the observations were made with bolocam operating at 1.1 mm ( 275 ghz ) .",
    "bolocam consists of an array of 105 operational neutron - transmutation - doped ( ntd ) germanium spiderweb bolometers , capable of observing at 1.1 mm or 2.1 mm @xcite .",
    "the system is cooled to 270 mk to allow the array to operate close to the photon background limit at 1.1 mm .",
    "the bolocam array has a field of view of approximately 8 arcmin , and the beam fwhm is @xmath7 30 _  _ at 1.1 mm ( and @xmath7 60 _  _ at 2.1 mm ) .",
    "the detector is mounted at the cassegrain focus of the leighton telescope - the 10.4 m cso dish .",
    "the principal science targets for the instrument include star forming regions in the galaxy , blank - field surveys for dusty extragalactic point sources ; blank field sz cluster surveys , and pointed observations of galaxy clusters .",
    "observations by bolocam incorporate a number of different scan strategies .",
    "the majority of observations use raster scanning or lissajous scanning where the entire telescope is constantly in motion modulating the array position on the sky .",
    "the data presented in this paper was taken using jiggle mapping .",
    "jiggle mapping uses a combination of chopping the secondary mirror during observations , i.e. switching the secondary from side - to - side , and nodding the telescope , i.e. changing the position of the telescope during a scan .",
    "the beam moves from being on - source ( imaging the region of the target and chopping away from it ) , to off - source ( imaging a nearby region of blank sky and chopping onto the target ) , then returns to being on - source once again ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "jiggle mapping is a means of removing sky background from data , and works by differencing signal from so - called target and reference beams ( centered on the science target and a region of blank sky , respectively ) .",
    "these beams are also referred to as on and off beams .",
    "while jiggle - mapping is an efficient method of subtracting sky - noise , care has to be taken to ensure that the chop throw ( i.e. the maximum angular dispacement of the secondary during the chop ) is large enough that the off beam does not pick up signal from the source itself ( subject to mechanical limitations ) .",
    "for this reason , jiggle - mapping is not always suitable for imaging extended sources , but is good for observing point sources .",
    "the chop frequency for this data set was 2.25 hz , giving a chop period of @xmath7 0.44 s ( compared to a sampling rate of 0.02 s ) .",
    "the chop throw was 90  , while the displacement between on and off beams during the nods was 2.5. the telescope typically remained in the on or off phase for periods of approximately 10 seconds .",
    "the full set of data consisted of fifteen individual sets of observations of approximately 50 minutes each .",
    "the observations were separated by shorter observations of planets and other sources with known position and flux , which could be used for the calibration and pointing .",
    "because jiggle - mapping is a relatively new strategy for bolocam , there was initially no pipeline in place to analyse the raw data .",
    "an independent pipeline was written specifically for this observing mode .    in its original form ,",
    "the time - stream data had been sliced ( i.e. separated into individual data - vectors representing the signal from individual bolometers during specific observations ) , but no other processing had taken place .",
    "the pipeline for jiggle data includes the following elements :    \\1 .",
    "initial cleaning to remove obvious sources of noise using average subtraction ;    \\2 . identifying the nodding sequence ;    \\3 . identifying phase differences between the signal from the chop control and the data ( due , for example , to differences in timing between the telescope clock and those in the telescope control terminals ) ;    \\4 . deconvolving the data for each nod position ( removing the chopping ) ;    \\5 . extracting the signal ( differencing the deconvolved signal from the nod positions ) ;",
    "\\6 . calculating errors for the signals ;    \\7 . determining pointing corrections for each map and hence reconstructing the directional information for each map ;    \\8 . calibrating the maps",
    ";    \\9 . saving the deconvolved datasets ,    \\10 . coadding maps from individual observations .",
    "we deconvolve the chopped data using a fit to the time stream signal monitoring the chopper position corrected for a phase difference between the chopper data and bolometer data .",
    "if the signal being detected by an individual bolometer is modulated by the chopping according to :    @xmath8\\ ] ]    where @xmath9 is the time(@xmath10)-varying flux received by the bolometer , @xmath11 is the flux of the source , @xmath12 is the chop frequency , @xmath13 is the chop phase , one can then multiply this by a fit and integrate according to :    @xmath14\\rmn{d}t\\over\\int\\sin^{2}[\\nu_{\\rmn{f}}t+\\phi_{\\rmn{f}}]\\rmn{d}t}\\ ] ]    where @xmath15 is the fit frequency , @xmath16 is the fit phase .    with an accurate enough fit @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) , therefore , @xmath19 .",
    "the value of @xmath15 is measured from a fit to the chopper data , and the integration needs to be over a complete number of chopping cycles to avoid spurious signal being introduced into the maps .",
    "the individual detector pointing data was reconstructed in three stages .",
    "first a map was made of the deconvolved data .",
    "the directional information was taken from the time - streams of azimuth and elevation stored with the raw data ( converted to ra and dec ) and previously determined offsets ( to convert the values stored at the telescope with the actual azimuth and elevation of the centre of the telescope beam ) were added .",
    "the mean of these values were compared to the recorded position of the source to obtain a mean offset .",
    "the directional information for the map was then reconstructed to include the mean offsets .",
    "the location of the centre of emission for the source in the map was determined using a simple @xmath20 fit of the data immediately around the cluster to a gaussian .",
    "this position was then compared once more with the source values to determine a fine offset .",
    "the directional information was then undated again to include both the mean and fine offsets .",
    "the calibration for bolocam is determined using the resistances of the bolometers as determined by the dc level of the lock - in amplifier output signal , which is expected to be directly related to the flux calibration for a set of observations ( see @xcite ) . if observations can be made of a number of sources of known flux at different levels of sky loading a plot",
    "can be made of the dc level against calibration factor .",
    "we fit a second - order polynomial to the measured calibration points to extend the calibration to the full range of observation conditions . in this way",
    ", we can determine the correct calibration for an observation within an appropriate range of dc level .",
    "these calibration curves are not expected to change significantly over time .",
    "however , given that the previous set of data was taken in may 2004 , using a different scanning technique , we performed a full set of calibration observations roughly every 20 minutes during the science observations .",
    "these calibration sources were chosen to be close to the science observation target and included : 0420m014 ; 0923p392@xmath214cp39.25 ; 1334@xmath22127 , and 3c371 . the resulting calibration curve is given in fig .",
    "the observations of the calibrators agree reasonably well with the may 2004 calibration curve .",
    "the point sources used in the plot were all secondary sources and as a result it was not clear how precise or stable their fluxes would be .",
    "given this , the deviations between the old calibration curve and the sources were not considered to be great enough to warrant revising the calibration values and adopting a new functional form for the calibration , and the may 2004 calibration was used throughout .    4cp39.25 ;",
    "open diamonds : 1334 - 127 , open squares : 3c371.,width=316 ]",
    "once maps had been made of the individual observations , they were coadded to produce a single image of abell 1835 which was then also convolved with a gaussian psf with fwhm @xmath7 30.6 _  _ , corresponding to the best - fitting gaussian to the bolocam beam ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "a model was produced to simulate the observations and derive estimates of the fluxes of the sources .",
    "3 clearly shows the two point sources arranged on either side of the emission from the cluster ( which is assumed to be entirely signal from the sz ) .",
    "these point sources have been detected previously at 850 @xmath23 m using the submillimeter common user bolometer array ( scuba ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) @xcite as well as by @xcite .",
    "the characteristics of these point sources , reported by @xcite are given in table  1 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the results of table  2 shows that the 4-parameter fit with @xmath24 gives the best ( @xmath25 ) value .",
    "the best fit values of the central compton parameter as well as the fluxes of the point sources are , therefore , found to be : @xmath26 ; 7.17@xmath271.84 mjy , and 12.18@xmath271.77 mjy respectively .",
    "the errors on the values of @xmath28 in table  2 include statistical errors as well as errors due to pointing and uncertainty in the model parameters .",
    "they do not include systematic errors ( e.g. due to dust contamination , kinetic sz , etc . ) .",
    "the systematic uncertainties are discussed in greater detail below .",
    "the value of @xmath29 for our best fit model is substantially different from values quoted by other groups , who use x - ray data with much better resolution to calculate their profile parameters .",
    "it is common practice to treat these measurements as more reliable in determining cluster profile parameters ( although see @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , since a comparison of our data to that of other groups was planned , the cluster model for which intensity measurements were being compared had to be the same .",
    "for these reasons , it was decided that , in forming the comparison with data at other frequencies , the results for the more canonical values the profile parameters should be used .",
    "of the two fits with more typical profile parameters , the @xmath30 , @xmath31 fit has the lower @xmath20 value , and is the model used for the spectral fitting .",
    "in order to reliably simulate a series of chopped observations , all sources in the field need to be accounted for . the @xmath30 , @xmath31 fit model is also shown in fig .  3 , convolved with the bolocam beam . the final map in fig",
    ".  3 displays the difference between the model map and the raw data , convolved with the bolocam beam to emphasize any differences between them .",
    "the difference map appears to indicate that the cluster signal and the point sources have been removed effectively and that , therefore , the model is a reasonable simulation of the data .",
    "the signal at the edge of the field is mostly spurious .",
    "it could be suggested that there is a @xmath7 3-@xmath32 detection ( in the raw map ) of a point source just below centre of the image field , but there are no obvious listed sources located at the position of the candidate detection , and it appears that most likely to be a spurious feature of the noise .    using noise maps calculated in the analysis , it was possible to form a histogram of the difference between the s / n data map and the simulated map ( see fig .  4 , where the data is plotted on logarithmic axes to determine whether there was significant deviation between the residuals and the fit toward the limits of the data ) .",
    "the gaussian form of the histogram ( quadratic in fig .",
    "4 ) is consistent with the residual signal being dominated by noise , rather than other point sources .",
    "the histogram was fit with a gaussian , and the best fit has a standard deviation close to 1.0 , indicating that the noise had been correctly estimated .",
    "there may be some suggestion of deviation in the high s",
    "/ n region between the histogram and the fit , but this is attributed to regions of lower coverage in the outer sections of the map , and not believed to represent a real excess of sources .    , width=316 ]",
    "at longer wavelengths the contribution from dust emission is expected to become more important and is a source of confusion .",
    "the literature does not provide an entirely consistent view of whether or not abell 1835 has significant dust emission .",
    "while the cluster s brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) exhibits significant co emission which is believed to trace dust , it would be expected that the dust emission would be extremely bright at 450 @xmath23 m .",
    "there are a limited number of results in the literature that report emission from abell 1835 at 450 @xmath23 m . @xcite and @xcite report strong emission , consistent with a significant dust contribution , whereas the 450 @xmath23 m result given in @xcite of -2 @xmath2713 mjy is consistent with there being no emission from the cluster at this wavelength .",
    "assuming a worst case scenario , however , in which the emission reported by @xcite at 450 and 850 @xmath23 m are assumed to be correct , and all the signal at these wavelengths is attributable to the cd galaxy , a model can be formed of the dust emission using a greybody spectrum , assuming a dust temperature @xmath7 30 k and an emissivity which varies as @xmath33 .",
    "the flux of the cd galaxy at 1.1 mm using this model is expected to be @xmath34 mjy .",

    "along with the dust contribution , it was important to account for other sources of error in the result .",
    "these are discussed individually below :      we estimated the calibration error from the noise - weighted dispersion of the measured point fluxes relative to the may , 2004 model .",
    "this gives a calibration error of @xmath7 10.6@xmath40 , which , when combined with a 5@xmath40 error due to uncertainties in the mars model that all the bolocam fluxes are dependent on gave an overall calibration error of @xmath7 11.7@xmath40 .",
    "the kinematic sz effect ( see below ) is due to the bulk motion of a cluster . in general , the kinematic effect is much less significant than the thermal effect that has been discussed so far . the bulk motion of clusters in a concordance cosmology predicts an rms peculiar velocity of around 300  km / s , but @xcite obtain an estimate of the velocity of abell 1835 of around 500  km / s .",
    "a velocity this high at 273 ghz produces a kinematic effect that is approxiamtely 9@xmath40 of the thermal effect .",

    "these produced an rms equivalent to a 1.5@xmath40 error in the measured cluster signal .",
    "dusty galaxies at 1.1 mm contribute an rms signal of approximately 0.5 mjy ( e.g. @xcite ) , which corresponds to a 5.4@xmath40 error in the measured cluster signal .",
    "other sources of error related to the parameters of the physical model of abell 1835 itself .",

    "@xcite reports errors on the model parameters @xmath42 and @xmath29 of @xmath271.0  n and @xmath7 0.01 , respectively . when these variations are introduced into the model to see what effect they have on the value of @xmath28 obtained by the fit , their effect is found to be small , and represent an uncertainty on the level of 0.6 @xmath40 on the final result .",
    "other potential sources of error include ( e.g. ) clumping in the cluster gas , but the sz effect is relatively insensitive to the detailed physics of cluster gas , these effects were estimated as contributing no more than @xmath7 2@xmath40 to the final result .",
    "a breakdown of the error budget for the observations presented here is given in table  3 .",
    "the value of @xmath28 given by the 4 parameter fit means that the observations detect the cluster with a significance of 10.5@xmath32 .",
    "this is one of the highest significance detections of a cluster in the positive region of the sz spectrum to date . a plot of the sz spectrum of abell 1835 based upon these values is given in fig .",
    "these values have were fitted with a spectrum that included kinetic and thermal effects ( non - relativistic as well as relativistic ) .",
    "the kinetic effect follows the form :    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the optical depth of the cluster gas , given by @xmath45 , @xmath46 ( where @xmath47 is the peculiar velocity of the galaxy cluster ) , and @xmath48 .",
    "the kinetic effect dominates the sz spectrum around the null point ( @xmath49 ghz , x @xmath7 1.9 ) , but makes only a small contribution to the spectrum at frequencies above or below this .",
    "the free parameters of the fit to the sz spectrum were , therefore , @xmath28 ( which characterizes the thermal sz ) , and @xmath47 ( which characterizes the kinetic effect ) .",
    "the values of these parameters that optimized the fit were found to be : @xmath50 , and @xmath51  km / s .",
    "this is consistent with previous measurements of @xmath47 for abell 1835 @xcite and represents the most sensitive test for peculiar velocity in an individual galaxy cluster using the sz effect to date .",
    "the observation and analysis of 1.1 mm bolocam jiggle - map data of abell 1835 , including details of the process of converting the raw data to maps of the cluster , have been discussed .",
    "a parameter search has been used to determine the best fit values of the central compton parameter for the cluster and the fluxes for the point sources smm j140104 + 0252 and smm j14009 + 0252 .",
    "these values are found to be @xmath52 , 6.5@xmath53 mjy and 11.3@xmath54 mjy , respectively with a statistical signal - to - noise of 10.5 , 3.3 and 6.0 respectively .",
    "if the model is refined further to include a point source , representing dust emission from the cd galaxy in abell 1835 , the compton parameter for the cluster is found to be @xmath55 the value for @xmath28 was compared to other literature results and found to agree well . the sz spectrum for abell 1835 , based upon these values for @xmath28 was fit with the full sz form , including both thermal and kinetic effects and relativistic corrections up to 7th order .",
    "the values of @xmath28 and @xmath56 which optimized this fit were found to be @xmath57 and @xmath58  km / s , which are both in agreement with previous literature results .",
    "it is also concluded that , in order to better evaluate the contamination from dust and accurately characterize the spectrum of point sources in the same field as sz clusters more results need to be obtained at shorter wavelengths in order to obtain more a detailed spectral energy distribution .",

    "<S> we present an analysis of an 8 arcminute diameter map of the area around the galaxy cluster abell 1835 from jiggle map observations at a wavelength of 1.1 mm using the bolometric camera ( bolocam ) mounted on the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) . the data is well described by a model including an extended sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) signal from the cluster gas plus emission from two bright background submm galaxies magnified by the gravitational lensing of the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the best - fit values for the central compton value for the cluster and the fluxes of the two main point sources in the field : smm j140104 + 0252 , and smm j14009 + 0252 are found to be @xmath0 , 6.5@xmath1 mjy and 11.3@xmath2 mjy , where the first error represents the statistical measurement error and the second error represents the estimated systematic error in the result . </S>",
    "<S> this measurement assumes the presence of dust emission from the cluster s central cd galaxy of @xmath3  mjy , based on higher frequency observations of abell 1835 . </S>",
    "<S> the cluster image represents one of the highest - significance sz detections of a cluster in the positive region of the thermal sz spectrum to date . </S>",
    "<S> the inferred central intensity is compared to other sz measurements of abell 1835 and this collection of results is used to obtain values for @xmath4 and the cluster peculiar velocity @xmath5  km / s .    </S>",
