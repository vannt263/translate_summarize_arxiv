    "water presents a large variety of solid structures , and up to now sixteen different crystalline ice phases have been found.@xcite a large amount of experimental and theoretical work has been devoted to determine precisely their crystal structures and stability range in the pressure - temperature phase diagram . notwithstanding",
    "the broad knowledge so obtained , some properties of these solid phases still lack a full understanding .",
    "this is mainly owing to the presence of hydrogen bonds between contiguous molecules , which gives rise to some peculiarities in their properties ( the so - called ` water anomalies').@xcite    water molecules appear in all known ice phases ( with the exception of ice x ) as well defined entities building up a network linked by h - bonds .",
    "in such a network each water molecule is bound to four others in a more or less distorted tetrahedral coordination .",
    "the orientation of each molecule with respect to its four nearest neighbors complies with the so - called bernal - fowler ice rules .",
    "these rules state that each h@xmath5o molecule is oriented so that its two hydrogen atoms point toward contiguous oxygen atoms and there is exactly one hydrogen between two adjacent oxygen atoms.@xcite    orientational disorder of the water molecules appears in several ice phases .",
    "though oxygen atoms display full occupancy ( @xmath6 ) of their crystallographic sites , hydrogen atoms may present a disordered distribution , as shown by a fractional occupancy of their lattice positions .",
    "thus , hexagonal ice ih , the stable phase of solid water under normal conditions , presents full hydrogen disorder compatible with the ice rules ( occupancy of h - sites @xmath7 ) .",
    "however , some phases such as ice ii are h - ordered , whilst others as ices iii and v are characterized by partial hydrogen order ( some fractional occupancies @xmath8 ) .    given the variety of ice structures , some unifying classification can help to deeper understanding of their physical and chemical properties.@xcite most classification schemes of crystalline solids are based on the space symmetry and/or the short - distance atomic environments . in other schemes , attention is focused on geometrical aspects of packing of structural units .",
    "such classification methods can be considered as geometrical , as their main criteria are geometrical properties of crystal structures.@xcite a difficult issue of these geometrical classification methods can be the involvement of finding relations between compounds whose structures are distorted .",
    "another possibility is the use of classification schemes based on topological criteria , i.e. , putting emphasis on the organization of the interatomic bonds in a crystal structure as a basic criterion for a crystal - chemical analysis .",
    "thus , topological properties of crystal structures have been taken into account in the past to describe different kinds of materials.@xcite    a discussion of the network topologies of different ice polymorphs and the relation of ring sizes in the various phases with the crystal volume has been presented by salzmann _ et al._@xcite topological studies of three - dimensional hydrogen - bonded frameworks in organic crystals have also helped to classify this kind of structures.@xcite moreover , the topology of hydrogen - bond networks in ice has been considered in order to analyze hydrogen ordering . in particular ,",
    "graph invariants have turned out to be very useful to obtain the energy of hydrogen configurations on a given ice network.@xcite graph theory has been also used to study isotypism in crystal structures.@xcite    to characterize the ice structures from a topological point of view , we will employ the so - called coordination sequences .",
    "this is a generalization of the coordination number , usually known as the number of nearest neighbors of an atom in a solid structure . in this respect",
    ", an ice structure can be viewed as a three - dimensional hydrogen - bonded network , and thus one can consider a simplified structure where each oxygen atom is assumed to be linked to four other oxygen atoms , without explicit mention of the hydrogen atoms lying between them . then , for a particular site , one defines a coordination sequence as a series of numbers @xmath9 ( @xmath0 = 1 , 2 , ... ) , where @xmath10 is the number of sites located at a topological distance @xmath0 from the reference ( see below ) . note that this is a purely topological concept , as the coordination sequence for each oxygen atom in an ice structure depends only on the topology of the network , but not on lattice distortions and other structural factors .",
    "the concept of coordination sequence was applied to silicate frameworks by meier and moeck in 1979.@xcite since then , several authors employed this concept to characterize from a topological point of view different types of materials@xcite and complex networks.@xcite coordination sequences can be used to define a topological density , as a structural characteristic related to the increase in the number @xmath10 of sites accessible through @xmath0 links in a given structure . in this paper , we analyze this question by calculating the coordination sequence for crystalline phases of ice , up to at least @xmath0 = 40 , and thus approaching the asymptotic behavior of @xmath9 at large distances .",
    "a definition of topological density can be derived from such an asymptotic behavior .",
    "this kind of topological studies are relevant to connect the small - scale characteristics of solid water to macroscopic features such as mechanical or plastic properties , not only for crystalline structures but also for various types of amorphous ice , as well as liquid water.@xcite moreover , networks of water molecules are paradigmatic in the study of compounds for which h - bonds play a significant role in their structural , dynamical , and electronic properties .",
    "our model is defined in the following way .",
    "we consider an ice structure as defined by the positions of the oxygen atoms , so that each o atom has four nearest neighbors .",
    "this defines a network , where the nodes are the o sites , and the links are h - bonds between nearest neighbors . the network coordination is four , which gives a total of @xmath11 links , @xmath12 being the number of nodes .",
    "we implicitly assume that on each link there is one h atom , but its consideration is not relevant for our present purposes .    for a given network ,",
    "we define the ` topological distance ' between two sites as the number of bonds in the shortest path connecting one site to the other .",
    "this is obviously a symmetric property , in the sense that the topological distance from site a to site b is the same as that from b to a. we will call @xmath10 the number of sites at a topological distance @xmath0 from a given node , i.e. in its @xmath0th ` coordination shell ' .",
    "this is a generalization of the usual coordination shell formed by nearest neighbors in solid structures ( @xmath0 = 1 ) .",
    "then , we call the sequence @xmath9 the ` coordination sequence ' of this node . in general , different nodes in a network",
    "may have different coordination sequences , and we will call coordination sequence of a network to the sequence @xmath4 , where each @xmath1 is obtained by averaging the @xmath10 values for the oxygen sites in the unit cell . for ice structures including o sites topologically",
    "non - equivalent ( e.g. , ices iii , iv , v , vi , and xii ) , relative differences between @xmath10 values corresponding to sites in a given structure decrease fast with the distance @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , the relative difference is about 0.1% for @xmath0 = 40 , and becomes negligible in the large-@xmath0 limit .    cccc phase & crystal system & space group & ref .",

    ", however , a study of the asymptotic behavior of coordination sequences for a given network requires the generation of large supercells . for the ice structures considered in this work ,",
    "supercells including around @xmath22 oxygen sites were generated from structural data taken from the literature .",
    "the relevant information on these structural data is presented in table  i. then , given an oxygen site , numbers of sites @xmath10 in successive coordination shells were obtained by direct enumeration . to this end ,",
    "one only needs to assign a label ( e.g. , a number ) to each node in the considered supercell , and associate it with those corresponding to its four nearest neighbors .",
    "thus , given a node , one finds successively its first neighbors , then the neighbors of these , and so on , with the precaution of not going ` backwards ' , i.e. , not counting again sites already visited in a previous step .",
    "it is important to realize that the coordination sequence for each site in a given structure depends only on the topology of the network , and not on the actual symmetry , cell parameters , or other structural data . in particular ,",
    "the coordination sequence @xmath4 for a given ice structure is not affected by the ordering of h atoms .",
    "this means that structures such as those of ices ih and xi ( the former being h - disordered and the latter h - ordered ) , with the same topology , will have the same sequence @xmath4 .",
    "there are five other pairs of ice structures sharing the same topology , and connected one with the other through an order / disorder phase transition .",
    "thus , one has six pairs of ice structures : ih - xi , iii - ix , v - xiii , vi - xv , vii - viii , and xii - xiv.@xcite in each pair , the first structure is h - disordered , and the second is h - ordered . in the following , for our topological characterization we will only refer to the disordered case , but meaning that it represents both members of the corresponding pair .",
    "apart from these , there are ice structures with topology different from that of the structures above , and for which no pair has been found : ice ic ( h - disordered ) , ice ii ( h - ordered ) , and ice iv ( h - disordered ) .",
    "there is also the structure of ice x , which is topologically equivalent to those of ices vii and viii , but with the main difference that in ice x hydrogen atoms lie at the middle point between oxygen atoms , and water molecules lose in fact their own entity ( this is however irrelevant for our topological characterization ) .",
    "then , we have 9 topologically different ice structures .",
    "we note that the network associated to ice vii ( as well as ices viii and x ) is made up of two interpenetrating but disjoint subnetworks , each of them equivalent to the ice ic network , and therefore with its same topology .",
    "there is another case , the pair vi - xv , for which the network consists of two independent subnetworks , but they are not equivalent to the network of any other known ice structure . for these reasons we will consider the 8 structures listed in table  i , where we indicate the crystal system , space group , and the reference we used to generate the corresponding supercells .",
    "coordination sequences corresponding to structures in @xmath23-dimensional space increase with topological distance @xmath0 roughly as @xmath24.@xcite then , for three - dimensional structures one expects for large @xmath0 a dependence @xmath25 where @xmath3 is a network - dependent parameter .",
    "thus , @xmath1 increases quadratically with @xmath0 just as the surface of a sphere increases quadratically with its radius .",
    "this is in fact the dependence found for different kinds of real materials.@xcite in general , including also small values of @xmath0 , a quadratic dependence of the form @xmath26 has been found to follow closely the coordination sequences of actual structures.@xcite given a dependence such as eq .",
    "( [ nk ] ) , the parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 become irrelevant for large distances , and one has @xmath29 .",
    "such a parabolic dependence , although it follows closely the sequence @xmath4 for solid structures , is not strictly followed in general .",
    "thus , it is well known for the diamond structure ( ice ic in our case ) that the equation @xmath30 yields values too high by 0.25 if @xmath0 is odd and too low by 0.25 if @xmath0 is even.@xcite    to characterize the coordination sequences of ice structures , and in particular their deviation from strict parabolic behavior , we will consider first and second differences .",
    "we define the first differences of a sequence @xmath4 as @xmath31 and the second differences as @xmath32 note the factor @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( [ dif2 ] ) , introduced for the sake of comparison with the parameter @xmath3 in eq .",
    "( [ nk ] ) .",
    "in fact , for a strict parabolic dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath0 , as in eq .",
    "( [ nk ] ) , one would have a constant second difference @xmath34 for all @xmath0 .    since the parameter @xmath3 is a quantitative measure of the mean number of sites connected to a given site in a finite number of steps on the corresponding network , we define the ` topological density ' @xmath35 as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the number of disconnected subnetworks in the considered network .",
    "usually @xmath38 , but for the ice structures including two interpenetrating networks ( as ices vi and vii ) one has @xmath39 .",
    "for a given network , we call @xmath40 the mean number of sites up to coordination shell @xmath0 , without counting the starting site ( this has been called in the literature@xcite a ` crystal ball ' of radius @xmath0 ) : @xmath41 this quantity has been employed earlier to quantify the topological density of crystal structures.@xcite    to investigate the relation between topological density and real density of ice structures , we will compare values of @xmath35 with those of the volume per molecule @xmath42 . in this respect",
    ", it is important to remember that the different ice structures are stable in some cases at very different conditions of pressure and temperature .",
    "this means that a direct comparison of @xmath42 values for different phases with their corresponding topological densities may be misleading , as @xmath35 is independent of bond lengths , lattice distortions , and other structural characteristics that may dramatically change with pressure and/or temperature .    to avoid this problem",
    ", we will consider for each ice structure a reference volume @xmath43 , defined as the volume per molecule that minimizes the potential energy of the crystal at zero pressure .",
    "for this purpose we need a reliable potential model .",
    "we have used the point charge , flexible q - tip4p / f model , developed to study liquid water,@xcite and that has been used later to study various properties of ice@xcite and water clusters.@xcite this interatomic potential takes into account the significant anharmonicity of the o ",
    "h vibration in a water molecule by considering anharmonic stretches .",
    "the q - tip4p / f interaction model has turned out to give reliable results for several ice phases , and in particular it predicts crystal volumes in fairly good agreement with experimental data.@xcite for each ice structure , determination of the reference volume was carried out by an energy minimization , where both atomic positions and cell parameters were optimized .",

    "given the variety of known crystalline ice structures , it is not strange that the coordination of water molecules further than nearest neighbors may display clear differences between different structures , as could be expected from the pressure / temperature range where they are stable . in this line , as a first characteristic observable in the ice networks , we consider rings of water molecules , which define the particular topology of each structure .",
    "a discussion of the structural variation in tetrahedral networks was presented by zachariasen as early as 1932,@xcite and a systematic description of the topology of different network types was given by bernal,@xcite who suggested that rings should be a basic topological measure , in particular for covalently bonded structures.@xcite    in general , a ring may be defined as any returning path in a network .",
    "this definition is however not very useful , as there is an infinite number of those rings . for practical reasons , it is desirable to identify a small set of rings as fundamental topological units .",
    "following marians and hobbs,@xcite we will define a fundamental ring as any ring that can not be divided into two smaller ones .",
    "thus , in the computer code employed to analyze the ice structures , we first find loops in a given network , and then we check for each one that there is no possible ` shortcut ' between any pair of sites in the loop , as this would mean that the loop could be divided into two smaller ones .",
    "this definition coincides with that employed by salzmann _",
    "et al._@xcite to analyze correlations between ring size and density of ice polymorphs .",
    "note that we call simply rings ( or structural rings ) what has been called ` minimal rings ' by guttman,@xcite ` strong rings ' by goetzke and klein,@xcite or ` primitive rings ' by yuan and cormack@xcite in their studies of different types of materials and topological networks .",
    "other definitions , non - equivalent to that given here , have been presented in the literature .",
    "in particular , for goetzke and klein,@xcite a loop is a ` very strong ring ' if it contains some link which is not a member of some shorter ring .",
    "this set of rings is a subset of those considered here , and is interesting in graph theory for its properties as a covering set , i.e. , the set of very strong rings of a graph is always a cover of all links of cycles of the graph .",
    "this property and ring definitions related to it are of no particular interest for our present purposes , and thus our definition is taken to be consistent with those mentioned above and employed earlier to characterize several types of materials , including ice polymorphs.@xcite    calling @xmath49 the number of rings of size @xmath46 which include a given site of type @xmath44 , the number of @xmath46-membered rings per unit cell is @xmath50 where @xmath45 is the multiplicity of site @xmath44 in the unit cell .",
    "then , the fraction @xmath48 of rings of size @xmath46 is @xmath51 and the mean ring size @xmath47 is given by @xmath52    for each structure and ring size , we present in table  ii the number of rings which include a given network site .",
    "we give separately results for the different crystallographic sites in each structure , as they may have different topological environment .",
    "it is clear that crystallographically equivalent sites are topologically equivalent , and therefore have the same coordination sequence , but sites crystallographically non - equivalent may be topologically equivalent or not . in several ice structures all sites",
    "are topologically equivalent ( homogeneous networks@xcite ) , as we observe for ices ih , ic , and ii , where the number and size of the rings coincide for all sites in each structure .",
    "in other structures , however , there appear several ( up to 4 ) topologically distinct sites ( heterogeneous networks@xcite ) , and different crystallographic sites have different topological environments ( see table  ii ) .",
    "a distinct property of ices ih and ic is that all rings in their crystal structures have the same size ( six - membered rings , @xmath53 ) .",
    "ices vi and xii display rings of two different sizes ( @xmath46 = 4 and 8 for ice vi ; 7 and 8 for ice xii )",
    ". the largest variety of ring sizes corresponds to ice v , for which one finds rings of seven different sizes .",
    "the minimum ring size found in the considered structures is four , which appears for ices v and vi .",
    "the largest loops contain 12 sites , and only appear in ice v. in table  ii we also present the mean ring size @xmath47 for each ice polymorph .",
    "the smallest mean size is six ( for ices ih and ic ) , and the largest amounts to 9.04 ( for ice iv ) .",
    "average ring sizes smaller than six have been found in the water networks of various clathrate hydrates.@xcite    it is known that the structure of water in confined regions appreciably differs from those of the bulk liquid and solid phases , and one may find peculiar topologies for the hydrogen - bond networks in those cases.@xcite in particular , for water - filled carbon nanotubes the h - bond network consists of stacked @xmath46-membered rings , where @xmath46 goes from 4 to 6 depending on the nanotube diameter.@xcite infrared spectroscopy has allowed in this case to detect distinct vibrational frequencies associated to intra- and inter - ring hydrogen bonds,@xcite revealing this technique as a reliable complementary tool to diffraction studies in the topological characterization of confined water.@xcite similar procedures can be also used to study the actual topology of various phases of amorphous ice , where experimental techniques and simulations have been shown to yield complementary information on this matter.@xcite    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tb : coord_seq ]      we now turn to the coordination sequences of the different ice structures . in table  iii we give the mean values @xmath1 of the coordination sequence of the considered structures for several values of the topological distance @xmath0 .",

    "we present also @xmath1 for larger @xmath0 values , such as @xmath0 = 10 , 20 , and 30 .",
    "the accumulated number of sites up to @xmath0 = 30 is given by @xmath54 for each structure .",
    "the coordination sequence of ice ih is the same as that of @xmath55-tridymite silica , as both structures have the same topology .",
    "also , the sequence @xmath56 for ice ic coincides with that of @xmath55-cristobalite and diamond.@xcite    for a network without loops ( bethe lattice@xcite ) , the coordination sequence is given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the number of nearest neighbors ( degree or connectivity in the language of graph theory ) , assumed to be the same for all sites ( @xmath59 here ) .",
    "for actual crystal structures , whose networks include loops , @xmath1 will be in general smaller than @xmath60 .",
    "the number of sites at topological distance @xmath0 , @xmath1 , is affected by the number of structural rings of size @xmath61 .",
    "for example , the presence of a four - membered ring causes a reduction of one node in the second coordination shell ( @xmath62 ) ; five- and six - membered rings affect the coordination sequence for @xmath63 , and so on .",
    "the lower terms of the sequence @xmath4 are especially indicative of the relative abundance of small rings , as such rings appreciably contribute to decrease the @xmath1 values .",
    "none of the known crystalline ice structures contain 3-membered rings .",
    "for structures not including 4-membered rings , one has @xmath64 ( the maximum value allowed by eq .",
    "( [ bethe ] ) ) .",
    "ices v and vi contain 4-membered rings , and their mean @xmath65 values are 10.9 and 8.8 , respectively . in the same way ,",
    "5- and 6-membered rings contribute to decrease @xmath66 from its possible maximum value ( @xmath67 ) for all considered structures , with the exception of ice xii , for which the smallest loops include seven water molecules ( see table  ii ) .    in fig .  1 we show the coordination sequence @xmath4 for three ice structures ( ices iii , vi , and xii ) up to @xmath68",
    "one observes the apparent parabolic dependence for @xmath4 in all cases , but with clearly different slopes .",
    "thus , for ice xii , @xmath69 is more than twice the corresponding value for ice vi , in agreement with the difference obtained for the coefficient @xmath3 of @xmath70 in eq .",
    "( [ nk ] ) ( 4.27 for ice xii vs 2.00 for ice vi ; see table  iii ) . for other ice structures ,",
    "the coordination sequence has @xmath1 values intermediate between those corresponding to ices vi and xii .    as indicated above ,",
    "for a parabolic dependence of @xmath1 as a function of the distance @xmath0 , the ratio @xmath71 should converge for large @xmath0 to the coefficient @xmath3 . for the ice structures considered here ,",
    "this convergence is rather fast , as shown in fig .  2 for several cases .",
    "after some fluctuations for small @xmath0 , for @xmath72 that ratio converges rather smoothly to its high - distance limit .",
    "we observe again the clear differences between different ice structures .",
    "in particular , ices xii and vi have the largest and smallest @xmath3 value , respectively .",
    "note that the parabolic dependence of @xmath1 is in general not strictly parabolic , although an equation such as eq .",
    "( [ nk ] ) can fit very well the actual coordination sequences , with relative errors converging fast to zero as @xmath0 increases .    to analyze with more detail the behavior of @xmath1 vs @xmath0 we consider the first and second differences , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , of the coordination sequences , defined in eqs .",
    "( [ dif1 ] ) and ( [ dif2 ] ) , respectively . for a strict parabolic dependence of the form given in eq .",

    "the characteristics of the sequence @xmath79 depend strongly on the considered ice structure .",
    "thus , in some cases one obtains a periodic sequence as in the case of ice ih , and in other cases one finds a sequence @xmath79 for which no regular pattern is easily found .",

    "there are other ice structures for which we could not find any repeated pattern in the sequence @xmath79 . as an example",
    ", we display in fig .  6 @xmath79 for ice v. we observe in this sequence that the values oscillate around the corresponding parameter @xmath3 ( horizontal dashed line ) , and the amplitude of the oscillations seems to increase as the distance @xmath0 becomes larger . among the ice structures considered here",
    ", we found three cases for which no periodic pattern appeared in the investigated @xmath0-region : ices iii , iv , and v. this is indicated in the last column of table  iii as ` np ' . for the other structures ( where a repeated pattern was found ) , a label ` p ' indicates ` periodic ' , followed by a number referring to the period length .",
    "we note that two of the networks for which no periodic pattern in @xmath79 has been found , are in some sense special , since ices iii and v have been found to display partial hydrogen ordering . at present , we do not know any precise reason for this behavior and , although not probable , we can not exclude an accidental coincidence .",
    "this point should be investigated in the near future .",
    "concerning the sequence @xmath79 , we emphasize that in the cases where no periodicity was found , the existence of a period ( maybe very long ) can not be excluded .",
    "in fact , really long periods have been found in some zeolite structures , using an algebraic description.@xcite however , this is not crucial for our present purposes of comparing the topological density with other structural aspects of ice polymorphs .",
    "the long - distance behavior of the coordination sequence @xmath4 allows us to define the topological density of a given structure , as explained in sect .",
    "the basic parameter for this purpose is the coefficient @xmath3 of the quadratic term in eq .",
    "( [ nk ] ) .",
    "the topological density @xmath35 takes values ranging from 2.5 ( ice ic ) to 5 ( ice vii ) for the considered ice phases . in table",
    "iii we give for each structure the relative topological density @xmath93 with respect to ice ih .",
    "note that hexagonal ice ih and cubic ice ic , although very similar in their local neighborhood have different topological density .",
    "thus , for ice ic @xmath94 , in agreement with the lower @xmath1 values found for ice ic , as compared to those of ice ih .    in connection with our results for the topological density @xmath35 of ice polymorphs , it is worthwhile mentioning that several authors have proposed to quantify the topological density in crystalline solids from the number of sites included in a cluster of a given topological radius,@xcite using expressions such as @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ sk ] ) .",
    "this definition , however , can lack an absolute meaning , as it yields values of the topological density which depend on the cluster size and on the normalization procedure . in this line ,",
    "a more precise definition for the topological density of crystalline solids was given earlier as@xcite @xmath95 ( @xmath23 = 3 here ) .",
    "as indicated above , for large @xmath0 one has an asymptotic dependence for the mean coordination sequence : @xmath96 ( see eq .",
    "( [ mk ] ) ) , and therefore @xmath97 as can be easily derived for the sum of squares of natural numbers . in this way one has @xmath98 .",
    "note that this definition , apart from a factor 3 in the denominator , does not consider the number @xmath37 of disjoint subnetworks in a given structure , as introduced in the present work .",
    "although one could in principle expect the existence of some relation between topological density and molar volume of the different ice structures , it is not evident that there is a close relation between both quantities .",
    "there are various reasons that can contribute to make difficult this comparison .",
    "the most important is the dependence of the molar volume on temperature and pressure in the parameter region where each phase is stable ( or metastable ) , whereas the topological density is a fixed characteristic of each structure , irrespective of the value of external thermodynamic or mechanical variables .",
    "for this reason , we obtain a reference volume for each ice polymorph , representative of the corresponding phase and independent of external variables .",
    "such a reference volume , @xmath43 , can be considered as a fingerprint of the corresponding phase . to obtain @xmath43",
    ", we carry out a minimization procedure ( at zero volume and temperature ) , in which atomic positions and cell parameters are optimized using the q - tip4p / f interaction model , as described in sect .",
    "it can be argued that the use of an effective interatomic potential may introduce a bias in the reference volume of the different ice phases .",
    "this possible error , however , is not relevant for our present purposes , as differences in cell volumes derived from the q - tip4p / f model and experimental data are smaller than 1% , in particular at low temperatures and relatively small external pressures.@xcite a comparison of the volumes predicted by this and other interatomic potentials , including density - functional theory calculations , has been given elsewhere.@xcite an advantage of the q - tip4p / f model is that it allows us to optimize all degrees of freedom in relatively large unit cells with a reasonable computational effort .    in fig .",
    "7 we present the volume per molecule @xmath43 vs the topological density @xmath35 for crystalline ice structures .",
    "one observes that the data points are more or less aligned following a straight line of negative slope .",
    "however , the data corresponding to ices ih , ic , and xi depart from this line . this question will be discussed below .",
    "it is important to recall that ice vii ( along with ice viii ) and ice vi ( along with ice xv ) contain two independent subnetworks .",
    "this means that the total number of sites in each of these structures is twice that of a single subnetwork .",
    "since the parameter @xmath3 in these cases takes into account only sites in one subnetwork , for these structures the topological density @xmath35 equals @xmath76 instead of @xmath3 ( see sect .",
    "data points corresponding to cases with two subnetworks ( @xmath39 ) are displayed as open triangles in fig .",
    "7 . in connection with this",
    ", we remember that ice vii contains two subnetworks , each of them equivalent to the ice ic network , so that the empty space has been filled by the two interpenetrating networks and the volume per molecule correlates well with the topological density , once the above - mentioned factor @xmath39 is included . in other words , for each subnetwork of ice vii , the parameter @xmath3 coincides with that of ice ic , but the topological density is twice larger in the former case than in the latter , so that ice vii appears in fig .  7 following the trend of other ice polymorphs in the @xmath99 plot .",
    "something similar happens for ice vi .    according to the general trend observed in fig .",
    "7 , one would expect for ices ih and ic ( as well as ice xi ) a volume per molecule smaller than that actually found .",
    "this has to be related to the rigidity of the h - bridges in these structures , along with the large empty space between water molecules , which makes that ices ih and ic have fairly open low - density structures , where the packing efficiency is low .",
    "note that both ice structures contain only six - membered rings .",
    "the difference between them consists in the stacking sequence of layers formed by water molecules arranged in six - membered rings@xcite ( ` chair ' or ` boat ' configurations ) . in practice",
    ", structural differentiation between ices ic and ih is complicated by the fact that ice ic usually contains hexagonal stacking faults.@xcite    the stiffness of ice ic and ih structures can be related to the rigidity of the tetrahedral arrangement of water molecules . in this line",
    ", several orientational parameters have been defined to measure the extent to which a molecule and its four nearest neighbors adopt a tetrahedral arrangement.@xcite in particular , the order parameter @xmath100 employed in refs .",
    "gives for the ideal crystal structures of ice ih and ic its maximum value @xmath101 , which means that tetrahedra are undistorted .",
    "for other crystalline ice structures , this parameter is clearly lower than unity .",
    "another crystalline ice structure containing open channels is that of ice ii , which presents one cavity per six water molecules.@xcite the density of this ice polymorph is around 25% higher than that of ice ih , but the former structure contains more roomy cavities than the latter.@xcite we note that the similarity between channels in ices ih and ii is important for the mechanism of transition from one to the other.@xcite however , concerning the rigidity of the tetrahedra in ice ii , the situation is clearly different than ice ih , as in the former case the tetrahedral order parameter takes a value @xmath102 , clearly lower than in the case of ice ih .",
    "this indicates an appreciable distortion of the tetrahedra of water molecules in the case of ice ii .    in connection with the topological characterization of ice polymorphs , an interesting question is its generalization to other phases , such as amorphous ice and confined water .",
    "for amorphous ice , in particular , a topological density @xmath35 , similar to that discussed here for crystalline phases , could be defined .",
    "given the three - dimensional character of the amorphous h - bond networks , one expects to find average coordination sequences @xmath56 with a distance dependence similar to eq .",
    "( [ mk ] ) .",
    "this can allow to study the correlation between topological density and actual molar volume of the amorphous phases .",
    "we have presented an analysis of the ring statistics and coordination sequences in crystalline ice structures . this has allowed us to quantitatively characterize the topology of different ice polymorphs . in particular , an analysis of the coordination sequences up to large distances provides us with a quantitative measure of the topological density of the corresponding networks .",
    "this measure is obtained from the coefficient @xmath3 derived from the parabolic dependence of the coordination sequence on the topological distance .    we have found a correlation between the topological density @xmath35 and crystal volume of the considered ice polymorphs . the general trend shown in fig .",
    "7 is apparently not followed by ices ih and ic , due to the low density and rigidity of these structures .",
    "other ways of characterizing the different ice networks can give further insight into the structural properties of different polymorphs .",
    "in this line , we mention the use of the so - called connective constants , derived from self - avoiding walks in networks , to study complex crystal structures such as those of zeolites.@xcite all this can help to understand thermodynamic properties of solid water phases , as the configurational entropy associated to hydrogen disorder , which is known to depend on the topology of ice networks.@xcite +   +"
