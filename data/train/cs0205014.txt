    "studying semantics of nonmonotonic reasoning systems within an algebraic framework allows us to eliminate inessential details specific to a particular logic , simplify arguments and find common principles underlying different nonmonotonic formalisms .",
    "the roots of this algebraic approach can be traced back to studies of semantics of logic programs @xcite and of applications of lattices and bilattices in knowledge representation @xcite . exploiting the concept of a bilattice and relying on some general properties of operators on lattices and bilattices , fitting proposed an elegant algebraic treatment of all major 2- , 3- and 4-valued semantics of logic programs @xcite , that is , the supported - model semantics @xcite , stable - model semantics @xcite , kripke - kleene semantics @xcite and well - founded semantics @xcite .    in @xcite",
    ", we extended fitting s work to a more abstract setting of the study of fixpoints of lattice operators .",
    "central to our approach is the concept of an approximation of a lattice operator @xmath0 .",
    "an approximation is an operator defined on a certain bilattice ( the product of the lattice by itself , with two appropriately defined lattice orderings ) . using purely algebraic techniques , for an approximation operator for @xmath0 we introduced the notion of the stable operator and the concepts of the kripke - kleene , well - founded and stable fixpoints , and showed how they provide information about fixpoints of the operator @xmath0 . in @xcite we noted that our approach generalizes the results described in @xcite .",
    "we observed that the 4-valued immediate consequence operator @xmath1 is an approximation operator for the 2-valued immediate consequence operator @xmath2 and showed that all the semantics considered by fitting can be derived from @xmath1 by means of the general algebraic constructions that apply to _ arbitrary _ approximation operators .    in @xcite",
    ", we applied our algebraic approach to default and autoepistemic logics .",
    "autoepistemic logic was defined by moore @xcite to formalize the knowledge of a rational agent with full introspection capabilities . in moore",
    "s approach , an autoepistemic theory @xmath3 defines a characteristic operator @xmath4 on the lattice of all possible - world structures .",
    "fixpoints of @xmath4 ( or , to be precise , their theories ) are known as _",
    "expansions_. in @xcite , we proposed for @xmath4 an approximation operator , @xmath5 , defined on a bilattice of belief pairs ( pairs of possible - world structures ) .",
    "complete fixpoints of @xmath5 correspond to expansions of @xmath3 ( fixpoints of @xmath4 ) , the least fixpoint of @xmath5 provides a constructive approximation to all expansions ( by analogy with logic programming , we called it the _ kripke - kleene fixpoint _ )",
    ". using general techniques introduced in @xcite we derived from @xmath5 its _ stable _ counterpart , the operator @xmath6 .",
    "complete fixpoints of @xmath6 yield a new semantics of _ extensions _ for autoepistemic logic . finally , the least fixpoint of the stable operator results in yet another new semantics , the well - founded semantics for autoepistemic logic ( again , called so due to analogies to the well - founded semantics in logic programming ) , which approximates all extensions .",
    "the same picture emerged in the case of default logic @xcite . for a default theory @xmath7 we defined an operator @xmath8 and characterized all major semantics for default logic in terms of fixpoints of @xmath8 .",
    "in particular , the standard semantics of extensions @xcite is determined by complete fixpoints of the stable operator @xmath9 derived from @xmath8 .",
    "our results on autoepistemic and default logics obtained in @xcite allowed us to clarify the issue of their mutual relationship and provided insights into fundamental constructive principles underlying these two modes of nonmonotonic reasoning .",
    "these result prove that the algebraic framework developed in @xcite is an effective tool in studies of semantics of knowledge representation formalisms .",
    "it allowed us to establish a comprehensive semantic treatment for nonmonotonic logics and demonstrated that major nonmonotonic systems are closely related .",
    "however , the approach , as it was developed , is not entirely satisfactory .",
    "it provides no criteria that would allow us to prefer one approximation over another when attempting to define the concept of a stable fixpoint or when approximating fixpoints by means of the kripke - kleene or well - founded fixpoints",
    ". it does not give us any general indications how to obtain approximations and which approximation to pick .",
    "thus , our theory leaves out a key link in the process of defining and approximating fixpoints of operators on lattices .",
    "in particular , when defining semantics of nonmonotonic formalisms , we _",
    "select _ an approximation operator , rather then derive it in a principled way .",
    "the approximations used , the bilattice operators @xmath10 , @xmath5 and @xmath8 , are not algebraically determined by their corresponding lattice operators @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "consequently , some programs or theories with the same basic operators have different kripke - kleene , well - founded or stable fixpoints associated with them .",
    "we address this problem here .",
    "we extend our theory of approximations and introduce the notion of the precision of an approximation .",
    "we show that each lattice operator @xmath0 has a unique _ most precise _ approximation which we call the _ ultimate approximation _ of @xmath0 . since the ultimate approximation is determined by @xmath0 , it is well suited for investigations of fixpoints of @xmath0 . as a result",
    "we obtain concepts of ultimate stable fixpoints , the ultimate kripke - kleene fixpoint and the ultimate well - founded fixpoint that depend on @xmath0 only and not on a ( possibly arbitrarily ) selected approximation to @xmath0 .",
    "we apply our theory to logic programming , default logic and autoepistemic logic ( only the first system is discussed here , due to space limitations ) .",
    "we compare ultimate semantics with the corresponding `` standard '' semantics of logic programs .",
    "in particular , we show that the ultimate kripke - kleene and the ultimate well - founded semantics are more precise then the standard kripke - kleene and well - founded semantics .",
    "this better accuracy comes , however , at a cost .",
    "we show that ultimate semantics are in general computationally more complex . on the other hand , we show that for wide classes of theories , including theories likely to occur in practice , the complexity remains the same .",
    "thus , our new semantics may prove useful in computing stable models and default extensions .",
    "the ultimate semantics have also properties that are attractive from the logic perspective . in particular , two programs or theories determining the same basic 2-valued operator have the same ultimate semantics .",
    "this property , as we noted , is not true in the standard case .    in summary ,",
    "our contributions are as follows .",
    "we extend the algebraic theory of approximations by providing a principled way of deriving an approximation to a lattice operator . in this way",
    ", we obtain concepts of kripke - kleene fixpoint , well - founded fixpoint and stable fixpoints that are determined by the operator @xmath0 and not by the choice of an approximation . in specific contexts of",

    "it follows from the properties listed above that for each fixpoint @xmath362 of @xmath363 and , a fortiori , if @xmath362 is a complete ultimate stable model of @xmath354 , there exists an @xmath264 such that @xmath366 thus , it suffices to show that if @xmath344 then @xmath367 is a complete ultimate stable model of @xmath354 if and only if @xmath345 is a tautology .",
    "it is easy to verify that for every set @xmath368 and for every @xmath369 , @xmath370 satisfies the following properties :    .",
    "0.03 in    @xmath371    @xmath372 is either @xmath373 or @xmath374 , since bodies of rules of @xmath375 are identical .",
    "thus , we find that @xmath376 is either @xmath377 or @xmath362 and , consequently , @xmath378 has a least fixpoint , which is either @xmath377 or @xmath362 . hence @xmath368 is a complete ultimate stable model of @xmath354 if and only if @xmath377 is not a fixpoint of @xmath378 , that is if @xmath379 .",
    "consequently , all we need to prove is that @xmath380 if and only if @xmath345 is a tautology .",
    "let us recall that @xmath380 if and only if for every interpretation @xmath381 $ ] , the formula @xmath382 is true in @xmath335 , that is , if and only if the formula @xmath382 is a tautology .",
    "let us observe that @xmath383 .",

    "similarly , it takes only polynomial time to verify whether an interpretation @xmath264 satisfies @xmath384 .",

    "0.03 in    there is no difference between complete stable fixpoints and complete ultimate stable fixpoints    purely negative programs are in @xmath310    the problem of existence of complete stable fixpoints for purely negative programs is np - complete .",
    "thus , theorem [ com3 ] follows .",
    "we extended our algebraic framework @xcite for studying semantics of nonmonotonic reasoning systems .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is the notion of an ultimate approximation .",
    "we argue that the kripke - kleene , well - founded and stable fixpoints of the ultimate approximation of an operator @xmath0 can be regarded as the kripke - kleene , well - founded and stable fixpoints of the operator @xmath0 itself . in earlier approaches , to study fixpoints of an operator @xmath0 one needed to _ select _ an appropriate approximation operator .",
    "there were , however , no principled , algebraic ways to do so . in the present paper",
    ", we find a _",
    "distinguished _ element in the space of all approximations and propose this particular approximation ( ultimate approximation ) to study fixpoints of @xmath0 .",
    "a striking feature of our approach is the ease with which it can be applied in any context where semantics emerge as fixpoints of operators .",
    "we applied this approach here in the context of logic programming and obtained a family of new semantics for logic programs : the ultimate kripke - kleene , the ultimate well - founded and the ultimate stable - model semantics .",
    "these semantics are well motivated and have attractive properties .",
    "first , they are preserved when we modify the program , as long as the 2-valued provability operator stays the same ( the property that does not hold in general for standard semantics ) .",
    "second , the ultimate kripke - kleene and the well - founded semantics are stronger ( in general ) than their standard counterparts , yet approximate the collection of all fixpoints of @xmath0 and the collection of all stable fixpoints of @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the disadvantage is that their complexity is higher .",
    "but , as we noticed , for large classes of programs there is actually no loss in efficiency of computing ultimate semantics .",
    "this approach can also be applied to default and autoepistemic logics and results in new semantics with appealing epistemological features .",
    "it was also recently used to define a precise semantics for logic programs with aggregates @xcite .",
    "we end this discussion with comments on a possible broader role of the approximation theory .",
    "one common concern when designing semantics of nonmonotonic logics is to avoid models justified by ungrounded or self - supporting ( circular ) arguments .",
    "the well - founded fixpoints ( semantics ) avoid such arguments .",
    "groundedness is also a fundamental feature of induction , a constructive way in which humans specify concepts both in commonsense reasoning settings and in formal considerations . in its simplest",
    "form induction relies only on positive information . in general , however , it may make references to negative information , too . in either form",
    "it is a nonmonotonic specification mechanism .",
    "as argued in @xcite , the well - founded semantics generalizes existing formalizations of induction ( for instance , positive induction and iterated induction .",
