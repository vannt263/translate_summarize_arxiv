    "quantum mechanics is not as any other physical theory .",
    "it applies to the entire physical domain , from micro to macro - physics , independently of the size and the energy scale , from particle physics , to nuclear , atomic , molecular , solid state physics , from the tiniest particle , to cosmology . despite such generality",
    ", quantum mechanics still lacks a physical axiomatization  a quite embarrassing situation when we teach the theory to students .",
    "why so abstract mathematical objects such as `` hilbert spaces '' stay at the core axiomatic level of our most general physical theory ?",
    "we are used to answer : `` this is the _ quantum superposition principle _ , which entails complementarity and wave - particle dualism '' .",
    "that way we save our face .    in",
    "its very essence quantum mechanics addresses , for the first time , the core problem of physics : that of _ measurement_. more generally , i would say , quantum mechanics deals with the description of the _ physical experiment_. the probabilistic framework , which , in such context , is generally dictated by the obvious need of working in the presence of incomplete knowledge , contrarily to our original intentions turns out to be not of _ epistemic _ nature , but is truly _ ontic_. this is the lesson of nonlocal epr correlations .",
    "incredibly , `` god actually plays dice ! '' now , this makes the situation even more embarrassing : on the basis of the quantum superposition principle of probability amplitudes we `` physicists '' preach the ontic nature of probability , and elevate quantum mechanics to a `` theory of knowledge '' !    clearly , in this new view , the quantum superposition principle is not an acceptable starting point anymore : for a theory of knowledge we should seek operational axioms of epistemic nature , and be able to derive the usual mathematical axiomatization from such operational axioms . shortly : for a theory of knowledge we need axioms of knowledge .    in the present work my starting point for this axiomatization is the definition of _ what an experiment is_. indeed , `` the experiment '' is the archetype of the _ cognitive act _ , being the prototype interaction with reality able to get information on it .",
    "as we will see , adopting a general definition of experiment that includes all possible interactions and information exchanges with reality , is a very seminal starting point , which logically entails a series of notions  such as that of state , conditional state , local state , pure state , faithful state , instrument , propensity ( i.e. `` effect '' ) , dynamical and informational equivalence , dynamical and informational compatibility , predictability , discriminability , programmability , locality , a - causality , rank of a state , etc . ]",
    "along with a set of rules ( addition , convex combination , partial orderings , ... ) , which , far from being of quantum origin as often considered , instead constitute the universal _ syntactic manual _ of the cognitive / operational approach .",
    "the missing ingredient is still , of course , the quantum superposition axiom , and for this i will propose at the end some substitute candidates of purely cognitive / operational nature .    in the present attempt some expert readers will recognize similarities with the program of other authors during the seventies , following the ludwig school @xcite , which were seeking operational principles to select the structure of quantum states from all possible convex structures",
    "[ see , for example , the papers of u. krause @xcite , h. neumann @xcite , and e. strmer @xcite collected in the book @xcite ] .",
    "why these work did nt have a followup ?",
    "i think that , besides the fact that the convex structure by itself is not sufficiently rich mathematically for deriving an underlying hilbert space structure , concepts as _ entanglement _ and _ informationally complete measurements _",
    "( i. e. quantum tomography @xcite ) were still not familiar in those days .",
    "recently it has been shown that it is possible to make a complete quantum calibration of a measuring apparatus @xcite or of a quantum operation @xcite by using a single pure bipartite state .",
    "i think that this gives us a new unique opportunity for deriving the hilbert space structure from the convex structure in terms of _ calibrability axioms _ , which relies on the special link between the convex set of transformations and that of states which occurs in quantum mechanics , and which make the transformations of a single system resemble closely states of a bipartite system @xcite",
    "[ ga:1 ] in any experimental inductive - deductive science we make _ experiments _ to get _ information _ on the _ state _ of a _ objectified physical system_. knowledge of such a state will allow us to predict the results of forthcoming experiments on the same object system . since we necessarily work with only partial _ a priori _ knowledge of both system and experimental apparatus , the rules for the experiment must be given in a probabilistic setting .",
    "notice that the information is of the _ state _ of the system , not of the system itself .",
    "in fact , in order to set the experiment we need some prior information on the physical system , e. g. if it is an electric current , a field , or a particle , what is its charge , etc .",
    "the goal of the experiment is to determine something unknown ( or imprecisely known ) about the system : logically this should enter in the notion of state , as will be given in def .",
    "[ istate ] .",
    "the boundary between what is the object and what is its state will depend on the context of the particular experiment , e. g. the charge of a particle can be a property defining the object system  and used to design the measuring apparatus ; if unknown , a property could be the object of the experiment itself , and , as such , it would enter the definition of state .",
    "again we emphasize that our purpose is to give only the syntactic manual of the empirical approach , not the semantics , i. e. the specific physical context .",
    "[ ga:2 ] an experiment on an object system consists in having it interact with an apparatus .",
    "the interaction between object and apparatus produces one of a set of possible transformations of the object , each one occurring with some probability .",
    "information on the `` state '' of the object system at the beginning of the experiment is gained from the knowledge of which transformation occurred , which is the `` outcome '' of the experiment signaled by the apparatus .",
    "it is clear that here `` object '' and `` apparatus '' are both physical systems , and the asymmetry between object and apparatus is just an asymmetry in prior knowledge , namely the apparatus is the system of which the experimenter has more prior information .",
    "clearly the knowledge gained about the state of the object depends also on the knowledge of details of the transformation undergone by the object system , and , generally , also on preexisting knowledge of the system `` state '' itself .",
    "in other words , the experiment can be always regarded as a _ refinement _ of knowledge on the object system .",
    "one should convince himself that the above definition of experiment is very general , and includes all possible situations .",
    "for example , at first sight it may seem that it does nt include the case in which the object is not under the experimenter s control ( astronomical observations ) , in the sense that in such case one can not establish an interaction with the object system .",
    "however , here also there is an interaction between the object of interest ( the astronomical object ) and another object ( the light ) which should be regarded as a part of the apparatus ( telescope@xmath0light ) .",
    "such cases can also be regarded as `` indirect experiments '' , namely the experiment is performed on an auxiliary `` object '' ( the light ) which is supposed to have experienced a previous interaction with the ultimate object of interest , and whose state depends on properties / quantities of it .",
    "also , the customary case in which a `` quantity '' or a `` quality '' is measured without in any way affecting the system corresponds to the case in which all states are left invariant by the transformations corresponding to each outcome .    performing a different experiment on",
    "the same object obviously corresponds to the use of a different experimental apparatus or , at least , to a change of some settings of the apparatus .",
    "abstractly , this corresponds to change the set @xmath1 of possible transformations , @xmath2 , that the system can undergo .",
    "such change could actually mean really changing the `` dynamics '' of the transformations , but it may simply mean changing only their probabilities , or , just their labeling outcomes .",
    "any such change actually corresponds to a change of the experimental setup .",
    "therefore , the set of all possible transformations @xmath1 will be identified with the choice of experimental setting , i.  e. with the _ experiment _ itself  or , equivalently , with the _ action _ of the experimenter : this will be formalized by the following definition    an * action * or * experiment * on the object system is given by the set @xmath3 of possible transformations @xmath2 having overall unit probability , with the apparatus signaling the * outcome * @xmath4 labeling which transformation actually occurred .",
    "thus the action / experiment is just a _ complete _ set of possible transformations that can occur in an experiment . as we can see now , in a general probabilistic framework the _ action _",
    "@xmath5 is the `` cause '' , whereas the _ outcome _",
    "@xmath4 labeling the transformation @xmath2 that actually occurred is the `` effect '' .",
    "the _ action _ has to be regarded as the `` cause '' , since it is the option of the experimenter , and , as such , it should be viewed as deterministic ( at least one transformation @xmath6 will occur with certainty ) , whereas the outcome @xmath4which transformation @xmath2 occurs  is probabilistic .",
    "the special case of a deterministic transformation @xmath7 corresponds to a _",
    "singleton action / experiment _ @xmath8 .    in the following ,",
    "wherever we consider a nondeterministic transformation @xmath7 by itself , we always regard it in the context of an experiment , namely for any nondeterministic transformation there always exists a at least complementary one @xmath9 such that @xmath10 for all states @xmath11 .",
    "according to general axiom [ ga:1 ] by definition the knowledge of the state of a physical system allows us to predict the results of forthcoming possible experiments on the system , or , more generally , on another system in the same physical situation .",
    "then , according to the general axiom [ ga:2 ] a precise knowledge of the state of a system would allow us to evaluate the probabilities of any possible transformation for any possible experiment .",
    "it follows that the only possible definition of state is the following    [ istate ] a state @xmath11 for a physical system is a rule that provides the probability for any possible transformation , namely @xmath12    we assume that the identical transformation @xmath13 occurs with probability one , namely @xmath14 this corresponds to a kind of _ interaction picture _ , in which we do nt consider the free evolution of the system ( the scheme could be easily generalized to include a free evolution ) .",
    "mathematically , a state will be a map @xmath11 from the set of physical transformations to the interval @xmath15 $ ] , with the normalization condition ( [ normcond ] ) .",
    "moreover , for every action @xmath16 one has the normalization of probabilities @xmath17 for all states @xmath11 of the system .",
    "as already noticed , in order to include also non - disturbing experiments , one must conceive situations in which all states are left invariant by each transformation ( see also remark [ r : noinfo ] in the following ) .",
    "the fact that we necessarily work in the presence of partial knowledge about both object and apparatus requires that the specification of the state and of the transformation could be given incompletely / probabilistically , entailing a convex structure on states and an addition rule for coexistent transformations .",
    "the convex structure of states is given more precisely by the rule    [ idim ] the possible states of a physical system comprise a convex set : for any two states @xmath18 and @xmath19 we can consider the state @xmath11 which is the _ mixture _ of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , corresponding to have @xmath18 with probability @xmath20 and @xmath19 with probability @xmath21 .",
    "we will write @xmath22 and the state @xmath11 will correspond to the following probability rule for transformations @xmath7",
    "@xmath23    generalization to more than two states is obtained by induction . in the following the convex set of states",
    "will be denoted by @xmath24 .",
    "we will call _ pure _ the states which are the extremal elements of the convex set , namely which can not be obtained as mixture of any two states , and we will call _ mixed _ the non - extremal ones . as",
    "regards transformations , the addition of coexistent transformations and the convex structure will be considered in rules [ g : addtrans ] and [ r : convextrans ] .",
    "recall that for the convex set of states , as for any convex set , one can define partial orderings as follows .",
    "[ d : part - ord ] for @xmath25 , @xmath26 $ ] , denote by    1 .",
    "@xmath27 if there exists a @xmath28 such that @xmath29 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath30 if @xmath27 and @xmath31 ; 3 .",
    "@xmath32 if there exists @xmath33 such that @xmath27 ; 4 .",
    "@xmath34 if @xmath32 and @xmath35 .",
    "for example , we can `` read '' the definition of @xmath36 in the following way : @xmath32 means that @xmath11 belongs to an ensemble for @xmath37 .",
    "a minimal convex decomposition of a state is a convex expansion of the state in a minimal set of extremal states .",
    "the caratheodory rank @xmath38 of the state @xmath39 ( or simply rank ) is the minimum number of extremal states in terms of which we can write the state as convex combination .",
    "this is also given by @xmath40 + 1 $ ] , where @xmath41 is the `` face '' to which the state @xmath11 belongs .",
    "we call the maximal rank of a state in @xmath24 the _ caratheodory dimension _ of @xmath24 , denoted by @xmath42 .    according to the caratheodory s theorem , for a convex set of real affine dimension @xmath43 ( i. e. embedded in @xmath44 ) one needs at most @xmath45 extremal points to specify any point of the convex set as convex combination",
    ". however , for the convex sets of quantum mechanics one needs much fewer extremal points , precisely only @xmath46 ( the convex sets of states in quantum mechanics have real affine dimension @xmath47 , @xmath48 being the dimension of the hilbert space ) .",
    "therefore , only @xmath46 pure states are necessary to express each state as a convex combination .",
    "such states are also a maximal set of perfectly discriminable states ( see the following ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that the dimension of the faces of the full convex set of quantum states @xmath24 for given finite dimension of the underlying hilbert space decreases discontinuously in quadratic ladders .",
    "for example , the 8 dimensional convex set of states ( corresponding to hilbert space dimension @xmath49 ) has faces that are 3-d bloch spheres .",
    "therefore , the faces of a complete set of quantum states are themselves complete set of quantum states ( for lower dimension of the underlying hilbert space ) .",
    "each face of the complete convex set of states is itself a complete convex set of states at lower hilbert space dimension .",
    "this lead us to consider also the following rule    the faces of a `` complete '' set of states are themselves `` complete '' sets of states .",
    "the above rule needs a definition of what we mean by `` completeness '' , and a possible route could be via the action of all possible invertible dynamical maps , i. e. the isometric indecomposable transformations of the set of states , namely the equivalent of unitary transformations ( see the following ) .",
    "notice , however , that the notion of _ completeness _ is not strictly operational , and for this reason we will not pursue this axiomatic route .    using the partial ordering on the convex set of states",
    "we can easily define the maximally chaotic state as follows    [ def : chaostate ] the maximally chaotic state @xmath50 of @xmath24 is the most mixed state of @xmath24 , in the sense that @xmath51\\,:\\theta\\succ_\\alpha\\chao{\\stset}\\}\\ge   \\max\\{\\beta\\in[0,1]\\,:\\chao{\\stset}\\succ_\\beta\\theta\\}.\\ ] ]    an alternative definition is that of baricenter - state    [ def : chaostate2 ] the maximally chaotic state @xmath50 of the convex set @xmath24 is the baricenter of the set , i.  e. it can be obtained by averaging over all pure states with the uniform measure , namely @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes the set of extremal points of @xmath24 , and @xmath54 is the measure that is invariant under isomorphisms of @xmath24 .    from definition",
    "[ def : chaostate ] it follows that the maximally chaotic state is full - rank , i. e. @xmath55=\\sqrt{\\dim(\\stset)+1}$ ] . on the other hand , from definition [ def : chaostate2 ]",
    "it follows that the group of isomorphisms of @xmath24 leaves the state @xmath50 invariant ( but generally @xmath50 is not the only invariant state ) .",
    "[ isemigroup ] the composition @xmath56 of two transformations @xmath7 and @xmath9 is itself a transformation",
    ". consistency of compostion of transformations requires _ associativity _ , namely @xmath57 there exists the identical transformation @xmath13 which leaves the physical system invariant , and which for every transformation @xmath7 satisfies the composition rule @xmath58 therefore , transformations make a semigroup with identity , i. e. a _ monoid_.    [ iindep ] we say that two physical systems are _ independent _ if on each system we can perform _ local experiments _ that do nt affect the other system for any joint state of the two systems .",
    "this can be expressed synthetically with the commutativity of transformations of the local experiments , namely @xmath59 where the label @xmath60 of the transformations denotes the system undergoing the transformation .    in the following , when we have more than one independent system",
    ", we will denote local transformations as ordered strings of transformations as follows @xmath61 i. e. the transformation in parentheses corresponds to the local transformation @xmath7 on system 1 , @xmath9 on system 2 , etc .",
    "when composing two transformations @xmath7 and @xmath9 , the probability @xmath62 that @xmath9 occurs conditional on the previous occurrence of @xmath7 is given by the bayes rule @xmath63    the bayes rule leads to the concept of _ conditional state _ :    [ istatecond ] the _ conditional state _",
    "@xmath64 gives the probability that a transformation @xmath9 occurs on the physical system in the state @xmath11 after the transformation @xmath7 has occurred , namely @xmath65    at this point it is worth noticing that the present definition of `` state '' , which logically follows from the definition of experiment , leads to a _ notion of evolution as state - conditioning_. in this way , each transformation acts linearly on the state space .",
    "in addition , since states are probability functionals on transformations , by dualism ( equivalence classes of ) transformations are linear functionals over the state space .",
    "this clarifies the common misconception according to which it is impossible to mimic quantum mechanics as a mere classical probabilistic mechanics on a phase space viewed as a probability space since quantum mechanics admits linear evolutions only , whereas classical mechanics also admits nonlinear evolutions .    in the following",
    "we will make extensive use of the functional notation @xmath66 where the centered dot stands for the argument of the map .",
    "therefore , the notion of conditional state describes the most general _",
    "evolution_.    for the following it is convenient to extend the notion of state to that of _ weight _ , namely nonnegative bounded functionals @xmath67 over the set of transformations with @xmath68 for all transformations @xmath7 . to each weight @xmath67 it corresponds the properly normalized state @xmath69 weights make the convex cone @xmath70 which is generated by the convex set of states @xmath24 .",
    "we are now in position to introduce the concept of operation .",
    "[ operation ] to each transformation @xmath7 we can associate a linear map @xmath71 , which sends a state @xmath11 into the unnormalized state @xmath72 , defined by the relation @xmath73    similarly to a state , the linear form @xmath74 for fixed @xmath7 maps from the set of transformations to the interval @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "it is not strictly a state only due to lack of normalization , since @xmath75 .",
    "the operation @xmath76 gives the conditioned state through the state - reduction rule @xmath77    the concept of conditional state naturally leads to the following category of transformations    [ d : purtrans ] a transformation is called _ pure _ if it preserves purity of states , namely if @xmath64 is pure for @xmath11 pure .",
    "in contrast , we will call _ mixing _ a transformation which is not pure .",
    "we will also call _ pure _ an action made only of pure transformations and _ mixing _ an action containing at least one mixing transformation .",
    "from the bayes rule , or , equivalently , from the definition of conditional state , we see that we can have the following complementary situations :    1 .",
    "there are different transformations which produce the same state change , but generally occur with different probabilities ; 2 .",
    "there are different transformations which always occur with the same probability , but generally affect a different state change .",
    "the above observation leads us to the following definitions of dynamical and informational equivalences of transformations .",
    "[ d : dyneq ] two transformations @xmath7 and @xmath9 are dynamically equivalent if @xmath78 for all possible states @xmath11 of the system .",

    "two transformations / experiments are completely equivalent iff they are both dynamically and informationally equivalent .",
    "notice that even though two transformations are completely equivalent , in principle they can still be different experimentally , in the sense that they are achieved with different experimental apparatus .",
    "however , we emphasize that outcomes in different experiments corresponding to equivalent transformations always provide the same information on the state of the object , and , moreover , the corresponding transformations of the state are the same .",
    "the concept of dynamical equivalence of transformations leads one to introduce a convex structure also for transformations . we first need the notion of informational compatibility .",
    "we say that two transformations @xmath7 and @xmath9 are _ coexistent _ or _ informationally compatible _ if one has @xmath80",
    "the fact that two transformations are coexistent means that , in principle , they can occur in the same experiment , namely there exists at least an action containing both of them .",
    "we have named the present kind of compatibility `` informational '' since it is actually defined on the informational equivalence classes of transformations .",
    "notice that the relation of coexistence is symmetric , but is not reflexive , since a transformation can be coexistent with itself only if @xmath81 .",
    "the present notion of coexistence is the analogous of that introduced by ludwig @xcite for the `` effects '' .",
    "this notion is also related to that of `` exclusive '' transformations , since they correspond to exclusive outcomes [ see also ref .",
    "@xcite in regards `` exclusive '' implies `` coexistent '' , but generally not the reverse ] .",

    "we should be aware that extremality of transformations in relation to their convex structure is not equivalent to the concept of purity in definition [ d : purtrans ] , since a pure transformation is not necessarily extremal ( just consider the convex combination of two different transformations that map to the same pure state ) , and vice - versa the fact that a transformation is mixing does nt logically imply that it can be always regarded as a convex combination of extremal transformations .    the convex cone of transformations can be extended ( on the embedding affine space ) to a real banach algebra equipped with the norm given in theorem [ t : transnorm ] , the closure corresponding to an approximation criterion for transformations .",
