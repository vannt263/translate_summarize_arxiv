    "we consider here a database on mixed marriages and newborns to mixed couples , annually recorded by istat ( italian institute of statistics ) for all italian municipalities in the time period from 2001 to 2011 . in that time span",
    "documented foreign born population has grown in italy from just over 1 million to almost 4 millions people , corresponding to an increase from @xmath1 to over @xmath2 of the total resident population .",
    "these figures do not include illegal immigrants whose numbers are difficult to determine . although there are immigrants from almost all nations , the communities with higher presence are from romania ( @xmath3,@xmath4 in @xmath5 , i.e @xmath6 of the total population of immigrants ) , followed by albania ( @xmath7,@xmath4 in @xmath5 , i.e @xmath8 ) , morocco ( @xmath9,@xmath4 in @xmath5 , i.e @xmath10 ) , and china ( @xmath11,@xmath4 in @xmath5 , i.e @xmath12 ) .",
    "the geographical distribution of immigrants is largely not homogeneous : @xmath13 lives in the northern and central part of the country ( the most economically developed areas ) , while @xmath14 lives in the south .",
    "the dataset contains over @xmath15,@xmath16,@xmath4 data , yearly describing - for each of the @xmath17,@xmath16 municipalities - the total population , the number of immigrants , the number of marriages and newborns originating from different types of couples ( either mixed or not ) . for each municipality",
    "we have considered the immigrant density @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the number of immigrants and @xmath20 is the number of the natives . a useful parameter , measuring the number of possible cross - links among natives and immigrants is @xmath21 .",
    "we focussed , in particular , on two quantifiers : the fraction of marriages with spouses of mixed origin ( native and immigrant ) @xmath22 and the fraction of newborns with parents of mixed origin @xmath23 .",
    "the entire marriages dataset contains @xmath24,@xmath25 records but only @xmath26,@xmath27 points were considered in our study .",
    "this is due to the fact that in tiny villages , occasionally , no marriages occurred .",
    "those events account for about @xmath28 of the whole dataset .",
    "moreover , in about @xmath29 of all records no mixed marriages have occurred .",
    "analogously the inputs from municipalities where no newborns occurred account for about @xmath30 of the whole dataset , whereas for about @xmath31 of all records no mixed newborns have occurred .",
    "we separated the dataset into two parts : one for the small cities ( below @xmath32,@xmath4 inhabitants ) and the other for large ones ( above @xmath32,@xmath4 inhabitants ) .",
    "figure [ figraw ] shows the resulting collection of the raw data of each part for the mixed marriages ( upper panels ) and for the newborns of mixed couples ( lower panels ) in the planes @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "we observe that records belonging to villages and small cities , whose population is under @xmath32,@xmath4 inhabitants , count up to @xmath35.figure [ figdens ] displays the data densities and shows statistical robustness ( up to one percentile ) for all @xmath36 up to @xmath37 .    the partition of both marriages and newborns datasets , which has led us to the main results of this work , has been investigated under various perspectives .",
    "we remark that this partition was proposed since an analysis performed over a unified datasets ( small and large cities together ) happened to be unsatisfactory .",
    "it displayed in fact a high dependence on the binning parameter settings revealing the typical presence of _ data mixture _ of interacting and non - interacting type .",
    "this situation led us to partition each dataset , separating small municipalities from large ones .",
    "the implemented threshold ( i.e. @xmath32,@xmath4 inhabitants ) was attempted according to previous work @xcite , where the considered municipalities consisted only of cities over @xmath32,@xmath4 inhabitants .",
    "ex - post an optimisation test on the threshold has been performed showing that the proposed one was a stable choice , i.e. the coefficients of determination ( @xmath38 ) of the data fitting in the two regimes were maximal . moreover , for the chosen partition we verify both robustness and homogeneity among the two datasets ( large and small cities ) in order to exclude pathologies by imbalance .",
    "our tests show that the immigrant proportions over the total population in large and small cities are comparable for each year with a maximum difference between the two of about one percent .",
    "we can therefore infer that immigrants seem to be distributed in the same manner , independently from the size of the municipality they belong to . eventually , the ratio between the total population living in small municipalities and the one living large municipalities is nearly constant ( @xmath39 ) over the years .",
    "we tested , moreover , the behavior of the temporal series ( year by year ) of the proportions of immigrants , of natives and of the total population living in the small cities .",
    "this study shows that the national fraction of immigrants and natives in small municipalities are about the same ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "furthermore , a similar value ( slightly more than @xmath40 ) is found for the total population that lives in cities with less than @xmath32,@xmath4 inhabitants .    since our study",
    "is devoted to investigate the average behavior at the country scale for the two quantifiers @xmath22 and @xmath23 in large cities and small ones , we estimate the average percentage of mixed marriages or mixed newborns , for a given immigrant density . to this purpose",
    "we performed a _",
    "mediant _ average and binning with constant information ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "figure [ figradline ] displays the output averages versus @xmath41 .",
    "the emerging behaviors are well fitted ( see the @xmath38 coefficient ) by two different laws : square root for the quantifiers on small municipalities and linear on large ones",
    ".    the statistical physics approach developed and broadly described in the technical paper @xcite suggests an interpretation for these results .",
    "we know in fact that the linear behaviour emerges , in strong ties conditions , from collective effects when the network is sparse and unpercolated .",
    "the links are rare and the connected groups are made of only few units . on the other side ,",
    "the square root law emerges when the social framework of strong personal ties , is built on a fully connected network where the cases of isolated individuals or small groups inside the communities are rare or completely absent .    in order to better test the predictability power of our theory",
    "we have performed our analysis not only for whole time span of the observation data , but also on increasing time sub - spans .",
    "figure [ figr2 ] shows that the distinction among linear and square root growth is already evident from elaboration coming from only @xmath42 data , and stay stable for increasing intervals @xmath43 etc , up to the whole set of data ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "our results are in good agreement with the classical sociological theories of alienation and anomie about the social behavior on large cities , where social connections are seldom and ineffective , in comparison to villages where they are strong ( see @xcite ) .",
    "our results moreover have the potential to impact policy makers .",
    "in fact , the identification of the growth law of each quantifier in @xmath36 allows to predict the level of the quantifiers for growing values of @xmath36 .",

    "<S> we study the structure of a social network of strong ties ( trust network ) investigating its property of connectedness versus fragmentation . to this purpose </S>",
    "<S> we analyse an extensive set of census data , about marrying or having children with immigrants , collected by italian national statistical institute for all italian municipalities from 2001 to 2011 . not using neither obtaining personal local information but only average ones </S>",
    "<S> , our method fully complies with privacy and confidentiality . </S>",
    "<S> our findings show that large cities display the behaviour of highly fragmented trust networks where individuals face possible phenomena of alienation . </S>",
    "<S> smaller cities and villages instead behave like fully connected social systems with a rich tie structure , where isolation is rare or completely absent . </S>",
    "<S> while confirming classical sociological theories on alienation in large urban areas our approach provides a quantitative method to test them and a predictive tool for policy makers .    human choices , </S>",
    "<S> as clearly elucidated in the work of max weber @xcite , can be distinguished according to the fact that they are _ social actions _ or not . </S>",
    "<S> sometimes , mostly when the matter of the choice is simple and the conclusions can be reached with elementary reasoning , we draw a decision by ourselves , without relying on other opinions and only counting on our pre - existing cultural background . some other times ( the case of social action ) , when the choice is of complex nature or when the information we have is not enough to draw a rational conclusion we proceed , _ whenever possible _ , by relating to others either by imitation or seeking for interaction and consensus . </S>",
    "<S> those two types of individual choice mechanisms lead to two different emerging collective social behaviour each displaying peculiar features . </S>",
    "<S> the case of independent choices usually come with smooth , locally linear , behaviour while the other may present different characteristics , including tipping points , according to the nature and structure of the interactions among the individuals and the topological features of the underlying social network .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we investigate , by analysing an extensive dataset about italy , some features of the _ trust _ social network @xcite involved with two specific choices . </S>",
    "<S> these are the choice of marrying a person from your own country or from a different one , and the choice of having a child under the same two alternatives . </S>",
    "<S> those _ coupling _ choices are among the most important people face in their existence . </S>",
    "<S> this is due not only to their strong intrinsic emotional content but also because norms and regulations , of both moral and legal nature , make them basically life long .    </S>",
    "<S> such choices , with the complexity they come with , fully belong to the category of social actions . </S>",
    "<S> this is both a sociological finding @xcite and also a recent conclusion of the work @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> possible differences observed in their collective social appearance depend therefore on the underlying social network . in particular if the social network is extremely sparse ( figure [ figunp ] ) , with links that are so rare that do not allow the whole group to connect and percolate , we expect a social behaviour similar to a group of independent individuals . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , if the network is globally well connected ( figure [ figperc ] ) , with rare cases of isolated individuals or small groups , we expect a genuine collective effect to emerge .    </S>",
    "<S> distinguishing among these two types of social network has important sociological implications . </S>",
    "<S> the network involved with the two mentioned choices is indeed a crucial one since it is made by strong personal ties @xcite possibly affecting also other relevant personal choices . </S>",
    "<S> being part of a well connected social group , with a shared and mutually approved behaviour , provides individuals with a sense of moral rightness , safety and availability of support . </S>",
    "<S> if instead the network is sparse and the connected groups are made of few units the same perception of belonging to a group is lacking and individuals feel alienated @xcite .    the key idea that we advance in this paper is that it is possible , from the the observation of the global social behaviour , to infer what type of network the choice is holding on . in order to derive the network structure </S>",
    "<S> we investigate how the frequency of each different coupling choice changes when immigrant s percentage increases . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we analyse italian data about the frequency of mixed marriages and newborn children from mixed couples . </S>",
    "<S> our findings show that , up to an immigrant density of 7% , there are two different growth laws according to the size of the municipality . for large cities </S>",
    "<S> ( with more than 10k inhabitants ) if the frequency has grown to a given amount @xmath0 when the immigrant density is 1% it will grow to 2@xmath0 at 2% , 3@xmath0 at 3% and so on . in small cities </S>",
    "<S> the behaviour is different : in order to reach the frequency 2@xmath0 the immigrant density has to grow to 4% , to reach 3@xmath0 it has to grow to 9% and so on . </S>",
    "<S> while the first law is linear , i.e. has a constant growth rate the second , that follows the square root function , has an anomalous high growth rate when the phenomenon starts , which quickly decreases at increasing immigrant densities .    </S>",
    "<S> we interpret these results within the statistical physics framework which is largely used in many research fields to study the behavior of quantities that can be represented as large sums of mutually correlated random variables ( see @xcite and references there in ) . on the basis of a statistical physics model developed in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the two different growth laws depend on the different social network structures . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the large italian cities display the behavior of sparse unpercolated networks while the small ones behaves like fully connected networks . </S>",
    "<S> in other words individuals living in large italian cities turn out to be in alienated conditions while smaller cities provide a full social environment . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion provides a quantitative confirmation of the general sociological theories about alienation and anomie in large cities @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our study does nt use nor produce any information of proximity like who trusts who and is fully compliant with privacy regulations . </S>",
    "<S> starting from collective information we deduce average topological properties of the network . </S>",
    "<S> moreover the fact that our approach is purely of observational nature and does nt present any type of solicitation to individuals nor to the system as a whole , makes our approach ethically viable . </S>"
