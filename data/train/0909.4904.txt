    "steve smale proposed a set of problems for the 21st century .",
    "6th problem concerns the existence of a continuum of central configurations in the @xmath0-body problem . in a nice paper gareth",
    "roberts found that there exists a continuum of central configurations in the @xmath3-body problem , where he allows some of the masses to have a negative value .",
    "felipe alfaro and ernesto prez - chavela improved upon this result by finding a continuum of central configurations in the charged @xmath4-body problem .",
    "however the problem steve smale proposed is still open .    on the other hand , in 1970",
    "donald saari made a beautiful conjecture : _ every solution of the newtonian @xmath0-body problem that has a constant moment of inertia is a relative equilibrium _",
    "@xcite .",
    "saari s conjecture has , in the last year , generated a good deal of interest .",
    "in particular several partial result have been announced ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "chris mccord provided a proof for the three body problem with equal masses @xcite .",
    "jaume llibre and eduardo pia found a different proof and an algorithm that could be used in the full three body problem @xcite .",
    "rick moeckel has devised a computer - assisted proof for the full three body problem @xcite .",
    "florin diacu , ernesto prez - chavela and manuele santoprete devised a proof for the collinear @xmath0-body problem @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the conjecture remains open for @xmath2 .",
    "jerry marsden informally proposed a generalized saari s conjecture at the midwest dynamical system conference held at the university of cincinnati , 4 - 7 october 2002 .",
    "his conjecture concerns mechanical systems with symmetry and gives new insight into the problem .",
    "the original version of this conjecture states : _ for a mechanical system with symmetry on the configuration manifold , the locked inertia tensor @xmath5 is constant along a solution if and only if @xmath6 is a relative equilibrium_. the purpose of jerry marsden was to invite to find classes of dynamical systems with symmetry that verify the properties above rather than claim that all simple dynamical systems with symmetry satisfy the summentioned conditions .",
    "this intent is more explicitly expressed in the  refined saari problem \" that improves and clarifies the statement above and was recently proposed by antonio hernandz - garduo , jeff lawson and jerry marsden ( see @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we wish to study an @xmath0-body problem where the particles interact by means of a harmonic potential",
    ". we will show that a continuum of central configurations can be found in the @xmath7-body problem with a special harmonic potential .",
    "this result is quite interesting and complement the ones found in the literature @xcite .",
    "first of all , the examples in @xcite consider interactions that are both attractive and repulsive , so that , in certain directions , the effect of different bodies cancels out . in this paper",
    "we provide an example where there is no need to introduce repulsive forces and to cancel out the effect of some of the bodies .    moreover , the example that we present requires only @xmath7 bodies .",
    "this the minimum number of bodies for which one can have a continuum of central configurations . indeed for two bodies all the central configurations are equivalent , and therefore there can be only one central configuration .    in this paper",
    "we also provide a counterexample to an interpretation of the generalized saari s conjecture above .",
    "some other examples concerning the @xmath0-body can be found in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the authors find counterexamples in the case of hamiltonian systems with a inverse square law potential ( the jacobi , or  pure manev \" potential ) . in @xcite",
    "the autors present counterexamples for a class of homogeneous potentials with  masses \" of opposite sign .",
    "the counterexample we present in this article is appealing for several reasons .",
    "firstly we do not need to introduce negative  masses \" and thus repulsive terms in the potential .",
    "using negative masses changes the ellipsoids of constant inertia into hyperboloids of constant inertia .",
    "this modifies the problem , since , in the simplest interpretation , the locked inertia tensor @xmath8 should be the moment of inertia i.e. , a positive definite quadratic form .",
    "secondly our example is very simple and does not require a complicated analysis .",
    "moreover it shows that pathological behavior can be found even in the simplest of the @xmath0-body problems : the one with harmonic potential .",
    "furthermore it shows that the jacobi potential is not an isolated case , but potentials with different power law provide a counterexample to the conjecture .",
    "we would like to remark that one of the main benefits of finding counterexamples to the generalized saari s conjecture is to refine our formulation and comprehension of it , and this , in turn , will help us understand the classical saari s conjecture and provide insight in why and how the classical conjecture might fail .",
    "marsden s generalization has the merit of stimulating the development of new tools , such as techniques of geometrical mechanics , to study this problem .",
    "however , by now , it is clear that the generalized saari s conjecture under discussion in this paper , as well as the refined saari problem , do not include all simple mechanical systems with symmetry , but only some classes , as for example , as it is shown in @xcite , system on lie groups .",
    "let @xmath9 represent the positions of the @xmath0 bodies on the plane .",
    "the hamiltonian that describes the problem is of the form h=1 2 _",
    "1^n m_i_i^2 + u(*q * ) and the equations of motions are m_i_i=- a important quantity for this work is the moment of inertia i(*q*)=_i=1^n m_i_i^2 that can be written in terms of the mutual distances @xmath10 as i(*q*)=_i < j m_im_jr_ij^2 where @xmath11 . a _",
    "central configuration _ is a configuration @xmath12 which satisfies the algebraic equation i=^2 u for some @xmath13",
    ". therefore the central configurations are critical points of the potential energy @xmath14 restricted to the ellipsoids @xmath15 . note that when counting central configurations it is standard to fix the size and identify configurations that are rotationally equivalent .",
    "a given solution @xmath16 of the problem of @xmath0 bodies is called _ relative equilibrium _ if there exists an orthogonal 2-matrix @xmath17 such that for every @xmath18 and @xmath19 one has _",
    "i= ( t)*q*_i^0 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 belong to an arbitrary @xmath19 and @xmath22 denotes @xmath20 at some initial instant @xmath23 in such cases the system rotates about the center of mass as a rigid body , the angular velocity is constant and the mutual distances do not changes when @xmath19 varies .",
    "in this paper we consider a potential energy such that u(*q*)=m 2 i(*q * ) [ pot ] i.e. a particular case of coupled harmonic oscillators .",
    "this potential is very peculiar because u(*q*)=m 2i(*q * ) for every @xmath6 .",
    "this means that every point in configuration space is a central configuration .",
    "however in the case of two bodies all the configurations are equivalent , and thus for an example of continuum of central configurations we need at least three bodies .",
    "an explicit example is given in the next section .",
    "let @xmath24 be three bodies of masses @xmath25 , and let @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 be the positions of the bodies where we take @xmath29 ( see figure [ triangle ] ) .",
    "the moment of inertia , which can be written as i=1",
    "3(q_12 ^ 2+q^2_13+q^2_23)=2 3 y_1 ^ 2 + 2x_3 ^ 2 , defines an ellipse in the plane @xmath30 .",
    "therefore the potential function restricted to the ellipsoid @xmath15 has a curve of critical points at ( y_1,x_3)=(,)02 .",
    "we have therefore proved the following    in the three - body problem with harmonic potential given by ( [ pot ] ) , there exists a one - parameter family of degenerate central configurations where the three equal masses are positioned at the vertices of a isosceles triangle .",
    "we wish to remark that for @xmath31 the bodies @xmath32 and @xmath33 occupy the same position .",
    "we begin our description of the counterexample to the generalized saari s conjecture considering four bodies @xmath34 at the vertices of a rhombus ( see figure [ rhombus ] ) .",
    "we let @xmath35 be the four masses and @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath36 , be the positions of the bodies , where @xmath29 and @xmath37 .",
    "we want to consider only those solutions the configuration of which is a rhombus at all times .",
    "the potential energy in this case is u=1 2(r_12 ^ 2+r_13 ^ 2+r_14 ^ 2+r_23 ^ 2+r_24 ^ 2+r_34 ^ 2 ) .",
    "we can also rewrite the potential energy in terms of the coordinates of the bodies u=1 2(2x_2 ^ 2 + 2x_3 ^ 2 + 2y_1 ^ 2 + 2y_4 ^ 2+(y_1-y_4)^2+(x_3-x_2)^2 ) .",
    "the equations of motion for the bodies @xmath38 and @xmath33 are    y_1=&-=-2y_1-(y_1-y_4 ) + x_3=&-=-2x_3-(x_3-x_2 ) .",
    "[ eqbodies ] and the equation of the other two bodies can be trivially deduced from them . since @xmath29 and @xmath37 , and the moment of inertia is such that @xmath39 , it is easy to see that i=2(x_3 ^ 2+y_1 ^ 2)=u/2 . thus , if we let @xmath15 , then the potential energy is also constant , and the curves @xmath15 are circles in the plane @xmath30 . because of the high symmetry of the spatial configuration of the bodies ( i.e. @xmath29 and @xmath37 ) the equation of motion ( [ eqbodies ] ) for @xmath38 and @xmath33 can be written as    y_1=&-=-4y_1 + x_3=&-=-4x_3 .    a particular solution of the above equations , with initial conditions @xmath40 and @xmath41 , is given by the following equations         clearly the moment on inertia along the solution above is 2(|y_1 ^ 2+|x_3 ^ 2)=i that is constant by hypothesis .",
    "the solution of the differential equations ( [ oscillators ] ) can be viewed as parametric equations of the circle .",
    "furthermore the solution ( [ oscillators ] ) is not a relative equilibrium according to the definition given at the beginning of the paper .",
    "more precisely we have the following    the trajectory defined by @xmath42 is a solution of the four - body problem with harmonic potential given by equation ( [ pot ] ) .",
    "this solution has constant moment of inertia @xmath15 and is not a relative equilibrium .    to prove the theorem we only have to show that the solution found above is not a relative equilibrium .",
    "we can focus our attention on the body @xmath38 .",
    "the orbit of the body @xmath38 along the solution described above is @xmath43 and its position at the instant @xmath44 is @xmath45 .",
    "therefore we can write @xmath46 where ( t)= (    cc a(t)&0 + b(t)&(2 t )    )",
    ". however the matrix @xmath47 can not be orthogonal for every @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath47 is orthogonal for any @xmath19 if and only if it satisfies the equation @xmath48 for every @xmath19 , where @xmath49 is the two by two identity matrix .",
    "explicitely we have ( t)(t)^t= (    cc a(t)^2 & a(t)b(t ) + a(t)b(t ) & b(t)^2+^2 ( 2 t )    ) = (    cc 1&0 + 0&1    ) from which we obtain that @xmath50 and @xmath51 . but",
    "this implies that @xmath52 for some values of @xmath19 .",
    "for example it is trivial to verify that @xmath53 .",
    "this shows that @xmath47 is not orthogonal for @xmath54 and thus the solution studied above is not a relative equilibrium .",
    "observe that for @xmath55 the bodies @xmath32 and @xmath33 collide , while for @xmath56 the bodies @xmath38 and @xmath32 collide .",
    "however the equation of motions do not encounter singularities .",
    "two different interpretations can be given to the equations , either one assume that the particles go through each other or that they have an elastic collision .",
    "we allow the particles to go trough each other .",
    "but , simply changing the notation , it is easy to introduce elastic collisions into the problem .",
