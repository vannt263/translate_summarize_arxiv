    "<S> we propose a scenario where only the higgs multiplets have direct couplings to a supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking sector . </S>",
    "<S> the standard model matter multiplets as well as the gauge multiples are sequestered from the susy breaking sector ; therefore , their masses arise via anomaly mediation at the high energy scale with a gravitino mass of @xmath0tev . </S>",
    "<S> due to renormalization group running effects from the higgs soft masses , the masses of the third generation sfermions become @xmath1(10)tev at the low energy scale , while the first and second generation sfermion masses are @xmath1(0.1 - 1)tev , avoiding the tachyonic slepton problem and flavor changing neutral current problem . with the splitting mass spectrum , </S>",
    "<S> the muon @xmath2 anomaly is explained consistently with the observed higgs boson mass of 125gev . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the third generation yukawa couplings are expected to be unified in some regions . </S>"
