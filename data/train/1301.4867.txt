    "in many cases of engineering interest , it is useful to describe strength or mechanical properties of materials , geometrical features of structures or loads and so on , as random variables .",
    "a random variable is fully characterized by the pdf or by its spectral counterpart , namely the cf , or by the moments ( or cumulants ) of every order .",
    "moments and cumulants are related to the coefficients of the cityplacetaylor expansion in zero of the cf and of the log cf , respectively .    yet , the moment representation of the cf is not always feasible . indeed ,",
    "if the derivatives in zero of the cf do not exist , the taylor moments series is meaningless .",
    "for example , the cf of @xmath0stable random variable [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , is not derivable and consequently such representation does not exist .",
    "another example is the response to non  linear structures under parametric stochastic input , which may have divergent moments starting from a certain order , even if the system is stable in probability . with such moment structure",
    ", the cf can not be restored . from these observations , it might be concluded that moment resolution strategies are often infeasible .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate on the particular class of moments with complex exponent and we show how powerful this extended class is . to the author s knowledge , such moments have not been investigated in literature .",
    "then , definitions and existence conditions of such moments will be given in the following .",
    "of course , as the pdf is a real function , it follows straightforwardly that if the moments up to a given integer order @xmath1 exists then all the complex moments with real part less than @xmath1 and greater than zero must exist .",
    "the question is : are such moments useful in reconstructing the cf and the pdf ?    in order to answer to this question fractional calculus will be adopted .",
    "the latter has received a growing interest in the last century and applications in physics and biophysics , in quantum mechanics , in the study of porous systems ( gathered in the book [ 3 ] ) , in fracture mechanics [ 4 ] , in non  local elasticity [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , to cite just few , are available in literature . in stochastic dynamics , the pdf of response to differential equations driven by lvy @xmath0stable white noise processes is ruled by a fractional differential equation , involving fractional derivative in the diffusive term [ 7 ] .",
    "fractional derivatives are encountered also in random vibration with frequency dependent parameter [ 8 ] and in the analysis of linear or non  linear systems driven by fractional brownian motion [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] .    by means of the fractional calculus , we show that the fractional derivatives of the cf in zero coincide with fractional moments , also in the case of cf not derivable in zero ( like the cf of @xmath0stable r.vs ) . to the authors knowledge , the only author giving a relation between fractional moments and fractional derivatives of the cf in zero is wolfe [ 11 ] by using fractional derivatives .",
    "however , the expression obtained by wolfe is given in an integral form quite different from the classical expression relating moments and derivatives in zero of the cf .",
    "indicating with @xmath2 the set of complex numbers , we will show that fractional derivatives and integrals of order @xmath3 of the cf calculated in zero are nothing more than particular moments of order @xmath4 of the random variable .",
    "once this remarkable result is achieved , the usefulness of fractional moments for the probabilistic characterization of random variables is pointed out by using a generalized taylor integral theorem proposed by samko et al .",
    "[ 12 ] , which involves fractional derivatives .",
    "it is shown that , by means of a suitable discretization , the series here proposed involving moments of complex order looks like the classical taylor series . a satisfactory representation of the cf is made possible also for the cases in which the cf exhibits a slope discontinuity in zero as in the case of @xmath0stable random variables",
    "moreover , it is well known that , when the classical taylor series is truncated , the cf exhibits unsatisfactory trends on tails , whilst in this paper it is shown that the fractional taylor series always fulfils the desired fundamental property that the cf vanishes at infinity . by some easy algebra",
    "we will show a very useful dual representation of the pdf by means of complex moments .",
    "finally , we will show by numerical examples that with a finite set of complex moments one can have very good approximations both of the pdf and of the cf .",
    "in particular , the pdf is very good approximated in the tails and this is important in problems like the estimation of structural safety .",
    "in this section , some well - known concepts on the probabilistic characterization of random variables , as well as some definition of fractional differential calculus , are briefly summarized for clarity s sake and with the aim to introduce appropriate symbols .",
    "let @xmath5 be a real random variable whose probabilistic characterization may be given both by the pdf @xmath6 and by its fourier transform , namely the cf @xmath7 , that is    @xmath8=\\int _ { -\\infty } ^{\\infty } \\exp \\left(i\\vartheta x\\right)p_{x } \\left(x\\right)dx\\ ] ]    where @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the imaginary unit and @xmath11 $ ] indicates average . provided that moments @xmath12 $ ] with @xmath13 , defined as @xmath14=\\int _",

    "for example , the moments @xmath17 $ ] of the @xmath0-stable random variables do not exist for @xmath18 and , since the stability index @xmath19 ranges from zero up to 2 , then the taylor expansion ( [ eq3 ] ) can not be applied . in spite of this , since @xmath17 $ ] and @xmath20\\in { \\bf { \\mathbb c}}$ ] with @xmath21 exist , is it possible expanding the cf into some series involving fractional moments of order @xmath21 ?",
    "the answer is affirmative , as we prove after recalling few remarks on fractional calculus . for more exhaustive treatment on fractional calculus ,",
    "readers are referred to the excellent encyclopaedic book of [ 12 ] , and to [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] .",
    "the greatest difficulty one has to overcome dealing with fractional calculus is represented by so many definitions of fractional derivatives present in literature , and each definition has its own peculiarities and technicalities .",
    "as it will be stated clearly in the next sections , every definition is good for our purpose .",
    "in particular , we recall the definitions of the riemann - liouville , marchaud and riesz fractional derivatives and integrals since they are useful for the ensuing results .",
    "the riemann  liouville ( rl ) fractional integrals of order @xmath22 , denoted as @xmath23 are defined as follows @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the euler gamma function that interpolates the factorial function , that is @xmath26 . often , the operators @xmath27 and @xmath28 are referred as left and right hand sided , respectively . in some literature ,",
    "these integrals @xmath23 are also denoted as liouville - weyl ( lw ) fractional integrals .",
    "the rl fractional derivatives , denoted as @xmath29 , are expressed as @xmath30 with @xmath22 and @xmath31 + 1 $ ] , being @xmath32 $ ] the integer part of @xmath33 .",
    "examining rl definitions it is clear that the conditions of existence of such operators depend strongly on the behavior of the function @xmath34 at @xmath35 .",
    "the marchaud definition of the fractional derivative , denoted as @xmath36 is expressed as @xmath37\\right ) } \\left(x\\right)-f^{\\left(\\left[\\rho \\right]\\right ) } \\left(x\\mp \\xi \\right)d\\xi } { \\xi ^{1+\\left\\{\\rho \\right\\ } } } \\ ] ] where @xmath38\\right ) } \\left(x\\right)$ ] denotes the derivative of order equal to the integer part of the real number @xmath33 , and @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "it is worth to note that the marchaud fractional derivative exists also for functions growing at infinity as @xmath40 .",
    "the riesz fractional integration , denoted as @xmath41 is defined as follows @xmath42 with @xmath43 , @xmath44.the riesz integral may be expressed by the rl operator as follows @xmath45 and the riesz fractional derivative denoted as @xmath46 may be represented in terms of marchaud fractional derivative [ 12 ] @xmath47    moreover , the riesz fractional derivative may be also expressed in terms of rl fractional derivatives as follows [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] @xmath48 the operation of fractional integration , which has been introduced for real @xmath49 , can be made meaningful also for complex value of the index , say it @xmath50 , with @xmath51 .",
    "indeed , the fractional integrals @xmath52 and @xmath53 are properly defined under the condition that @xmath49 . in the same way , fractional derivatives @xmath54 , @xmath55 are defined accordingly to relations ( [ eq6 ] ) , ( [ eq7 ] ) , ( [ eq10 ] ) , ( [ eq11 ] ) , having care that @xmath56=\\left[\\rho \\right]$ ] .",
    "it must be clear that integrals or derivatives of complex order @xmath57 ( and @xmath58 ) represent an analytic continuation in the parameter @xmath4 of fractional integrals and derivatives originally defined for @xmath59 .",
    "sufficient conditions on the existence of such operators and extensions to the case of @xmath60 are reported in samko et al.([12 ] , p.38  39 ) . here",
    ", we stress only that the fractional derivatives are derivatives of convolution integral that produces a smoothing on the original function : then , the fractional derivative of a function might exist even if the function is not classically differentiable .",
    "a very important feature of fractional operators is their behaviour with respect to the fourier transform .",
    "the fourier transform of a function @xmath34 defined in the whole real axis , is a function of the variable @xmath61 defined as @xmath62 @xmath63 , jointly with the inverse transform @xmath64 .",
    "then , it has be proven that the fourier transform of riemann  liouville , marchaud , and riesz fractional derivatives of order @xmath4 are given , respectively , by the relations @xmath65",
    "@xmath66 @xmath67 where @xmath68 ( see [ 12 ] , pp 137 ; 218 ) .",
    "analogously , the fourier transforms of riemann  liouville and riesz fractional integrals are given by the relations @xmath69",
    "@xmath70    some of the main properties and rules of the aforementioned fractional derivatives and integrals like mellin transform and composition rules are reported in appendix a.",
    "in this section , useful relationships between fractional moments and riesz fractional integrals and derivatives are derived . in the following of the paper",
    ", it will be indicated by @xmath4 a complex number , @xmath71 , with @xmath33 , @xmath72 reals .",
    "the function used in the following @xmath73 has to be understood ( [ 12 ] , p.137 ) as @xmath74 being @xmath75 the usual _ signum _ function of a real variable .",
    "now , following eq.([eq12 ] ) , the fourier transform of the riesz fractional derivative of the cf is given as @xmath76 applying the inverse fourier transform to both sides of eq.([eq19 ] ) gives @xmath77 finally , by evaluating eq.([eq20 ] ) in @xmath78 we obtain the fundamental relation @xmath79=\\int _ { -\\infty } ^{\\infty } \\left(\\mp ix\\right)^{\\gamma } p_{x } \\left(x\\right)dx = \\left({\\rm { \\mathcal d}}_{\\pm } ^{\\gamma } \\phi _ { x } \\right)\\left(0\\right ) ;         \\gamma \\in { \\bf { \\mathbb c}},re\\gamma > 0\\ ] ] stating that the fractional rl derivative of order @xmath4 of the cf in zero equals the complex moment of order @xmath4 of the random variable @xmath80 .",
    "that is , complex moments are ruled by an expression very similar to that obtained by classical moments ( see eq.([eq4 ] ) .",
    "the easy procedure leading to ( [ eq21 ] ) may also be used for demonstrating the following identities , starting from the fourier properties ( [ eq12])([eq16 ] ) @xmath81 ,    re\\gamma > 0\\ ] ] @xmath82 ,    re\\gamma > 0\\ ] ] @xmath83 ,    re\\gamma > 0\\ ] ] @xmath84   ,    re\\gamma > 0\\ ] ] we want to remark that , wolfe [ 11 ] derived fractional moments , by using the marchaud fractional derivatives in the form @xmath85=\\frac{i^{-q-1 } } { 2\\pi } re\\left\\{\\int _ { -\\infty } ^{\\infty } \\left[\\left({\\bf d}_{+}^{q } \\phi _ { x } \\right)\\left .",

    "notice that the structure of the eq.([eq26 ] ) hides the simplicity of the conceptual connection between moments and characteristic function present in the corresponding eq.([eq22 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , eq.([eq26 ] ) does not give fractional moments explicitly , because of the integral involved .",
    "eqs.([eq21])([eq25 ] ) have been obtained in the most general context by using complex exponents and can be written for real exponent as well .",
    "it should be noted that moments of the type @xmath87 $ ] , after some cumbersome algebra , may be expressed in terms of moments @xmath88 $ ] , in the form @xmath89=2\\cos",

    "summing up , in this first step we have shown that the classical relation between cf and moments ( [ eq4 ] ) is extended also to complex moments , by the rl definition of fractional operators .",
    "the next step is to use a representation of the cf ( and of the pdf ) in terms of its fractional derivatives of complex order calculated in zero .",
    "it will be demonstrated that fractional moments can be used in reconstructing the cf ( or the pdf ) of every distribution ( also distributions with discontinuity in zero in the cf ) extending the well known eq.([eq3 ] ) .",
    "there are many generalizations of the taylor series involving fractional derivatives , see e.g. [ 12 ] , [ 15][21 ] .",
    "riemann himself made the first attempt . in his posthumous published work",
    "he wrote @xmath93 with @xmath94 a fixed real number and @xmath95 is the left  handed rl fractional derivative on a finite support @xmath96 if @xmath94 in eq.([eq31 ] ) is an integer , all the terms @xmath97 disappear and it is equivalent to the classical taylor series .",
    "however , hardy [ 17 ] proved that the expansion ( [ eq31 ] ) is a divergent series .",
    "for @xmath98 large enough the series converges , but , as we are interested on the values of the derivatives of the cf in zero , the generalized taylor expansion of riemann is useless for our scope .",
    "many other generalizations of the taylor expansion using fractional derivatives exist . in appendix b some of them are analyzed in detail showing that they have some undesired property for the representation of the cf .    in this section an integral form of taylor expansion related to the inverse mellin transform , proposed by samko et al.([12 ] , pp.144145 )",
    "will be applied to the cf and to the pdf of a random variable .",
    "then , by means of eq.([eq21])([eq25 ] ) , generalization of eq.([eq3 ] ) will be provided .",
    "the starting point is to recognize that the rl integral ( [ eq5 ] ) may be interpreted as the mellin transforms ( see appendix a ) of the functions @xmath99 , with @xmath100 fixed , that is @xmath101 under this perspective , by performing the inverse mellin transform , one gets @xmath102 that for @xmath103 becomes @xmath104    as claimed in [ 12 ] , this integral may be interpreted as an integral form of the taylor expansion in the sense that knowing @xmath105 on some line @xmath106>0 $ ] , then the value of the function @xmath107 in the whole axis may be predicted . under this consideration , eq.([eq35 ] ) is the generalized taylor expansion proposed by samko et al .",

    "we recall that the characteristic function of a standard gaussian random variable @xmath80 is @xmath114 . in order to apply eq.([eq36 ] ) the value of @xmath115 must be properly selected . as first consideration , from the definition of the rl fractional integral ,",

    "it will be shown that every distribution can be represented by the integral representation ( [ eq36 ] if @xmath120 belongs to the range @xmath119 .",
    "further , the integrand function is holomorph inside the fundamental strip , ensuring that one can choose _ every value _ inside the fundamental strip . outside the fundamental strip",
    "the integrand is not necessarily holomorph and shows isolated singularities in the no  positive part of the real axes . in figure 1 , just the real part of the integrand is plotted choosing a particular value of @xmath121 .",
    "it has to be noted that , in this particular case , the function has poles at 0,2,4,6, ... etc .",
    "now , due to the residue theorem , integrating along the line with real abscissa @xmath113 , corresponds to integrate in the whole half plane at the left of the line , that is to the sum of the residues at the poles of the integrand , obtaining : @xmath122\\vartheta ^{-\\gamma } d\\gamma   = \\\\ \\nonumber \\sum _",

    "the value of @xmath33 inside the fundamental strip can be arbitrarily chosen , then the results here reported for particular values of @xmath33 can be reproduced of course with different choice of its value .",
    "let @xmath80 be a random variable with uniform distribution in @xmath168 $ ] , then all the moments exist and are given as @xmath169=\\frac{a^{2k } } { 2k+1 } ;   e\\left[x^{2k+1 } \\right]=0 , k=1,2, ... \\ ] ]    while the cf is @xmath170 the classical taylor expansion of the cf is then @xmath171 such a series converges uniformly to @xmath7 in the entire domain .",
    "however , when a truncation is performed the cf diverges as it is shown in figure 3a .",
    "the latter circumstance produces an undesirable result when the pdf of @xmath80 has to be restored by fourier transform of the truncated series ( [ eq56 ] ) .",
    "the converse happens by using the fractional series proposed .",
    "in fact , as shown in figure 3b , by applying ( [ eq41])([eq42 ] ) to the cf ( [ eq55 ] ) , one notes that the fractional series remains always convergent in the whole domain and for @xmath172 , @xmath173 .",
    "easy calculations give the moments of complex order @xmath174 for the uniform distribution , i.e. @xmath175=\\left(ia\\right)^{-\\gamma } /(1-\\gamma )",
    "$ ] defined in a strip @xmath176 ; in particular , in figure 3b it has been assumed that @xmath177 and @xmath178 .    in order to show that the proposed series works also for complex cf , in figure 4 , the proposed expansion of the cf is reported for a rayleigh distribution with scale [ da vedere ] . in figure 4a and 4b the real part and the imaginary part are plotted , respectively .",
    "the complex moments of a rayleigh distribution with scale parameter @xmath179 are given by @xmath117=2^{-\\gamma /2 } \\left(\\mp i\\sigma \\right)^{-\\gamma } \\gamma \\left(1-\\gamma /2\\right)$ ] , within the strip @xmath180 .",
    "then , in this case one could choose the fundamental strip in the interval @xmath181 .",
    "despite , the knowledge of fractional moments in some line inside the strip @xmath113 ensures that the series ( [ eq41])([eq42 ] ) is meaningful .",
    "the results of the fractional series reported in figure 4 have been calculated with the choice of @xmath177 , but similar results may be obtained also for other values in the range of validity of @xmath113 , and @xmath178 .",
    "a more interesting and striking example is the symmetric cauchy random variable @xmath80 with @xmath182 .",
    "for such a distribution the moments exist only for @xmath183 , then the usual taylor expansion fails because it would be just a sum of divergent terms , and therefore meaningless .",
    "further , in this case it may be shown that moments @xmath117=1 $ ] , in the strip @xmath183 , and the approach in this paper proposed using eqs .",
    "( [ eq41 ] ) and ( [ eq42 ] ) , is a very good approximation , as shown in figure 5 .",
    "then , we remark that the fractional series representation works also for distributions with moments existing only in a limited range , like the stable distributions , because one needs only the existence of a real moment @xmath184 $ ] in , at least , one real value @xmath33 , such that @xmath113 .    to enforce this concept , as last example , the lvy stable variable with pdf given by + @xmath185 , whose moments @xmath161 $ ] exist if the condition @xmath186 is satisfied .",
    "the cf of this distribution has been approximated with @xmath187 , then moments of the type @xmath188 $ ] , have been used in series ( [ eq43])([eq44 ] ) or , that is the same , moments @xmath189 $ ] in ( [ eq41])([eq42 ] ) .",
    "figure 6a and figure 6b show the convergence of the series proposed .",
    "now , we report some interesting applications of the fractional series eq.([eq51 ] ) to find the pdf from the knowledge of some moments , that is , without using inverse fourier transform . in figure 7",
    "one can see that the pdf of a gaussian random variable is well approximated by 30 complex moments in the whole domain , having used @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "figure 8 and figure 9 show that in order to represent the pdf of a cauchy and a lvy random variables respectively , 10 complex moments are sufficient , with the choice of @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "in this paper , a new perspective of the probabilistic characterization of the random variables has been highlighted .",
    "it has been shown that the fractional derivatives of the characteristic function in zero coincide with the fractional moments . then , integral taylor approximation due to samko et al .",
    "[ 12 ] has been the starting point to develop a representation of both the density and the characteristic function of every random variable .",
    "such a new representation offers many advantages : ( i ) it may be applied to not ",
    "differentiable in zero characteristic functions , and to densities with heavy ",
    "tails ; ( ii ) with a unique set of moments @xmath161 $ ] both the pdf and the cf can be represented in dual form ; ( iii ) the series proposed are not of integer power  type and once truncated they vanish at infinity .",
    "the authors have recently extended to multivariate random variables the representation proposed in this paper . moreover ,",
    "a path integral method for the solution of non  linear one  dimensional stochastic differential equation excited by white noise processes based on complex moments has been studied ( see [ 22 ] and [ 23 ] ) , while the solution of multidimensional stochastic differential equation is underway by the authors .",
    "indeed , the path integral method , which is based on the evolution in time of the response density , has proven to take full advantage from the pdf representation in terms of complex moments presented in this paper .",
    "we gather in this appendix some well  known definitions of the mellin transform needed in the text .",
    "further , we briefly describe the so called composition rules of fractional operators .",
    "the mellin transform ( [ 12 ] , p.25 ; [ 24 ] , p.41 ) of a function @xmath34,@xmath190 , @xmath191 , is defined as @xmath192 along the inverse operator @xmath193 @xmath194 , with @xmath195 .",
    "the mellin transform @xmath196 of the function @xmath34 , such that @xmath197 exists , and is analytic , in the _ fundamental strip _",
    "@xmath198<-q$ ] . in order to perform the inverse mellin",
    "transform @xmath199 must be chosen inside the fundamental strip .",
    "tables of mellin transforms of commonly used functions are given in [ 24 ] and [ 25 ] .",
    "properties of nested application of the fractional operators , called composition rules , are useful in calculations .",
    "suppose the existences of the integrals and derivatives involved in the following relations , and consider @xmath200 and @xmath201 .",
    "then , the properties @xmath202 @xmath203    on the composition of different order integrals , are valid . on the converse ,",
    "composition rule between fractional derivative and fractional integral does not follow straightforwardly . indeed , to better understand the commutation property between fractional integration and differentiation some parallel with the standard differential calculus might help . in ordinary calculus ,",
    "it is well  known that performing firstly the integral of a function and then a derivative produces the original function , i.e. @xmath204 . the same happens to _ n_order derivatives and _ n_folded integrals .",
    "exactly in the same way , applying the fractional operators in the order @xmath205 gives the original function @xmath107 .",
    "instead , performing firstly the derivative of @xmath107 and then integrating , i.e. @xmath206 , one obtains the function plus a constant , or for _ n_order derivatives and _ n_folded integrals one obtains the function @xmath107 plus a polynomial of order @xmath207 .",
    "this simple argument is valid also in case of fractional operators and consequently the relation @xmath208 is not in general true , but depends on the function @xmath34 . it has been shown ( [ 12 ] , p. 4345 ) that the latter is true only for those functions vanishing at the interval boundaries .",
    "although many generalization of the taylor series exist ( see e.g. [ 15 ]  [ 21 ] ) , the only series adapt to express the cf in terms of moments is the series proposed , descending from the mellin transform . in order to avoid useless attempts to readers interested on this topic ,",
    "we describe in this short appendix some reasoning on other possible ways , at least at first sight , to develop a cf representation by means of a generalized taylor expansion .    the first family of generalized taylor series we examine descend from the composition rule of fractional operators aforementioned . in order to simplify the discussion we will use the left ",
    "handed rl fractional integral and derivative on a finite support defined as    @xmath209    @xmath210    it has been already stressed that , in general , the fractional derivatives and integrals do not commute , if the derivative is performed as first operation , that is @xmath211 but , it has been proved in [ 12 ] , that ( [ eqb3 ] ) is replaced by @xmath212 where the operator @xmath213 is the classical derivative of order _ jth_. rearranging this relation one find an analogue of the taylor theorem , expressing the function @xmath34 as sum of fractional derivatives calculated in a point    @xmath214    with @xmath56 + 1 $ ] . from this formula one can state that , if for a function the property @xmath215 holds , then the function",
    "can not be represented by the fractional taylor series ( [ eqb5 ] ) , because all the terms of the sum actually vanish . in the perspective of this paper , in order to understand if relation ( [ eqb5 ] ) is useful , it suffices to study the operation @xmath216 .",
    "recalling that the cf of a random variable @xmath80 is @xmath217 $ ] , or , that is the same , @xmath218$]=@xmath219 $ ] . by means of direct calculations",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath220 and therefore series ( [ eqb5 ] ) is useless to our scope , with @xmath221 .",
    "other values of @xmath222 would not produce a connection between cf and moments .",
    "same reasoning applies to the generalized taylor series proposed by dzherbashyan and nersesyan [ 19 ] .",
    "other taylor expansions have been given by jumarie [ 20 ] @xmath223    or , for @xmath224 , by osler [ 16 ] @xmath225 using relations ( [ eqb6 ] ) , ( [ eqb7 ] ) it was not possible to extend the eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) for two reasons .",
    "firstly , it was not possible to find an explicit relation between the fractional derivatives @xmath226 of the cf and the fractional moments , being @xmath226 defined just for values of @xmath227 , since the fourier transform of such operator , like ( [ eq12 ] ) , does not exist to our knowledge . moreover ,",
    "even if such an expression would exist , terms of the kind @xmath226 , would involve fractional moments whose real part increases with @xmath228 and therefore not applicable to cf not differentiable in zero .",
