    "<S> in addition to the property that these potentials have real spectra , the band structure displays several novel features that are strikingly different from the case of real periodic potentials .    </S>",
    "<S> the work reported here was motivated by recent investigations of non - hermitian @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonian models having real discrete spectra . </S>",
    "<S> one such class of models is defined by the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath14 despite the lack of conventional hermiticity , the spectrum of this hamiltonian is real , positive , and discrete ; each of the energy levels increases as a function of increasing @xmath15 . </S>",

    "<S> the reason for this inadequacy of the wkb approximation is that the differences @xmath67 and @xmath68 are exponentially small when @xmath69 . </S>",
