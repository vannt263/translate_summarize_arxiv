    "since 1998 when a deviation on the luminosity distance of supernovae ia ( sne ia ) was observed by two independent groups @xcite , and later on by other proofs , the expansion of the universe is thought to be accelerating , a phenomena that has been widely accepted by the scientific community since then . in order to explain such behaviour of the universe expansion , plenty of theoretical models",
    "have been proposed to sort out this challenge , under the name of dark energy .",
    "the list of theoretical models includes canonical / phantom scalar fields , vector fields , modifications of general relativity ( gr ) , or a cosmological constant , among others@xcite .",
    "the latter , known as @xmath0cdm model , has been the one that serves as a reference to test the others .",
    "+ however , plenty of models of dark energy are able to fit the data as good as @xmath0cdm model , what increases the difficulty to sort out this problem .",
    "this degeneracy among models does not seem to break at the background level at least with the present data , but other tests are required , as the analysis of the perturbations .",
    "then , a useful tool can be to develop an approach able to provide a particular dynamical behaviour of dark energy without providing explicitly the underlying theoretical framework .",
    "roughly speaking , an independent - model approach that serves just for phenomenological purposes . in this sense",
    ", some interesting approaches have been analysed over the last years . in this sense , some parametrizations of the dark energy equation of state ( eos ) may provide information about the dynamical evolution of dark energy , while other model - independent methods as cosmography may lead to information about the background evolution and the possibility of testing @xmath0cdm model . here some issues regarding these model - independent methods are analysed and their usefulness for testing the concordance model of cosmology .",
    "in order to test the dynamics of dark energy , some parametrizations of the eos for dark energy have been proposed in the literature , in such a way that may show up how the evolution of dark energy is , at least at low redshifts , regardless of the underlying theory . in this sense",
    ", we may highlight the ones proposed by huterer and turner in 2001@xcite , and the chevallier - polarski - linder parametrization@xcite , which are given by w_ht(z ) = w_0 + w_1 z , w_cpl = w_0+w_1",
    ". [ st11 ] the first parametrization , also called linear redshift parametrization , is assumed to describe the behaviour of the dark energy fluid at low redshift ( @xmath1 ) , while the second one tends to a constant for large redshifts .",
    "fitting both parametrizations with supernovae ia data , the best fit gives @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( ht parametrization ) , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( cpl parametrization ) , leading to a very similar goodness of fit in both cases .",
    "note that both parametrizations include @xmath0cdm as a particular case which does not coincide with the best fit although can not be discarded .",
    "in addition , both phenomenological descriptions predict a very different eos at @xmath6 , where @xmath7 ( phantom - like fluid ) and @xmath8 , a degeneracy problem that commonly arise when comparing theoretical models directly .",
    "+ similarly , other authors have investigated other parametrizations of the eos where a fast transition -to a phantom epoch- may occur@xcite : @xmath9\\ , \\quad w_2(z)=-1 + w_0 \\tanh\\left(z - z_0\\right)\\ .",
    "\\label{2.1}\\ ] ] here @xmath10 and @xmath11 are free parameters , being @xmath11 the turning point of both functions along the cosmological evolution and @xmath12 the value of the eos parameter when @xmath13 . note also that for @xmath14 , @xmath0cdm is recovered in both cases , while the phantom transition may never occur for some particular ranges of the free parameters .",
    "consequently , in the first parametrisation in ( [ 2.1 ] ) , a future singularity will occur in case that @xmath15 whereas the expansion would be smooth when @xmath16 . in the second one ,",
    "the value of @xmath17 is above -1 for negative ( positive ) values of @xmath12 and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , so there is no singularity . for positive ( negative ) values of @xmath12 and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , the value of @xmath17 is below @xmath20 and a singularity occurs .",
    "thus , depending on the free parameters , the above models may lead to some kind of future singularity . then , by using sne ia data , the best fits are obtained for both models in ( [ 2.1 ] ) and compared with @xmath0cdm .",
    "the results are summarised in the following table , where the best @xmath21 is included as well as the reduced @xmath22 in order to compare the goodness of the fit for every model .",
    "as shown , every model gives a very similar fit , but different cosmological evolutions .",
    "similarly , by using other data sets as bao , the degeneracy of the results remains , such that parameterisations of the eos for dark energy are not very useful to find out how the dynamics of dark energy are , at least with the available data sets .",
    ".best fit for the models ( [ 2.1 ] ) with @xmath23 by using the sne ia dataset @xcite .",
    "the result for the @xmath0cdm model is also shown .",
    "[ table1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      since flat @xmath0cdm model gives unequivocally @xmath24 regardless of the matter -and dark energy- content , cosmography can be used as a test for the @xmath0cdm model . in order to show the usefulness of the approach ,",
    "we have generated sne ia data by assuming a xcdm model , different from @xmath0cdm , given by : @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 , which gives @xmath28 .",
    "then , by assuming the variable @xmath29 and fitting the two parameters sets @xmath30 ( fourth order ) and @xmath31 ( fifth order ) , we have tested whether the cosmographic approach can rule out @xmath0cdm by obtaining the posterior probability for @xmath32 . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , there is some evidence of @xmath33 when considering @xmath30 but such evidence disappears when @xmath31 is assumed .",
    "in addition , we have also included the posterior probability for @xmath32 while considering directly the expression of the hubble parameter for the xcdm model , which leads to a much better fit .",
    "consequently , the constraints obtained by using cosmography present clear limits while comparing the concordance model with close - enough competitors .",
    "cosmography have been also used for reconstructing some particular models for dark energy , since the underlying action can be expanded around @xmath6 and a correspondence with the cosmographic parameters is obtained .",
    "for instance , by considering the usual quintessence / phantom scalar field model for dark energy , @xmath34\\ , $ ] where @xmath35 is the factor that renormalises the scalar field @xmath36 and @xmath37 its potential . then , the derivatives of the potential evaluated today , i.e. , at redshift zero , can be expressed in terms of the cosmographic parameters as follows [ de3 ] & & = 2-q_0-  , = 4 + 3q_0-j_0-  , & & = 4 + 8q_0+j_0(4+q_0)+s_0 - 9_m  , where we have used the flrw equations for this model .",
    "we can assume @xmath38 by considering the universe to be close enough to @xmath0cdm today , what yields a one - to - one correspondence between the derivatives of the potential and the cosmographic parameters .",
    "then , fitting the cosmographic parameters leads to constraints over the derivatives of the scalar potential .",
    "however , as shown by dunsby et al ( 2015)@xcite , the constraints obtained by means of the cosmographic approach provides larger errors than other model - independent methods .",
    "+ similarly , higher - order derivatives models as galileons or @xmath39 gravities can be evaluated at @xmath6 in terms of the cosmographic parameters . however , in this case the higher number of degrees of freedom does not allow to get a one - to - one correspondence as in ( [ de3 ] ) . in order to show this , let us consider @xmath39 gravity , whose derivatives evaluated today lead to @xmath40\\,.\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this case , there are two extra free parameters , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "this means we need either theoretical priors or additional tests since data does not provide any constraints over @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "some previous works assumed the values of @xmath45 and @xmath46 a priori , such that the model coincides with general relativity at @xmath6 , but this may lead to instabilities .",
    "let us illustrate the difficulties in getting good constraints for @xmath39 gravities by generating mock data and assuming some sensible priors over the aforementioned parameters for the following toy - model : @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the probability for @xmath50 are depicted . here",
    "three different hypotheses have been assumed : the true values of @xmath51 , @xmath52 and a `` broad '' marginalisation ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) .",
    "the probability of @xmath55 is highly dependent on the choice of @xmath51 which may even lead to ruling out the true values of @xmath55 , whether are not known in advance - as is the case when dealing with real data .",
    "there are not large differences for the values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 , but the errors are so large than almost any @xmath39 may be valid , leading to a completely degenerated result .",
    "consequently cosmography is extremely weak when reconstructing @xmath39 gravities , since it does not allow to distinguish among different lagrangians .",
