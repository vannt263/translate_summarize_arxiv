    "a boundary between quantum and classical worlds is rather difficult to draw precisely , while the problem of their distinguishing is getting more important than it was hardly ever before .",
    "this problem is particularly important for the large - scale quantum computer to be constructed because it must be a macroscopic object and exhibit quantum properties at the same time .",
    "the investigations in this field of science are also stimulated by the attempts to describe quantum mechanical phenomena by different kinds of hidden variables models . though these problems have been paid a great attention for many years the common point of view has not been achieved .",
    "the discussions came up with a bang after a recent proposal @xcite of a simple test of checking whether it is possible or not to describe a given set of experimental data by a classical probabilistic model .    in quantum mechanics",
    "the state of a system can be identified with a fair probability called tomographic probability distribution or state tomogram ( see , e.g. , the review @xcite ) .",
    "the probability representation of quantum states with continuous variables ( position , momentum ) was introduced in @xcite and that of states with discrete variables ( spin , qudits ) was introduced in @xcite . in the probability representation of quantum mechanics the relation between classical and quantum systems behavior can be studied using the same notion of states expressed in terms of the probability distribution ( tomogram ) in both classical and quantum domains @xcite .",
    "the quantum ( or classical ) nature of a system state can be clarified if in the system the uncertainty relations @xcite for conjugate variables are fulfilled .",
    "also , if the state is quantum , it can be similar to a classical one and there are some studies of the classicality ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) based on properties of the diagonal representation of density operator @xcite ( or _",
    "p_-function @xcite ) .    in the works @xcite , quantum or classical properties of a system state were associated with measuring some specific observables such that there exist certain inequalities which hold true in classical domain and are violated in quantum domain .",
    "violation of the inequalities is considered as a quantumness witness of the system state . in this sense ,",
    "the criterion @xcite is similar in its spirit to the bell inequalities @xcite .",
    "the bell inequalities were studied by means of the tomographic  probability representation in @xcite .",
    "the aim of our work is to consider the inequalities introduced in @xcite and their properties in classical and quantum domains within the framework of the probability representation of quantum states .",
    "we suppose that such a procedure is necessary while dealing with the quantum probabilistic model based on tomograms .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .    in sec .",
    "[ spin - tomogram ] , we are aimed at recalling the tomographic representation of qubit states and observables by employing both ordinary and dual tomographic symbols . in sec .",

    "[ example ] , we present a family of observables which can be used to detect quantumness of an arbitrary generally mixed state @xmath0 of a single system . here",
    "we also predict what kind of experiment one should make to test the quantumness of a state specified by its tomogram . in sec .",

    "the general procedure to use dequantizer operators was discussed in the context of star - product quantization schiemes in @xcite .",
    "the explicit form of the dequantizer @xmath11 can be obtained readily by exploiting the matrix @xmath6 expressed in terms of the euler angles @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 :    @xmath15    therefore , taking advantage of @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the @xmath18 identity matrix and @xmath19 is the third pauli matrix , one can write    @xmath20    where @xmath21 and the matrix @xmath22 has the following form    @xmath23    if given the spin tomogram @xmath24 it is possible to reconstruct the density operator @xmath1 @xcite .",

    "it is worth noting that both quantizer and dequantizer are operators depending on the set of parameters @xmath9 so it seems possible to swap quantizer with the dequantizer .",
