    "the investigation of the properties of real materials from first principles is one of the challenging problems in condensed matter physics . over the last half of century",
    "the methods within density functional theory framework recommended themselves as very successful at describing the wide band compounds .",
    "concurrently the coherent potential approximation  @xcite ( cpa ) was developed to treat the effects of disorder in alloys and real materials that are far from perfect crystal stoichiometry .",
    "the physics of transition metal alloys and steels are defined by the doping components and hence it is highly desirable to have a method that can treat on equal footing disorder and partially filled strongly interacting @xmath0 states of transition metals .",
    "the widely accepted solution for problem of interacting electrons is dynamical mean field theory  @xcite ( dmft ) that has a common feature with cpa  the effective medium interpretation of the system of interest .    on the model level",
    "the cpa+dmft method was introduced by jani  @xcite almost two decades ago where they combined coherent potential approximation with dynamical mean field theory to treat problem of disorder and interacting electrons simultaneously . later on they studied in details the thermodynamic properties for the anderson - hubbard model with different type of disorder distributions for half - filling and constructed magnetic phase diagram  @xcite . in the same years",
    ", bhatt and fisher  @xcite and dobrosavljevi and kotliar  @xcite , who also studied half - filled system , found non fermi liquid behavior of interacting systems with different type of disorder at low temperatures that manifested by divergent magnetic susceptibility and linear coefficient at specific heat , @xmath1 , induced by local moments .",
    "laad  @xcite studied the spectral properties and observed that at small values of disorder strength the renormalized fermi liquid behavior is retaining while increase of disorder results in the incoherent metallic and than insulating state .",
    "byczuk and co - authors in a number of papers  @xcite studied different properties of the anderson - hubbard model .",
    "they found that disorder can enhance the curie temperature with respect to a perfect system  @xcite and for large values of disorder strength the metal - insulator transition can occur at non - integer filling equal to concentration  @xcite . in case of full diagonal disorder lombardo",
    "@xcite found that transition from a band insulator to a metallic state and further to a mott - hubbard insulator can be driven by the correlation strength of only one of the alloy constituents .",
    "the specific heat is one of the easy - to - measure and , at the same time , important quantity that gives an access to the many thermodynamic properties of real materials .",
    "therefore , the understanding of its behavior upon doping , temperature , pressure or other external parameters is of high importance for physics of alloys . in the present paper",
    "we investigate the specific heat in the disordered hubbard model with the local binary disorder as a function of temperature and doping .",
    "this will allow one for better explanation of the steel s and alloy s properties .",
    "the hubbard - type hamiltonian of the binary alloy system @xmath2 with substitutional type of disorder can be written as @xmath3 where @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) is a creation ( annihilation ) operator and @xmath6 ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 are the site and spin indexes ) . therefore , the first term is responsible for the transfer of the electrons from one site to other with the hopping amplitude @xmath10 .",
    "the second term contains @xmath11 and @xmath12 that are one site and chemical potentials .",
    "the former is equal to either @xmath13 or @xmath14 ( case of so - called diagonal disorder ) with the probability @xmath15 or @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the last term of this hamiltonian is an interacting contribution , like in conventional hubbard model , but different for the different atomic species , @xmath18 or @xmath19 , depending on atom remaining on site @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) is a concentration of the atoms of type @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the complexity of the above hubbard - type hamiltonian is high enough to be solved directly but one can follow the effective medium ideology applied in coherent potential approximation for disordered systems and later in dynamical mean - field theory to treat correlated problem . in this case",
    "an action for the effective medium problem is @xmath22 with green function of effective medium @xmath23 where @xmath24 is an inverse temperature , @xmath25 are fermionic matsubara frequencies and @xmath26 is a fourier transform of the kinetic term of the hamiltonian .",
    "the self - energy , @xmath27 , is a pure local quantity that contains the information about disorder and local on - site interaction and has to be determined self - consistently .",
    "one can easily write an impurity action embedded in the effective medium by subtracting the local self - energy on site and adding back the exact interaction @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "the sites distinct from @xmath30 can be integrated out exactly because they enter quadratically in action and it now becomes @xmath31 with bath green function @xmath32 the self - consistency condition requires that the impurity green function embedded in effective medium has to coincide with the local medium green function and in case of alloy it can be written as properly weighted sum of green functions for different atomic species @xmath33 where @xmath34 one should note that the effective impurity green functions can be evaluated with any suitable technique . above set of equations has to be iterated until self - consistency with respect to self - energy is reached .",
    "the measurable quantities in presence of disorder are evaluated in the usual cpa way and are regarded as weighted sum of the local values @xmath35 where @xmath30 subscribe means that this is an average of operator @xmath36 for the certain type of atom in effective medium . therefore the internal energy of the system can be written as @xmath37 where @xmath38 correlator can be calculated within segment version of hybridization expansion continuous - time quantum monte carlo method  @xcite ( ct - qmc ) at no additional cost .",
    "we carried out the calculations of the specific heat for the binary alloy using the ct - qmc method  @xcite . in this case the the interaction contribution to the internal energy can be easily calculated with high precision and what is also important in our study that the low temperatures can be accessed .",

    "after the instant squared magnetic moment decreases rapidly with the temperature raise .",
    "this strong temperature dependence of the @xmath43 at these concentrations is reflected in the large temperature dependence of the corresponding energy term in the eq .",

    "one should note here that other terms in total energy ( eq .  [ eq : total_energy ] ) are of small temperature dependence and its contributions to the specific heat are negligible or about the same value for the different concentrations .",
    "the behavior of the specific heat can be also analyzed from the spectral properties view .",
    "for the pure hubbard model specific heat has no any features at small temperatures ( see inset of the fig .  [",
    "fig : dos_x=0 ] ) like in weakly correlated system  @xcite .",
    "indeed , at these values of interaction parameters and occupation , @xmath50 , the system is overdoped that one can see from the spectral function presented on the fig .",
    "[ fig : dos_x=0 ] . with increasing of the concentration , @xmath44 , the small peak starts to grow and it has maximum at the concentration , @xmath44=0.3 , than this peak becomes smaller and totally disappears at @xmath44=0.7 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cv ] ) . from the analysis of the spectral functions and its temperature dependence for @xmath44=0.3 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dos_x=0.3 ] ) one see that at @xmath47=0.005 the spectral function for the @xmath20 constituent is almost `` half - filled '' and has a quasiparticle peak .",
    "with increase of temperature the quasiparticle peak and low hubbard band are washed out in one structure and the small feature in the specific heat vanishes .",
    "the specific heat for the non - interacting binary alloy with the same local potentials does not show any features at @xmath47@xmath480.1 . hence , we can clearly associate this peak in specific heat with the local moments formed by on - site coulomb interaction .",
    "it should be noted that binary alloy with larger values of the coulomb parameters and disorder strength ( @xmath51 ) is insulator for the concentration equal to filling of the system , @xmath52  @xcite .",
    "this transition from weakly to strongly correlated state can be explained as follow .",
    "let suppose that there is a binary alloy with large disorder strength , @xmath53 , and interaction parameters that are also comparable with the bandwidth , @xmath54 .",
    "the filling , as in our case , is @xmath41=0.3 and is different from integer .",
    "when the concentration is equal to one we have a pure hubbard model , all @xmath20 sites are occupied by 0.3 electrons and the system is in weakly correlated regime due to overdoping . at decreasing the concentration the number of @xmath20 sites is decreased and the occupation , @xmath55 , is increased because the local potential of @xmath21 sites is higher in energy and they are almost empty .",
    "when the concentration becomes equal to the ( per site ) filling of the system the @xmath20 sites are close to half - filling , and thus , they are in strongly correlated regime .",
