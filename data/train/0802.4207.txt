    "in this case , set @xmath28 .",
    "we say that @xmath25 satisfies a functional equation if @xmath29 for some integers @xmath30 .",
    "in fact there is a well - defined notion of a functional equation even in cases in which the local zeta functions attached to an object are not almost uniform but rather are determined by counting rational points on certain varieties ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "we will impose conditions on @xmath19 that will imply that the local zeta functions are almost uniform .",
    "however , the question of uniformity for these integrals , in general , remains open .",
    "early interest in the function @xmath25 came from the fact that it is a natural generalization of the dedekind zeta function .",
    "indeed , the latter may be obtained by taking @xmath31 and @xmath2 the natural representation .",
    "it was studied in other special cases by hey , weil , tamagawa , satake and macdonald @xcite .",
    "tamagawa considered the case @xmath32 with the natural representation and showed that the global zeta function ( defined to be the product of the local zeta functions over all primes @xmath4 ) has meromorphic continuation to the whole of the complex plane . in (",
    "* chapter 6 ) the authors proved that for several families of classical groups , the global zeta functions have natural boundaries and thus can not be meromorphically continued . nevertheless , it remains interesting to ask which properties of the dedekind zeta function carry over to the function @xmath25 for all groups @xmath10 and representations @xmath2 .",
    "the question of whether the functions @xmath25 are ( almost ) uniform and satisfy functional equations was first addressed in a more general setting by igusa @xcite .",
    "he chose serre s canonical measure on @xmath10 , which differs from the haar measure used in our definition .",
    "he was able to derive an explicit form for @xmath25 in terms of @xmath15 and @xmath33 .",
    "this form involved a certain sum , over the weyl group @xmath5 of @xmath10 , of rational functions weighted by the length function on @xmath5 .",
    "igusa was able to utilize a symmetry of the weyl group together with reciprocities for the rational functions to prove that the local zeta functions satisfy functional equations for almost all primes .",
    "the main tool he employed was a @xmath34-adic bruhat decomposition due to iwahori and matsumoto @xcite .",
    "although his integral differed from our ours , the method he employed will be essential to our analysis .",
    "independent interest in the function @xmath35 was generated by @xcite , in which the authors showed that the zeta function in fact expresses a subgroup counting function in a completely different context .",
    "let @xmath36 be a finitely generated torsion - free nilpotent group ( or @xmath37-group ) and for @xmath38 define @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 denote the number of subgroups @xmath42 of @xmath36 of index @xmath43 satisfying @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively . here",
    "@xmath47 denotes the profinite completion .",
    "@xmath48 has been given no name to date ; we refer to it as the proisomorphic zeta function of @xmath36 .",
    "define local zeta functions for each prime @xmath49 by grunewald , segal and smith showed that for @xmath38 and for each prime @xmath49 , @xmath50 is a rational function in @xmath51 .",
    "they also showed that , as a straightforward consequence of nilpotency , the zeta function decomposes as an euler product : furthermore , they realized the local proisomorphic zeta function @xmath52 as the local zeta function @xmath53 of an algebraic group with an associated @xmath7-rational representation ( hence all such realizations are _ a fortiori _ rational functions in  @xmath51 ) .",
    "this prompted du sautoy and lubotzky to study @xmath25 with a view to ascertaining whether the local proisomorphic zeta functions @xmath52 would be uniform and whether they would satisfy functional equations .",
    "it is well - known that if @xmath54 is the connected component of @xmath10 then @xmath54 can be expressed as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the unipotent radical of @xmath54 and @xmath57 is a ( connected ) reductive subgroup ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . in @xcite du sautoy and lubotzky",
    "made a reduction to an integral over the subgroup @xmath57 and showed that the zeta function @xmath35 would be unchanged for almost all primes @xmath4 .",

    "they were also able to decompose the function @xmath59 into pieces defined relative to a normal series for @xmath56 ; this relied on a certain lifting assumption on @xmath54 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* assumption  2.3 ) , restated in our paper as condition  [ lifting condition ] ) .",
    "they further assumed that @xmath57 would split over @xmath1 , that @xmath59 would be ( the @xmath4-adic absolute value of ) a character on @xmath57 , that the rank of the maximal central torus of @xmath57 would be @xmath64 , and that among the irreducible components @xmath65 of @xmath66 there would be one whose dominant weight ` dominates ' the dominant weights of the other components .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a definition of the latter . under these assumptions , they were able to extend igusa s method to obtain an explicit form for the local zeta functions @xmath35 , deducing that they would be almost uniform in @xmath4 and would satisfy functional equations .",
    "we now state our main theorem .    [ main theorem ]",
    "let @xmath10 be an algebraic group defined over @xmath1 and let @xmath2 be a faithful @xmath1-rational representation @xmath67 .",
    "write @xmath68 , where @xmath54 is the connected component of @xmath10 , @xmath56 is its unipotent radical and @xmath57 is a connected reductive subgroup .",
    "suppose that , after fixing some suitable decomposition of the representation space , @xmath69 satisfies condition  [ lifting condition ] ( cf . section  [ reduction section ] ) for almost all primes @xmath4 .",
    "suppose further that @xmath57 splits over @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath70 denote the rank of the maximal central torus of @xmath54 and @xmath71 the number of irreducible components of @xmath66 .",
    "then    1 .",
    "the local zeta functions @xmath72 are almost uniform , i.e. uniform outside a finite set of primes 2 .   if @xmath73 , for almost all primes @xmath4 , @xmath72 satisfies the functional equation    fundamental roots of the root system associated to  @xmath57 , @xmath74 is a set of positive roots , and @xmath75 is a non - negative integer .",
    "if @xmath10 is reductive then @xmath76 .    for a faithful representation we necessarily have @xmath77 ( each irreducible component has a maximal central torus of rank @xmath64 or @xmath78 ;",
    "see @xcite ) .",
    "we will show in section  [ counterexample section ] that in one direction our result is best possible in the following sense : there exist groups @xmath10 and representations @xmath2 for which @xmath79 whose local zeta functions do not satisfy functional equations in the sense of ( [ equation fn eq ] ) .",
    "a more complicated counterexample has in fact been given previously by martin @xcite .",
    "he studied the integral as defined by igusa for a certain @xmath80-dimensional irreducible representation of @xmath81 . here , since @xmath82 , we infer from our theorem  [ main theorem ] that it is the different choice of measure in this example ( namely the canonical measure ) that is responsible for the break - down of the functional equation .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ main theorem ] relies on the splitting assumption to utilize a @xmath4-adic bruhat decomposition of iwahori - matsumoto .",
    "as suggested in @xcite , it may be possible to remove this assumption using the notion of a @xmath4-adic decomposition for non - split reductive groups due to bruhat and tits ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "condition  [ lifting condition ] is needed to reduce to the case of a reductive group , and can not easily be removed without a deeper understanding of the action of the reductive subgroup on the unipotent radical , as described below . in the case that @xmath10 is reductive , condition  [ lifting condition ] holds trivially . we thus obtain the following .",
    "if @xmath10 is a @xmath1-split reductive group defined over @xmath1 with faithful @xmath1-rational representation @xmath2 then its local zeta functions satisfy statements ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of theorem  [ main theorem ] .",
    "our theorem generalizes ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  6.1 ) as follows .",
    "we allow the maximal central torus to have arbitrary rank and we no longer make the assumption that the function @xmath59 is ( the @xmath4-adic absolute value of ) a character on @xmath57 .",
    "we do not assume that there is any relationship between the dominant weights of the irreducible components of @xmath66 ; rather , we restrict the number of components to @xmath70 , the rank of the maximal central torus of @xmath57 . in @xcite , the authors proved a functional equation in the case that @xmath83 , @xmath71 is arbitrary and among the dominant weights of the irreducible components of the representation , there is one which ` dominates ' all the others .",
    "note that our theorem  [ main theorem ]  ( 2 ) does not reduce to their theorem  a  ( 2 ) under their assumptions .",
    "in fact their proof of the latter is flawed , which we will explain at the end of section  [ functional equation subsection ] .",
    "however , in the case @xmath84 their proof is valid and their result becomes a special case of our theorem  [ main theorem ]  ( 2 ) .",
    "the functional equation in part ( 2 ) of our main theorem comes , as in igusa s setting , from an interplay between symmetries of the weyl group associated to the algebraic group , and reciprocities of the generating functions in the weighted sum .",
    "however , in our case these generating functions are not just geometric series ( as in @xcite and @xcite ) ; rather , they are certain generalized generating functions over subsets of a polyhedral cone .",
    "the reciprocity property we use to prove the functional equation is an extension of a reciprocity theorem due to stanley ( * ? ? ? * theorem  4.6.14 ) .",
    "our proof relies crucially on the fact that the cone is simple . by this",
    "we mean that the set of lattice points it contains is freely generated as a commutative monoid ( note that a simple cone is , in particular , simplicial ) .",
    "the simplicity of the cone is in turn a consequence of the condition @xmath73 .",
    "indeed , it is this insight that enables us to construct our counterexamples in section  [ counterexample section ]",
    ". an important feature of our combinatorial data is the existence of a ` minimal vector ' in corollary  [ fn eq corollary ] below , in a similar vein to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 4.6.16 ) , although our case is slightly different due to the presence of internal structure in the cone .",
    "our proof of a functional equation is reminiscent of @xcite , where the generating functions varied in different cells defined by linear forms ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition  2.1 ) ) . in (",
    "* theorem  a ) , the authors considered sums of generating functions possessing ` inversion properties ' analogous to lemma  [ inversion of a cell lemma ] in the present paper , weighted by the numbers of non - degenerate flags in a finite formed space . while the settings are all different , they share a common feature in utilizing both combinatorial reciprocity properties and symmetries of a weyl or coxeter group to prove a functional equation ( as is the case also in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we now explain why we have included condition  [ lifting condition ] in theorem  [ main theorem ] and how this relates to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  6.1 ) . in @xcite",
    ", the authors analyzed the automorphism group of @xmath85 , the lie algebra of upper triangular 4 by 4 matrices , together with a natural representation , and showed that in this case @xmath59 ( defined in ( [ definition first of theta ] ) ) is only a ` piecewise ' character .",
    "specifically , they were able to divide the domain of integration into two regions such that @xmath59 was a character on each . in section  [ reduction section ] we will make this notion of ` piecewise characters ' more precise and show that @xmath59 will be a piecewise character provided that @xmath86 satisfies condition  [ lifting condition ] .",
    "we need this property of @xmath59 in order to carry out our analysis of the reduced integral expression for @xmath72 given in ( [ equation dusl reduction ] ) .",
    "since the condition is somewhat technical , we postpone a proper description of it until section  [ reduction section ] . roughly speaking",
    ", the condition states that quotients of @xmath87 by certain normal subgroups @xmath88 of the unipotent radical , together with natural representations @xmath89 , enjoy the property that integral points of @xmath90 defined with respect to @xmath91 lift to integral points of @xmath87 with respect to  @xmath2 .",
    "corollary  4.5 in @xcite states that our condition  [ lifting condition ] is satisfied for almost all  @xmath4 .",
    "this is in fact incorrect .",
    "for instance , if @xmath10 is taken to be the automorphism group of @xmath92 and @xmath2 the representation with respect to the standard basis for @xmath92 , it can be checked by a straightforward calculation that condition  [ lifting condition ] fails to be satisfied for all primes @xmath4 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , a correct formulation of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  6.1 ) requires condition  [ lifting condition ] just as our theorem  [ main theorem ] does .    motivated by the examples presented in section  [ counterexample section ] , we ask the following .",
