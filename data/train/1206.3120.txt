    "we establish a number of fundamental convexity properties of the rate region of 802.11 wlans .",
    "firstly , we establish a simple constraint that determines the station transmission attempt probabilities on the rate region boundary .",
    "secondly , we show that , while the rate region is non - convex , its complement in the positive orthant is strictly convex .",
    "this property is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : rateregion ] where the shaded area indicates the rate region and the unshaded area above the rate region boundary indicates its complement in the positive orthant .",
    "thirdly , we obtain a complete and explicit characterisation of the maximal convex subsets of the rate region , two such subsets being indicated by the hashed areas in fig .",
    "[ fig : rateregion ] .",
    "it is important to note here that `` obvious '' constraints do not yield convex subsets of the rate region , let alone maximal subsets .",
    "examples of constraints for which it is straightforward to show ( proofs omitted due to lack of space ) that convexity does not result ( for wlans with @xmath0 stations ) include :    1 .   constraining the maximum transmission attempt probabilities , _",
    "i.e. _ enforcing @xmath1 for station @xmath2 ; 2 .   constraining the maximum value of @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the number of stations in the wlan ; 3 .   constraining the maximum value of the wlan collision probability ; 4 .   constraining the minimum value of the wlan idle probability @xmath5 .",
    "our results complement the recent observation in @xcite that the 802.11 rate region is log - convex . as well as being of interest in their own",
    "right , our results provide the basis for applying powerful convex optimisation methods to the analysis and design of fair throughput allocations for 802.11 wlans  we discuss this in more detail in section [ sec : opt ] below .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "we first introduce our network model in section [ sec : nm ] , then consider the rate region boundary in section [ sec : rr ] . in section [ sec : convexity ] we establish that the complement of the rate region is strictly convex and in section [ sec : maximal ] characterise the maximal convex subsets of the rate region .",
    "we summarise our conclusions in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "the 802.11e standard extends and subsumes the standard 802.11 dcf ( distributed coordinated function ) contention mechanism by allowing the adjustment of mac parameters that were previously fixed , including @xmath6 ( called @xmath7 in 802.11e ) , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "in addition , 802.11e adds a txop mechanism that specifies the duration during which a station can keep transmitting without releasing the channel once it wins a transmission opportunity . in order not to release the channel",
    ", a sifs interval is inserted between each frame - ack pair .",
    "a successful transmission round consists of multiple frames and acks . by adjusting this time",
    ", the number of framess that may be transmitted by a station at each transmission opportunity can be controlled .",
    "a salient feature of the txop operation is that , if a large txop is assigned and there are not enough packets to be transmitted , the txop period is ended immediately to avoid wasting bandwidth .",
    "we consider an 802.11e wlan with @xmath4 stations . as described in @xcite , we divide time into mac slots , where each mac slot may consist either of a phy idle slot , a successful transmission or a colliding transmission ( where more than one station attempts to transmit simultaneously )",
    ". let @xmath10 denote the probability that station @xmath2 attempts a transmission .",
    "the mean throughput of station @xmath2 is @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15^t$ ] , @xmath16 is the mean number of bits sent by station @xmath2 in a successful transmission , @xmath17 is the phy idle slot duration , @xmath18 is the mean duration of a successful transmission by station @xmath2 and @xmath19 the mean duration of a collision .",
    "note that @xmath18 and @xmath16 are allowed to depend on the station to encompass situations where stations may transmit different sized txop bursts on winning a transmission opportunity .",
    "we will assume that frame transmissions are of duration @xmath19 , in which case the collision duration @xmath19 is invariant with the station attempt probabilities @xmath10 ( if stations use frames of different duration then the duration of a collision would depend on the specific set of stations involved in a collision and so on the attempt probabilities ) .",
    "a txop burst by station @xmath2 consists of a sequence of @xmath20 frame transmissions each of duration @xmath19 and @xmath21 is the size , in bits , of the payload of each frame .",
    "we suppose that there are upper / lower bounds on the admissible txop burst size , _ i.e. _ @xmath22 .",
    "it will prove useful to work in terms of the quantity @xmath23 rather than @xmath10  observe that @xmath24 for @xmath25 . with this transformation",
    "we have that @xmath26 and @xmath27 and @xmath28 where @xmath29 with @xmath30 . for a fixed @xmath17 , the throughputs scale with @xmath19",

    "it can be verified that @xmath52 is monotonically increasing in the txop burst sizes @xmath53 .",
    "therefore at the rate region boundary we must have @xmath54 .",
    "it can also be verified by inspection of the second derivative that @xmath52 is a concave function of @xmath49 and so has a unique turning point . to determine the turning point of @xmath55 ,",
    "differentiating @xmath52 with respect to @xmath49 yields @xmath56 and setting this derivative equal to zero we have that the @xmath57 corresponding to the turning point is the unique positive root of @xmath58 substituting , we therefore have that the turning point ( _ i.e. _ , the boundary of the rate - region ) satisfies @xmath59 where @xmath60 , as stated in the lemma .",

    "in this section we briefly illustrate use of the results of the previous sections in the design of fair throughput allocations in mesh networks of 802.11 wlans . in previous work",
    "@xcite we established the log - convexity of the rate - region of mesh networks of 802.11 wlans . by working in terms of log - transformed rates , this then implies that one can use the network - utility - maximization ( num ) framework of kelly  @xcite for the class of utility functions @xmath126 such that @xmath127 is concave .",
    "the commonly used iso - elastic / constant relative risk aversion family of utility functions  @xcite given by @xmath128 satisfy the above requirement only when @xmath129 .",
    "the requirement that @xmath127 is concave when @xmath126 is already concave is a stringent one and excludes from consideration many families of utility functions used by economists to model user behaviours  @xcite .",

    "for suitable parameter settings these families have the decreasing absolute risk aversion property  @xcite , they have @xmath140 and are increasing and concave , and therefore fit empirically observed user behaviours  @xcite . yet for most parameter settings @xmath127 is not a concave function for these families , and thus utility optimisation can not be addressed via the approach in @xcite . since the original motivation for the num framework  @xcite was to bring in economic considerations to rate allocation in networks , this potentially represents a major deficiency that can addressed using the results in the present paper . with this in mind , we can revisit the setting in @xcite of a mesh network formed from 802.11 wlans / cliques created using appropriate frequency assignment .",
    "using theorem  [ th : main ] we can work in an appropriate convex subset of the rate - region of the network .",
    "for this we assume that an appropriate operating point on the boundary is chosen for each wlan / clique , the subset rate - region is then an intersection of polytopes given by and the theory from @xcite directly applies .",
    "we illustrate this using a specific network with three flows shown in figure  [ fig : example ] and using two utility functions from the power risk aversion family  @xcite , namely , @xmath141 and @xmath142 giving @xmath143 , and @xmath144 and @xmath142 giving @xmath145 .",
    "we will compare this with the @xmath146 utility function corresponding to proportional fairness . in all cliques",
    "we assume that @xmath147 and that the txop value is set to 1 , i.e. , its minimum possible value . for flow 1",
    "we assume that @xmath148 corresponds to 12 mbps wherever the flow is active ; the corresponding numbers for flow 2 and flow 3 are assumed to be 6 mbps and 12 mbps , respectively . from symmetry of the problem",
