    "@xmath11 , the system is no longer integrable .",
    "we find that even a small degree of asymmetry has a dramatic effect on the motion of the body .",
    "the equations of the symmetric loaded sphere are identical to those governing the motion of the tippe - top , which has been studied extensively ( see @xcite for a comprehensive reference list ) . however , in the case of the tippe - top , the angular momentum about the principal axis with maximum moment of inertia is large , and sliding friction plays a key role . in the case under consideration here",
    ", we are interested in solutions where the angular velocity remains moderate and there is pure rolling contact .",
    "there are two characteristic modes of behaviour : pure rocking motion in a vertical plane , and pure circular rolling motion .",
    "the general motion has aspects of both these special cases , which leads us to name the body the _ _ .    .",
    "]    this investigation arose from the observation of the oscillations of a glass candle holder , spherical in form with an opening at the top . for a more systematic study",
    ", we constructed a larger and more massive body by removing a polar cap from a bowling ball to produce a truncated sphere ( figure  [ fig : bowlingball ] ) .",
    "as long as the tilting angle is such that the geometric centre is vertically above the contact point , the dynamics are equivalent to those of a loaded sphere .",
    "it was found that when the ball was tilted over to an angle of about @xmath12 , it rocked back and forth but also precessed through an azimuthal angle that alternately increased and decreased .",
    "this unexpected and surprising _ recession _ , or reversal of precession , demanded an explanation in terms of dynamics .    we will show that for a symmetric loaded sphere reversal of the precession is impossible .",
    "this raises the question : what factor is missing from our dynamical model ?",
    "we rule out sliding friction , since the motion is gentle with no evidence of slipping .",
    "random perturbations , due to the imperfect shape of the ball or irregularities of the underlying surface , were not considered as a likely cause of the behaviour , as experiments indicated that the recession was quite a robust feature of the motion .",
    "although bowling balls are manufactured to high tolerence , and deviations from perfect sphericity must be very small , slight anomalies in the mass distribution are unavoidable .",
    "moreover , the recesses in the physical body remaining from the finger holes introduce some asymmetry ( figure  [ fig : bowlingball ] ) .",
    "we were thus led to study the dynamics when the inertial symmetry @xmath4 is broken .",
    "we find that even a minute deviation from symmetry changes the behaviour of the numerical solution profoundly .",

    "we base our analysis on the existence of critical lines dividing the @xmath5 plane into four dynamically disjoint zones .",

    "given that there are two symmetries in the problem , invariance under addition of arbitrary constants to either @xmath83 or @xmath84 , we might expect two invariants in addition to the total energy .",
    "for general initial conditions , there are three constants of integration .",
    "they are the total energy , jellett s constant and routh s constant ( see @xcite for a complete derivation of these constants ) .",

    "we will show in the next section that recession , or reversal of precession , implies in particular that @xmath93 and @xmath94 at a given angle @xmath67 systematically change their sign as time evolves . therefore , in the symmetric case it is impossible to have recession for routh s sphere .",
    "we can use the constants of motion to reduce the system to a single equation for the tilting angle @xmath67 .",
    "we use routh s constant ( [ eq : routh ] ) to obtain @xmath96",

    "( we will occasionally use the _ visible half - angle _ @xmath116 , which gives more illustrative plots in the case of the ( asymmetric ) ) .",
