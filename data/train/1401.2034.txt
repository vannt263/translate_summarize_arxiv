    "along the last few decades an increasing number of scholars has been contributing to develop a coherent and further integral body of knowledge on complex real world systems .",
    "cross - fertilization of concepts and tools stemming from dynamical systems , statistical physics and information and computation theories has allowed to identify and analyse systems whose observable behaviors result from similar underlying mechanisms @xcite . as a result of these attempts ,",
    "a key finding has been realization of the ubiquity of nonlinear feedbacks in the dynamics of different classes of systems .    in particular ,",
    "the occurence of drastic , qualitative shifts of the functioning regime of systems as resulting from strong positive and negative feedbacks has attracted interest in diverse research fields , as diverse as microscopic physical systems at equilibrium @xcite and their macroscopic non - equilibrium counterpart @xcite , ecology @xcite , socio - physics @xcite and earth system science @xcite .",
    "insights into the phenomenology , related to regime shifts and the development of new methods for their early detection , have relied on minimal models .",
    "a frequent idea in this approach is to cast the description of the system evolution as a stochastic differential equation @xcite , of the form : @xmath0 the key variables of the system are represented as a vector @xmath1 and their dynamic interrelationships are considered as deterministic laws , described as a vector field * f*. vector @xmath2 aims at introducing the effect of incessant perturbations on the * x * components , as typically resulting from endogenous meso - scale dynamic complexity and from an infinite number of uncorrelated environmental factors .",
    "consequently , @xmath2 is assimilated to a gaussian wiener process @xcite with standard deviation @xmath3 .",
    "the parameter @xmath4 controls the qualitative behavior of solutions to the deterministic part of system around a stationary state @xmath5 . in this framework",
    ", a regime shift is represented as a local bifurcation occuring in the deterministic part of the system at a critical point @xmath6 , i.e. , that the jacobian matrix of * f * , evaluated at @xmath7 , possesses one eigenvalue whose real part tends to zero as @xmath4 approaches the value @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "thereby , the response of the system to random fluctuations can be studied along the evolution towards the bifurcation point .    given the relevance of applications and implications of regime shifts in real world systems ,",
    "it is of increasing interest to construct early warning indicators ( * ewi * ) @xcite  with focus on identifying statistical signatures of the loss of stability in the time series generated by the evolution of the system towards criticality .",
    "conjointly , a relevant phenomenon is the slowing down of the fast stabilizing dynamic modes often referred as critical slowing down .",
    "this results from the real part of the leading eigenvalue becoming zero as the system closely approaches the bifurcation point @xcite .",
    "as illustrated in a pioneering work by s. carpenter @xcite on * ewi*-based monitoring of shallow lake ecosystems , the onset of the critical slowing down can lead to a drastic increase in the variance of a variable of the system .",
    "more recently , the skewness @xcite , kurtosis@xcite and the autocorrelation function @xcite of a system variable have been shown to capture relevant information on the increased loss of stability close to the bifurcation point .",
    "the literature in early warning detection is rapidly expanding and their potential applications within a broad range of real world problems is being discussed @xcite . within this contextual frame ,",
    "it becomes natural to inquire about the possible long - term complex behavior that would arise if * * ewi**s are repeatedly used to control systems potentially undergoing regime shifts .",
    "as far as we know , this question remains open , in the light of earlier and further recent advanced methods in the construction of * ewi * s @xcite .    in order to tackle this question",
    ", we propose to analyze the dynamics of a system represented by subject to a control process .",
    "the basic idea is that such a steering control should : 1 ) re - establish the stability of the system before it crosses a critical point , or 2 ) re - establish a lost initial system regime once a critical point has been crossed , to then let the system evolve again towards criticality .",
    "let us explore this idea by considering a control system which reacts upon the behavior of an * ewi * , denoted by @xmath9 , whose construction is based on information about the past states of the system within a sliding observation time window of size @xmath10 . in other words , we are interested in analyzing the coupled dynamics of with an evolution equation for @xmath4 , of the form @xmath11 here we require the control functional @xmath12 to operate a change of sign , at the level of @xmath13 , once @xmath9 crosses a reference value @xmath14 . in order to allow for differences in the degree of sensitivity of the control system , let us consider the control response to changes in the ratio @xmath15 as modulated by a parameter @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , let us assume that the control response may exhibit random variability as a result of the influence of many uncorrelated factors .",
    "thus , we denote by @xmath17 a gaussian wiener process with standard deviation @xmath18 .    in the domain of application of * * ewi**s , relevant cases are those where the control variable @xmath4 is driven by human interventions . in many of these instances ,",
    "the evolution of the system towards criticality is the result of an `` exploitation '' process , that is sought to be intensified and mantained , while avoiding a system regime shift .",
    "consider for instance catching rates in sustainable fisheries @xcite , agriculture related leaching rates of phosphorus into a shallow lake , whose oligotrophic regime is to be preserved @xcite , or the increase in the autocatalytic production of chemical species in a well - stirred reactor @xcite , where a low entropy production regime may be desirable .",
    "consequently , we characterize the dynamics of system - in terms of two phases : * _ exploitation _ * if @xmath19 and _ * recovery * _ if @xmath20 .",
    "central questions for us are :    * the role of the time - scale @xmath10 , considered for the construction of the * * ewi**s , in shaping the emergence of control properties in a system - . * the long - term complex dynamics that can result from the temporal non - locality introduced by the * ewi * into the dynamics of the coupled system - . in other words , in the long - term , the control exerts changes on the system on the basis of the past dynamics of the system and its control as a whole .",
    "this opens the possibility to observe different complex behaviors , as the effective dimension of the system - control is augmented by its dependency on the past . * the efficiency of the control process in terms of : its capacity to increase and mantain explotation in a selected regime as a function of the observation window @xmath10 , of the control response sensitivity @xmath16 and of the variance of stochastic perturbations @xmath21 and @xmath18 .",
    "in sec.ii we address these questions , by exploring numerically the performance of control on minimal dynamical systems of generic character , that reproduce the prototypical phenomena of bistability and oscillations .",
    "each of these controlled systems is first studied in absence of noise , in order to reveal the role of the observation time scale in shaping the leading deterministic dynamics . upon the basis of the insights",
    "thereby generated , for each system , we introduce a suitable measure of control efficiency .",
    "subsequently , we address the influence of the variance of noise , for different observation time windows and different degrees of control response , on the efficiency of both systems under consideration .",

    "regardless of the complexity of its dynamics , as a system evolves further into the vicinity of a bifurcation point , there is a decrease in the number of degrees of freedom necessary to effectively describe the dynamics .",
    "this remarkable fact can be understood as a direct consequence of the gradual run out of the fast - relaxation dynamic modes that occurs along with the critical slowing down .",
    "a corner stone in local bifurcation theory is the application of the centre manifold method @xcite to identifying canonical descriptions of the nonlinear behavior around a bifurcation point , in terms of a reduced number of variables that contain the whole information about the dynamics of the slow leading modes .",
    "such simple representations so called normal forms describe the long - term behavior of the normalized amplitude of the stable solutions that emerge at criticality .",
    "the importance of normal forms lies on the fact that the dynamics of different types of systems , around the critical point , can be mapped one - to - one continuously onto the one displayed by a normal form @xcite .",
    "this property a property known as topological equivalence allows to define classes of universality , where near the critical point , the dynamics of systems belonging to the same class can be mapped onto each other by a change of variables preserving the direction of trajectories .",

    "as pointed out in @xcite , the phenomenology observed in so called catasrophic regime shifts in different types of systems can be suitably assimilated with a saddle - node bifurcation . as a parameter evolves ,",
    "a saddle - node bifurcation occurs when a stable ( node ) and an unstable ( saddle ) fixed point solution , to the deterministic evolution law of the system , approach each other and anhihilate upon meeting .",
    "this entails the destabilization of the system , which is thus led to an abrupt runaway this constitutes a catastrophic regime shift .",
    "however , since in real systems unbounded runaways are ruled out , saddle - node bifurcations are typically found in cases where the branch formed by the system fixed points folds upon itself , within a range of values in the control parameter @xmath4 ( see fig.[bif]a ) .",
    "the presence of such a folding entails the existence of a region where two stable solution branches coalesce along with an unstable one . in this picture",
    ", the unstable branch marks the boundary line between the two basins of attraction , associated to both stable branches . in general",
    ", the distance between the bifurcation points at the extremes of the s - shape folding ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 in fig.[bif]b ) is determined by a second paramater @xmath25 .",
    "examples of such a bistability are reported in different types of systems , ranging from laser and cell division , to ecoystems and climate @xcite .    in order to explore the question of bifurcation control in the context of bistability ,",

    "the position of the saddle - node bifurcation points @xmath54 are determined by the relation @xmath55 .",
    "accordingly , both branches approach each other and merge as @xmath25 tends to zero , at the so - called cusp bifurcation point ( fig.[bif]b ) .",
    "a similar behavior occurs when changing the sign in the second term in , which amounts to inverting the s - shaped folding .",
    "we carry out the numerical integration of the variance - based cusp - control system ( * ccs * ) ( [ eqgen1 ] ) , ( [ eqgen2 ] ) , ( [ control ] and [ cusp ] ) via a standard euler - maruyama approximation @xcite .      in order to illustrate the dynamics of the * ccs * in absence of noise ( @xmath42 ) , let us consider exploitation as initially occuring along the negative branch in fig.[bif]a , a moderate degree of control response @xmath56 ( see fig.[bif]c ) and a small variance reference threshold @xmath47 .    according to the numerical results , we distinguish three basic long - term * ccs * behaviors :    * _ exploitation runaway _ : if the time window is small as compared to a critical value @xmath57 , the system crosses the bifurcation point @xmath23 and a regime shift occurs . as the system is expelled onto the upper branch , the control mechanism reacts to the overshooting of the reference value @xmath14 .",
    "this triggers a recovery stage ( @xmath20 ) along the upper branch .",
    "however , as the system evolves along the upper branch , it eventually losses completely the `` memory '' on the original low branch regime . as a result ,",
    "the variance decreases gradually below @xmath14 , recovering is interrupted and the * ccs * switches to runaway explotation ( red lines in figs.[traj]a , b ) . * _ hysteretic pathways _ : when the observation window is now greater than the critical value @xmath57 , a transition occurs , from runaway exploitation to long - term control . for specific @xmath10-ranges",

    "however , differently from * b1 * , the upper branch recovering continues further and the bifurcation point @xmath24 is crossed .",
    "thus , the system undergoes again a regime shift towards the original lower branch . as the system stability increases and information about the upper branch is lost , the * ccs * eventually switches to exploitation , beyond @xmath23 ( green lines in figs.[traj]a , b ) .",
    "this exploitation - recovery process is mantained in the long - term .",
    "processes describing cycles along the zone of bistability are commonly refered as hysteretic .",
    "figure [ traj]c depicts the long - term hysteretic exploitation - recovery process , as a function of the proximity to the critical value @xmath8 corresponding to the bifurcation point @xmath23 . * _ branch - confined pathways _ : for large @xmath10 values , escapes to the upper branch are supressed and the system remains oscillating aperiodically without crossing the bifurcation point @xmath23 ( blue line , figs.[traj]a , b ) .",
    "this aperiodic dynamics is predictable in the sense that the average growth of an initially small deviation around a reference state @xcite is sub - exponential ( not shown ) .",

    "however , the highest efficiency peaks are slightly lowered when augmenting the intensity of noise at the level of control .",
    "for all the control response cases , when increasing @xmath10 the corresponding efficiencies tend to converge to a same low value , independently of the intensity of noise in control .",
    "finally , in presence of strong fluctuations at the level of the dynamics of both the system and the control ( i.e. @xmath104 ) , the efficiency rises towards a plateau for larger values of @xmath10 . in this case",
    "it is observed that the presence of strong fluctuations enhances the control efficiency and to a greater extent in the cases of high and moderate control response .",
    "in this work we addressed the variance - based control of systems evolving towards criticality .",
    "as testbed models we considered the cusp and hopf normal forms , displaying the prototypical phenomena of bistability and oscillations , respectively .    in relation to the core questions",
    "* _ i)_**_iii ) _ * exposed in sec .",
    "i , our main results can be summarized as follows :    * _ i ) _ * in absence of noise , effective control in both the cusp and the hopf systems rises above a threshold value in the size of the observation time window .    * _ ii ) _ * in the cusp - control system , changes in the observation time window provide a means to selecting among different control pathways , namely , hysteretic , branch - confined control , as well as an intermittent combination of both .",
    "the branch - confined regime becomes dominant when considering a large observation window .",
    "this entails an increase in the complexity of the dynamics , in the form of aperiodic control - system trajectories . in the case of the hopf - control system ,",
    "the crossing of the bifurcation point could not be avoided , for the range of paramaters explored . instead , as the observation time window",
    "is enlarged , exploitation and recovery phases occur for longer periods .",
    "this gives rise to the alternace of time intervals where oscillations are suppressed , followed by amplified oscillations .",
    "_ * iii ) * _ in both systems , random fluctuations , at the level of the system variables , enhance the efficiency of control , and especially for large observation time windows . in the case of the cusp - control system , the intensity of noise induces a control pathway selection , similarly as in the deterministic case when varying the observation time window . from the deterministic to the strong fluctuations cases , the efficiency of the cusp - control system tends to increase for large values in the size of the observation window . in the hopf - control system ,",
    "an increase in the intensity of noise induces a reduction in the amplitude of oscillations , which entails an increase in the control efficiency .",
    "random fluctuations at the level of the control dynamics exert opposite influences on the control efficiency of the cusp and hopf control systems . in the former it increases , while for the latter it tends to diminish the peak of efficiency . for both cusp and hopf control systems",
    ", the combination of fluctuations in the control and in the system dynamics amplifies the efficiency in particular for large observation time windows . regarding the interplay between the efficiency , the degree of control response , the intensity of noise , and the observation time window , we observe : in both systems , the low control response case exhibits a low efficiency , independently of the intensity of noise and observation window .",
    "when increasing the variance of fluctuations in the dynamics of the cusp system , a moderate control response leads to a higher efficiency ; the opposite situation occurs when considering fluctuations on the control dynamics . in the hopf system ,",
    "the moderate and high control response perform very similar , regardless the intensity of noise and size of the time window . in this situation , for both moderate and high response cases",
    ", the efficiency converges to the lower value associated with a low control response , as the observation time window is increased .    for the systems here addressed , it remains to be studied the influence of other parameters , such as the rate of change in the control system ( @xmath37 ) , the control reference parameter ( @xmath14 ) , as well as alternative approaches towards bifurcation , such as variation of the parameter @xmath25 in the cusp map which would induce flickering patterns at the vicinity of the critical point .",
    "potential applications of this approach to real world systems include ecosystem models , non - equilibrium mesoscopic physico - chemical systems or non - equilibrium models in economics , among others .",
    "similarly , it is of interest to extend this work to address the control properties associated to different alternative early warning indicators .",
    "moreover , our analisis could be extended to address the control of coupled systems , forming networks whose nodes consist in dynamical systems subject to control .",
    "certainly , the structure of the evolution equations of real world models , involving a large number of parameters , lacks the degree of symmetry that confers to normal forms their characteristic simplicity .",
    "moreover , not every dynamical system exhibiting a bifurcation belongs to a class of universality .",
    "it is thus important to address further the relation between the observation time scales leading to effective control and the geometrical properties , such as the curvature , of the system solution branches , while considering different early warning indicators .",
