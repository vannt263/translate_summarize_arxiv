    "positronium is a bound state of electron and positron . in this paper",
    ", we will be interested in the triplet state , orthopositronium , whose decay rate into @xmath1 has been precisely measured : @xmath2    the corresponding theoretical predictions which include perturbative qed corrections to a non - relativistic treatment of the bound state wavefunction have been computed also with high accuracy ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) : @xmath3 \\\\ & = & \\left ( 7.0382+b_{o}0.39\\times 10^{-4}\\right ) \\,\\,\\,\\mu \\sec ^{-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath4 , @xmath5 the fine structure constant and @xmath6 the electron mass .",
    "recent theoretical efforts have focused on a more complete evaluation of the non - logarithmic @xmath0 perturbative corrections , with the result @xmath7 @xcite or , equivalently @xmath8 this result renders the theoretical prediction still closer to the experimental measurement of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "positronium is a test ground for bound state treatment in quantum field theory .",
    "the first try dates back to the @xmath9 , with decay rates expressed through a factorized formula @xcite @xmath10 with @xmath11 the schrdinger positronium wavefunction at the origin , @xmath12 the total cross section for @xmath13 and @xmath14 the relative velocity of @xmath15 and @xmath16 in their center of mass frame .",
    "since then , more sophisticated decay amplitudes have been constructed , and systematic procedures for calculating corrections have been developed @xcite .",
    "however , the basic factorization of the bound state dynamics from the annihilation process has remained as a basic postulate . for low order corrections ,",
    "this approximation is unquestionable , but for @xmath17 corrections , factorization has to be tested",
    ". indeed , non - perturbative phenomena responsible for the off - shellness of the electron and positron inside the positronium are of @xmath18 . in other words , to get a sensible theoretical prediction at @xmath19 , one must carefully analyze how binding energy effects enter the general factorization approach .    in a recent paper @xcite",
    ", we showed that the factorization of the bound state dynamics from the annihilation process can be given a firm grounding through dispersion relations . from a fully relativistic model",
    ", we recovered the standard factorized amplitudes used in the literature , and found some forgotten @xmath19 contributions .",
    "those amplitudes are gauge invariant , since they are expressed in terms of scattering amplitudes for _ on - shell _ @xmath20 . when applied to orthopositronium",
    ", however , the appearance of those on - shell intermediate leptons brings infrared singularities @xcite , giving an incorrect analytical behaviour to the amplitude @xmath21-@xmath22 . indeed",
    ", basic principles require that this amplitude vanishes in the soft photon limit , since it involves only neutral bosons @xcite .",
    "one must conclude that the standard approaches are not complete and that they can only approximately describe the positronium decay .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to restore the analytical behaviour of positronium decay amplitudes .",
    "the relativistic model we used in @xcite to describe @xmath23-@xmath24 has the correct analytical behaviour when applied to @xmath21-@xmath22 since only off - shell constituents appear . indeed",
    ", we will find along with the known factorized - type amplitudes already found for parapositronium , a whole class of non - factorizable processes which enforce the positronium decay amplitude to vanish in the soft photon limit .",
    "those new amplitudes were absent for @xmath23-@xmath24 , but will contribute to @xmath21-@xmath25 at @xmath19 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first give a brief description of the derivation of factorized amplitudes from our relativistic model .",
    "then we analyze the simple decay @xmath23-@xmath26 , and show in detail how the analytical behaviour of the amplitude is restored by new contributions .",
    "finally , we discuss the orthopositronium decay to three photons and describe all the new contributions . in the appendix , we present a short discussion of the decay @xmath27 , the hadronic counterpart of the decay @xmath23-@xmath26 , in order to show the generality of the arguments developed for electromagnetic bound states .",
    "here we briefly review the recently proposed method @xcite to derive factorized amplitudes for bound state decays .",
    "the decay rates for positronium are calculated in a loop model .",
    "the positronium first decays into a virtual electron - positron pair , which subsequently annihilates into real or virtual photons ( an odd number for ortho - states , an even number for para - states ) .",
    "the coupling of the positronium to its constituents is described by a form factor , denoted by @xmath28 .",
    "it is not assumed to be a constant , since a constant form factor would amount to consider positronium as a point - like state .    in our model ,",
    "the decay amplitudes are ( see for example figure 4 ) @xmath29 for parapositronium ( pseudoscalar ) and orthopositronium ( vector , with polarization @xmath30 ) respectively .",
    "the @xmath31 is the scattering amplitude for off - shell @xmath20 with incoming momenta @xmath32 and @xmath33 into the final state @xmath34 , @xmath6 is the electron mass , @xmath35 the positronium four - momentum and @xmath36 . from these amplitudes ,",
    "the decay widths are calculated as @xmath37 with @xmath38 the positronium mass .",
    "what we have shown in our previous article @xcite is that when one expresses the loop integration in ( [ paradec ] ) or ( [ orthodec ] ) via a dispersion relation ( @xcite , @xcite ) , one ends up with a factorized convolution - type amplitude , i.e. for parapositronium : @xmath39 with @xmath40 the bound state wavefunction , @xmath41 the reduced scattering amplitude for _ on - shell _ @xmath20 with momenta @xmath42 and @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( @xmath38 is the positronium mass ) .",
    "the analogous form for orthopositronium decay is obtained using the substitution @xmath46 .",
    "the form factor @xmath47 is related with @xmath48 through @xmath49 with @xmath50 , @xmath11 being the schrdinger wavefunction at the origin , and @xmath51 ( related to the binding energy and fine - structure constant through @xmath52 ) .",
    "the present section concerns paradimuonium , the singlet @xmath54 bound state @xcite .",
    "this state has not been observed yet .",
    "the reason to consider the decay @xmath23-@xmath26 is that it is the simplest process where a photon is kinematically allowed to have a vanishing energy .",
    "therefore , we will be able to test whether the proposed factorization procedure ( [ finalstd ] ) gives a correct analytical behaviour to the amplitude in the soft photon limit .",
    "the simplicity of the process comes from the pseudoscalar nature of the paradimuonium , which allows a manifestly gauge invariant treatment throughout .",
    "note that the positronium decay @xmath23-@xmath55 via a @xmath56 has the same dynamics . after having analyzed this simple decay",
    ", we will be ready to tackle the more interesting process @xmath21-@xmath57 .",
    "the decay @xmath23-@xmath58 is shown in figure 1 .",
    "when the form factor @xmath47 appearing at the vertex @xmath23-@xmath59 allows a change of variable @xmath60 , the two amplitudes can be combined into @xmath61 with @xmath62 the reduced photon energy , @xmath38 the dimuonium mass and @xmath6 the muon mass .  the loop integral , which can be viewed as an effective form factor , is given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "gauge invariance is ensured by the factorized tensor structure , i.e. by the antisymmetric levi - civita tensor .",
    "@xmath66 is given by the same expression as the two - photon decay integral we encountered previously @xcite , the only difference being that @xmath67 .",
    "the differential width is given by @xmath68 with the phase space factor @xmath69 \\frac{x^{3}}{\\left ( 1-x\\right ) ^{2}}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 , and the bounds on @xmath71 are @xmath72 $ ]",
    ".    we are going to calculate the integral @xmath73 using dispersion relations .",
    "the main difference with the two - photon decay case is the appearance of two different cuts ( figure 2 ) .",
    "we have shown @xcite that considering the vertical cuts is strictly equivalent to the decay amplitude calculation done using formula ( [ finalstd ] ) where @xmath74 is the scattering amplitude @xmath75 with on - shell muons .",
    "standard approaches found in the literature are then obtained by making an @xmath0 approximation in ( [ finalstd ] ) .",
    "obviously , those approaches completely miss the oblique cuts .",
    "what we are going to show is that those forgotten cuts contribute at the order of @xmath76 , and more importantly , that _ the amplitude for _",
    "_  has a correct soft - photon limit behaviour only if we take all the cuts into account__. by this we mean that each cut gives a contribution to the amplitude that behaves as a constant when the photon energy goes to zero .",
    "the combination of the vertical and oblique cuts , on the contrary , forces the amplitude to vanish in that limit .",
    "we thus recover the analytical behaviour expected from low s theorem @xcite for the decay of @xmath23-@xmath77 involving only neutral bosons ( for @xmath23-@xmath78 , infrared divergences can not arise from electron bremsstrahlung processes due to selection rules ) .      to keep the discussion as general as possible",
    ", we extract the imaginary part of @xmath79 without specifying the form factor @xmath47 .",
    "the absorptive part is found by cutting the relevant propagators as @xmath80 for the vertical and oblique cuts , respectively . by a straightforward integration ,",
    "the first expression gives ( @xmath81 ) : @xmath82 \\theta \\left ( s-4m^{2}\\right )   \\label{cut1imaginary}\\ ] ] while the second one can not be completely integrated without specifying @xmath28 : @xmath83 with the bounds given by @xmath84    interestingly , the second cuts contribute for @xmath85 .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the two - photon decay , since there only the first cuts exist .",
    "further , approximated bound state wavefunction where a @xmath86 appears can not be used ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and one should revert to the full four - dimensional bethe - salpeter wavefunction ( for example the barbieri - remiddi one @xcite ) .",
    "let us now demonstrate an important point , i.e. that in the soft photon limit , the combination @xmath87 behaves as a constant when @xmath88 despite the fact that each cut diverges in that limit .",
    "this will guarantee that the imaginary part of the whole amplitude vanishes in the soft photon limit thanks to the presence of @xmath89 in the tensor structure of ( [ tensorfactor ] ) .",
    "this behaviour is what one expects from low s theorem @xcite .",
    "for all the form factors we considered , the behaviour of the combination @xmath90 when @xmath91 is summarized by : @xmath92\\ ] ] specifically , the form factors of interest are constructed from the schrdinger wavefunction ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let us recall their definition and give the limit obtained when using each of them : @xmath93 @xmath94 i.e. constant limits .",
    "remark that for a constant form factor @xmath95 ,",
    "the limit is simply @xmath96 it is easy to verify that this result is indeed what can be calculated from the imaginary parts : @xmath97@xmath98 \\theta \\left ( s-4m^{2}\\right ) -\\ln \\left [ \\frac{1+\\sqrt{1-\\frac{4m^{2}}{s\\left ( 1-x\\right ) } } } { 1-\\sqrt{1-\\frac{4m^{2}}{s\\left ( 1-x\\right ) } } } \\right ] \\theta \\left ( s-\\frac{4m^{2}}{1-x}\\right ) \\right ] \\end{array}\\ ] ]    in conclusion , the absorptive part of the amplitude is seen to vanish .",
    "thus , we expect that the dispersive part will also vanish in that limit .",
    "the oblique cuts , omitted from standard analyzes , are seen to be essential to maintain good analytical properties of the amplitude .    in the appendix ,",
    "the restoration of analyticity by a cancellation among the vertical and oblique cuts is presented in the context of the kaon decay @xmath99 via a charged pion loop . in this analysis ,",
    "the form factor describing the @xmath100 vertex is taken as a constant .",
    "this decay is interesting since there is a close similarity between this hadronic decay process and the present qed bound state decay .",
    "the main conclusion is that even if charged particles are present in intermediate states , the amplitude has to vanish in the soft photon limit , as expected from the fact that the decays @xmath101 or @xmath23-@xmath102 involve only neutral bosons .",
    "further , this @xmath103 decay provides a physically sensible process where one can analyze the constant form factor assumption , since for such a loosely bound system as the @xmath23-@xmath104 a constant form factor can not be realistic .",
    "we will now evaluate the contribution of each cut for the case of the schrdinger momentum wavefunction form factor @xmath105 in ( [ fiblimit ] ) . in doing so",
    ", we will gain a better understanding of the analyticity restoration at the level of the differential decay rate for @xmath23-@xmath106 .",
    "the purpose of the next sections is only illustrative , and the discussion can be straightforwardly transcribed for the advocated improved form factor @xmath107 ( [ fiiblimit ] ) ( see@xcite ) .      to precisely show what happens",
    "when the oblique cuts are forgotten , we compute here the rate with the vertical cuts only .",
    "the present derivation is therefore equivalent to standard analyses .    for our computation , we take the first cut imaginary part given by ( [ cut1imaginary ] ) . the real part is found through an unsubstracted dispersion relation with @xmath108 ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) : @xmath109   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{c\\phi _ { o}}{m^{3}}\\frac{1}{x}\\left [ \\frac{2}{\\pi } \\arctan \\frac{m}{% 2\\gamma } \\right ]   \\label{cut1real}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first equality holds since @xmath110 .",
    "remark that for @xmath111 , the second cuts vanish ( see [ cut2imaginary ] ) and ( [ cut1real ] ) reproduce the result obtained in @xcite for the parapositronium two - photon decay .    inserting the result for @xmath112 into the expression of the differential rate with @xmath113 and @xmath114 ,",
    "we get : @xmath115 note that , independently of the value for @xmath116 , the spectrum is always linear in @xmath71 due to the @xmath117 in ( [ cut1real ] ) .",
    "this is an incorrect soft photon behaviour since low s theorem requires a cubic spectrum instead @xcite ( when the amplitude behaves as @xmath71 , the rate @xmath118 and an additional @xmath71 comes from phase - space ) . by expanding the differential rate around @xmath119 ,",
    "we get @xmath120 as lowest order , we recover the standard result : @xmath121 note that the order @xmath5 corrections disappear when using the form factor @xmath107 ( see @xcite ) . for completeness , the total rate is simply : @xmath122 with @xmath123\\ ] ]      we have just seen that the vertical cuts suffice to reproduce the lowest order decay rate .",
    "it is interesting to investigate how the oblique cuts can restore the analytical behaviour of the spectrum without affecting this lowest order evaluation .",
    "the imaginary part corresponding to the oblique cuts is , from ( [ cut2imaginary ] ) , @xmath124 \\theta \\left ( s-\\frac{4m^{2}}{1-x}\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath125 , @xmath126 given in ( [ dispeegbounds ] ) and @xmath127 + \\frac{2}{m^{2}-s}\\ln \\left [ \\frac{\\left ( \\sqrt{s}+2q\\right ) ^{2}-m^{2}}{q^{2}}\\right]\\ ] ] we should now use an unsubstracted dispersion relation to get @xmath128 . this integral is quite complicated and not very interesting for the present purpose .",
    "instead , we revert to numerical evaluation of the dispersion integral for @xmath129 as a function of @xmath71 , and compare it to ( [ cut1real ] ) . in the figure 3",
    ", we plot the vertical cuts contribution ( dashed line ) @xmath130 and the complete result ( solid line ) @xmath131 \\\\ & = & \\frac{2}{\\pi } \\arctan \\frac{m}{2\\gamma } + \\frac{m\\gamma } { 2\\pi } \\int_{% \\frac{4m^{2}}{1-x}}^{+\\infty } \\frac{ds}{s - m^{2}}\\left [ \\mathcal{h}\\left ( q_{\\max } \\left ( x\\right ) \\right ) -\\mathcal{h}\\left ( q_{\\min } \\left ( x\\right ) \\right ) \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath132 ( i.e. @xmath133 ) and for @xmath134 ( @xmath135 ) . for @xmath91",
    ", one can verify that @xmath136 .",
    "the figures show that near zero the two cuts interfere destructively in order to maintain a correct analytical behaviour for the whole amplitude . away from @xmath137 ,",
    "the oblique cut contributions are strongly suppressed relatively to the vertical one , and this suppression increases as @xmath116 decreases ( @xmath138 when @xmath139 ) .",
    "as can be seen on the graph , it is typically for @xmath140 that the oblique cut contributes .",
    "therefore , we can summarize by giving a simple representation of the different contributions to the amplitude . from the figure 3",
    ", one can see that the behaviours of the vertical cuts , the oblique cuts and their combination are quite precisely modelled as @xmath141 as a consequence , the spectrum behaves as @xmath142 i.e. a linear spectrum when @xmath139 ( [ reusldiffcut1 ] ) , and a @xmath143 spectrum when @xmath71 is small .",
    "the effect of @xmath144 is therefore to soften the photon spectrum and slightly reduce the total width .",
    "this behaviour is exactly what we postulated in a previous work @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "the oblique cuts have a small contribution to the decay rate comparatively to the vertical cuts . however , their presence is essential to guarantee the analytical properties of the amplitude expected from low s theorem .",
    "further , when tackling @xmath19 corrections , one must include contributions from the oblique cuts .",
    "we now turn to the interesting decay @xmath21-@xmath145 . we start as usual with the loop model amplitude .",
    "dispersion techniques express that amplitude into separate contributions , arising from different cuts in figure 4 .",
    "since only off - shell intermediate leptons appear in the loop , the complete amplitude has a correct soft photon behaviour .",
    "this implies that one must consider all the cuts to preserve the analytical properties of the amplitude .",
    "this is one conclusion of the previous section .",
    "let us give the loop model amplitude @xmath146 where the vertex is given by six amplitudes grouped as @xmath147 with @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "the amplitudes in @xmath150 are shown on figure 4 . using charge - conjugation",
    ", we can show that the two drawn amplitudes are equal .",
    "the proof of this is in close analogy with the demonstration of furry s theorem , and requires a change of integration variable @xmath60 .",
    "this change is allowed for the form factor ( see ( [ fiblimit ] ) , ( [ fiiblimit ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , one can forget one term in each @xmath151 and multiply the other by @xmath152 . in the following , to keep the combinational as clear as possible",
    ", we will continue to consider all the six diagrams .",
    "let us now review the contributions aarising from the possible cuts in figure 4 .",
    "first we have the six vertical cuts shown on figure 5 .",
    "as demonstrated in the paper @xcite , those vertical cuts reproduce the known result : their combination is what is calculated with ( [ finalstd ] ) , i.e. at lowest order @xcite @xmath153 this result is obtained in the static limit , i.e. with @xmath154 .    if this limit is not taken , one has to go through the integration of the convolution - type amplitude ( [ finalstd ] ) .",
    "as explained in @xcite , the order of the corrections that will arise from that integration depends on the explicit form for @xmath47 .",
    "let us recall that for the parapositronium decay to two photons , we found that the form factors ( [ fiblimit ] ) led to @xmath155 corrections and higher , while ( [ fiiblimit ] ) gave corrections starting at @xmath0 .    finally , it is important to note that the six vertical cuts are separately gauge invariant since the scattering amplitude for on - shell @xmath156 is .",
    "the oblique cuts are depicted in figure 6 for the photon @xmath157 on the positronium side .",
    "similar cuts for the photon @xmath152 or @xmath158 singled out are easily drawn .",
    "the oblique cuts are not gauge invariant , contrary to the vertical ones . to see this",
    ", it suffices to note that each of these oblique cuts is , from the optical theorem , a product of a scattering amplitude @xmath159 times a bremsstrahlung amplitude @xmath21-@xmath160 .",
    "gauge invariance is broken by the bremsstrahlung amplitude , because the form factor is evaluated at different momenta for different cuts .",
    "to visualize the situation , let us change the momentum parametrization and draw amplitudes for @xmath21-@xmath161 as shown in figure 7 . obviously , when contracted by @xmath162 , the two amplitudes fail to cancel each other , due to the different momentum dependences of @xmath47 : @xmath163 and when contracted by @xmath164 : @xmath165 \\left\\ { \\overline{u}\\left ( p_{1}\\right ) \\gamma ^{\\alpha } v\\left ( p_{2}\\right ) \\right\\ } e_{\\alpha } \\left ( p\\right)\\ ] ] therefore , one should add to these diagrams the structure dependent amplitude @xmath166(figure 7 ) .",
    "the new direct coupling between @xmath21-@xmath167 and @xmath116 must be such that the combination of the bremsstrahlung graphs and this structure graph is gauge invariant .",
    "for the paradimuonium , we have not considered such structure terms because the amplitude was gauge invariant throughout thanks to the factorized tensor structure ( see ( [ tensorfactor ] ) ) .",
    "this is a peculiar feature of the two - photon decay of pseudoscalar positronium or dimuonium state .",
    "let us now turn to the soft photon behaviour .",
    "the structure terms do not alter the cancellation among cuts in the soft photon limit ( see the corresponding discussion for @xmath103 decay in the appendix ) .",
    "indeed , low s theorem applied to the bremsstrahlung plus structure dependent amplitudes gives the following expansion around @xmath168 ( see @xcite , @xcite ) :    @xmath169@xmath170 v\\left ( p_{2}\\right ) \\right\\ } e_{\\alpha } \\left ( p\\right ) + \\mathcal{o}\\left ( l_{1}\\right)\\ ] ] i.e. terms of order @xmath171 cancel because @xmath172 is gauge invariant .",
    "importantly , note that the form factor is now evaluated at @xmath173 , i.e. at the same point as for the vertical cuts .",
    "since for a constant form factor the combination of all the cuts necessarily behaves correctly in the soft photon limit , and since a momentum dependence in the form factor only modifies @xmath174 terms , the conclusion follows .",
    "remark that the appearance of these new structure contributions could have been guessed from the start , since the loop model amplitude ( [ looportho . ] ) fails to be gauge invariant due to momentum dependences in the form factor .",
    "more precisely , the ward identity @xmath175 is verified only if the form factor allows for linear changes of the integration variable like @xmath176 .",
    "a general form factor will not allow such shifts and one must supplement the loop model with new structure dependent amplitudes , as noted in @xcite .",
    "the dispersion technique we followed here is interesting since we get a more precise information on their origin , and we are able to constraint them through low s theorem .",
    "the same discussion can be made for the photons @xmath152 and @xmath158 .",
    "one ends up with twelve oblique cuts , to which six structure dependent amplitudes must be added .",
    "all these new contributions should become important at the order @xmath177 , so that one can really question the completeness of the results given in the literature @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the standard approaches used to calculate positronium decay rates can not be used to fully evaluate @xmath0 corrections . in the case of orthopositronium , many new contributions arise at that order from processes where the electron emerging from the bound state decay is off - shell .",
    "those contributions are essential to preserve the basic property of analyticity of the positronium decay amplitude , i.e. its vanishing in the soft photon limit .",
    "further , gauge invariance requires some interplay between the annihilation process and the bound state dynamics through structure dependent amplitudes .",
    "all these new contributions vanish in the static limit , i.e. when the form factor is replaced by a delta function @xmath178 .",
    "therefore , one can view these as non - perturbative effects arising from the binding of the constituents in the bound state .",
    "indeed , the size of the corrections is fixed by the @xmath179 appearing in the bound state wavefunction . concerning this wavefunction , forms where the dependence on the energy @xmath180 is replaced by a @xmath86 should not be used because it is specifically for non - zero value of the energy that the additional diagrams contribute .",
    "this raises the question of the form for @xmath47 to be used .",
    "let us recall that in @xcite , we advoquate the use of the improved form factor @xmath107 instead of the usual schrdinger momentum wavefunction .    in conclusion , it should now be clear that @xmath0 corrections as given in the literature are rather incomplete .",
    "a lot of work is still needed before a definite theoretical prediction up to that order can be compared to experiment .",
    "even if the theoretical basis seems settled , the orthopositronium life - time puzzle remains an open question .",

    ". therefore , the gauge invariance of the amplitude becomes manifest :        to calculate @xmath197 , we shall use dispersion relations ( see for example @xcite , @xcite ) . a direct integration is possible , but we shall gain insight into the dynamics of the process by using dispersion techniques .",

    "further , one can see that in the soft photon limit @xmath213 ( or @xmath214 ) , @xmath215 behaves as a constant .",

    "hence the result is conveniently expressed as ( [ resultfgfab ] ) with @xmath239 had we chosen to analytically continue @xmath240 and @xmath241 in the lower half complex plane , their imaginary parts would have had the opposite sign .",
    "one can verify from ( [ resultfab ] ) that the upper half complex plane analytic continuation reproduces @xmath215 as given in ( [ imfab ] ) .",
    "this result corresponds to @xcite where a sign mistake has to be corrected , and to @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the differential decay width is given by @xmath242 .",
    "after a straightforward integration over the electron - positron phase - space , we get the differential rate in terms of the reduced photon energy @xmath193 : @xmath243 \\frac{\\omega ^{3}}{\\left ( 1-\\omega \\right ) ^{2}}\\ ] ] with @xmath244 and @xmath245 .",

    "let us turn to the soft photon behaviour of the differential width .",
    "we have to analyze the loop integral function @xmath251 .",
    "this function tends to a constant for very low @xmath193 : @xmath254 ( note that for @xmath255 , the imaginary part of ( [ softlimit ] ) is the same as in ( [ imsoftlim ] ) ) .",
    "let us emphasize the strong cancellation between the two cuts in the soft photon limit .",
    "individually , each cut diverges as @xmath256 , but their combination is convergent . since the rest of the amplitude tends to zero like @xmath193 ( due to the @xmath257 $ ] factor ) , _ low s theorem is verified : the amplitude behaves as _ @xmath193 _ _  near _ _",
    "@xmath258__. _ _ the resulting spectrum is thus in @xmath259 ( @xmath256 from the squared amplitude and a @xmath193 from phase space ) . in other words , if we had forgotten one cut , the resulting spectrum behaviour would have been divergent as @xmath260 near zero instead of vanishing like @xmath261 .",
    "in fact , this @xmath261 spectrum is exactly the same as in the @xmath262 differential decay rate .      from the amplitude ( [ amplitude ] ) ,",
    "we readily obtain the amplitude for @xmath263 by removing the electron current , the photon propagator and by taking the limit @xmath264 : @xmath265 f\\left ( \\frac{m^{2}}{4m^{2}},0\\right)\\ ] ] with @xmath266 i.e. @xmath267 -\\frac{1}{2}\\left ( \\frac{1}{m^{2}}-\\frac{\\pi ^{2}}{m^{2}}+\\frac{1}{m^{2}}\\ln ^{2}\\left [ \\tfrac{1+\\sqrt{1-\\frac{4m^{2}}{% m^{2}}}}{1-\\sqrt{1-\\frac{4m^{2}}{m^{2}}}}\\right ] \\right ) \\right )   \\nonumber \\\\ & &   \\label{ftwophotons}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which corresponds to the result given in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the relative decay rate is : @xmath268 while the experimental value for this ratio is @xmath269 @xcite .",
    "we can now compare the two electromagnetic modes : @xmath270 in accordance with @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this ratio @xmath271 is similar to @xcite @xmath272 the small difference is due to the phase - space factor .",
    "the similarity between a constant coupling model like for @xmath273 and the present loop model can be understood from the behaviour of the photon energy spectrum .",
    "indeed , the pure phase - space spectrum is very strongly peaked at high @xmath193 , and therefore the decay rate is quite insensible to the detail of the @xmath274 function .",
    "specifically , if we replace @xmath275 by its value for @xmath276 ( [ ftwophotons ] ) we find the ratio @xmath277 , very close to ( [ rpipi ] ) .",
    "we now turn to the case of a non - constant amplitude @xmath278 .",
    "we analyze the process from the point of view of low s theorem .",
    "the constraint of gauge invariance will be seen to require some new structure dependent contributions .",
    "we will prove that those new contributions do not affect the interference between absorptive parts observed in previous sections , responsible for the vanishing of the amplitude in the soft photon limit .",
    "let us concentrate on the absorptive part of the amplitude for @xmath279 . using the optical theorem",
    "( see figure 2 ) , we write @xmath280 with @xmath281 the vertical cut contribution and @xmath282 the diagonal one : @xmath283    the @xmath284 amplitude is gauge invariant , as can be easily verified , and so is @xmath281 , independently of the form of @xmath285",
    ". therefore @xmath286 has to be gauge invariant too .",
    "the two bremsstrahlung contributions to @xmath287 are    @xmath288@xmath289 trivially , gauge invariance is verified if the form factor is constant.problems arise if @xmath290 , since when contracted by @xmath291 the two terms fail to cancel . to maintain gauge invariance",
    ", one must supplement the amplitude @xmath292 with a structure dependent term , for example @xmath293@xmath294 \\frac{% \\left ( p_{1}-p_{2}\\right ) ^{\\mu } } { p_{1}\\cdot k - p_{2}\\cdot k }   \\label{sdterm}\\ ] ] such that @xmath295 .",
    "let us now analyze the soft photon behaviour of this process .",
    "the form factor is expanded around @xmath296 as @xmath297 since we expect @xmath298 when evaluated on - shell , i.e. at @xmath299 .",
    "the amplitude is now @xmath300 + \\mathcal{o}\\left ( k\\right )   \\label{lowstruct}\\ ] ] i.e. the terms of order @xmath301 disappeared .",
    "this result is valid in full generality , it does not depend on the present structure dependent term ( [ sdterm ] ) chosen for illustration ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "now let us analyze the soft photon limit for the imaginary part ( [ imvd ] ) .",
    "we have obtained for the two cuts the structures @xmath302 \\\\ \\mathcal{d}^{\\mu } & = & \\mathcal{f}\\left ( p_{1}^{2},p_{2}^{2}\\right ) \\left [   \\frac{c^{\\mu } } { k}\\right ] + \\mathcal{o}\\left ( k\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] except for the @xmath303 terms in @xmath287 , this is exactly the soft photon expansion one would get for a constant form factor .",
    "hence we expect from the analyzes of previous sections that the combination will vanish when @xmath304 .",
    "note that it is essential that no constant term ( due to the momentum dependence of @xmath305 ) appears in @xmath306 .",
    "this was guaranteed by the gauge invariance of @xmath306 , which in turn necessitates the contribution of some structure dependent amplitude ."
