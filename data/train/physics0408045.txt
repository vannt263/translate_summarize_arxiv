    "in fact , the bilocally  approximated spft gives rise to the bruggeman homogenization formalism in the limit @xmath1 mlw00 .    in the following sections , we consider voigt wave propagation in a biaxial two  phase hcm within the context of the spft .",

    "thereby , we see that @xmath45 has a complex dependency upon the correlation length @xmath0 , with @xmath45 becoming equal to @xmath33 in the limit @xmath46 .",
    "in order to explore the possibility of voigt wave propagation    in any direction    it is expedient to consider the hcm relative permittivity dyadic in the rotated coordinate frame specified by the three euler angles @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 arfken . on rotation , @xmath45 transforms to @xmath50 wherein @xmath51    two conditions must be satisfied in order for voigt waves to propagate along the @xmath52 axis gl01 :    * @xmath53 , and * @xmath54 .    in terms of the relative permittivity scalars on the right side of ( which are all implicit functions of @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) , @xmath55 and @xmath56",
    "the numerical calculations proceed in two stages : firstly , @xmath45 is estimated using the bilocally approximated spft for a representative example ; secondly , the quantities @xmath57 and @xmath58 are calculated as functions of the euler angles .",
    "in particular , the @xmath59 angular coordinates of the zeros of @xmath60 , and the corresponding values of @xmath61 at those @xmath62 coordinates , are sought .",
    "the @xmath49 angular coordinate is disregarded since propagation parallel to the @xmath52 axis ( of the rotated coordinate system ) is independent of rotation about that axis .",
    "the following constitutive parameters were selected for the component phases @xmath7 and @xmath8 for all results presented here : @xmath63 with the dissipation parameter @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "the volume fraction @xmath65 for all calculations .",
    "consider the four relative permittivity scalars , @xmath66 , in the unrotated reference frame , i.e. , @xmath67 .",
    "the @xmath66 values calculated with the dissipation parameter @xmath68 are plotted in figure  [ fig1 ] , as functions of the orientation angle @xmath12 of component phase @xmath7 and the relative correlation length @xmath69 . at @xmath70 ( and also at @xmath71 ) , the preferred axes of both component phases are aligned .",
    "accordingly , the hcm is uniaxial with @xmath72 . for @xmath73 ( and also @xmath74 ) ,",
    "the hcm is biaxial .",
    "as @xmath75 , the hcm biaxial structure becomes orthorhombic since @xmath76 . for intermediate values of @xmath77 , the hcm has the general non  orthorhombic biaxial form mw_biax2 .",
    "the correlation length is found to have only a marginal influence on @xmath66 for @xmath78 .",
    "the hcm constitutive parameters corresponding to those of figure  [ fig1 ] , but arising from nondissipative component phases ( i.e. , @xmath79 ) , are presented in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the absence of dissipation in the component phases has little effect on the real parts of @xmath66 .",
    "however , the imaginary parts of @xmath66 are much altered .",
    "since the component phases are nondissipative , the imaginary parts of @xmath66 are null  valued at zero correlation length . as the correlation length increases , the loss due to the effects of coherent scattering becomes greater .",
    "hence , the magnitudes of the imaginary parts of @xmath66 are observed to increase in figure  [ fig2 ] as @xmath69 grows .",
    "furthermore , it is clear from figure  [ fig2 ] that the rate of increase of these imaginary parts is sensitively dependent upon the orientation angle @xmath12 of the component phase @xmath7 .",
    "the condition @xmath80 can be satisfied at two distinct hcm orientations .",
    "these orientations are denoted by the angular coordinates @xmath81 and @xmath82 . with the normalized correlation length fixed at @xmath83 , the @xmath84 and @xmath85",
    "angular coordinates are graphed as functions of @xmath12 in figure  [ fig3 ] for the dissipation parameter values @xmath86 and @xmath87 . in particular , observe that the two distinct solutions of @xmath88 exist even when the component material phases are nondissipative ( i.e. , @xmath79 )",
    ". the angular coordinates @xmath81 and @xmath89 are clearly sensitive to both @xmath12 and @xmath90 .",
    "values of @xmath91 , corresponding to the angular coordinates @xmath81 and @xmath89 of figure  [ fig3 ] , are plotted against @xmath12 in figure  [ fig4 ] . for @xmath92 , the magnitude @xmath93 .",
    "in particular , the inequality @xmath93 holds for @xmath79 ( which is not clearly illustrated in figure  [ fig4 ] due to limited resolution ) .",
    "therefore , voigt waves can propagate along two distinct singular axes in the biaxial hcm , as specified by the angular coordinates @xmath81 and @xmath82 , even when the hcm arises from nondissipative component phases .",
    "this conclusion stems solely from the incorporation of the correlation length in the spft , because the maxwell garnett and the bruggeman formalisms would not predict voigt wave propagation when both component phases are nondissipative ml03 .",
    "the two orientations that zero the value of @xmath60 , as specified by the angular coordinates @xmath81 and @xmath82 , are plotted against @xmath12 in figure  [ fig5 ] for the normalized correlation lengths @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the dissipation parameter is fixed at @xmath78 . as in figure",
    "[ fig3 ] , the two distinct directions described by @xmath81 and @xmath89 are sensitively dependent upon the orientation angle @xmath12 of the component phase @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , the two distinct directions persist in the limit @xmath96 .",
    "the influence of @xmath69 upon the angular coordinates @xmath81 and @xmath89 ( as illustrated in figure  [ fig5 ] ) is relatively minor in comparison with the influence of the dissipation parameter @xmath90 ( as illustrated in figure  [ fig3 ] ) .    for",
    "the angular coordinates @xmath81 and @xmath82 of figure  [ fig5 ] , the corresponding values of @xmath91 are presented in figure  [ fig6 ] as functions of @xmath12 . clearly , @xmath93 for @xmath92 when @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath69 has only a minor influence on @xmath91 .",
    "hence , the orientations of the singular axes , along which voigt waves may propagate in the biaxial hcm , are modulated only to a minor degree by the correlation length .",
    "the role of the correlation length in facilitating the propagation of voigt waves in hcms is delineated .",
    "thereby , the importance of taking higher  order distributional statistics in homogenization studies into account is further emphasized .",
    "specifically , we have demonstrated that    1 .",
    "voigt waves can propagate in hcms arising from nondissipative component phases , provided that a nonzero correlation length is accommodated , according to the spft .",
    "the orientations of singular axes in hcms are sensitively dependent upon ( i ) the degree of dissipation exhibited by the component phases and the ( ii ) the orientation of the preferred axes of the component material phases . by comparison ,",
