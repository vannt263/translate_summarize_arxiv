    "collimated and high velocity mass ejections are often associated with young stellar objects ( ysos ) , being a natural outcome of the protostellar accretion process . indeed , collimated jets have been observed in a variety of ysos of different evolutionary stages , from the embedded class 0 protostars to pre - main sequence classical t tauri stars ( ctts ) , although the excitation conditions , and consequently the suitable observational tracers , vary significantly for the different sources ( e.g. frank et al .",
    "jets from ctts have been investigated in the most detail , since they are optically visible and can be studied through several emission lines tracer of hot gas ( @xmath7 10@xmath8  k , e.g. hartigan et al .",
    "2007 ; podio et al . 2012 ) .",
    "more embedded class i sources are mainly observed in the near - ir . compared to ctt jets , class i jets are denser , colder and less ionized , showing also a significant molecular component ( e.g. davis et al .",
    "2011 , garcia lopez et al .",
    "2008 ) .    in the less evolved and heavily obscured class 0 objects jets",
    "are only sporadically detected in the sub - mm as collimated high velocity emission of co and sio gas at relatively low excitation ( @xmath9 100 - 300 k , e.g. gueth & guilloteau 1999 ; tafalla et al .",
    "2004 ; codella et al .",
    "2007 ; hirano et al . 2010 ) .",
    "most of the class 0 sources , however , are associated with large scale low velocity molecular co emission , tracing cavities or swept - up gas , without any clear evidence of the underlying jet or wind pushing away the ambient gas .",
    "the above scenario poses the following questions : what is the agent driving the large scale molecular outflows in class 0 sources ? is the low excitation collimated molecular jet seen in some class 0 sources dynamically important in the mass accretion / ejection balance ?",
    "why do only a few class 0 sources have collimated molecular jets ?    indeed , the study of jets in class 0 sources suffers from a strong observational bias .",
    "since these sources are still deeply embedded in their parental cloud , any optical / near - ir emission near the source escapes from detection .",
    "in addition , given the expected dense environment , it is likely that a significant part of the jet material is composed of neutral atomic gas at relatively low temperatures ( e.g. @xmath9 1000 - 4000 k ) whose emission lines fall in the mid- and far - ir spectral range .",
    "gas with such properties has been revealed by recent _ spitzer _",

    "in addition , the mass flux rate carried out by such a jet can give information on the ejection / accretion efficiency and , when compared to sources with different ages , its evolution .    among the tracers of low excitation atomic jets , the [ oi ] 63@xmath0 m line is expected to be the brightest , due to the high abundance of atomic oxygen and favorable excitation conditions . in particular , for pre - shock densities @xmath10 10@xmath11 @xmath12 the [ oi]63@xmath0 m line is predicted to be the main coolant in the original wind shock , i.e. the dissociative shock caused by the impact of the high velocity collimated wind ejected from the protostar on the surrounding material ( hollenbach & mckee 1989 ) . as such",

    "the morphology of the observed emission is described in section 3 , where we also discuss the kinematics of the [ oi]63@xmath0 m gas in the sources where the line has been resolved in velocity ( namely l1448-c , hh46  irs and bhr71  irs1 ) . in section 4",
    "we present the methods adopted to derive the mass flux rate carried out by the atomic gas traced by the [ oi]63@xmath0 m emission , discussing the associated uncertainty and assumptions .",
    "finally , in section 5 we discuss how the measured [ oi]63@xmath0 m mass flux rate can be related to the molecular outflow thrust and to the protostellar mass accretion rate .",
    "observations with the pacs instrument in the l1448 , ngc1333-iras4 , bhr71 and vla1623 regions were performed as part of the ot1 program _ probing the physics and dynamics of the hidden warm gas in the youngest protostellar outflows _ ( ot1@xmath15bnisini@xmath151 ) .",

    "table 1 provides the central coordinates of the maps together with distance of the region and luminosity of the outflow driving source considered in the analysis .",
    "pacs integral field unit ( ifu ) line spectroscopy was used in chopping / nodding mode to obtain spectral maps of the outflows at the [ oi ] transition @xmath16 ( 63.1852@xmath0 m observed in the second grating order ) . for the four outflows of the ot1@xmath15bnisini@xmath151 program , simultaneous observations of the @xmath17 ( 145.5254@xmath0 m ) transition ( in the first pacs grating order ) were also taken .",

    "have however shown that the pacs effective spectral resolution at 63@xmath0 m  could span from 100 to 130kms@xmath1 ( according to the pacs observer manual ) . to evaluate the instrumental fwhm in our observations ,",
    "we have extracted a [ oi]63@xmath0 m spectrum towards the pdr region located ne of vla1623 ( see appendix a ) , under the assumption that the intrinsic line - width is negligible ( i.e. below 10 kms@xmath1 ) .",
    "the linewidth of the unresolved line is on the order of 130kms@xmath1 , which we hereafter consider our instrumental limit .",
    "the data of the l1448 , ngc1333-iras4 , bhr71 and vla1623 sources were acquired with a sampling of 44kms@xmath1 per spectral element ( i.e. nyquist sampling at the nominal resolution ) .",
    "a factor of two higher spectral sampling was instead adopted for the observations of hh46 ( 22kms@xmath1 per spectral element ) .",
    "the observations were performed with a single scan cycle , providing an integration time per spectral resolution element of 30 sec .",
    "all the data were reduced with hipe v10.0 , where they were flat - fielded and flux - calibrated by comparison with observations of neptune .",
    "the flux calibration uncertainty amounts to around 20@xmath21 while the _ herschel _ pointing accuracy is @xmath9 2@xmath22 .",
    "finally , in - house idl routines were used to locally fit and remove the continuum emission and to construct integrated line maps .",
    "figures 1 - 5 show the [ oi]63@xmath0 m maps of the 5 five observed outflows .",
    "the morphology of the [ oi ]  145@xmath0 m line emission is very similar to that of the 63@xmath0 m  line but images have a lower s / n and will not be presented here .",
    "the 145@xmath0 m data will be used to estimate the gas density , as described in section 4.1.1 .. the main outflow properties and the general distribution of the [ oi]63@xmath0 m emission are discussed in appendix a. the obtained maps cover several protostars , most of them associated with their own outflow . here",
    "we discuss in more detail only the properties of the most prominent outflows in each region , and discuss the morphology and kinematics of the gas close to the central source , where we expect the emission to be connected with the presence of the atomic jet .    from figs 1 - 5",
    ", we see that in all sources the [ oi ] emission is spatially resolved close to the source and elongated in the direction of the outflow axis .",
    "the fwhm width in the direction perpendicular to the outflow is instead consistent with the width of the psf at 63@xmath0 m and thus it appears non resolved transversely .",
    "we therefore interpret the observed emission as coming from a collimated jet and/or from a series of shocked knots aligned along the outflow axis .    for each source , a spectrum from a rectangular region encompassing the [ oi ] jet emission has been extracted .",
    "table 2 summarizes the spatial extent of these regions together with the parameters measured for the [ oi ] line emission .",
    "the lsr line velocity and width at fwhm have been measured by fitting the spatially integrated [ oi]63@xmath0 m profile with a gaussian function . due to the factor @xmath9 3 lower spectral resolution at 145@xmath0 m",
    "this line is always unresolved , so we have not extracted any velocity information from its profile .",
    "the observed peak velocities in the integrated spectra are not centered at systemic velocity but span between -53kms@xmath1 ( in bhr71 ) and + 56kms@xmath1 ( in iras4a ) , i.e. values comparable with the spectral sampling .",
    "spurious wavelength shifts can also be caused by a misalignment of a point - like emitting source with respect to the spaxel center .",
    "although the observed emission is extended over several spaxels , and thus the wavelength shifts should be minimized , we conservatively assume that actual v@xmath23 of the [ oi]63@xmath0 m , averaged in the extracted spectra , is between the observed @xmath24 and the systemic velocity .    in l1448-c , bhr71  irs1 and hh46  irs the 63@xmath0 m line width is significantly larger than the pacs instrumental profile , indicating that the line is spectrally resolved with an intrinsic width ( measured as @xmath25 ) on the order of 110 , 90 and 130 kms@xmath1 for l1448 , bhr71 and hh46 , respectively .",
    "on the other hand , vla1623 and iras4a have line widths consistent with the instrumental profile and thus are not spectrally resolved .",
    "an enlargement of the region close to the driving source is also presented in figs 1 - 5 . here ,",
    "the [ oi ] emission , shown as contour plots , is superimposed on archival _ spitzer _ irac images and , when available , on h@xmath14o 179@xmath0 m herschel / pacs maps obtained together with the [ oi ] observations ( bjerkeli et al .",

    "the blue and red outflow lobes are spatially separated and are in agreement with the kinematics of the outflow as observed through mm tracers ( e.g. bachiller et al .",

    "are symmetrically displaced with respect to the central source , in a similar fashion as the high velocity mm / sub - mm co / sio emission associated with molecular jets ( e.g. bachiller et al . 1990 ; hirano et al . 2010 ; andr et al . 1990 ) . in iras4a ,",
    "peaks of [ oi]63@xmath0 m emission roughly coincide with peaks of the compact co(6 - 5 ) outflow mapped by yildiz et al .",
    "when compared with h@xmath14o , the [ oi ] emission shows remarkable differences in some of the sources .",
    "for instance in vla1623 and iras4a , [ oi ] does not peak towards the central source , at variance with h@xmath14o which peaks on - source in all the objects .",
    "this suggests that , at least for these sources , on - source most of the oxygen has been transformed into water by means of high temperature reactions or ice evaporation ( elitzur & de jong , 1978 ) .",
    "alternatively this could indicate that the jet , traced by oi and not by water , is presently not particularly active .",
    "the comparison of [ oi]63@xmath0 m with other molecular and atomic species can be seen in detail in l1448 , where maps of several tracers at different wavelengths are available .",
    "6 shows an [ oi ] line intensity cut along the outflow axis , compared with that of h@xmath14o 179@xmath26 m , the h@xmath14 17@xmath26 m and [ fe ii]28@xmath26 m lines ( from nisini et al . 2013 and neufeld et al .",

    "each line intensity is normalized with respect to its maximum .",

    "[ feii ] emission is also observed at zero velocity , but is not as strong as the [ oi ] , likely due to the extinction .",
    "the velocity channel maps are shown in fig .",

    ", we could derive the [ oi ] jet tangential velocity from the observed radial velocity assuming an outflow inclination angle .",
    "however , the limited pacs spectral resolution and the large uncertainty associated with the velocity measurement ( see section 3 ) prevent us from estimating @xmath28 directly from the pacs spectra .",

    "an estimate of the hydrogen particle density is obtained from the [ oi]63@xmath0m/[oi]145@xmath0 m line ratio , adopting a nlte code that considers the first five levels of oxygen .",

    "assuming that the [ oi ] emission originates in a jet with uniform density , the derived @xmath45(h ) limit would imply , for a density of 10@xmath8 @xmath12 , a jet diameter larger than 0.3 pc , which is clearly not consistent with observations .",
    "similar conclusions are reached if one assumes the colliders to be fully molecular .",
    "more significant could be the effect of [ oi]63@xmath0 m absorption by the cold gas along the line of sight , which would not be observed on the spectra due to the limited pacs spectral resolution .",
    "such an absorption should not affect the [ oi ] 145@xmath0 m , if we assume that the oxygen in the cold foreground gas is mostly populated in the ground level .",

    "more realistically , the emission we observe is caused by several unresolved shocks along the jet , having velocities smaller than the total jet velocity ( typical j - shock velocities in atomic jets from class ii sources are of the order of 30 - 40 kms@xmath1 i.e. about 3 - 6 times smaller than the jet velocities , e.g. hartigan et al .",
    "therefore one should in principle correct the above relationship for these effects , by multiplying it for the term ( v@xmath2/v@xmath55(1/@xmath56 ) ) , where @xmath56 is the number of shocks in the jet . under the reasonable assumption",
    "that in the considered jet sections the number of shocks is of the order of a few , the correction term should be of the order of unity and thus will not be further considered .    in table 3 , the values of mass flux rates computed from the hollenbach ( 1985 ) formula ( m@xmath57(oi ) ) are reported and compared with the previous estimates from line luminosity .",
    "these two independent methods give results which are in striking agreement each other , in spite of the different assumptions .",
    "this may however be not totally fortuitous since both methods are based on the [ oi]63@xmath0 m line luminosity .",
    "the main difference is that in one case the line theoretical emissivity is computed assuming specific physical conditions , while in the shock case it is assumed that [ oi ] is the main coolant in the post - shock gas for temperatures from @xmath9 5000 to @xmath9 300 k , and that each particle entering the shock radiates in the 63@xmath0 m line about 1.5@xmath58 with @xmath59 5000 k.",
    "the pacs observations reveal the presence of atomic collimated emission associated with the outflows of five class 0 sources .",
    "we wish to examine the role of this emission in the global energy budget of the protostellar system .",
    "in particular , we can estimate the m@xmath2(oi)/m@xmath6 ratio , with m@xmath6 the mass accretion rate onto the protostar , to evaluate the efficiency of the atomic jet in removing matter from the accreting system . at the same time",
    ", we can also discuss if this atomic jet possesses enough momentum to sustain the entrained large scale and powerful co outflows associated with the considered sources .",
    "measurements of m@xmath6 in class 0 sources are difficult and have a large uncertainty , because the accretion region is obscured from direct view by the optically thick massive envelope and because the already accumulated stellar mass is generally unknown .",
    "a rough estimate of m@xmath6 can be obtained by assuming that the source bolometric luminosity is dominated by accretion and that the mass of the central star is 0.2 m@xmath5 .",
    "this latter assumption is supported by recent interferometric observations of rotating disks in vla1623 and similar class 0 sources , inferring stellar masses around 0.2 m@xmath5 ( murillo et al .",

    "m@xmath2(oi)/m@xmath6 ratios is in the range 0.05 - 0.5 .",

    "the role of the [ oi ] jet on the overall outflow dynamics can also be addressed by comparing the [ oi ] mass flux with estimates of the outflow thrust ( or force , @xmath62 ) .",
    "this latter is usually inferred from millimeter observations of the co emission .",
    "derivation of @xmath62 is subject to a large uncertainty due to the different methods used to determine outflow mass and the different corrections for observational effects , such as opacity and inclination ( see e.g. downes & cabrit , 2007 , van der marel et al .",
    "if the outflow is driven by the underlying jet with momentum conservation , then the ( total ) jet mass loss rate and outflow thrust should be related by m@xmath2(co ) = @xmath62/v@xmath2 .",
    "v@xmath2 is the total jet velocity that can be estimated from the jet radial velocity and inclination angle following the same considerations adopted for the tangential velocity in appendix b. literature determinations of m@xmath2(co ) are reported in table 3 for each outflow ; the corresponding range of values in some cases spans up to an order of magnitude .",
    "the resulting m@xmath2(oi ) vs m@xmath2(co ) plot is shown in figure 12b : we note here that for two of the sources , namely ngc1333-iras4a and hh46 irs , the two mass loss determinations are consistent within the errors , indicating that the [ oi ] jet may have a role in driving the large scale outflow . for the other three sources , however , m@xmath2(oi ) is more than an order of magnitude smaller than the value needed to sustain the outflow , even taking into account the large m@xmath2(co ) uncertainty . comparing the results in figs .",
    "12 a and b , it appears clear that the mass flux derived from co in l1448 , vla1623 and bhr71 is in contradiction with the m@xmath6 estimated from their bolometric luminosity , since it implies m@xmath2(co)/m@xmath6 @xmath63 1 .",
    "therefore for these three sources either the m@xmath2(co ) is largely overestimated or m@xmath6 is underestimated , due for example to a central mass lower than assumed . in this latter case ,",
    "m@xmath2(oi ) in these three sources would be @xmath10 0.01 m@xmath6 , thus insufficient both to account for driving the outflow and to have a role in limiting the accreting material onto the star .    of the three sources , bhr71 has more uncertainty in the m@xmath2(co ) estimation , because the inclination of the outflow is poorly known and because there is the contamination by the secondary outflow from irs2 . in the case of the vla1623 outflow ,",
    "the larger error in the thrust determination comes from disentangling the outflow gas at low radial velocity from the envelope gas because of the low outflow inclination with respect to the plane of the sky .",

    "( 2010 ) assume that the protostellar mass should be in the range 0.03 - 0.09 m@xmath5 .",
    "time variability in the disk accretion rate could also be at the origin of the found discrepancy .",
    "we note that the co outflow of l1448 is peculiar with respect to the others , since it presents extreme high velocity ( ehv ) molecular gas in the form of co / sio collimated emission , corresponding to de - projected velocities of the order of about 200kms@xmath1 ( bachiller et al .",
    "1990 , hirano et al .",
    "interferometric mm observations of this emission suggest that it may be directly linked to the original protostellar jet and not to entrained material .",
    "this is also supported by the very different chemical composition of the ehv gas compared to the lower velocity outflow gas , pointing to a different origin of the two components ( tafalla et al .",
    "the above findings suggest that the primary jet responsible for driving the large scale low velocity outflow of l1448 is mainly molecular and that the atomic gas contributes only for a smaller part to the total jet momentum .",

    "this may suggest that also in these two sources the discrepancy between m@xmath2(co ) and m@xmath2(oi ) could be due to the fact that the atomic [ oi ] jet represents only a minor component of the original jet and that this latter is mainly composed of molecular material .",

    "this reinforces the result of fig .",
    "12 , i.e. that in this source the large scale outflow is mainly sustained from the low excitation neutral atomic jet traced by the [ oi]63@xmath0 m emission .",
    "the above findings are in line with the idea that jets undergo an evolution in their composition .",
    "jets in the youngest sources remain mainly molecular while the atomic component progressively becomes dominant , as the jet gas excitation and ionization increases .",

    "although pacs observations of a few t tauri stars indicate that the m@xmath2 derived from [ oi]63@xmath0 m is higher or comparable to the value derived from optical lines ( podio et al 2012 ) , these values should be considered as upper limits as [ oi ] emission in these evolved sources could be contaminated by pdr emission ( e.g. karska et al .",
