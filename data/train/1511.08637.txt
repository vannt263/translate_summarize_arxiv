    "in the recent years it has been demonstrated that ultracold atoms loaded in optical lattices provide an ideal realization of lattice hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "the control of the system parameters , in particular of the ratio between interactions and kinetic energy , has allowed the experimental achievement of the most famous mott insulator to superfluid phase transition in 2002 @xcite . from there on , the number of implementations of hubbard - like models using cold gases in optical lattices has undergone an incredible growth ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) : it is now possible to mimic single- and multi - species bose and fermi - hubbard models , extended hubbard models by using dipolar gases @xcite , and spin chain models @xcite .",
    "more recently , hubbard models characterised by non - trivial topology , synthetic magnetic field , artificial gauges @xcite , or synthetic dimensions @xcite have been realized .",
    "most of the theoretical studies on lattice hamiltonians regard many - body or single particle properties , especially in the case of non trivial topology . on the other hand ,",
    "lattice hamiltonians show interesting features also as far as the few body physics is concerned . indeed ,",
    "when the effect of interactions is combined with the presence of the lattice , composite objects on a lattice behave very differently with respect to their counterpart in free space @xcite .",
    "first of all the dispersion relation , i.e. the effective mass of bound particles depends on the binding energy .",
    "this is due to the impossibility in the lattice of separating the relative motion and the center - of - mass degrees of freedom .",
    "moreover the spectrum of the scattering states , the so - called essential spectrum , is bounded from below and from above .",
    "therefore bound states can exist both for attractive and for repulsive interactions @xcite .",
    "the existence of  exotic \" repulsive bound pairs ( rbp ) has been directly observed for the first time a few years ago for an ultra - cold bose gas in an optical lattice @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we consider two atoms with two coherently coupled internal levels in a one dimensional ( 1d ) optical lattice .",
    "the two - body properties of this system can be investigated analytically , allowing for a clear understanding of the interplay between the exchange term ( phase coupling ) and the intra- and inter - species interactions ( density coupling ) .",
    "the bound states of the system can be described in terms of a pseudo - spin wavefunction .",
    "thanks to its spinorial structure , the bound states can , in certain regimes , show the co - presence of repulsive and attractive character or the co - presence of free ( delocalized ) and bound ( localized ) nature .",
    "those features are absent in the single species situation .",
    "moreover , we show that an _ effetive momentum - dependent magnetic field _ emerges for the pseudo - spin of the dressed dimers , by means of a coupling between the internal state of the bound state and its center - of - mass motion .",
    "the emergent coupling between internal and external degrees of freedom for the bound states is due to the different dispersion relations of the bare dimers in the different coupling channels and is very easily understood in terms of dressed bound states .",
    "the same effect also emerges in a dimer of two distinguishable particles , provided that at least one of them possesses two coherently coupled internal levels .",

    "[ sec : lippmann - schwinger ] , we solve analytically our model via a lippmann - schwinger treatment .",
    "we investigate in detail the properties of the bound states and discuss the effect of bloch oscillations on the dimer pseudo - spin dynamics at the semiclassical level .",
    "we describe in detail the case of hybridized bound and scattering states , which are not present in the analogous single species model . in sect .",
    "[ asym ] , we generalize our results in the presence of species - dependent hopping and intra - species interaction and compare the effective model with exact diagonalization results . in sect .",
    "[ sec : distinguishable ] , we show that analogous results are obtained for dimers of two distinguishable particles , as long as one of them has two coherently coupled internal levels .",

    "therefore , a @xmath13-dependence of the internal state composition of dressed dimers is quite a general feature , not unique to the previously discussed system . in particular ,",
    "similar concepts can be applied to the case of two distinguishable particles , as long as at least one of them is characterised by two internal states , namely @xmath8 and @xmath9 coupled by an exchange term @xmath0 .",
    "let us called @xmath188 the state of the second species or isotope atom .",
    "interactions are characterized by the two coefficients @xmath189 and @xmath190 .",
    "the different terms of the 2-particle hubbard - like hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ full_h ] ) now read @xmath191 with @xmath192 . as in sect .",
    "[ sec : lippmann - schwinger ] , the convenient basis is provided by the two - body internal eigenstates of @xmath92 @xmath193 with eigenvalues @xmath194 .",
    "the eigenstates of the hamiltonian can be written as spinor wavefunctions @xmath195 with @xmath196 .",
    "provided that @xmath197 , the relative motion for @xmath198 is described again by eq .",
    "( [ discr_schr_tutto ] ) and interactions are now given by the @xmath199 matrix @xmath200 the analogy with the case described in detail in sect .",
    "[ sec : lippmann - schwinger ] is striking and similar conclusions can be reached .",
    "analogously , we can write an effective hamiltonian under the form @xmath201 where eq .",
    "( [ ebs0 ] ) with @xmath202 provides the diagonal elements .",
    "two different interaction couplings @xmath203 lead to @xmath13-dependent polarisation for the bound states as previously discussed . from the experimental point of view , considering two distinguishable particles could facilitate the realization of different interaction and hopping strengths .",
    "in this work we have investigated the bound states of two coherently coupled interacting bosons .",
    "we have shown an emerging momentum dependent polarisation due to the non separability of the centre of mass and relative coordinates .",
    "we have derived an effective hamiltonian , which has allowed us to give a direct interpretation of the coherently coupled system in terms of effectively coherently coupled bound states , and tested its validity against exact solutions based on the lippmann - schwinger equation and exact diagonalization .",
    "we have extended our study to the most general case where different tunneling parameters and interaction strengths for the two internal states are considered , in order to possibly access realistic experimental situations and found the conditions to optimize the correlations between internal and external degrees of freedom .",
    "the general character of our results has been stressed by introducing a similar model for two indistinguishable particles where only one needs to be dressed by a rabi coupling .    on the experimental side",
    ", many of the ingredients necessary to study the physics of spin - momentum coupling are already available .",
    "many experiments have been already realised for coherently coupled bose gas , starting from the seminal investigations in 1999 @xcite , to the josephson and classical bifurcation experiments @xcite , the realisation of polarisation dependent persistent currents @xcite , till the most recent experiments on spin - orbit coupling , artificial gauge fields and synthetic dimensions , where optical lattices are also present ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the most difficult issue is the possibility of realising large enough differences between intra- and inter - species interactions .",
    "indeed for the most commonly used @xmath204rb atoms , the difference is very small and feshbach resonances are difficult to implement .",
    "a possible idea would be to consider two different atomic species , as discussed at the end of this work .",
    "alternatively , one could lift the degeneracy of the hyperfine states in , e.g. the @xmath205 manifold and use spin - selective microwave pulses to couple the @xmath206 states in such a way to reduce the intra - species interaction leaving the inter - species unchanged @xcite .",
    "another possibility could be to work with spin - dependent lattices as recently shown in @xcite . in this configuration , aside from breaking @xmath39 symmetry , by changing the overlap between @xmath8 and @xmath9 species one could also sensibly tune the inter - species interaction .",
