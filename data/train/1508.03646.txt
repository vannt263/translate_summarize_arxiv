    "<S> this manifests itself in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : spectrumssh ] as the point where two momenta become imaginary .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusions and outlook : _ in conformal field theories the @xmath100 term in energy is universal and only depends on the central charge of the virasoro algebra@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we find that in the case of topological phase transitions this term naturally extends into a scaling function , depending only on the ratio of the system size to the correlation length . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore this scaling function is universal for all topologically non - trivial classes of non - interacting fermions in one spatial dimension . </S>",
    "<S> while the scaling function for energy appears to be sensitive to the topological nature of the transition , this is by no means the common situation . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the finite - size scaling function of the entanglement entropy away from the critical point@xcite , appears to be symmetric across the topological transition@xcite ( there is still an asymmetric size - independent boundary term ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it is natural to ask whether the scaling behavior changes with interactions , especially for models with central charge different from @xmath101 and @xmath102 considered here . </S>",
    "<S> another direction to explore is relation of the scaling function to the theory of integrable systems@xcite . in particular if it may be expressed in terms of solutions of painleve equations , as it happens in e.g. the ising model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned above , the non - analytic contributions to the finite - size scaling near @xmath81 are related to the monodromy , i.e. discontinuity across the branch cut terminating at @xmath81 , which happens to be simply a second order polynomial in @xmath56 . </S>",
