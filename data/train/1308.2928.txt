    "the advancement of experimental quantum information processing requires a method to benchmark errors on quantum gates .",
    "these benchmarks provide straightforward methods for comparing different experimental implementations and also establish compliance with error thresholds for processes such as error correction @xcite . the standard method for characterizing errors",
    "is quantum process tomography ( qpt ) @xcite , which provides complete error reconstruction . implementing qpt comes at a significant price though , since its complexity scales exponentially in order to determine the @xmath0 real parameters of the @xmath1-qubit quantum error process .",
    "in addition , qpt is vulnerable to state preparation and measurement ( spam ) errors , which are the errors associated with preparing and measuring different states . because these errors may be on the same order as the error on the gate of interest",
    ", they can cause significant inaccuracies in the reconstructed errors .",
    "a recent study found that qpt overestimated small errors by several orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "an alternative to qpt is randomized benchmarking ( rb ) @xcite .",
    "because this method extracts specific parameters of interest from the noise , as opposed to the complete set of parameters obtained from qpt , it does not suffer from exponential scaling .",
    "rb is also impervious to spam errors since it examines fidelity decays over random gate sequences .",
    "rb protocols have become an important tool for quantum verification and validation , and have been used to benchmark one- and two - qubit gates in atomic ion @xcite , nmr @xcite , and superconducting qubit @xcite experiments .",
    "rb protocols and their fidelity decay models are provably valid in a wide variety of scenarios , however assumptions about the form of the fidelity decay under complex noise models may introduce inaccuracies . as well , there have been concerns about the convergence of the estimate from finite sampling effects since typical experiments are performed with many fewer random sequences then predicted using the hoeffding bound  @xcite . for these reasons , it is important to study and develop new models in the limits where analytic support for current rb methods may be lacking .    in this paper ,",
    "we address many of these issues by providing new theoretical results on finite sampling effects and modeling decay curves for realistic types of noise . as well",
    ", we test the performance of rb in different scenarios by implementing numerical simulations of both standard  @xcite and interleaved  @xcite rb protocols under several physically relevant single - qubit error models .",
    "two main classes of noise were tested ; markovian and non - markovian .",
    "markovian noise is memory - less and as such is history - independent , while non - markovian noise is history - dependent , so the noise at one moment may depend on previous gates in the sequence .",
    "the first type of markovian noise we investigated was systematic rotations represented by both random and fixed unitary operators .",
    "these reflect the effects of gate calibration errors and control field fluctuations .",
    "the second type of markovian noise was amplitude damping , which can represent the process of spontaneous emission .",
    "the non - markovian noise we considered was @xmath2 noise and leakage to higher levels outside the qubit manifold .",
    "@xmath2 noise is ubiquitous in nature @xcite and is present to some degree in most physical implementations of qubits @xcite , although its relative importance is implementation dependent .",
    "leakage can plague a variety of systems , including transmons @xcite , phase - qubits @xcite , and quantum dots @xcite .",
    "we discuss new models of the fidelity decay curves for @xmath2 and leakage noise and perform numerical simulations under these models .",

    "the underlying idea behind an rb protocol is to apply sequences of randomly chosen gates from some group and measure fidelity decay as a function of sequence length  @xcite .",
    "ideally , this allows one to extract average properties of the errors associated with implementing these gates in real quantum devices . the standard protocol @xcite , which extends @xcite , chooses the gates from the clifford group and gives an estimate of the average gate fidelity , @xmath3 , or , equivalently , error rate over the group .",

    "while each randomized benchmarking protocol has a domain of validity for which it provably gives robust error estimates , we found that , in most cases analyzed , benchmarking provides better than a factor - of - two estimate of average error rate .",
    "this suggests that rb protocols can be utilized in quite general situations and thus are a valuable tool for verification and validation of quantum operations .",
    "we showed using both numerical and general theoretical results that the number of different random sequences in a benchmarking experiment can be much less than hoeffding bound estimates  @xcite .",
    "our theoretical method consisted of finding the non - linear least squares solution , linearizing the non - linear model around this solution , and constructing exact confidence intervals for the linearized multivariate model .",
    "we see that the size of the confidence intervals scales linearly with the standard error .    in the case of @xmath2 noise",
    ", we find that randomized benchmarking protocols produce a fidelity decay that can be modeled by a composition of correlated depolarizing channels .",
    "the degree of correlation can affect the extent to which a simple exponential decay is valid . for leakage errors , we devised a new protocol that allows for the estimation of gate errors under a sum of exponentials decay model .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of fidelity decays can be used as a measure of the extent to which leakage errors are present in an experiment .",
    "finally we showed that , in practice , the interleaved randomized benchmarking protocol provides bounds that are tighter than those theoretically predicted  @xcite .",
    "provided the error on the interleaved gate is not much smaller ( by a factor of 10 ) than the average error , the estimated error rate is a reliable quantity .",
