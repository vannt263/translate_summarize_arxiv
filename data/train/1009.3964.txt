    "the fact that the present model contains the type of solutions as described above in subsections [ a ] and [ b ] , indicates that the scalar field with non - minimally kinetic coupled terms , as presented here , could explain the dynamical origin of these ( mostly ) phenomenological models of dark energy . on the other hand , in order to obtain the above solutions ( see section [ a ] ) it was not necessary to introduce the matter term in the action .",

    "this means that the present model could explain the dynamical origin of many phenomenologically viable dark energy models .",
    "+ one relevant fact of this model , is that it contains solutions with eos that cross the phantom frontier , showing that the present model with non - minimal kinetic coupling is able to describe the quintom behavior .",
    "we also illustrated the time variation of the gravitational coupling for the relevant case of the @xmath0cdm solution .",

    "these conditions can be satisfied by imposing the inequalities @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "+ in conclusion , the derivative couplings provide an effective scalar density and pressure which might play an important role in the explanation of the dark energy or cosmological constant .",
