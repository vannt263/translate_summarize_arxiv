    "a major issue in strong interaction physics is to understand baryon spectroscopy .",
    "meson - baryon scattering has been the predominant reaction used to study the properties of nucleon resonances ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "an appealing alternative is to use electromagnetic probes , e.g. , @xmath7 . in this photon - induced process",
    ", the relative weakness of the electromagnetic interaction allows one to use first - order descriptions of the incident channel , thus making possible more reliable extraction of @xmath6 information from data . with the recent development of new facilities such as jefferson lab , elsa , graal , mami , and spring-8",
    ", it is now possible to obtain accurate data for meson electromagnetic production , including spin - dependent observables .    among meson photoproduction processes ,",
    "pion photoproduction is by far the most studied theoretically and experimentally .",
    "however , increased effort has also been devoted in recent years to investigate kaon photoproduction .",
    "such studies are motivated by several considerations : ( 1 ) the production of strangeness associated with kaons ( @xmath8 ) and hyperons ( @xmath9 ) allows one to study the role played by @xmath10 quarks versus @xmath11 and @xmath12 quarks ; ( 2 ) higher mass resonances can be better studied by investigating the @xmath13 and @xmath14 decays ; ( 3 ) the so - called `` missing resonances ''  @xcite predicted by quark models , but not observed in @xmath4 scattering , might be found in kaon photoproduction since they may couple strongly to @xmath15 and @xmath16 channels .    at photon laboratory energies from the kaon photoproduction threshold of @xmath17 1.61 gev to about 2.5 gev , the isobar model is most widely used for extracting @xmath6 parameters from the kaon photoproduction data  .",
    "this model is based on an effective lagrangian approach in which a number of tree diagrams are evaluated with coupling constants partly fixed from independent hadronic and electromagnetic data .",
    "although the isobar models describe the existing kaon photoproduction data fairly well , multi - step or coupled - channel ( cc ) effects due to intermediate @xmath4 states are ignored .",
    "the sequence @xmath18 in kaon photoproduction can be substantial , since @xmath19 amplitudes are much greater than the direct @xmath20 amplitudes .",
    "if this is indeed the case , the @xmath6 parameters obtained from one - step isobar models can not be directly compared with the predictions from existing hadron models .",
    "the importance of the final - state interaction(fsi ) in interpreting the @xmath21 resonant parameters extracted from @xmath19 data has been demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this work",
    ", we investigate the same problem concerning the role of cc final state interactions in kaon photoproduction .    among existing studies of kaon photoproduction",
    ", coupled - channel effects have been investigated using two approaches .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite applied a coupled - channel approach with chiral su(3 ) dynamics to investigate pion- and photon - induced meson production near the @xmath22 threshold .",
    "although their recent results  @xcite include p - wave multipoles , and thus reproduce data slightly above the threshold region , their chiral su(3 ) dynamics model can not provide the higher partial waves that are important in describing the data at higher energies .",
    "a similar approach has also been taken in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the second cc approach was developed by feuster and mosel  @xcite .",
    "they used a @xmath8-matrix method to investigate photon- and meson - induced reactions , including @xmath3 . in the @xmath8-matrix approach ,",
    "all intermediate states are put on - shell and hence the important off - shell dynamical effects can not be accounted for explicitly .",
    "the advantage of their approach is its numerical simplicity in handling a large number of coupled channels .",
    "however , the extracted @xmath6 parameters may suffer from the difficulties in interpreting them in terms of extant hadron models , such as the constituent quark model .    in this paper",
    ", we present a dynamical cc model in which the meson - baryon off - shell interactions are defined in terms of effective lagrangians .",
    "this is achieved by a direct extension of the existing dynamical models  @xcite for pion photoproduction to include @xmath22 channels .",
    "we follow the approach developed by sato and lee  @xcite . in this first attempt",
    ", we do however need to make several simplifications since it is a rather complex task to deal simultaneously with the meson - baryon and photon - baryon intertwined cc problems .",
    "first , we adopt an existing isobar model developed earlier by williams , ji and cotanch ( wjc )  @xcite as initial input for the direct @xmath23 process .",
    "this fixes the number of @xmath6 to be considered and the leading tree - diagrams associated with strange particles .",
    "second , we use the @xmath19 and @xmath24 partial - wave amplitudes from the vpi partial - wave analysis  @xcite to define the amplitudes associated with the @xmath4 channel .",
    "this drastically reduces the amount of data we have to confront in the coupled - channel approach .",
    "however , the strong interaction matrix elements of @xmath25 and @xmath26 transition operators are derived rigorously from effective lagrangians using the unitary transformation method of ref .",
    "this derivation marks our major differences with kaiser _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite since we include all relevant higher partial waves and our approach is applicable at all energies .",
    "we solve the resulting cc equations with numerical precision to account for the meson - baryon off - shell interactions .",
    "the dynamical content of our approach is clearly very different from the @xmath8-matrix model of feuster and mosel  @xcite .",
    "our cc approach is defined by the starting lagrangian and by the several approximations such as the sato - lee unitary transformation and a three - dimensional reduction of the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "such approximations have been pursued successfully by numerous authors in order to solve difficult strong interaction problems starting from relativistic field theory .",
    "lagrangian - based dynamics differs considerably from models motivated by the @xmath27- or @xmath8-matrix approach based on tree - diagrams , in which the dynamics is partly defined by postulating crossing symmetry  @xcite .",
    "while s - matrix plus tree - diagram approaches can be a very useful working tool , no solid proof exists that crossing symmetry can be derived `` exactly '' from relativistic quantum field theory .",
    "the best effort is a perturbative derivation in a simple model , such as presented in bjorken and drell .",
    "thus , our approach is not expected to respect crossing symmetry , although the driving terms of the employed coupled - channel scattering equations can be made to have crossing symmetry .",
    "compared with the previous models based on tree - diagrams supplemented by crossing symmetry  @xcite , the coupled - channel approach can satisfy `` dynamically '' the multi - channel unitarity condition .",
    "the cc approach offers the advantage of including strong dynamics for both kaon photoproduction and kaon radiative decays , while also incorporating cusp structure due to channel coupling , which is not described by tree - diagram based theories .",
    "therefore , there are advantages to the cc approach that we believe out - weigh the desire for a crossing symmetric theory .",
    "a coupled - channel framework for studying kaon photoproduction can be obtained straightforwardly by generalizing the dynamical approach developed by sato and lee  @xcite in their investigation of @xmath4 scattering and pion photoproduction . by adding the @xmath22 channel and appropriate @xmath6 states to their formalism",
    ", one can show that the collision matrix , @xmath28 , of the @xmath29 reaction can be written in operator form as @xmath30 here @xmath31 denotes the resonant part ( to be specified later ) , and the nonresonant part @xmath32 is defined by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the meson - baryon propagator for channel @xmath35 here @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the nonresonant photoproduction operators for @xmath22 and @xmath4 respectively .",

    "we now note that if the last two terms in the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ab \" ] ) are neglected , our cc model reduces to those previously developed isobar models for which @xmath52 . in that limit , the resonances",
    "are then included in the @xmath53 term .",
    "the nonresonant meson - baryon @xmath54-matrix defined by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ls1])-([eq : ls2 ] ) is only part of the full meson - baryon scattering @xmath55-matrix .",
    "the @xmath6 excitations must be included . by extending the @xmath4 scattering formulation of ref .",
    "@xcite to include the @xmath22 channel , one can show that the full meson - baryon scattering amplitude can be written as @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",
    "the nonresonant amplitudes @xmath58 are identical to those in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ls1])-([eq : ls2 ] ) .",
    "the resonant term at resonant energy @xmath59 can be written in the familiar breit - wigner form ( after performing a proper diagonalization in the @xmath6 channel space ) @xmath60 with the total width @xmath61 in the above equations , @xmath62 describes the decay of an @xmath6 resonance into a meson - baryon channel @xmath63 .",
    "( 6)-(8 ) will be the starting point for developing a strategy for using the empirical @xmath4 scattering amplitudes to solve eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ls1])-([eq : ls2 ] ) .",
    "one way to approach the coupled - channel equations presented in the previous section is to use effective lagrangians to construct the photoproduction operators @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and meson - baryon potentials @xmath64 .",
    "then one could attempt to solve the full @xmath55-matrix equations consistently as done in ref .",
    "@xcite for pion photoproduction .",
    "this program is too difficult and we therefore make some simplifications in order to first gauge the role of the @xmath4 channels in kaon photoproduction .",
