    "several notions of coherent states have been formulated that capture in great generality many aspects of this intrinsically interdisciplinary territory @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most classical one when dealing with lie group symmetries is that of gilmore - perelomov ( gpcs ) @xcite , that considers the orbits of some given fiducial vector under the action of irreducible unitary representations of the lie group of interest .",
    "the main issue arising when this notion is applied to the euclidean groups @xmath2 is that the irreducible representations are not square integrable , hence no resolution of unity is provided by linear superposition on @xmath3 of projectors , since this would give rise to divergence .",
    "this problem has been addressed in @xcite , with the use of reducible representations constructed as direct integrals over finite intervals of representation parameters , while in @xcite the authors provide square integrable representations on the related homogeneous spaces as an application of a powerful result wich makes use of the geometry of coadjoint orbits for semidirect product groups . moreover , in @xcite it is also pointed out that the construction of reproducing kernel hilbert spaces ( rkhs ) is always possible for gpcs , independently on the square integrability , by restricting to the target of the corresponding coherent state transform .",
    "we addressed the problem from a different perspective .",
    "our approach is strongly motivated by the studies concerning the geometrization of the structure of the primary visual cortex ( v1 ) in mammals @xcite , the first cortical region involved in the processing of visual stimuli captured by the retinal receptors @xcite .",
    "the functional architecture of v1 presents indeed the concurrency of two different symmetries , since the action of single neurons can be modeled as a linear filtering of retinal images with the ( canonical ) coherent states of the second heisenberg group @xmath1 @xcite , while the internal axonal connectivity can be described in terms of the lie algebra of the group of euclidean motions of the plane @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "these two symmetries are tied together by the so - called orientation preference maps ( opm ) , that are mappings from the euclidean plane @xmath4 to the real projective line @xmath5 defining at each point of v1 , represented as a flat surface , the orientation of the gabor filter corresponding to the relative cell @xcite .",
    "these maps contain then informations on how coherent state analysis of two dimensional images is performed by v1 neurons using a two dimensional set of parameters instead of the total four dimensional set , due to the layered structure of v1 , and have proven to be intimately related with the connectivity @xcite .",
    "the purpose of linking these two apparently unrelated symmetries has lead us to the gpcs notion of euclidean coherent states , with fiducial vector chosen as a minimizer of the uncertainty principle for the irreducible representation of @xmath0 .",
    "the corresponding rkhs can be related to the abstract construction explained in @xcite , but its concrete realization contains some extra structure which is relevant for the understanding of this specific problem .",
    "more precisely , the characterization of the space of surjectivity for the coherent state transform is similar to the one of the well known bargmann - fock space : an @xmath6 summability condition , but with respect to a singular measure , and a complex differentiability condition .",
    "this is not trivial , since the dimension of @xmath0 is odd , and hence it can carry only an almost complex structure @xcite : analyticity is then replaced by the weaker cr condition @xcite . then , while complex differentiability is enough to get surjectivity for @xmath1 , in this case the excess of redundancy in the coherent state transform needs also to be controlled by the measure .",
    "moreover , this rkhs coincides with the target space of the canonical bargmann transform when this last is restricted to irreducible hilbert spaces for the representations of @xmath0 .",
    "this result provides then a link between the two symmetries , and also motivates the cr condition , which naturally arises from the corresponding restriction of the ordinary cauchy - riemann equations .",
    "in @xcite we provided a model of the structure of opm @xcite grounded on neurophysiological findings , which is able to reproduce neural activities of v1 measured in the in - vivo experiments and is in agreement with the proposed notion of coherent states .",
    "we would like to emphasize that this concrete application provides not only a motivation for the entire work , but also an example of a biological system whose remarkable organization can be deeply inspiring and demanding .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : coherent ] we first provide precise definitions of the irreducible hilbert spaces for the representations of @xmath0 , following the classical approach introduced in @xcite .",
    "then we define the natural coherent state transform acting on @xmath7 and with theorem [ teo : isosurj ] we characterize its hilbert space of surjectivity @xmath8 . after a comparative discussion on the group structures of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , with theorem [ teo ] and corollary [ cor : diagram ]",
    "we then explicit the functional relations between the two symmetries , showing that the newly defined transform acts as the projection of the classical bargmann transform on @xmath8 .",
    "in section [ sec : model ] we present , as the fundamental application , the model for activated regions of v1 introduced in @xcite : after a description of the functional architecture of v1 and of the experimental setting , we precisely state the model in terms of the introduced coherent states and compare the results with the measurements .",
    "the euclidean motion group @xmath9 is the noncommutative lie group obtained as semidirect product between translation and counterclockwise rotations of the euclidean plane with the usual composition law @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the left invariant vector fields can be calculated as @xcite @xmath11 whose commutator is given by @xmath12 = \\cos\\theta\\partial_{q_1 } + \\sin\\theta\\partial_{q_2}\\ .\\ ] ] since the two vector fields ( [ generators ] ) together with their commutator span the tangent space at any point , by chow theorem @xcite every couple of points can be connected by curves that are piecewise lie group exponential mappings @xmath13 for some @xmath14 , i.e. the group @xmath0 is naturally endowed with a so - called sub - riemannian structure .",
    "the nonintegrable distribution of planes provided by @xmath15 and @xmath16 defines then a contact structure , associated to the contact form @xmath17 and @xmath0 can be seen as the double covering of the manifold of contact elements of the plane @xmath18 .",
    "this last one is not orientable and hence can not carry a global contact form @xcite , but it is useful to note that it arises naturally as the projectivization of the four dimensional phase space @xcite .",
    "if we denote by @xmath19 the n - th heisenberg group @xcite in its semidirect product form @xmath20 , defined by the group law @xmath21 we note that , by an argument analogous to the one expressed for @xmath0 , we can associate to it a contact structure in the darboux normal form @xcite @xmath22 in accordance with the notion of @xmath19 as a central extension of the commutative @xmath23 .",
    "darboux theorem tells then that locally the geometry of @xmath0 is that of @xmath24 , which indeed is its metric tangent cone @xcite .",
    "moreover , as we noted , the contact structure ( [ contactform ] ) is directly inherited by the symplectic structure of the phase space @xmath25 , whose central extension returns the @xmath1 group .",
    "this will be the point that will permit to relate , in subsection [ sec : se2h2 ] , the groups @xmath0 and @xmath1 in terms of the complex structures underlying their coherent states transforms .",
    "we consider the coherent states of @xmath0 obtained with the gilmore - perelomov ( gpcs ) definition @xcite , starting from a minimum of the uncertainty principle . in order to do that ,",
    "we make use of the irreducible representations of @xmath0 @xcite , and of the related algebra representation .    the action of the irreducible unitary representation of @xmath0 with parameter @xmath26 on @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 and for any @xmath29 we obtain a representation that is unitarily equivalent to ( [ s1representation ] ) up to rotations , as @xmath30    the representation of the lie algebra of @xmath0 reads @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the infinitesimal generators corresponding to the left invariant vector fields ( [ generators ] ) .",
    "minimal uncertainty states for @xmath0 in the irreducible representation can be obtained as eigenvectors of the properly constructed annihilation operator @xcite in terms of the operators provided by ( [ eq : operators ] ) .",
    "this specific uncertainty principle has been discussed e.g. in @xcite , and we will be interested only in the eigenvector with eigenvalue zero .",
    "the equation for minimal uncertainty states with zero average angular momentum @xcite reads @xmath34 and is solved by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the @xmath7 normalization .",
    "for @xmath37 we will simply denote them as @xmath38 .",
    "gpcs can then be constructed starting from the fiducial vector @xmath38 .",
    "we consider the family of coherent states for the group @xmath0 @xmath39      this subsection is devoted to the analysis of the coherent state transform defined by the family ( [ eq : se2cs ] ) , which we will call @xmath0-bargmann transform in analogy with the classical bargmann transform ( see also theorem [ teo ] ) .",
    "its hilbert space of surjectivity , denoted @xmath8 is the space of functions on @xmath0 that satisfy an @xmath6 summability condition and a complex differentiability condition , as for the ordinary bargmann space @xcite . following the classical strategy used in @xcite to characterize the irreducible hilbert spaces for the representations of @xmath0 , the summability with respect to the @xmath4 variables",
    "is expressed in terms of a hilbert space @xmath40 which , roughly speaking , consists of functions whose fourier transform is concentrated on a circle , and hence can be treated as functions in @xmath7 .",

    "the works of hubel and wiesel in the 60 s , v1 cells are known to be selective for local orientations of the visual stimuli , i.e. the main direction that characterizes retinal images restricted to the receptive field .",
    "more recently , orientation selectivity has been described in a much deeper detail , the response of v1 simple cells being modeled as a gabor filtering in @xcite , and this assumption has been lately validated experimentally @xcite . given the input @xmath133 as a function on the retina , cell response can then be assumed to be given by @xmath140 as in ( [ eq : csa ] ) .",
    "the variable @xmath116 denotes the center of a cell receptive field and @xmath146 denotes a wave vector whose polar angle @xmath165 characterizes the cell orientation selectivity .",

    "we will also consider , in an additional approximation , that the size of a receptive field , corresponding to the parameter @xmath171 in ( [ eq : csa ] ) , is an intrinsic constant parameter @xcite .",
    "from the point of view of orientation selectivity , v1 can be modeled @xcite as the 3-dimensional fiber bundle @xmath172 , where each point @xmath173 corresponds to a specific cell .",
    "the concrete two dimensional organization corresponds to a section that associates to a cell located at @xmath116 a preferred orientation @xmath165 , and is commonly referred to as opm ( see fig.[pinwheels ] , left ) .",
    "axonal connections in v1 can be broadly classified into two main classes : local connections , among nearby neurons , and long - range connections . in @xcite",
    "it has been proposed a geometric model for long - range connections in the space @xmath174 as an implementation of the geometry of the @xmath0 group , that considers two cells @xmath175 and @xmath176 as connected by curves ( [ expse2 ] ) .",
    "this approach has shown effectiveness in reproducing different tasks , described by the gestalt principle of good continuation .",
    "moreover , the connectivity of v1 provides links between far away cells according to their preferred orientation @xcite , showing then the relation with opm .",
    "several geometric analyses have been proposed concerning the formation of opm in terms of self - organization and in the framework of the physics of defects @xcite .",
    "we must note also that the presence of spontaneous neural activities in the early development of the visual cortex plays a determinant role in the formation of opm .",
    "this is mainly due to the so - called retinal random waves @xcite , that are wavefronts randomly propagating in the retina .",
    "each visual cortex is then subject to a randomness that is characteristic of the specific animal , which is then coded in its realization of opm .",
    "some crucial principles of organizations of these structures were pointed out in @xcite , noting in particular that the fourier spectrum of the orientation maps is approximately concentrated on a circle ( see fig.[pinwheels ] , right ) , or equivalently that these aperiodic structures possess isotropic internal correlations at a fixed characteristic length .",
    "a very recent analysis @xcite quantifies these observations with much sharper instruments , and also include them into a generative model .",
    "in @xcite it was also introduced an empirical method able to reproduce orientation map - like structures as a superposition of complex plane waves with random phases : indeed , if @xmath177 is a white noise with values in @xmath178 $ ] and indexed by @xmath179 , then the structures in fig.[pinwheels ] can be approximately reproduced as @xmath180 where the integral should properly be intended in it sense .        the experiments that allow to obtain opm as in fig.[pinwheels ] , left @xcite rely on optical imaging techniques that quantify blood charge in the neural tissue using fmri .",
    "this setting is then used to measure the activity in v1 caused by cells responses to so - called gratings .",
    "gratings are images constituted by straight parallel black and white stripes shifting along the perpendicular direction , that can be easily provided by plane waves with phase shift",
    ". experiments with gratings have shown that activated regions depend only on the angle at which they are presented , or better the orientation , since the stimulus , and consequently the resulting activity , can not be distinguished at angles of @xmath181 due to the phase shift .",
    "an example of the images obtained is given in fig.[blobcomparison ] , left .",
    "the result of this experiment is then a family of real maps @xmath182 , that can be used to obtain the opm coded with colors as in fig.[pinwheels ] by performing a vector sum and then considering the resulting orientation @xcite ( see fig.[blobcomparison ] , right ) : @xmath183    we note that , starting from a given an orientation map @xmath184 , a way to obtain activated regions that are compatible with ( [ eq : colorcoding ] ) is by scalar product , i.e. @xmath185",
    "so in particular if we consider the construction ( [ eq : randomphases ] ) , then ( [ eq : scalarprcol ] ) reduces to @xmath186 we are going to see that model introduced in @xcite does indeed reproduce activities in the form ( [ eq : blobsempirical ] ) , and hence opm in the form ( [ eq : randomphases ] ) , but starting from a geometric model of the activities , so that opm arise as a consequence of the color coding ( [ eq : colorcoding ] ) .",
    "the model we have proposed in @xcite in order to reproduce the activity patterns resulting from the gratings experiment can be stated in terms of an @xmath0-bargmann transform of a specific white noise process .",
