    "measurements were carried out in the star experiment .",
    "the charged particles were measured in the central time projection chamber@xcite ( tpc ) within @xmath3@xmath4@xmath3 @xmath5 1.2 and in the forward tpcs within 2.5 @xmath5 @xmath3@xmath4@xmath3 @xmath5 4.0 .",
    "the au - au data set @xcite and the p - p data set are separated into centrality / multiplicity classes based on the charged particle multiplicity within @xmath3@xmath4@xmath3 @xmath5 0.5 . for d - au collisions the three centrality classes are based on the charged particle multiplicity within -3.8 @xmath5@xmath4 @xmath5 -2.8 . the charged particles : @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , were identified in the tpc by their ionization energy loss .    0.8    the measured momentum was corrected for energy loss .",
    "particle spectra were corrected for acceptance and tracking inefficiency .",
    "pions were corrected for weak decays . in p - p and in peripheral d - au the spectra were corrected for vertex finding inefficiency and fake vertices . more analysis details can be found in @xcite .",
    "0.50    0.8    fig .",
    "1 shows the transverse mass spectra measured in -0.3 @xmath5 y @xmath5 0.3 . in triangles",
    "nine centrality bins are shown for au - au collisions ( from top to the bottom , central to peripheral ) . in circles",
    "the three centrality bin of d - au are shown and scaled down by a factor of 2 . in stars the p - p data are shown for the four multiplicity bins , scaled down by a factor of 4 . for heavier particles",
    "the spectra harden with increasing multiplicity / centrality . in heavy ion collisions",
    "this hardening can be understood as an increasing radial flow from peripheral to central collisions .",
    "on the other hand the highest multiplicity p - p and the most central d - au spectra are harder than the peripheral au - au spectra but not as hard as the central au - au as shown in fig .",
    "2 . in p - p and",
    "d - au collisions radial flow is presumably not present .",
    "one would like to investigate these systems in a common model framework .",
    "we use the blast wave model@xcite , which assumes a boosted thermal source in the transverse direction .",
    "there are three parameters in the model : the kinetic freeze out temperature @xmath11 , the transverse flow velocity @xmath12 and the @xmath13 parameter that is the exponent of the flow profile : @xmath12=@xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the surface velocity .",
    "the model can describe simultaneously the @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 spectra and the @xmath16 @xmath17 0.5 gev / c region of the @xmath6 , @xmath7 spectra .",
    "the low momentum pions were excluded from the fit as they are significantly contaminated by resonance decays .    1.0    fig .",
    "3 shows the obtained @xmath12 and @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath13 parameters ranges between : 2.0 - 0.7 and 1.6 - 1.2 in p - p and d - au .",
    "there seems to be a smooth decrease in @xmath11 from p - p , to d - au to au - au collisions .",
    "the flow velocity increases with increasing charged multiplicity .",
    "the trend in p - p and d - au seem to be different from au - au however the physical meaning of @xmath18 may be different .",
    "for example in p - p and d - au the increase could due to initial @xmath19 broadening , multiple soft interactions and increasing jet contribution .    similar trend is observed for the average transverse momenta of antiprotons , negative kaons , which is shown in fig .",
    "the pion @xmath20 is extracted from bose einstein fit and @xmath21 of kaons and antiprotons are extracted from the blast wave fit .",
    "pion @xmath21 shows almost no dependence on charged multiplicity or collision system while the heavier particles @xmath21 exhibit an increase with increasing charged multiplicity .",
    "1.0    in fig .",
    "4 ( right panel ) particle ratios of the integrated yields in @xmath3y@xmath3 @xmath5 0.3 are shown : @xmath9/@xmath22 and @xmath10/@xmath22 .",
    "the ratios show a moderate change with increasing charged multiplicity .",
    "our measurements are consistent with e735 at tevatron@xcite where the multiplicity dependence of the particle ratios were also studied .",
    "the @xmath9/@xmath22 ratio in p - p , even at very high multiplicity as measured by e735@xcite appears to be smaller than central au - au value .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite , that the @xmath9/@xmath22 in heavy ion and minimum bias p - p collisions follow a systematic trend in the bjorken estimate of initial energy density .",
    "furthermore scavenius et al .",
    "@xcite argue that a larger @xmath23/@xmath22 ratio in au - au than in high - multiplcity p - p at similar energy density may indicate an onset of a deconfined phase .",
    "in summary , identified @xmath22 , k , and @xmath10 spectra are measured in mid - rapidity and studied as a function of event multiplicity .",
    "hardening of the particle spectra with increasing multiplicity / centrality was observed for p - p and d - au .",
    "the data are studied within the blast wave model .",
    "the extracted kinetic freeze out temperature smoothly decreases with increasing charged multiplicity , while the extracted @xmath18 increases .",
    "the particle ratios do not show significant change .",
