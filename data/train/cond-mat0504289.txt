    ", the approach can be used to calculate the particle spectrum in the system with the different particle concentrations at various temperatures , and it gives nontrivial results for the spectrum of localized particles in the falicov - kimball model .    the self - consistency condition connecting mutually the single - site green s function and the coherent potential gives the simple result ( [ j_to_g_at_mott ] ) when the metal - insulator transition occurs at half - filling on the lattice with a symmetric noninteracting density of states . as a result",
