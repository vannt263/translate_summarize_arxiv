    "typically , a cell type of interest is labeled with an identifier and the distribution of its progeny at later time points are observed .",
    "clone distribution data can then be used to decipher division dynamics across the population of cells with great resolution .",

    "as above , a dividing cell ( p ) may divide to two dividing daughters ( pp ) , a dividing and differentiated daughter ( pd ) , or two differentiated daughters ( dd ) in proportions @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively . in tissues with high turnover , the number of new dividing cells is equal to the number of non - dividing cells ( @xmath3 ) .",

    "this gives a survival advantage to mutant clones .",
    "( d ) mutant cell formation itself is a birth process that can follow one of three possibilities .",
    "the first is cell division independent and can occur with background exposure .",
    "the second and third possibilities occur following cell division , producing one or two mutant cells out of two daughter cells with probability @xmath5.,width=566 ]    adult mammalian epithelium has a high rate of cell division during steady state . despite this rapid rate of proliferation ,",
    "the tissue remains in homeostasis as new cells are being generated at the same rate as loss of differentiated cells in a birth - death process ( @xmath3 in figure [ mutationdivision]b ) .",
    "a simple illustration of this is in the inter - follicular epidermis , where cell division occurs in the basal layer of a multi - layered epithelium .",
    "cell division here can produce proliferating daughters , that remain in the basal layer , or non - dividing daughters , which are shed to the supra - basal layers , and eventually lost in a process of differentiation .",
    "when these keratinocytes are grown in culture , a typical cell division can result in two dividing daughters , one dividing daughter or no dividing daughter out of two total daughters as seen through the uptake of the proliferation marker 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine ( edu , figure [ mutationdivision]a ) .",
    "genetic lineage tracing in basal keratinocytes has allowed conditional expression of fluorescent proteins , with all subsequent daughter cells retaining the label , and thus being highlighted as a clone .",
    "clone size distributions thus observed shows maintenance through a population asymmetry of fate outcome in dividing progenitors , with reserve stem cells contributing to wound healing @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "additionally , this balance is disturbed in chronic uv irradiation , where p53 mutant keratinocyte clones gain a survival advantage over non - mutant clones mediated through increased proportions of proliferative daughters @xcite ( @xmath6 in figure [ mutationdivision]c )",
    ". the recent technical advance of live - imaging in epithelia may provide additional information to these models , such as the distribution of cell cycle times @xcite .",
    "there is also an increasing body of work investigating the growth dynamics of pre - neoplastic and neoplastic tissue @xcite@xcite .",
    "a growing colony of cells can be modeled as a branching process .",
    "luria and delbrck were the first to produce an analytical examination of the distribution of the number of mutant cells in growing bacterial colonies @xcite .",
    "they used this to show that mutations arise randomly rather than in response to the environment .",
    "their argument was partly deterministic and lea and coulson @xcite and bartlett @xcite , @xcite derived approaches with greater stochastic rigour .",
    "these methods generally consider the problem of how many mutants are present after a fixed amount of time .",
    "an unpublished combinatorial method by haldane also exists @xcite where all cells divide simultaneously .",
    "these distributions generally assign genes the binary status of mutated or non - mutated .",
    "they do not consider the number of mutations in a gene , or the number of different combinations of mutations a subclone of cells may contain .",
    "modern sequencing techniques mean greater resolution of mutations is now possible and there is increased interest in considering distributions associated with combinations of mutations @xcite .",
    "as kendall observed @xcite , @xcite there are broadly three models for mutation formulation ( figure [ mutationdivision]d ) .",
    "the first formulation would indicate a single cell converts to mutated status at any time independent of the cell division process",
    ". this may be the case for continuous exposure to mutagens , such as uv light @xcite .",
    "the second formulation is the most common formulation where mutations occur in one of the two daughter cells during the cell division process .",
    "this is likely to be the case for many mutational processes , where nucleotide errors occur on one of the two dna strands @xcite .",
    "dna repair machinery then erroneously corrects this during checkpoints in the cell cycle , resulting in one mutant daughter cell .",
    "the third formulation assumes that both daughter cells are mutant .",
    "this is also a valid model , and is likely to arise when double stranded breaks occur .",
    "when double stranded repair incorrectly repairs the damage , rearrangements result and both daughter cells will be mutant . some processes such as breakage - fusion - bridge cycles will even result in two mutant daughter cells with distinct rearrangements @xcite , @xcite . for analytical purposes in this paper",
    ", we will assume the most common second formulation .",
    "additionally , we assume that a mutation does not increase the chance of cell loss through apoptosis .",
    "in this work , we consider a different statistical approach to clonal distributions .",
    "a standard technique to analyzing a branching process involving two classes of objects , such as mutant / non - mutant , or progenitor / differentiated , is to write down a chapman - kolomogorov equation for @xmath7 ; the probability of having @xmath8 and @xmath9 cells of the two types , at time @xmath10 , and obtain a solution @xcite .",
    "instead , we determine the distribution of the number of different types of cells that are present when a fixed number of cells have accumulated , rather than the time that has passed . with this approach",
    ", we will see that treating cell differentiation or mutation as time - independent results in exact analytic forms for the distributions of interest . in the next section",
    "we obtain the distribution for the number of dividing cells in an epithelial population .",
    "we then obtain distributions for the number of mutant cells in a clone undergoing a pure birth process .",
    "tissue homeostasis is balanced by two types of cells ; progenitor ( dividing ) cells ( @xmath11 ) , and differentiated ( non - dividing ) cells ( @xmath12 ) . as progenitor cells ( p ) divide , they produce two daughter cells which may be either a progenitor cell or a differentiated cell ( d ) resulting in the combinations ( pp ) , ( pd ) or ( dd ) .",
    "we assume the probabilities of these occurring are @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , respectively represented in figure [ mutationdivision]b . across a population",
    ", these probabilities are assumed to be constant , holding the same values for any cell division that takes place at steady state .",
    "there is the possibility that apoptosis may form an additional component of this process .",
    "whilst one could incorporate this as an additional branch in the process of figure [ mutationdivision]a , it is assumed negligible in the following analysis .    for simplicity , we assume that we start with a single dividing cell .",
    "we also assume the number of descendant cells can be observed , but that ( p ) and ( d ) cells can not be distinguished .",
    "there are two problems we would like to consider .",
    "firstly , if we trace the lineage of a single cell , we wish to determine the distribution of the number of progenitor ( p ) cells present .",
    "secondly , the physical similarity between ( p ) and ( d ) cells without any protein markers make the parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 difficult to directly measure .",
    "thus , we would like a method to estimate them .",
    "r0.5     now , our approach is based on the size of the clone ( rather than time passed ) .",
    "now , with each cell division , irrespective of outcome , the colony size @xmath9 increases by @xmath13 forming a clone of @xmath14 cells .",
    "if the cell division results in two progenitor daughters ( pp ) , the number of dividing cells @xmath15 increases to @xmath16 .",
    "if the cell division results in a progenitor cell and a differentiated cell ( pd ) , the number of dividing cells @xmath15 stays the same .",
    "the production of two differentiated daughters ( dd ) results in a loss of dividing cells to @xmath17 .",
    "we can thus model the number of p cells as a discrete random walk that can move up , remain flat , or move down with probabilities @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where we have one forward step to take at every cell division as in figure [ mutationdivisionb]a , b . note that if the colony becomes fully differentiated , @xmath18 , we have no dividing cells and our process stops .",
    "we note that the timing of these divisions does not relate to the count of proliferating cells . in figure",
    "[ mutationdivisionb]a we see the time dependent process , with a division rate that will be proportional to the number of proliferating cells . in figure",
    "[ mutationdivisionb]b we see the same information indexed by the number of cell divisions ; the timing is not important .",
    "such a problem is closely related to counting motzkin lattice paths @xcite .",
    "lattice paths are paths connecting positions with integer coordinates and can take a variety of forms @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in particular , motzkin paths start from the origin @xmath19 on a 2-d integer lattice and allow movement with an _ up _ @xmath20 step , a _ flat",
    "_ @xmath21 step , or a _ down _ @xmath22 step such that we never move below the horizontal axis .",
    "there are several path counting techniques for such conditions @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , which have also seen applications to paths similar to the ones we describe @xcite @xcite .",
    "these have been studied for a range of combinatorial problems @xcite , including some problems with weighted edges @xcite .",
    "these paths can be utilised to represent our problem .",
    "the position @xmath23 corresponds to the total number of cells , @xmath9 , and the number of dividing cells , @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the pp , pd or dd divisions correspond to the up , flat and down steps , respectively .",
    "there are three differences to motzkin paths to note .",
    "firstly , we start with one ( p ) cell , represented by position @xmath20 .",
    "secondly , we stop if we touch the horizontal axis , because no dividing ( p ) cells remain ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "lastly , we have probabilities @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 associated with each step .",
    "now , we would like to find the probability @xmath24 of finding @xmath15 dividing cells in a clone of size @xmath9 .",
    "this probability then corresponds to a weighted sum of motzkin paths from @xmath20 to @xmath23 , where motzkin paths in this context do not touch the horizontal axis .     and",
    "proliferating cells within it @xmath15 occurs along fixed paths of a motzkin like triangle .",
    "clones that reach the horizontal axis have only non - dividing cells , and therefore do not progress further .",
    "( b ) example showing the @xmath25 paths that a single proliferating cell can take to reach a clone of @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the first three routes have three @xmath0 divisions and one @xmath2 division , while the remaining six routes involve two each of @xmath0 and @xmath1 divisions ( cumulative probability @xmath28 ) .",
    "( c ) is a dyck path , which moves up and down and not below the horizontal axis .",
    "( d ) is a motzkin path , which also includes horizontal moves .",
    "( e ) is a gamblers ruin problem , which starts from height @xmath13 rather than the origin , representing the formation of a fully differentiated clone from a single dividing cell.,width=510,height=377 ]      we have the following distribution for the number of progenitor ( p ) cells in a colony .",
    "if we seed a single dividing cell , then the probability of having @xmath29 dividing cells when the colony is of size @xmath9 is given by :    @xmath30    we start with dyck paths ; paths from @xmath19 to @xmath31 that do not go below the horizontal axis involving steps of type up , @xmath20 or down , @xmath22 , such as portrayed in figure [ lattice]c .",
    "the number of such paths is known to be counted by the catalan numbers @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "a dyck triangle is the collection of paths from @xmath19 to @xmath23 that do not go below the horizontal axis and involve up and down steps .",
    "note that @xmath9 and @xmath15 must have the same parity .",
    "if @xmath33 count these paths then conditioning over one step we find @xmath34 .",
    "it is straightforward to show by substitution that @xmath35 satisfies this recurrence , along with boundary condition @xmath36 .",
    "this formula differs to other counts involving dyck triangles because this lattice formulation of the triangle is rotated through @xmath37 to the usual presentation @xcite .",
    "we now turn to motzkin paths , which are the same as dyck paths except we now allow an additional horizontal step @xmath21 .",
    "now any motzkin path from @xmath19 to @xmath23 can be partitioned into a dyck path from @xmath19 to @xmath38 involving @xmath39 up steps and @xmath40 down steps , along with @xmath41 horizontal steps , where @xmath42 . for any @xmath40 ,",
    "the probability of such a path arising is @xmath43 . then noting that we have @xmath44 permutations of the horizontal steps with the dyck path steps , we sum across the possibilities to get the following probability .",
    "@xmath45    finally we note that we are going from position @xmath20 to @xmath23 without touching the horizontal axis , so substituting @xmath46 and @xmath47 gives the required result ; @xmath48 .",
    "this result allows us to look at the case where all @xmath9 cells in the colony are fully differentiated ( all are ( d ) cells ) and there is not further potential for growth . in our motzkin triangle analogy",
    ", this would be a motzkin path ( with an additional final down step ) from @xmath20 to @xmath49 , such as the path in figure [ lattice]e .",
    "all colonies that have a corresponding path touching the horizontal axis thus have no proliferating cells .",
    "we have an absorbing barrier , also known as the gambler s ruin problem .",
    "[ ruin ] the probability @xmath50 is given by weighted motzkin numbers :    @xmath51    for the case where there are no dividing cells remaining in the colony , the colony must transit through a penultimate stage @xmath52 with only one dividing cell remaining , and undergo an enforced final ( dd ) division . multiplying the formula for @xmath53 by @xmath2 gives the required result .",
    "both of these results have corresponding generating functions as described in the following result :    [ genfunc ] the generating function @xmath54 is given by :    @xmath55    first we construct a weighted generating function for paths in a standard motzkin triangle , @xmath56 , where @xmath57 are the motzkin numbers weighted by the elements @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 associated with each path from @xmath19 to @xmath23 .",
    "now conditioning over a single step gives the following recurrence ; @xmath58 . then substituting this into the generating function yields the following :    @xmath59    which gives us :    @xmath60 .    to find @xmath61 we note that a motzkin path from @xmath19 to @xmath49 involves either a first horizontal step and a weighted motzkin path one step smaller , or an up step , a motzkin path , a down step , and a motzkin path",
    "this is summarised as @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the weighted sum of these paths . now substituting this recurrence into the generating function @xmath64 yields @xmath65 .",
    "the solution satisfying @xmath66 is then :    @xmath67    substituting this above then yields the general form :    @xmath68    the result is obtained by noting that the generating function for @xmath24 corresponds to paths from @xmath20 to @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , a path from @xmath20 to @xmath49 involves a weighted motzkin path of length @xmath69 , followed by a down step , and we find that :    @xmath70 .    substituting the weighted motzkin generating functions results in the desired form .",
    "we are now in a position to describe the probability of ruin , or equivalently the probability of a fully differentiated clone , where we have the following result :    [ ruingf ] the generating function @xmath71 is given by :    @xmath72    this results in an alternative expression for the probability @xmath50 that a clone of size @xmath9 is fully differentiated :    @xmath73    furthermore , we find that the probability @xmath74 that a single proliferating cell will become fully differentiated is given by :    @xmath75    to get the generating function @xmath76 , we simply substitute @xmath77 into @xmath78 from theorem [ genfunc ] . to get the alternative expression for the probabilities @xmath50 note that we can write @xmath76 as :    @xmath79 $ ]    a double binomial expansion gives us :    @xmath80 $ ]",
    "the constant and linear terms cancel and a reordering of the summation to collect powers of @xmath10 leaves us with the required expression .",
    "lastly we note that @xmath81 and so substituting @xmath82 into the generating function gives us :    @xmath83    where we have used @xmath84 .",
    "separately considering the cases @xmath6 and @xmath85 gives the required results .",

    "colonies arising from such populations will eventually become fully differentiated and stop growing , as represented in the bottom row of figure [ lattice]a .",
    "therefore , at late time points of observation all colonies of cells with few cell numbers will be formed exclusively of non - dividing cells , as any colonies with dividing cells will continue to expand in cell number .",
    "thus repeated measurements of small clone sizes , @xmath86 , of fully differentiated non - dividing colonies of size @xmath9 can readily be counted .",
    "we can then compare these counts to the probabilities @xmath87 of either corollary [ ruingf ] or [ ruin ] , and hence determine @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 using maximum likelihood .",
    "small clone sizes form the bulk of clones seen in population distributions , and therefore can provide robust quantifiable results .",
    "it is also important to highlight , that this is not affected by the presence of additional cell populations which have a branching birth process alone ( putative stem cell populations ) .",
    "the clones formed by such populations will be much larger , continuing to expand with time , so can be readily identified and excluded .",
    "finally , we remark that a lot of the derivations using motzkin paths can also be replaced with approaches from stochastic processes .",
    "we highlight this with an alternative derivation of the gambler s ruin generating function of corollary [ ruingf ] in the appendix .",

    "the cells are dividing randomly at a rate @xmath89 according to the following markovian branching ( yule - furry ) process .",

    "conversely , we may obtain two non - mutants with probability @xmath92 , such as in the second division portayed at time @xmath93 . finally , any dividing mutant produces two mutant daughters with probability 1 , as displayed at times @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "we ignore any back mutation or loss of mutation .",
    "as the colony grows , the rate of division , @xmath96 , increases in proportion to the number of cells present , @xmath15 . if @xmath97 is the time of the @xmath98 division , the mean time intervals @xmath99 correspondingly decrease as we get exponential growth .",
    "note that at time @xmath97 the colony increases in size ( by one cell ) to @xmath16 cells .",
    "it is this single dividing cell that has the opportunity to effect the number of mutations at this point ; this is independent of the either the time @xmath97 at which this takes place , or the time @xmath99 between divisions .    in figure",
    "[ mutationdivisionc]b we see the mutation process as a discrete process on the number of divisions that have taken place .",

    "this is a symbolic representation of the mutation and sequencing depth information obtained from modern experiments and points to other avenues of investigation .",
    "firstly we would like to know the number of cells containing a randomly selected mutation .",
    "secondly , we would like to know the number of clones .",
    "thirdly , we would like to know the number of cells .",
    "finally , we would like to know the number of distinct mutations in a randomly selected clone .",
    "we have the following results .    ) , which cluster into four clones .",
    "( b ) represents the cellular count for each mutation against illustrative chromosomal co - ordinates.,width=529,height=170 ]      if @xmath157 is the probability that a randomly selected mutation exists in @xmath158 cells in a colony of @xmath15 cells , we have :    @xmath159    this differs slightly to the original problem considered by luria and delbrck in that instead of asking how many cells contain a mutation in a specific gene ( or region ) , which may involve many different mutation events , we randomly sample a mutation from all mutations found in that region , and count the corresponding number of cells containing that mutation .",
    "we assume each mutation arises only once , which may not be true for large colonies or small genomes .",
    "now there are @xmath17 divisions that take place to give a sample size of @xmath15 . now if we randomly select a mutation it can arise during any of these divisions with equal probability .",
    "we let @xmath160 denote the probability that if a mutation forms when there are @xmath118 cells , it is present in @xmath158 cells when the cell population is @xmath161 .",
    "then if @xmath157 is the probability a randomly selected mutation is in @xmath158 cells when the population is of size @xmath15 , we have :    @xmath162    if the mutation arises when the population has size @xmath118 , then this mutation may be present in any of @xmath13 to @xmath163 cells , depending on whether the cells containing the mutation divide .",
    "thus @xmath164 . furthermore , following a population size of @xmath17 , we either had @xmath165 copies of the mutation and the next cell division duplicates a copy , or we have @xmath158 mutant cells , and the dividing cell does not contain the mutation of interest .",
    "this gives us the recurrence :    @xmath166    now if we start with the initial value @xmath167 , so that initially one of @xmath118 cells carries the mutation , then we can show by substitution that this recurrence and initial condition is satisfied by the following expression :    @xmath168    where @xmath169 is the pochhammer symbol . substituting into the expression above then gives :    @xmath170    this is equivalent to the expression in the theorem .",
    "the second problem requires the distribution of the number of clones .",
    "every time a new mutation occurs , it will occur in a single cell that belongs to some clone already present .",
    "that cell will divide into two daughters , one of which will contain the new mutation . that cell will have a new combination of mutations and a new clone is born .",
    "we thus trivially observe that the number of clones is always one more than the number of cells divisions that produce new mutations .",
    "now , mutations can arise during a cell division . for a colony of size",
    "@xmath15 we have @xmath17 independent cell divisions in total , each of which may generate new mutations with probability @xmath90 .",
    "we thus find that :    if @xmath171 represents the number of colonies , we find that for a colony of size @xmath15 , @xmath172 has binomial distribution @xmath173 .",
    "@xmath174      the third question concerns the size of the clones .",
    "for example , in figure [ depth]a we note that clone @xmath175 was formed in the @xmath176 cell division , and contains a single cell .",
    "the associated distribution for the size of a random clone is described in the following result .",
    "if @xmath177 represents the probability a randomly selected clone from a population of size @xmath15 contains @xmath9 cells , and @xmath178 is the corresponding probability for a clone formed in the @xmath121 cell division , then @xmath179 where :    @xmath180 where @xmath181 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath178 satisfies the following recurrence :    @xmath182    with boundary values    @xmath183    a new clone arises whenever a mutation occurs . for a colony of size @xmath15 ,",
    "a randomly selected mutation arises with equal probability @xmath184 at any of the @xmath17 divisions that have taken place .",
    "let us suppose the colony appears at division @xmath40 .",
    "the clone contains a single cell at this moment in time and there are @xmath185 divisions remaining to take place .",
    "if any of these divisions occurs in a cell not in the clone , the clone will not change in size .",
    "if the division occurs in a clone cell with mutation , the clone also does not change size because one of the two daughter cells starts a new distinct clone .",
    "however , if the division occurs in a clone cell without mutation , the clone increases in size by @xmath13 .",
    "if the clone is of size @xmath186 and we have @xmath187 cells , this occurs with probability @xmath188 . then if @xmath189 represents the probability that a clone starting at division @xmath40 ends up of size @xmath9 we require @xmath149 of the remaining @xmath185 divisions to be divisions within the clone without mutation .",
    "then if @xmath190 denote the corresponding divisions , analogously to the derivation of theorem [ mainresult ] , we require the sum :    @xmath191    next note that a clone is equally likely to occur at any of @xmath17 cell divisions , so @xmath192 .",
    "finally we note that we must have @xmath193 to provide enough cell divisions to reach size @xmath9 , otherwise @xmath178 is zero and so we obtain the required form .    for the recurrence we use a telescoping technique .",
    "first we note that we can split the sum up to give the following ( where @xmath181 , @xmath194 and @xmath195 ) ,    @xmath196    from this we subtract the corresponding equation for @xmath197 which results in the term @xmath198 .",
    "we then have the stated recursion .    for the initial value note that for a clone formed in the @xmath121 cell division to remain one cell in size , we must ensure that for each subsequent cell division , the single cell either does not divide ( the clone remains the same ) , or divides with mutation ( so one of the daughter cells forms a new clone ) .",
    "this is @xmath199 for the @xmath200 division , which results in the initial condition specified in the theorem .      finally , we need the number of mutations in a randomly selected clone . for example , note that clone @xmath175 from figure [ depth]a is composed of three mutations , two of which formed during the @xmath176 cell division . in general we have the following result .",
    "let @xmath201 be the bernoulli variable with success probability @xmath202 for @xmath203 .",
    "a clone arises at cell division @xmath40 with probability @xmath184 , where @xmath15 is the total population size .",
    "the number of mutations accumulated by a clone formed in cell division @xmath40 is @xmath204 , where @xmath205 .",
    "new mutations occur during any cell division with a probability @xmath5 . now",
    "if we assume that different mutations arise independently , we can assume they are poisson distributed per cell division with some parameter @xmath206 so that @xmath207 .",
    "now if a clone occurs at division @xmath40 , any subsequent mutations form new clones and do not belong to this clone . however",
    ", any earlier mutations may have been incorporated into its lineage .",
    "the first cell division occurs in this lineage with probability @xmath13 , the second division with probability @xmath208 , the @xmath133 with probability @xmath209 .",
    "the total number of mutations in the lineage is then a sum of identical poisson variables over cell divisions in this lineage .",
    "we have shown that the number of mutated or proliferating cells in a clone has a natural dependency upon the total clone size , rather than time taken for a single cell to grow into the observed clone , resulting in combinatorial and generating function approaches to analyze their distributions .",
    "the approaches above are applicable to any markovian branching process where daughter branches in the process have distinct characteristics . in the examples we have discussed ,",
    "the branches represented the differentiation status , or the mutation status of daughter nodes .",
    "however , the branches can be more generally coloured as we like and the distributions of the number of descending nodes examined with these techniques .",
    "these approaches are exact but can be difficult to handle for large samples sizes and some asymptotics would be useful .",
    "furthermore , the results all assume that the processes of cell division are markovian and so the cell cycle exponentially distributed .",
    "this is unlikely to be accurate , with cell cycle generally being better approximated by gamma distributions .",
    "this may have significant effect on some results and warrants further exploration .",
    "we acknowledge support from the cambridge cancer centre research fellowship ( ar ) , and the medical research council ( phj ) .",
    "alternative proof of corollary [ ruingf ] using stochastic processes methods .",
    "we let @xmath211 denote the probability of being at height @xmath210 after @xmath9 steps , where the walk is initially unrestricted and may move below or above height @xmath210 .",
    "this requires @xmath186 up steps and @xmath212 down steps for some @xmath213 and so we obtain the multinomial sum for @xmath214 :            similarly , we let @xmath218 denote the probabililty of being at height @xmath210 after @xmath9 steps , this time starting from height @xmath210 . again",
    ", we do not prohibit negative heights .",
    "this requires @xmath186 up steps and @xmath186 down steps for some @xmath219 and so we obtain the multinomial sum for @xmath214 :          we are interested in the first visit to height @xmath210 starting from height @xmath13 .",
    "now , if we know we are at height @xmath210 after @xmath9 steps , then there must be a first visit to height zero after @xmath158 steps for some @xmath158 with @xmath222 .",
    "if @xmath223 represents the probability of a first visit to @xmath210 after @xmath158 steps we then have the discrete convolution :              to obtain the required expression in corollary [ ruingf ] , we note that the generating function @xmath71 relates to the probability of ruin @xmath50 when there are @xmath9 cells present .",
    "we start from @xmath13 cell , so this involves @xmath149 steps and we find @xmath229 . in terms of generating functions , we find @xmath230 , which gives the desired form for @xmath76 ."
