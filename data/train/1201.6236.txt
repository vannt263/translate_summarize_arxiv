    "this result , which we formally state as proposition  [ main2 ] below , is achieved by taking suitable tensor products of pairs of matrices whose extremal sequences are known to have at least linear subword complexity .",
    "secondly , in proposition  [ squidge ] below we prove that for any set @xmath86 of @xmath103-dimensional matrices , one may construct a pair @xmath104 of square matrices of dimension @xmath105 such that the subword complexity of the extremal sequences of @xmath97 is asymptotically related to that of the extremal sequences of @xmath5 in a precise manner . this construction is based on the proof of a theorem of r. jungers and v. blondel which states that a finite set of matrices possesses a periodic extremal sequence if and only if an associated _ pair _ of matrices has the same property @xcite . since",
    "jungers and blondel s work only considers periodic extremal sequences , whilst we consider general extremal sequences , our analysis uses the same definitions but is significantly more technical in the manner in which these definitions are employed . the reader may verify that theorem  [ major ] follows from the combination of propositions  [ main2 ] and [ squidge ] in a straightforward manner .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ major ] is constructive , and we therefore provide an example of the pair of matrices arising in the case @xmath106 in section  [ sec : ex ] below .",
