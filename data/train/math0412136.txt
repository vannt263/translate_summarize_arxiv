    "* problem 8) .",

    ", @xmath16 admits a _",
    "complete _ hyperbolic structure @xcite . by mostow rigidity , this hyperbolic structure is in fact unique .",
    "if @xmath16 is orientable , then after choosing an orientation , the hyperbolic structure determines a discrete , faithful representation @xmath17 it turns out that @xmath18 always lifts to a representation into @xmath0 ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and henceforth we will regard @xmath0 as the target of @xmath18 .      now @xmath19 is an hnn extension @xmath20 since @xmath13 is an open surface of finite type , its fundamental group @xmath21 is a finitely generated free group .",
    "take @xmath22 which is a free subgroup of @xmath0 .",
    "note that for any @xmath23 , the element @xmath24 conjugates @xmath1 to itself .    we now restrict attention to @xmath16 with a very special property ;",
    "we will give an example of such an @xmath16 in section  [ sec : example ] .",
    "[ requirement ] there is a @xmath25 such that @xmath24 has trace @xmath26 for some integer @xmath27 .",
    "equivalently , we want @xmath24 to have eigenvalues @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the image of @xmath24 in @xmath0 is a hyperbolic isometry of @xmath30 , and has has two fixed points in @xmath31 .",
    "after conjugating @xmath18 , we can assume these fixed points are @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and @xmath24 acts on @xmath34 by @xmath35 .",
    "for @xmath36 , let @xmath37 denote the parabolic element of @xmath0 which acts on @xmath34 by @xmath38 .",
    "note that @xmath24 conjugates @xmath37 to @xmath39    for each @xmath40 , define @xmath41",
    ". then @xmath42 is finitely generated , and @xmath24 conjugates it to a proper subgroup of itself .",
    "the following lemma , proved in the next section , shows that @xmath42 is free for generic values of @xmath40 .",
    "[ lemma ] let @xmath1 be a finitely generated subgroup of @xmath0 .",
    "consider the group @xmath43 for some @xmath36 .",
    "suppose that no non - trivial element of @xmath1 fixes @xmath44 .",
    "then for generic @xmath40 , the group @xmath42 is isomorphic to the free product @xmath45 .    for the action of the fundamental group of a finite volume hyperbolic manifold on @xmath34 , the stabilizer of any point is either empty , an infinite cyclic group consisting of hyperbolic elements , or @xmath46 consisting of parabolic elements .",
    "now @xmath24 is not parabolic as its trace is not @xmath47 .",
    "thus the stabilizer of @xmath33 in @xmath19 is infinite cyclic .",
    "so if some @xmath48 also fixed @xmath33 , then @xmath49 for suitable non - trivial powers @xmath11 and @xmath50 .",
    "since no power of @xmath51 lies in @xmath21 , the element @xmath24 has no fixed point in common with any element of @xmath1 .",
    "thus the lemma applies in our context and @xmath42 is free for most choices of @xmath40 .",
    "thus , given a hyperbolic 3-manifold satisfying the requirement , we get a free group @xmath42 which is conjugate to a proper subgroup of itself by @xmath24",
    ". then the subgroup @xmath52 of @xmath0 is isomorphic to the ascending hnn extension of @xmath42 by the map induced via conjugation by @xmath24 .",
    "this completes our construction and proves theorem  [ main - thm ] modulo two things : proving the lemma , and exhibiting an @xmath16 satisfying requirement  [ requirement ] where @xmath21 has rank 5 .",
    "these remaining tasks are carried out in the next two sections .",
    "the reader may wonder how plausible it is to expect a manifold satisfying requirement  [ requirement ] .",
    "for any finite volume hyperbolic -manifold , the geometric representation @xmath53 can be conjugated so that its image lies in @xmath54 for some finite extension @xmath55 of @xmath56 .",
    "this is because if one looks at representations @xmath57 where the cusp group acts by parabolics , then the representation @xmath18 coming from the hyperbolic structure is an isolated point if we mod out by conjugation @xcite .",
    "the set of conjugacy classes of such representations is an algebraic variety defined over @xmath56 , and hence isolated points have coordinates in a number field .",
    "thus it should not be surprising that the trace of @xmath51 has a particular value in a quadratic field .    for our examples ,",
    "the monomorphism of @xmath42 is necessarily reducible , i.e.  it preserves a free product decomposition of @xmath42 into proper factors .",
    "mark sapir asked whether there are also examples where this monomorphism is irreducible .    for our examples",
    "@xmath42 is necessarily indiscrete .",
    "in fact this must always be the case .",
    "potyagailo and ohshika proved that any topologically tame non - elementary 3-dimensional kleinian group can not be conjugate in @xmath0 to a proper subgroup @xcite .",
    "since all finitely generated kleinian groups are topologically tame @xcite , this implies that there are no examples where the free group base of the hnn extension is discrete .",
    "both authors were partially supported by the u.s .  national science foundation ( grant # dms-0405491 ) and the sloan foundation .",
    "the basic idea here is to use the bass - serre tree to show that the `` universal '' group @xmath58 , where @xmath40 is viewed as parameter , is isomorphic to the free product @xmath45 .",
    "it will then easily follow that @xmath42 is also isomorphic to @xmath45 for generic choices of @xmath40 .    for notational convenience , we change our parameterization of the parabolic @xmath37 from @xmath59 to @xmath60 . in matrix form",
    "@xmath61 now let @xmath10 be the field of rational functions over @xmath62 .",
    "consider the homomorphism @xmath63 which is just the inclusion of @xmath0 into @xmath64 on the first factor , and sends the generator of @xmath65 to the above parabolic matrix .",
    "we claim that @xmath66 is injective .",
    "consider the discrete valuation on @xmath10 whose value on a rational function @xmath67 is the order of vanishing of @xmath67 at @xmath68 .",
    "let @xmath69 be the valuation ring of @xmath10 ; i.e.  the set of rational functions which do not have a pole at @xmath32 .",
    "note that @xmath69 is a local ring , and @xmath70 is its maximal ideal .",
    "then the action of @xmath64 on the bass - serre tree associated to this valuation gives us a splitting of @xmath64 as a free product with amalgamation as follows ( see @xcite or @xcite for details ) .",
    "let @xmath71 and @xmath72 be the conjugate of @xmath73 by @xmath74 if we set @xmath75 then @xmath76 .",
    "( see the top of page 81 of @xcite for this precise splitting in the analogous case of @xmath77}$ ] . )",
    "note that the map @xmath63 takes @xmath1 into the first factor of the amalgam and takes @xmath65 into the other .",
    "the condition that no element of @xmath1 fix @xmath33 exactly corresponds to the condition that the image @xmath78 in @xmath64 does not intersect the edge group @xmath79 joining the two factors of the amalgam . as @xmath80 is also disjoint from @xmath79 , the subgroup of @xmath64 generated by @xmath78 and @xmath80 is isomorphic to @xmath81 . thus @xmath66 is an isomorphism .    to complete the proof of the lemma , we will show that for a generic choice of @xmath40 , the composite of @xmath66 with the induced map @xmath82 is also injective .",
    "let @xmath83 and consider the set of @xmath40 for which @xmath84 maps to the identity under the map @xmath85 .",
    "such @xmath40 are the solutions to some polynomial equations in @xmath40 ; as @xmath66 is injective , these equations are nontrivial and have a finite solution set",
    ". as @xmath1 is finitely generated , there are only countably many such @xmath83 and hence only countably many `` bad '' values for @xmath40 .",
    "thus if we select @xmath36 from outside this countable set we have that @xmath42 is the free product @xmath45 , as desired .",
    "if , as is the case in our application , the entries of the elements of @xmath1 live in some number field @xmath55 , then one can simply take @xmath40 to be any transcendental number , e.g. @xmath86 or @xmath87 .",
    "our example of a fibered @xmath88-manifold satisfying requirement  [ requirement ] is the orientable double cover of the hyperbolic manifold @xmath89 from the callahan - hildebrand - weeks census @xcite that comes with snappea @xcite .",
    "the manifold @xmath3 is nonorientable and has one torus cusp .",
    "it has an ideal triangulation with @xmath90 tetrahedra .",
    "the shapes of these tetrahedra all lie in the field @xmath91 .",
    "the fundamental group of @xmath3 has a presentation @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the _ faithful _",
    "action of @xmath4 on @xmath34 is given by : @xmath95 where @xmath96 , a primitive @xmath97 root of unity .",
    "notice here that @xmath98 is orientation reversing , and that expressed as a matrix @xmath99 which has trace @xmath100 , as desired .    in a minute",
    ", we will pass to the orientation cover @xmath101 of @xmath3 to produce the needed example , but first let s observe that @xmath3 fibers over the circle .",
    "first notice that the defining relation for @xmath4 is in the commutator subgroup of the free group on @xmath98 and @xmath102 , and hence @xmath103 .",
    "consider the homomorphism @xmath104 given by @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "if we set @xmath107 and @xmath108 we see that the defining relation of @xmath4 becomes @xmath109 since the highest and lowest subscripts appear only once each , we see by magnus rewriting @xcite that the kernel of @xmath7 is freely generated by @xmath110 . thus by a theorem of stallings @xcite , the map @xmath111 induced by @xmath7",
    "can be homotoped to a fibration where the fundamental group of the fiber is the kernel of @xmath7 .",
    "( actually , for theorem  [ main - thm ] , we do nt really need stallings theorem since we have explicitly exhibited the desired free normal subgroup . however , ultimately the justification that this subgroup of matrices is free comes from identifying the full group of matrices with @xmath4 ; that is , the representation given above is faithful .",
    "this is seen by deriving the representation from a hyperbolic structure on @xmath3 , described by a geometric solution to the gluing equations for some ideal triangulation . )",
    "now pass to the orientable double cover @xmath101 of @xmath3 , whose fundamental group is @xmath114 .",
    "( for a dehn surgery description of @xmath101 , see figure  [ fig ] . )",
    "note that the kernel of @xmath7 restricted to @xmath115 hasnt changed and is still the free group @xmath1 of rank 5 .",
    "moreover , @xmath116 is not in @xmath1 as @xmath117 and , as we mentioned , the trace of @xmath116 is @xmath100 .",
    "thus @xmath101 satisfies requirement  [ requirement ] , and this completes the proof of theorem  [ main - thm ] .",
    "it is easy to use brown s elegant algorithm @xcite for computing the bieri - neumann - strebel invariant of a 1-relator group to see that any @xmath118 except @xmath119 and @xmath120 corresponds to a fibration .",
    "( here @xmath121 is the dual basis of @xmath122 with respect to the basis @xmath123 of @xmath124 . )",
    "this gives infinitely many other examples , where the rank of the free group in question grows more slowly than in examples obtained by taking subgroups of finite index in the kernel of @xmath125 .    of the @xmath126",
