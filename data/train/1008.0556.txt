    "although this article is about the approximation of invariant densities for interval maps , it is intimately related to what are commonly termed _ open dynamical systems _ or maps with ` holes ' @xcite .",
    "open dynamical systems have become a very active area of research . in part , this is due to their connection to metastable dynamical systems @xcite and their applications in earth and ocean sciences @xcite .",
    "corresponding to invariant measures for closed dynamics , in open dynamical systems , long - term statistics are described by a _ conditionally invariant measure _ and its related _ escape rate _ , measuring the mass lost from the system per unit time @xcite .    in their recent article @xcite , keller and",
    "liverani obtained precise escape rate formulae for lasota - yorke maps with holes shrinking to a single point .",
    "these formulae depend , _ pointwise _ , on the invariant density of the corresponding closed system .",
    "unfortunately , explicit formulae of invariant densities for lasota - yorke maps are , in general , unavailable .",
    "thus , to complement the result of @xcite , it is natural to consider numerical schemes which provide rigorous and computable pointwise approximations of invariant densities .    in the literature ,",
    "rigorous approximation results are available in the @xmath1-norm @xcite , the @xmath0-norm @xcite and in the @xmath2-norm , the space of function of bounded variation , @xcite , for example .",
    "none of these methods are well - suited to our problem .",
    "for example @xmath1 approximations can not provide the pointwise information necessary for application of the formulae of @xcite ( see section 7 in @xcite ) .",
    "convergence schemes in the @xmath0-norm and @xmath2-norm can not provide a computable error bound as the constant in their approximation error depends on the invariant density itself , which is _ a priori _ unknown .    by rigorous and computable approximation",
    "we mean the following .",
    "assume we are given a transformation @xmath3 ( typically , a formula ) and an error tolerance , for example @xmath4 .",
    "we choose a suitable discretization scheme for the transfer ( frobenius - perron ) operator associated to @xmath3 and we are asked to determine an explicit level of discretization @xmath5 such that the approximate invariant density @xmath6 for the discretize operator at level @xmath5 satisfies @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the invariant density for @xmath3 .",
    "we emphasize that we assume the continuous density @xmath8 is unknown throughout this calculation . by computable we mean",
    "that , at each step , one can determine via an algorithm , within a finite number of steps , each quantity necessary to determine @xmath6 and to guarantee inequality ( [ eqn : approx ] ) .",
    "one novelty of our approach is that we will need to consider two different discretization schemes in order to carry out this task , both based on binned discretization of the state space .",
    "the results in this paper enable us to compute the number of bins @xmath9 , with @xmath10 , and the associated approximate density , as usual denoted @xmath11 which achieves the tolerance @xmath12 , uniformly .",
    "the first ingredient in our analysis uses a natural piecewise linear discretization scheme and the abstract perturbation result of @xcite .",
    "the two banach spaces involved in our computation are @xmath0 , and the space of lipschitz continuous functions on the unit interval .",
    "the same banach spaces were used in @xcite to provide a computer - assisted estimate on the rate of decay of correlations . however , the discretization scheme which was used in @xcite is the traditional ulam method .",
    "ulam s method does not fit in our setting since it does not preserve the regularity of the space of lipschitz continuous functions .",
    "the idea of our method is to first prove an appropriate lasota - yorke inequality for transfer operators associated with markov interval maps , then to construct a discretized transfer operator which preserves the regularity of the space of lipschitz continuous functions and which is close , in some suitable norm , to the original transfer operator .",
    "although , neither the original transfer operator nor its discretized counterpart is a contraction in the @xmath0-norm setting where the norm of the transfer operator is automatically @xmath13 , here we can only show that @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is typically greater than or equal to 1 .",
    "] , we obtain quasi - compactness of the original transfer operator , thanks to the result of @xcite .",
    "we use the general setting of @xcite which allows the study of perturbations of transfer operators which are not necessarily contractions on either banach space . with this machinery",
    ", we can compute an explicit upper bound on the norm of the resolvent , bounded away from the spectrum , of the transfer operator associated with the map .",
    "once an upper bound on the norm of the resolvent is computed , we use a second discretization scheme , whose associated finite rank operator is markov , to compute an approximate invariant density with the pre - specified error tolerance @xmath12 .",
    "the reason for using two different discretizations in our method is the following : the first discretization has the projection property .",
    "this property is essential in the proofs related to the computation of an an explicit upper bound on the norm of the resolvent .",
    "moreover , it produces reasonable constants which are needed when using the perturbation result of @xcite .",
    "however , this natural discretization leads to a non - markovian finite rank operator .",
    "the lack of the markov property makes the ( theoretical ) rate of convergence slow .",
    "thus , at the next stage , we use a different discretization , which lacks the projection property , but produces a finite rank operator which is markov . with this markov scheme",
    "we will obtain a computable rate of convergence which is of order @xmath16 .",
    "in section [ spaces ] we set up our notation and assumptions .",
    "we also recall known results on markov interval maps which are needed in the sequel . in section [ inequality ] we provide a lasota - yorke inequality on the space of lipschitz continuous functions .",
    "in section [ discretization ] we present our two discretization schemes and prove results about their regularity properties when acting on the space of lipschitz continuous functions . in section [ perturbation ] we present the perturbation result of @xcite as a sequence of steps which are necessary for rigorous computations and in section [ sec : kl_applied ]",
    "we apply the perturbation result to our problem .",
    "the main challenge of this paper lies in this section where we design an algorithm which enables one to rigorously compute an upper bound on the norm of the resolvent of the continuous transfer operator .",
    "the resolvent estimate can then be used to obtain a rate of convergence @xmath17 in section [ rates ] , where @xmath18 is a computable constant . in section [ exam ]",

    "the situation is analogous to the failure to obtain rate @xmath309 for ulam s method via spectral perturbation arguments ; see @xcite .",
    "] however , different proofs will lead to different constants multiplied by this rate .",
    "since our target is to produce explicit computation of the error bound , we write the proof in a way which makes the constants as small as possible .    [ th2 ] for any @xmath312 , we have @xmath313    we have @xmath314 using lemmas [ decay ] and [ lip : bd ] , for any @xmath315 we obtain @xmath316 in @xmath317 the problem is that we only have the weak estimate @xmath318 .",
    "however , we know from lemma [ le1 ] that for all @xmath67 , @xmath319 .",

    ", one expects that the both discretization schemes should be more efficient than indicated by the above theoretical estimates .",
    "we conclude this article with a simple numerical example ( non - rigorous ) that shows the kind of performance one should be looking for , even in the non - markov discretization case .",
