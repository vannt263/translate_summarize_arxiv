    "volatile prices of the rare - earth elements observed in the recent years have motivated wide research initiatives in an effort to find replacement materials for the permanent magnets industry , which would use little or none of the rare - earth elements .",
    "late @xmath20 transition elements , such as mn , fe or co are the primary candidates for such materials , thanks to their large and stable magnetic moments and high magnetic transition temperatures found in many of the compounds they form .",
    "however , weak spin - orbital interaction strength typically causes low magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy ( mae ) , which in turn means that they often lack appreciable coercivity , forming soft magnetic materials . under certain circumstances ,",
    "however , the mae of 3@xmath21 transition metal compounds can be substantial , for example the tetragonally distorted fe / co alloys  @xcite , l1@xmath22 phases such as feni , coni , mnal  @xcite , fe@xmath23n@xmath1  @xcite , ( fe / co)@xmath1b  @xcite or fe@xmath1p - based alloys  @xcite .",
    "a general overview on rare - earth - free permanent magnets is available in ref .",
    "all of the above mentioned systems are hexagonal or tetragonal , i.e. , uniaxial .",
    "for this reason , in this work we have focused on an iron - based system fe@xmath0sib@xmath1 and its alloys ( fe@xmath9co@xmath10)@xmath0sib@xmath1 and fe@xmath0si@xmath9p@xmath10b@xmath1 - they are tetragonal and rich on magnetic elements .",
    "fe@xmath0sib@xmath1  @xcite and fe@xmath0pb@xmath1  @xcite are isomorphous with cr@xmath0b@xmath24 .",
    "they were initially reported by aronsson and engstrm  @xcite and rundqvist  @xcite in 1960 and 1962 .",
    "several other borides crystallize within the same structure type . in the more general formula @xmath25sib@xmath1 for the silico - borides , @xmath26 may stand for ( mn , fe , mo)@xcite , v  @xcite , nb  @xcite or w  @xcite . the recently discovered nb@xmath0sib@xmath1 and",
    "w@xmath0sib@xmath1 have been recognized as superconductors .",

    "[ fig : structure ] .",
    "rundqvist stated that the distribution of p and b atoms in fe@xmath0pb@xmath1 was ordered and had a narrow homogeneity range  @xcite . both fe@xmath0pb@xmath1 and fe@xmath0sib@xmath1 crystallize in the cr@xmath0b@xmath24-type structure  @xcite with body - centered tetragonal ( bct ) unit cell , space group i4/mcm ,",

    "single unit cell of fe@xmath29b@xmath1 contains 32 atoms divided into 4 formula units .",
    "fe@xmath28 atoms are distributed on the 16-fold position , b on the 8-fold , fe@xmath1 and si / p on the 4-fold position , respectively .",
    "the fe@xmath0sib@xmath1 and fe@xmath0pb@xmath1 structures have a principally ordered arrangement of si / p and b on their respective crystallographic sites , but some intermixing occurs as well as interstitial accommodations of b , si and p. furthermore , octahedral holes of sufficient size for small non - metal atoms exist in the system .",
    "aronsson and engstrm  @xcite found it likely that some of the boron atoms may be interstitially accommodated in these holes .",
    "moreover , rundqvist  @xcite described two types of holes in the cr@xmath0b@xmath24-type lattice , trigonal prismatic and anti - prismatic ones . in the fe@xmath0pb@xmath1 system the radii of the trigonal prismatic and anti - prismatic holes are 0.93   and 1.08   , respectively , while the b radius is 0.88   . a homogeneity range of fe@xmath0sib@xmath1 with the substitutions of b for si has been observed previously .",
    "fe@xmath0sib@xmath1 measured by aronsson and engstrm  @xcite have b / si ratio slightly larger than 2.00 .",

    "the differences between mae calculated by us and by mcguire and parker most likely come from the fact that we have used the optimized lattice parameters instead of the experimental ones .",
    "the fact that we employed the fplo and mcguire and parker used the wien2k should not lead to substantial differences  @xcite .",
    "we have presented an experimental study of structural and magnetic properties of fe@xmath0sib@xmath1 polycrystalline materials .",

    "theoretical study of volume variation and fully relativistic fixed spin moment calculations of stoichiometric fe@xmath0sib@xmath1 evidences a strong inverse dependency between mae and total magnetic moment , leading to a maximal value of mae  =  1.78  mj / m@xmath8 for @xmath53  =  6.15@xmath11/f.u . , while equilibrium magnetic moment is 9.20@xmath11/f.u .",
    "alloying of fe@xmath0sib@xmath1 with co is suggested to reproduce reduction of magnetic moment .",

    "also further increase of mae of ( fe@xmath17co@xmath18)@xmath0sib@xmath1 is expected by doping with some of @xmath55- or @xmath56-elements .",
    "for fe@xmath0si@xmath9p@xmath10b@xmath1 a monotonic trend in mae has been obtained , suggesting that at low temperatures and below @xmath57 the alloys should have in - plane magnetization , while above @xmath57 the magnetization should point along the @xmath32-axis .",
    "the overall mae values are rather low , suggesting that fe@xmath0si@xmath9p@xmath10b@xmath1 class of materials can only form soft magnets .",
    "on the other hand the hypothetical fe@xmath0p@xmath9s@xmath10b@xmath1 compositions with sulfur exhibit increased mae with the highest value of 0.77  mj / m@xmath8 for fe@xmath0p@xmath14s@xmath15b@xmath1 and mae  =  0.67  mj / m@xmath8 for fe@xmath0sb@xmath1 .",
