    "it is now mandatory to discuss the statistical requirements needed to take advantage of high - energy @xmath152 from astrophysical sources to look for signals of sterile neutrinos .",
    "first of all , we remind how different flavor could be identified in a neutrino telescope experiment . as it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , muon - like events can be identified with a good efficiency by looking for a single up - going muon entering the detector , whose energy can be estimated from the amount of erenkov light produced by photons and @xmath153 pairs radiated from the muon track .",
    "these are called `` track events '' .    a second class of events are those in which the release of a large amount of erenkov light , generated by a shower induced by a neutrino interaction in the detector volume , is observed .",
    "this signal is produced mainly by @xmath154 cc interactions , albeit with a ( significant ) contribution by @xmath155 and @xmath156 cc interactions and nc interactions of the three active neutrino flavors .",
    "a good knowledge of `` track events '' and `` shower events '' is needed to have a handle on the @xmath8 flavor ratio ( see , for example , ref .",
    "moreover , the @xmath157 and @xmath155 fluxes must be known with a good precision to quantify the high - energy atmospheric neutrino background atmospheric neutrino events with energies @xmath158 gev are expected in 10 years of data taking at icecube , @xcite . ] that is relevant for @xmath159 gev . however , as it can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig14](left ) and [ fig : fig15](left ) , the ratio of `` shower '' to `` track events '' is strongly dependent on the spectral shape of the flavor fluxes .",
    "this introduces a further problem in the utilization of this observable to look for new physics beyond the three - family neutrino mixing scenario or to pin down the details of the astrophysical source of the high - energy neutrinos .",
    "eventually , @xmath156 cc interactions can be singled out by looking for `` double bang '' or `` lollipop '' events @xcite .",
    "the former are events in which two distinct energy releases are observed inside the detector volume , with space and time separation consistent with the propagation and decay of an energetic @xmath148 .",
    "the latter consist of events in which the second `` double bang '' shower is observed along the @xmath148 track , but the first is missed .",
    "both event classes are specific to @xmath156 cc interactions .",
    "inverted lollipops ( where the second shower is missed and the first one is observed ) are not useful to identify @xmath148 events , since they can be confused with an energetic @xmath155 cc interaction in which a hadronic shower is reconstructed together with a muon track .",
    "the ratio of the sum of `` double bang '' and `` lollipop events '' to `` track events '' is , thus , a measure of @xmath9 .",
    "we should now try to specify the statistical requirements needed to use flavor ratios at neutrino telescopes ( measurable as explained above ) to look for new physics from astrophysical high - energy neutrinos .",
    "two sources have been considered in this paper : agn s and grb s .",
    "for both sources , we lack of an accurate model to predict the expected neutrino rates , and we can only compute their flavor ratios .",
    "this is useless , however , if we can not establish if the observation of a deviation of flavor ratios from the three - family neutrino mixing expectation can indeed be a signal of new physics or it can just be ascribed to statistical fluctuations of the standard values .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the present catalogues of tev @xmath1-ray sources were used to infer the expected neutrino fluxes to be measured at neutrino telescope experiments .",
    "indeed , the hadronic interactions that are the source of astrophysical neutrino fluxes also create a large number of @xmath160 and @xmath60 particles .",
    "these particles decay eventually to photons , generating a high - energy @xmath1 flux . for a transparent source in which photons are produced mainly by this process",
    ", the relation that can be inferred on the neutrino flux by the observation of a high - energy photon flux is robust .",
    "the neutrino flux is as large as the photon flux , at least .",
    "the three brightest @xmath1-ray sources detected by the hess telescope are the crab nebula , rxj1713.7 - 3946 and vela junior @xcite .",
    "their integrated flux above 1 tev is @xmath161 ( cm@xmath3 s)@xmath163 , respectively .",
    "the photon emission of the last two objects is believed to be of hadronic origin .",
    "considering a photon flux half that of rxj1713.7 - 3946 and vela junior , produced through hadronic mechanism , the corresponding neutrino flux above 1 tev is @xmath164 ( cm@xmath3 s)@xmath163 . using this neutrino flux , with an unbroken power law spectrum ,",
    "the total number of @xmath165 and @xmath148 contained events that can be observed in a km@xmath166 water equivalent detector is 10.3 , 9.6 and 2.9 per year , respectively .",
    "the expected flux of up - going @xmath152-induced muons is @xmath167 ( km@xmath3 year ) @xmath163 .",
    "these numbers take into account the different neutrino flavor energy spectra , as in fig .  3 of ref .",
    "@xcite , the neutrino - nucleon cross - sections and the earth absorption , but not the detector efficiency to identify a given neutrino flavor .",
    "similar results have been found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the photon emission of the brightest agn s present in the tev @xmath1-ray catalogue ( mkn421 and mkn501 ) @xcite is strongly varying with time . in the emission peaks",
    ", their average photon flux above 1 tev can be several times that of the crab nebula .",
    "the extrapolation from the photon flux to the neutrino flux is difficult , however , since we have no indication on the hadronic or leptonic origin of the photon emission .    considering for agn s and grb s a flux similar to that of a galactic point source of the example given in ref .",
    "@xcite , we should get @xmath168 @xmath157 and @xmath155 events and @xmath169 @xmath156 events after 10 years of data taking at a km@xmath166 detector .",
    "similar statistics has been used in ref .",
    "@xcite to study neutrino decay at neutrino telescopes .",
    "it is easy to see that such statistics is too small to disentangle a ( 3 + 1 ) sterile neutrino effect from the statistical fluctuations of the three - family neutrino signals , even in the case of @xmath6 near to its experimental limit , @xmath170 .",
    "the uncertainties on the three - family parameters within the presently allowed region in @xmath9 are @xmath171 .",
    "the ( gaussian ) statistical fluctuations in @xmath9 ( after 10 years of data taking in the case of an ideal detector , given the numbers above ) can be as large as 20% at 1@xmath25 .",
    "the expected three - family @xmath9 flavor ratio is , thus , @xmath172 , to be compared with @xmath173 .",
    "this means that it is extremely difficult that ( 3 + 1 ) sterile neutrinos produced by a single source can be observed and unequivocally distinguished from theoretical and statistical fluctuations of the three - family mixing scenario in the next generation of neutrino telescopes .",
    "a factor 30 more statistics is needed to detect unambiguously a sterile neutrino signal with maximal @xmath6 .",
    "a possible way out of this problem is to integrate over all the galactic and extragalactic sources ( or , for example , to sum over many grb s events of similar intensities ) . in this case , it is possible that the next generation of neutrino telescopes could observe or constrain the four - family mixing model by looking at the @xmath9 flavor ratio .",
    "no signal can be expected from the @xmath8 one .",
    "we have studied the effects of the ( 3 + 1)-scheme , which is constrained by all the experimental data except lsnd , on the flux ratio of the high energy cosmic neutrinos . in principle , if a large number of events are accumulated in the future , there is still a chance to have a signature of the ( 3 + 1)-scheme .",
    "furthermore , we have taken into account the theoretical uncertainties which were discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the case of high energy neutrinos from grb . while these uncertainties make the prediction for the observed ratio @xmath12 ambiguous , the ratio @xmath13 is less sensitive to the uncertainties and is sensitive to the sterile neutrino mixing angle @xmath6 .",
    "the energy spectrum of these flux ratios can also give us the information on the theoretical uncertainties , particularly that of the muon energy loss . while the statistical errors of data from a galactic point source in the next generation of neutrino telescopes are estimated to be too large to distinguish the three and four family schemes , if we can gain statistics by , e.g. , summing over data from many sources",
    ", then it might be possible to have a signature for the ( 3 + 1)-scheme in observations of the high energy cosmic neutrinos .",
    "more detailed studies on the systematic errors to identify @xmath156 as well as the theoretical uncertainties would be necessary to derive quantitative conclusions .",
    "at second order in @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath79 , the picture is far more entangled .",
    "both @xmath54 and @xmath55 are present , together with the three cp - violating phases .",
    "notice that @xmath174 always appears in combination with the phase factor @xmath175 , both in the expressions for the flavor fluxes and in the flavor ratios.we therefore define the reduced parameter @xmath176 , where @xmath81 as in eq .",
