    "in this paper the dynamics of a random chain subjected to thermal fluctuations at fixed temperature @xmath0 is discussed .",
    "this problem is usually treated phenomenologically , regarding the fluctuations of the chain as a stochastic process which may be described with the help of langevin equations or , alternatively , of fokker - planck equations @xcite .",
    "this approach leads to the well known models of rouse @xcite and zimm @xcite which allow a satisfactory understanding of the main properties of polymers in solutions .",
    "one major drawback of these coarse grained models is , that they suffer from the presence of rigid constraints .",
    "the rouse and rouse  zimm equation consider only chains bead spring models of chains , where the local spring is infinitely extensible . in the framework of continuous models",
    "the rouse equation for example is nothing but the stochastic equation ( langevin equation ) for the classical wiener measure , which yields paths which do not have a well defined tangent vectors @xcite .",
    "these problems have been tackled by various attempts , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "however , the correct use of rigid constraints in ( stochastic ) dynamics requires some mathematical effort @xcite , in contrast to the static cases where rigid constraints can be implemented by dirac delta functions in the partition function",
    ".    however , it seems to be too difficult to extend these approaches , therefore we follow here some different routes . moreover the use of dynamic constraints for ( stochastic dynamics equation ) is always problematic .    here",
    "the dynamics of random chains is considered from a microscopic point of view .",
    "the chain is represented as a set of freely jointed segments of fixed lengths .",
    "small masses are attached at the joints .",
    "the goal is to construct the probability function @xmath1 $ ] of this system . roughly speaking this function",
    "measures the probability that a chain starting from a given initial conformation conf@xmath2 at the time @xmath3 arrives to a given final conformation conf@xmath4 at time @xmath5 . during its motion from the initial to the final conformation",
    "the chain spans a two dimensional surface . in this way one obtains a _ stringy _ formulation of the chain dynamics , which is based on path integrals @xcite .",
    "the chain `` world - sheet '' is a rectangle whose sides are given by the length of the chain and the time interval @xmath6 .",
    "the basic ingredient in the construction of the probability function @xmath1 $ ] is the energy of a discrete freely jointed chain with @xmath7 segments . while it is easy to add external and internal interactions acting on the segments of the chain , the complicated form of the kinetic energy poses serious obstacles to the possibility of computing the probability function analytically .",
    "the kinetic energy is in fact nonlinear and has an intrinsically non - markoffian nature .",
    "this is due to the fact that the velocity of each segment in the chain depends on the velocities of the other segments . in this situation ,",
    "it is difficult to isolate in the energy a linear term which could give raise to a propagator , so that even perturbative calculations are not allowed .",
    "luckily , the expression of the kinetic energy simplifies considerably after performing the limit in which the chain becomes a continuous curve .",
    "the final form of the probability function which one obtains in this limit closely resembles the partition function of a nonlinear sigma model @xcite .",
    "the difference with respect to the standard nonlinear sigma model is that in the latter case the modulus of the fields is constrained , while in the present case the constraint involves the modulus of the derivative of the fields with respect to the arc - length of the chain .",
    "this constraint is related to our assumption that the lengths of the segments is fixed .    within our formalism",
    "it is possible to add constraints to the trajectory of the chain with the help of dirac @xmath8functions as in the case of the statistical mechanics of random chains @xcite .",
    "here we have considered just the simplest example of constraints , namely the requirement that the trajectory of the chain is closed . besides , it is easy to treat non - homogeneous chains , in which both lengths of the segments and the masses located at the points are arbitrary .",
    "the probability functions is constructed for two and three dimensional random chains . in three dimensions",
    "one may introduce further constraints , which fix for instance the lengths of the projections of the segments on the @xmath9 axis . in this way we are able to discuss also rigid chains , in which the segments are allowed to form only a given angle with respect to the @xmath9 axis .",
    "the material presented in this paper is divided as follows . in section",
    "ii the expression of the kinetic energy of a discrete chain with @xmath7 segments is derived in two dimensions using a recursive method .",
    "the rules of the passage to the continuous limit are established .",
    "after this limit is performed , important simplifications occur . to further simplify the problem ,",
    "one of the ends of the chain is fixed at a given point .",
    "moreover , it is supposed that the distributions of masses and segment lengths along the chain are uniform . it is shown that under these assumptions the kinetic energy of the continuous chain may be written in terms of free complex scalar fields subjected to a constraint .",
    "the origin of this constraint is the requirement that the lengths of the segments are constant . in section",
    "iii the classical solutions of a free chain are studied . in section",
    "iv a stringy approach to the dynamics of the chain in two dimensions is established .",
    "the probability function is constructed using path integrals .",
    "the resulting model closely resembles a nonlinear supersymmetric model .",
    "the problem of fixing various boundary conditions , including the case of closed chain trajectories , is discussed . a perturbative approach based on the expansion of the fields describing the statistical fluctuations over a classical background",
    "is provided . in section v the results of sections ii ",
    "iv are extended to three dimensional chains . in section vi chains with constant bending angles",

    "we restrict ourselves to the case of a free chain .",

    "as we have already seen , in this way the expression of the kinetic energy @xmath188 is simply : @xmath212 however , one has to take into account also the constraints : @xmath213 we assume as before that all segments have the same fixed length @xmath214 , but additionally we require that : @xmath215 this implies that the projection of each segment onto the @xmath216axis has length @xmath217 , so that the segments are bound to form with the @xmath216axis the fixed angles @xmath218 or @xmath219 defined by the relations : @xmath220 clearly , in both cases the constraints ( [ constrewrite ] ) and ( [ addrequir ] ) may be rewritten as follows : @xmath221 we suppose now that only the angle @xmath222 is allowed , so that the chain can not make turns in the @xmath9 direction .",
    "an example of a conformation of a chain satisfying these assumptions is given in fig  [ motconang ] .     with the @xmath216axis .",
    "in the figure @xmath223 , width=302 ]    the constraints ( [ constralpha ] ) are solved by choosing spherical coordinates , in which however the angles @xmath224 formed by the segments with the @xmath216axis are always equal to @xmath225 : @xmath226 as we see from the above equation , each segment is left only with the freedom of rotations around the @xmath216direction , corresponding to the angles @xmath227 . moreover ,",
    "the total length of the chain is always @xmath228 , but now also the total height @xmath229 of the trajectory along the @xmath216axis is fixed : @xmath230 at this point , we pass to the continuous limit , this time taking as parameter describing the trajectory of the chain the variable @xmath9 instead of the arc - length @xmath86 . due to the last of eqs .",
    "( [ coordsab ] ) , the @xmath216components of the velocities are always zero : @xmath231 as a consequence , we are left with a two dimensional problem , which may be treated in exactly the same way as we treated the two dimensional chain of section  [ sec2 ] .",
    "the only difference is that eqs .",
    "( [ carpol2 ] ) should be replaced by eqs .",
    "( [ varonedf ] ) and ( [ vartwodf ] ) and the constraints have a slightly different form .",
    "following the same procedure presented in section  [ sec2 ] we find after a few calculation the expression of the kinetic energy : @xmath232 and of the constraint ( [ constralpha ] ) : @xmath233 apart from the appearance of the factor @xmath234 and the choice of the height @xmath9 instead of the arc - length @xmath86 , eqs .",
    "( [ kcont3dalphaone ] ) and ( [ constralphacont ] ) are identical to eqs .",
    "( [ tcont ] ) and ( [ constrthreedone ] ) in the limit @xmath235 .",
    "it is now not difficult to show that the probability distribution @xmath236 is given by : @xmath237 where @xmath238 \\label{djfjskdflds}\\ ] ]    at this point we discuss briefly the case in which both angles @xmath239 and @xmath225 are allowed . in this situation",
    ", the trajectory of the chain may have turns .",
    "an example of motion of this kind is given in fig  [ turnedchain ] .",
    "or @xmath239 with the @xmath216axis . in the figure @xmath223 .",
    "turning points are emphasized by means of black points.,width=302 ]    the constraints ( [ constrewrite ] ) and ( [ addrequir ] ) remain unchanged , but the coordinate @xmath9 can not be chosen as a valid parameter of the trajectory of the chain and one has to come back to the arc - length @xmath86 .",
    "the most serious problem occurs due to the fact that the variables @xmath240 are not continuous functions of the time , since each @xmath240 is allowed to jump discretely between the two discrete values @xmath241 and @xmath242 , corresponding to the angles @xmath225 and @xmath239 respectively .",
    "it is therefore difficult to define the components @xmath243 of the velocities of the ends of the segments and thus their contribution to the kinetic energy .",
    "let us note that this problem affects only the @xmath9 degrees of freedom .",
    "the degrees of freedom @xmath244 and @xmath245 of the chain remain continuous functions of @xmath32 despite the jumps of the @xmath194 s .",
    "this fact can be easily verified looking at the definition of @xmath244 and @xmath245 in eqs .",
    "( [ varonedf ] ) and ( [ vartwodf ] ) .",
    "since @xmath246 , both the @xmath244 s and @xmath245 s are not affected by the jumps of the angle @xmath247 .",
    "the situation simplifies only if the chain has no interactions in which the @xmath9 variable is involved .",
    "the reason is that in the kinetic energy and in the constraints given by eqs .",
    "( [ kthreedrewrite][addrequir ] ) the degrees of freedom connected to the motion along the @xmath216directions are decoupled from the other degrees of freedom and may be ignored . as a consequence , in absence of @xmath216dependent interactions , the difficulties related to the motion along the @xmath216direction",
    "disappear and once again the problem reduces to that the two dimensional chain treated in section  [ sec2 ] . since the constraints are always those of eqs .",
    "( [ kthreedrewrite][addrequir ] ) one may proceed as in the case of fixed angle @xmath225 . as a result",
    ", one finds that the final probability distribution is of the form : @xmath248 where @xmath249 \\label{djfjskdfldws}\\ ] ] and @xmath250 is a constant containing the result of the integration over the decoupled @xmath9 degrees of freedom .",
    "let us note in eqs .",
    "( [ 3ddirfiwn ] ) and ( [ djfjskdfldws ] ) the appearance of the factor @xmath251 in the action instead of @xmath234 and the replacement of @xmath9 with the arc - length @xmath86 as the parameter of the trajectory of the chain .",
    "the dynamics of a random chain has been discussed both from the classical and statistical point of view .",
    "the classical energy of the chain has been derived in two and three dimensions .",
    "we have mainly concentrated ourselves on the computation of the kinetic energy because the addition of the contribution of the interactions to the total energy is straightforward , see eqs .",
    "( [ eneext ] ) and ( [ eneint ] ) .",
    "the kinetic energy on the contrary has a complicated and non - markoffian expression as shown by eq .",
    "( [ tdiscr ] ) in two - dimensions and by eq .",
    "( [ kdisc3d ] ) in three dimensions . after passing to the continuous limit discussed in section",
    "ii , one term disappears from the kinetic energy .",
    "this is the reason for which in the continuous case the classical equations of motion have simple solutions of the form given in eqs .",
    "( [ xclone])([xcltwo ] ) .",
    "let us note that the passage to the continuous limit is straightforward and does not need mathematical subtleties as the analogous limit by which the edwards model is obtained in the statistical mechanics of random chains .",
    "the stringy approach to the dynamics of random chains is formulated in section iv .",
    "one would naively expect that the final model is related with non - relativistic string theories , such as those derived in refs .",
    "@xcite , but this is not the case . in two and three dimensions the probability distributions @xmath150 and @xmath204 are respectively given in eqs.([psifixlen ] ) and ( [ finalthreedparfun])([fdsfgf ] ) . as it is possible to see from these equations , the path integral sums which provide the expressions of @xmath150 and @xmath204 have the form of a @xmath252 nonlinear sigma model on a two dimensional world - sheet , where @xmath253 depending on the dimensionality of the physical space in which the chains fluctuate .",
    "the difference with respect to the nonlinear sigma model is that here the derivatives of the fields with respect to the arc - length @xmath86 are subjected to the condition @xmath254 . in standard nonlinear sigma models",
    "it is instead the modulus of the fields themselves to be constrained .",
    "the presence of a complicated constraint and the absence of a small parameter which could be used to start a perturbative expansion complicate the computation of the probability functions .",
    "for this reason , in section iv it has been proposed the field splitting ( [ decomp ] ) .",
    "this splitting provides a convenient way to deal with the boundary conditions satisfied by the fields @xmath161 and also allows a perturbative treatment provided the initial and final conformations @xmath181 and @xmath255 do not differ very much in the sense of eq .",
    "( [ pertcond ] ) .",
    "alternatively , the statistical fluctuations @xmath169 may be eliminated from the partition function of eq .",
    "( [ acthclaqlagmult ] ) with a gaussian integration , but then one ends up with a complicated two dimensional field theory in which the lagrange multipliers @xmath177 are coupled together with the classical background @xmath163 . another possibility in order to simplify the model consists in relaxing the constraint @xmath254 , imposing for instance the weaker condition @xmath256 .",
    "this constraint requires that the average length of the chain in the interval of time @xmath257 is @xmath57 . in this case",
    "the lagrange multiplier @xmath258 does no longer depend on @xmath32 and @xmath86 and calculations become easier",
    ". it would also be interesting to study the probability functions @xmath150 and @xmath204 in the limit @xmath259 and @xmath260 or to sum them over all possible values of the initial and final conformations @xmath261 .",
    "finally , chains with fixed angles have been discussed in section vi .",
    "our approach is valid only if the chain has no turning points .",
    "if there are turning points the kinetic energy is not well defined , because the variable @xmath206 is no longer a continuous function and thus its time derivative becomes a distribution .",
    "one way for adding to our treatment turning points as those of fig .",
    "[ turnedchain ] is to replace the variable @xmath9 with a stochastic variable which is allowed to take only discrete values .",
    "another way is to look at turning points as points in which the chain bounces against an invisible obstacle .",
    "a field theory describing a one - dimensional chain with such kind of non - holonomic constraints has been already derived in refs .",
    "the problem of turning points is currently work in progress , as well as the possibility of imposing topological constraints on the trajectory of the chain .",
