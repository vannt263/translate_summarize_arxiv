    "since its proposal , the random boolean network model [ 1 ] has successfully described in a qualitative way several important aspects of gene regulation and cell differentiation processes ( for references see [ 2 ] ) .",
    "the model is constructed by assigning to each of the genes its regulatory inputs from among the large number of genes present in the network .",
    "the model consists of @xmath0 binary variables , corresponding to the two states of gene expression ( off and on ) . in this binary setting , each gene is assigned a logical function on its inputs showing its next activity . while clearly an idealization , much has been learned from this class of large boolean networks , and major features generalize to a class of piecewise linear differential equations [ 3 - 4 ] and a family of polynomial maps [ 5 ] .",
    "the research on complex boolean networks , shows that networks behave in three regimes : ordered , critical and chaotic [ 6 ] .",
    "it is a very attractive hypothesis that cell types have evolved by natural selection to lie in the ordered regime , close to the critical phase transition , where the most complex coordinated behaviors can occur [ 7 - 8 ] . in this deterministic setting , it is almost an inevitable hypothesis that the distinct cell types of an organism correspond to the distinct attractors of the network .",
    "this hypothesis needs to be confirmed by experimental tests .",
    "cell differentiation consists in response to a perturbation or signal that places the network in a different basin of attraction from which it flows to a new attractor .",
    "obviously , real genetic networks are not boolean nets . in real nets",
    ", one has to take into account the molecular dynamics by using stochastic differential equation models .",
    "the resulted equations can be solved using monte - carlo methods . here",
    "the favored approach is the gillespie algorithm [ 9 ] , which can be used to model discrete molecular events of transcription , translation and gene control in complex reaction networks .",
    "boolean networks already impose some formidable computational problems .",
    "introducing stochastic models render even smaller networks computationally intractable because the number of reactions one has to consider grows exponentially fast with the number of genes in the network .    here , we propose a simplified mean - field model of the genetic regulatory network , where the main idea is to replace all regulatory interactions to any one gene with an average or effective interaction , which takes into account the repression and activation mechanisms .",
    "our model attempts to bridge the gap between random boolean networks and more realistic stochastic modeling of regulatory networks . in this model ,",
    "the regulatory interactions are described by differential equations corresponding to the chemical reactions considered in the genetic network .",
    "the same set of chemical reactions can , for example , be used in a stochastic simulation of the network . from this point of view",
    ", the proposed model gives a mean - field description of the more accurate stochastic approach . in the mean - field deterministic description ,",
    "the gene - expression state at a given time and the regulatory interactions among them unambiguously determine the gene - expression state at the next time . in a stochastic system ,",
    "on the other hand , a given gene - expression state can generate more than one successive gene - expression states , and therefore , different cells of the same population may follow a different gene - expression path . as a result of these considerations ,",
    "the stochastic model describe the kinetics of gene regulation more accurately than a deterministic model .",
    "however , a deterministic mean - field model can be transformed in a stochastic model by incorporating noise .",
    "this approach results in a stochastic differential equation or langevin equation .",
    "it is well known that the langevin equation is asymptotically equivalent ( under certain conditions ) to the chemical master equation [ 10 ] .",
    "therefore , the proposed mean - field model is still relevant for the description of gene regulation and cell differentiation processes . we show that depending on the set of regulatory parameters , the model exhibits differing behaviors corresponding to ordered and chaotic dynamics .",
    "this result gives quantitative support to the earlier qualitative results obtained for random boolean networks .",
    "also , we show that the system acquires stability by increasing the number of interactions .",
    "this conclusion provides a possible explanation of how diversity and stability are created in a biological system , giving rise to a great variety of stable living organisms .",
    "for the beginning , let us analyze the gene expression process [ 11 - 14 ] . in a genetic regulatory network , genes can be turned on or off by the binding of proteins to regulatory sites on the dna [ 1 ] .",
    "the proteins are known as transcription factors , while the dna binding sites are known as promoters .",
    "transcription factors can regulate the production of other transcription factors , or they can regulate their own production .",
    "the simplest model of gene expression involves only two steps in which the genetic information is first transcribed into messenger rna ( @xmath1 ) and then translated into proteins ( @xmath2 ) by ribosomes ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the transcription process can be described by a sequence of reactions , in which the rna polymerase ( @xmath4 ) binds to the gene promoter ( @xmath5 ) leading to transcription of a complete @xmath6 molecule : @xmath7 here , @xmath8 corresponds to the complex formed in the intermediate reaction @xmath9 , with constant rate @xmath10 .",
    "since the waiting times are independent statistical quantities , the waiting time for the whole sequence of intermediate complex formation is the sum of the waiting times for the individual steps .",
    "also , we should note that the central limit theorem [ 10 ] indicates that the lumped reaction of the open complex formation will tend to have a gaussian distribution of waiting times , converging to a @xmath11 function for a very large number of intermediate steps .",
    "thus , in terms of reaction rates ( which have units of inverse time ) we have @xmath12 .    from the above considerations",
    ", it follows that the whole sequence of reactions can be approximated by the following reaction : @xmath13 where @xmath14    let us now analyze the translation process , in which the information initially transcribed into @xmath1 is now translated into proteins @xmath2 . to describe this we consider the following additional reactions : @xmath15",
    "@xmath16 the first reaction idealizes the multistep translation process , under the further idealization that a ribosome ( @xmath3 ) binds the @xmath1 and a protein @xmath2 is produced .",
    "the second reaction captures the degradation of @xmath1 .",
    "the model described here is intentionally as simple as possible .",
    "we believe that such an approach is as important as detailed biological modeling in elucidating the basic physics behind genetic regulatory networks .",
    "the main idea of the model is to replace all regulatory interactions to any one gene with an average or effective interaction which takes into account the repression and activation mechanisms .",
    "let us now consider a system formed from @xmath0 genes . in this system protein",
    "multimers ( which are the transcription factors ) are responsible for gene regulation ( activation and repression ) and are allowed to bind to the promoter site . here ,",
    "an important problem is to specify which reactions are allowed to take place in the system .",
    "we consider that the basic level of expression ( transcrition and translation ) , the @xmath1 and protein degradation reactions always exist , and they represent the minimum set of reactions describing the system .",
    "the existence of the other ( activation , repression and multimerization ) reactions is specified by an associated set of binary coefficients ( switches ) @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "if the value of such a coefficient is @xmath22 then the reaction exists , if the coefficient is @xmath23 then the reaction does not exist .",
    "the possible chemical reactions up to the dimer interaction case are @xmath24 :    - transcription : @xmath25    - @xmath1 degradation @xmath26    - translation : @xmath27    - protein degradation : @xmath28    - protein dimerization : @xmath29 where the coefficients @xmath30 are the selection switches . here , a protein dimer is formed by combining two protein monomers",
    ".    - repression : @xmath31 @xmath32 where the selection is done by setting @xmath33 , @xmath34 . in the first reaction ,",
    "a protein monomer binds to the promoter and the effect is an inhibition of the basic level of transcription reaction , which actually leads to a gene repression .",
    "the existence of the second repression reaction is conditioned by the dimerization reaction between proteins . therefore , the real regulatory coefficient for this reaction is @xmath35",
    ".    - activation : @xmath36 @xmath37 in order to have an activation , a protein monomer or a dimer must first bind to the promoter and form another complex .",
    "therefore , the existence of an activation reaction is conditioned by the coefficients @xmath33 , @xmath38 and @xmath39",
    ". thus , the activation reactions are in fact regulated by @xmath40 , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 , @xmath43",
    ".    we should note that the number of possible reactions is very high .",
    "this number depends on the considered length of possible multimers formed by the transcription factors .",
    "here we have considered only the reactions up to a possible dimer interaction .",
    "however , we will show that these reactions are enough for the purpose of illustrating the interaction mechanism in a more general model , corresponding to higher order multimer interactions .",
    "in a steady state the repression and dimerization reactions are in equilibrium and we have : @xmath44[m_{i } ] & = & \\widetilde{k}_{i}^{n}[p_{n}m_{i } ] , \\\\ k_{ij}^{n}[p_{n}][m_{i}m_{j } ] & = & \\widetilde{k}_{ij}^{n}[p_{n}m_{i}m_{j } ] ,   \\nonumber \\\\ k_{ij}[m_{i}][m_{j } ] & = & \\widetilde{k}_{ij}[m_{i}m_{j } ] .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here by @xmath45 $ ] we understand the concentration of @xmath46 .",
    "one can see that each promoter @xmath47 can be in different states corresponding to the transcription factor complex which binds to it : @xmath48 from the above equations one can see that the probabilities associated to these states are in the ratio : @xmath49}{[p_{n } ] } & = & \\frac{k_{i}^{n}}{\\widetilde{k}_{i}^{n } } [ m_{i}]=a_{i}^{n}x_{i } , \\\\",
    "\\frac{\\lbrack p_{n}m_{i}m_{j}]}{[p_{n } ] } & = & \\frac{k_{ij}^{n}}{\\widetilde{k } _ { ij}^{n}}[m_{i}m_{j}]=\\frac{k_{ij}^{n}}{\\widetilde{k}_{ij}^{n}}\\frac{k_{ij } } { \\widetilde{k}_{ij}}x_{i}x_{j }   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & ( b_{ij}^{n}+b_{ij}^{n})x_{i}x_{j}=2b_{ij}^{n}x_{i}x_{j}.   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 are the reduced concentrations variables for the transcription factors .",
    "the probability that the promoter @xmath47 is in a free state is given by : @xmath51 where the denominator is the sum over all possible states of the promoter including the free state and the binding states .",
    "consequently , the probabilities that the promoter is in a binding state @xmath52 or @xmath53 are : @xmath54 @xmath55 obviously , from the above equations we have : @xmath56 in a steady state , the rate of @xmath57 transcription should be equal to the rate of @xmath57 degradation and therefore we can write the following mean - field equation : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the reduced concentration of @xmath57 . here , we have covered all the system construction possibilities by using the binary coefficients @xmath39 , @xmath33 , @xmath42 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "thus , the transcription of gene @xmath62 , can be approximated using the following nonlinear differential equation : @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "also , @xmath66 is a parameter corresponding to the  promoter strength  ( the ratio between the transcription and the degradation rates ) .    also , in a steady state , the rate of translation should be equal to the rate of protein degradation .",
    "therefore , for the gene @xmath62 , we can write the second equation : @xmath67=\\widetilde{k}_{ii}^{n}[m_{n}],\\ ] ] and consequently the second differential equation : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a coefficient measuring the delay induced by the translation process .",
    "let us give some simple examples to the above equations .",
    "first , let us consider the case of two genes , where all the monomer interactions are excluded and the interaction is mediated only by dimers ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "we consider that the interaction at the dimer level is performed only by homo - dimers ( @xmath71 . also , the interaction is due only to the repression mechanism ( @xmath72 ) , and the repression is performed only by the other gene s homo - dimers ( @xmath73 ) . with these approximations",
    "we obtain the well known toggle switch model [ 15 ] : @xmath74 now , let us consider the case in which three genes are repressing each other at a dimer level in a circular way : @xmath75 this means that : @xmath76 ; @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) ; @xmath72 ; @xmath79 ( @xmath78 and @xmath80 ) . with these assumptions we obtain the well known equations of the repressilator [ 16 ] : @xmath81 the analysis of the repressilator model has shown that in order to obtain sustained oscillations we need strong promoters , which is equivalent to a high rate of expression or a low rate of degradation [ 16 ] .    from the above considerations we observe that the multimer interactions can be represented using a tensorial expansion .",
    "the coefficients describing the interaction can be condensed in tensors of different ranks , corresponding to the length of considered multimers .",
    "thus , in general for a network with @xmath0 genes we can write the following set of equations @xmath82 : @xmath83 one can see that the numerator of the above fraction contains all the activation interactions , while the denominator contains all the repression interactions .",
    "therefore , this intrinsic ratio , between activation and repression , defines the dynamics of the gene network .",
    "in order to simplify further our description we consider that the transcription and translation processes can be condensed in only one reaction : @xmath84 this means that we are neglecting the delay effects introduced by the translation process , which is equivalent to consider @xmath85 .",
    "therefore the dynamics of the system will be described only by the following simplified equations : @xmath86    let us consider the mean - field equations up to the dimer level .",
    "obviously , these equations contain an extremely large number of unknown parameters .",
    "for example , very few rate constants for the constituent reactions have been measured in cells and one is often ignorant of absolute concentrations of the participating molecular species . meanwhile , the ensemble approach [ 17 ] , which consists in sampling random networks from an ensemble of networks built according to the constraints we know that characterize real genomic systems and then analyzing the typical , or generic , properties of ensemble members , remains one useful approach to making use of the information we are gathering on real systems to understand their large scale dynamical and network connectivity implications .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the mean - field model described here has the advantage that all the parameters correspond only to ratios of reaction constant rates , and therefore it does not require the knowledge of absolute values of these constant rates .",
    "this characteristic of the model gives us the chance to simplify even more the sampling of the parameters .",
    "thus , in the spirit of the ensemble approach let us consider that the coefficients @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 are drawn from a gaussian distribution as following : @xmath93 here , @xmath94 is a random variable governed by a gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance equal to one , and @xmath95 . by using this sampling procedure ,",
    "we assume implicitly that the ratios of reaction constant rates are normally distributed around some average values @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 .",
    "also , high values of the parameters controlling the variance ( @xmath101 ) are useful in creating a large spectrum of values around the average values .",
    "for example , because @xmath64 are generated from a gaussian distribution centered at @xmath98 it follows that : @xmath102 or @xmath103 .",
    "this means that for @xmath104 the rate of activation reactions can be higher or lower than the rate corresponding to the basic level of expression . in our simulations",
    "we have used the following parameters : @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 . also , the initial conditions @xmath108 are drawn from an uniform distribution between @xmath23 and @xmath109 .",
    "obviously , one can try a different scenario in which for example all these parameters are drawn from an uniform distribution .",
    "let us now consider the extreme case when all the dimers formed by the transcription factors are missing from the system : @xmath110 because the number of parameters in the system is still very large one can imagine a huge number of numerical experiments .",
    "below we describe a couple of such possible numerical experiments .    in the first experiment , the coefficients regulating the monomer interactions",
    "@xmath111 are generated randomly such that : @xmath112 the numerical results have shown that for any values of @xmath113 and @xmath114 the system converges only to steady states .    in the second experiment , the values of the coefficients regulating the monomer interactions",
    "@xmath111 are generated such that the sums : @xmath115 follow a power law distribution : @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the riemann zeta function .",
    "recent analysis indicates that a power law distribution of interactions seems to fit better the data observed experimentally for several organisms [ 18 - 20 ] .",
    "such a distribution can be obtained from an uniform distribution using the inverse transformation method : @xmath118^ { \\frac{1}{1-\\omega } } .\\ ] ] here , @xmath119 is an uniform distributed random number on the interval @xmath120 $ ] .",
    "the exponent of the power law distribution is @xmath121 ( where @xmath122 is the pareto distribution shape parameter ) .",
    "the above equation returns a value @xmath123 $ ] , distributed accordingly to a power law with the exponent @xmath124 . in our simulation we have set @xmath125 , @xmath126 and the variable parameter is @xmath124 . the rest of the parameters and the initial states are set as before .",
    "the numerical results have shown that for any values @xmath127 the system converges to steady states .",
    "these numerical results suggest that protein multimerization might be a necessary condition to generate more complex dynamics in the system .      by increasing the number of dimers formed by the transcription factors : @xmath128",
    "one can easily see how the complex behavior emerges in the system . depending on the values of the other regulatory parameters , the model exhibits complex oscillatory and chaotic dynamics .",
    "let us now consider the other extreme case when all the dimers formed by the transcription factors are present in the system : @xmath129    the coefficients @xmath111 , @xmath130 , regulating the monomer interactions , are generated randomly as before , with the probabilities @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the other coefficients are determined as following : @xmath131 the rest of the coefficients and the initial conditions are set as before in the numerical experiment for @xmath132 .",
    "the numerical results , have shown that for any values of @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 the system mostly converges to steady states similar to those obtained for @xmath132 , however oscillatory solutions have also been observed .    in the next numerical experiment",
    "we consider that the values of the coefficients regulating the monomer and dimer interactions are generated such that the sums : @xmath135 follows a power law distribution . for @xmath136 and @xmath137",
    "we set @xmath126 , while for @xmath138 and @xmath139 we have @xmath140 .",
    "the rest of the coefficients and the initial conditions are set as before . for small values of @xmath141",
    "the system converges mostly to steady states .",
    "an example of steady state obtained for @xmath142 and @xmath143 is given in fig .",
    "for average values @xmath144 the density of steady states in the solution space decreases , making room for oscillatory solutions . in fig .",
    "1(b ) we give an example of oscillatory solution obtained for @xmath145 . for larger values",
    "@xmath146 one can easily obtain chaotic solutions . in fig .",
    "1(c ) we give an example of chaotic solution obtained for @xmath147 .",
    "the dynamic behavior of solutions was characterized by performing fourier analysis on long trajectories .",
    "the fourier power spectrum is discrete for an oscillatory solution , while in the case of a chaotic solution it shows continuous intervals of frequencies . in fig .",
    "2 we give the typical fourier power spectrum obtained for a single @xmath148 trajectory : ( a ) oscillations ; ( b ) chaos .",
    "the above result suggests that for power law distributed interactions ( up to the dimer level ) , there is a transition between order and chaos when the power law exponent @xmath124 increases . in order to characterize this transition one can try to calculate the largest lyapunov exponent for the dynamical system [ 21 ] . a positive value of the largest lyapunov exponent indicates the chaotic behavior of the system , while a negative value indicates a regular dynamics .",
    "we have performed several calculations for networks with a modest size ( @xmath149 ) just to confirm the chaotic behavior of the solutions .",
    "unfortunately , the computation of the lyapunov exponent is quite intensive and it quickly becomes prohibitive for networks with a very large number of genes , sampled from a huge ensemble of networks ( as described above ) .",
    "therefore , in order to analyze this transition we consider a simplified approach , which focuses on steady state solutions , by calculating the average fluctuations : @xmath150 here , @xmath151 is the length of the trajectory ( the number of time steps , after the transient is eliminated ) and @xmath152 is the time average of @xmath148 . the global quantity @xmath153 measures the fluctuations around the average values @xmath154 .",
    "obviously , @xmath155 can not distinguish between chaotic and oscillatory trajectories , however it provides a simple and efficient discrimination between ordinary steady state solutions ( fig .",
    "1(a ) ) and the oscillatory and chaotic solutions ( fig .",
    "1(b ) , ( c ) ) . for ordinary steady state solutions",
    "@xmath156 , while for oscillatory and chaotic solutions @xmath157 . in fig .",
    "we give the results obtained for @xmath158 by averaging over 100 solutions for @xmath159 $ ] .",
    "the parameter @xmath153 measures the transition between a phase with high density of ordinary steady state solutions and a phase with low density of steady state solutions .",
    "one can see that the transition occurs around @xmath160 .",
    "also , one can see that @xmath161 does not seems to depend on the number of genes in the network @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 .",
    "therefore , the average number of interactions per gene at the critical point in a large network ( @xmath167 ) can be easily estimated as : @xmath168 obviously , by increasing @xmath124 the number of interactions per gene decreases . for large values of @xmath124",
    "the number of interactions approaches @xmath169 .",
    "these results suggest that the network is more stable for low values of @xmath124 , i.e. when the number of interactions per gene is higher than @xmath170 , and it looses stability when @xmath124 increases , i.e. when the number of interactions is low .",
    "we have observed this phenomenon for various values of the system parameters , which suggests that it is an important characteristic of the system .",
    "for @xmath172 the numerical simulation becomes difficult because of the higher order combinatorial explosion in the definition of tensor coefficients .",
    "the number of coefficients for a tensor with rank @xmath2 grows exponentially fast as @xmath173 , where @xmath0 is the number of genes in the network .",
    "therefore , further simplifications are required . here",
    ", we consider a simplified system of @xmath0 genes which has a high level of complexity , comparable with the general mean - field system of equations .",
    "this simplified system has the advantage that it can make the simulations possible even for very large values of @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "we make a further simplification by assuming that @xmath174 this means that the interaction strength at a given multimer level depends slightly on the corresponding tensor rank . with these assumptions",
    "we obtain the following set of equations ( @xmath175 ) : @xmath176    now let us assume that all the higher order multimer interactions ( corresponding to a tensor rank @xmath177 ) are generated from the first order monomer interactions in the following recursive way :    -repression : @xmath178    -activation : @xmath179 for example , the dimer interaction terms are given by :    -repression : @xmath180    -activation : @xmath181 thus , we obtain the following simplified system of differential equations @xmath182 : @xmath183 \\left ( \\frac{a_{n}\\sum\\limits_{i}\\beta _ { i}^{n}x_{i}-1}{c_{n}a_{n}\\sum \\limits_{i}\\gamma _ { i}^{n}\\beta _ { i}^{n}x_{i}-1}\\right ) -x_{n}.\\ ] ] the advantage of this model consists in the fact that at each iteration step , in the algorithm used to solve the system of differential equations , one has to calculate only the first rank interaction tensors , @xmath184 and @xmath185 , even though the expansion is considered up to the maximum rank @xmath2 .",
    "we have performed a numerical experiment in which all the parameters and the initial states are set as before for @xmath186 .",
    "also , the coefficients regulating the monomer interactions @xmath187 , @xmath130 are generated using the probabilities @xmath113 , @xmath114 , as in the first numerical experiment , performed for @xmath132 .",
    "thus , the variable parameters are @xmath113 , @xmath114 and the maximum rank @xmath2 of tensorial expansion ( which corresponds to the maximum length of multimers mediating the interaction among genes ) .",
    "depending on the values of all these parameters , the system exhibits different types of behavior .",
    "however , the most important parameter seems to be @xmath2 . for low values @xmath188",
    "the density of steady states in the solution space is very high and therefore the system converges most of the time to a steady state ( fig .",
    "4 ( a ) ) . by increasing @xmath2 to @xmath189 the density of steady states decreases and",
    "the typical behavior becomes oscillatory ( fig . 4 ( b ) ) .",
    "for larger values of @xmath190 , the dynamics becomes more complex , exhibiting chaotic behavior ( fig .",
    "4 ( c ) ) . the numerical results for",
    "this experiment show that there is a smooth transition between order and chaos as the parameter @xmath2 increases .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that by increasing @xmath2 one actually increases the cooperativity among the transcription factors and implicitly the nonlinearity of the system .",
    "we have discussed a mean - field model of genetic regulatory networks , in which the regulatory interactions are described by differential equations corresponding to the chemical equations considered in the network .",
    "we have shown that , depending on the set of regulatory parameters , the model exhibits differing behaviors corresponding to ordered and chaotic dynamics .",
    "this result gives some quantitative support to the earlier qualitative results obtained for random boolean networks [ 2 - 6 ] .",
    "however , contrary to boolean networks , by increasing the number of interactions per gene , our model acquires stability .",
    "this is an important issue which we would like to address here and in the future .",
    "we believe that the stability of the system occurs from the intrinsic construction of the activation / repression ratio .",
    "this ratio corresponds to an average interaction , which takes into account all the repression and activation mechanisms acting on any one gene in the network .",
    "also , according to the central limit theorem , the variance of the sums , defining the numerator and denominator of this ratio , decreases by considering more terms ( interactions ) .",
    "these mechanisms create stability in the system by producing a contraction which keeps the solution bounded .",
    "so , by increasing the number of interactions , the system becomes more stable . for specific sets of parameters",
    "the solution is not only bounded but it also corresponds to ordered dynamics ( steady states or oscillations ) . by changing the set of parameters ,",
    "this contraction becomes loose enough that the solution becomes chaotic . in this case",
    "the system becomes ergodic and it is able to explore large regions in the solution space .",
    "an important role in generating oscillatory and chaotic dynamics is played by the length of transcription factor multimers mediating the interaction among genes .",
    "our analysis has shown that protein multimerization is a necessary condition for the discussed mean - field model to generate oscillatory and chaotic dynamics .    in summary , we have introduced and provided an initial analysis of a mean - field model for a class of reasonably realistic chemical equations modeling genetic regulatory networks . we presume a critical phase transition occurs as the system goes from order to chaos .",
    "this is important because recent evidence tentatively suggests that yeast cells are critical [ 23 ] .",
    "indeed , it has been a long standing hypothesis that cells are critical or slightly subcritical to withstand noise [ 24 ] .",
    "thus , our results give preliminary support to this hypothesis .",
    "it remains for future work to explore in more detail how networks with diverse topologies but similar kinetics behave .",
    "if it proves true that biological cells are critical or near critical , our model should be of use in exploring the combinations of network topologies , motifs and kinetic rules that can correspond to such critical behavior .",

    "<S> in this paper , we propose a mean - field model which attempts to bridge the gap between random boolean networks and more realistic stochastic modeling of genetic regulatory networks . </S>",
    "<S> the main idea of the model is to replace all regulatory interactions to any one gene with an average or effective interaction , which takes into account the repression and activation mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> we find that depending on the set of regulatory parameters , the model exhibits rich nonlinear dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the model also provides quantitative support to the earlier qualitative results obtained for random boolean networks .    * </S>",
