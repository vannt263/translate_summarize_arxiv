    "the classical risk model and the renewal risk model are two models that are traditionally used to describe the nonlife insurance business .",
    "the classical risk model was introduced by lundberg and cramr about a century ago ( see @xcite for the source papers and @xcite for the historical environment ) . in this risk model",
    ", it is assumed that interarrival times are identically distributed , exponential , and independent random variables . in 1957 , the danish mathematician e. sparre andersen proposed the renewal risk model to describe the surplus process of the insurance company . in the renewal risk model ,",
    "the claim sizes and the interarrival times are independent , identically distributed , nonnegative random variables ( see @xcite for the source paper and @xcite for additional details ) . in this paper , we assume that interoccurrence times and claim sizes are nonnegative random variables ( r.v.s ) that are not necessarily identically distributed .",
    "we call such a model the inhomogeneous model and present its exact definition .",
    "it is evident that the inhomogeneous renewal risk model reflects better the real insurance activities in comparison with the classical risk model or with the renewal ( homogeneous ) risk model .",
    "[ dd ] we say that the insurer s surplus @xmath0 varies according to the inhomogeneous renewal risk model if @xmath1 for all @xmath2 . here :    * @xmath3 is the initial reserve ; * claim sizes @xmath4 form a sequence of independent ( not necessarily identically distributed ) nonnegative r.v.s ; * @xmath5 is the constant premium rate ; * @xmath6 is the number of claims in the interval @xmath7 $ ] , where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and the interarrival times @xmath11 are independent ( not necessarily identically distributed ) , nonnegative , and nondegenerate at zero r.v.s ; * the sequences @xmath12 and @xmath13 are mutually independent .    a typical path of the surplus process of an insurance company is shown in fig . [ f01 ] .",
    "if all claim sizes @xmath14 and all interarrival times @xmath15 are identically distributed , then the inhomogeneous renewal risk model becomes the homogeneous renewal risk model .",
    "the _ time of ruin _ and _ the ruin probability _ are the main critical characteristics of any risk model .",
    "let @xmath16 denote the event of ruin .",
    "we suppose that @xmath17 that is , that ruin occurs if at some time @xmath2 the surplus of the insurance company becomes negative or , in other words , the insurer becomes unable to pay all the claims .",
    "the first time @xmath18 when the surplus drops to a level less than zero is called _ the time of ruin _ , that is , @xmath18 is the extended r.v .  for which @xmath19    _ the ruin probability _",
    "@xmath20 is defined by the equality @xmath21 usually , we suppose that the main parameter of the ruin probability is the initial reserve @xmath22 , though actually the ruin probability , together with time of ruin , depends on all components of the renewal risk model .",
    "all trajectories of the process @xmath0 are increasing functions between times @xmath23 and @xmath24 for all @xmath25 . therefore , the random variables @xmath26 , @xmath27 , are the local minimums of the trajectories .",
    "consequently , we can express the ruin probability in the following way ( for details , see @xcite or @xcite ) : @xmath28    further , in this paper , we restrict our study to the so - called _ lundberg - type inequality_. an exponential bound for the ruin probability is usually called a   lundberg - type inequality",
    ". we further give the well - known exponential bound for @xmath29 in homogeneous renewal risk model ( see , for instance , chapters ",
    "lundberg inequality for ruin probability `` collective risk theoryadjustment coefficient , '' or `` cramer  lundberg asymptotics '' in @xcite ) .",
    "let the net profit condition @xmath30 hold , and let for some @xmath31 in the homogeneous renewal risk model .",
    "then , there is a number @xmath32 such that @xmath33 for all @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath34 for some positive @xmath35 , then we can take @xmath36 in .=-1    there exist a lot of different proofs of this theorem . the main ways to prove inequality",
    "are described in chapter `` lundberg inequality for ruin probability '' of @xcite .",
    "details of some existing proofs were given , for instance , by asmussen and albrecher @xcite , embrechts , klppelberg , and mikosch @xcite , embrechts and veraverbeke  @xcite , gerber @xcite , and mikosch @xcite .",
    "we note only that the bound can be proved using the exponential tail bound of sgibnev  @xcite and the inequality @xmath37 .",
    "the following theorem is the main statement of the paper .",
    "[ t ] let the claim sizes @xmath4 and the interarrival times @xmath38 form an inhomogeneous renewal risk model described in definition [ dd ] .",
    "further , let the following three conditions be satisfied : @xmath39 then , there are constants @xmath40 and @xmath41 such that @xmath42 for all @xmath43 .",
    "the inhomogeneous renewal risk model differs from the homogeneous one because the independence and/or homogeneous distribution of sequences of random variables @xmath44 and/or @xmath45 are no longer required .",
    "the changes depend on how the inhomogeneity in a particular model is understood . in definition [ dd ] ,",
    "we have chosen one of two possible directions used in numerous articles that deal with inhomogeneous renewal risk models .",
    "this is due to the fact that an inhomogeneity can be considered as the possibility to have either differently distributed or dependent r.v.s in the sequences .",
    "the possibility to have differently distributed r.v.s was considered , for instance , in @xcite . in the first three works , the discrete - time inhomogeneous risk model was considered . in such a model ,",
    "the interarrival times are fixed , and the claims @xmath44 are independent , not necessary identically distributed , integer valued r.v.s . in @xcite , the authors consider the model where the interarrival times are identically distributed and have a particular distribution , whereas the claims are differently distributed with distributions belonging to a particular class .",
    "bernackait and iaulys @xcite deal with an inhomogeneous renewal risk model where the r.v.s @xmath46 are not necessarily identically distributed , but the claim sizes @xmath44 have a common distribution function . in this article",
    ", we consider a more general renewal risk model . in the main theorem",
    ", we assume that not only r.v.s @xmath46 are not necessarily identically distributed , but also the same holds for the sequence of claim sizes @xmath44 .",
    "there is another approach to inhomogeneous renewal risk models , which implies the possibility to have dependence in sequences and mainly found in works by chinese researchers . in this kind of models , the sequences",
    "@xmath44 and @xmath47 consist of identically distributed r.v.s , but there may be some kind of dependence between them",
    ". results for such models can be found , for instance , in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "another interpretation of dependence is also possible , where r.v.s in both sequences @xmath44 and @xmath47 still remain independent . instead of that , the mutual independence of these two sequences is no longer required .",
    "the idea of this kind of dependence belongs to albrecher and teugels @xcite , and this encouraged li , tang , and wu @xcite to study renewal risk models having this dependence structure .",
    "the rest of the paper consists of two sections . in section",
    "[ au ] , we formulate and prove an auxiliary lemma . the proof of the main theorem is presented in section [ pa ] .",
    "in order to prove the main theorem , we need an auxiliary lemma . in lemma",
