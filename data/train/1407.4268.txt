    "the m2-brane worldvolume theory on the flat spacetime was explored by supersymmetrizing the topological chern - simons theory @xcite and finally it was proposed @xcite that the worldvolume theory of @xmath7 m2-branes on the geometry @xmath11 is described by @xmath12 supersymmetric chern - simons theory with gauge group @xmath13 and bifundamental matters between them , which is dubbed abjm theory . here",
    "the subscript @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the chern - simons levels associated to each @xmath16 factor .",
    "following recent progress of localization techniques @xcite , it was found that for the partition function and vacuum expectation values of supersymmetric quantities in the abjm theory , the infinite - dimensional path integral in defining these quantities is reduced to a finite - dimensional matrix integration .",
    "furthermore , due to the large supersymmetries , many interesting properties of this abjm matrix model are discovered @xcite : the perturbative part of the partition function sums up to the airy function @xcite ; the divergences in the coefficients of membrane instantons and those of worldsheet instantons cancel among themselves @xcite ; the non - perturbative part of the partition function is expressed in terms of the refined topological string @xcite .",
    "here we briefly review these results on the partition function of the abjm theory .",
    "first let us consider the perturbative part . with the t hooft coupling @xmath17 fixed from the stringy regime or with the m - theory background @xmath14 fixed from the m - theory regime .",
    "the perturbation can be understood in either sense .",
    "] it was predicted from the gravity dual that the t hooft coupling @xmath17 should be shifted as @xmath18 @xcite and ( except an inconsistency in the coefficient of the @xmath19 correction ) this shift was captured from the study of the matrix model @xcite . with the shift of the t hooft coupling in mind , the all genus perturbative corrections of the partition function sum up to the airy function @xcite @xmath20 , \\label{ai}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the relation with the topological string theory on local @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "this result was later beautifully rederived @xcite by rewriting the abjm partition function into the partition function of a fermi gas system , without mentioning the relation with the topological string . here",
    "the @xmath7-independent constants @xmath2 and @xmath3 are given by simple functions of @xmath14 @xmath22 while @xmath4 is a very complicated function @xmath23 which was obtained by taking the borel sum of the constant map contribution @xcite .",
    "the non - perturbative effects have a more drastic structure .",
    "it turns out that there are two types of non - perturbative effects .",
    "one is called worldsheet instanton @xcite which corresponds to the string worldsheet wrapping the holomorphic cycle @xmath24 in @xmath25 , while the other is called membrane instanton @xcite which corresponds to the d2-brane wrapping the lagrangian submanifold @xmath26 of @xmath25 , where @xmath25 comes from the string theory limit @xmath27 of @xmath28 .",
    "it was found @xcite that the coefficients of both instanton effects are actually divergent at certain levels @xmath14 , though the divergences are cancelled perfectly , if we include all of the non - perturbative effects including worldsheet instantons , membrane instantons and their bound states .",

    "it is interesting to ask whether the beautiful structures in the abjm theory persist in other theories . before arriving at the abjm theory ,",
    "a large class of supersymmetric chern - simons theories were found . for @xmath29 ,",
    "the supersymmetric chern - simons theories are constructed @xcite for general gauge groups and general matter contents .",
    "especially , the theory has the conformal symmetry when the gauge group is @xmath30 with @xmath31 and the matter fields are in the bifundamental representation of @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "these theories can be expressed by a circular quiver taking the same form as the dynkin diagram of @xmath34 , where each vertex denotes the @xmath16 factor of the gauge group and each edge denotes the bifundamental matter . the chern - simons theory with less supersymmetries",
    "is believed to describe the worldvolume theory of multiple m2-branes on a geometry with less supersymmetries .",
    "it was found that among others when the number of the @xmath16 factors is even and the levels are @xmath14 and @xmath15 appearing alternatively , the number of the supersymmetries is enhanced to @xmath0 @xcite and the background geometry is interpreted to be an orbifold @xcite . as pointed out in @xcite , the @xmath0 enhancement is not restricted to the case of alternating levels .",
    "in fact , as long as the levels are expressed as @xmath35 the supersymmetry of all these theories extends to @xmath0 .",
    "since these theories are characterized by @xmath36 which are associated to the edges of the quivers and take only two signs , it is more suitable to assign two colors to the edges , rather than to paint the vertices . see figure [ n4quiver ] .    , which is associated to the @xmath0 superconformal chern - simons theories .",

    "we would like to understand this effect better . along the line of the interpretation in the gravity",
    "dual , it is very interesting to note that the coefficient of the one - loop log term was studied from the gravity side @xcite and the match with the expansion of the airy function was found .",
