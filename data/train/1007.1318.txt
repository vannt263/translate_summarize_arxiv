    "we study the jet kinematics and jet ridge line evolution of the caltech - jodrell bank flat - spectrum ( cjf ) sample .",
    "the sample consists of 293 radio - loud active galaxies @xcite , spanning a large redshift range ( @xmath1 ; @xmath2 ) .",
    "each source has at least 3 epochs of radio interferometric ( vlba ) observations and has been imaged and studied kinematically @xcite .",
    "we correlate the kinematic information @xcite with the @xmath4-ray properties of the sample . in total 25 sources",
    "have been detected in @xmath4-rays .",
    "18 cjf sources are included in the 3 month bright agn source list of the fermi - lat @xcite , with 7 additional sources detected by egret @xcite .",
    "the maximum of the apparent speed distribution for the @xmath4-ray non - detected sources is @xmath5 . for the detected sources the distribution shows two maxima ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) .",
    "the detected sources dominate the high speed tail of the total distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma_speeds ] ) .",
    "we define the ridge line of a jet as the line that linearly connects all component positions at a given epoch .",
    "we build the jet ridge lines for all cjf sources ( for s5 1803 + 784 , see britzen et al .",
    "2009 , a&a , in press ) and study their properties and evolution across all available epochs .",
    "we define the angle between the innermost jet component and the core , @xmath8 , as the approximate ejection angle of the jet ( the core being at the beginning of the coordinates system ) .",
    "we study the change of this angle across all available epochs .",
    "most sources exhibit a maximum ejection angle change @xmath9 .",
    "5.1% of the sources show ejection angle changes @xmath10 , with two sources at @xmath11 .",
    "we quantify the jet ridge line evolution as the total component position change across all epochs . @xmath4-ray",
    "variable sources show stronger ridge line evolution than non - variable ones .",
    "sources with stronger ridge line evolution tend to be more luminous in the @xmath4-rays .",
    "we find that @xmath4-ray detected sources show higher apparent speeds than non - detected ones .",
    "@xmath4-variable sources show stronger jet ridge line evolution .",
    "@xmath12 show considerable jet ejection angle changes ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "such jet ejection angle changes might be connected to precessing or helical jets .",
