    "ambipolar diffusion is the joint drift of charged particles and the associated magnetic flux with respect to the neutral particles in a partially ionized plasma . @xcite",
    "first proposed it in order to explain the loss of magnetic flux from the dense cores of molecular clouds , required for the formation of stars , starting an active field of research in this area .",
    "later , it was suggested to also play a role in the decay of the magnetic fields of neutron stars ( @xcite , hereafter gr-92 ) which became particularly relevant with the identification of `` magnetars '' , neutron stars whose main power source appears to be the dissipation of their magnetic field @xcite .    in a previous paper ( @xcite ; hereafter paper i ) , we established a multifluid formalism in which it is possible to study the long - term evolution of magnetic fields in neutron stars ( see @xcite for a discussion of the main properties of the magnetic field equilibria and their subsequent long - term evolution ) . in that work , and following the ideas developed by gr-92 , we included the effects of several physical processes that are also relevant for star formation and protoplanetary disks , including _",
    "ambipolar diffusion _ , _ hall drift _",
    "( non - dissipative advection of the magnetic field by the associated electrical current ) , and _ ohmic diffusion _ ( dissipation of currents through the electrical resistivity ) .",
    "here we continue this study and concentrate our analysis on the long - term evolution of the magnetic field caused by ambipolar diffusion aided by beta decays .",
    "following the same philosophy of paper i , and as a first approach to the understanding of our general formalism , we focus on a simplified , one - dimensional configuration in which the magnetic field points in one cartesian direction @xmath0 but varies only along an orthogonal direction @xmath1 , i.  e. , @xmath2 .",
    "such models have also been considered in several studies of ambipolar diffusion in the interstellar medium @xcite , although some of the assumptions differ from case to case . in our analysis",
    ", we consider separately two relevant limits , similar in spirit , though not exactly equivalent to those of @xcite :    * in the _ weak coupling _",
    "limit , there are few collisions between the particles , and the beta decays proceed slowly .",
    "therefore , the particles can reach the diffusive equilibrium easily , but it takes much longer to reach the chemical equilibrium . * in the _ strong coupling _",
    "limit , there are many collisions between the particles , and the beta decays proceed fast , so the ( local ) chemical equilibrium is reached much more quickly than the diffusive equilibrium .    for each of these cases , we find that the long - term evolution of the magnetic field can be modelled by a single equation that gives the time - derivative @xmath3 at a given instant @xmath4 only in terms of the configuration of the magnetic field at the same instant , @xmath5 .",
    "this makes it easy to carry out numerical simulations of the evolution of some selected non - linear magnetic field profiles , and even find some exact , analytical solutions .    in sect .",
    "[ 1dmodel ] of this paper , we briefly review the one - dimensional model of neutron star magnetic field evolution introduced in paper i , paying particular attention to its characteristic evolutionary time - scales .    in sects .",
    "[ asy1 ] and [ asy2 ] , we obtain the equations for the long - term , asymptotic magnetic field evolution promoted by ambipolar diffusion in each of the two opposite regimes mentioned above , and we make numerical simulations of the evolution of different initial magnetic field configurations .",
    "we show that , in both cases , the magnetic flux of a given sign tends to spread out , but singularities develop at the null points where regions with different signs meet , as previously found by @xcite . in the weak coupling case , these singularities correspond to current sheets that are dissipated by resistive effects , in this way leading to reconnection . in the strong coupling case ,",
    "the singularities have a somewhat different character ( a smoothly diverging current density ) and might lead directly to reconnection even in the case of no ohmic resistivity ( but see @xcite ) . finally , in sect .  [ conc ] ,",
    "we give the main conclusions of our study .",
    "we model the neutron star interior as an electrically neutral and slightly ionized plasma composed of three mobile , strongly degenerate , particle species : neutrons @xmath6 , protons @xmath7 , and electrons @xmath8 .",
    "we account for binary collisions and weak interactions ( causing nuclear beta decays ) between the particles , and allow for strong interactions between neutrons and protons by writing each of their chemical potentials as a function of both of their number densities : @xmath9 , while considering the electrons as an ideal , relativistic fermi gas , whose chemical potential is a function only of their number density , @xmath10 .",
    "we study a one - dimensional geometry in which the magnetic field points in one cartesian direction @xmath0 , but varies only along an orthogonal direction @xmath1 as @xmath11 , and assume that all physical variables vary only along @xmath1 . since , in neutron star conditions , the ratio of the magnetic pressure @xmath12 to the pressure of the charged particles is very small , the magnetic force causes only small perturbations to the hydrostatic equilibrium state of the non - magnetized star",
    ".    these assumptions are generally not true in molecular cloud cores , where the ionization fraction tends to be extremely low , whereas the magnetic field can be near equipartition with the neutral gas pressure . in this sense",
    ", our derivation will be valid only for the case of neutron stars , although we will see that some of the results agree with those of other authors , obtained under somewhat different assumptions .",
    "a more general treatment appears to be difficult and not to yield simple results .    for the reasons stated",
    ", we consider a non - magnetized , fixed background system in hydrostatic and chemical equilibrium and introduce small perturbations to the number density of each species @xmath13 as @xmath14 , with the subscript zero labelling the background number densities and @xmath15 .",
    "the associated chemical potential perturbations are given by @xmath16 .",
    "the long - term magnetic field evolution implies small particle velocities that change over long time - scales , much longer than the very short dynamical times that are only relevant shortly after the formation of the star ( i.e , sound or alfvn time - scales ) .",
    "therefore , at all times we use a slow - motion approximation in which we neglect the acceleration terms in the equations of motion for the particles .",
    "taking account of all these considerations , the system of non - linear partial differential equations governing the evolution is ( see paper i for the derivation ) @xmath17",

    "( [ bz ] ) , where @xmath22 denotes the velocity of the charged particles ( the same for electrons and protons ) , @xmath23 is the velocity of the neutrons , and @xmath24 is the ambipolar diffusion velocity .- components of the respective velocities , which cause changes in the distributions of particles and magnetic flux .",
    "the charged - particle velocities must also have a @xmath25-component , responsible for the current that acts as the source of the magnetic field . ] the first term on the right - hand side of this equation causes an advection of the magnetic flux with a velocity @xmath22 , while the second term describes the ohmic diffusion of the field , where @xmath26 is the electrical conductivity . in neutron star core conditions , the electrical conductivity is @xmath27 , thus , the evolution of the large - scale magnetic field through ohmic diffusion proceeds very slowly , with a time - scale @xmath28 , longer than the age of the universe @xcite .",
    "qualitatively similar conditions hold in essentially all astrophysical settings .",
    "therefore , in the rest of this paper , we neglect the ohmic term in the magnetic field evolution equation and focus only on the magnetic evolution due to the advective term .",
    "however , the time - scale for ohmic diffusion scales with the square of the characteristic length of the magnetic field variations ( see paper i ) , thus , the influence of ohmic dissipation can be important in regions with strong spatial magnetic field variations .",
    "the evolution of the particle number density perturbations , for the different species , is given by eqs .",
    "( [ nb ] ) and ( [ nc ] ) , where @xmath29 is the perturbation of the charged particle number density keeping charge neutrality and @xmath30 is the perturbation of the baryon number density .",
    "weak interactions cause beta decays ( conversion of charged particles into neutrons and the opposite ) that tend to reduce deviations from the _ chemical equilibrium _ state between charged particles and neutrons , with a net rate coefficient @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the chemical equilibrium is achieved when @xmath33 .",
    "continuing our description , eq .",
    "( [ va ] ) shows that the ambipolar diffusion velocity @xmath34 is controlled by the collision rate between the charged particles and neutrons , which is proportional to the parametre @xmath35 .",
    "this velocity is driven by the lorentz force but choked by the charged particle pressure gradient it produces @xcite .    regarding the neutrons , we see from the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ vn ] ) that they move with a velocity @xmath23 as long as the system is not in a state of _ magneto - hydrostatic equilibrium_. in this state , the lorentz force is balanced by the pressure gradients of all the particles ( charged particles and neutrons ) .",
    "we also see that the neutron velocity is controlled by the parametre @xmath36 , whose meaning we explain in the next paragraph .",
    "since we are interested in a numerical solution of our equations , we have to take into account that modelling the true dynamical time - scales ( sound or alfvn time - scales of milliseconds to seconds ) would require a time step many orders of magnitude shorter than that required to simulate the long - term evolution , making the simulation computationally unfeasible . for this reason , in paper i we introduced a _",
    "slow - motion approximation _ , neglecting the acceleration terms and instead introducing a small , artificial , friction - like force acting on the neutrons ( the most abundant species ) of the form @xmath37 , where the parametre @xmath36 is chosen in such a way that the time to reach magneto - hydrostatic equilibrium is long enough for the numerical code to be able to deal with it ( and therefore , much longer than the real dynamical times ) , but shorter than the long time - scales over which the magnetic field evolves .",
    "we showed in paper i that the latter time - scales , which are the astrophysically interesting ones , are unaffected by the choice of @xmath36 .",
    "we require the conservation of both the magnetic flux @xmath38 and the baryon number perturbation @xmath39 during the evolution of our system , which spans the segment @xmath40 .",

    "( [ bz]-[nc ] ) describes the evolution of three coupled variables : the magnetic field , the charged particle density perturbation , and the baryon density perturbation . in paper",
    "i , we estimated the three associated characteristic evolutionary time - scales of this set of equations corresponding to exponentially decaying eigenmodes in the linear approximation and showed that they characterize the approach to three successive equilibrium states . here",
    "we briefly describe the evolutionary stages and summarize the relevant time - scales with the main goal of establishing the basic ideas that will be used in our subsequent analysis ( see paper i for more details about their derivation ) .",
    "the shortest time corresponds to the approach of the magneto - hydrostatic equilibrium , controlled by @xmath36 in our model , as already explained .    in a longer time , two alternative processes compete :    1 .",
    "the particle species move relative to each other , controlled by the inter - particle collisions , in a tendency to reach a diffusive equilibrium state in which the fluid forces acting on each species separately are balanced .",
    "the weak interactions convert particles from one species into another , tending towards a chemical equilibrium state .    if the relative motion of charged and neutral particles proceeds much faster than the conversion from one into another , a diffusive equilibrium is achieved in the system , characterized by the balance equations @xmath44 and @xmath45 the inter - particle collision frequency controls the time - scale to reach the diffusive equilibrium , which is given by paper i , @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "if the beta decays are much faster , the chemical equilibrium state @xmath49 is reached in a time - scale controlled by the beta decay rate , @xmath50    thus , we have two relevant limits :    1 .   in the _ weak coupling limit _ , @xmath51 and the weak interactions operate slowly , therefore , the system relaxes to a diffusive equilibrium in a time - scale @xmath52 , but remains out of chemical equilibrium .",
    "2 .   in the opposite , _ strong coupling limit",
    "_ , @xmath53 , the inter - particle collisions are very frequent which impedes a fast achievement of the diffusive equilibrium , while the system can relax to the chemical equilibrium in the time - scale @xmath54 .",
    "the transition between these limits is achieved when @xmath55 .",
    "from eqs .",
    "( [ tnccgen ] ) and ( [ dmu1gen ] ) we infer that the condition for this transition is @xmath56 , which gives @xmath57 .",
    "since the density perturbations are assumed to be small , these will not involve large motions of the particles , and therefore not cause a substantial change in the magnetic flux distribution .",
    "note , however , that these two equilibria are incompatible with each other as long as a spatially non - uniform magnetic field is present , therefore a full equilibrium will only be reached in a much longer time - scale , on which the magnetic field is made uniform ( in our model ) or expelled from the system ( likely more realistic in a true astrophysical setting ) . for the determination of this much longer time - scale , on which the magnetic field does evolve substantially , we again consider the two opposite regimes discussed above . in the _ weak coupling limit _ , the system reached the diffusive equilibrium but not the chemical equilibrium , during the previous stage . during this much longer stage , the weak interactions slowly convert charged particles into neutrons in a tendency to reduce the charged - particle pressure gradient that counterbalances the magnetic pressure gradient .",
    "this causes a slight deviation from the diffusive equilibrium , producing a joint transport of the charged particles and the magnetic flux at a small ambipolar diffusion velocity @xmath34 , always keeping the system very close to diffusive equilibrium .",
    "this interplay continues until both the pressure and magnetic field gradients dissapear , which occurs in a long time - scale that depends on the magnetic field strength and the weak interaction rate :    @xmath58    with @xmath59 , which is roughly the ratio of the charged particle pressure to the magnetic pressure and we defined @xmath60 .    in the _ strong coupling limit _",
    ", the relative motion of the charged particles and neutrons is strongly suppressed by the inter - particle collisions , which delay the diffusive equilibrium state , while in comparison the chemical equilibrium is reached quickly .",
    "the deviation from diffusive equilibrium promotes , as before , a joint motion of the charged particles and the magnetic flux , with a very small ambipolar diffusion velocity @xmath34 .",
    "this movement yields the diffusive equilibrium in a very lon time - scale controlled by the collision rate between particles and by the magnetic - field amplitude , @xmath61    note that at the transition between the strong and weak coupling limits ( @xmath56 ) , the ambipolar diffusion timescales are of the same order : @xmath62 this value corresponds to the shortest possible ambipolar diffusion time , since the relevant timescales increase both towards higher and lower temperatures . although the hall effect is not present in our one - dimensional calculations , it is important to asses its potential importance relative to ambipolar diffusion . consider its timescale , :    @xmath63    compared to the minimum ambipolar diffusion timescale estimated above .",
    "we find that , if @xmath64 , the hall drift is likely to play a dominant role .",
    "it might not be important in magnetars , where @xmath65 , except possibly in reconnection layers , where @xmath66 .",
    "in the present paper , we are interested in the details of the evolution of the magnetic field in the strong and weak coupling limits .",
    "therefore , in the next sections we will obtain the differential equations modelling the evolution of the magnetic field in the time - scales given by eqs .",
    "( [ tbp2 ] ) and ( [ tambi22p2 ] ) .",
    "in this section , we derive a single integro - differential equation that models the magnetic field evolution in the _ weak coupling limit _ ( @xmath51 ) , in which neutral and charged particles drift easily with respect to each other , and the main bottleneck is the ( slow ) rate at which they can be converted into each other , in order to decrease the charged - particle pressure gradients that balance the lorentz force , impeding the magnetic flux to spread .",
    "this limit is not likely to be relevant in the interstellar medium @xcite , although it roughly corresponds to one of the limits considered by @xcite . in neutron stars ,",

    "neutron stars in their hot , early phase will also be in the strong - coupling regime , and evolve to the weak coupling regime as they cool .    in the _ weak coupling limit _",

    "we made numerical simulations of the evolution of different initial magnetic field profiles in each of these limits and found agreement between our numerical results and some analytic solutions that can be found for these differential equations .    from our results , we infer that , in both limits , the ambipolar diffusion process operates in a tendency to spread out the magnetic flux , but contrary to the normal ohmic diffusion this process asymptotically produces singular points with sharp magnetic field gradients .",
    "these sharp gradients develop around those points where the magnetic field is null , and separate regions of magnetic fields with opposite signs .",
    "we observe some generic properties of this process , as follows :    in the _ weak coupling limit _ , the resulting discontinuities can be modelled as step solutions [ eqs .",

    "the asymptotic magnetic field is spatially uniform in each of the regions separated by these singularities , and its absolute value ( and thus the magnetic pressure ) is the same in each region .",
    "ambipolar diffusion by itself does not cause magnetic flux transfer ( and thus reconnection ) across the singularities , but the associated current sheets will easily be dissipated by ohmic diffusion , so reconnection will occur in a realistic system . in the _ strong coupling limit _",
    ", at the singular points the magnetic field vanishes continuously but with infinite spatial derivative .",
    "ambipolar diffusion acts in a tendency to spread out the magnetic flux , but , contrary to the weak coupling limit , the magnetic flux is not preserved in each one of the regions separated by the magnetic null points .",
    "therefore , there is a transfer of magnetic flux through these null points , i.  e. reconnection without ohmic resistivity ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "the main limitation in applying the present formalism to realistic systems ( either neutron stars or molecular cloud cores ) is the very restrictive , one - dimensional geometry .",
