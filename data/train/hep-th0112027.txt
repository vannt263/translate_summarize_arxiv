    "noncommutativity has been studied extensively since it has become clear that noncommutative gauge theories can describe the low energy effective action of a brane in a constant magnetic background ( see @xcite for reviews ) . in particular in @xcite , a correspondence ,",
    "known as the seiberg - witten map , between gauge fields living on d - brane worldvolume in the background of a non vanishing constant electromagnetic field and noncommutative gauge theory on a space with coordinate @xmath2 satisfying @xmath3 = i \\theta^{\\mu\\nu}\\ ] ] has been established .",
    "+ the simplest example of noncommutative gauge theory is the abelian u(1 ) , which is not a free theory , and is more similar to a u(@xmath4 ) gauge theory .",
    "in fact , at least on a torus , there exists a transformation , the morita equivalence , that allows to change the noncommutativity parameter of the space and the rank of the gauge group at the same time .",
    "for example on a 2-torus , u(1 ) with noncommutativity parameter @xmath5 is equivalent to an ordinary u(@xmath4 ) theory . in this context",
    ", morita equivalence can be seen from rewriting the objects in a matrix language @xcite .",
    "+ the action of seiberg - witten ( sw ) map and morita equivalence could be combined , for example , to link the usual abelian born - infeld action to its non - abelian version @xcite , for which the ambiguities have not yet been solved @xcite . in this process , morita equivalence brings all these ordering ambiguities back into the noncommutative world , where we know that the dbi lagrangian is the lagrangian invariant under sw map , in the slowly varying fields limit . fixing the ambiguities requires going beyond this limit , which means also having a better knowledge and understanding of the sw map . +",
    "another related issue is about the dynamics of the @xmath6 field .",
    "for instance , if we take two snapshots of a u(1 ) theory , with two different @xmath6 fields , they would correspond to two different noncommutativity parameters .",
    "let us say that the first one is linked to an ordinary u(5 ) gauge group by morita equivalence , while the second one is related to u(3 ) .",
    "would that mean that the rank of the gauge group itself has become dynamic  ?",
    "we believe that there are still things to be understood in the case of a constant @xmath0 , that could help dealing with a dynamic background .",
    "+ in this paper , we would like to explore further the order by order formulation of the seiberg - witten map , and the structures associated with it . there",
    "already exists a formula , known as liu s conjecture @xcite , recently proven in @xcite , which expresses the commutative field strength for a u(1 ) gauge group in terms of the noncommutative variables non perturbatively .",
    "this formula was found by considering the couplings of the noncommutative brane to ramond - ramond potentials , and its order by order expansion involves the @xmath7 products @xcite . + our approach here is completely different .",
    "it is based on solving order by order the seiberg - witten equation , and is closer in spirit to @xcite .",
    "using the freedom in the possible solutions ( see @xcite ) we have also chosen expressions that differ from those of @xcite by a gauge transformation .",
    "the hope was to express the map in a simpler way , by extending the recursive formulation that appears in the usual first orders of the field strength ( see [ sbs : abfs ] ) .",
    "our guiding criterion for choosing a solution is to preserve its structure at all orders .",
    "hence , our expressions , if still order by order , can be expressed recursively and explicitly written at any order with little work , at least in the abelian case .",
    "hopefully , these recursive expressions will lead to the full non perturbative formula , as in the case of the pure gauge , where we were able to express the solution in a particularly suggestive form .",
    "of course , what is interesting in the pure gauge case is not finding a solution but rather a clue on the particular form of the general solution .",
    "+ the structure of the paper is as follows : definitions and notations will be found in section 2 , as well as some remarks about our method .",
    "section 3 contains the results for an abelian gauge theory , and the order by order solutions are expressed recursively .",
    "this is the main perturbative feature of the paper , and has been explicitly checked up to order 6 ( cf [ sbs : afd ] ) .",
    "work still remains to be done to extend the pattern to all orders in @xmath8 ( cf [ sbs : linerel ] ) .",
    "a non perturbative explanation for the existence of this structure has been found only in the case of the pure gauge .",
    "then indeed , the solution can be compactly expressed using the parametrisation in terms of the gauge group , be it abelian ( cf [ sbs : apg ] ) or not ( cf [ sbs : napg ] ) .",
    "the same kind of parametrisation may be possible in the general case , but has not yet been achieved . some remarks about solving the non - abelian equations",
    "are made in [ sbs : nag ] .",
