    "in a brillouin light scattering ( bls ) experiment spin waves in a magnetic system are probed via inelastic scattering of photons . the spin wave mode or magnon appears as a peak in the recorded spectrum , which is shifted by the magnon frequency @xmath0 relative to the central peak in the spectrum , which in turn is caused by elastically scattered photons .",
    "the shift reflects either an energy loss or energy gain corresponding to the creation ( stokes condition ) or annihilation ( anti - stokes condition ) of a magnon , respectively .",
    "the spectrum contains three different types of information : ( i ) the peak positions , which are determined by the spin wave frequencies , ( ii ) the peak shapes and especially their widths , which are related to the lifetime of the magnons , and ( iii ) the peak areas , which are proportional to the scattering cross - sections .",
    "most experiments focus on an analysis of the spin wave frequencies , which contain information about many magnetic properties such as , for instance , saturation magnetization , anisotropies , and interlayer coupling . with a suitable experimental geometry and procedure ,",
    "these properties can be determined solely on the basis of the magnon frequencies .",
    "the peak width or linewidth contains information about the spin wave lifetime @xmath1 as it results in a linewidth broadening proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "however , in most cases concerning epitaxial samples this magnon linewidth is much smaller than the apparatus broadening of about 1ghz and can not be resolved . only when the magnon lifetime is strongly reduced , _",
    "e.g. _ due to extrinsic two - magnon scattering in the case of exchange bias,@xcite interlayer exchange coupling,@xcite or in polycrystalline samples , the magnon linewidth becomes larger than the apparatus resolution and can be analyzed .",
    "on the other hand , the _ scattering intensities _ , which are the topic of this work , carry information mainly about the precessional amplitudes of the spin waves , but also depend on the optic and magneto - optic properties of the sample . for a full quantitative analysis of the bls spectra",
    ", however , peak positions , line widths , and peak intensities have to be treated on an equal footing .",
    "it is important to note that very few publications @xcite have yet addressed the issue of the scattering intensities , although they contain valuable information about the mode types , the alignment of the magnetic moments and can even be used to investigate the magneto - optic coupling.@xcite this lack of interest is probably due to the fact that the cross - sections can not be easily analyzed in an intuitive manner , but require a comparison with theory . on the other hand ,",
    "the kind of detailed information hidden in the peak intensities is of high relevance for many technological applications , such as data storage and communication technology , because the operation frequencies of contemporary magnetic devices approach the ghz regime , where the magnetization dynamics is closely related to the spin wave modes .",
    "the computation of the scattering intensities is commonly considered to be very complicated.@xcite there is only a handful of research groups , which have successfully developed and applied a suitable formalism , although the computation scheme is now known for more the three decades.@xcite part of the computational complexity stems from the so - called partial waves approach,@xcite which has been used to calculate the spin wave cross - sections in most publications . to our knowledge",
    "this approach has not yet been applied to and solved for noncollinear alignments of the magnetization and , thus , studies dealing with bls intensities in noncollinear states are rarely available.@xcite however exactly those noncollinear states are crucial for the magnetization switching employed in a large number devices , such as for instance mram .",
    "a detailed understanding of the dynamics of noncollinear states is therefore highly desirable and a theoretical description of the spinwave properties of noncollinear states is of high technological relevance .",
    "only three publications @xcite employ the much easier ultrathin film approximation ( utfa),@xcite which has been thought to be accurate only for the lowest - energy modes of ferromagnetic films with thicknesses well below the exchange length , _",
    "i.e. _ a few nanometers in the case of fe . however , in our previous work ( ref .  )",
    "we have shown that the utfa approach can be easily extended in order to accurately describe the modes in thicker films .",
    "we thereby included also the exchange modes and the twisted ground state found in exchange springs and also in the case of very strong interlayer exchange coupling . in the present contribution",
    ", we elucidate how this calculation scheme can be further extended to describe bls cross - sections .",
    "in fact , the cross - section calculation using this method only requires a standard treatment of the light propagation in the multilayer apart from the formulae already presented in ref . .",
    "as we will show below , the optics involved is closely related to the magneto - optic kerr effect ( moke ) .",
    "this has the advantage that existing computer codes for the calculation of the moke can be reused to evaluate the bls intensities .",
    "section [ calc ] gives a detailed description of our computational procedure . in order to demonstrate the accuracy of the scheme we have recomputed the spectrum of ref .   and find an excellent agreement with respect to the peak positions and intensities .",
    "an open - source computer program for the calculation of bls frequencies , precessional amplitudes , and intensities ( although excluding the ground state calculation ) as well as for the calculation of moke can be downloaded from our server , see ref .  .    in sec .",
    "[ section2 ] we apply our formalism to an well characterized epitaxial spin valve structure of the sequence fe(14nm)/cr(0.9nm)/fe(10nm)/ag(6nm)/fe(2 nm ) .",
    "while the bottom fe / cr / fe trilayer couples antiferromagnetically , the top , thin fe layer is decoupled and can be switched more easily by an external field . as a consequence this layer stack shows a rich variety of different spin configurations as a function of field strength and orientation .",

    "is needed in addition to the formalism in ref .  .",
    "the computation is carried out in a sequence of four steps as explained in the following :      the calculation of the magnetic ground state and the spin wave frequencies in the extended utfa is described in detail in ref .  .",
    "in brief , the intralayer exchange within the ferromagnetic layers is treated as an effective bilinear interlayer coupling @xmath7 between thin virtual sheets of the ferromagnetic material .",
    "the virtual multilayer consisting of the virtual ferromagnetic sheets is then treated within the conventional utfa approach.@xcite it is of crucial importance to divide the ferromagnetic layers into thin enough sheets in order to obtain ( i ) the correct ground state for the case of strong interlayer coupling or ( ii ) the frequencies of modes , which are not uniform in the perpendicular direction , _",
    "i.e. _ damon - eshbach modes , optic and exchange modes .",
    "in particular , an improper ground state configuration can lead to the disappearance of some modes , especially the optic modes in antiferromagnetically coupled systems .",

    "the interaction of the spin waves with the electromagnetic wave via the magneto - optic coupling has to be taken into account .",
    "the spin wave induces a polarization @xmath28 inside sheet @xmath24 oscillating at @xmath29:@xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the magnetic part of the dielectric tensor , @xmath32 is the linear magneto - optic coupling constant , @xmath33 is the electric field of the light , and @xmath23 is the dynamic magnetization , each inside the magnetic sheet with index @xmath24 .",

    "the procedure is exactly the same for the reflected and the @xmath40 backscattered light .",

    "this small deviation should not arise from using the extended utfa , which only slightly overestimates ( less than 0.2ghz ) the frequency of the highest modes as compared to the partial waves method .",
    "it might , however , be due to the fact that we used the magnetostatic approximation , _",

    "the graphs can be divided into three distinct field regions bounded by switching events : for low field values ( @xmath78mt ) there is a distinct asymmetry between the stokes and the anti - stokes side .",
    "this unique feature proves an antiparallel alignment of the magnetic moments of the two bottommost fe layers collinear with the external field applied in easy axis direction.@xcite at higher fields ( @xmath79mt ) the antiferromagnetically coupled bottom fe / cr / fe double layer switches into a canted configuration with a relative angle between the layers magnetizations of about @xmath80 .",

    "another reason could be the necessary reduction of the huge number of fitting parameters .",
    "we also point out the notable asymmetry between stokes and anti - stokes frequencies in the saturated state , especially of the lowest optic modes in the hard axis configuration , which could not be fully reproduced by the fit .",
    "it is known that such an asymmetry can stem from asymmetric interface anisotropies,@xcite , which could not be properly taken into account in the calculation as the large number of at least six interface anisotropy parameters ( one for each interface ) is very cumbersome to fit .        while an applied external field will tend to align the thickest bottom layer and the thinnest uncoupled top layer in the field direction and , thus , fix the magnetization directions of all layers in the antiferromagnetic state in easy axis configuration , the situation gets much more complex when the field approaches the zero value . in zero external field",

    "<S> the scattering of photons from spin waves ( brillouin light scattering  bls ) is a well - established technique for the study of layered magnetic systems . </S>",

    "<S> b * 67 * , 184404 ( 2003 ) ] , we have shown that spin wave frequencies can be conveniently calculated within the ultrathin film approach , treating the intralayer exchange as an effective bilinear interlayer coupling between thin virtual sheets of the ferromagnetic layers . here </S>",
    "<S> we give the consequent extension of this approach to the calculation of the brillouin light scattering ( bls ) peak intensities . given the very close relation of the bls cross - section to the magneto - optic kerr effect ( moke ) , the depth - resolved longitudinal and polar moke coefficients calculated numerically via the usual magneto - optic formalism can be employed in combination with the spin wave precessional amplitudes to calculate full bls spectra for a given magnetic system . </S>",
    "<S> this approach allows an easy calculation of bls intensities even for noncollinear spin configurations including the exchange modes . </S>",
    "<S> the formalism is applied to a fe / cr / fe / ag / fe trilayer system with one antiferromagnetically coupling spacer ( cr ) . </S>",
    "<S> good agreement with the experimental spectra is found for a wide variety of spin configurations . </S>"
