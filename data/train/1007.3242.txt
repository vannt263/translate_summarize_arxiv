    "[ exdouble ] . as shown in fig .",
    "[ exdouble](a ) , the use of linearly chirped poling leads to broadband spectra .",
    "the low - frequency photon would be filtered using the bragg grating , while the high - frequency photon could be filtered by placing a narrowband filter at the output detector .",
    "the generation of narrowband spectra could , in principle , be achieved by making use of aperiodic poling ; however , this would require poling periods so small that they might be beyond the capabilities of current fabrication techniques .",
    "the presence of dispersion is deleterious to the operation of photonic circuits used for many quantum - information applications .",
    "dispersion results from the dependence of the propagation constant @xmath74 on frequency , mode number , and polarization .",
    "polarization - mode dispersion generally provides the strongest contribution , especially in a birefringent material such as linbo@xmath0 .",
    "however , the type-0 @xmath62 interaction , by virtue of its three parallel electric field vectors , suffers only from frequency and modal dispersion , and these are often sufficiently weak that they can be neglected for short devices .",
    "this is not the case for type - ii circuits , however , where polarization - mode dispersion is indeed dominant .    in this section ,",
    "we address the management of dispersion and consider possible ways of mitigating it in photonic circuits , whatever the type of interaction .",
    "the optimal approach for circumventing dispersion depends on the particular application .",
    "an example that proves instructive is the photonic - circuit hom interferometer , in which a simple adjustment of the path length can be effective .",
    "the photonic circuit shown in fig .",
    "[ circuiti ] provides for the generation , separation , and guiding of two spdc photons into two distinct smw output ports .",
    "an hom interferometer can be fabricated on the same chip by feeding these outputs into a 3-db coupler endowed with an electro - optic phase modulator in one of its input arms .",
    "this allows a variable phase delay to be introduced between the photons , thereby enabling an interferogram to be generated .",
    "the presence of dispersion alters the coincidence rate @xmath40 associated with the hom interferometer .",
    "the origin of this effect can be understood by casting the interferometer as a four - port system with each arm behaving as an ideal phase filter . referring to fig .",
    "[ circuiti ] , the matrix @xmath116 that relates the output and input of the system then takes the form @xmath117 \\ , \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } 1 & j \\\\",
    "j & 1\\end{array } \\right]\\,\\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } h\\left ( \\omega\\right)h_{o } \\left ( \\omega\\right ) & 0 \\\\ 0 & h\\left ( \\omega\\right)h_{e } \\left ( \\omega\\right)\\end{array }   \\right],\\ ] ] with @xmath118   \\\\",
    "h_{o}\\left ( \\omega\\right)&=\\exp\\left[-j \\beta_{1,\\sigma}\\left ( \\omega\\right)\\,l_{o}\\right ]   \\\\   h_{e}\\left ( \\omega\\right ) & = \\exp\\left [ -j\\beta_{1,\\sigma}\\left ( \\omega\\right)\\ ,   l_{t}/2    -j\\beta_{0,\\sigma}\\left ( \\omega\\right)\\left ( l_{e}+ l_{t}/2\\right ) \\right ] , \\end{array } \\label{phasefilters}\\ ] ] where @xmath119 is the length of an arm of the 3-db coupler ; @xmath120 and @xmath121 are the distances traveled by the even and odd modes from the generation region to the 3-db coupler , respectively ; @xmath73 is the length of the tapered region ; and the sandwiched matrix characterizes the lossless beam splitter .",
    "the mode in the adiabatically tapered region is assumed to propagate with propagation constant @xmath122 $ ] .",
    "the presence of dispersion results in a modification of the coincidence rate @xmath123 .",
    "in particular , the second term of ( [ coincidence ] ) is modified by the quantity @xmath124 where @xmath23 , and the @xmath125 are elements of the @xmath126 matrix with @xmath127 and @xmath128 representing row and column indexes , respectively . substituting ( [ transmatrix ] ) and ( [ phasefilters ] ) into ( [ dispfactor ] ) yields @xmath129 \\left[l_{o}-l_{t}/2\\right ] \\ ; -j\\left[\\beta_{0,\\sigma_{s}}\\left ( \\omega_s\\right)-\\beta_{0,\\sigma_{i}}\\left ( \\omega_i\\right ) \\right ] \\left[l_{e}+l_{t}/2\\right ] \\right\\rbrace , \\ ] ] which , together with ( [ eqpolingperiods ] ) , gives rise to @xmath130 \\left[l_{o}-l_{e}-l_{t}\\right ] \\right .",
    ".\\ ] ] it is apparent that choosing @xmath131 results in dispersion cancelation at the preselected frequencies",
    ". moreover , it leads to even - order dispersion cancelation for other frequency components as well .",
    "more generally , the deleterious effects of dispersion can be mitigated by mapping every possibility for each available degree of freedom into a different path , resulting in the conversion of modal , spectral , and polarization entanglement into path entanglement .",
    "consider , as an example , a type - ii @xmath105 interaction . in this case ,",
    "frequency and polarization are effectively only a single degree of freedom since the photon with frequency above ( below ) the degenerate value is always @xmath132 ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "thus , two degrees of freedom suffice for characterizing the system : frequency or polarization and mode number . a photonic circuit for converting these two degrees of freedom into photons entangled in path is sketched in fig .  [ circuitiii ] .",
    "the photons are first separated on the basis of their frequencies , and then on the basis of their mode numbers .",
    "each output port thus carries only a particular degree of freedom , thereby skirting the distinguishability engendered by dispersion - induced time delay .",
    "the circuit displayed in fig .",
    "[ circuitiii ] can be viewed as a superposition of those illustrated in figs .",
    "[ circuiti ] and [ circuitii ] .    the biphoton state entangled in path can be written as @xmath133,\\ ] ] where the subscripts 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 refer to the output ports labeled in fig .",
    "[ circuitiii ] .",
    "the photon of frequency @xmath22 is assumed to be back - reflected by the holographic bragg grating .    in the case of double entanglement , each output port in a circuit such as that shown in fig .",
    "[ circuitiii ] would deliver photons with either te- or tm - polarization . to avoid distinguishability as a result of polarization - mode dispersion ,",
    "two methods could be used : 1 ) each output port could be split into a pair of ports , resulting in eight doubly entangled paths ; or 2 ) an electro - optic te@xmath134tm mode converter @xcite could be used at the path center of each output port , thereby advancing the slow , and retarding the fast , photons in such a way that they would arrive simultaneously at the output detectors .",
    "we have presented several photonic - circuit designs based on ti : linbo@xmath0 diffused channel waveguides for generating photons with various combinations of modal , spectral , and polarization entanglement .",
    "these circuits contain , in various forms , a nonlinear periodically poled two - mode waveguide structure , single- and two - mode waveguide - based couplers , and multiplexed holographic bragg gratings .",
    "depending on the choice of parameters , the first photonic circuit produces frequency - degenerate down - converted photons with even spatial parity , nondegenerate down - converted photons entangled in frequency , or nondegenerate down - converted photons simultaneously entangled in frequency and polarization .",
    "the second photonic circuit produces modal entanglement , or photons that are doubly entangled in mode number and polarization .",
    "the third photonic circuit converts modal , spectral , and polarization entanglement into path entanglement to mitigate the effects of dispersion .",
    "simulations have been carried out , with the help of the the commercial photonic and network design software package rsoft , to gauge the performance of these circuits .",
    "furthermore , since ti : linbo@xmath0 photonic circuits have the salutary property of permitting the generation , transmission , and processing of photons to be accommodated on a single chip , we expect that they will find use in the efficient implementation of various quantum information processing schemes @xcite .      c.  h. bennett and g.  brassard , `` quantum cryptography : public key distribution and coin tossing , '' in _ proceedings of the international conference on computers , systems & signal processing_.1em plus 0.5em minus 0.4embangalore , india : institute of electrical and electronics engineers , dec .",
