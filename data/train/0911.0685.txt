    "the primary source of uncertainty in the models is that gravitational time delay and lensing substructures can lead to anomalous quasar magnification ratios , which translate into an uncertainty in the quasar luminosity .",

    "* ) , we find the preponderance of @xmath69  @xmath8  bhs radiating at @xmath74 of their eddington luminosity to be noteworthy",
    ".    we can be slightly more quantitative .",
    "following , e.g. , @xcite , we can transform the observed @xmath75 galaxy mass function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) into the expected bh mass function . for reference , at the median luminosity of the triplespec sample ,",
    "the eddington limit sets a bound of @xmath76  @xmath8  on observable bhs . if the relation between @xmath6and galaxy mass were identical to what it is today ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then the bhs with mass @xmath77  @xmath8  ought to be @xmath78 times more common than the median observed mass of @xmath6@xmath79  @xmath8 .",
    "note that we are conservatively adopting the median rather than the minimum observed luminosity and assuming that the eddington luminosity applies strictly .",
    "taking the observed masses at face value for the moment , and assuming that the selection of lensed quasars is simply a random selection of optically luminous quasars at @xmath80 , then we infer that either bhs radiating at 30% of eddington are @xmath78 times more numerous than eddington - limited objects or that the zeropoint in the @xmath62  relation has evolved by a factor of @xmath81 to the present day .",
    "this latter , of course , is the suggestion made by p06",
    ".    obviously , such constraints are not particularly stringent at the moment .",
    "for one thing , the selection of lensed quasars is complicated to model , involving radio selection in some cases .",
    "furthermore , as pointed out by somerville , joint constraints from galaxy and quasar luminosity functions on their own can not distinguish between zeropoint evolution or increased scatter in bh - bulge relations at high redshift .",
    "finally , we do not know that the quasar duty cycle is independent of mass .",
    "nevertheless , we can not help but wonder whether the narrow range in observed line width , and the unexpectedly high average bh mass , do not instead indicate a problem in virial mass estimators at high luminosity that may be resolved with better understanding of the physics of broad - line quasars .",
    "ultimately , the question is whether or not the broad emission lines in luminous quasars are dominated by virial motions .",
    "of course , there is evidence for a non - virialized component in the  line ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . on the other hand ,",
    "there is clear evidence for virialized motion in the broad - line regions of at least a few nearby lower - luminosity active galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . also , the local virial masses seem to correlate with both @xmath82(e.g .",
    "* ) and @xmath83 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , similar analysis is not yet available in the luminosity range of interest to us . at present , all we can say is that the -based masses alone are not causing a net bias in the virial masses relative to the balmer lines .",
    "true evolution in bh - bulge scaling relations is by no means certain ; far more pernicious sources of uncertainty remain , including potential biases in sample selection . at the minimum , to mitigate these concerns , quasar samples with identical selection at multiple redshifts are needed .    in closing",
    ", we note that bh - bulge relations are not the only ones purported to display unexpected evolution since a redshift @xmath84 .",
    "recent work has shown that , at a fixed mass , elliptical galaxies were a factor of two to five smaller at redshifts of one and two respectively than they are today .",
    "at first it seems counterintuitive that the most massive elliptical galaxies , which seem to have formed the bulk of their stars rapidly at an earlier epoch ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , should grow less dense with time .",
    "however , a large number of minor mergers can very efficiently build the outskirts of elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "interestingly , these gas - free minor mergers would need to grow the total galaxy mass by factors of two to three in order to match local observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is possible under a scenario where the bh - to - total stellar mass relation is steeper than linearity in low mass galaxies , which is observed in nearby galaxies @xcite . in gas - free merging",
    "there is no corresponding bh growth via accretion , which could facilitate a boost in the bh - bulge ratio at late times ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "as argued by @xcite , numerous minor mergers will tend to drive the ratio of bh to galaxy mass towards a value of unity slope ( e.g. , his fig .",
    "2b and 4a ) . alternatively , as suggested by both @xcite and @xcite , it may be that disk components are common in the high redshift galaxies but are subsequently subsumed into the main elliptical galaxy body .",
    "we mention this apparent coincidence in passing because it is intriguing , although we note that a variety of outstanding uncertainties are yet to be explored as far as the structural evolution of elliptical galaxies is concerned .",
    "we revisit the bh mass estimates for a sample of lensed quasars with high - fidelity host - galaxy luminosities from @xcite .",
    "while the balmer - based masses presented here are arguably more robust than the uv - based estimates , we find no evidence for a systematic difference in bh masses based on the two methods . if we can take the balmer - based virial masses at face value , then we confirm the result of @xcite that bhs appear to be overly massive relative to their hosts at high redshift .",
    "intriguingly , the minor mergers that are invoked to puff up compact elliptical galaxies at late times would be very effective at boosting the galaxy to bh mass ratio as well .",
    "however , as pointed out many times , the persistently narrow range in observed line width for luminous quasars at high redshift provides substantial cause for concern in the veracity of the virial masses .",
    "furthermore , it is not clear that we have yet assembled consistent comparison quasar samples across cosmic time with which to compare the bh - bulge scaling relations .",
    "our work is a necessary , but not sufficient , step in determining the true evolution of bh - bulge relations with cosmic time .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ,",
