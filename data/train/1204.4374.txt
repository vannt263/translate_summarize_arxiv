    "large , modern cities also have a public transportation network ( e.g. , bus and rail systems ) to ensure easy and fast travel between two places . traveling in such cities can be modeled well by the _ city metric_. this metric is induced by quickest paths in the @xmath0 metric in the presence of an accelerating transportation network .",
    "we assume that the traveling speed on the transportation network is a given parameter @xmath12 .",
    "the speed while traveling off the network is  1 .",
    "further , we assume that the transportation network can be accessed at any point .",

    "the @xmath1-ordercity voronoi diagram can be used to resolve the following situation : a pedestrian wants to know the @xmath15 nearest facilities ( e.g. , @xmath15 stores , or @xmath15 hospitals ) such that he can make a well - informed decision as to which facility to go to . for this kind of scenario ,",
    "the @xmath1-ordercity voronoi diagram provides a way to determine the @xmath15 nearest facilities , by modeling the facilities as point sites .    the nearest - site ( first - order ) city voronoi diagram has already been well - studied @xcite .",
    "its structural complexity ( the size ) has been proved to be @xmath16 @xcite , where @xmath5 is the complexity of the transportation network .",
    "such a voronoi diagram can be constructed in @xmath17 time @xcite . however , to the best of our knowledge there is no existing work regarding @xmath1-order or farthest - site ( i.e. , @xmath18-order ) city voronoi diagrams .",
    "contrary to @xmath1-ordercity voronoi diagrams , @xmath1-ordereuclidean voronoi diagrams have been studied extensively for over thirty years .",
    "their structural complexity has been shown to be @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "they can be computed by an iterative construction method in @xmath19 time @xcite or by a different approach based on geometric duality and arrangements in @xmath20 time  @xcite .",
    "additionally , there are several randomized algorithms @xcite and on - line algorithms @xcite .",
    "one of the most significant differences between the euclidean metric and the city metric that influences the computation and complexity of voronoi diagrams is the complexity of a bisector between two points . in the euclidean or the @xmath0 metric",
    "such a bisector has constant complexity , while in the city metric the complexity may be @xmath21  @xcite and can even be a closed curve . since the properties of a bisector between two points significantly affect the properties of voronoi diagrams , a @xmath1-ordercity voronoi diagram can be very different from a euclidean one .",
    "first , this property makes it non - trivial to apply existing approaches for constructing euclidean voronoi diagrams to the city voronoi diagrams .",
