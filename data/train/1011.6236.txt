    "the laser driven dynamics of distant quantum systems can depend in general on the spatial and temporal envelope of the applied laser field .",

    "although the h atoms are far away from each other , their electron - electron interaction should not be _ a  priori _ neglected , especially upon their excitation by the laser field , because the electronic wave functions extend and vanish , strictly speaking , only at infinity .",
    "therefore , the energy transfer among distant quantum systems , similar to that studied in , can be anticipated to occur in spatially shaped laser fields as well .",
    "for ultrashort laser pulses , containing only few optical cycles , one must also consider the carrier envelope phase ( cep ) of the pulse @xcite .    the long - range energy transfer from an excited atom to its neighbor has been recently studied by cederbaum _",

    "since helium atoms have no inner - valence electrons , a different type of icd is operative for this case .",

    "accordingly , the initial state of a molecular h - h system is assumed to be entangled by spin exchange and represented by the heitler - london symmetric product of atomic wave functions , while the initial state of an atomic h - h system is not entangled  it is a direct - product state of atomic wave functions . in both cases",

    "both unentangled direct - product atomic states and entangled molecular states have been used as the initial states of the h - h system in our numerical simulations .",
    "the first case , unentangled atomic states , is more likely to arise in an experiment : at a gas pressure of 1  atm .",
    ", for example , the interatomic distance is about 100  a.u .. the second case , entangled molecular states , requires an additional step : dissociation of the h@xmath7 molecule , or generation of entanglement between two individual atoms .",
    "the field strengths of the spatially shaped laser pulses were chosen such as not to induce a strong ionization and the respective decrease of the overall norm of the wave packet of h - h . in stronger fields and with longer pulses both the energy transfer and",
    "the ` sequential ' ionization can be more efficient than those presented above .",
    "the parameters of the laser pulses used in the present work ( in particular the pulse duration , @xmath6  fs , and especially the laser carrier frequency , @xmath192  a.u . )",
    "are not yet optimal , and more efforts will be required in order to find optimal spatially shaped laser fields suitable for the most efficient energy transfer and ` sequential ' ionization .",
    "we have shown that in the case of a narrow spatial envelope of the applied laser field , when only electrons initially belonging to atom  a are excited by the laser field , the physical mechanisms of the energy transfer from atom  a to atom  b and the ` sequential ' ionization of atom  b are as follows : ( i ) the coulombic attraction of the laser - driven electrons by proton @xmath77 of atom  b , resulting in the formation of narrow local maxima of the electronic wave functions in the vicinity of proton @xmath77 , and ( ii ) the short - range coulomb repulsion of the two electrons in the vicinity of proton @xmath77 , where their wave functions strongly overlap . in a more general case of a wide spatial envelope of the laser field , for example a broad gaussian ,",
    "when both a and b atoms are excited by the field simultaneously , the same processes occur in the opposite direction as well : the energy is also transferred from atom  b to atom  a and the eer - induced ` sequential ' ionization also occurs in atom  a.    furthermore , we have shown that long - range entanglement of the initially unentangled direct - product state is established by the interaction with a spatially shaped laser pulse .",
    "long - range entanglement attracts considerable interest these days .",
    "for example , entanglement transfer from dissociated molecules to photons has been explored in @xcite , where the concept of transferring the quantum state of two dissociated fragments sharing internal - translational entanglement to that of two photons and vice versa has been put forward . a special kind of an entangled state of one electron and two protons in a h@xmath12 molecule adiabatically stretched to @xmath193  a.u .",

    "experimental generation of entanglement between two individual @xmath194rb atoms held in two optical tweezers , separated by 4  @xmath195 m , has been reported in @xcite .",
    "finally we mention that quantum entanglement among extended biomolecules has been explored in @xcite ( see also references therein ) .",
    "the results obtained in @xcite demonstrate that there exists robust quantum entanglement among chlorophyll molecules under physiological conditions for the case of a single elementary excitation .",
    "the main characteristic features of the entangled molecular initial states in our h - h model , as compared to the unentangled atomic direct - product ones , are as follows : ( i ) the immediate response of atom  b to the laser excitation of atom  a , and ( ii ) the existence of fast out - of - phase oscillations of the ` atomic ' energies @xmath54 and @xmath55 after the end of the applied laser pulse .",
    "these features should occur in a long - range quantum communication among distant quantum systems for the following reason .",
    "the time - dependent ` atomic ' energies @xmath54 and @xmath55 represent the information encoded in the laser pulse . therefore ,",
    "if only one atom  a of the entangled a - b pair is excited by the laser pulse , the encoded information reaches atom  b ( receiver ) instantaneously and , moreover , can be decoded both during and after the end of the pulse acting on atom  a.    we have found that in the case of a narrow spatial envelope of an applied laser pulse , which excites only electrons belonging to atom  a , the ` sequential ' eer - induced ionization of atom  b is more efficient than the laser - induced ionization of atom  a [ see figs .",
    "2(f ) and 6(e ) ] .",
    "these results suggest important consequences for more complex quantum systems , e.g. those composed of three and more distant sub - systems , such as @xmath196 .",
    "if we excite by a laser pulse with a narrow spatial envelope only sub - system  @xmath197 , for example , and if ionization probabilities obey @xmath198 , we can stimulate an efficient chain of ` sequential ' ionization events with ever increasing probability in the total @xmath199 system .",
    "the same may also apply to the energy transfer in the @xmath199 system .",
    "to achieve such collective energy transfer and ` sequential ' ionization , a narrow spatial shaping of the laser field as reported in @xcite needs further exploration . to achieve the condition @xmath198 in the @xmath199 systems with a gaussian spatial envelope of eq.([e - g ] ) , we can always choose @xmath200 such that the effective - field amplitudes obey @xmath201 .",

    "<S> the quantum dynamics of two distant h atoms excited by ultrashort and spatially shaped laser pulses is studied by the numerical solution of the non - born - oppenheimer time - dependent schrdinger equation within a three - dimensional ( 3d ) model , including the internuclear distance @xmath0 and the two @xmath1 coordinates of the electrons , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the two 1d hydrogen atoms , a and b , are assumed to be initially in their ground states with a large ( but otherwise arbitrary ) internuclear separation of @xmath4  a.u . </S>",
    "<S> ( 5.29  nm ) . </S>",
    "<S> two types of a spatial envelope of a laser field linearly polarized along the @xmath1-axis are considered : ( i ) a broad gaussian envelope , such that atom  a is excited by the laser field predominantly , and ( ii ) a narrow envelope , such that practically only atom  a is excited by the laser field . with the laser carrier frequency @xmath5  a.u . and the pulse duration @xmath6  fs , in both cases an efficient energy transfer from atom  a to atom  b has been found . </S>",
    "<S> the ionization of atom  b achieved mostly after the end of the laser pulse is close to or even higher than that of atom  a. it is shown that with a narrow spatial envelope of the laser field , the underlying mechanisms of the energy transfer from a to b and the ionization of b are the coulomb attraction of the laser driven electron by the proton of atom  b and a short - range coulomb repulsion of the two electrons when their wave functions significantly overlap in the domain of atom  b. in the case of a broad gaussian spatial envelope of the laser field , the opposite process also occurs , but with smaller probability : the energy is transferred from the weakly excited atom  b to atom  a , and the ionization of atom  a is also induced by the electron - electron repulsion in the domain of atom  a due to a strong overlap of the electronic wave functions . </S>"
