    "groundwater is crucial to human being , environment and economy , because a large portion of drinking water comes from groundwater , and it is extracted for commercial , industrial and irrigation uses .",
    "groundwater also sustains stream flow during dry periods , and is critical to the function of streams , wetlands and other aquatic environments .",
    "therefore , protecting the safety and security of groundwater is essential for communities , and for the environment . in recent years",
    ", mathematical models have used to analyze ground water system .",
    "there are two notable approaches in dealing with groundwater modeling , the forward and backward approaches .",
    "the former is going to predict unknown variables by solving appropriate governing equations , while the latter is going to determine unknown physical parameters .",
    "most of groundwater models are distributed parameter models , where the parameters used in the modeling equations are not directly obtained from physical observations , but from trial - and - error and graphical fitting techniques .",
    "if large errors are included in mathematical model structure , model parameters , sink / source terms and boundary conditions , the model can not produce accurate results . to deal with this issue , the inverse problem of parameter identification has been applied . in groundwater applications such as in finding a previous pollution source intensity from observation data of the pollutant concentrations at a later time , or in designing the final state of melting and freezing processes ,",
    "it is necessary to construct a heat source at any given time from the final outcome state data .",
    "the groundwater inverse problem has been studied since the middle of 1970s by mclaughin ( 1975 ) , yeh ( 1986 ) , kuiper ( 1986 ) , carrera ( 1987 ) , ginn and cushman ( 1990 ) and sun ( 1994 ) , etc ( see in @xcite ) . some remarkable results on this research area",
    "should be mentioned by mclaughlin and townley ( 1996 ) @xcite and poeter and hill ( 1997 ) @xcite . under consideration of a solute diffusion , the flow and self - purifying function of watershed system ,",
    "the concentration of pollution @xmath0 at any time in a watershed is described by following one - dimensional linear parabolic equation : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the spatial studied domain , @xmath3 is the diffusion coefficient , @xmath4 is mean velocity of water in the watershed , and @xmath5 is the self - purifying function of the watershed , @xmath6 is the source term causing the pollution function @xmath7 . by setting @xmath8 and @xmath9 then eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) becomes @xmath10 this equation is well - known parabolic heat equation with time - dependent coefficients .",
    "this equation has been investigated for the heat source with either temporal @xcite , or @xcite only .",
    "there are few studies on identification of the source term depending on both time and space in term of a separable form of @xmath11 , as @xmath12 ; where @xmath13 is a given function ; for instance hassanov @xcite identified the heat source in the form of @xmath14 for the variable coefficient heat conduction equation ; @xmath15 under the variational method .",
    "however , in the case with the time - dependent coefficient of @xmath16 , there are still limited results .",
    "+ in this study , we consider the equation for groundwater pollution as follows : @xmath17 with initial and final conditions @xmath18 and boundary condition @xmath19 here , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath13 are given functions . in this paper , we will determine the source term @xmath22 from the inexact observed data of @xmath13 and @xmath21 .",
    "+ let @xmath23 and @xmath24 be the norm and the inner product in @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "now , we take an orthonormal basis in @xmath25 satisfying the boundary condition ( [ eq:4 ] ) , particularly the basic function @xmath26 for @xmath27 condition . then , by an elementary calculation the problem ( [ eq:2 ] ) under the conditions ( [ eq:3 ] ) and ( [ eq:4 ] ) can be transformed into following corresponding problem @xmath28 @xmath29 by setting @xmath30 , we can solve the ordinary differential equation ( [ eq:5 ] ) with the contitions ( [ eq:6 ] ) .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath31 which leads to @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "+ note that @xmath34 increases rather quickly once @xmath35 becomes large .",
    "thus , the exact data function @xmath21 must satisfy that @xmath36 decays at least as the same speed of @xmath37 .",
    "however , in application the input data @xmath21 from observations will never be exact due to the measurements .",
    "we assume the data functions @xmath38 , and @xmath39 satisfy @xmath40 where @xmath41 represents a noise from observations .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to determine a conditional stability , and provide the revised generalized tikhonov regularization method .",
    "in addition , the stability estimate between the regularization solution and the exact solution is obtained .",
    "for explanation of this method , we impose an a priori bound on the data @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a constant , and @xmath44 denotes the norm in the sobolev space @xmath45 of order @xmath46 can be naturally defined in terms of fourier series whose coefficients decay rapidly ; namely , @xmath47 equipped with the norm @xmath48 where @xmath49 defined by @xmath50 is the fourier coefficient of @xmath51 . +",
    "as a regularization method , the tikhonov method has been used to solve ill - posed problems in a number of publications . however , most of previous works focus on an a priori choice of the regularization parameter .",
    "there is usually a defect in any a priori method ; i.e. the a priori choice of the regularization parameter depends obviously on the a priori bound @xmath52 of the unknown solution .",
    "in fact , the a priori bound @xmath52 can not be known exactly in practice , and working with a wrong constant @xmath52 may lead to a bad regularization solution . in this paper , we mainly consider the a posteriori choice of a regularization parameter for the mollification method .",
    "using the discrepancy principle we provide a new posteriori parameter choice rule .",
    "+ the outline of this paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "a conditional stability is introduced .",
    "a tikhonov regularization and its convergence under an a priori parameter choice rule is presented in section 3 . similarly to section 3 , another tikhonov regularization and its convergence under a posteriori parameter choice rule is shown in section 4 . in section 5 ,",
    "we introduce two numerical examples , which are implemented from proposal regularization methods , the numerical results are compared with exact solutions .",

    "<S> in this paper , we consider an inverse problem to determine a in a parabolic equation , where the data are obtained at a certain time . in general , this problem is ill - posed , therefore the tikhonov regularization method is proposed to solve the problem . in the theoretical results , </S>",
    "<S> a priori error estimate between the exact solution and its regularized solution is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> we also propose both methods , a priori and a posteriori parameter choice rules . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the proposed methods have been verified by numerical experiments to estimate the errors between the regularized solutions and exact solutions . </S>",
    "<S> eventually , from the numerical results it shows that the a posteriori parameter choice rule method gives a better the convergence speed in comparison with the a priori parameter choice rule method in some specific applications .   </S>",
