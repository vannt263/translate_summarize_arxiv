    "we also used the space motion of each star to assign it to the thin or thick disk population , and investigated the color , metallicity and activity differences between the two populations (  [ sec : diffs ] ) .",
    "the sample was binned in 100 pc increments of vertical distance from the galactic plane and probability plots of @xmath2 velocities were constructed @xcite .",

    "our sample is well suited to rigorously test current galactic models .",
    "we chose the besanon model as a fiducial , since it simulates both star counts and kinematics .",
    "this model is constructed on several assumptions and empirical constraints , with the goal of reproducing the stellar content of the milky way .",
    "four populations comprise the model : the thin and thick disks , bulge and halo . for each population , a star - formation history , initial mass function ,",
    "density law and age are imposed .",
    "additionally , an age - metallicity relation is employed for each population , with a gaussian dispersion about the mean metallicity of each component ( see tables 1 and 3 of ) .",
    "kinematically , the thin disk is composed of 7 groups of different ages ( from 0.0 to 10 gyr ) , each being isothermal except for the youngest ( 0.0 - 0.15 gyr ) .",
    "the thick disk is composed of an 11 gyr old population , with a velocity ellipsoid based on the measurements of .",
    "an age - velocity dispersion relation from @xcite is imposed on each component , and the model is then allowed to self - consistently evolve to the present - day .",
    "this self - consistency is achieved with the method described in .",
    "stellar populations are formed according to their appropriate density laws and introduced with an initial velocity dispersion .",
    "the mass density of the stars is summed in a column of unit volume centered on the sun along with dark matter halo and interstellar material contributions , and the potential is computed using the poisson equation .",
    "stars are then evolved using the collisionless boltzmann equation in this new potential , and redistributed in the @xmath44 direction , as complete orbital evolution is not included in this model .",
    "the process is iterated until the potential and scale heights of the disk populations converge at the 1% level .",
    "the local - mass density , which was empirically determined by , also imposes a constraint on the initial galactic potential .",
    "we note that imposing an age - velocity dispersion relation on the model dominates the kinematics , and that there are significant uncertainties in these relations .",
    "for example , the age - velocity dispersions used by differ by factors of @xmath0 2 for the oldest stars , compared to the relations in @xcite .",
    "these discrepancies are primarily derived from the difficulty in determining ages of field stars , with systematic differences imposed by various methods ( i.e. isochrone fitting vs. chromospheric ages ) .",
    "intrinsic properties such as age , mass , luminosity , metallicity , position and velocity are available for each star in the simulation .",
    "observable properties , such as colors , proper motions and radial velocities are also reported . to determine colors",
    ", the model uses the database , which employs adjusted stellar synthetic spectra that attempt to match empirical color - temperature relations .",
    "we queried the besanon webpage , generating a suite of synthetic datasets along the appropriate galactic sightline of slomass ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) with proper magnitude limits and error characteristics .",
    "we included both the thin and thick disks in the model inputs .",
    "the bulge and halo components were excluded since slomass points away from the bulge , and with a maximum distance of @xmath0 2000 pc , we expect halo contamination to be minimal .",
    "a total of 25 models were generated from identical input , in order to minimize poisson noise .",
    "as a consistency test of the besanon model , we compared the model star counts to those obtained with sdss survey photometry in the slomass field .",
    "we queried the sdss catalog archive server for good point spread photometry of stars along the appropriate sightline .",
    "this query resulted in 46,730 stellar targets . in the models , the mean star count was 46,991 with a standard deviation of 137 .",
    "this excellent agreement should be viewed cautiously , as only rough magnitude cuts were imposed on the besanon models , and we did not attempt to model observational problems that would affect sdss star counts @xcite , such as cosmic rays or diffraction spikes near bright stars . however , the test inspires confidence that the besanon model adequately represents the observed sdss star counts .",
    "each of the 25 models was sub - sampled to reproduce the color and distance distributions observed in slomass .",
    "the two - dimensional color - distance density distribution was computed for slomass , and color - distance pairs were randomly drawn according to this normalized density distribution . if the color - distance pair was found in the besanon model , then it was kept .",
    "this monte - carlo sampling continued until there were 7398 color - distance pairs , matching the number of stars in slomass .",
    "this sampling forced each model to simulate the properties of the slomass observations when compared to the complete sdss photometry .",
    "since sdss @xmath31 colors are not available for the besanon model , the slomass colors were transformed to @xmath47 using the relations of @xcite .",
    "shown in figure [ fig : modelcomp ] are the @xmath47 and distance distributions for one instance of the model , along with those from slomass .",
    "thus , each model is  observed \" in a manner consistent with the spectroscopic observations of the sdss field photometry .      using the sub - sampled model data",
    ", we compared the kinematic predictions of the besanon models to the @xmath2 velocities of slomass . using the method described in ",
    "[ sec : kinematics ] , we constructed two sets of probability plots for each model : one composed of the thin and thick disk stars and one measured solely for the thin disk .",
    "the reason for this separation was twofold .",
    "the first was to isolate any systematics between the models thin and thick disk predictions . additionally , this allowed for direct testing comparison of the thin disk predictions , since most of these stars lie on the inner `` core '' region of the probability plot .",
    "that is , if the velocity predictions are correct for the thin disk , the overall slope of the isolated thin disk models should roughly match the `` core '' slope measured from slomass .    in figure",
    "[ fig : model_probs ] , an illustrative example of this analysis is shown .",
    "the main effect of adding the thick disk component is to increase the slope of both the core and wing components . additionally , the wing component is enhanced , as seen in the @xmath43 velocity distribution , which is expected from addition of a high dispersion population .",
    "it is clear from comparing to figure [ fig : uvwcdf ] that the combination of the thin and thick disk model predictions are necessary to simulate the structure seen in the slomass data .",
    "following the method explained in ",
    "[ sec : kinematics ] we measured the slopes of the `` core '' and `` wing '' components of the each model as a function of distance from the galactic plane .",
    "the results of this analysis , compared to the slomass results are shown in figures [ fig : disp_comp ] and [ fig : mean_comp ] .",
    "the slomass results ( open squares ) , which are shown in figure [ fig : veldisps ] , are compared to the average besanon prediction ( crosses ) for the thin ( upper panels ) and thick disk ( lower panels ) .",
    "while the model does well in predicting general trends , there are clearly some systematics .",
    "the model predictions for the @xmath48 thin disk velocity dispersions are systematically low , suggesting there may be flaws in the method used to compute these motions . additionally , the model underestimates the thick disk @xmath49 dispersions at large galactic heights . as described above (  [ sec : model ] ) , the assumed age - velocity dispersions relations , which dominate the predicted kinematic structure , are uncertain and may contribute to this disagreement .",
    "this speculation is supported by the results summarized in table [ table : previous ] , which demonstrate that most previous surveys ( as well as our own ) have measured velocity dispersions significantly higher than those predicted from the model .",
    "the mean velocity distributions for both slomass and the besanon model are shown in figure [ fig : mean_comp ] .",
    "again , the model in general performs well , but there are evident systematic differences .",
    "the mean @xmath46 velocities predicted for the thin disk by the model are systematically high , and the thick disk @xmath46 velocities diverge at large galactic heights .",
    "the first difference may be attributed to our chosen solar motion values ( 10 , 5 , 7 km s@xmath16 ; @xcite ) . a larger adopted value of @xmath50 , such as the classic value of 12 km s@xmath16 @xcite , would move the mean velocities towards agreement .",
    "the discrepancy in the thick disk @xmath46 velocities is probably due to small number statistics , as seen in figure [ fig : vert ] .     and distance distributions of the stars in slomass ( solid line ) and a sampled model ( dashed line ) .",
    "note the agreement between the two datasets , indicating that we are sampling each instance of the besanon model in a manner consistent with the spectroscopic observations in slomass . ]     and @xmath43 velocities for pure thin disk ( shaded line ) and thin + thick models ( solid line ) in the 1200 @xmath11 @xmath44 @xmath11 1300 pc bin .",
    "this height bin corresponds to the slomass data shown in figure [ fig : uvwcdf ] .",
    "note that when the thick disk is added to the distribution , the overall slope increases , and the wing components are enhanced , as seen in the @xmath43 probability plot .",
    "the combined thin and thick disk velocity distributions are also necessary to match the two - component structure seen in the slomass probability plots . ]              in order to examine observable differences between m dwarf members of the thin and thick disks , we kinematically separated the sample using the method of .",
    "this technique selects outliers in the wings of the three - dimensional gaussian velocity distribution , and computes the probability of these stars belonging to the thick disk .",
    "the thin and thick disk populations were characterized by the velocity dispersions in . in order to minimize systematics ,",
    "the @xmath2 velocities were re - computed using distances determined with the spectroscopic parallax relations of @xcite , as described above in  [ sec : specparallax ] .",
    "thus , @xmath2 should not _ a priori _ vary systematically with color .",
    "this also limits the analysis to the 6577 m dwarfs in the sample .",
    "the exact formation mechanism of the thick disk is uncertain ( see and references therein ) , but there is evidence that the mean metallicity of the thick disk is lower than that of the thin disk .",

    "proxies of metallicity have been employed @xcite .",
    "these previous studies have used the low - resolution molecular band indices ( cah1 , cah2 , cah3 , and tio5 ) defined in @xcite to roughly discriminate between solar - metallicity , subdwarf ( [ @xmath51 @xmath0 -1.2 ) and extreme - subdwarf ( [ @xmath51 @xmath0 -2 ) populations . adapting the methods of @xcite and @xcite we computed the ratio ( cah2 + cah3 ) / tio5 for each star in the sample , which varies such that a larger value indicates a higher metallicity . the mean ratio for each spectral type for the thin and thick disk populations",
    "is shown in figure [ fig : metals ] .",
    "the two populations do not separate within the errors , suggesting that the observed metallicity distributions do not differ greatly .",
    "1 dex ) in metallicity . ]      a lower mean metallicity could also manifest itself as a color shift at a given spectral type .",
    "specifically , @xcite showed that at a given @xmath31 or @xmath29 color , low metallicity subdwarfs ( [ @xmath51 @xmath52 ) were redder in @xmath53 .",
    "after slomass was kinematically separated , the mean @xmath54 and @xmath29 colors of the thin and thick disk stars were computed at each spectral subtype , as shown in figure [ fig : colors ] .",
    "there are no significant color differences between the thin and thick disks at a given spectral type .",
    "this further suggests that the slomass stars are not probing a large spread in metallicity .",
    "colors as a function of spectral type for the thin ( open squares ) and thick ( crosses ) disk populations .",
    "the colors of both populations agree within the errors , suggesting that the m dwarfs in slomass do not cover a large metallicity range . ]      finally , if the thick disk is an older system ( as suggested by its hotter kinematics ) , it should possess a lower fraction of active stars @xcite .",
    "the chromospheric activity timescale varies with mass , such that higher mass stars lose their activity sooner ( after @xmath0 1 gyr ) than their low - mass counterparts ( @xmath0 10 gyr ) . to observationally quantify chromospheric activity , the h@xmath5 equivalent width ( ew )",
    "is measured for each m dwarf .",
    "we employed the technique introduced in @xcite and described in @xcite , selecting chromospherically active and inactive stars at each spectral type .",
    "to be classified as active , a star must have an ew of 1  , and pass additional signal - to - noise and error tests described in @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : activity ] shows the active fraction of stars as a function of spectral type for both disk populations . while most early - type m dwarfs ( m0-m3 ) lose their activity quite rapidly , the later types ( m5 ) possess smaller active fractions in the thick disk , and exhibit the expected behavior of older systems . however , these results are only suggestive , as populations older than @xmath0 4 gyr require m dwarfs with types later than m5 in order to be effective probes of the age @xcite .",
    "the milky way ( along with other spiral galaxies ) is evidently a composite of a few major smooth components ( the thin and thick disks and the halo ) and many smaller structures , such as the tidal debris streams from the sagittarius dwarf galaxy . using spectra , proper motions and photometry along one galactic sight - line",
    ", we studied the kinematic and structural distributions of the smooth thin and thick disks as a function of vertical distance from the plane .",
    "we fit two - component gaussians to the @xmath2 distributions as a function of height , placing new constraints on the thin and thick disk velocity dispersions .",
    "this sample was then employed to test the predictions of current galactic models .",
    "the besanon model was chosen for comparison , since it is widely accepted as a standard and models the kinematics of stellar populations .",
    "we generated a suite of 25 models , and each model was sampled to be consistent with the colors and distance distribution of slomass .",
    "the bulk kinematic properties of the data and model were compared .",
    "they agree to @xmath0 10 km s@xmath16 , placing a limit on the accuracy of model predictions .",
    "however , @xmath48 is poorly fit by the model , suggesting that further investigation into modeling the kinematics of the thin and thick disks is necessary .",
    "in particular , the age - velocity dispersion plays an important role in the kinematic predictions , and a more exact definition of this relation is required .",
    "slomass was divided kinematically , assigning membership of each star to either the thin or thick disk .",
    "we inspected the two populations as functions of spectral type , searching for observable differences in the metallicity , colors and chromospheric activity .",
    "while there was little observed difference between the metallicity and color distributions , the activity fraction distribution suggests that the thick disk displays an activity level consistent with an older population , although this result is purely suggestive and needs to be re - examined with later spectral types .",
    "the lack of a strong observable signal may have several causes .",
    "primarily , kinematic separation of populations is not perfect , as stars with extreme kinematics in one population ( i.e. the thin disk ) can masquerade as members of the other population .",
    "this would dilute observable differences , and in our case , the more numerous thin disk population may be polluting the thick disk sample , despite our best efforts to minimize this effect .",
    "secondly , the intrinsic properties ( i.e. metallicity ) of the stars that compose the thin and thick disks are drawn from overlapping distributions .",
    "stars that are at the edges of these distributions would also blur the distinction among observable properties , clouding the best efforts of the observer .",
    "further investigations using stellar tracers along the entire main sequence should alleviate some of these issues .",
