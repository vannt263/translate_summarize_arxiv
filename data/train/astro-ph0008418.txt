    "this paper reports the main results of the efar project , which has measured the peculiar motions of clusters of galaxies in two large volumes at distances between 6000 and 15000 .",
    "the project was initiated in the wake of early studies of peculiar motions which found large - scale coherent flows over significant volumes of the local universe ( dressler  1987 , lynden - bell  1988 ) .",
    "the primary goal of the efar project was to test whether such large coherent motions were to be found outside the local volume within 6000 . in the following years , the velocity field within",
    "6000  has been mapped by several methods and in increasing detail so that today there is fair agreement on the main features of the motions ( recent results are given in giovanelli  1998a , b , dekel  1999 , courteau  2000 , riess 2000 , da costa  2000 , wegner  2000 and tonry 2000 ; see also the review by dekel 2000 ) .",
    "the bulk velocity within this volume , and its convergence towards the frame of reference defined by the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , appear to be consistent with the broad range of currently - acceptable cosmological models ( dekel 2000 , hudson  2000 ) .    however on larger scales",
    "there have been measurements of bulk motions which , at face value , appear much greater than any acceptable model would predict .",
    "the first of these was the measurement by lauer & postman ( 1994 ) , using brightest cluster galaxies , of a bulk motion of @xmath0700  towards @xmath1@xmath2(340,@xmath3 ) for a complete sample of abell clusters out to 15000 .",
    "more recently , large motions have been also be obtained for two smaller samples of clusters at similar distances , for which peculiar velocities have been measured by the more precise fundamental plane and tully - fisher estimators : hudson  ( 1999 ) find a motion of 630@xmath4200  towards @xmath1=(260,@xmath51 ) for the smac sample of 56 clusters at a mean distance of @xmath08000 ; willick ( 1999 ) finds a motion of 720@xmath4280  towards @xmath1=(272,@xmath610 ) for the lp10k sample of 15 clusters at very similar distances .",
    "these two motions are in good agreement with each other , but are nearly orthogonal to the lauer & postman motion ( though similar in amplitude ) .",
    "in contrast , the other extant study of peculiar motions on scales greater than 6000 , the scii tully - fisher survey of dale  ( 1999a ) , finds a bulk flow of less than 200  for a sample 52 abell clusters with a mean distance of @xmath011000 .    at",
    "these scales the robust prediction of most cosmological models is that the bulk motion should be less than 300  with about 95% confidence .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to determine whether there really are large coherent motions on scales of @xmath010000 .",
    "the efar peculiar motion survey probes the velocity field in the hercules - corona borealis and perseus - pisces - cetus regions , which are almost diametrically opposed on the sky and lie close to the axis of the bulk motion found by lauer & postman . with 84 clusters in these two regions extending out to @xmath015000 , the efar sample is well - suited to testing for this particular bulk motion .",
    "conversely , however , it is not well - suited to testing for a bulk motion in the direction found for the smac and lp10k samples , which is almost orthogonal to the major axis of the efar sample .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to determine the peculiar motions of the efar clusters and the consistency of the bulk motion of the sample with both theory and other bulk motion measurements on similar scales .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in  2 we summarise the main features of the data presented in papers  i  iv of this series . in ",
    "3 we describe the maximum likelihood gaussian algorithm developed in paper  iv , which is used to determine the parameters of the fundamental plane and obtain the distances and peculiar velocities for the clusters . in ",
    "4 we derive the best - fitting fundamental plane and critically examine the random and systematic uncertainties in the fitted parameters . in  5 we derive the distances and peculiar velocities for the clusters , testing them for possible systematic biases and comparing them to the peculiar velocities obtained by other authors for the same clusters . in ",
    "6 we determine the bulk motion of the sample and compare it , using a variety of methods , to the results of other studies and to theoretical expectations .",
    "our conclusions are given in  7 .",
    "we use @xmath7=50kms@xmath8mpc and @xmath9=0.5 unless otherwise specified .",
    "all redshifts and peculiar velocities are given in the cmb frame of reference .",
    "earlier papers in this series have described in detail the selection of the clusters and galaxies in the efar sample ( wegner  1996 , paper  i ) , the spectroscopic data ( wegner  1999 , paper  ii ; colless  1999 , paper  v ) , the photoelectric and ccd photometry ( saglia  1997a , paper  iii ; colless  1993 ) and the photometric fitting procedures ( saglia  1997b , paper  iv ; saglia  1993 ) . in this section",
    "we briefly summarise the main properties of the efar database .",
    "the clusters of galaxies in the efar sample are selected in two large , distant ( i.e.  non - local ) volumes : hercules - corona borealis ( hcb , 40 clusters , including coma ) and perseus - pisces - cetus ( ppc , 45 clusters ) .",
    "these regions were chosen because they contain two of the richest supercluster complexes ( excluding the great attractor / shapley supercluster region ) within 20000 .",
    "the clusters come from the aco catalogue ( abell  1989 ) , the list of jackson ( 1982 ) and from scans of sky survey prints by the authors .",
    "the nominal redshift range spanned by the clusters is 6000@xmath10@xmath11@xmath1015000 .",
    "the distribution of the efar clusters on the sky is shown in figure  2 of paper  i ; their distribution with respect to the major supercluster complexes is shown in figure  3 of paper  i.    galaxies were selected in each cluster for their apparently elliptical morphology on sky survey prints , and for large apparent diameter .",
    "the total sample includes 736 early - type galaxies in the 85 clusters .",
    "apparent diameters were measured visually for all early - type galaxies in the cluster fields .",
    "the range in apparent visual diameter ( @xmath12 ) is from about 10  arcsec to over 60  arcsec .",
    "the sample selection function is defined in terms of these visual diameters ; in total , @xmath12 was measured for 2185 early - type galaxies in the cluster fields .",
    "selection functions are determined separately for each cluster , and are approximated by error functions in @xmath13 .",
    "the mean value of the visual diameter is @xmath14=1.3 ( i.e.  20  arcsec ) , and the dispersion in @xmath13 is 0.3  dex ( see paper  i ) .",
    "we obtained 1319 spectra for 714 of the galaxies in our sample , measuring redshifts , velocity dispersions and the  and  lick linestrength indices ( paper  ii ) .",
    "there are one or more repeat observations for 45% of the sample .",
    "the measurements from different observing runs are calibrated to a common zeropoint or scale before being combined , yielding a total of 706 redshifts , 676 velocity dispersions , 676  linestrengths and 582  linestrengths .",
    "the median estimated errors in the combined measurements are @xmath15=20 , @xmath16=9.1% , @xmath17=7.2% and @xmath18=0.015  mag .",
    "comparison of our measurements with published datasets shows no systematic errors in the redshifts or velocity dispersions and only small zeropoint corrections to bring our linestrengths onto the standard lick system .",
    "we have assigned sample galaxies to our target clusters ( or to fore / background clusters ) by examining both the line - of - sight velocity distributions and the projected distributions on the sky ( paper  ii ) .",
    "the velocity distributions were based on efar and zcat ( huchra  1992 ) redshifts for galaxies within 3  of the cluster centres .",
    "these samples were also used to derive mean redshifts and velocity dispersions for the clusters .",
    "the original selection was effective in choosing cluster members , with 88% of the galaxies with redshifts being members of sample clusters and only 12% lying in fore / background clusters or the field .",
    "the median number of galaxies per cluster is 6 .",
    "we obtained r - band ccd photometry for 776 galaxies ( paper  iii ) and b and r photoelectric photometry for 352 galaxies ( colless  1993 ) .",
    "comparison of the ccd and photoelectric photometry shows that we have achieved a common zero - point to better than 1% , and a photometric precision of better than 0.03  mag per measurement .",
    "circularised galaxy light profiles were fitted with seeing - convolved models having both an @xmath19 bulge and an exponential disk ( paper  iv ) .",
    "we find that only 14% of the galaxies in our sample are well fitted by pure @xmath19 bulges and only about 1% by pure exponential disks , with most of the sample requiring both components to achieve a good fit . from these fits",
    "we derive total r - band magnitudes @xmath20 , @xmath21 diameters ( at 20.5  mag  arcsec@xmath22 ) , half - luminosity radii @xmath23 , and average effective surface brightnesses , for 762 galaxies .",
    "the total r magnitudes span the range @xmath20=10.616.0 ( @xmath24=13.85 ) , the diameters span @xmath21=4.890  arcsec ( @xmath25=20  arcsec ) , and the effective radii @xmath23 span 1.671  arcsec ( @xmath26=6.9  arcsec ) . for 90% of our sample",
    "the precision of the total magnitudes and half - luminosity radii is better than 0.15  mag and 25% respectively .",
    "the errors on the combined quantity @xmath27 which enters the fundamental plane equation are always smaller than 0.03  dex .",
    "the visual selection diameters @xmath12 correlate well with the @xmath21 diameters ( or , equivalently , with the fundamental plane quantity ) .",
    "the morphological type classifications of the galaxies , based on all the information available to us , reveal that 31% of the sample objects , visually selected from photographic images to be of early type , are in fact spiral or barred galaxies .",
    "the 69% of galaxies classified as early - type can be subdivided into 8% cd galaxies , 12% e galaxies ( best - fit by a pure @xmath19 profile ) , and 48% e / s0 galaxies ( best - fit by a disk plus bulge model ) .",
    "all the efar project data is available from nasa s astrophysical data centre ( http://adc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) and the centre de donnes astronomiques de strasbourg ( http//:cdsweb.u - strasbg.fr ) .",
    "a summary table with all the main parameters for every galaxy in the efar sample is available at these locations as j / mnras/_vol_/_page_. the contents of the summary table are described here in table  [ tab : efardata ] .    [ cols= \" > , <",
    ", < \" , ]      +   +      gibbons  ( 2000 ) have suggested that the large peculiar velocities found for some clusters are due to poor fp fits . for a heterogeneous sample of 20 clusters drawn from their own observations and the literature ,",
    "they find that nearly half are poorly - fit by a fp and have twice the rms scatter of the well - fit clusters .",
    "the half of their clusters that have good fp fits all have peculiar velocities that are consistent with them being at rest in the cmb frame ; the poorly - fit clusters show a much larger range of peculiar velocities .",
    "gibbons suggest that the large peculiar velocities detected for some clusters may result from those clusters being poorly fit ( for whatever reason ) by the global fp .",
    "the origin of the poor fits is not known , but the possibilities include intrinsic fp variations between clusters , failure to identify and remove interlopers , observational errors , the heterogeneity of the data , and combinations of these effects .",
    "we therefore need to test whether some of the peculiar velocities we derive from the efar dataset are due to poor fits to the fp rather than genuine peculiar velocities .",
    "figure  [ fig : mergechi2 ] shows the peculiar velocities of the efar clusters as a function of the goodness - of - fit of their best - fit fp ( as measured by the reduced @xmath28 statistic ) . as noted above , even after removing outliers , there are still three clusters with very poor fp fits ( @xmath29@xmath303 ; in fact can  2=a85 actually has @xmath29=11 , but is plotted at @xmath29=5 for convenience ) .",
    "all three of these clusters have large negative peculiar velocities , detected at nominal significance levels of 1.82.5@xmath31 .",
    "the poor quality of the fp fits raises considerable doubts about the reality of the peculiar velocity estimates , however , and we therefore omit these clusters from all subsequent analysis .",
    "the remaining clusters generally have acceptable fits ( @xmath29@xmath21 ) .",
    "there are 10 clusters with @xmath29=23 , but none of these have significant peculiar velocities ( the strongest detection is at the 1.8@xmath31 level ) . apart from the three clusters with @xmath29@xmath303 , the clusters are all adequately fitted by the global fp , and there is no evidence for any increased scatter in the peculiar velocities for poorer fp fits .",
    "=    another possible source of systematic errors are the small biases in the recovered parameters of the best - fitting fp ( see  [ fp ] above ) . if we apply the corrections for these biases derived from our simulations ( figure  [ fig : simresults ] ) and re - derive the peculiar velocities with this bias - corrected fp , we find that the peculiar velocities of the clusters are not significantly altered : the peculiar velocity of coma changes by + 14 , and the rms difference in peculiar velocity between our standard solution and the bias - corrected solution is only 67 .    we can also attempt to test whether differences in the mean stellar populations between clusters produce spurious peculiar velocities , by looking for a correlation between the peculiar velocities and the offset of each cluster from the global mg@xmath31 relation derived in paper  v. the correlation coefficient for the distribution ( shown in figure  [ fig : dmgdfp ] ) is @xmath50.30 , but 1000 simulations of the observed distribution show that , allowing for the estimated errors , this value does not indicate a correlation significant at the 95% level .",
    "however , while there is no positive evidence that stellar population differences are leading to spurious peculiar velocities , this test can not rule out this possibility .",
    "figure  10 of paper  v shows that the joint distribution of residuals about the fp and mg@xmath31 relations is consistent with simple stellar population models if one invokes sufficiently large ( and possibly correlated ) scatter in the ages and metallicities of the galaxies . against this possibility",
    "we can set the generally good agreement between the distance estimates obtained from the fp and other methods ( such as the tully - fisher relation and surface brightness fluctuations ) which have different dependences on the stellar populations .",
    "=    finally , we can perform a direct comparison between the peculiar velocities we measure and those obtained by other groups for the same clusters .",
    "figure  [ fig : vcomp ] shows comparisons with the tully - fisher estimates of giovanelli  ( 1998b ; sci ) and dale  ( 1999b ; scii ) , and the fp estimates of hudson  ( 1997 ; smac ) and gibbons ( 2000 ; gfb ) .",
    "the flattening in the @xmath32@xmath33 distributions is due to the fact that the uncertainties in the efar peculiar velocities are generally larger than those of the other measurements  although the error per galaxy is similar in all cases , the efar sample typically has a smaller number of galaxies per cluster .",
    "a @xmath28-test shows that the peculiar velocity measurements are consistent within the errors in all three comparisons .",
    "in analysing the peculiar motions of the clusters in the efar sample we confine ourselves to the subsample of clusters with 3 or more galaxies ( @xmath34@xmath353 ) , @xmath11@xmath3615000  and @xmath37@xmath361800 .",
    "these criteria are illustrated in figure  [ fig : pvsel ] , and are chosen because : ( i )  they eliminate all the fore- and background clusters , for which the selection functions have not been directly measured and are only poorly approximated by the selection function of the main cluster onto which they are projected ; ( ii )  they eliminate the clusters with only 1 or 2 galaxies in the fp fit , where it is not possible to check if galaxies are cluster interlopers or fp outliers ; ( iii )  they eliminate the higher - redshift clusters , which have proportionally higher uncertainties in their peculiar velocities ( and in any case sample the volume beyond @xmath11=15000  too sparsely to be useful ) ; ( iv )  they eliminate clusters with large uncertainties in their peculiar velocities , resulting from large measurement errors for individual galaxies exacerbated by a small number of galaxies in the cluster  restricting the subsample to @xmath37@xmath361800  ( the peculiar velocity error for a cluster with a fp distance from 3 galaxies with a distance error per galaxy of 20% ) represents a compromise between using clusters with better - determined peculiar velocities and keeping the largest possible cluster sample .    =    we also eliminate from the sample the three clusters which were identified in the previous section as having unacceptably poor fp fits ( can  2=a85 , can  55=p386 - 2 and can  79=a2589 ) ; two of these would be eliminated in any case : a85 because it has @xmath11@xmath3015000 , and p386 - 2 because it has only two galaxies .",
    "we also eliminate the two components of a548 ( can  35=a548 - 1 and can  36=a548 - 2 ) , since the substructure in this region ( zabludoff  1993 , davis  1995 ) makes cluster membership problematic and since the high relative velocity of the two main subclusters is not relevant to the large - scale motions we are investigating ( watkins 1997 ) .",
    "the subsample selected in this way for the analysis of the peculiar motions comprises 50 clusters ( 25 in hcb , 25 in ppc ) ; they are indicated by an asterisk in table  [ tab : efarpv ] .",
    "the distribution of the peculiar velocity uncertainties for this subsample is shown in the inset to figure  [ fig : pvsel ] ) ; the median peculiar velocity error is 1060 .",
    "figure  [ fig : pvsky ] shows the projection of the sample on the sky in galactic coordinates , with the amplitude of the clusters peculiar velocities in the cmb frame indicated by the size of the symbols .",
    "inflowing clusters ( circles ) and outflowing clusters ( asterisks ) are fairly evenly distributed over the survey regions .",
    "the median direction of the clusters belonging to the peculiar velocity sample in the hcb region is ( @xmath38,@xmath39)=(42,48 ) , and in the ppc region is ( @xmath38,@xmath39)=(152,-36 ) ; the angle between these two directions is 128 .",
    "=      the peculiar velocities of the sample clusters as a function of redshift are shown in figure  [ fig : pvcz ] .",
    "the mean peculiar velocity of the whole sample ( @xmath40=159@xmath4158 ) is consistent , within the errors , with no net inflow or outflow .",
    "this need not have been the case , as the fp zeropoint is based on the 29 clusters listed in table  [ tab : fpclus ] , which make up only 26 of the 50 clusters in the peculiar velocity sample .",
    "the mean peculiar velocities of each of the two sample regions separately are also consistent with zero inflow or outflow : @xmath41=@xmath6383@xmath4229 ; @xmath42=@xmath565@xmath4217 . a @xmath28 test shows that the observed peculiar velocities are consistent with strictly zero motions ( i.e.  no bulk or random motions at all ) at the 2% level .",
    "if the one cluster with a 3@xmath31 peculiar velocity detection ( j19 , can=59 ) is omitted , this rises to 8% .",
    "if the peculiar velocity errors were under - estimated by 5% ( 10% ) , then the fit is consistent at the 6% ( 15% ) level . if random thermal motions with an rms of 250(500 ) are assumed , then the fit is consistent at the 5% ( 30% ) level .",
    "there is , therefore , no evidence in the efar sample for significant bulk motions in the hcb or ppc volumes .",
    "=    the components in supergalactic coordinates of the mean peculiar velocity in redshift shells are shown in figure  [ fig : pvbin ] .",
    "there is no sign of any trend with redshift in the mean peculiar velocity , either for the whole sample or for the two regions separately .",
    "none of the components of the mean peculiar velocity are significant in any redshift bin apart from the 1200013000  bin in hcb , which is due to j19 ( can=59)cf .  figure  [ fig : pvcz ] .",
    "=    we can estimate the intrinsic dispersion of the peculiar velocity field using the maximum likelihood approach described in paper  vi ( see section  2.1 and appendix  a ; cf .",

    "the upper panels of figure  [ fig : rmslike ] show the distributions of peculiar velocities , both radially and in supergalactic coordinates , for the hcb and ppc regions separately and for the whole sample .",
    "the peculiar velocities in all cases have means close to zero , and the question is how large an intrinsic dispersion is required , combined with the observational uncertainties , to reproduce the observed scatter in the peculiar velocities .",
    "the lower panels of figure  [ fig : rmslike ] show the relative likelihood , @xmath43 , as a function of the assumed intrinsic dispersion .",
    "the most likely estimate of the three - dimensional velocity dispersion for the whole sample is about 600 , but the 1@xmath31 range is 01200 .",
    "the most likely dispersions for the hcb and ppc regions separately are about 300  and 700  respectively .",
    "hence the intrinsic dispersion of the clusters peculiar velocities is not well - determined by this data , due to the large uncertainties in the observed peculiar velocities .",
    "=      a comparison of the efar bulk motion to other measurements of bulk motions on various scales , and to theoretical predictions , is given in figure  [ fig : pvscale ] .",
    "the figure shows the reported bulk motions from a number of other observational studies as a function of the effective scale of the sample .",
    "also shown is the theoretical prediction for the bulk motion measured with a top - hat window function of radius @xmath44 ( in h@xmath8mpc ) for a fairly ` standard ' flat @xmath45cdm cosmology having a power spectrum with shape parameter @xmath46=0.25 , normalisation @xmath47=1.0 and hubble constant @xmath48=0.7 ( corresponding to @xmath49=0.36 and @xmath50=0.64 ; see , e.g. , coles & lucchin 1995 , p.399 ) .",
    "=    this comparison is limited by a number of factors : ( i )  the finite , sparse and non - uniform observed samples do not have top - hat window functions , and their effective scales @xmath44 are not well - defined ( compare this figure with the similar figure in dekel ( 2000 ) ) ; this uncertainty is ameliorated by the slow decrease in the expected bulk motion with scale .",
    "( ii )  only the amplitudes of the bulk motions are compared , and not the directions ; however , the observed bulk motions that are significantly different from zero have a common direction to within about 30 , close to the direction of the cmb dipole . ( iii )  the uncertainties in the measured bulk motions are only crudely estimated in some studies , and ignore or under - estimate the systematic biases . despite these limitations , the figure does show that , allowing for both observational uncertainties and cosmic variance , the measured bulk motions are in most cases quite consistent with the theoretical predictions ( which vary relatively little for any model that is consistent with the currently - accepted ranges of the cosmological parameters ) . in this section and the next we determine the extent to which the efar results are consistent with the models and with the possibly - discrepant results of lauer & postman ( 1994 ; acif ) and hudson  ( 1999 ; smac ) . the bulk flow obtained by willick ( 1999 ;",
    "lp10k ) is similar to the smac result , and is not considered explicitly .",
    "we can test whether the observed efar peculiar velocity field is consistent with the bulk motions claimed by other authors .",
    "the bulk motion of the lauer & postman ( 1994 ) cluster sample in the cmb frame , based on brightest cluster galaxy distances as re - analysed by colless ( 1995 ) , is 764  in the direction ( @xmath38,@xmath39)=(341,49 ) .",
    "this direction is only 39  from the median direction of the hcb clusters in the efar sample , and its antipole is just 15  from the median direction of the ppc clusters . consequently the efar sample is able to provide a strong test of the existence of the lauer & postman bulk motion .",
    "figure  [ fig : complpsmac]a shows the peculiar velocities of the efar sample as a function of the cosine of their angle with respect to the direction of the lauer & postman dipole .",
    "the best - fit bulk flow in the lauer & postman direction has @xmath51=250@xmath4209 , and is consistent with zero at the 1.2@xmath31 level .",
    "a @xmath28  test finds that a pure lauer & postman bulk motion of 764  in this direction is consistent with the data at only the 0.2% level .",
    "=    the bulk motion of the smac sample , for which peculiar velocities are derived from fp distances by hudson  ( 1999 ) , is 630  in the direction ( @xmath38,@xmath39)=(260,@xmath51 ) .",
    "the median direction of the hcb clusters is 57  from the antipole of this motion , and the median direction of the ppc clusters is 76  from the antipole . hence the efar sample is less well - suited to testing for bulk motions in this direction .",
    "nonetheless , the formal rejection of the smac motion is even stronger than for the lauer & postman motion . figure  [ fig : complpsmac]b shows the peculiar velocities of the efar sample as a function of the cosine of their angle with respect to the smac dipole .",
    "the best - fit bulk flow along the smac direction has @xmath51=@xmath5536@xmath4330  ( i.e.  in the opposite direction ) , and is consistent with zero bulk motion at the 1.6@xmath31 level .",
    "a @xmath28  test finds that a pure smac bulk motion of 630  in this direction is consistent with the data at only the 0.04% level .",
    "it is worth noting that an observed bulk flow amplitude of zero would be consistent with the lauer & postman flow at less than the 0.2% level , but consistent with the smac flow at the 3.2% level  if the real bulk flow is small , therefore , the apparently high significance of the rejection of the smac flow may be the result of the large uncertainty in the observed amplitude of the flow .",
    "these @xmath28  tests do not take into account the correlated errors in the peculiar velocity estimates .",
    "we therefore carry out monte carlo simulations of the efar dataset , including the effects of the correlated errors , in order to check the consistency of the observed peculiar velocities with the claimed bulk flows of lauer & postman ( lp ) and hudson  ( smac ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : simflows ] shows the distributions of the bulk flow amplitudes recovered from 500 simulations of the lp and smac bulk motions .",
    "the mean values of the recovered bulk flow amplitude ( @xmath52 ) are very close to the true values ( @xmath53 or @xmath54 ) , although in each case there is a small but statistically significant bias .",
    "however the value of the bulk flow amplitude derived from the actual efar dataset ( @xmath55 ) is in both cases far out on the wing of the distribution : only one of the 500 simulations of the lauer & postman flow , and none of the 500 simulations of the smac flow , yields a bulk flow amplitude less than the observed value .",
    "hence the observations are consistent with a pure lauer & postman bulk flow only at the 0.2% level , and with a pure smac bulk flow at less than the 0.2% level .",
    "the correlated errors in the peculiar velocities do not significantly alter the results obtained from the @xmath28  tests .",
    "=      the above comparisons assume pure bulk flows and ignore the greater complexity of the real velocity field .",
    "we can make more realistic comparisons if we adopt a more detailed model for the velocity field . in principle",
    "this approach also allows us to use the observed peculiar velocities to discriminate between different cosmological models .",
    "the velocity field models are characterised by a mass power spectrum , which determines the velocity field on large scales where the dynamics are linear , and a small - scale rms ` thermal ' motion , @xmath56 , which approximates the effects of non - linear dynamics on small scales .",
    "given such a model , the method for computing the expected bulk flow in a particular sample , and for estimating the probability of an observed bulk flow , has been developed by kaiser ( 1988 ) and feldman & watkins ( 1994 , 1998 ) .",
    "as shown by feldman & watkins ( 1994 ) , the covariance matrix for the maximum likelihood estimator of the bulk flow in a sample is given by the sum of a ` noise ' term , which depends on the spatial distribution of the clusters , the errors in their peculiar velocities and the thermal rms motions , and a ` velocity ' term , which also depends on the power spectrum of the assumed cosmological model .",
    "we adopt a thermal rms motion of @xmath56=250 .",
    "although this value is not well - determined it has little effect on the results ( as we show below ) , since it enters in quadrature sum with the uncertainties on the cluster peculiar velocities , which are generally much larger ( see table  [ tab : efarpv ] ) .",
    "our adopted cosmological model has a cdm - like power spectrum with @xmath46=0.25 and @xmath47=1.0 , consistent with the power spectrum measured from the apm galaxy survey ( baugh & efstathiou 1993 ) and the pscz redshift survey ( sutherland  1999 ) .",
    "this corresponds to the currently - favoured flat @xmath45cdm cosmology with @xmath7@xmath270kms@xmath8mpc@xmath8 , @xmath49@xmath20.35 and @xmath50@xmath20.65 .",
    "the survey s sensitivity to the power spectrum is determined by its window function .",
    "figure  [ fig : pkwk]a shows the window function for the efar sample along the supergalactic x , y and z axes ; the y axis in particular shows the effect of correlated errors resulting from not having a full - sky sample .",
    "the model power spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig : pkwk]b .",
    "the product of the power spectrum and the window function , shown in figure  [ fig : pkwk]c , gives the relative contributions of different scales to the covariance in the measured bulk velocity .",
    "the bulk velocity depends on a broad range of scales , with the largest contributions coming from scales of a few hundred h@xmath8mpc .",

    ", @xmath64 is the ` noise ' covariance matrix , @xmath65 is the @xmath66th component of the unit vector of the @xmath67th cluster , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the cluster s peculiar velocity and its uncertainty , and @xmath56 is the assumed rms thermal motion of the model . for the efar sample ,",
    "the maximum likelihood bulk flow vector in supergalactic coordinates is ( @xmath524 , @xmath56 , @xmath6717 ) , almost entirely in the sgz axis . in galactic",
    "coordinates this is 718  in the direction ( @xmath38,@xmath39)=(45.4,@xmath65.9 ) .",
    "however this formal result is rather ill - determined , since it is far from the main axis of the efar sample ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : pvsky ] ) .",
    "an indication of the uncertainty can be obtained by ignoring the cross - correlations in the covariance matrix and estimating the rms error as @xmath70=505 . in the context of the assumed cosmological model",
    ", the probability of measuring a bulk flow vector @xmath60 can be obtained by computing the @xmath28 statistic from the covariance matrix as @xmath71 the probability ( given the cosmological model and the properties of the sample ) of observing a bulk flow with a value of @xmath28 greater than this is given by the appropriate integral over the @xmath28 distribution with 3 degrees of freedom ( the 3 components of @xmath60 ) .",
    "for the efar sample this procedure yields @xmath28=6.1 with 3 degrees of freedom , and hence the observed bulk flow is consistent with the model at the 11% confidence level . if the rms thermal motion @xmath56 is set to be zero rather than 250 , the observations are still consistent with the model at the 9% confidence level .",
    "the expectation value for the bulk motion ( given the cosmological model and the properties of the sample ) can be obtained as @xmath72 where @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the lengths of the axes of the covariance ellipsoid obtained from the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix .",
    "the directions of these axes are given by the ( orthogonal ) eigenvectors of the covariance matrix .",
    "for the efar sample and our adopted cosmological model , these eigenvalues and eigenvectors ( in supergalactic coordinates ) are @xmath76 the corresponding directions in galactic coordinates are @xmath77=(172.6,@xmath630.6 ) , @xmath78=(82.0,@xmath61.2 ) , and @xmath79=(350.0,@xmath659.4 ) .",
    "we therefore find an expectation value for the amplitude of the bulk flow of 619 , so that the observed value is not much larger than that expected from our model , as the @xmath28 statistic indicates .",
    "it is worth noting that the expected bulk flow amplitude is strongly dominated by the ` noise ' term in the covariance matrix . for our adopted cosmological model in the absence of noise , we would expect to measure a bulk flow amplitude from the efar sample of only 355 , whereas in the absence of any cosmological velocities , the noise in our measurement would still lead us to expect a bulk flow amplitude of 553 .",
    "we obtain a smaller upper limit on the bulk motion we if consider only the component of the bulk flow along the minimum - variance axis of the covariance ellipsoid .",
    "unsurprisingly , this axis , @xmath79=(350.0,@xmath659.4 ) , is just 20  away from the median axis of the 50 clusters in the peculiar velocity sample , @xmath80=(7,@xmath642 ) .",
    "the expected bulk flow amplitude along this axis is 147  ( 124  from noise alone , 76  from model alone ) , while the maximum likelihood estimate of the observed bulk motion is 269 .",
    "since @xmath75=185 , this gives @xmath28=2.11 with 1 degree of freedom , implying that the observed bulk motion in this direction is consistent with the model at the 15% confidence level .",
    "thus there is no evidence that the bulk motion of the efar sample is inconsistent with a cosmological model having a cdm - like power spectrum with @xmath46=0.25 and @xmath47=1.0 , consistent with the best current determinations .",
    "in fact , repeating this analysis , we find that the observations are consistent with a wide range of cosmological models , including both standard cdm and open , low - density cdm models",
    ".    we can also ask to what extent the efar sample is capable of testing whether the bulk motions measured by lauer & postman ( 1994 ) , smac ( hudson  1999 ) and lp10k ( willick 1999 ) are consistent with the velocity field model . to do so we use the @xmath28 statistic computed according to equation  [ eqn : chi2vel ] , inserting the efar covariance matrix for @xmath44 and the observed lauer & postman , smac or lp10k bulk motions for @xmath60 .",
    "if the efar bulk motion had been found to be identical to the smac result , it would have been consistent with the velocity field model at the 25% level ; if it had been found to be identical to the lp10k result it would have been consistent with the model at the 9% level .",
    "however a bulk motion identical to the lauer & postman result would have been rejected at the 0.09% level .",
    "hence , as expected , the directionality of the efar sample means that while it would have provided a strong indication of an inconsistency with the model if the lauer & postman result had been recovered , recovery of the smac or lp10k results would not have implied a problem with the model .",
    "we can generalise this analysis to illustrate how the directionality of the efar sample affects the constraints it could place on observed bulk motions in different directions . figure  [ fig : mapchiv ] shows , in each direction on the sky , the amplitude of the observed bulk motion that would be rejected as inconsistent with the velocity field model at the 1% confidence level using equation  [ eqn : chi2vel ] .",
    "=    it is important to emphasise that although it would not have been surprising , under this model , to have recovered the smac motion from the efar sample , in fact the tests of the previous section indicated that the actual motions recovered from the efar sample are highly inconsistent with a pure smac bulk flow .",
    "as already noted , however , because those tests do not use a full velocity field model and do not account for the window function of the sample , they will tend to over - estimate the degree of inconsistency .",
    "the best test is a simultaneous consistency check between both datasets and the model ( watkins & feldman 1995 ) , determining the joint probability of deriving both the observed efar bulk motion from the efar sample and the observed smac motion from the smac sample under the assumptions of the velocity field model .",
    "this type of test has already been carried out for the smac sample with respect to various other samples by hudson  ( 2000 ) , who find consistency with all the other peculiar velocity surveys with the possible exception of lauer & postman , and a marginal conflict with a flat @xmath45cdm model similar to that used here .",
    "once the smac peculiar velocities have been published , a similar test can be carried out to check the consistency of the efar and smac survey results .",
    "we have measured peculiar velocities for 84 clusters of galaxies in two large , almost diametrically opposed , regions at distances between 6000 and 15000 .",
    "these velocities are based on fundamental plane ( fp ) distance estimates for early - type galaxies in each cluster .",
    "we fit the fp to the best - studied 29 clusters using a maximum likelihood algorithm which takes account of both selection effects and measurement errors and yields fp parameters with smaller bias and variance than other fitting procedures .",
    "we obtain a best - fit fp with coefficients consistent with the best existing determinations .",
    "apparent differences in the fps obtained in previous studies can be reconciled by allowing for the biases imposed by the various fitting methods .",
    "we then fix the fp parameters at their best - fit values and derive distances for the whole cluster sample .",
    "the resulting peculiar velocities show no evidence for residual systematic errors , and , for the small numbers of clusters in common , are consistent with those measured by other authors .    we have examined the bulk motion of the sample regions using the 50 clusters with the best - determined peculiar velocities .",
    "we find the bulk motions in both regions are small , and consistent with zero at about the 5% level .",
    "we use both direct @xmath28 comparison and the more sophisticated window function covariance analysis developed by kaiser ( 1988 ) and feldman & watkins ( 1994 , 1998 ) to compare our result with the predictions of standard cosmological models and the results of other studies .",
    "we find that the bulk motion of our sample is consistent ( at about the 10% level ) with the prediction of a @xmath45cdm model with parameters @xmath46=0.25 , @xmath47=1.0 and @xmath48=0.7 ; indeed the motion is consistent with most cosmological models having parameters that are broadly consistent with the observed shape and normalisation of the galaxy power spectrum .",
    "we examine whether our results can be reconciled with the large - amplitude bulk motions on similar scales found in some other studies .",
    "our sample lies close to the direction of the large - amplitude dipole motion claimed by lauer & postman ( 1994 ) , so that we are able to make an effective test of the bulk motion in this direction .",
    "we find that a pure lauer & postman bulk motion is inconsistent with our data at the 0.2% confidence level .",
    "this strong rejection of the lauer & postman result is supported by the window function covariance analysis .",
    "we find an even stronger inconsistency between the efar peculiar velocities and the result of the smac survey ( hudson  1999 ) , with a pure smac bulk motion ruled out at the 0.04% confidence level .",
    "this is a surprisingly strong result , given that the main axis of the efar sample lies at a large angle to the direction of the smac dipole",
    ". it will be important to carry out a simultaneous consistency check of both datasets with a full velocity field model using the generalised covariance analysis described by watkins & feldman ( 1995 ) and hudson  ( 2000 ) .    to summarise current observations of bulk motions on scales larger than 6000 : ( i )  the efar and scii ( dale  1999a ) surveys find small bulk motions , close to the predictions of cosmological models that are constrained to be consistent with other large - scale structure observations .",
    "( ii )  the smac survey ( hudson  1999 ) finds a bulk motion with a much larger amplitude .",
    "however a full accounting for the uncertainties and window function of the survey shows that it is in fact only marginally inconsistent with the models ( at about the 2@xmath31 level ; hudson  2000 ) .",
    "( iii )  the lp10k survey finds a bulk motion very similar to the smac dipole , but the smaller sample size means that the uncertainties are larger and consequently the result is not inconsistent .",
    "( iv )  the lauer & postman ( 1994 ) result _ is _ inconsistent with such models at the 35% level ( feldman & watkins 1994 ) .",
    "however it is also inconsistent with the efar results ( at the 0.2% confidence level ) and with the other surveys combined ( at the 0.6% level ; hudson  2000 ) , and therefore should be treated with reserve .",
    "we conclude that existing measurements of large - scale bulk motions provide no significant evidence against standard models for the formation of structure .",
