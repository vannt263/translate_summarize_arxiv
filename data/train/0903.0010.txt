    "interest rate changes by the federal reserve provide a significant perturbation to financial markets , which we analyze from the perspective of statistical physics @xcite . the federal reserve board ( fed ) , in charge of monetary policy as the central bank of the united states ,",
    "is one of the most influential financial institutions in the world . during federal open market committee ( fomc )",
    "meetings , the fed determines whether or not to change key interest rates .",
    "these interest rates serve as a benchmark and a barometer for both american and international economies .",
    "the publicly released statements from the scheduled fomc meetings provide grounds for widespread speculation in financial markets , often with significant consequences .    in this paper , we show that markets respond sharply to fomc news in a complex way reminiscent of physical earthquakes described by the omori law @xcite . for financial markets ,",
    "the omori law was first observed in market crashes by lillo and mantegna @xcite , followed by a further study of weber _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , which found the same behavior in medium - sized aftershocks .",
    "however , the market crash is only an extreme example of information flow in financial markets .",
    "this paper extends the omori law observed in large financial crises to the more common federal reserve announcements , and suggests that large market news dissipates via power - law relaxation ( omori law ) of the volatility .",
    "in addition to the standard omori dynamics following the announcement , we also find novel omori dynamics before the announcement .",
    "the market dynamics following the release of fomc news are consistent with previous studies of price - discovery in foreign exchange markets following marcroeconomic news releases @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we hypothesize that the uncertainty in fed actions , coupled with the pre - announced schedule of fomc meetings , can increase speculation among market traders , which can lead to the observed market underreaction @xcite .",
    "market underreaction , meaning that markets take a finite time to readjust prices following news , is not consistent with the efficient market hypothesis ; several theories have been proposed to account for this phenomena @xcite .",
    "we analyze all @xmath5 scheduled fomc meetings in the eight - year period 2000 - 2008 using daily data from _ http://finance.yahoo.com_. also , for the two - year period 2001 - 2002 , we analyze the intraday behavior for 19 fomc meetings using trades and quote ( taq ) data on the 1-minute time scale .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : fomc ] we describe the fomc meetings and the fed interest rate relevant to our analysis . in section [ sec : daily ] we analyze the response of the s&p100 , the top 100 stocks ( ranked by 12-month sales according to a 2002 _ businessweek _ report ) belonging to the 2002 s&p 500 index , over the 2000 - 2008 period using daily data . using the relative spread between the 6-month treasury bill and the federal funds effective rate",
    ", we relate the speculation _ prior _ to the fomc meetings to the daily market volatility , measured here as the logarithmic difference between the intraday high and low price for a given stock on the day of the announcement . in section [ sec : intraday ] we study high - frequency intraday taq data on the 1-min scale for the s&p100 , and find an omori law with positive exponent immediately following the announcement of fed rate changes .",
    "further , we relate the intraday market response , ( quantified by both the omori exponent and omori amplitude ) , to the change in market expectations before and after the announcement .",
    "there are many economic indicators that determine the health of the u.s . economy . in turn , the health of the u.s .",
    "economy sets a global standard due to the ubiquity of both the u.s .",
    "dollar and the economic presence maintained through imports , exports , and the _ global _ market @xcite . the u.s .",
    "federal reserve target rate , along with the effective  overnight \" rate , set the scale for interest rates in the united states and abroad .",
    "the target rate is determined at fomc meetings , which are scheduled throughout the year , with detailed minutes publicly released from these meetings .",
    "the effective rate is a `` weighted average of rates on brokered trades '' between the fed and large banks and financial institutions , and is a market realization of the target rate @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ deltaexample ] we plot the federal interest rates over the 8-year period 2000 - 2008 .",
    "our analysis focuses on the fomc meetings after january 2000 .",
    "historically , the methods for releasing the meeting details have varied . in the 1990s",
    ", there was a transition from a very secretive policy towards the current transparent policy @xcite . since the year 2000",
    ", the fed has released statements detailing the views and goals of the fomc .",
    "this increase in public information has led to an era of mass speculation in the markets , revolving mainly around key economic indicators such as the unemployment rate , the consumer price index , the money supply , etc .",
    "these economic indicators also influence the fomc in their decision to either change or maintain key interest rates . as a result of this open policy , the fed has used the  announcement effect \" @xcite to manipulate the federal funds market .",
    "speculation has assumed many forms and new heights , evident in the implementation of new types of derivatives based on federal securities .",
    "for instance , options and futures are available at the chicago board of trade which are based on federal funds , treasury bills , and eurodollar foreign exchange .",
    "these contracts can be used to estimate the implied probability of interest rate changes , utilizing sophisticated methods focussed on the price movement of expiring derivative contracts @xcite .    in the next section",
    ", we outline a simple method to measure speculation prior to a scheduled fomc meeting using the 6-month treasury bill and the federal funds effective (  overnight \" ) rate .",
    "these data are readily available and are updated frequently at the website of the federal reserve @xcite . because each fomc meeting is met with speculation ( in the weeks before the meeting ) and anticipation ( in the hours before the announcement ) , we identify the decision to change or not to change key interest rates as a market perturbation .",
    "the market response results from the systematic stress associated with the speculation and anticipation , which are not always in line with the fomc decision .",
    "in this section we analyze the daily activity before and after 66 _ scheduled _ fomc meetings over the 8-year period 2000 - 2008 , where scheduled meetings are publicly announced at least a year in advance @xcite .",
    "we do not consider unscheduled meetings resulting in rate change , which contain an intrinsic element of surprise , and are historically infrequent ( only 4 unexpected target rate changes over the same period ) .",
    "of primary importance , is the fomc committee s decision to change or not change the target rate @xmath6 by some percent @xmath7 , where the absolute relative change @xmath8 has typically filled the range between @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "this section serves as an initial motivation for the intraday analysis , and will also serve as a guide in developing a metric that captures market speculation .",
    "in this section we use the intraday high - low price range to quantify the magnitude of price fluctuations .",
    "in particular , we analyze the companies belonging to the s&p 100 , and also the subset of 18 banking and finance companies referred to here as the `` bank '' sector .    in fig .",
    "[ deltaexample](a ) we plot @xmath11 , the time series for the 6-month treasury bill , along with @xmath12 , the _ federal funds effective rate _ , and @xmath6 , the _ federal funds target rate _ , over the 8-year period beginning in january 2000 .",
    "the relative difference between the 6-month treasury bill and the federal funds effective rate is an indicator of the future expectations of the federal funds target rate @xcite .",
    "note that the 6-month treasury bill has anticipatory behavior with respect to the federal funds target ( and hence effective ) rates .",
    "other more sophisticated models utilize futures on federal funds and eurodollar exchange , but these markets are rather new , and represent the highly complex nature of contemporary markets and hedging programs @xcite .",
    "hence , we use a simple and intuitive method for estimating market speculation and anticipation by analyzing the relative difference between the 6-month treasury bill and the federal funds effective rate .",
    "[ deltaexample](b ) exhibits the typical interplay between the 6-month t - bill and the federal funds effective rate before and after a fomc meeting .",
    "the change in the value of the effective rate results from market speculation , starting approximately one trading week ( 5 trading days ) prior to the announcement .",
    "this change follows from the forward - looking treasury bill , which in the example in fig .",
    "[ deltaexample](b ) , is priced above the federal funds rate even 15 trading days before the announcement .    in order to quantify speculation and anticipation in the market prior to each scheduled fomc meeting",

    "[ deltaexample](c ) we plot @xmath13 for the 15 days before and after a typical fomc meeting resulting in a rate change . in order to study the speculation preceding the @xmath15 scheduled fomc meeting , we calculate the average relative spread over the @xmath16 day period .",
    "we weight the days in the @xmath17-day period leading up to the fomc meeting day exponentially , such that the relative spread on the @xmath18 day before the announcement has the weight @xmath19 .",
    "without loss of generality , we choose the value of @xmath20 days corresponding to two trading weeks @xcite .",
    "we define the speculation metric , @xmath21 which is a weighted average of @xmath13 before the announcement , where the sums are computed over the range @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "the metric @xmath23 for the @xmath15 fomc meeting can be positive or negative , depending on the market s forward - looking expectations .    in order to quantify the market response to the speculation @xmath23 , we analyze the market volatility around each fomc meeting . for a particular stock around the @xmath15 scheduled fomc meeting , we take the daily high price @xmath24 , and the daily low price @xmath25 , for @xmath26 $ ] , where @xmath27 corresponds to @xmath28 , the day of the meeting .",
    "we then compute the high - low range for each trading day , @xmath29 for each stock and each meeting , we scale the range by @xmath30 , the average range over the 41-day time sequence centered around the meeting day , resulting in the normalized volatility @xmath31 .",
    "similarly , we use @xmath32 , the time series for the volume traded over the same period , to compute a weight for each stock corresponding to the normalized volume on the day of the fomc meeting .",
    "we calculate this weight as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the average daily volume over the 41-day time sequence centered around the @xmath15 meeting day .",
    "we use a volume weight in order to emphasize the price - impact resulting from relatively high trading volume , since there are significant cross - correlations between volume change and price change @xcite .",
    "finally , we compute the weighted average volatility time series over all stocks and all meetings , @xmath35 in fig . [ daily ]",
    "we plot the trend of average daily volatility defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) for the 10 days before and after the scheduled announcements .",
    "we observe a peak in @xmath36 on fomc meeting days , corresponding to @xmath37 , with a more pronounced peak in the bank sector ( fig .",
    "[ daily ] ) .",
    "stocks in the bank sector are strongly impacted by changes in fed rates , which immediately influence both their holding and lending rates . on average",
    "there is a 15 - 20% increase in volatility on days corresponding to fomc meetings .    in order to quantify the impact of a single fomc announcement on day @xmath28",
    ", we define the average market volatility @xmath38 here , @xmath39 and @xmath40 refer to the average and sum over records corresponding only to the day @xmath28 .",
    "again , @xmath41 is a normalized weight , where now @xmath42 is the average daily volume over the entire 8-year period , since we compare many meetings across a large time span .    in fig .",
    "[ thetadaily ] we plot the average volatility @xmath43 of the ( a ) s&p100 and ( b ) the subset of 18 banking stocks versus @xmath23 . for negative values of @xmath23 ,",
    "for which @xmath44 corresponding to an expected rate increase , we observe a less volatile market response .",
    "conversely , for larger positive values of @xmath23 , for which @xmath45 corresponding to a rate cut , there tends to be larger market fluctuations .",
    "hence , the market responds differently to falling and rising rates , where the direction in rate change often reflects the overall health of the economy as viewed by the fomc .",
    "typically , the fomc implements rate increases to fight inflation , whereas rate decreases often follow bad economic news or economic emergency .",
    "hence , our findings are consistent with the empirical  sign effect \" , in which  bad \" news has a greater impact in markets than does  good \" news @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there is also a tendency for large average volatility even when @xmath23 is small , possibly stemming from the extreme surprise characteristic of some fomc decisions . in these cases ,",
    "more sophisticated methods are needed to improve the predictions of market movement .      in the previous section we studied the market response on the daily scale .",
    "now we ask the question , `` what is the intraday response to fomc news ? '' here we analyze the taq data over the 2-year period jan .  1 , 2001 to dec .  31 , 2002 .",
    "the reported times for the fomc announcement are listed in table 1 @xcite .",

    "the impact of macroeconomic news has been analyzed for foreign exchange markets @xcite , where it is found that high levels of volatility are present following both scheduled and surprise news .",
    "according to the efficient market hypothesis @xcite , the time scale over which news is incorporated into prices should be very small .",
    "however , consistent with previous studies , we find  market underreaction \" @xcite evident in the finite time scale ( found here to be at least 1 trading day ) over which the volatility aftershocks are significant .",
    "moreover , we quantify the dynamics before and after , and show that the omori parameters are related to investor sentiment @xcite , here measured by comparing the 6-month the treasury bill and the federal funds rates .",
    "it is also conceivable that omori law decay of market aftershocks also exists in the traded volume time series and the bid - ask spread time series @xcite .",
    "recently , joulin _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite use a similar method to describe the relaxation of trading following news streaming from feeds such as dow jones and reuters , and compare to the relaxation following anomalous volatility jumps .",
    "_ @xcite also find omori law relaxation , with exponent @xmath149 following a news source , and @xmath150 following an endogenous jump ; interestingly , they find that the amplitude of the omori law is larger for news sources than for endogenous jumps . for further comparison , weber _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite find @xmath151 for the 38 days following the market crash on september 11 , 1986 .",
    "one distinct difference between these studies , is the source of the news : joulin _ et al . _",
    "pool together thousands of news sources , some possibly pertaining to only a single stock ; we focus on one particular type of news , the fomc target rate decision , which has a broad impact on the whole market and economy .",
    "it is possible that the difference between _ anticipated _ news and _ idiosyncratic _ news is the important criterion to consider when analyzing market response functions in relation to exogenous events . here , we find novel dynamics before anticipated announcements .    in the case of fomc news",
    ", speculation can be quantified by measuring the relative difference between the effective federal funds rate and the treasury bill in the weeks leading up to a scheduled meeting .",
    "we develop a speculation metric , @xmath142 , and relate it to @xmath152 , the volatility on the day of the meetings , finding that the market behaves more erratically when the treasury bill predicts a decrease in the federal funds target rate .",
    "a rate decrease often occurs in response to economic shocks , whereas a rate increase is often used to fight inflation .",
    "hence , the asymmetric response in fig .",
    "[ thetadaily ] to rising and falling rates is consistent with the  sign effect \" , where it has been found that bad news causes a larger market reaction than good news @xcite , and that the asymmetry may result from the increased uncertainty in expectations among traders .",
    "we analyze the four omori - law parameters @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 calculated for 19 fomc meetings .",
    "we conjecture that the omori - law parameters are related to the market s speculation , anticipation and surprise on the day of the fomc meeting . in order to quantify speculation of rate cuts and rate increases ,",
    "we define the measure @xmath142 , which is the relative spread between the treasury bill and the federal funds rates , before the meeting . in order to quantify surprise",
    ", we develop @xmath143 , which measures the change in the relative spread between the treasury bill and the federal funds rates , before and after the meeting .",
    "we relate both @xmath142 and @xmath143 to the dynamical response of the market on the day of the meeting .",
    "we find that relatively small @xmath3 values and relatively large amplitude @xmath77 values , corresponding to longer relaxation time and large response , follow from  bad \" news , as in the case of the market reaction to the world trade center attacks in 2001 .",
    "in all , these results show that markets relax according to the omori law following large crashes and federal interest rate changes , suggesting that the perturbative response of markets belongs to a universal class of omori laws , independent of the magnitude of news .",
