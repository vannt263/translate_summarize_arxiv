    "quantum devices using a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) formed in high - mobility gaas / al@xmath0ga@xmath1as semiconductor heterostructure have been found to have better performance characteristics than bulk devices .",
    "it has been predicated that the characteristics of the devices may be further improved by using quantum wires in which the carriers behave as a quasi - one - dimensional gas . and",
    "some technological success has been achieved in recent years in growing high - quality semiconductor quantum wires with a length up to @xmath2m.@xmath3 in the ballistic regime and at low temperatures quantum coherent effects will dominate the electron transport properties of a mesoscopic system .",
    "one of the most important features is that , when the lateral size of a quantum wire varies , the conductance shows an histogram structure and each step has an height of @xmath4 or integer times of it for both short wire@xmath5 ( quantum point contact ) and long wire.@xmath6    the electron transport properties of the quantum wire formed on a 2deg can be affected by many factors .",
    "the presence of disorders in a quantum wire generally leads to a suppression of the conductance plateaus below integer values.@xmath7 especially , for a quantum wire containing an attractive impurity the transmission shows resonance dips below each confinement subband.@xmath8 also , the interaction of electrons induces transport anomalies.@xmath9 however , there has been growing interest in the time - dependent transport for quantum wire systems in recent years , such as presence of a time - modulated potential@xmath10 and quantum pumping.@xmath11 further , when a quantum wire is illuminated under an external electromagnetic ( em ) field , due to the inelastic scattering of electrons by photons many new features have been observed experimentally@xmath12 and predicted theoretically.@xmath13 the technique of applying an external field is of particular interest , since no additional current and voltage probes have to be attached to the sample which may disturb the system s properties .",
    "more recently , a new type of giant magnetoresistance has been discovered@xmath14 and theoretically explained@xmath15 in a high - mobility 2deg subject to a high frequency microwave radiation and a vertical magnetic field .",
    "it is therefore of great interest in basic physics aspect to study the time - dependent transport properties of quantum structures on semiconductor 2deg system . on the other hand ,",
    "possible applications of nanostructures in future electronic devices , which will have to operate at very high frequencies , require detailed knowledge of their frequency- and time - dependent transport behavior .",
    "the values of the lateral energy level separation and the fermi energy are of the order of 1@xmath16100mev for the typical semiconductor quantum wires .",
    "this corresponds to frequencies of the range of 0.25@xmath1625 terahertz ( thz ) , which is available in experiments with the development of the ultrafast laser technology and the physics in this frequency range is of interest now.@xmath17 when the fermi level is below the lowest lateral level at the bottleneck part of a quantum wire , electrons can not go through without the assistance of an external em field .",
    "however , under the field illumination , electrons in the wire can absorb energy of photons and go through this geometric barrier ( the neck ) .",
    "therefore , in the region of barrier the electron transmission is determined by the combined effect of the external em field and the wire lateral shape variation.@xmath18 recently , with an emphasis on the pure em field effect on the electron transport , we have theoretically investigated@xmath19 a straight ( uniform cross - section ) and clean ( without impurity ) quantum wire illuminated under a transversely polarized thz em field .",
    "an interesting transmission step - like structure has been predicated when the em field frequency is resonant with the two lowest lateral energy levels of the quantum wire .",
    "also , the impurity effect on the transport is important for a thin and long quantum wire because the electron interaction effect is observable in the presence of backscattering.@xmath6 without considering this interaction , the resonance structures of the electron transmission in a straight quantum wire with a finite - size scatter for a wide range of the impurity parameters have been investigated in the absence of external em field.@xmath20 in the present paper , we combine the models in refs.[7,19 ] and study the electron transmission through a straight quantum wire containing a finite - size attractive impurity under a transversely polarized thz em field illumination . in this case the transmission behavior may reflect the interplay effects between the impurity@xmath20 and the external em field@xmath19 on the electron transport . within the effective mass free - electron approximation",
    ", the scattering matrix for the system has been formulated through a time - dependent mode matching method.@xmath19 using a group of numerical examples we demonstrate some interesting electron transmission behaviors for this system . to the best of our knowledge , the interplay effect between the impurity and the external em field on the electron transport for a quantum wire has not been reported previously .",
    "this effect may be important for the understanding of basic physics in low - dimensional systems and for the future nanoscale circuit applications .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we set up the problem for a straight quantum wire containing a finite - size impurity under an external thz em field illumination in terms of a single - electron time - dependent schrdinger equation , and calculate the electron transmission probability through the system by the time - dependent mode matching in the framework of landauer - bttiker formalism . some numerical examples to illustrate the dependence of the electron transmission on the incident energy , field parameters , and impurity parameters",
    "respectively are presented and discussed in sec .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "iv gives a conclusion of the paper .",
    "the system under study is an ideal straight 2d quantum wire ( quantum waveguide ) of width @xmath21 , containing a finite - size attractive impurity , which is depicted in fig .",
    "1 schematically.@xmath22 the quantum wire smoothly connects the two electron reservoirs ( leads ) at each end .",
    "the x - axis is longitudinally along the wire , and the y - axis describes the transverse direction .",
    "the impurity range @xmath23 in the quantum wire is illuminated under a transversely polarized thz em field in an unspecified way .",
    "the field vector potential can be described as @xmath24 with angular frequency @xmath25 and amplitude @xmath26 ( @xmath27 is the unit vector in the polarized direction ) .    within an effective mass approximation ,",
    "the single - particle time - dependent schrdinger equation in the field illuminated impurity region is @xmath28\\psi(x , y , t),\\ ] ] where we have adopted the unit of @xmath29 . in the hamiltonian , @xmath30 presents a transverse confining potential in the form of either a hard - wall or parabolic one which confines electrons to the wire and to the reservoirs , and @xmath31 is used to represent the single finite - size impurity potential , where @xmath32 is the strength of the impurity and @xmath33 is the step function ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "this type of the finite - size single impurity has been used to model an unintentional be doping in gaas semiconductor@xmath34 and may be artificially created in the quantum waveguide using recent nanotechnology.@xmath35    using the method used in ref.[19 ] ( also see ref.[20 ] ) to solve the time - dependent schringer equation ( 1 ) , and then considering the scattering of the two interfaces between the impurity region ( with field illumination ) and the clean region ( without field illumination ) separately.@xmath36 the detail knowledge about this aspects is referred to refs.[19,20 ] and is not presented here .",
    "when an electron with total incident energy @xmath37 emits from the left reservoir to the left interface at @xmath38 , transmission and reflection will take place simultaneously . because the electron has certain probability of absorbing a photon after penetrate the interface , transition from the lower mode to the upper mode happens .",
    "so there are two energy components of e and @xmath39 in the reflected wave in the region of @xmath40 @xmath41\\phi_1(y)+ c_2e^{-i[k_2x+(e+\\omega)t]}\\phi_2(y),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 ( n=1,2 ) are transverse eigenfunctions with eigenvalues @xmath43 in the clean region ( without impurity ) , @xmath44 , @xmath45 are the reflection coefficients of the two modes respectively , and @xmath46 are their associated wavevectors .",
    "consequently , we can obtain the electronic wavefunction in the region of @xmath47 @xmath48\\psi_1(y)+ [ g_+c_+e^{i[k_+x-(e+\\omega)t]}+g_-c_-e^{i[k_-x-(e+\\omega)t]}]\\psi_2(y),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the solutions for the transverse equation with impurity potential @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath52 , @xmath53 are the transmission coefficients of the two field - spilt modes and the constants @xmath54 ( where @xmath55 is the detuning , and @xmath56 is the two - mode coupling constant ) .",
    "the two electron wavevectors in the impurity region are @xmath57    we can match the above two wavefunctions ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) at the interface of @xmath38 . continuously connecting",
    "the two above wavefunctions and their differentials gives the following four algebraical equations for the coefficients @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the matrix elements for connecting the two sets of transverse eigenfunctions . with the solution of these algebraic equations in eq .",
    "( 7 ) both the transmission and the reflection matrix for the left interface ( as if without the right interface ) can be expressed by @xmath63,\\;\\;\\;\\ ; r=\\left[\\matrix{c_1 & 0 \\cr \\sqrt{k_2/k_1}\\;c_2 & 0}\\right].\\ ] ]    when we consider the electron transmission probability through the whole real impurity , we use the approach recently developed in ref . [ 21 ] for the symmetric system .",
    "this approach needs to derive the total scattering matrix which can be expressed in the transmission matrix and reflection matrix on each interface .",
    "the total transmission matrix is just the anti - diagonal submatrix of the total scattering matrix in the symmetry system case .    because of the similarity of the two interfaces one has not to match the wave functions at the right interface @xmath64 , but we need to know the transmission and reflection matrix of electron emitting from right to left for the left interface . in this case",
    "the electronic wavefunction in the impurity region is @xmath65e^{-iet}\\psi_{1}(y)\\nonumber\\\\ + [ g_+c_{+}^{e}e^{-ik_{+}x}+g_-c_{+}^{e}e^{-ik_{-}x } + g_+c_{+}^{r}e^{ik_{+}x}+g_-c_{-}^{r}e^{ik_{-}x}]e^{-i(e+\\omega ) t}\\psi_{2}(y),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 are the coefficients of the electron emitting from right to left , @xmath67 are the associated reflection coefficients . correspondingly , the transmitted electron wavefunction in the region of @xmath40 is @xmath68}\\phi_{2}(y),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the transmission coefficients .",
    "these two wavefunctions also satisfy the continuous condition at @xmath38 , from which we can obtain the transmission and reflection matrix from right to left for this interface , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively ( here we do not present the detailed expressions for them because they are much more complicated than eq .",
    "( 8) for @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) .",
    "consequently , the total transmission matrix through the two interfaces ( the whole system ) is @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , according to landauer - bttiker s formulation@xmath76 the total electron transmission probability through the whole system is @xmath77,\\ ] ] where @xmath78 is the transfer matrix between the two interfaces of the system.@xmath19",
    "in this section , we numerically calculate the transmission probability from eq .",
    "the physical quantities of the system are chosen to be a high mobility gaas / al@xmath0ga@xmath1as heterostructure@xmath79 with a typical electron density @xmath80@xmath81 and @xmath82 ( where @xmath83 is the free electron mass ) .",
    "we choose the hard - wall transverse confining potential and the width of the wire @xmath84   ( see fig .",
    "1 ) such that the unit of energy @xmath85mev which corresponds to the unit of time @xmath86s .",
    "correspondingly , the field frequency unit @xmath87thz and the amplitude unit @xmath88v / cm .",
    "this kind of radiation is available in experiments now.@xmath17 we also use the length unit @xmath89 .    for the hard - wall confining potential with a finite - size impurity of @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 ( see fig . 1 ) and strength @xmath93 , the transverse eigenvalues in the impurity region are solved by the quantum perturbation method as @xmath94 with associated eigenfunctions @xmath95 and @xmath96 . and",
    "different transverse eigenvalues as well as eigenfunctions can be obtained by variation of the impurity size .    in the following",
    "we systematically present some numerical examples , while restrict our attention to the energy range ( @xmath97 ) throughout the work .",
    "first of all , in the absence of the em field , the transmission probability @xmath98 as a function of incident energy @xmath37 should be the same as that in ref . [ 7 ] , which shows the berit - winger resonances in the lower energies @xmath99 and the multiple asymmetric fano lines in the upper energies @xmath100 .    in the presence of the em field",
    ", we show the calculated @xmath98 versus @xmath37 for two combinations of the field parameters in fig .",
    "2 with impurity size of @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and strength @xmath101 . the dashed line presents the case of resonant field frequency @xmath102 ) with @xmath103 , while the solid line gives a representative case of nonresonant frequency @xmath104 ) with @xmath105 . in the case of the field frequency resonant ( matching ) with the energy spacing of the two lowest levels ,",
    "the transmission probability is similar to that for the case of absent impurity@xmath19 except for a suppression of average 0.1 .",
    "also a step - raising of transmission occurs at energy @xmath106 ( for these field parameters the mode coupling constant @xmath107).@xmath108 this interesting phenomenon can be similarly explained by the field - induced intersubband transition.@xmath19 when an electron penetrate though the interface , the transverse levels of the electron in the field illuminated region are dressed and one electron mode is split into the two time - dependent modes with the longitudinal momentum @xmath109 and @xmath110 , respectively . when @xmath111 , @xmath109 is imaginary and its corresponding mode is an evanescent ( nonpropagating ) mode which contributes nothing to the transmission so that the total transmission probability is suppressed to an half value .",
    "further , when @xmath112 the both modes become propagating and all contribute to the transmission .",
    "however , with the non - resonant field frequency the structure of transmission probability is much different from the case without impurity . for this case of non - resonant frequency and weaker field amplitude",
    "we note that an interesting asymmetry fano - type resonance dip appear at @xmath113 , which indicates the formation of a quasibound states.@xmath20 electrons with this particular incident energy can make a transition from a propagating state to a quasibound state by emitting an energy of @xmath114 .",
    "so this resonance dip may be a result from the feature of the impurity - induced quasibound state .",
    "we can also explain this phenomenon with the mode propagational property .",
    "around the point of @xmath115 , from eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 6 ) we find that the wavevector @xmath116 and the field - split electron wavevector @xmath117 .",
    "this indicates that the two modes @xmath118 and @xmath109 may be nonpropagating . so that @xmath98 reaches a nonzero minimum because @xmath119 and @xmath110 are always propagating .",
    "we also note that there are some resonance oscillations on the two transmission curves in fig.2 .",
    "these oscillations physically result from the interference of the forward- and backward - going electron waves induced by the two interfaces of the impurity along the transport direction .",
    "the resonance peaks with prefect transmission on the solid line of fig . 2 appeared at lower energies @xmath1201.01 , 1.39 and 1.85 may be identified to the symmetry breit - type resonance and the half width of each resonance specifies the lifetime of the corresponding quasibound state .",
    "therefore , the above characteristics of @xmath98 dependence on @xmath37 for the system have implied the differences in electron transmission between the two cases of with and without@xmath20 em field and also between the two cases of with and without@xmath19 impurity .",
    "next , in this subsection we investigate the influence of the field parameters on the electron transmission with the interesting energy of @xmath121 for the nonresonat frequency case ( see fig .",
    "we present the numerically calculated t as a function of @xmath25 and @xmath26 as shown in fig .",
    "3 with the same impurity parameters as that in fig .",
    "2 . from fig .",
    "3 we can see that the transmission probability @xmath98 changes between @xmath122 ( black ) and @xmath123 ( white ) with the variation of the field parameters and shows several dip structures ( black areas ) around @xmath124 , which includes the dip of the solid line in fig . 2 at @xmath125 .",
    "we also note that there exist perfect transmission areas ( complete white ) . in the region of small",
    "@xmath26 ( regardless of the value of @xmath25 ) the field is too weak to affect the transmission , while in the region of @xmath126 ( resonant ) regardless of the value of @xmath26 the field - induced intersubbund transition dominates .",
    "however , with the proper combinations of @xmath26 and @xmath25 perfect transmission also occurs .",
    "this interesting phenomenon of perfect and blocked transmission has also been predicted@xmath127 for a narrow - wide - narrow shape clean quantum wire under a em field illumination for certain combinations of the field parameters .    in the following ,",
    "we discuss the effects of @xmath25 and @xmath26 on @xmath98 separately .",
    "fig.4 shows the calculated @xmath98 as function of @xmath25 for four different values of @xmath26 with the same impurity parameters as that in fig.2 . in the case of a rather weak field amplitude @xmath128 as shown in fig .",
    "4(a ) , multiple fano resonance lines appear within @xmath129 .",
    "this result is very similar to that in ref.[7 ] but within the range of higher energies .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 6 ) , we know that in this case mode @xmath109 begins to open ( propagating ) earlier than @xmath118 with @xmath130 and @xmath128 ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "there are two propagating modes ( @xmath109 and @xmath110 ) in the impurity region but only @xmath119 is propagational outside the impurity .",
    "the multiple fano resonances are connected with the interaction of multiple quasidonor levels but lowered by the em field . in fig .",
    "4(b ) with @xmath105 ( same value as that in solid line of fig .",
    "2 ) there is only one fano dip at @xmath132 , which corresponds to the single dip of the solid line in fig .",
    "2 . furthermore , as shown in fig .",
    "4(c ) with stronger amplitude @xmath133 , @xmath98 is suppressed with no dip in the range of @xmath134 because the open of @xmath118 enhances the probability of reflection .",
    "and @xmath98 increases when @xmath135 due to the second mode @xmath109 beginning to be propagating .",
    "so it is reasonable when only one mode ( @xmath110 ) in the illuminated region with @xmath136 is propagating and @xmath98 is more suppressed as shown in fig .",
    "4(d ) .    on the other hand , in fig .",
    "5 we present the calculated @xmath98 as function of @xmath26 for four different values of @xmath25 with the same impurity parameters . for a rather small @xmath137 in fig .",
    "5(a ) @xmath98 shows an oscillation behavior with almost periodic maximum ( perfect transmission ) and declined minimum ( valley ) as @xmath26 increases .",
    "the oscillation results from the interference of the forward- and backward - going electron waves induced by the two interfaces of the impurity along the transport direction . with a fixed @xmath132 ,",
    "the multiple fano resonance lines appear as shown in fig .",
    "5(b ) within @xmath138 .",
    "the pattern of @xmath98 is slightly different from that of fig .",
    "4(a ) but with the same physical reason .",
    "the perfect transmissions are seen to occur at @xmath26=0.78 , 1.4 , 1.68 and 2.3 and the asymmetric fano dips are seen to occur at @xmath26=0.8 , 1.38 , 1.82 @xmath139 .",
    "the second mode ( @xmath109 ) is the evanescent mode and the coupling of the two modes in field region vanishes as well as the formation of the quasibound states when @xmath140 holds . from the above analysis it seems reasonable that the step structure appears around @xmath141 in fig .",
    "5(c ) with @xmath142 .",
    "this results from the suppression of the second mode ( @xmath109 ) with increasing of @xmath26 when @xmath143 holds . in fig .",
    "5(d ) with @xmath144 the average @xmath98 is much enhanced with no dip or step structures because both @xmath109 and @xmath118 are propagating modes .    in general for a fixed electron incident energy , a different combination of the field parameters results in a different transmission dependence .",
    "but for the chosen geometrical parameters in this work the rich structure of the transmission always appear in the ranges of @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "finally , in this subsection we investigate the effects of the impurity parameters on the transmission probability @xmath98 for the same system .",
    "we first consider the effect of impurity size on the transmission .",
    "an example of different impurity width @xmath148 has been adopted and its corresponding transverse eigenvalues have been calculated as @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "6 shows the numerical results of @xmath98 as a function of @xmath37 with a fixed @xmath132 for two different @xmath26 . with @xmath105",
    "the multiple fano resonances appear in fig .",
    "6(a ) within a energy range of @xmath151 . however , fig .",
    "6(b ) shows that as @xmath26 increases to 3.6 with the same @xmath25 , a single fano dip line ( similar to the solid line in fig .",
    "2 ) appears .",
    "this indicates that the two modes ( @xmath118 and @xmath109 ) begin to be propagating . comparing with the solid line in fig .",
    "2 we conclude that as the width of the impurity increases , it need stronger field amplitude @xmath26 to suppress the splitting of the second mode . but this conclusion may not be extended to the increase of length @xmath152 .",
    "next , we consider the effect of the impurity strength on the transmission .",
    "an example of different impurity strength of @xmath153 has been adopted and its associated eigenvalues have been recalculated as @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "7 shows the numerical results of @xmath98 as a function of @xmath37 with a fixed @xmath132 for two different @xmath26 .",
    "a asymmetry fano dip also occurs in fig .",
    "7(a ) at @xmath156 ( with @xmath105 ) and in fig .",
    "7(b ) at @xmath113 ( with @xmath157 ) . from this result",
    "we conclude that with the same @xmath25 although the increase of the impurity strength one need stronger field amplitude @xmath26 to suppress the splitting of the second mode .",
    "it seems that the variation of the impurity strength does not change the transmission behavior much even if we use a @xmath158 potential to model the impurity . and",
    "this fact of model independence is physically reasonable .",
    "we have theoretically investigated the electron transport properties for a straight semiconductor quantum wire containing a single finite - size attractive impurity under a thz em field illumination in the ballistic limit . within the effective free - electron approximation ,",
    "a single - particle time - dependent schrdinger equation was established and the scattering matrix for the system was formulated via the method of time - dependent mode matching .",
    "the numerical examples predicate that a step - arising on the transmission probability versus the electron incident energy occurs in the case of the field frequency resonant with the lateral energy spacing of the two lowest levels .",
    "this situation is similar to the case of the system without@xmath19 impurity and the physical origin is mainly the coherent field - induced intersubband transition .",
    "however , due to the interplay between the impurity - induced quasibound states and the applied field , both multiple symmetry breit - type resonance peaks and asymmetry fan - type dip lines appear within the energy range of ( @xmath159,@xmath160 ) in the case of a weaker field amplitude and the non - resonant field frequency .",
    "this situation is also consistent with the system@xmath20 without field illumination .",
    "further , the dependence of the transmission on either field amplitude or frequency also indicates the change of the shape and the position of the resonance dips .",
    "but the rich structure of the transmission always appears with the proper combination of the field parameters .",
    "moreover , the transmission behavior is almost independent on the impurity parameters .",
    "therefore , from the results of this work we conclude that the field parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 can control the characteristics of electron transmission through the propagational property of the modes in a quantum wire .",
    "these effects of the applied field on the transport properties in a quantum wire may be useful for understanding basic physics of quantum structures and for device physics .",

    "<S> we theoretically investigate the electron transport properties for a semiconductor quantum wire containing a single finite - size attractive impurity under an external terahertz electromagnetic field illumination in the ballistic limit . within the effective mass free - electron approximation , </S>",
    "<S> the scattering matrix for the system has been formulated by means of a time - dependent mode matching method . </S>",
    "<S> some interesting properties of the electron transmission for the system have been shown through a few groups of numerical examples . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that in the case of the comparative stronger field amplitude and the frequency resonant with the two lowest lateral energy levels in the impurity region , the field - induced intersubband transition dominates the process as if without the impurity . </S>",
    "<S> and there is a step - arising on the transmission as a function of the incident electron energy . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the case of lower field amplitude and the non - resonant frequencies both multiple symmetry breit - type resonance peaks and asymmetry fano - type dip lines appear in the electron transmission dependence on the incident energy due to the presence of the impurity and the external field . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , within certain energy range the transmission as a function of the field frequency and/or field amplitude shows a rich structure . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the transmission dependence on the strength and size of the impurity is also discussed . </S>",
    "<S> it is suggested that these results mostly arise from the interplay effects between the impurity in a quantum wire and the applied field . </S>"
