    "little has been made for analogue signals in the information theory scope as compared to the amazing coverage nowadays available for digital signals @xcite .",
    "this paper is precisely focused on this rather unexplored field , taking advantage of a fresh and powerful tool : the wavelet analysis @xcite , @xcite - that evolved into a specialised branch of the modern - day signal processing .",
    "90 s witnessed the emergence of wavelets , which rapidly reached in practice , thanks to their natural feature of concentrating energy in a few transform coefficients .",
    "this paper intends to introduce a new insight into wavelets , which is based on the conventional de broglie duality principle and the statistical interpretation of the wave - function formulated by max born @xcite .",
    "two concepts of information ( logon and shannon information ) are considered @xcite , @xcite , as well as their relation with entropy .",
    "entropy ( greek : @xmath1=in+turning ) is one of the most fundamental concepts of science .",
    "since the notion of entropy appeared , it has always been surrounded by a halo of inscrutability .",
    "the well - known german chemist w. ostwald put it in this way : `` energy is the queen of the world , and entropy is her shadow ! ''",
    "it was also told that when von neumman suggested that shannon use the word entropy , he added , `` it will give you a great edge in debates because nobody really knows what entropy is anyway ''  @xcite . quite often people hear about entropy the first time when the most tantalising problems such as the origin of the life or the future of the universe is discussed .",
    "schrdinger has mentioned @xcite that living organisms feed on negative entropy , i.e. , they drive in the direction of increasing organisation .",
    "the proposal of this paper is mainly to build a bridge between two areas of applied mathematics : the analysis - decomposition ( with wavelets ) and the information theory , from a perspective not much explored so as to awaken interest in new advances .",
    "it should be clarified that techniques and results derived in this article are naive .",
    "+   + to begin with , a first question is raised : `` is it possible to associate an entropy measure with a wavelet '' ?",
    "jumarie @xcite introduced entropy associated with a given continuous differentiable function @xmath2 as ( @xmath3 denotes the real set )    @xmath4    as a first attempt , the entropy of a continuous differentiable wavelet @xmath5 can be defined by @xmath6    the seminal max born footnote for interpreting the solution of schrdinger equation in quantum mechanics is applied here in the wavelet framework . as a consequence ,",
    "it is suggested that wavelets can behave as some kind of little particle ( corpuscle of a true random nature ) .",
    "bearing in mind that the square of the wave - function is a probability density , we propose in a parallel way to associate a probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath7 with every basic continuous wavelet @xmath8 .",
    "given that fourier transform is an isometric transform , we can go further anchored in the parseval identity and propose to associate @xmath9 with an additional density function expressed by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the fourier transform of @xmath8 .",
    "the fundamental challenge is to determine the behaviour of a corpuscle when its freedom of motion is limited by the action of external forces : each wavelet describes a specific situation .",
    "it can be therefore stated that : `` wavelets are to corpuscle as wave - functions are to particles . '' after unveiling such probabilistic properties associated with wavelets , it is intuitive to set up another concept : the shannon entropy associated with a wavelet as a measure of the disorder of a signal .",
    "the entropy of a random variable can be defined in the discrete case as well as in the continuous case @xcite , @xcite . in the later case ,",
    "the so - called shannon differential entropy of a random variable @xmath12 with probability density @xmath13 is defined by @xmath14    the information unit depends on the base of the logarithm . for the sake of convenience , shannon ( binary unit )",
    "is adopted through this paper for the information unity .",
    "according to the above vindication , the entropy of a wavelet can be measured by :    ( shannon entropy of a wavelet ) .",
    "the time entropy , @xmath15 , of a continuous wavelet @xmath16 is defined by @xmath17    in an parallel way , the frequency entropy , @xmath18 , of a continuous wavelet @xmath16 is defined by    @xmath19    the entropy gives information on the spreading of the wavelet , i.e. , it furnishes a `` localising measure '' of the corpuscle in a particular domain ( time or frequency ) .",
    "the probability distribution function associated with the density @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 .",
    "the time shannon entropy of a wavelet is , therefore , exactly the jumarie entropy of the pdf related to the density @xmath22 , i.e. , @xmath23 . for completeness ,",
    "other `` non - shannonian ''  measures such as the renyi entropy of order @xmath24 could promptly be defined for wavelets @xcite :    @xmath25    which hold @xmath26    indeed , while gabor functions can be used to derive similar results , it is worth noting that standard are also wavelets .",
    "the harmonic oscillator equation solutions @xcite have these properties .",
    "in fact , hermite polynomials of degree @xmath27 , modulating a gaussian pulse , yield either a wavelet or a scale function ( respectively , @xmath28 odd , @xmath28 even ) . now , even further class of functions such as wave functions of the schrdinger equation could also be considered , it must be remembered that they can also be interpreted as wavelets .",
    "+ conducting a careful literature search , attempts to connect wavelets and entropy were found . in 1999 ,",
    "quian quiroga , rosso and basar have successfully applied a disorder measure in neuroscience @xcite . here",
    ", the total energy @xmath29 of the signal in each time window is calculated as the sum of energies of all resolution levels .",
    "the relative wavelet energy @xmath30 is computed as the ratio between the energy of each level , @xmath31 , and total energy of the signal , @xmath32 in the respective time window .",
    "the wavelet entropy , @xmath33 , was then defined by    @xmath34    the main focus of this tool had specifically been on the electroencephalogram analysis @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "thereafter , this concept was applied to astronomy with the aim of investigating the solar activity @xcite .",
    "despite the fact that @xmath33 had been referred to as the wavelet entropy up to now , it should not be named so . actually , @xmath33 depends on the analysed signal and it is not a solely feature of the @xmath9 @xmath35 @xmath36 .",
    "the term `` wavelet entropy '' is thereby somewhat inappropriate , and it should be better called as `` the entropy of a wavelet decomposition of a signal . ''",
    "the effect of scaling or shifting a mother wavelet on the time and frequency entropy is initially examined .    : given a continuous mother wavelet @xmath16 with time entropy @xmath15 and frequency entropy @xmath18 , the entropy of a daughter wavelet @xmath37 , @xmath38 can be computed by @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .    .",
    "the first part follows from substituting @xmath41 in definition 1 , and evoking that both @xmath16 and @xmath42 have normalised energy .",
    "the second part is derived using @xmath43 .",
    "the highest time entropy among all supportly compacted wavelets is achieved by the haar wavelet .",
    "this is in agreement with the fact that maximum entropy of a discrete random variable is achieved by a uniform distribution as it can be seen by the following proposition :    : the time entropy of any wavelet of compact support is bounded by @xmath44 , and the bound is only met by the haar wavelet .    .",
    "let @xmath45 denote the length of the support of the wavelet and @xmath46",
    ". clearly @xmath47",
    "then @xmath48    the upper bound is only achieved by a haar scaled version @xmath49 , where @xmath50 .",
    "+    : the time shannon entropy of dbn wavelet is bounded by @xmath51 .",
    "this result can equally be translated into the frequency domain , deriving , for instance ,    : the frequency shannon entropy of the deo wavelet @xcite is upper bounded by @xmath52 .",
    "a pertinent comment should now be pointed out . according to the deterministic approach , in the cases where the wavelet waveform is fully known , so is its spectrum .",
    "one could argue that there is no information in the frequency domain .",
    "now , this reasoning is fallacious .",
    "if the wavelet spectrum is perfectly determined , no information is provided in the time domain ! instead of this , it seems to be some amount of information in both domains matching with the gabor uncertainty principle . in the probabilistic interpretation offered in this paper , even knowing @xmath16 and @xmath53 , it do exists some nonzero uncertainty in both time and frequency domain",
    ". the global entropy would be partially due to the ( inherent ) time - uncertainty and partially due to the ( inherent ) frequency - uncertainty .",
    "the entropy is only added when dealing with independent variables .",
    "we assume that the mutual information between time and frequency domain is zero , i.e. , @xmath54 .",
    "an interesting argument consists of defining the global entropy of a wavelet as the sum of the entropy in both domains .",
    "+   + formally ,    ( global entropy of a continuous wavelet ) .",
    "the global entropy of a wavelet @xmath16 is defined by @xmath55    a direct property follows from such a definition : every daughter wavelet has the same global entropy of the mother wavelet , some sort of conservation principle .",
    "it follows then    : the global entropy is preserved within the same wavelet family @xmath56 so we are able to find a unique entropy value associate to a wavelet basis",
    ".    thermodynamic concepts of entropy are always related to the temperature .",
    "particularly , common units for entropy are joule.k@xmath57 and cal.k@xmath57 .",
    "having defined the entropy of wavelets , another concept of interest could be the `` temperature of a wavelet '' .",
    "this modus operandi suggests computing the temperature as the ratio between energy and entropy of the wavelet , i.e. , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the energy of the wavelet .",
    "for instance , the temperature of the complex morlet wavelet is @xmath60 , that is hotter than the mexican hat wavelet ( @xmath61 ) , and haar wavelet is even colder , @xmath62 .",
    ".analytical expressions of some continuous wavelets : morlet , mexican hat , gauss1 , shannon , haar , and de oliveira wavelets . [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     let @xmath63 be the shannon binary entropy @xcite .",
    "the shannon entropy of the db1 wavelet ( haar ) , which is described by @xmath64 $ ] , is @xmath65 as expected . for db2 ,",
    "whose filter coefficients are given by    @xmath66\\ ] ]    the entropy is @xmath67 .",
    "values of the shannon entropy for a few orthogonal wavelets defined by mra filters are presented in the table iii .",
    "the bound derived for supportly compact wavelets ( proposition 2 ) can be checked without effort .",
    "we hypothesize from eqn(18 ) and table iii that @xmath68 is probably the same as @xmath15 .",
    "wavelet is a body of knowledge of enormous fascination and far - reaching utility in signal processing , which is advancing at an astonishing pace . mimicking the quantum mechanics approach , each of ( continuous ) wavelets",
    "is associated with two probability density functions one on the time domain , and another on the frequency domain .",
    "consequently , the shannon entropy and renyi entropy of a wavelet were defined .",
    "we derived some sort of entropy conservation principle , which stated that wavelet versions resulting from the same mother wavelet retain the same shannon entropy .",
    "the logical consistency of the m@xmath69lange of claims throughout this paper provides certain evidence on the worthiness of our approach . the emphasis of this paper was on conveying the chief ideas as opposed to presenting a formal mathematical development or applications .",
    "indeed , much was left to be investigated . despite the fact that a mere trough draft of this technique had been outlined , it instigates certain expectation on both theoretical and practical information theory outcome related to wavelet analysis ( e.g.",
    "wavelet compression can be carried out on wavelet - based information - theory - oriented algorithms not on the energy . )",
    "we foresee that our attempt to present the underlying philosophy of behind the wavelet information theory may help users navigate the ocean of wavelets .",

    "renato jos de sobral cintra ( de - ufpe ) for quite a lot of comments .",
    "worth also a thank an anonymous reviewer for perusal and comments ."
