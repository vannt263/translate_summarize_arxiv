    "only the flattest stages yield intensity maxima at @xmath32   , partly for its close in - phase scattering condition , mostly because of the larger spread in the he wavector at this energy , which smears the interference among the he waves scattered by different terraces . in this case",

    "interestingly , also the other curves display a bi - layer modulation of the layer - by - layer oscillations , which evolves towards bi - layer oscillations beyond 10 - 12  ml .",

    "this bi - layer periodicity is due to the friedel s oscillation of the pb electron density in a semi - infinite slab .",

    "it must be pointed out that , in order to observe the interference effect between the growing layers , pb growth must proceed coherently over a large surface area , since has scattering is averaged over an effective illuminated area of about 0.5  mm@xmath35 . in the early stage of deposition",
    ", growth seems to proceed via random nucleation of 3d pb clusters and the has diffraction peaks of the pb(111 ) surface are first observed at about 4  ml .",
    "the pb(111 ) surface is incommensurate with the substrate and its main symmetry axis @xmath29 is found to be oriented at @xmath36 with respect to the [ 001 ] substrate direction .",
    "in fact , two pb(111 ) domains rotated by @xmath37 are found , which is the only fingerprint left from the substrate squared lattice .",
    "has diffraction from a pb(111 ) surface first appears at @xmath38  ml . at this coverage",
    ", the pb film is not yet wetting the whole substrate , in fact the diffraction peaks originated by the substrate pseudomorphic structure are still detected ( see left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "this could be due either to fragmentation of the film into flat islands , as commonly observed for pb on si(111 ) @xcite , or to the occurrence of deep pits uncovering the substrate , as observed for ag on si(111 ) and gaas(110 ) @xcite .",
    "however , just after the deposition of one additional layer , the substrate peaks disappear and the pb(1,0 ) peaks reach their nominal position @xcite without any further shift as the thickness increases , i.e. no lateral strain is observed beyond 5  ml . at this coverage",
    ", we can not exclude the occurrence of small pits , which would be hidden due to shadowing effects . at 5  ml of pb , the pits uncovering the pseudomorphic pb layer would be 4-layer deep and their maximum lateral size for not being detected would be 3  nm , to be compared with an average domain size of 13  nm ( calculated from the pb(111 ) peak width ) or an average terrace size of 25  nm ( calculated from the specular peak width ) .",
    "x - ray reflectivity measurements , shown in the bottom of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , also support the model in which a flat surface is formed at the completion of the 5th pb monolayer .",
    "the x - ray reflectivity oscillations have a thickness periodicity corresponding to the selected momentum transfer , but , in case of a perfect layer - by - layer growth , cusp - like features are superimposed to the oscillations , due to an overall increase of the reflectivity whenever a flat surface is formed @xcite .",
    "we have fitted the x - ray reflectivity to a simple growth model with the scattered intensity calculated as : @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the ge substrate structure factor @xcite and pb atomic scattering factor @xcite , respectively , @xmath42 is the atom density of a pb(111 ) layer , @xmath43 is the perpendicular coordinate of the @xmath7-layer and @xmath44 is the instantaneous coverage of the @xmath7-layer .",
    "the layer filling as been described according to a conventional birth - death model @xcite : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the deposition rate ( in atom per second and unit area ) and the interlayer diffusion probability @xmath47 is a phenomenological effective parameter describing both the intra- and inter - layer atom diffusion @xcite .",
    "all the interlayer pb(111 ) spacings have been kept fixed to the bulk value , while the separation @xmath48 between the first ( bottom ) pb layer and the substrate has been fitted to obtain the interface thickness .",
    "this parameter strongly affects the average reflectivity intensity , which is asymptotically matched at high coverage .        as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , a contracted interface thickness has been found corresponding to @xmath49 . from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , it can be seen that the first cusp - like feature , corresponding to a flat surface , is found after the deposition of 5  ml , a similar feature is observed at any photon energy ( compare with x - ray reflectivities shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . at lower coverage , the experimental data show similar oscillations for all the considered perpendicular momentum transfer , which can not be reproduced by any layer - by - layer growth simulation . from comparison with",
    "has reflectivity , we can say that in this coverage range the pb film is growing with 3d islands , which are also undergoing a morphological transformation towards an homogeneous flat film of 5  ml .      the pb film , grown layer by layer below 130  k , is always found to be kinetically frozen for thickness up to a few dozen monolayers .",
    "whenever the lt pb film is annealed to the room temperature , the pb(111 ) diffractions peaks disappear and only the diffraction from the pseudomorphic phase is detected ( both with has and x - ray scattering ) , thus suggesting a fragmentation of the film into large clusters uncovering the pb / ge interface .",
    "right panel : by annealing below the deconstruction temperature ( dotted curve , arrow pointing right ) the pb(111 ) surface quality ( domain size ) is increased as witnessed by the strong intensity increase obtained upon cooling down ( dotted curve , arrow pointing left ) .",
    "the debye - waller exponential attenuation ( full line ) on the given pb film can be obtained from the cooling branch of the temperature ramp . the full heating ramp displayed in the left panel at 5  ml",
    "is also shown for comparison after the debye - waller attenuation correction.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    in fact , the lt smooth and wetting film appears to be metastable , as substrate temperatures lower than 130  k are required for the onset of regular layer - by - layer growth , but the surface quality ( terrace and domain size as obtained by the diffracted peak widths ) can be increased by short annealing up to 190  k of the pb film after deposition .",
    "the intensity of the pb(1,0 ) diffracted peak , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , has been taken for a few film thickness during annealing at a constant rate .",
    "the pb(1,0 ) irreversibly disappears beyond a deconstruction temperature ranging from 190 to 220  k , depending on the film thickness .",
    "if the film is annealed below the critical temperature and then cooled down , the pb(111 ) domain size can be almost doubled .",
    "further deposition on the annealed film yields reflectivity oscillations with larger amplitude ( for both has and x - ray reflectivity ) , i.e. more perfect layer - by - layer growth conditions are met .",
    "similarly , pre - deposition at rt of 1  ml , leading to the formation of a pseudomorphic @xmath23 phase with larger domains , yields better layer - by - layer growth upon further deposition at lt .     and along the same azimuthal orientation [ 001]+45@xmath9 .",
    "]    the fragmentation of the wetting pb film can be demonstrated by the measurement shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , where 13  ml of pb are deposited at lt .",
    "first the film is well ordered by a short flash to 200  k , then the decomposition is activated by a flash to 250  k and quickly frozen by a rapid quench to 130  k. further lt deposition yields the same layer - by - layer growth oscillations , as for original deposition on the clean substrate .",
    "we must conclude that pb growth on existing large 3d islands yields an uncorrelated contribute to the he scattering , while the oscillations are due to coherent growth on the uncovered pb / ge interface .",
    "the reduced amplitude of the reflectivity oscillations reflects the smaller uncovered area of the substrate , where coherent layer - by - layer growth can take place .    a similar behavior is observed when depositing pb at rt , where no ordered structure formation is observed after the formation of the pseudomorphic phase at 1  ml , and then cooling down below 130  k to continue the deposition ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) : layer - by - layer growth is observed again , as for a clean substrate . the only difference with the reflectivity measurements of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is the time required for the onset of layer - by - layer growth , which is delayed on the pre - deposited substrate .",
    "the pb islands thus act as a sink for the diffusing adatoms , delaying the formation of the flat film .    .",
    "each curve is labelled by the corresponding ge(001 ) terrace size ( in nm ) .",
    "the top curve ( thick line ) has been obtained by deposition of the 1st pb ml at rt and further deposition at lt . ]",
    "the sharpness of the interface seems to play a fundamental role in the onset of layer - by - layer growth .",
    "pb deposition at 130  k has been performed on ge(001 ) of different average terrace size , as obtained by controlled ion erosion @xcite . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , the larger the terrace size is , the larger are the amplitudes of the reflectivity oscillations .",
    "as the average terrace size is decreased one observes an increasing delay in the onset of layer - by - layer oscillations and an anticipation of the bi - layer modulation .",
    "for the narrower terrace width , only faint double layer modulations are observed , which are superimposed on a rather intense he reflectivity background indicating the formation of a metallic surface .",
    "concerning the irregular , but reproducible , shape of the has layer - by - layer oscillations , a detailed study of the reflectivity as a function of @xmath17 found it to be originated by an oscillatory variation of the apparent monatomic step height as new layers are added ( see right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , i.e. to an oscillatory change of the interference conditions from the pb(111 ) terraces @xcite .",
    "these oscillations have been attributed to qse , i.e. to perpendicular displacements of the surface charge density occurring whenever new qws can be accomodated below the fermi level as the film thickness @xmath50 is increased .",
    "this mechanism has been experimentally confirmed by stm spectroscopy on individual flat pb islands grown on si(111 ) , where the quantum numbers have been assigned to each quantized state for islands of different thickness @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that adding a new layer increases the number of bound states below the fermi level by either one or two for islands of consecutive layer thickness ( recall that three new bound states can be accommodated for each bi - layer thickness increase , since @xmath51 ) , which corresponds to a cyclic variation of the energy separation between the fermi level and the highest occupied state ( see left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) . as a consequence the slope of the in - vacuum tail decay of the total surface charge density @xmath52 is also changing , and the corresponding turning point for he atoms scattered by the surface",
    "is perpendicularly displaced in an oscillatory fashion ( see right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) .",
    "in fact , in a critical revision of the has study published in ref .",
    "@xcite , toennies et al . argued that the apparent oscillations of the step height are to be entirely attributed to the cyclic displacement of the he turning point due to the electronic qse @xcite , while ab initio calculations predict the ionic cores to follow the displacement of the charge density , even if to a lower extent @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the phenomenological model used in ref .",
    "@xcite to estimate the in - vacuum charge spillout was supported by ab initio calculation for a pb(111 ) slab of up to 15 layers @xcite .",
    "slight oscillations of the surface relaxation ( @xmath53% ) and of the topmost interlayer spacings were predicted as a function of the slab thickness , which did not alter the average -5% compression of the topmost to second layer spacing and the average + 2% expansion of the 2nd to 3rd layer spacing .",
    "these calculated average values are in good agreement with the experimental ones obtained on a pb(111 ) bulk sample @xcite .    in order to discriminate between the different relaxation models , we used surface x - ray diffraction to measure the perpendicular distribution of the pb(111 ) layers within the growing film .",
    "for a few selected thicknesses we collected the x - ray data as a function of the perpendicular momentum transfer along the pb(111 ) crystal truncation rod , i.e. the diffracted intensity distributed in the reciprocal space among the bragg reflections .",
    "the pb(111 ) layer spacings can be determined by fitting the x - ray interference fringes detected along the rod scan .",
    "in particular , we measured the ( 2,@xmath54,0)+l(1,1,1 ) rod from the in - plane ( 2,@xmath54,0 ) peak ( l=0 ) up to l@xmath01.4 , through the out of plane ( 3,@xmath55,1 ) peak ( l=1 ) .",
    "each point along the rod scan has been individually fitted in order to obtain the appropriate background subtraction and integrated intensity , as reported in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "is schematically represented for the two cases of the left panel .",
    "thick and thin lines are assigned to the 3- and 4-layer thickness pb films , respectively .",
    "the two iso - density perpendicular coordinates for the he turning point ( and for the stm tip distance from the surface ) are also shown . ]",
    "first of all , it must be pointed out that the pb(111 ) in - plane diffraction peak first appears at a pb coverage of @xmath0  2.5  ml , in contrast to the amorphous growth reported for pb on si(111 ) , where the xrd peaks of crystalline pb(111 ) are first observed after 5 pb monolayers @xcite . at the coverage of 2.5  ml ,",
    "the diffracted intensity is not high enough for measuring the entire rod scan , however at least three pb(111 ) layers can be observed approaching the coverage of 3  ml .",
    "keeping in mind that a large uncovered area of pseudomorphic layer is clearly detected by has at this coverage , we can conclude that the x - ray diffraction yield is given by largely spaced 3d islands .",
    "we did not directly measure the structure evolution of the pseudomorphic layer below the growing pb(111 ) islands .",
    "in fact , the stability of a pseudomorphic phase was observed by x - ray diffraction for pb on si(111 ) , where the diffraction peaks from the pb - induced @xmath56 reconstruction were still detected after the deposition of 1800     of pb @xcite .",
    "however , the same authors found that the @xmath57 pb - induced reconstruction is destroyed by the growing islands @xcite .",
    "the different number of metal atoms per unit cell , which are covalently bound to the substrate , probably determines the stability criteria of the pseudomorphic layer . in our case , when entering in the layer - by - layer growth regime , the number of pb(111 ) layers is found to be equal to the number of deposited monolayers , thus suggesting the deconstruction of the pseudomorphic layer to be incorporated in the pb(111 ) film ( recall that the pseudomorphic layer as practically the same atom density of a pb(111 ) layer @xcite ) . both the appearance of the first pb islands with a three - layer thickness and the onset of layer - by - layer growth at a thickness of five pb(111 ) layers qualitatively agree with the magic and critical thickness predicted by the zhang s model for pb growth on semiconductors @xcite .",
    "however , the enhanced surface flatness observed by has at even - layer multiples ( see the low kinetic roughness at 4 , 6 , 8 , 10  ml in the middle panel of fig .  [ fig2 ] ) asks for more refined calculations to understand the role played by the pseudomorphic interface .    in a kinematical scattering scheme ,",
    "the integrated intensities of diffraction peaks are proportional to the modulus square of the crystal structure factors , whose magnitude can be simulated in order to retrieve the atomic plane positions .",
    "the rod scan simulations were computed using both home - made routines @xcite and the freely distributed rod program @xcite , which yielded equivalent results . since the pb(111 )",
    "layers are incommensurate with the substrate and no accidental superposition with the ge rods occurs , the calculation can be performed for a free standing pb film .",
    "the interlayer spacings , the debye - waller attenuation factors and the layer fillings have been used as fitting parameters .",
    "for the 6 and 6.5  ml pb coverage films , we have reduced the total number of fitting parameters ( up to 18 could be considered ) by considering a complete layer filling except for the topmost layer , as suggested by the has and x - ray reflectivity measurements .",
    "a good reproduction of the measured curves was possible only by assuming a strong layer - dependence of the debye - waller ( dw ) factors .",
    "the dw factor for a bulk pb crystal is available from the literature as derived from experimentally determined phonon density of states @xcite . for a crystal temperature of 130  k , the thermally averaged rms displacement of a bulk atom from its equilibrium position",
    "is expected to be @xmath58   . in general",
    "we found larger dw factors , corresponding to displacements spanning from @xmath0  0.15   , for the deeper layer , up to @xmath0  0.45     for the topmost one . while a larger average displacement may be expected for a surface atom than for a bulk one , other mechanisms could be involved . in fact , large terraces are formed during lt layer - by - layer growth , which do not evolve after interruption of the evaporation .",
    "this implies a very high mobility of the pb surface atoms , which contributes to the increase of the rms displacement .",

    "the hierarchy of the layer depth is given both by the finite value of the x - ray penetration length for pb ( 20   ) , yielding different weights for different layers , and by the hierarchy of the dw factors ( the smaller the deeper ) .",
    "as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] , the distance between the first ( bottom ) and second layer is always contracted up to @xmath59  % of the bulk pb(111 ) interlayer spacing .",
    "given the free standing slab model used for the simulation , no information can be obtained about the height of the bottom layer of pb(111 ) above the interface ( whose thickness was also found by x - ray reflectivity to be contracted ) .",
    "more interestingly , it is clearly seen that the topmost layer height oscillates around the bulk value as new layers are added .",
    "in contrast to the calculations by materzanini et al .",
    "@xcite , the atomic plane of the topmost layer is effectively following the surface charge density in its oscillatory behavior , yielding alternative expansion / compression of a few percent , as predicted by early calculations @xcite .",
    "as expected @xcite , also the inner layer spacings display small relaxations ( within 1 - 2  % ) .",
    "however , given the error bars and the increasing number of fitting parameters as the thickness increases , it is not possible to single out a general behavior for the inner layers .",
    "only the subsurface layer seems to display an oscillating behavior ( opposed to the oscillation of the topmost layer relaxation )    , as obtained by fitting to the rod scans of fig .",

    "the height of the @xmath7-layer above the @xmath60-layer is given .",
    "the 1st layer distance from the interface can not be determined since the simulation has been performed for a free - standing pb(111 ) film . ]",
    "the absolute amount of the topmost layer relaxation is much lower than the amplitude of the apparent step height oscillation , as measured by has .",
    "in fact , a direct comparison between these two quantities is misleading , since the xrd analysis yields the height of a layer on top of another one , while has measures the apparent step height separating two adjacent terraces , i.e. two topmost layers of different height level .",
    "a more suitable term of comparison is the height difference between the xrd topmost layer of two consecutive thickness pb films .",
    "the xrd step height is thus evaluated as @xmath61 and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] in comparison with the has apparent step height . in this case",
    "the variation of the step height becomes relevant ( exceeding @xmath62  % of the bulk pb(111 ) layer spacing ) , even if it is still lower than the corresponding value obtained by has .",
    "most importantly the step height oscillations effectively follow the surface charge density oscillations measured by has .",
    "the surface relaxation is thus strongly affected by qse .",
    "a similar conclusion was indirectly obtained by the detailed stm spectroscopy study of tsong and coworkers @xcite , who measured the oscillations of the apparent step height as a function of the tip bias voltage and found them to be present also for a reversed bias , thus indicating an effective structural variation of the step height .    .",
    "the variation of the surface relaxation due to qse , although small , is sizeable and led us to study its influence on the pb film vibrational properties by inelastic he scattering .",
    "if the variations of the topmost interlayer distance observed for different film thicknesses were large enough , they may be expected to alter also the force constants of the growing film and therefore modify the acoustic vibrations of the film .",
    "the phonon dispersion curves of the pb(111 ) vibrational modes have been measured along the @xmath29 and @xmath63 ( at 30@xmath9 from @xmath29 ) high symmetry directions within the 1st brillouin zone ( bz ) of the pb(111 ) surface and compared for different pb film thicknesses where the largest qses have been observed .",
    "the time of flight ( tof ) spectra of low energy he atoms ( @xmath64 mev ) have been acquired for different scattering geometries .",
    "all measurements have been performed at 130  k , where pb thin films are stable enough to allow long time phonon data acquisitions . from the position of the inelastic peaks in the tof spectra , the scattering events in which he atoms have exchanged energy and momentum quanta at the surface",
    "may be identified , i.e. scattering events in which surface phonons are created / annihilated . the resulting phonon dispersion obtained from over 20 tof spectra taken at different incidence angles",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] .",
    "since there are two 90@xmath9-rotated domains of pb(111 ) , both @xmath29 and @xmath63 phonon dispersion curves are detected along the same surface direction .",
    "two distinct acoustic branches have been identified , one with a flat dispersionless behavior at @xmath65  @xmath18 , corresponding to the brillouin zone boundary along the @xmath29 surface direction and another one at higher frequencies , dispersing up to 1.19  @xmath18 ( @xmath66 point along the @xmath67 direction ) .",
    "both branches have been identified a posteriori as acoustic branches along the @xmath29 and @xmath67 directions , respectively .",
    "this discrimination was not possible for high energy points appearing as an optical phonon branch close to the @xmath68 point , thus they are reported along both @xmath29 and @xmath63 directions .        for comparison , fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] also shows the calculated vibrational spectra of an infinite pb crystal projected on the ( 111 ) direction with pb force constants obtained from ref .",
    "the shadowed area is obtained as the density of the bulk projected vibrational modes weighted with the component of the mode polarization along the surface normal in order to mimic the he inelastic cross section @xcite .",
    "the experimental points along both @xmath29 and @xmath63 directions fall below the bulk projected area , confirming the surface character of the detected vibrational modes .",
    "an appreciable difference among the phonon energies of different films has been detected over a wide range of momentum exchange ( see the inset panel in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] ) .",
    "for instance , along the @xmath63 surface direction , the observed phonon frequencies of the 6  ml pb film are found to be higher than those of the 7  ml pb film ( @xmath69  5  % ) .",
    "however , a clear thickness dependent variation of the phonon frequencies could not be assigned .",
    "in fact , the effect of force constants variation due to topmost layer stretching / contraction is smeared or even cancelled out by the inner layer contraction / stretching .",
    "pb deposition on ge(001 ) has been shown to proceed layer - by - layer when the substrate is held at temperatures lower than @xmath0  130  k. similar findings have been found by a few authors for pb deposited on si(111 ) at even lower temperatures @xcite .",
    "such 2d heteroepitaxial growth may be expected from energy balance models when the pb films exceed a critical thickness of five layers @xcite .",
    "in fact , the occurrence of an initial transient regime , where pb deposition proceeds by island growth , is commonly observed .",
    "the observed critical thickness seems to depend not only on the chemical nature of the substrate @xcite , but also on its temperature and terrace size .",
    "x - ray reflectivity appears to be the most reliable technique to measure the critical thickness , since it effectively probes the whole film .",
    "both our xrr measurements and those for pb / si(111 ) @xcite indicate the formation of a flat pb surface after the deposition of 5  ml . at this thickness ,",
    "a 2d growth is observed by both rheed @xcite and has @xcite surface , yielding characteristic layer - by - layer oscillations .",
    "however , the transition from the island growth to the smooth growth might not be abrupt .",
    "in fact , our has data indicate that already at 4  ml a flat morphology is formed ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , but a complete wetting of the substrate is not met up to 5 - 6  ml . the complete wetting of the substrate could be driven by the mechanism envisaged for ag deposited on si(111 ) @xcite and gaas(110 ) @xcite , where a film with a flat surface of six layers is already formed at a coverage lower than 6  ml with several empty pits having steep perpendicular walls reaching the interface .",
    "further ag deposition leads to the formation of the next layers and pits filling .",
    "for pb on ge(001 ) , the lt growth could be described as follows .",
    "the first monolayer forms a pseudomorphic layer having almost the same atomic density of the close packed ( 111 ) plane @xcite , then pb clusters are formed , which soon display a pb(111 ) crystal structure ( in contrast to pb on si(111 ) , where the crystal structure is formed at 5  ml ) .",
    "flat pb islands , probably interconnected , of homogeneous height level are formed at 4  ml , as witnessed by the appearance of the first maximum in has reflectivity .",
    "a complete substrate wetting is achieved at 6  m , and the corresponding film displays an extremely flat surface .",
    "layer - by - layer growth is then observed up to a dozen of monolayers , with highly flat morphologies occurring at even - layer pb coverage . at larger thickness ,",
    "bi - layer modulations dominate the has reflectivity .",
    "the analysis of the xrd rod scans suggests that the pb pseudomorphic layer is decomposed to contribute to the pb(111 ) film .",
    "in fact , the number of pb(111 ) layers within the film corresponds to the number of deposited pb monolayers . on the contrary , the pseudomorphic layer produced by lt deposition on si(111 )",
    "has been found by xrd to be preserved also below a thick pb film @xcite .    if the temperature is not low enough , or the substrate terrace size is not large enough , island growth sets in and the height correlation between different islands is lost , thus smearing the layer - by - layer features . for comparison , we recall that pb islands are also observed for pb deposition on si(111 ) when the substrate temperature exceeds @xmath0  150  k @xcite , while layer - by - layer growth is achieved from 100  k @xcite down to 16  k @xcite .",
    "the 2d films grown on ge(001 ) are metastable and their long range order can be increased by short annealing to @xmath0  190  k after lt pb deposition . upon annealing at higher temperature",
    ", the films are always irreversibly decomposed by fragmentation into uncorrelated 3d islands at any pb film thickness .",
    "metastability is also observed for ag films on gaas(110 ) at thickness higher than 6  ml . in this case",
    "the flat ag islands formed by lt deposition are seen to coalesce into a flat wetting film upon annealing to room temperature @xcite .",
    "further annealing to 670  k irreversibly decomposes the ag film into 3d mound - like islands .",
    "the `` electronic growth '' model qualitatively describes the lt layer - by - layer growth of pb on ge(001 ) , but a detailed calculation of the interface energetics would be needed to explain the observed larger stability of the even - layer pb films ( odd layer stability is predicted for pb atoms @xcite ) .",
    "an atomistic model of the diffusion and growth mechanism is still missing . the mechanism of funneling @xcite , proposed for the pb / si(111 ) system @xcite , does not seem to work in the present case ( not exclusively , at least ) .",
    "in fact , the absence of surface diffusion would lead to a high island density , that , even if smoothed by the funnelling effect , would yield a large density of point defects , as a consequence the has reflectivity would be strongly reduced @xcite . on the contrary the has reflectivity is extremely high ( two order of magnitude higher than on the ge(001 ) surface ) and the pb(111 ) domains display a mean size of several hundreds of ngstroms .",
    "quantum size effects have been observed to affect both the surface charge density and the surface relaxation of the growing pb film .",
    "the strongest effect is the apparent variation of the step height as measured by has @xcite .",
    "in fact , the he turning point at the pb(111 ) surface is displaced along the surface normal according to the in - vacuum decay of the electronic charge .",
    "adjacent terraces of different height level display different decays of their surface charge density since they accommodate a different number of qws @xcite .",
    "the apparent step height , as measured by both has and stm , is thus affected since these investigation techniques are only sensitive to the surface charge density .",
    "the displacement of the charge density drives the displacement of the ionic cores , thus affecting the surface relaxation @xcite . by xrd experiments ,",
    "the extent of the structural qse has been measured .",
    "step height variations up to 5 - 6  %   have been determined , as opposed to 20  %   obtained by the has measurements . although smaller than the displacement of the he turning point , the displacement of the topmost nuclear plane is non negligible , as previously thought @xcite .",
    "most importantly , the topmost layer effectively follows the direction of the charge density displacement , thus opening the way to the manifestation of other qses .",
    "a sizeable variation of the surface relaxation may lead to the variation of the elastic force constant between the first and second topmost layers , thus affecting the acoustic vibrations .",
    "the dispersion of low energy surface phonons has been measured by inelastic has at different pb film thickness .",
    "appreciable differences among the phonon frequencies have been detected throughout the @xmath63 and @xmath29 direction of the first surface brillouin zone .",
    "however , these differences could not be unambiguously correlated with the observed cyclic relaxations of the pb topmost layer .",

    "<S> most of the attention was dedicated to high temperature film growth of semiconductors ( to fabricate electronic devices ) , at present the deposition of metals at low substrate temperature is the most attractive field for investigating the correlation between the structural and electronic properties of the film . in heteroepitaxial films , </S>",

    "<S> thus , the interplay between the structural and electronic lengthscales of the metallic film can be put in evidence . in addition , </S>",
    "<S> low temperature growth of metal on metal surfaces is also increasingly employed in the study of magnetic systems thanks to the possibility of inhibiting intermixing processes .    </S>",
    "<S> typically , electronic effects are not observed upon deposition on semiconductors or insulators at room temperature ( rt ) . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , most metals display a cluster growth behavior , either in a wolmer - weber , or in a stranski - krastanov mode . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal energy at the metal / semiconductor interface is usually high enough to allow metal adatoms to migrate uphill at the island step edges , thus to explore various thermodynamical configurations . </S>",
    "<S> both the tendency to reduce the interface area and that to reduce the ratio between the cluster area and its volume may favor the formation of three - dimensional ( 3d ) metal clusters . </S>",
    "<S> any electronic effect due to size confinement is then smeared out by the inhomogeneous spatial and size distribution of the clusters . </S>",
    "<S> a possible path for growing films with a smoother morphology is to inhibit the uphill flow of the deposited atoms by lowering the substrate temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this route has been shown to allow a certain degree of control in the morphology of the growing films leading to the formation of regular patterns of islands with homogeneous size and shape , or even to layer - by - layer growth . </S>",
    "<S> such controlled non - equilibrium morphology can display the effects originated by the quantum confinement of the metal electrons . </S>",
    "<S> these phenomena , referred to as quantum size effect ( qse ) , are clearly manifested by the appearance of quantum well states ( qws ) in thin metal films and nanoislands @xcite , as well as by the spin density waves observed in heterogeneous magnetic systems @xcite , which give rise to the exchange magnetic coupling in layered systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> qse were first observed by jaklevic and coworkers , who measured the tunnelling current of thin pb electrodes @xcite , while the qws were directly observed by valence band photoemission from single layer metal films @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> later on , qws have been measured by photoemission in several metal films on both metal @xcite and semiconductor substrates @xcite .    in general , when the thickness @xmath1 of a metal film is comparable with the fermi wavelength @xmath2 of the film electron gas , cyclic variations of the surface charge density and work function are expected as the film thickness approaches an odd multiple of @xmath3 @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> pb is certainly a suitable candidate to display strong qses , since its bulk interlayer spacing @xmath4   , along its preferred growth orientation [ 111 ] , is @xmath5 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> deviations of the physical properties in thin pb films from the bulk ones are thus expected with a bi - layer periodicity .    the first evidence of such oscillatory behavior dates back to the works by jalochowski and bauer , who measured the electrical resistivity @xcite , valence band photoemission @xcite and the rheed reflectivity @xcite during pb deposition on si(111)-(7@xmath67 ) and si(111)-au(6@xmath66 ) at low temperature . </S>",
