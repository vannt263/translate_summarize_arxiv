    "it is well known that some bacteria are not sensitive to antibiotics ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this state , called _ persistence _ , is not permanent and each bacterium can switch during its lifetime from persistent to susceptible and back to persistent many times ( see for instance @xcite ) . in the persistent state",
    "it does not reproduce , while in the susceptible state it breeds but it is also vulnerable to antibiotics .",
    "two models for this phenomenon have been introduced in @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend these two models by adding ( 1 ) a life cycle for each bacterium ( that is , individual deaths ) and ( 2 ) a possibly positive probability @xmath0 for each bacterium in the susceptible state to survive the action of the antibiotic . in our models",
    "each bacterium has an independent random lifetime represented by two geometrically distributed random variables with parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 for the susceptible state and the persistent state respectively . at certain times ,",
    "that we call _ mass killing times _ or simply _ killing times _ , an antibiotic is injected in the system ; the time intervals are deterministic and equally spaced in the first model and random in the second one",
    ". the action of the antibiotic does not affect the persistent population but it kills each bacterium in the susceptible state independently with probability @xmath6 $ ] ; @xmath7 means that there is no target for the antibiotic in the bacterial genome , @xmath8 means that the antibiotic performs a `` perfect '' mass - killing action in the susceptible state population .",
    "the models in @xcite can be recovered by setting @xmath9 and @xmath8 .",
    "for some values of the parameters ( see section  [ subsec : meanfield ] for details ) , the system dies out almost surely even without the action of the antibiotics ; thus , we need to study only the so - called supercritical case , which is the case when the natural evolution of the system allows survival with positive probability .",
    "in the deterministic killing times case we suppose that the mass - killings occur at times @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",
    "we show that , for every value of the parameters , if the interval @xmath12 between each killing time is too large ( strictly larger than a critical value @xmath13 ) , the bacterial population has a positive probability of survival , while if @xmath14 there is almost sure extinction ( see theorem  [ th : tcritical ] ) .",
    "in particular we are interested in the dependence of @xmath15 from @xmath2 : as @xmath2 converges to @xmath16 , the critical time interval length @xmath15 converges to @xmath16 as well .",
    "thus there is not a positive minimum time interval which guarantees the extinction of the bacterial population for all @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "in particular when the death rate @xmath5 is positive , for some set of parameters it might happen that switching from the susceptible to the resistant state is not a good strategy from the bacteria point of view , since it results in a longer critical time @xmath15 .",
    "in the random killing time case we suppose that the mass - killings are separated by a sequence of independent random time intervals @xmath18 ; this sequence is i.i.d .  and the distribution is given by a probability measure @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a one - parameter stochastically increasing family of probability measures satisfying some mild conditions ( see section  [ sec : random ] for details ) . in this case",
    "we have two randomizations , so to speak : first we choose a realization @xmath21 of the sequence @xmath18 ( we call @xmath21 a _ realization of the environment _ ) and then we have a random evolution of the system with killing times given by @xmath21 . we show that if @xmath22 is large enough ( @xmath23 ) the population survives with positive probability for almost every realization of the environment ( see theorem  [ th : survivalrt ] ) . on the other hands",
    "if @xmath22 is small enough ( @xmath24 ) then the population dies out almost surely for almost every realization of the environment ( see theorem  [ th : extinctionrt ] ) . as in the deterministic case , @xmath25 . roughly speaking ,",
    "since the expected time between two consecutive mass - killings is a nondecreasing function of @xmath22 , we have that , in order to kill almost surely the bacterial population , the expected time between two injection of antibiotics in the system can not be too large .",
    "according to example  [ exmp : ex1 ] , it might happen that @xmath26 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath27 ( where @xmath28 is the geometric distribution ) then @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "this is a modification of the model described in @xcite with the introduction of individual deaths for each type of bacteria ; indeed , it is quite natural to assume that each bacterium has its own life cycle in the absence of an antibiotic treatment .",
    "another addition to the dynamics is the possibility for some susceptible bacteria to survive ( with a fixed probability @xmath0 where @xmath6 $ ] ) the action of the antibiotics .",
    "we denote by @xmath31 and @xmath32 the number of susceptible and persistent bacteria respectively .",
    "this is a 2-type process in continuous time , with the following ( nonnegative ) rates : @xmath33 we recall that a change of state takes place at rate @xmath34 if it takes place after a random geometrically distributed time intervals @xmath35 : due to the lack of memory of the geometric distribution , this means that whenever we start looking at the system , the random time to wait before the change of state is a @xmath36-distributed random variable . in particular the probability of the change of state in an interval of time",
    "@xmath37 $ ] is asymptotic to @xmath38 as @xmath39 goes to @xmath16 .",
    "a more precise construction of the model is given in the proof of theorem  [ th : tcriticalrandom ] .",
    "roughly speaking , we can imagine that each particle has five clocks which ring at geometrically distributed time intervals with parameters @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( the clocks are independent ) .",
    "when a particle is in a susceptible state we have different possibilities : if its @xmath43-clock rings it breeds , if its @xmath44-clock rings it dies and if its @xmath45-clock rings it changes into a persistent state ( it is not affected by the other clocks ) . on the other hand",
    "when a particle is in a persistent state we observe the following behaviors : if its @xmath46-clock rings it dies and if its @xmath47-clock rings it moves to a susceptible state ( and , again , it is not affected by the other clocks ) .    when @xmath48 and @xmath49 the two populations are completely separated , the @xmath50-population is a branching process with mass killing and the @xmath51-population is stable if @xmath52 or dying out if @xmath53 . if @xmath54 and @xmath49 then the @xmath50-population is a branching process with mass killing and individual death rate @xmath55 , while the @xmath51-population survives if and only if either @xmath52 or the @xmath50-population survives .",
    "the interesting case is @xmath56 .",
    "we note that this process is not monotone with respect to the parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 ; on the other hand , it is monotone with respect to the other parameters and to the initial condition .    without the mass deaths caused by the antibiotics ,",
    "the process has a discrete - time branching random walk counterpart ( similar to the one described in @xcite ) . when the antibiotic is injected in the system the dynamics",
    "is the following @xmath57 which means that the number of surviving susceptible bacteria is a binomial - distributed random variable ; thus , at a killing time each susceptible bacterium is killed ( independently from the others ) with probability @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "after a mass killing the system performs a new evolution starting from the survivors . if we consider just the surviving population at these mass killing times , we have a discrete - time process ; it turns out to be a 2-type branching process or a 2-type branching process in random environment depending on our choice of the killing times ( deterministic or random ) .",
    "our choice will be either an increasing sequence of killing times @xmath58 where @xmath59 ( for a fixed @xmath11 ) or @xmath60 where @xmath18 is an i.i.d .",
    "sequence ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "according to @xcite the long - term behavior of this discrete - time branching process depends only of its first - moment matrix @xmath62 . where @xmath63 is the expected number of offsprings of type @xmath64 from a particle of type @xmath65 ( see for instance @xcite ) .",

    "moreover , the basic branching process theory tells us that if the maximum eigenvalue @xmath79 then we have almost sure ( spontaneous ) extinction . hence if the determinant of the matrix @xmath80 we have extinction for all @xmath2 and for any choice of @xmath18 ( even when @xmath81 ) . from now on we assume @xmath82 that implies immediately @xmath83 ; hence @xmath84 .",
