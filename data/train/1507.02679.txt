    "a key observation delineating the end of the reionization epoch is the marked decline beyond @xmath126 in the visibility of lyman - alpha ( ly@xmath0 ) emission seen in continuum - selected galaxies @xcite . as ly@xmath0 represents a resonant transition it is readily scattered by the presence of neutral gas and thus acts as a valuable proxy for the state of the igm .",
    "[ fig1 ]    there are , however , several limitations in using ly@xmath0 as a probe of reionization .",
    "firstly , converting the declining visibility of ly@xmath0 into a neutral gas fraction involves complex radiative transfer calculations and several uncertain assumptions . the currently observed decline ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) implies a surprisingly rapid end to the process @xcite .",
    "secondly , simulations suggest that reionization is likely to be a patchy process @xcite and thus conclusions drawn from the modest samples of spectroscopically - targeted galaxies may be misleading @xcite .",
    "finally , the absence of a ly@xmath0 detection in the spectrum of a proposed high - redshift candidate may simply imply the source is a foreground galaxy ( although the contamination rate for such galaxies is typically very low , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "ideally targets in such studies would be spectroscopically confirmed independently of ly@xmath0 , for example using uv metal lines ( * ? ? ?",

    "* see also @xcite ) .",
    "although observational progress is challenged by the faintness of targets selected in deep fields such as the hubble ultra deep field ( typically @xmath1327 - 28 ) , an important development has been the identification of much brighter @xmath14 candidates from the wider area , somewhat shallower , cosmic assembly near - infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey ( candels , * ? ? ?",

    "in addition to their extreme luminosities ( @xmath18 ) , these three sources have red [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] spitzer / irac colors , indicative of contamination from strong [ o iii ] and balmer h@xmath19 emission .    using the multi - object spectrometer for infra - red exploration ( mosfire , @xcite ) on the keck 1 telescope , we report the detection of a prominent emission line in a further bright candidate drawn from the candels program .",

    "we discuss the likelihood that the line is ly@xmath0 at a redshift @xmath21 making this the most distant spectroscopically - confirmed galaxy .",
    "detectable ly@xmath0 emission at a redshift well beyond @xmath22 raises several questions regarding both the validity of earlier claims for non - detections of ly@xmath0 in fainter sources , and the physical nature of the luminous sources now being verified spectroscopically .",
    "even if these bright systems are not representative of the fainter population that dominate the ionization budget , they offer new opportunities to make spectroscopic progress in understanding early galaxy formation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  [ obs ] we review the object selection , spectroscopic observations , and data reduction .",
    "the significance of the line detection and its interpretation as ly@xmath0 is discussed in  [ lya ] .",

    "calibrations were obtained via long - slit observations of standard a0v stars .",
    "data reduction was performed using the standard mosfire reduction pipeline . for each flat - fielded slit we extracted the 1d spectrum using a 11-pixel boxcar centered on the expected position of the target .",
    "a similar procedure was adopted in quadrature to derive the 1@xmath17 error distribution . to ensure that the derived error spectrum reflects the noise properties of the data , we measured the standard deviation of the pixel - by - pixel snr , which should be unity for a set of independent values drawn from gaussian distributions .",
    "we obtained a value of 1.3 , implying that the errors are slightly underestimated by the pipeline , and corrected the error spectrum accordingly .",
    "data from both nights were co - added by inverse - variance averaging the calibrated 1d spectra .",
    "we also allowed for relative shifts along the slit of 2 pixels ( @xmath40.2 ) and across the slit of 0.2(which affects the expected slit loss correction ) and propagated the associated uncertainty into our error budget .",
    "all reductions and calibration steps were performed independently by two authors ( az , sb ) .    to calibrate the spectra we scaled a vega model to each standard star to determine a wavelength - dependent _ relative _ flux calibration and telluric correction using the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "independent telluric calibrations derived from three standard stars agree to within @xmath46 at the location of the detected emission line .",
    "the _ absolute _",
    "calibration for each night was derived by comparing the spectroscopic magnitude of the stars on the slitmask with photometric measures in the @xmath47-band obtained from the 3d - hst catalog @xcite .",
    "note that this procedure takes into account differential slit losses due to varying seeing .",
    "the absolute calibration factors obtained for the two nights are consistent with differences arising from seeing effects .",
    "we adopt a conservative absolute calibration error of @xmath48 , taking into account the nightly variation , differences between the independent reductions , and other contributions mentioned above . the final 2d and 1d spectra",

    "this significance holds over a range of integration wavelengths both including and excluding the skyline .",
    "additionally , the line is detected independently on each night ( @xmath53 on night 1 , @xmath54 on night 2 ) , despite the changed slit orientation ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . taking the signal / noise on the first night , and assuming it scales as @xmath55/fwhm , where @xmath56 is the exposure and fwhm the seeing , for the second night ( where the exposure was less and seeing worse ) we predict a signal / noise similar to that observed .",

    "although we claim egsy8p7 is the highest - redshift spectroscopically - confirmed galaxy and the first star - forming galaxy secured beyond a redshift of 8 ( c.f . a gamma ray burst at @xmath79 , @xcite ) , its prominent ly@xmath0 emission , detected in only 4 hours , raises several interesting questions about the usefulness of galaxies as tracers of reionization .",
    "the last few years has seen a consistent picture emerging from observational programs charting the visibility of ly@xmath0 beyond a redshift @xmath126.5 in much fainter ( @xmath80 ) galaxies ( @xcite and references therein ) . although the exposure times , selection techniques and observational strategies differ across the various programs , almost 100 faint targets have now been targeted , collectively yielding very few @xmath14 ly@xmath0 detections ( , @xcite ) . in marked contrast , all 3 bright @xmath10 targets in the egs field in table 2 of s compilation now reveal ly@xmath0 emission .",
    "although this bright spectroscopic sample is admittedly modest , the high success rate in finding ly@xmath0 at redshifts where the igm is expected to be substantially neutral ( @xmath470% according to @xcite ) raises two interesting questions .",
    "firstly , do these new results challenge claims made by the earlier fainter ly@xmath0 searches in the same redshift interval ?",
    "is it possible that those campaigns reached to insufficient depths to reliably detect ly@xmath0 emission ? typically such studies adopted the rest - frame ew distribution at @xmath126 published by @xcite and simulated , using their appropriate survey and instrumental parameters , the likely success rate to somewhat higher ew limits of @xmath425 - 50  .",
    "a key issue in understanding whether the  objects are similarly attenuated by the partially neutral igm at @xmath81 is the fiducial @xmath126 ew distribution for these luminosities .",
    "stark et al s ew distribution is based on an analysis of 74 @xmath82 galaxies targeted spectroscopically within the deep goods fields but only 13 reached the uv luminosities being probed here .",
    "@xcite present a smaller sample of 10 spectroscopically - confirmed @xmath126 galaxies from the uds field , several of which are more luminous with ews @xmath59 40  .",
    "a key deficiency in this comparison is that the @xmath82 samples were not selected to have as large ew [ oiii]+h@xmath19 emission implied in the irac [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] color - selected  sample .",
    "@xcite show that ly@xmath0 ews are uniformly extremely large ( 40 160  ) in @xmath122 - 3 galaxies with such large ew optical line emission .",
    "thus it is possible that ly@xmath0 in these @xmath10 galaxies is attenuated .",
    "in addition to the possibility of cosmic variance in the egs field , it may be that such luminous objects at @xmath14 lie in large overdense regions and present a somewhat accelerated view of the reionization process @xcite .",
    "the second question is whether these rarer luminous sources ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) are physically distinct from the fainter population .",
    "adopting the irac red [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] color selection may preferentially select unusually intense line emission with abnormal ionizing spectra capable of creating early bubbles of ionized gas in the local igm ( see also , @xcite ) .",
    "evidence for stronger than usual ionizing spectra in @xmath14 dropouts with known ly@xmath0 emission is provided by the prominent detection of civ 1548   emission in the lensed galaxy at @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "the key issue in this case is the proportion of @xmath84 lyman break galaxies that reveal such prominent irac excesses .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that perhaps upwards of 50% of the photometrically selected galaxies at @xmath126.6 - 6.9 have irac excesses that are comparable in magnitude to those seen in .    in summary , not only",
    "have we pushed the detectability of ly@xmath0 emission to well beyond a redshift @xmath128 , but it seems luminous @xmath85 galaxies selected additionally for their red irac [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] colors have an unusually high success rate of line detection .",
    "we present several reasons why this might contrast with the low yield of detecting ly@xmath0 in intrinsically fainter sources .",
    "regardless of the explanation , it is clear that further spectroscopic follow - up of such examples will yield valuable information on the early development of massive galaxies .",
