    "fix @xmath8 an integer , we have @xmath9 the moduli space of smooth projective curves over @xmath10 of genus @xmath11 with a full level @xmath12-structure , and @xmath13 the moduli space of @xmath4-dimensional principally polarized abelian varieties over @xmath10 with a full level-@xmath12 structure . in this paper",
    "we treat them as the moduli schemes over @xmath10 of the corresponding moduli functors .",
    "no specific choice of the level @xmath14 is made because it is only imposed to assure the representability , which plays no essential role in our study .",
    "the torelli morphism @xmath15 sends a curve @xmath1 in @xmath16 to its jacobian @xmath17 endowed with its canonical polarization .",

    "there are shimura subvarieties ( cf .",

    "they are also called special subvarieties or shimura subvarieties of hodge type .",
    "these subvarieties are totally geodesic , and they are locally symmetric , i.e. , uniformized by hermitian symmetric domains equivariantly embedded in @xmath33 .",
    "a more natural description of shimura subvarieties involves the language of shimura subdata , which will be presented later in section [ subsection shimura varieties and shimura subvarieties ] . in particular ,",
    "the shimura subvarieties of dimension zero in @xmath0 are exactly the cm points , i.e. , points parameterizing cm abelian variety .",
    "any shimura subvariety contains a zariski dense subset of cm points .    when @xmath34 , the torelli morphism is of dense image .",
    "it was conjectured by coleman @xcite that when the genus @xmath4 is sufficiently large , there should be at most finitely many cm points contained in the open torelli locus @xmath35 .",

    "[ oort conjecture ] for @xmath4 large , there does not exist any shimura subvarieties of strictly positive dimensions contained generically in the torelli locus @xmath36 .",
    "the andr - oort conjecture predicts that a closed geometrically irreducible subvariety in a shimura variety is a shimura subvariety if and only if it contains a zariski dense subset of cm points .",

    "although coleman made his conjecture for @xmath37 , counterexamples have been found for @xmath38 ( cf .",
    "however , if one aims at the non - existence of shimura subvarieties of a certain `` type '' specified by some algebraic constructions with @xmath4 sufficently large , then much more evidence is known .",
    "for instance , dwork - ogus @xcite , de jong - noot @xcite and moonen - oort @xcite studied shimura subvarieties arising from cyclic covers of @xmath39 using @xmath40-adic hodge theory .",
    "kukulies @xcite studied rational shimura curves with strictly maximal higgs field using viehweg - zuo s characterization and the sato - tate conjecture for modular curves . in @xcite",
    "the second and the third named authors studied shimura curves of mumford type using the arakelov inequality of higgs bundles",
    ".    in @xcite hain studied the oort conjecture using properties of mapping class groups to rule out locally symmetric subvarieties in @xmath0 of high ranks .",

    "hain s treatment does not apply to these shimura subvarieties .",
    "but they contain shimura curves , and they become the main object of our study based on slope properties of higgs bundles on curves .",
    "the decomposition of canonical higgs bundles on shimura subvarieties , especially on shimura curves , plays an essential role in this paper , cf .",
    "section [ subsection higgs bundles on shimura varieties ] . roughly speaking , for @xmath48 a smooth closed curve ,",
    "the canonical higgs bundle @xmath49 on @xmath1 is the hodge bundle on @xmath1 given by the universal family of abelian varieties restricted over @xmath1 . from the simpson correspondence",
    "it follows that this higgs bundle is completely determined by the complex representation of the fundamental group @xmath50 on the de rham cohomology of the abelian variety .",
    "the canonical higgs bundle thus decomposes into @xmath51 , with @xmath52 the maximal unitary higgs subbundle corresponding to the maximal subrepresentation on which @xmath50 acts through a compact unitary group .",
    "these higgs bundles are induced by the universal family of abelian varieties , and thus they are of the form @xmath53 with @xmath54 following hodge decomposition of abelian varieties ( here we follow @xcite and @xcite for the convention on hodge types , where our @xmath55 is recognized as @xmath56 in complex geometry ) .",
    "this decomposition extends to the logarithmic higgs bundle on a smooth compactification @xmath57 of @xmath1 by joining a divisor @xmath58 , i.e. , @xmath59 with its @xmath60-part being @xmath61 .",
    "viehweg and the last named author @xcite have obtained a numerical control on the slope of @xmath62 :    [ arakelov ( in)equality ] let @xmath48 be a smooth closed curve , such that in some smooth compactification @xmath63 of @xmath0 , the closure @xmath57 of @xmath1 is a smooth projective curve .",
    "then in the decomposition of the logarithmic higgs bundle @xmath64 with @xmath65 and @xmath66 the maximal unitary higgs subbundle , we have the following arakelov inequality @xmath67 moreover , if @xmath1 is a shimura curve , then the equality holds in and @xmath68 is poly - stable , i.e. , it is a direct sum of stable bundles with the same slope .    on the other hand ,",
    "if a shimura curve @xmath1 is contained generically in the torelli locus @xmath20 , then we can construct a commutative diagram @xmath69^{j_b}\\ar[d ] & c\\ar[d]^\\cap\\\\ { \\mathcal{m}}_g\\ar[r]^{j^\\circ } & { \\mathcal{a}}_g}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is the normalization of the pull - back @xmath71 in @xmath16 .",
    "the morphism @xmath72 gives rise to a relative @xmath70-curve @xmath73 , which is a surface fibred over @xmath70 by curves of genus @xmath4 .",
    "it admits a compactification into a fibration @xmath74 of semi - stable curves over the smooth compactification @xmath75 of @xmath70 , and the morphism @xmath76 extends naturally to @xmath77 .",
    "on @xmath75 we have the sheaf @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the relative canonical sheaf .",
    "it is a locally free sheaf on @xmath75 of rank @xmath4 , and admits a decomposition @xmath80 with @xmath81 semi - stable and @xmath82 unitary ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . using xiao s technique on the slope inequality of fibred surfaces , we derive an upper bound for @xmath83 , hence the following theorem    [ exclusion of shimura curves ] let @xmath84 be a curve with the higgs bundle decomposition @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the maximal unitary higgs subbundle . if @xmath85 then @xmath1 is not contained generically in the torelli locus .",
    "if moreover @xmath1 is a shimura curve , then it suffices to require @xmath86 , or equivalently , @xmath87 .    according to the above result together with (",
    "* theorem a ) , we shall say that the oort conjecture for shimura curves of the extremal cases have been solved : the case @xmath88 , i.e. , @xmath89 , also called curves with strictly maximal higgs field , has been dealt with in @xcite ; and the opposite case , namely the canonical higgs bundle having a large unitary higgs subbundle , is treated in the above theorem .",
    "however the techniques involved are totally different . for a shimura curve @xmath1",
    "contained generically in the torelli locus , in @xcite we excluded @xmath1 by establishing a strict arakelov inequality contradiction to the equality in under the assumption @xmath88 using miyaoka - yau s theorem and moriwaki s slope inequality on fibred surfaces ; here we obtain a bound on the rank of the unitary higgs subbundle by using the poly - stability of @xmath90 and xiao s technique of the slope inequality for fibred surfaces .",
    "our main theorems focus on shimura subvarieties in @xmath0 that contain shimura curves .",
    "if @xmath41 is such a shimura variety that contains a zariski dense subset of shimura curves satisfying the condition in theorem [ exclusion of shimura curves ] , then @xmath41 is not contained generically in @xmath20 .",
    "the shimura subvarieties we work with are either of @xmath3-type or of @xmath7-type , namely they are defined by shimura subdata @xmath91 of the following forms :    @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is a non - degenerate hermitian space over a cm field @xmath94 with totally real subfield @xmath95 , such that @xmath96 is of signature @xmath97 along one single embedding @xmath98 , and is definite along the other embeddings ;    @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is a non - degenerate quadratic space over a totally real field @xmath95 , such that @xmath101 is of signature @xmath102 along one single embedding @xmath98 , and definite along the other embeddings .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , we know that in each case the shimura subvariety @xmath41 defined by @xmath103 contains shimura curves , in fact shimura subvarieties in each codimension .",
    "the homomorphisms @xmath104 are rational symplectic representations in the sense of @xcite , and they characterize many geometric properties of the embeddings @xmath105 . on the other hand , the canonical higgs bundles @xmath106 on the shimura subvariety @xmath41",
    "is determined by the representation of @xmath107 , which is determined by @xmath108 because @xmath107 is essentially a congruence subgroup in @xmath109 .",
    "we can thus compute the decomposition of @xmath106 using the symplectic representations , and our main results are :    [ main theorem ] let @xmath110 be a shimura subvariety of @xmath3-type ( @xmath111 ) , with @xmath112 for some hermitian space @xmath113 over a cm extension @xmath114 subject to the constraints of signatures as above .",

    "the key point is to restrict the symplectic representation @xmath108 to @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the shimura subdatum defining some shimura curve @xmath1 in @xmath41 , and compare the rank of unitary part @xmath52 of @xmath49 with the inequality in theorem [ exclusion of shimura curves ] .",
    "in fact we do obtain a more general inequality for the rank @xmath52 for the restriction of a general symplectic representation @xmath108 , cf .",

    "the shimura subvarieties of @xmath7-type are defined by spin groups , and the symplectic representations are always @xmath115-primary of spinor type when no trivial subrepresentation is allowed .",
    "furthermore , when restricted to a shimura curve @xmath1 , the maximal unitary part @xmath52 of @xmath49 is completely determined by the contribution from the embeddings @xmath131 along which the quadratic spaces are definite .",
    "hence the conclusion is simpler :    [ main theorem in the orthogonal case ] let @xmath110 be a shimura subvariety of @xmath7-type @xmath132 , with @xmath99 for some quadratic space @xmath113 over a totally real field @xmath95 subject to the natural constraints of signatures as above .",
