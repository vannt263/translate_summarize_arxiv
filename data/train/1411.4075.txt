    "some observational support for this process has been found in objects like the o4 star @xmath11 puppis ( cassinelli et al .",
    "2001 ; kahn et al . 2001 ) .",
    "but if the star has a strong magnetic field then harder x - rays ( kt @xmath2 2 kev ) may be produced in shocks near the magnetic equator via magnetic wind confinement ( babel & montmerle 1997 ; ud - doula & owocki 2002 ) .    in the case of wn@xmath0o binaries , the nitrogen - type wn star may also be an x - ray source since several apparently single wn stars have been detected in x - rays with typical luminosities l@xmath4 @xmath1 10@xmath12 - 10@xmath13 ergs s@xmath7 ( skinner et al . 2010 ; 2012 ) .",
    "their x - ray spectra usually show both a soft and hard x - ray component .",
    "the soft emission could arise in radiative wind shocks , similar to that theorized for single o stars ( gayley & owocki 1995 ) .",
    "however , the origin of the hard x - ray component in putatively single wn stars is so far unexplained .",

    "2006 ) .    even though single wc stars have so far eluded x - ray detection , wc@xmath0o binaries have been detected as strong x - ray sources as well as wn@xmath0o binaries .",
    "the most extensively studied wr@xmath0o binaries are the brightest in x - rays and are believed to produce a substantial fraction of their x - ray emission from colliding wind shocks , namely @xmath16 vel ( wc8 @xmath0 o7.5 ; p@xmath3 = 78.5 d ; willis , schild , & stevens 1995 ; skinner et al .",

    "an x - ray study of short - period wr @xmath0 o binaries ( p@xmath3 @xmath17 23 d ) based on archival data was presented by zhekov ( 2012 ) who argued for the presence of a colliding wind shock component .",
    "the x - ray emission of wr@xmath0o binaries is almost always unresolved with existing telescopes and typically includes both a soft and hard component .",
    "at least some of the hard emission ( kt @xmath2 2 kev ) is thought to originate in colliding wind shocks ( cherepaschuk 1976 ; prilutski & usov 1976 ; usov 1992 ) .",
    "but for wn@xmath0o systems this may not be the whole story since apparently single wn stars without known companions always show a hard component in their spectra .",
    "thus , the wn star itself may contribute to the x - ray emission of wn@xmath0o binaries .",
    "disentangling the stellar and colliding wind x - ray contributions from wr@xmath0o binaries based on the spectrum of a spatially unresolved source is challenging because the various contributions are superimposed in the composite spectrum .",
    "high - resolution x - ray grating spectra can provide constraints on where individual emission lines are formed in the system but such spectra are only available for a few of the brightest wr@xmath0o binaries .",
    "another approach to identifying separate x - ray contributions in wr @xmath0 o binaries is to observe eclipsing systems .",
    "when the orbit is highly inclined ( i.e. viewed nearly edge - on ) , orbital modulation of the x - ray emission can occur .",
    "for example , the hottest colliding wind shock plasma is expected to have temperatures of several kev for typical terminal wind speeds of o - type and wr stars ( @xmath18 @xmath1 1000 - 2000 km s@xmath7 ) and is predicted by numerical hydrodynamic models to lie on the line - of - centers between the stars ( luo et al . 1990 ;",

    "1992 ) . in that case",
    ", the hottest colliding wind plasma will be visible near quadrature but will be partially occulted in high - inclination systems during primary and secondary eclipse .",
    "thus , the observed emission measure of the hot plasma component should vary with orbital phase .",
    "additionally , large variations in x - ray absorption are anticipated with higher absorption occurring at orbital phases when the wr star is in front of the o star and the system is viewed through the dense metal - rich wr wind .",
    "such orbital variations in absorption have indeed been observed in well - studied binaries such as @xmath16 vel and wr 140 .",
    "we present here the results of a _",
    "observation of the short - period eclipsing wolf - rayet binary cq cep covering more than half an orbit .",
    "our primary objectives were to search for x - ray modulation that should occur during eclipses if hot localized colliding wind shock plasma is located on the line - of - centers and make comparisons between the observed x - ray properties and analytic predictions from colliding wind theory .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , no significant x - ray modulation was detected .",
    "the properties of our target cq cep ( = wr 155 = hd 214419 ) are summarized in table 1 .",
    "it is a close binary system consisting of a wn6 nitrogen - type wr star and a o9 companion .",
    "the luminosity class of the o9 companion remains rather uncertain because spectral features clearly associated with the o star have been difficult to identify in optical spectra .",
    "the o star was classified as o9 ii - ib by marchenko et al .",

    "thus , cq cep is detected as a point source at _ chandra _ s spatial resolution .",

    "no large - amplitude x - ray variability is seen but fluctuations at the @xmath342@xmath35 level are present in the broad - band light curve .",

    "based on the above tests , variability is unlikely but not strictly ruled out .    as a further check for variability , we computed the median photon energies ( e@xmath39 ) and hardness ratios ( h.r . ) for the first and second halves of the observation .",

    "the values for both halves are nearly identical .    the x - ray count rates based on light curves binned at 2000 s intervals are given in table 3 for three different energy bands .",
    "a slight increase in count rate in the second half of the observation is seen in all three bands .",
    "the increase amounts to @xmath2310% in the broad ( 0.2 - 8 kev ) and soft ( 0.2 - 2 kev ) bands and @xmath237% in the hard ( 2 - 8 kev ) band .",
    "since the small increase is present in all bands it could well be real but the significance of the increase is low , amounting to at most 0.5@xmath35 - 0.6@xmath35 .",
    "in contrast , the optical light curve is clearly variable .",
    "a large drop in brightness of @xmath230.5 aca mag occurs during the first 15 ks with minimum brightness at t = 14.46 @xmath34 0.02 ks after the start of the observation .",
    "this minimum corresponds to orbital phase @xmath28 = 0.023 using the time - of - minimum light equation of de97 :  hjd = 2450267.43158 @xmath410.00077 @xmath0 ( 1.6412299 @xmath34 0.0000002 d)@xmath42e , where the o star is in front of the wr star at @xmath28 = 0.0 .",
    "thus , the minimum in the _ chandra _ optical light curve occurred @xmath233.26 ks _ after _ the time predicted by the de97 elements ( fig .",
    "this difference can not be explained by the small formal uncertainties in the elements of de97 . the uncertainty in their hjd reference date could account for 66 s of the difference and their orbital period uncertainty",
    "could account for an additional 64 s when propagated forward to the epoch of the _ chandra _ observation ( 3718.92 orbits ) .",
    "this raises the question of whether the true uncertainties in the orbital period of de97 may actually be larger than their quoted values or whether the period might be variable .",
    "both possibilities are discussed further in section 5.5 .",
    "the _ chandra _ acis - s spectrum of cq cep is shown in figure 3 .",
    "several emission lines and line blends are present including high - temperature lines such as s xv at 2.46 kev ( maximum line power temperature log t@xmath43 = 7.2 k ) , ar xvii at 3.13 kev ( log t@xmath43 = 7.3 k ) , ca xix at 3.90 kev ( log t@xmath43 = 7.5 k ) , and a faint feature at 6.67 kev that is likely weak fe k@xmath44 dominated by fe xxv ( log t@xmath43 = 7.6 k ) .",
    "emission features at lower energies that trace cooler plasma include possible detections of the ne ix he - like triplet at 0.91 kev ( log t@xmath43 = 6.6 k ) and ne x at 1.02 kev ( log t@xmath43 = 6.7 k ) .",
    "thus , the x - ray plasma spans a broad range of temperatures from @xmath14 mk up to @xmath140 mk .",
    "since the spectrum becomes heavily absorbed at e @xmath17 0.7 kev , any cooler plasma at t @xmath17 4 mk that may be present would have escaped detection .",
    "the bottom panel of figure 3 shows a comparison spectrum of the wn6 star wr 134 based on a previous _ chandra _ acis - s observation ( skinner et al .",
    "it is noteworthy that its spectrum is quite similar to that of cq cep despite the fact that wr 134 is not known to be a binary .",
    "this suggests that the wn star in cq cep dominates the observed x - ray emission .",
    "we have attempted to fit the cq cep spectrum with a variety of different xspec models .",
    "we have focused on optically - thin plasma models ( @xmath45 and its variable abundance version @xmath46 ) since the x - ray spectra of wn stars and close wr@xmath0o binaries are generally well - fitted by such models ( skinner et al .",
    "2010 , 2012 ; zhekov 2012 ) .",
    "but we have also considered a constant - temperature plane - parallel shock model ( @xmath47 and its variable abundance version @xmath48 ) . all models included a solar - abundance absorption component to account for interstellar medium ( ism ) absorption and its value was held fixed at n@xmath49 = 2.2 @xmath29 10@xmath50a@xmath51 ( gorenstein 1975 ) = 4.4 @xmath29 10@xmath50 @xmath52 corresponding to a@xmath51 = 2 mag .",
    "we also allowed for additional absorption that is usually present in wr star x - ray spectra as a result of their winds .",
    "wind abundances for the o star are expected to be near - solar in composition whereas wn wind abundances are h - depleted and n - enriched ( van der hucht , cassinelli , & williams 1986 ) .",
    "our fits confirmed that excess absorption is present in cq cep and models with two plasma temperature components ( 2 t ) generally provided better fits as determined by the @xmath38 statistic than models with only one temperature component ( 1 t ) .",
    "table 4 summarizes three representative spectral fits using a 2 t optically thin plasma model and one fit using a 2 t plane - parallel shock model .",
    "each model includes a fixed ism absorption component as well as separate independent wind absorption components for the cool and hot plasma . in model",
    "a all abundances were assumed to be solar while in model b the source and wind - absorption abundances were held fixed at the generic values for wn stars given by van der hucht et al .",
    "in model c the source and wind - absorption abundances of the cool component were fixed at solar values ( as expected for the o star ) and those for the hot component were fixed at generic wn values .",
    "model d uses the same abundance assumptions as model c but the 2 t optically thin plasma model is replaced by a 2 t plane - parallel shock model .",
    "even though the abundance assumptions for the models in table 4 are different , the best - fit plasma temperatures ( kt ) , absorbed fluxes , and unabsorbed x - ray luminosities ( l@xmath4 ) are all quite similar .",
    "thus , the model results are not very sensitive to abundance assumptions .",
    "all models require a cool plasma component at kt@xmath53 @xmath23 0.6 kev and a hotter component at kt@xmath54 @xmath23 2 - 3 kev .",
    "these temperatures are comparable to those found for other close wn@xmath0o binaries ( zhekov ( 2012 ) as well as single wn stars ( skinner et al . 2010 ; 2012 ) .",
    "the models in table 4 give log l@xmath4 = 33.25 - 33.48 ergs s@xmath7 ( 0.3 - 8 kev ) at d = 3.5 kpc .",
    "these values place cq cep at the high end of the x - ray luminosity range observed for wr stars ( pollock 1987 ) .",
    "the above l@xmath4 range overlaps that of other close wn@xmath0o binaries ( fig .",
    "2 of zhekov 2012 ) but is also similar to that of a few of the brightest putatively single wn6 stars such as wr 20b and wr 24 ( skinner et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "of the models in table 4 , the 2 t @xmath48 model ( model d ) provides a slightly better fit than the other models as gauged by @xmath38 statistics .",
    "it also yields a somewhat higher value of kt@xmath55 and l@xmath4 than the 2 t @xmath46 models .",
    "the slightly better fit obtained with the @xmath48 model is due to its ability to fully reproduce the fluxes of the stronger emission line complexes , which are generally underestimated by the @xmath46 models .",
    "this may be a clue that non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) effects taken into account by the @xmath48 model ( borkowski , sarazin , & blondin 1994 ) are important but higher resolution grating spectra capable of resolving individual line complexes ( e.g. he - like triplets ) would be needed to confirm this .",
    "finally , we note that the absorbed flux measured from the best - fit @xmath48 model applied to data from the first half of the exposure is 4% less than that obtained by fitting data from the second half .",
    "specifically , the absorbed fluxes measured from the first and second halves in the 0.3 - 8 kev range and their 90% confidence ranges are ( in units of 10@xmath56 ergs @xmath52 s@xmath7 ) :   f@xmath57 = 2.03 [ 0.80 - 2.25 ] and f@xmath58 = 2.11 [ 0.93 - 2.32 ] . the small increase in measured flux provides additional support for the conclusion based on count rates ( table 3 ) that the source was slightly brighter during the second half of the observation , but the 90% confidence ranges of the measured fluxes are large enough to be consistent with no flux variability at all .",
    "in order to compare the observational results with predictions of colliding wind theory we must first determine the location of the stagnation point where the shock contact discontinuity surface intersects the line - of - centers between the stars .",
    "as a first approximation we assume radial outflow , neglect orbital motion ( sec .",
    "5.2 ) , and consider one - dimensional wind momentum balance .",
    "if the distance from the center of the o star to the stagnation point is @xmath59 and the distance from the center of the wr star to stagnation point is @xmath60 = @xmath22 - @xmath59 , where @xmath22 is the binary separation , then the necessary condition for wind ram balance is ( eq . [ 1 ] of stevens et al .",
    "1992 )     @xmath61    if the winds were accelerated near - instantaneously to their terminal speeds v@xmath62 then the wind parameters in table 1 would give @xmath59 = 2.35 r@xmath24 @xmath17 @xmath63 so ram balance could not be achieved and the higher momentum wr wind would shock onto the surface of the o star .",
    "but because of the close binary separation of cq cep the winds are not expected to reach terminal speed along the line of centers .",
    "thus it is appropriate to use standard wind velocity profiles in equation ( 1 ) of the form @xmath64 = @xmath65^{\\beta}$ ] where @xmath66 @xmath23 @xmath00.8 - @xmath01.0 is typical for hot stars ( lamers & cassinelli 1999 ) .",
    "defining the dimensionless ratios p@xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69/@xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 for @xmath73 ( de97 ) the above becomes    @xmath74~ .\\ ] ]    the above equation is analogous to equation ( 4 ) of gayley , owocki , & cranmer ( 1997 ; hereafter goc97 ) except that we have not assumed the wr wind to have reached terminal speed at the stagnation point .",
    "the last term on the right accounts for radiative braking of the wr wind by the o star radiation field where @xmath75 is the reflection fraction of the o - star radiative momentum deposited into the wr wind near the interaction region .",
    "the ratio of wind to radiative momentum of the o star is @xmath76 = ( @xmath77 = 0.46 , where @xmath78 is the speed of light and @xmath79 = 1.16 @xmath29 10@xmath80 l@xmath24 ( de97 ) is the luminosity of the o star .",
    "the case @xmath75 = 0 corresponds to no braking and reasonable limits on @xmath75 for the present case are 0.5 @xmath10 @xmath75 @xmath10 2 , where the upper limit @xmath75 @xmath23 2 corresponds to complete back reflection ( goc97 ) .    adopting @xmath22 = 20.4 r@xmath24 and r@xmath81 @xmath23 r@xmath82 = 8.2 r@xmath24 yields @xmath83 @xmath23 0.4 and the above equation must be satisfied for 0.4 @xmath17 @xmath84 @xmath17 0.6 to achieve ram balance between the stars . if braking is ignored ( @xmath75 = 0 ) and the right side of the above expression is considered as a function @xmath85 versus @xmath84 then it is easily seen that @xmath86 = 0 , @xmath87 = 1 , and @xmath88 as @xmath89 0.6 .",
    "thus , if the two stars had identical winds then ram balance would be achieved at the midpoint @xmath84 = 0.5 .",
    "but for cq cep we have @xmath90 = 58.5 ( table 1 ) and ram balance can only be achieved at or near the wr star surface ( @xmath91 0.599 ) where the wr wind is at effectively zero speed .",
    "this extreme condition tells us that the o star wind lacks sufficient momentum to achieve balance between the stars and again we conclude that the wr wind overpowers the o star wind and the shock forms at or very near the o star surface ( @xmath92 0.4 ) .",
    "if radiative braking is included then the above conclusion does not change even for complete back reflection ( @xmath75 @xmath23 2 ) .    in the above ram balance calculation",
    ", we have assumed a wind velocity law of the form @xmath64 = @xmath65^{\\beta}$ ] and for @xmath93 we have used the photospheric radius .",
    "that is , we have implicitly assumed that the winds of both stars are accelerated from zero speed starting at the photosphere .",
    "this may be an oversimplification for wr stars for which there is some observational evidence that the wind has already reached appreciable speed at the photosphere ( e.g. schmutz 1997 ) .",
    "the precise form of the wind acceleration law in the optically thick part of the wind below the photosphere is not well - known but the acceleration is thought to be slow ( @xmath94 5 ; nugis & lamers 2002 ) .",
    "it is obvious that if the wr wind is already at non - zero speed at the photosphere , then the wr wind momentum between the stars is greater than we have assumed above , strengthening the conclusion that the wr wind dominates the o star wind .      in its basic formulation , colliding wind shock theory predicts that the hottest plasma occurs along the line - of - centers between the stars near the stagnation point . for an adiabatic shock the maximum plasma temperature",

    "cherepashchuk ( 1990 ) suggested that the discrepancy could be accounted for if the wind is clumped .",
    "if most of the mass is lost in the form of clumps then the effective mass - loss rate of the unclumped ( smooth ) gas between the clumps that interacts to form the colliding wind shock is lower than the total mass - loss rate . in the cherepashchuk ( 1990 )",

    "even if the companion radius were as small as 6.6 r@xmath24 it would only reduce the @xmath123 prediction ( eq . [ 4 ] ) by 0.2 dex .",
    "thus , even a companion radius at the low end of the estimated range corresponding to a b0 star is not sufficient to resolve the x - ray luminosity discrepancy with colliding wind predictions .      in the framework of the colliding wind shock picture ,",
    "the x - ray emission is expected to change as the o star passes in front of the wr star . as discussed above ( sec .",
    "5.1.1 ) , the stagnation point will lie at or near the surface of the o star and plasma at maximum shock temperatures kt@xmath105 @xmath23 1.8 kev should be present along the line - of - centers .",
    "since the cq cep orbit is viewed at high inclination ( i.e. nearly edge - on ) , any hot plasma at the stagnation point along the line - of - centers will be partially occulted when the o star is in front because in that viewing geometry the stagnation point lies behind the o star and is obstructed from full view .",
    "lower x - ray absorption is also anticipated when the o star is nearly in front _ if _ the x - rays originate between the stars because the emission is then viewed through the o star wind , which is less dense than the wr wind .",
    "shortly after the o star passes in front and the system moves toward quadrature , any hot colliding wind shock plasma located near the line - of - centers should be revealed along with an increase in observed hard - band flux ( or count rate ) .",
    "but our comparison of the count rates and observed fluxes between the first half of the observation when the o - star was in front and the second half show that any effect on the x - ray emission by the eclipse at @xmath28 = 0 was quite small , with the observed ( absorbed ) flux in the second half being at most 4% greater than the first half .",

    "our fits of separate spectra extracted for the first and second halves show no significant change in the column density associated with the cool x - ray component .",
    "since wind absorption affects mainly lower energy photons , it is the cool component that would be most affected by any changes in column density toward the source .",
    "since the expected orbital variability was not detected we must conclude that any existing hot colliding wind plasma is not strongly localized along the line - of - centers .",
    "it is very likely that the geometry of the wind interaction region in cq cep is affected by the close binary spacing and orbital motion . on the basis of asymmetric optical eclipse light curves",
    ", de97 concluded that the system is in an overcontact configuration but harries & hilditch ( 1997 ) found that their light curve solutions required only marginal contact . in either case , the region between the stars will be tightly confined and this will affect wind launching and acceleration .",
    "if wind development between the stars is impeded then there may be no hot colliding wind shock plasma on or near the line - of - centers .",
    "however , a colliding wind shock may still be able to form away from the line - of - centers where the wr wind is able to accelerate as it flows around the o star ( see fig .",
    "3 of luo et al .",
    "1990 ) . in this oblique geometry",
    "the maximum predicted shock temperature will be less than for a head - on wind collision because the wr wind velocity vector is no longer perpendicular to the shock interface and the projected value @xmath97 in eq .",
    "( 3 ) is reduced .",
    "since the predicted value of kt@xmath105 @xmath23 1.8 kev for a head - on collision is already at or below the observed hot plasma temperature ( kt@xmath54 ) , any further downward correction due to oblique geometry would only worsen the agreement .",
    "orbital motion will also modify the shape of the wind interaction region in cq cep and will affect wind energetics as a result of enhanced turbulence , as has been shown in hydrodynamic simulations of the similar close binary system v444 cyg ( wn5@xmath0o6 ; p@xmath3 = 4.2 d ) .",
    "the simulations of walder ( 1995 ) show that the wind interaction zone assumes a spiral shape and is shifted in the direction opposite to orbital motion .",
    "the orbital speed of the stars in cq cep is @xmath130320 km s@xmath7 assuming that the stars have similar masses ( de97 ) .",
    "this is considerably less than the terminal wind speeds ( @xmath12000 km s@xmath7 ) but is similar to that adopted for the wr star in v444 cyg by walder ( 1995 ) .",
    "detailed hydrodynamic simulations are needed to model the geometry of the wind interaction region in cq cep .",
    "the development of realistic simulations will be challenging because they will need to take into account wind development and acceleration in the confined region between the stars , radiative cooling , and orbital motion .",
    "a crucial question to be answered by future simulations is whether hot colliding wind plasma at the observed _ chandra _ temperatures of @xmath12 - 3 kev can form in this close system and , if so , is its spatial distribution consistent with the very low levels of x - ray variability ( if any ) seen in the _ chandra _ data during optical eclipse .",
    "the absence of significant x - ray variability in cq cep over half an orbit is unusual for a wr@xmath0o binary but at least one other close wr binary shows similar behavior .",
    "the wn3 @xmath0 ob system wr 46 has a complex optical light curve which shows multiple photometric periodicities of @xmath230.14 - 0.3 d as well as radial velocity variations of 0.329 d ( 7.9 hr ) .",
    "the variability may be related to binarity as discussed in detail by gosset et al . ( 2011 ) but other possible causes such as non - radial pulsations have also been proposed ( hnault - brunet et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "a 70 ks _ xmm - newton _ observation of wr 46 was analyzed by gosset et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , covering two cycles of the 0.329 d period .",
    "they detected both cool and hot plasma in the x - ray spectrum at temperatures similar to those found here for cq cep , but an additional very soft component at kt @xmath23 0.2 kev may also be present .",
    "based on statistical timing analysis in several different energy bands , they concluded that x - ray variability was possibly present but only in the lowest energy band ( 0.2 - 0.5 kev ) and of low significance .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ data were also analyzed by hnault - brunet et al .",
    "their broad - band ( 0.3 - 10 kev ) epic @xmath131 light curve shows low - amplitude fluctuations at the @xmath3420% level but no results of statistical variability tests that would substantiate real variability and quantify its significance were given .",
    "their x - ray periodogram shows a peak at a period p = 9.0 @xmath34 2.5 hr and a similar period may be present in uv light curves .",
    "hnault - brunet et al .",
    "argued that non - radial pulsations may be responsible for the low - level variability .",
    "however , a further examination of the wr 46 _ xmm - newton _ data was carried out by zhekov ( 2012 ) who applied @xmath38 analysis and concluded that the x - ray light curves are consistent with a constant count - rate source . based on the above studies ,",
    "it is clear that any x - ray variability present in the wr 46 _ xmm - newton _ data is of low significance and even if short - period ( @xmath18 - 9 hr ) modulations exist they may not be due to binarity .",
    "the presence of hot plasma with little or no significant x - ray variability is reminiscent of our findings for cq cep and suggests that the hot x - ray plasma may not arise solely in a colliding wind shock , at least if the assumption that the hot plasma originates entirely in the close wn@xmath0ob binary itself is correct .    to explain the _ hot _ x - ray plasma in wr 46 , gosset et al .",
    "suggested that a third more distant companion may be present and is orbiting the central wn3 @xmath0 ob system with a period longer than a few weeks .",
    "if the third object were a massive star , then the interaction of its wind with the aggregate wind of the close binary could give rise to colliding wind shock emission for which orbital x - ray variability on timescales of less than a few weeks would not be expected .",
    "this scenario could account for the lack of significant x - ray variability of wr 46 on @xmath11-day timescales as well as the presence of hotter plasma because the winds would be at or near terminal speeds when colliding .",
    "similarly , a hypothetical third star in a wider orbit could be invoked to explain the hot plasma and lack of short - term ( @xmath11 day ) x - ray variability in cq cep .",
    "gaposchkin ( 1944 ) speculated that a third body could be responsible for perceived small changes in the time between primary and secondary minima in the optical light curve of cq cep .",
    "however , an attempt by borkovits & hegeds ( 1995 ) to find a good third - body orbit for cq cep based on historical optical data was not successful and no optical nebulosity was detected around cq cep in the study of miller & chu ( 1993 ) .    until compelling evidence for a third star orbiting cq cep is presented , the possibility of intrinsic hot x - ray plasma from one or both stars in the near - contact wn@xmath0ob system originating by a process other than colliding winds should not be dismissed .",
    "a point not to be overlooked here is that x - ray luminosities of wn stars for which no evidence of binarity has yet been found lie in the range log l@xmath4 = 31.14 ( wr 16 ) - 33.57 ( wr 20b ) ergs s@xmath7 ( skinner et al . 2010 ; 2012 ) .",
    "this range easily encompasses the luminosities of both wr 46 ( log l@xmath4 = 32.77 ; zhekov 2012 ) and cq cep ( table 4 ) .",
    "it is of course possible that some of the putatively single wn stars detected previously in x - rays are close binaries with unseen companions , but until that is demonstrated it would be premature to discount intrinsic emission from the wn star or its wind as a non - negligible contributor to the x - ray emission detected from cq cep .",
    "the current state of knowledge provides very few theoretical alternatives to colliding winds for explaining the existence of hot plasma ( kt @xmath2 2 kev ) in wr@xmath0o binaries .",
    "one plausible alternative is based on the magnetically - confined wind shock ( mcws ) model that has been used to explain hot plasma in some o stars such as the o7 v star @xmath132 ori c ( babel & montmerle 1997 ; hereafter bm97 ) . in this picture",
    ", sufficiently strong stellar magnetic fields can confine the ionized wind and channel it toward the magnetic equator where the oppositely - directed streams collide to form a mcws .",
    "this mechanism could be operating in the o9 component of cq cep but very strong b fields would be needed to confine the much stronger wind of the wn star .",
    "the magnetic field strength needed to confine the o - star wind can be estimated using the confinement parameter @xmath133 = b@xmath134r@xmath135/@xmath136v@xmath62 where b@xmath137 is the field strength at the magnetic equator ( ud - doula & owocki 2002 ) . for @xmath133 @xmath23 1",
    "the wind is marginally - confined by the b - field . adopting a radius r@xmath138 = r@xmath82 = 8.2 r@xmath24 for the o star in cq cep and using the wind parameters in table 1",
    ", marginal wind confinement requires b@xmath137 @xmath1 150 g and larger fields are needed for strong confinement",
    ". a @xmath1150 g field would be sufficient to account for the observed x - ray luminosity ( eq . [ 10 ] of bm97 ) and the o9 terminal wind speed could produce mcws plasma temperatures of several kev ( eq . [",
    "4 ] of bm97 ) .",
    "since the mcws is predicted to form near the magnetic equator of the o star , the hot plasma should be at least partially occulted as the wn star passes in front ( @xmath28 = 0.5 ) , with an accompanying drop in the hard - band count rate .",
    "there is some suggestion of a small decrease in the hard - band count rate near @xmath28 @xmath23 0.5 in fig . 2-bottom",
    "but the change is of low significance ( @xmath231.5@xmath35 ) and we lack phase coverage beyond @xmath28 = 0.52 .",
    "if the o9 star is producing hard x - rays in a mcws then rotational x - ray modulation may be present , as is the case for @xmath132 ori c which shows periodic modulations at its 15.4 d rotation period .",
    "longer time monitoring of cq cep would be needed to determine if periodic x - ray variability is present , but none is obvious in our short @xmath11-day x - ray light curve .",
    "one argument against the scenario in which most of the x - rays originate in the o9 star via a mcws is the strong resemblance of the _ chandra _ x - ray spectrum of cq cep to that of the presumably single wn6 star wr 134 ( fig .",
    "3 ) . similarly , stickland et al .",
    "( 1984 ) have noted that the _ iue _ spectrum of cq cep is `` virtually indistinguishable from that of single wn7 stars and shows no clear evidence of any ob companion spectrum '' .",
    "the above similarities suggest that it is the wn star and not the o - type companion that plays the dominant role in the x - ray ( and uv ) emission of cq cep .",
    "the time of primary optical minimum ( @xmath28 = 0 ) predicted by the results of de97 is 3.26 ks _ earlier _ than the minimum observed by _",
    "this difference is too large to explain on the basis of the formal uncertainties in the published de97 elements .",

    "interestingly , harries & hilditch ( 1997 ) found a similar difference of 1.56 ks and in the same sense ( i.e. their observed time is earlier than predicted by wa83 ) .",
    "one possible explanation for the above discrepancies is that the orbital period of cq cep is variable .",
    "the question of orbital period variability has been investigated in previous studies but the results are contradictory .",
    "wa83 found that 68 years of optical data analyzed in their study were consistent with no period change greater than an annual fractional change of @xmath15 @xmath29 10@xmath8 .",
    "in contrast , the study of antokhina et al .",

    "as the conflicting results summarized above show , the presence of any orbital period variability in cq cep remains an open question .",
    "wa83 pointed out that other factors besides period variability such as eclipse asymmetries could be contributing to discrepancies in reported periods . the period change found by a82",
    "is much too small to explain the difference between the time of _ chandra _ optical minimum and that predicted by the de97 results , and in any case the period change is of opposite sign needed to resolve the discrepancy .",
    "but , a small error in the value of the adopted orbital period from de97 could easily explain the difference , as shown below .",
    "three of the most recent p@xmath139 determinations for cq cep are 1.64122299 @xmath34 2e-07 d ( de97 ) , 1.6412436 @xmath34 9e-07 d ( wa83 ) , and 1.641249 d ( a82 ; no error given ) .",
    "the average of these three values is @xmath140 = 1.6412408 ( @xmath08.2e-06,@xmath401.1e-05 ) d where the uncertainties simply reflect the range in published values .",

    "if instead we start with the observed time of _ chandra _ minimum light ( hjd = 2456371.20268 @xmath34 0.00023 [ utc ] ) and adopt the reference date for primary minimum of de97 ( hjd = 2450267.43158 @xmath34 0.00077 ) then the time difference divided by 3719 full orbits gives p@xmath141 = 1.6412400 @xmath34 1.5e-7 d , where the error takes into account the uncertainty in the de97 epoch date and in the time of _ chandra _ minimum light .",
    "this period differs by only 9e-07 d from the average value given above .",
    "thus , the difference between the time of optical minimum observed by _",
    "chandra _ and that predicted by the results of de97 can be explained by adopting an orbital period p@xmath141 = 1.6412400 @xmath34 1.5e-7 d , which is slightly larger than the value determined by de97 but in quite good agreement with the average orbital period determined from three previous studies .",
    "further optical monitoring of cq cep would be worthwhile to confirm the result of a82 that the period is slowly decreasing and , if so , to determine if the rate - of - change is stable .",
    "a reliable determination of the rate - of - change in the period can be used to constrain the mass - loss rate and the rate at which mass is flowing from the wn star onto the o star , as shown by a82 for cq cep and by khaliullin ( 1974 ) for the short - period wn@xmath0o binary v444 cyg .",

    "_ chandra _ has detected luminous x - ray emission from cq cep .",
    "a simultaneous _ chandra _ optical light curve clearly shows a deep eclipse when the o star passed in front of the wn star .",
    "however , little or no x - ray variability was seen during the observation .",
    "the _ chandra _ acis - s spectrum shows numerous blended emission lines and is quite similar to spectra of apparently single wn6 stars such as wr 134 .",
    "the spectrum can be fitted with either 2 t optically thin plasma models or 2 t plane - parallel shock models .",
    "such models give a cool component plasma temperature kt@xmath53 @xmath23 0.6 kev and a hot component temperature kt@xmath54 @xmath23 2 - 3 kev , similar to temperatures observed in single wn stars and other close wn@xmath0o binaries .",
    "the unabsorbed x - ray luminosity of cq cep log l@xmath4 = 33.25 - 33.48 ergs s@xmath7 is at the high end of the range observed for wr stars .",
    "this value is similar to that of other close wn@xmath0o binaries but is also comparable to that of the most luminous single ( non - binary ) wn stars .",
    "the absence of significant x - ray variability during optical eclipse of this high - inclination system is contrary to expectations if the hottest plasma originates in a colliding wind shock and is localized along the line - of - centers between the stars .",
    "the predicted temperature of a colliding wind shock formed by the wr wind impacting the o star at sub - terminal speed is marginally consistent with the lower values determined from x - ray spectral fits but the predicted x - ray luminosity is at least an order of magnitude higher than observed .",
    "thus , we find discrepancies with colliding wind model predictions that remain to be explained .",
    "the lack of significant x - ray variability in cq cep during optical eclipse at @xmath28 = 0 ( o star in front ) provides compelling evidence that the x - ray plasma is extended on scales comparable to or larger than the binary system ( binary separation @xmath120 r@xmath24 ) .",
    "radiative shocks distributed far out in the winds of one or both stars remain a plausible explanation for the cool plasma in cq cep",

    "we derive here an expression for the colliding wind x - ray luminosity in close wr@xmath0o binaries such as cq cep where the stellar radii @xmath143 and r@xmath144 are not much less than the distance @xmath22 between the centers of the two stars . in this case",
    "the magnitude and direction of the wr wind velocity vector change across the shock interface at the o star surface .",
    "we assume a radial spherically - symmetric wr wind which overpowers the o star wind so that a colliding wind shock forms at the o star surface .",
    "as shown in figure 4 , the wr wind velocity vector @xmath145 impacts the o star surface at a distance @xmath100 from the center of the wr star .",
    "the velocity component perpendicular to the shock interface is @xmath146 .",
    "we assume a standard wind velocity profile @xmath147^{\\beta}$ ] where @xmath18 is the terminal speed of the wr wind .",
    "the wind mass density is @xmath148 .",
    "as figure 4 shows , a point on the o star surface at distance @xmath100 corresponds to a specific value of @xmath44 , where @xmath44 is the angle formed at the o star s center between the line - of - centers and the point on the o star surface .",
    "the dependence of @xmath100 on @xmath44 is given by the law of cosines as @xmath149 = @xmath150 .",
    "adopting @xmath44 as the independent variable , the maximum x - ray luminosity is obtained by integrating the energy flux crossing the shock over the portion of the o star surface that is intercepted by the wr wind ,                          where the wr terminal wind luminosity is @xmath115 = ( 1/2)@xmath116 and cos @xmath152 = @xmath153 . the quantity @xmath122 in square brackets in eq .",
