    "superconductors and superfluids which require two phase variables to describe their condensates can be said to possess a u(1)@xmath0 u(1 ) symmetry .",
    "one example , which has been known for a long time , is a thin film of the a - phase of @xmath1he superfluid @xcite in a perpendicular magnetic field , where the spin - triplet cooper pairing allows for the possibility of the cooper pair spin rotating in the plane perpendicular to the field .",
    "more recently , sr@xmath2ruo@xmath3 has been identified as an electronic analogue of @xmath1he - a @xcite and as such can allow for a u(1)@xmath0u(1 ) symmetry @xcite .",
    "a u(1)@xmath0u(1 ) symmetry can also arise in bose condensates of atoms with nonzero integer spins , commonly known as ` spinor condensates ' @xcite .",
    "lastly , `` pair - density - wave '' ( pdw ) order - long known as the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) phase @xcite - can also allow for a u(1)@xmath0u(1 ) symmetry as the superconducting and cdw phases are intertwined there .",
    "recent , it was proposed @xcite that experimental studies of the effects of the unidirectional spin and charge ordering ( ` stripe order ' ) in the cuprate superconductors la@xmath6ba@xmath7cuo@xmath3 and la@xmath8nd@xmath9sr@xmath7cuo@xmath3 @xcite shows evidence for the pdw order .",
    "another candidate system for a pdw order is cecoin@xmath10 under strong magnetic field @xcite .",
    "possible phase transitions in various systems with pdw order has been studied @xcite .    a condensate with a u(1)@xmath0u(1 ) symmetry allows for the existence of a half - quantum vortex ( hqv ) with only @xmath11 , rather than @xmath12 , winding in the overall phase of the superfluid , @xmath13 . for a charged superfluid ,",
    "i.e. _ a superconductor , a hqv binds flux of @xmath14 , which is half the flux of the conventional abrisokov vortex , @xmath15 .",
    "this is a consequence of the existence of an extra phase variable @xmath16 , where at long distances , the condensate consists of two components with phases @xmath17 , regardless of the physics that gives rise to @xmath16 .",
    "the single - valuedness of the condensate wave function around a vortex is thus maintained even with @xmath18 as long as it is also accompanied by a @xmath19 winding in @xmath16 , thus making a hqv topologically stable .",
    "conversely , observation of hqvs indicates the existence of the additional phase degree of freedom in the condensate , and thus serves as an indicator of the structure of the order parameter .",
    "the hqvs in chiral triplet superconductors have attracted particular interest in recent years stemming from the possibility that they will exhibit the simplest non - abelian statistics @xcite .",
    "more complex non - abelian statistics of hqvs of spin-3/2 spinor condensate has also been studied @xcite .",
    "is temperature and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the phase stiffnesses for @xmath16 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "note that without any change in the phase stiffness ratio @xmath22 , the hqv lattice can be stable at non - zero temperature even when it is not stable at @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath23 is increased if the core interaction between hqvs is repulsive , so the upper phase diagram is for the case that the vortex core interaction favors hqvs over full quantum vortices . ]",
    "although they are topologically stable , this does not guarantee that hqvs will ever occur in equilibrium systems .",
    "indeed , in superconductors , hqvs have never been detected in bulk , due to the energetics issues pointed out in ref . to the best of our knowledge , the recent apparent experimental detection of half - quantum fluxoids in mesoscopic sr@xmath2ruo@xmath3 samples @xcite is , to date , the only successful experimental observation of a hqv in a single - crystal superconductor .",
    "however , in a lattice of hqvs , the lattice constant effectively plays the role of the system size , so a system close to @xmath24 effectively becomes mesoscopic , as was shown in ref . .",
    "the @xmath4 structure of the hqv lattice obtained for this case is essentially the same as that obtained for spinor condensates in refs . .",
    "it is also analogous to the vortex ",
    "antivortex lattice configurations proposed in refs . for a two - dimensional ( 2d ) superfluid .",
    "the main result of our paper is the vortex lattice phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : phase diagram ] ) that shows the hqv lattice favored by non - zero temperature .",
    "studies of the stability of the hqv lattice previously have focused on the @xmath4 case , _",
    "i.e. _ on energy rather than free energy . there has not been a thorough investigation of the possibility that the hqv lattice may be stabilized by its larger entropy . while barnett ,",
    "mukerjee and moore considered the possibility of a finite temperature transition from a full vortex lattice to a fractionalized vortex lattice @xcite , they only treated the case in which this is a result of the temperature dependence of the ratio of the stiffnesses of the two phase variables . although this is ultimately also an entropic effect , it is special to the case in which @xmath16 is associated with spin degrees of freedom with only weakly broken su(2 ) invariance . in the present work , we will show that regardless of any physical origin of @xmath16 , entropy favors the hqv lattice , giving rise to a finite temperature phase transition from the full vortex lattice to the hqv lattice .",
    "in addition , we find the possibility that the entropy stabilized hqv lattice can have a different structure than the hqv lattice at @xmath4 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , after comparing the free energy of a full vortex with a pair of hqvs , we show that a hqv lattice has higher entropy than a full vortex lattice by analyzing lattice phonon modes . in section iii",
    ", we show the energy competition between the triangular full vortex lattice and hqv lattices with different structures . in section iv",
    ", we demonstrate that the hqv lattice at finite temperature is always dynamically stable in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we conclude with a discussion in section v.",
    "results of this paper are based on the minimal model of a superconductor in the london limit with a u(1)@xmath0u(1 ) symmetry : @xmath25 % & = & \\frac{1}{2 } = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m^*}\\left[\\rho\\left(\\nabla \\theta - \\frac{2e}{\\hbar c}{\\bf a}\\right)^2 + \\kappa(\\nabla \\alpha)^2\\right ] % \\nonumber\\\\ % & = & \\frac{\\phi_0 ^ 2}{32 \\pi^3 \\lambda^2}\\left[\\left(\\nabla \\theta - \\frac{2e}{\\hbar c}{\\bf a}\\right)^2 + \\frac{\\kappa}{\\rho}(\\nabla \\alpha)^2\\right ] , \\label{eq : hqv_ham}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the cooper pair mass , @xmath27 is the london penetration depth , and @xmath21 and @xmath20 are the stiffness for @xmath13 and @xmath16 , respectively . in this minimal model , we ignore any consideration of crystalline symmetry of the superconductor .",
    "we can treat the case of a neutral superfluid by setting @xmath28 ( and consequently @xmath29 ) in all results .",
    "we first show that a full quantum vortex with @xmath30 , that is the @xmath12 phase winding only in the overall phase , can always lower its free energy by fractionalizing into a pair of hqvs , one with @xmath31 , the other with @xmath32 , because this fractionalization will increase the configurational entropy .",
    "we emphasize here that this holds even in the case where the pair of hqvs have _ higher _ energy at @xmath4 .",
    "as far as @xmath4 energy is concerned , in the limit @xmath29 @xmath33,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the system size , @xmath35 is the separation between two hqvs , and @xmath36 is the core radius , and we assume @xmath37 ( in which limit the core energies are negligible ) .",
    "the pair of hqvs have higher energy if @xmath38 . however , dissociation of a full quantum vortex into a pair of hqvs results in an entropy increase @xmath39 from the number of the possible hqv pair configurations with mean separation @xmath35 .",
    "this implies that even when @xmath40 , the free energy @xmath41 of the pair is lower at temperatures @xmath42 @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) temperature .",
    "this observation motivates us to compare the free energies of the full quantum vortex lattice and the hqv lattice in the case in which the latter has higher ground state energy .",
    "the regime we will examine is @xmath45 , where screening of the charge current ( _ i.e. _ the finite size of @xmath46 ) is not a dominant effect but all vortex cores are still well separated .",
    "we begin with a heuristic argument : it follows from the equipartition theorem that , in the limit @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the debye frequency for the phonons of the vortex lattice , the lattice entropy is @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the number of phonon modes . for fixed total number of @xmath13 vortices , @xmath51 ,",
    "piercing the system , the hqv lattice has twice as many phonon modes , @xmath52 , as the full quantum vortex lattice , since one full quantum vortex is topologically equivalent to a pair of hqvs .",

    "the full quantum vortex lattice in this picture is recovered in the limit @xmath61 . in this paper",
    ", we consider the cases with highest symmetry , as shown in fig.([fig : vortex lattice ] ) : a honeycomb structure analogous to graphene or an interlaced rhombus where a @xmath32 hqv lies at a midpoint between two @xmath31 hqvs .",
