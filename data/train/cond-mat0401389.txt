    "semiconductor quantum dots are now routinely obtained using electrostatic gates or etching processes to pattern a two dimensional electron gas formed in some heterostructure ( typically gaas / algaas).@xcite many of their sometimes surprising properties are now reasonably well understood from a qualitative or statistical point of view,@xcite and it is now realistic to think about using these quantum dots for some specific purpose , such as spin filtering,@xcite current or spin pumping,@xcite or in the context of quantum information.@xcite    in this context , it becomes important to go beyond a qualitative or statistical description , and to develop tools able to predict quantitatively the properties of a specific quantum dot for given parameters . for isolated or weakly connected dots  the coulomb blockade regime ",
    "the coulomb interaction between electrons plays an important role and has to be taken into account properly .    a method of choice in this regard",
    "is the density functional approach,@xcite which has been widely used in theoretical modeling of quantum dots . @xcite more specifically , since it is necessary to describe correctly the spin degree of freedom , we have in mind a spin density functional , where each density of spin @xmath0 , with @xmath1 corresponding to majority and minority spins , are treated as an independent variable . how this can be achieved in practice for a dot containing up to four hundred electrons , and for an @xmath2 parameter as high as four ,",
    "has been demonstrated in a series of papers.@xcite    one striking feature of these calculations , however , is that the qualitative picture which emerges is somewhat unexpected in view of previous results . indeed , within a statistical approach and assuming the classical dynamics within the nanostructure is sufficiently chaotic",
    ", one can model the wave functions in the quantum dot using random matrix theory ( rmt ) .",
    "if furthermore the coulomb interaction is treated within the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , it is possible to derive various statistical quantities,@xcite such as the distribution of spacing between coulomb blockade conductance peak , or the probability of occurrence of non - standard spins [ that is , not zero ( not one - half ) for even ( odd ) particle number ] .",
    "it turns out , for instance , that the spin density functional calculations give a larger number of `` high '' spins than was predicted within rmt plus rpa modeling.@xcite such discrepancies could originate from a variety of causes , ranging from the the statistical behavior of the kohn - sham wave functions to an intrinsic failure of one or the other approach .",
    "the goal of this paper is to clarify this issue .    for this purpose , we need a way to understand , or to organize , the numbers obtained from the full - fledged spin density functional theory ( sdft ) .",
    "this can be done using the strutinsky approximation to dft discussed in ref .  , up to straightforward modifications to include the spin variable .",
    "the strutinsky approach is an approximation scheme , developed in the late sixties in the context of nuclear physics , in which the interference ( or shell ) effects are introduced perturbatively.@xcite it has been since then used in many subfield of physics,@xcite including the calculation of the binding energy of metal clusters.@xcite standard treatments are usually limited to first - order corrections ; in this case , it is similar to the harris functional @xcite familiar to the dft literature . here ,",
    "in contrast , we use the second - order approximation @xcite developed in ref .  .",
    "we shall see that the second - order strutinsky scheme turns out to be extremely accurate in some circumstances .",
    "furthermore , even when it is less precise , which happens in conjunction with the occurrence of `` spin contamination '' in the sdft calculations , it still provides a qualitatively correct statistical description .",
    "the second - order strutinsky corrections can be cast in a very natural form:@xcite in fact , they amount to taking into account the residual ( screened ) interactions between quasiparticles in a landau fermi liquid picture .",
    "they are thus amenable to treatment by the same rmt approach as was used previously for rpa , providing an analogue of the `` universal hamiltonian '' in the case of sdft .",
    "since within the strutinsky approximation the quantum dot properties are relatively transparent , we will then be in position to discuss the difference between sdft results and those obtained from rmt plus rpa .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : strut ] , we briefly review the strutinsky approximation as it applies to spin density functional theory . in section",
    "[ sec : t&c ] , we consider more specifically the local density approximation from this perspective , and in particular the screened potential that it implies .",
    "section  [ sec : ksvsst ] covers in detail the specific case of a model quantum dot with quartic external confining potential .",
    "this model is used to investigate the accuracy of the strutinsky approximation for various electron densities . in section  [ sec : fl ] , we discuss how the fermi liquid picture emerging from the strutinsky approximation scheme can be used , in conjunction with a random plane wave model of the wavefunctions , to analyze the peak spacing and spin the distributions resulting from the sdft calculation .",
    "this framework also makes it possible to discuss the mechanism of spin contamination .",
    "finally , in the last section we come back to the original question motivating this work and make use of what we understand from the strutinsky approximation to discuss the discrepancies between sdft calculations and rpa plus rmt predictions .",

    "the presence of metallic gates can be taken into account by including an image term in addition to the bare coulomb interaction , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the distance between the top confining gate and two - dimensional electron gas . the image term in the interaction kernel",
    "greatly reduces classical coulomb repulsion between electrons at a distance larger than @xmath12 so that the electron density far from the boundary is quite uniform .",

    "up to the introduction of the spin indices , the derivation of this approximation follows exactly the same lines as the spinless case discussed in details in ref . .",
    "we shall therefore not reproduce it here , but rather try to emphasize what exactly are the assumptions made in deriving the approximation , and then merely write down the expression we shall use in the following sections .      the basic idea of the strutinsky energy correction method is to start from smooth approximations , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , to the dft energy @xmath27 and electronic density @xmath28 .",
    "then , fluctuating terms are added perturbatively as an expansion in the small parameter @xmath29 in the original work of strutinsky @xcite various ways of constructing the smooth approximation have been considered .",
    "the most natural choice for @xmath30 turns out to be the solution of the thomas - fermi equation @xmath31 = { \\mu_{\\rm tf}}^{\\sigma}\\ ] ] coupled with @xmath32 $ ] .",

    "this takes the form @xmath36   = { { \\cal t}_{\\rm tf}}^{(0 ) } [ n^{\\alpha},n^{\\beta } ] + { { \\cal t}_{\\rm tf}}^{(1 ) }      [ n^{\\alpha},n^{\\beta } ] $ ] with @xmath37 & = & \\frac{1}{2 n(0 ) } \\int \\ ! d { { \\bf r}}\\big[n^{\\alpha}({{\\bf r}})^2 + n^{\\beta}({{\\bf r}})^2\\big ] \\label{eq : ttf0 } \\\\ { { \\cal t}_{\\rm tf}}^{(1 ) } [ n^{\\alpha},n^{\\beta } ] & = & \\frac{\\eta}{8 \\pi n(0 ) } \\int \\!\\!d { { \\bf r}}\\left[\\frac{(\\nabla n^{\\alpha})^2}{n^{\\alpha } } + \\frac{(\\nabla n^{\\beta})^2}{n^{\\beta}}\\right ]      \\label{eq : ttf1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 the density of states for 2-dimensional systems and @xmath39 a dimensionless constant taken here to be @xmath40 .",
    "such a choice for the kinetic energy functional correctly takes into account the pauli exclusion principle , and thus that an increase in kinetic energy is required to put many particle at the same space location , but fails to include fluctuations associated with quantum interference .    to illustrate this ,",
    "let us for a short while the assume @xmath41 , i.e.  only the first term @xmath42 of the thomas - fermi kinetic energy is taken into account .",

    "the weyl approximation is , however , only the leading term in a semiclassical expansion of the smooth part of the density of states , and higher - order corrections in @xmath54 can be added in a systematic way . the standard way to choose @xmath55 @xcite is such that eq .",

    "( [ eq : strut_corr ] ) , be described as the sum of a large non - fluctuating classical - like term , a one - particle energy contribution computed for some effective confining potential , and finally a residual interaction term @xmath311 .",
    "this latter would , however , be understood as originating from a weak interaction @xmath312 which in the random phase approximation can be shown to be just the rpa screened potential,@xcite but should be understood more properly as the residual interaction between quasi - particles in landau fermi liquid spirit .",
    "we shall thus refer to this latter description as the `` rpa '' approach , although this is slightly inappropriate .         while the strutinsky approximation to sdft gives a residual interaction which can be understood as a first - order perturbation ( without exchange ) in terms of the spin dependent potential eq .",
    "( [ eq : vsc ] ) , in contrast one has in the `` rpa '' approach a residual interaction arising from the perturbative corrections in some @xmath313 ( including both direct and exchange ) as well as possibly higher - order terms which turn out to be important for time - reversal invariant systems ( the cooper series ) . under this assumption and following exactly the same analysis as the one leading to eq .",
    "( [ eq : uh_lsda ] ) , one gets for the mean residual interaction term in the rpa approach @xmath314 ( again @xmath315 but would be 1 if time - reversal invariance were broken ) .    in eq .",
    "( [ eq : uh_rpa ] ) , the parameter @xmath316 is equal to @xmath317 , where the fermi circle average is defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : mean_fc ] ) and @xmath318 is the fourier transform of @xmath312 . more properly however , one should understand @xmath316 as being related to fermi liquid parameter @xmath319 through @xmath320 in first - order perturbation theory , @xmath102 would be equal to @xmath316 , but screening associated with higher oder terms in the cooper channel somewhat reduces this value . an analysis following the lines of ref .",
    "suggests that @xmath321 with @xmath322 the fermi momentum and @xmath323 the typical size of the system .",
    "we shall assume this in the following discussion , bearing , in mind that this is true only `` up to logarithmic accuracy '' .",
    "the remarkable point here is that @xmath324 is actually the same thing as @xmath325 , in the sense that the landau fermi liquid parameter @xmath325 can be interpreted as the second derivative with respect to the polarization , at fixed total density , of @xmath326 the exchange correlation energy per particle of the uniform electron gas .",
    "this implies that the term quadratic in @xmath193 of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : uh_lsda ] ) and ( [ eq : uh_rpa ] ) actually do correspond .    as a consequence if we compare fig .",
    "[ fig : level4](b ) , which is obtained from a rmt / rpw simulation with the interaction corresponding to the spin density functional , with fig .",
    "[ fig : level3 ] , obtained in the same way but with an `` rpa''-like interaction , corresponds to an evaluation of the variance of these fluctuations for which we have assumed no screening , and is therefore rather an upper bound .",
    "the fluctuations being in any case rather small , their magnitude does not change the peak spacing distribution drastically ( their main effect is to broaden the sharp peak for odd spacings ) , and a more detailed treatment of the effect of screening of the cooper channel on the fluctuations of the residual interaction term should not change significantly the picture . ] the differences in spin polarization and in odd / even asymmetry for the peak spacing distribution can be almost entirely associated with the different linear @xmath193 terms in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : uh_lsda ] ) and ( [ eq : uh_rpa ] ) .",
    "to get some further insight into the difference between the two approaches , let us consider table  [ table ] which shows the spin distributions for an interaction parameter @xmath262 and various approximations discussed in this paper .",
    "comparing different pairs of lines gives a sense of the importance of the various issues .",
    "for instance , comparing the second line with the third gives an idea of how accurate the rmt / rpw model is for the statistical properties of the real energy levels and eigenfunctions of the quartic oscillator system , since both lines are based on the same spin dependent interaction eq .",
    "( [ eq : vsc ] ) .",
    "the first line compared to the second , on the other hand , is a measure of how well the strutinsky scheme approximates the full sdft calculation .",
    "presumably , most of the difference between these two lines can be associated with the presence of spin contamination in sdft  it is in some sense a measure of the effectiveness of spin contamination in lowering the total spin of the system .",
    "going further down the table , the difference between the third and the two last lines is a measure of the impact of different linear terms in @xmath193 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : uh_lsda ] ) and ( [ eq : uh_rpa ] ) , without screening the cooper channel for the fourth line and with a screened cooper channel [ according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : zeta ] ) ] for the last line of the table .    from table",
    "[ table ] , it appears that within the accuracy of the rmt / rpw modeling , which seems to be around 5% , the sdft result is compatible with an rpa - like approach if the cooper channel is not screened . in other words ,",
    "the fact that @xmath327 is more negative that @xmath328  producing higher spins  is compensated by the effect of spin contamination  which favors lower spins . as seen in ref .",
    ", this compensation between the two effects seems to exist also for higher values of @xmath2 . on the other hand ,",
    "spin contamination is not a sufficiently strong effect to compensate for the absence of screening of the cooper channel .",
    "it remains to decide which of the two approaches is the more correct .",
    "this , in the end , can only be addressed by comparison with exact calculations for quantum dots ( e.g.  quantum monte carlo ) .",
    "one argument that may be considered is that in the presence of a time - reversal breaking term ( i.e. @xmath329 ) , general symmetry considerations impose that the mean value of the residual interaction term is a function of @xmath194 , but not independently of @xmath330 and @xmath233 .",
    "expressions ( [ eq : uh_lsda ] ) clearly do not fulfill this constraint , while eq .",
    "( [ eq : uh_rpa ] ) does .",
    "since , however , spin contamination seems to compensate for this difference it might just be that for time - reversal non - symmetric systems , sdft and rpa basically agree .",
    "on the other hand , the screening of the cooper channel does not seem to be reproduced by the sdft calculations , and this might be the cause of the higher spin found in this approach .",
    "this second order strutinsky approximation has to be distinguished from second order approximations made on the the density functional itself , such as in  : m.  elstner , d.  porezag , g.  jungnickel , j.  elsner , m.  haugk , t.  frauenheim , s.  suhai , and g.  seifert , phys .",
