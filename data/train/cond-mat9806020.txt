    "global optimization is a subject of intense current interest , both scientific and commercial . for example , improved solutions to optimization problems , such as the travelling - salesman problem and the routing of circuitry on a chip , could lead to cost reductions and improved performance.@xcite in the chemistry and physics communities motivation is often provided by the structural insight which can be derived from finding the lowest energy configuration of a ( macro)molecular system .",
    "therefore , the development of better global optimization algorithms is an important task .",
    "it is a challenge which needs to be guided by theoretical insight rather than proceeding on purely empirical or intuitive grounds .",
    "the main difficulty associated with global optimization is the exponential increase in the search space with system size .",
    "one expression of this problem is levinthal s paradox which points out the apparent impossibility of finding the native state of a protein.@xcite the number of possible conformations of a typical protein is so large that it would take longer than the age of the universe to find the native state if the conformations were sampled randomly , even at an unfeasibly rapid rate",
    ". this problem can be more rigorously defined using computational complexity theory.@xcite finding the global minimum of a protein@xcite or a cluster@xcite is ` np - hard ' , a class of problems for which there is no known algorithm that is guaranteed to find a solution in polynomial time .    however , we know that proteins are able to reach their native state relatively rapidly .",
    "the resolution of levinthal s paradox lies in the fact that the search is not random  the paradox results from the implicit assumption that the potential energy surface ( pes ) is flat . in reality",
    ", the topography of the pes is crucial in determining the ability of a system to reach the global minimum.@xcite for example , the system is thermodynamically more likely ( than random ) to be in those regions of the pes that are low in energy , and downhill pathways can guide the system towards certain configurations .",
    "a funnel , a set of downhill pathways that converge on a single low energy minimum , combines these two effects .",
    "it has been suggested that the pes s of proteins are characterized by a single deep funnel and that this feature underlies the ability of proteins to fold to their native state.@xcite indeed it is easy to design model single - funnel pes s that result in efficient relaxation to the global minimum , despite very large configurational spaces.@xcite    therefore , global optimization should be relatively easy for those systems with a single - funnel pes topography . however , there are many systems for which the topography of the pes does not permit escape from the huge number of disordered configurations .",
    "these systems are more likely to form glassy or amorphous structures on cooling . in such cases",
    "it is very difficult for global optimization to succeed .",
    "this is especially true if the optimization method , e.g.  simulated annealing , tries to mimic some physical process , because the natural time scales for the formation of order are much longer than those that can be probed by computer simulation .",
    "it has been suggested that the pes s of such ` glassy ' materials are rough , with many funnels leading to different low energy amorphous configurations , rather than to the crystal.@xcite however , one does not need to have much complexity to make global optimization difficult ; two funnels are enough if the system is more likely to enter the secondary funnel on descending the pes.@xcite in this paper we examine one such example from the realm of atomic clusters and compare it with another much easier problem .",
    "our aims are to pinpoint why many global optimization algorithms are likely to fail for this cluster , to understand the reasons for the success of the ` basin - hopping ' method and to deduce lessons for the design of global optimization algorithms .",
    "in particular , we highlight the influence of the thermodynamics of the clusters on these questions .",
    "a brief description of some of the results has already appeared.@xcite",
    "the lennard - jones ( lj ) potential,@xcite which provides a reasonable description of the interactions between rare gas atoms , is given by @xmath1,\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the pair well depth and @xmath3 is the equilibrium pair separation .",
    "lj clusters have been much used as a test system for global optimization methods that are designed for configurational problems , and it is likely that nearly all the global minima up to 150 atoms have now been found.@xcite most of the global minima have structures that are based upon the mackay icosahedra,@xcite but there are a number of exceptions .",
    "the global minimum is a face - centred cubic ( fcc ) truncated octahedron ( fig [ piccies]a ) , and for 7577 and 102104 atoms the global minima are based on marks decahedra.@xcite these clusters are interesting because the global minima are much more difficult to find by an unbiased global optimization method .",
    "they were all initially discovered by construction using physical insight.@xcite since then the truncated octahedron has been found by a number of methods.@xcite the marks decahedral global minima have only been found by the ` basin - hopping ' approach,@xcite the method we analyse in this paper , and a modified genetic algorithm which searches the same transformed surface.@xcite    -0.3 cm    for the above reasons we choose to examine in more detail the behaviour of , and as a contrast . the global minimum is a complete mackay icosahedron@xcite ( figure [ piccies]c ) , a structure that is easily found by any reasonable global optimization algorithm .    for the second lowest energy minimum is an incomplete mackay icosahedron with @xmath4 point group symmetry ( figure [ piccies]b ) , which lies only @xmath5 higher in energy than the fcc global minimum . as might be expected from their structural dissimilarity ,",
    "the two lowest energy minima are well separated on the pes . using a method which walks over the pes from minimum to minimum via transition states,@xcite we have been able to find paths connecting these two structures .",
    "the lowest energy path that we found is depicted in figure [ 38path].@xcite it clearly shows that there is a large activation energy associated with passage between the two lowest energy minima .",
    "the fcc and icosahedral regions of configuration space represent two distinct funnels on the pes .",
    "the minima at the top of the barrier are from the region of configuration space associated with the liquid - like state ( figure [ 38.mine ] ) . at temperatures below the melting point the boltzmann weights of these states are small implying that there is also a large free energy barrier between the two funnels.@xcite the dynamics confirm this picture ; below the melting point a simulation run started in one of the funnels always remains trapped in that funnel .",
    "0.1 cm    the shapes of the fcc and icosahedral funnels are also rather different . for the fcc funnel",
    "there is a large energy gap ( @xmath6 ) between the truncated octahedron and the next lowest energy minimum .",
    "in contrast there are many low energy icosahedral structures ; indeed there are at least 24 icosahedral minima lower in energy than the second lowest energy fcc minimum ( figure [ 38.mine ] ) .",
    "the fcc funnel is narrow , whereas the icosahedral funnel is wider and has a broad , fairly flat bottom .",
    "0.1 cm    the pes is very different .",
    "all the low energy minima for are based on the mackay icosahedron .",
    "the first three peaks above the global minimum in the probability distribution of minima in figure [ 55.mine ] represent mackay icosahedra with one , two and three surface defects , respectively.@xcite furthermore , the mackay icosahedron is @xmath7 lower than any other minimum .",
    "the pes of has a single deep funnel",
    ".    0.1 cm",
    "to calculate the thermodynamic properties of our clusters we use the superposition method;@xcite in this approach the density of states , @xmath8 , is constructed using information about a set of minima on the pes ( such as those represented in figures [ 38.mine ] and [ 55.mine ] ) .",
    "this choice is motivated by two considerations .",
    "firstly , methods such as multi - histogram monte carlo,@xcite often the method of choice for clusters , are not able to describe the low temperature thermodynamics for correctly because in simulations the cluster is not able to cross the large free energy barrier between the fcc and icosahedral funnels",
    ". it might be possible to overcome this difficulty by using more advanced techniques such as jump - walking@xcite or umbrella sampling,@xcite however these methods can be computationally demanding .",
    "the advantage of the superposition method is that it can be used to calculate _",
    "absolute _ densities of states for different regions of phase space , and therefore there is no need to cross any free energy barrier .",
    "secondly , the superposition method can give greater physical insight into the relationship between the topography of the pes and the thermodynamics .",
    "we review the superposition method here because it will be important later when we formulate the thermodynamic properties of a transformed energy surface , and because some additional developments need to be made before it can be applied to .",
    "the fundamental relation is @xmath9 where the sum is over _ all _ the geometrically distinct minima on the pes , @xmath10 is the density of states of a single minimum @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the potential energy of minimum @xmath11 , and @xmath13 , the number of permutational isomers of minimum @xmath11 , is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the order of the point group of @xmath11 .",
    "this equation is exact and just expresses the division of configuration space into basins of attraction that surround each minimum on the pes.@xcite one difficulty with the above equation is that @xmath10 is not known _ a priori_. however ,",
    "if the basin is assumed to be harmonic then the form of @xmath10 is simple , and using this expression a qualitative picture of the thermodynamics can be obtained.@xcite furthermore , anharmonic expressions for @xmath10 have also been derived which are able to describe the thermodynamics of lennard - jones clusters more accurately.@xcite    the second difficulty with equation ( [ equation : supern ] ) is that for all but the very smallest clusters the sum involves an impractically large number of minima .",
    "hoare and mcinnes,@xcite and more recently tsai and jordan,@xcite have enumerated lower bounds to the number of geometric isomers for lj clusters from 6 to 13 atoms .",
    "this number rises exponentially with @xmath16 .",
    "extrapolating the trend gives for lj@xmath17 an estimate of @xmath18 geometric isomers .",
    "in such a case , as it is not possible to obtain a complete set of minima , one instead has to use a representative sample , which , for example , could be obtained by performing minimizations from a large set of configurations generated by a molecular dynamics trajectory .",
    "however , one needs a way to correct for the incomplete nature of the sample .",
    "this correction can be achieved by weighting the density of states for each _ known _",
    "minimum by @xmath19 , the number of minima of energy @xmath20 for which the minimum @xmath11 is representative .",
    "hence , @xmath21 where the prime indicates that the sum is now over an _ incomplete _ but _ representative _ sample of minima .",
    "the effect of @xmath19 can be incorporated by using @xmath22 , the probability of obtaining @xmath11 in a minimization from a configuration generated by a microcanonical simulation at energy @xmath23 . if the system is ergodic on the time scale of the simulation , then @xmath24 .",
    "hence , @xmath25 since we know the low energy limiting form of @xmath8 , where the contribution of the lowest energy minimum dominates , the proportionality constant in ( 4 ) can also be obtained .",
    "this reweighting technique is analogous to histogram monte carlo,@xcite but instead of determining the configurational density of states from the canonical potential energy distribution , @xmath26 , effectively a density of minima , is found from the microcanonical probability distribution of being in the different basins of attraction .",
    "hence there are some similarities with the microcanonical multihistogram approach of calvo and labastie.@xcite    the accuracy of the method depends on the statistical accuracy of @xmath22 ; this probability distribution needs to be obtained at an energy where all relevant minima are significantly sampled .",
    "this is possible for ; @xcite however , for there is no energy at which both the fcc and icosahedral minima can both be sampled because of the large free energy barrier .",
    "therefore , in the latter case the density of states is obtained by adding two terms : @xmath27 the density of states of the fcc region of phase space , @xmath28 , can be obtained by summing the density of states for all the low energy fcc minima using equation ( [ equation : supern ] ) .",
    "( in fact the summation can be dispensed with since the term from the global minimum is the only term in @xmath28 that ever contributes significantly to @xmath8 . ) at the melting point an cluster samples both the icosahedral and the liquid - like regions of configuration space and so equation ( [ equation : superp ] ) can be used to find @xmath29 .",
    "once @xmath8 has been determined , various thermodynamic quantities can be calculated by the application of standard thermodynamical formulae.@xcite    0.1 cm    the resulting equilibrium thermodynamic properties of are shown in figure [ 38un.therm ] .",
    "the anharmonic expression for @xmath30 was used with the anharmonicity parameters@xcite determined by the technique give in ref . .",
    "as there are many low energy icosahedral minima and as these minima have a lower mean vibrational frequency than the truncated octahedron , the configurational entropy associated with the icosahedral funnel is larger than for the fcc funnel . as a result of this entropy difference",
    "there is a transition from the fcc to the icosahedral regions of configurational space at low temperature .",
    "the transition is centred at a temperature of @xmath31 and gives rise to the small peak in the heat capacity ( figure [ 38un.therm]b ) .",
    "the finite - size analogue of the bulk melting transition occurs at @xmath32 , producing the main peak in the heat capacity.@xcite these transitions are also reflected in the occupation probabilities for the different ` phases ' ( figure [ 38un.therm]a ) .",
    "we can understand the effect these thermodynamic transitions have on global optimization by considering the result of cooling a cluster from the liquid - like state .",
    "the cluster is thermodynamically much more likely to enter the icosahedral funnel on quenching because the free energy associated with the icosahedral structures at the melting point is lower than that associated with the fcc structures .",
    "furthermore , this effect is reinforced by the topology of the pes .",
    "the structure of simple atomic liquids has significant polytetrahedral character;@xcite in contrast fcc structures have no polytetrahedral character , and icosahedra are somewhere in between . as a result of this greater structural similarity ,",
    "the icosahedral funnel is more accessible from the liquid - like state .",
    "( a similar effect has been noted by straley who found that crystallization from a simple liquid is much easier in a curved space , where a polytetrahedral packing is the global minimum , than in normal flat space where a close - packed crystal is most stable.@xcite ) the combined effect of these two features is to make it extremely probable that on cooling the cluster will enter the icosahedral funnel . on further cooling the cluster",
    "will remain trapped in this funnel even when the fcc structures become lower in free energy because of the large free energy barrier between the two funnels .",
    "clearly this behavior will present difficulties for annealing methods , which simply try to follow the free energy global minimum down to zero temperature by gradual cooling .",
    "the only opportunity to find the truncated octahedron by conventional simulation is at high temperature in the narrow window where the fcc structures have a small , but not yet insignificant , probability of being occupied and where the boltzmann weights for the intermediate states , which mediate transitions between the fcc and icosahedral funnels , are large enough to make the free energy barrier surmountable .",
    "indeed , we did observe the truncated octahedron in the microcanonical simulation ( @xmath33 ) from which we obtained the distribution of minima depicted in figure [ 38.mine ] .",
    "however , minimization only led to this structure _ once _ in the entire 0.25@xmath34s run.@xcite    some thermodynamic properties of are shown in figure [ 55un.therm ] .",
    "the partition function for this system was obtained previously in the development of the superposition method,@xcite and it gives very good agreement with thermodynamic properties derived by more conventional means.@xcite there is a single peak in the heat capacity curve corresponding to the melting transition at which the cluster passes from the mackay icosahedron ( perhaps with one or two defects ) into the liquid - like state . for simulations in the middle of this melting region",
    "the cluster passes back and forth between the different states.@xcite similarly , on cooling from the liquid the cluster enters the icosahedral funnel relatively easily .",
    "s single funnel pes presents no thermodynamic obstacles to global optimization .    0.1 cm",
    "the global optimization method that we analyze here belongs to the ` hypersurface deformation ' family of methods.@xcite in this approach the potential energy function is transformed in a way that is hoped to make global optimization easier .",
    "the transformations usually try to lower the number of local minima  thus reducing the search space  and / or the barrier heights between minima  thus increasing the rates of transitions between minima .",
    "however , little attention is usually paid to the effects of the transformation on the thermodynamics of the system .    once the global minimum of the transformed pes is found it is mapped back to the original surface in the _ hope _ that this will lead to the global minimum on the original pes . however , there is no guarantee that the global minima on the two surfaces are related and often there are good reasons to think that they are not .",
    "for example , one method suggested for clusters is to increase the range of the potential.@xcite such a transformation can dramatically reduce the number of minima@xcite and also lower the barrier heights.@xcite however , it has been shown that changing the range of the potential for clusters can lead to many changes in the identity of the global minimum.@xcite    in contrast , the transformation that we apply to the pes is guaranteed to preserve the identity of the global minimum .",
    "the transformed potential energy @xmath35 is defined by : @xmath36 where @xmath37 represents the vector of nuclear coordinates and min signifies that an energy minimization is performed starting from @xmath37 .",
    "hence the energy at any point in configuration space is assigned to that of the local minimum obtained by the minimization , and the transformed pes consists of a set of plateaus or steps each corresponding to the basin of attraction surrounding a minimum on the original pes .",
    "0.2 cm    one can easily see that the transformation will have a significant effect on the dynamics .",
    "transitions to a lower energy step are barrierless , and so relaxation down a funnel is like descending a multi - dimensional staircase ( figure [ fig : stair ] ) .",
    "furthermore transitions can occur at any point along the boundary between basins of attraction , whereas transitions on the untransformed surface can occur only when the system passes along the transition state valley . as a result intrawell vibrational motion is removed and the system can hop directly between basins of attraction at each simulation step , hence our name for the algorithm , ` basin - hopping ' . in structural terms the system can now pass through large repulsive barriers on the untransformed pes . similarly ,",
    "if the method were applied to a polymer system it should remove entanglement effects because chains can pass through each other .",
    "however , the transformation does not entirely remove the energy barriers between two funnels but only the component due to transition states ( figure [ fig : stair ] ) .",
    "therefore , it is not self - evident that it will aid global optimization on multiple - funnel pes s ; this effect depends on how the transformation affects the thermodynamics of the system .    to explore the transformed pes we simply use a canonical monte carlo simulation . for clusters we also have to consider how to restrict our search of configuration space to that for bound clusters .",
    "this problem is more pressing than for the original pes , since the transformation has removed many of the energy barriers to the dissociation of the cluster .",
    "we have considered two approaches to achieve this .",
    "the first is to place the cluster in a tight - fitting box ; the second is to reset the coordinates at each successful step to the relevant minimum . in the latter case",
    "the method is equivalent to li and scheraga s monte carlo minimization approach,@xcite although they did not conceive of the method in terms of a transformation of the pes .",
    "white and mayne have now shown that resetting the coordinates is probably the best strategy,@xcite and it is the one we concentrate on here .",
    "we have found that the ` basin - hopping ' algorithm performs well . in our application to lennard - jones clusters it found all the known lowest energy configurations up to 110 atoms , including those with non - icosahedral global minima.@xcite furthermore , it has performed impressively for a wide range of cluster systems some of which have a considerably more rugged pes than lennard - jones clusters.@xcite    in figure [ 38gmin.time ] we show some basin - hopping trajectories for and .",
    "it can be seen that the cluster is able to pass between the fcc and icosahedral funnels of over a range of temperature .",
    "therefore , the free energy barriers must be lowered by the transformation . in the next section",
    "we will examine the thermodynamics of the transformed pes to discover the basis for this change .",
    "the predicted acceleration of the dynamics is also evident from the frequency of transitions between the different states of and ( figure [ 38gmin.time ] ) .",
    "the timescale ( in numbers of steps ) for these processes is much more rapid than for similar processes on the original pes , where even diffusion across a flat free energy landscape can be slow .",
    "however , it should be remembered that a single mc step on @xmath35 is much more computationally expensive than an md step or an mc cycle on the untransformed pes , because it involves a minimization .      to calculate the thermodynamics for the transformed energy surface , @xmath35 , the partition of configuration space that we used in section [ sect : thermo.un ] ( equation ( [ equation : supern ] ) )",
    "is appropriate since the plateaus of @xmath35 correspond to the basins of attraction on the original pes .",
    "however , we need to derive the form of @xmath10 . the configurational density of states of a plateau @xmath11 , @xmath38 is simply @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the hyperarea of the basin of attraction of minimum @xmath11 .",
    "this expression is then convoluted with the kinetic density of states to give @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the mass of an atom , @xmath43 is planck s constant , @xmath44 , the number of vibrational degrees of freedom , is @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the heaviside step function .",
    "as @xmath40 can not be readily calculated , we can not use equation ( [ equation : supern ] ) to obtain the total density of states but instead employ equation ( [ equation : superp ] ) .",
    "for @xmath35 the latter approach can even be applied to since , as figure [ 38gmin.time]b shows , conditions can be found where the fcc , icosahedral and liquid - like regions of configurational space are all significantly sampled .",
    "however , since we do our simulations on @xmath35 using standard metropolis monte carlo sampling , we actually use the canonical analogue of equation ( [ equation : superp ] ) : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the partition function , the inverse temperature @xmath49 and the probability distribution was obtained from a basin - hopping trajectory at @xmath50 . to use this equation",
    "we must first laplace transform the expression for @xmath30 in ( 8) to give @xmath51 , the partition function of a plateau : @xmath52 equation ( [ equation : zsuperp ] ) then reduces to @xmath53 it is interesting to note that this equation is identical to that used in histogram mc.@xcite this equivalence stems from the fact that the potential energy is constant on each plateau @xmath11 .",
    "hence the multi - histogram techniques , in which information from a number of runs at different temperatures is used to construct the partition function , could also be applied .",
    "however , such an approach was not necessary in this study .",
    "the @xmath40 values depend upon how configuration space is restricted to bound clusters .",
    "when resetting the coordinates to those of the minimum at each successful step , configuration space is restricted to a hypersphere ( with radius corresponding to the maximum step size ) around each local minimum , and so the thermodynamics ( and the performance of the basin - hopping algorithm@xcite ) is somewhat dependent on the maximum step size used .",
    "when using a container the total accessible configuration space , @xmath54 , is the volume of a @xmath44-dimensional hypersphere whose radius corresponds to that of the container .",
    "therefore , the thermodynamic contribution of irrelevant regions of configuration space corresponding to clusters of low density , or with atoms evaporated , increases with container size .",
    "hence , it is advantageous to use a tight - fitting container , and for this situation the thermodynamics are similar to when the coordinates are reset .    0.1 cm",
    "one further consideration is that one can imagine situations where resetting the coordinates breaks detailed balance . for two minima",
    "a and b which are adjacent on the pes , it may be that no part of the basin of attraction of minimum b is within the maximum step size of minimum a , whereas the basin of attraction of a lies within the maximum step size of minimum b. if so the system can pass from b to a but never from a to b , thus breaking the detailed balance condition .",
    "although this means that the ` resetting ' implementation of the basin - hopping algorithm might not formally produce a canonical ensemble , in practice it does to a good approximation ",
    "the thermodynamic properties calculated using equation ( [ eq : ztrans ] ) for samples generated at different temperatures are in reasonable agreement",
    ".    0.1 cm    for the transformation of the lj@xmath55 pes to reduce the free energy barriers between the funnels , the probability of the system occupying the intermediate states between them must be non - negligible under conditions where the icosahedral and fcc structures also have significant occupation probabilities .",
    "the thermodynamics of the transformed pes have just these properties ( figure [ 38trans.therm]).@xcite the transitions have been smeared out and there is now only one broad peak in the heat capacity .",
    "most significantly , the probability that the system is in the basin of attraction of the global minimum decays much more slowly , and the temperature range for which both the liquid - like minima and the global minimum have significant probabilities is large .",
    "basin - hopping runs anywhere in this temperature range are able to locate the global minimum rapidly from a random starting point . at the lower temperatures in this range , e.g. @xmath56 , there is still a small free energy barrier and so the cluster can be trapped in one of the funnels for many steps ( figure [ 38gmin.time]a ) , however at higher temperatures the system passes more rapidly between the states ( figure [ 38gmin.time]b and c )",
    ".    0.1 cm    in this way we can correlate the performance of the basin - hopping algorithm with the thermodynamics . the temperature dependence of the first - passage time for reaching the global minimum from a random configuration is shown in figure [ 38.fpt ] .",
    "as the temperature decreases the probability of the system being in the high energy intermediate states between the two systems decreases .",
    "the resulting increasing free energy barrier causes the first - passage time to rise at low temperatures .",
    "interestingly , and perhaps unexpectedly , there is little rise at higher temperature . for many systems ,",
    "e.g.  proteins,@xcite the first - passage time has a minimum as a function of temperature ; the rise at high temperature is because the equilibrium probability of being in the global minimum tends to zero .",
    "however , for the basin - hopping algorithm the first - passage time at high temperature is approximately constant.@xcite in fact the probability of being in the global minimum never goes to zero , e.g.  @xmath57 .",
    "the thermodynamics on the transformed surface for are also considerably broadened and the transitions have been smeared out over a large temperature range ( figure [ 55trans.therm ] ) .",
    "consistent with this , there is a greater probability that one of the states intermediate between the global minimum and the liquid is occupied .",
    "as expected for the single funnel topography of , the basin - hopping algorithm needs far fewer steps to find the global minimum than for .",
    "it is remarkable that for a wide range of temperature ( @xmath58 ) the method on average requires fewer than 200 minimizations to find the global minimum from a random starting point ( figure [ 55.fpt ] ) despite the estimated @xmath18 minima on the pes .",
    "this is a testament not just to the efficiency of the basin - hopping algorithm but also to the dramatic effect that a funnel has in guiding the system towards the global minimum . as with the first - passage time",
    "is approximately constant at high temperature ( figure [ 55.fpt ] ) ; @xmath59 .",
    "0.1 cm    the superposition method allows us to connect the thermodynamics to the properties of the pes .",
    "hence we can understand the thermodynamics of the transformed surface by examining expressions for the canonical probability that the system is in a minimum or on a plateau @xmath11 . on the untransformed pes @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the geometric mean vibrational frequency of minimum @xmath11 , and we have used the harmonic approximation ",
    "the more accurate anharmonic form@xcite is complicated and does not provide any additional physical insight . for the transformed pes @xmath62 in equations ( [ eq : ps.un ] ) and ( [ eq : ps.trans ] ) the sums are over _ all _ the minima on the potential energy surface .    0.1 cm    the two expressions ( [ eq : ps.un ] ) and ( [ eq : ps.trans ] ) differ only in the vibrational frequency and @xmath40 terms .",
    "the fcc to icosahedral and the icosahedral to liquid transitions are caused by the greater number of minima ( and therefore the larger entropy ) associated with the higher temperature states . on the untransformed surface this effect is reinforced by the decrease in the mean vibrational frequencies with increasing potential energy ( figure [ 38.vibas]a ) .",
    "although the dependence of @xmath61 on @xmath12 may seem relatively small , because @xmath61 is raised to the power @xmath45 it leads to a significant increase in the entropy of the higher energy states , sharpening the transitions and lowering the temperature at which they occur .",
    "in contrast , @xmath40 decreases rapidly with increasing potential energy , ( figure [ 38.vibas]b ) .",
    "the decrease in @xmath40 reduces the entropy of the higher energy states , causing the transitions to be broadened and the temperature at which they occur to increase .    0.1 cm    to obtain the @xmath40 values shown in figure [ 38.vibas]b we used @xmath63 , the probability with which a plateau @xmath11 was visited in a basin - hopping trajectory . as @xmath64",
    ", relative values of @xmath65 can be found .",
    "a similar inversion of @xmath22 for the untransformed surface allows values of @xmath19 to be found.@xcite however , the @xmath19 and @xmath65 values are for different sets of minima",
    ". the two samples of minima overlap completely for the low energy minima , and so @xmath40 values for these minima can be calculated directly . for higher potential energies , where the spectrum of minima is quasi - continuous ,",
    "we find the average value of @xmath40 in an interval of the potential energy , @xmath66 , from @xmath67 where the sums are only over the minima in the two samples which occur in that energy interval .",
    "the superposition approach also allows us to comment on the thermodynamics of a related optimization algorithm which steps directly between connected minima on the pes ( the steps are achieved using a transition state searching algorithm).@xcite as with the basin - hopping algorithm the detrimental effects of vibrational motion are thus removed .",
    "this method has been successfully used to find low energy structures of amorphous semiconductors@xcite and its performance for a few lennard - jones clusters has also been illustrated.@xcite if each step is accepted with a metropolis criterion then it is easy to formulate the thermodynamics for this discrete space of minima:@xcite @xmath68 this expression is intermediate between equations ( [ eq : ps.un ] ) and ( [ eq : ps.trans ] ) .",
    "the thermodynamics have been broadened with respect to the original pes , but not as much as for the ` basin - hopping ' transformation of the pes .",
    "the above approach is probably less efficient than ` basin - hopping ' because of the expense of searching for a transition state at each step .",
    "however , it has the advantage that interesting information about the pes , such as reaction pathways for complex processes@xcite and the connectivity patterns between the minima,@xcite can also be obtained .",
    "we can now explain in detail why the basin - hopping or monte carlo minimization@xcite method is successful .",
    "first , the staircase transformation removes the transition state barriers between minima on the pes without changing the identity of the global minimum , accelerating the dynamics .",
    "second , it changes the thermodynamics of the surface , broadening the transitions so that even for a multiple - funnel surface such as that of , the global minimum has a significant probability of occupation at temperatures where the free energy barrier for passage between the funnels is surmountable .",
    "it is this latter feature which is especially important in overcoming the difficulties associated with multiple funnels and represents a new criterion for designing successful global optimization methods .",
    "most previous hypersurface deformation schemes have been developed without regard to the thermodynamic effects of the transformation and so , in some cases , they may make optimization more difficult .",
    "the use of tsallis statistics@xcite to improve annealing algorithms is another example of how thermodynamic insight can be used .",
    "the broadened transition also means that the global minimum can be found by simulations over a relatively broad range of temperature .",
    "therefore , simple canonical monte carlo is sufficient to search the transformed surface and the performance is relatively insensitive to the choice of temperature .",
    "however , any of the more advanced techniques for searching pes s such as simulated annealing,@xcite genetic algorithms,@xcite jump walking,@xcite tsallis statistics,@xcite and simulated tempering,@xcite could be used to search the transformed pes . as many of these methods",
    "have been designed to work on untransformed pes s it is not obvious that they will improve performance , and preliminary investigations have not yet indicated that any of them provides a significant advantage .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the most successful applications of genetic algorithms to clusters refine each new configuration generated by mutation or mating by minimization;@xcite this minimization step has been shown to be crucial.@xcite these genetic algorithms are therefore searching the transformed pes , @xmath35 , and it is probably this feature which is responsible for their success .",
    "in fact , we have succeeded in obtaining comparable results for lennard - jones clusters with a modified genetic algorithm.@xcite the most efficient method is likely to be system - dependent and draw upon features from a number of different approaches .    could prove to be an interesting example to explore the use of other techniques to search the transformed surface because its global minimum , even with the basin - hopping algorithm , is difficult to find .",
    "the free energy barriers between the decahedral and fcc funnels , although reduced by the transformation of the pes , are still large enough to make global optimization difficult .",
    "therefore , may provide a suitable system in which to investigate algorithms that enhance barrier crossing or simulate an ensemble which has broader probability distributions than the canonical ensemble .",
    "the broadened transition that results from the staircase transformation also differs markedly from the optimum conditions for protein folding , if we assume that proteins have evolved single - funnel surfaces in order to fold efficiently .",
    "a steep funnel provides a large thermodynamic driving force for relaxation to the global minimum@xcite , and also leads to a sharp thermodynamic transition .",
    "however , in global optimizations one can not make assumptions about the topography of the pes , and on a multiple - funnel pes features such as steepness can exacerbate the difficulties associated with trapping in secondary funnels@xcite .",
    "moreover , in protein folding there is the extra requirement that the folded protein must remain localized in the native state , and this necessitates a sharp transition .",
    "there is no need for a global optimization method to mimic this property . indeed ,",
    "when applied to a pes with multiple funnels the optimum temperature for the basin - hopping approach is above the transition , where the system only spends a minority of its time associated with the global potential energy minimum .",
