    "it is known that cosmological considerations give more stringent constraints on the neutrino mass than the present tritium @xmath1-decay experiments .",
    "for example , @xcite obtained @xmath2ev and @xcite obtained @xmath3ev , using the wmap 1st year data ( wmap1 ) combined with the galaxy power spectrum ( the former used the data from the 2dfgrs and the latter from the sdss main sample .",
    "the difference can be ascribed to the use of the bias information by @xcite ) .",
    "meanwhile , we found @xmath4ev from wmap1 alone as reported in @xcite .",
    "we note that this is the first to point out cmb data ( precisely speaking , wmap1 ) alone can give a sub - ev upper bound on the neutrino mass , which is comparable to the limits obtained from the cmb and galaxy clustering data combined .    before @xcite ( and some time after that too ) , there seems to be a lack of consensus about whether the cmb experiment with the wmap - level precision can derive a sub - ev neutrino mass limit and , in fact , the wmap1 alone limit reported in @xcite , @xmath5ev , which allows 100% hdm was seemingly accepted ( incidentally , the wmap group did not report the wmap1 alone limit on the neutrino mass ) .",
    "we , on the contrary , have derived the upper limit 0.66ev as quoted above from the same data by the @xmath6 minimization method which is independent from the mcmc method adopted by @xcite .",
    "our conclusion is later confirmed by @xcite ( @xcite does not report the wmap1 alone limit in a number but judging from their likelihood figure , it looks less than 1ev . @xcite and @xcite gives @xmath7ev and @xmath0ev respectively ) .",
    "below , we first discuss the wmap alone limit on the neutrino mass comparing results from wmap1 and the wmap 3rd year data ( wmap3 ) .",
    "then , we will investigate its degeneracy with other cosmological parameters , especially the hubble constant .",
    "we here summarize our notations .",
    "we derive neutrino mass constraint in the flat @xmath8cdm model with the power - law adiabatic perturbations .",
    "namely , cosmological parameters we consider are : baryon density @xmath9 , matter density @xmath10 , hubble parameter @xmath11 , reionization optical depth @xmath12 , spectral index of primordial spectrum @xmath13 , its amplitude @xmath14 and massive neutrino density @xmath15 . here , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the energy density normalized to the critical density and @xmath18 where @xmath19 is cdm density ( caution that many literatures define @xmath20 to include the massive neutrino in the matter density ) .",
    "@xmath15 is related to neutrino masses by @xmath21ev ) and we assume three mass degenerate generations of neutrinos so that @xmath22ev ) .",
    "we begin with showing how cmb power spectrum is modified by increasing neutrino mass in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmb_numass ] ( a ) .",
    "the other cosmological parameters are fixed here . in this figure",
    ", we see horizontal shift and suppression around the first peak .",
    "the horizontal shift comes from the fact that the larger @xmath23 ( more non - relativistic particles at present epoch ) implies that the distance to the last scattering surface is shorter and the peaks move to smaller @xmath24 .",
    "however , this shift is easily cancelled by the shift in @xmath11 .",
    "therefore this does not produce a neutrino mass signal .",
    "the suppression of the 1st peak takes place only when @xmath25ev .",
    "this corresponds to 0.3ev in terms of photon temperature @xmath26 .",
    "meanwhile , the recombination takes place at @xmath27 or @xmath28ev . in other words ,",
    "massive neutrinos become non - relativistic before the epoch of recombination if they are heavier than 0.6ev .",
    "therefore , only in this case , the neutrino mass can significantly imprint a characteristic signal in acoustic peaks ( specifically , the matter - radiation equality occurs earlier due to less relativistic degrees of freedom and the enhancement of the 1st peak by the early - integrated sachs - wolfe effect is smaller ) .",
    "this signal , however , could be accidentally mimicked by some combination of other cosmological parameters .",
    "so we searched a large cosmological parameter space in order to find the degree of degeneracy between @xmath23 and the other cosmological parameters .",
    "for each value of @xmath23 , we varied 6 other @xmath8cdm cosmological parameters to find minimum @xmath6 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmb_numass ] ( b ) @xcite .",
    "the wmap1 result @xcite is also shown .",
    "we obtained the upper bound of 0.63ev from wmap3 aloneev . ] and notice that the wmap3 constraint is not improved much from the wmap1 limit .",
    "this is reasonable because the neutrino mass ( larger than 0.6ev ) characteristically modifies the acoustic peaks around 1st and 2nd peaks in the temperature power spectrum and these regions are already well measured by the wmap1 .",
    "we stress that this bound is robust in a sense that it is obtained from cmb data of the wmap which is considered to be the cleanest cosmological data and that it is obtained from a single experiment .",
    "also , cmb can be dealt with the linear perturbation theory so it does not suffer from non - linearity or biasing which appear in galaxy clustering data .",
    "[ fig : on_h ]    so far , we have argued that the hubble constant is degenerate with the neutrino mass in the direction to keep the acoustic peak position constant .",
    "namely , when @xmath23 is larger , @xmath11 should be smaller in order to fit the cmb data .",
    "we show this explicitly in fig .  2 for the case with wmap3 .",
    "note that if @xmath29ev , the best fit @xmath11 is significantly lower than @xmath30 , which is usually considered as the wmap value assuming massless neutrinos .",
    "more interestingly , among the measurements of @xmath11 via the cosmic distance ladder , there is a group @xcite deriving somewhat lower @xmath11 than the famous value of @xcite .",
    "we can expect both ",
    "direct \" measurement of @xmath11 and @xmath23 will improve in near future : @xcite notes that 1% accuracy could be obtained through measuring maser distance to a large number of galaxies in the hubble flow , and @xcite states that @xmath31ev could be determined with 5@xmath32 by katrin experiment .",
    "i would conclude that uncertainty of @xmath23 is one of the largest systematic errors for estimating cosmological parameters from cmb .",
    "we have here shown the effect on @xmath11 but other parameters are affected too ( see fig .  2 in @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the negative correlation between @xmath13 and @xmath23 is notable .",
