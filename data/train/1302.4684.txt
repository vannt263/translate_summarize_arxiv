    "the helium - strong star @xmath0orionise ( hd37479 ; b2vpe ; @xmath4 ) has long been known to possess a circumstellar magnetosphere that is formed by wind plasma that is trapped by a strong dipolar magnetic field ( @xmath510 kg , * ? ? ?",
    "the presence of this magnetosphere can be inferred by the eclipse - like dimmings on its light curve , which is thought to occur when plasma clouds go in front of the star twice every rotation cycle .",
    "this star has been the testbed for important advancements in our theoretical understanding of these magnetospheres .",
    "the rigidly rotating magnetosphere ( rrm ) models of this star were successful in reproducing the observed variability in emission line profiles and photometry @xcite .",
    "polarization is a very useful technique that allows one to probe the geometry of the circumstellar scattering material without angularly resolving it .",
    "@xcite carried out the first polarimetric observations of the @xmath0ori system , but their results where largely inconclusive because of the small values of the intrinsic polarization . in this paper",
    "we present the results of high - precision ( @xmath6% ) polarization monitoring of @xmath0orie , that has resulted in the first firm detection of the polarization modulation produced by a co - rotating magnetosphere .",
    "broad - band linear polarization data were obtained from august , 2010 to september , 2011 , using the iagpol image polarimeter attached to the 0.6-m boller & chivens telescope at pico dos dias observatory ( opd / lna ) .",
    "we used a ccd camera with a polarimetric module described in @xcite , consisting of a rotating half - waveplate and a calcite prism placed in the telescope beam . in each observing run",
    "at least one polarized standard star was observed in order to calibrate the observed position angle . hd23512 and",
    "hd187929 were used as polarized standards .    although typical polarimetric observations consists of 8 consecutive wave plate positions ( hereafter wpp ) separated by 225 @xcite , in this work we chose to use 16 consecutive wpps in order to increase the signal - to - noise ratio . also , to reach the high accuracy needed to monitor the modulation of the polarization , a large number of frames ( typically from 20 to 100 ) were obtained at each wpp . since the exposure times ranged from 0.3 to 1s per frame , the temporal resolution of our observations vary from 7 to 34min , including telescope and instrument overheads .",
    "these values are short enough to temporally resolve the polarimetric variation over the 1.19d period of the star .",
    "details of the data reduction can be found in @xcite .",
    "@xcite report similar values of the polarization for @xmath0oriab , @xmath0ori c and @xmath0ori d , which suggests that all these stars belong to the same physical system , and that the measured polarization is of interstellar ( is ) origin .",
    "we measured the @xmath7 polarization of @xmath0oriab and c and our results are largely consistent with the ones of @xcite .",
    "we used our measured @xmath8-band polarization of @xmath0oriab ( @xmath9% ; 86.7@xmath10 ; @xmath11% ; @xmath12% ) as an estimate of the is polarization towards @xmath0orie .",
    "the @xmath8-band @xmath0orie observations are shown in the left plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : intrinsic ] .",
    "the data was folded in phase ( @xmath13 ) using the ephemerides of @xcite .",
    "shown is the intrinsic polarization , calculated by subtracting the is polarization , estimated using @xmath0oriab , from the observed @xmath14 and @xmath15 stokes parameters .",
    "the polarization has a double - peaked structure , with maxima of about 0.07% occurring at phases around 0.3 and 0.8 and minima occurring around phases 0.1 and 0.6 .",
    "we note that the values reported here are in broad agreement with the data of @xcite , but a more quantitative comparison is hampered by the insufficient accuracy of the latter data .",
    "there is a clear anti - correlation between the photometric and polarimetric variations , with the polarization minima roughly coinciding with the photometric maxima and vice - versa , but there are important differences between the two curves .",
    "one such difference lies in their symmetry : the photometry is clearly asymmetric , with the secondary minimum occurring at about phase 0.4 ( the primary minimum occurs at @xmath16 by definition ) , and the behavior of the two inter - minima being very different from each other .",
    "the polarization curve , however , seems to be roughly symmetric with respect to @xmath17 . that the asymmetry is seen in the photometry , but not in the polarization , is further supporting evidence that  as hypothesized in @xcite  the asymmetric light curve arises due to contamination of the circumstellar signal by a photospheric signal .",
    "that is , the photometric variations come from a combination of magnetospheric eclipses and photospheric abundance inhomogeneities , and therefore lack rotational symmetry ; but conversely , because the polarization variations come solely from magnetospheric electron scattering , we do see rotational symmetry in their case .    in order to determine the location of the polarization minimum , we fitted the data between @xmath18 and 0.75 with a parabola , using the levenberg - marquardt algorithm @xcite .",
    "we find that the minimum of the intrinsic polarization occurs at @xmath19 . to determine the location of the maximum , the same procedure was applied to the data between @xmath20 and 1 .",
    "according to this fit the maximum of the polarization occurs at @xmath21 . to further assess the symmetry of the data we fitted the polarization data with the following function @xmath22\\ , , \\label{eq : sin}\\ ] ] which implicitly assumes a period of half of the orbital period for the polarimetric data .",
    "the result of the fit gives @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , with a reduced @xmath26 .",
    "the fitted function is displayed as the black line in the middle plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : intrinsic ] .",
    "the data seems to be well represented by eq .",
    "( [ eq : sin ] ) , which indicates that , contrary to the photometry , the polarization curve is roughly symmetric . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : sin ] ) , the position of the minima are @xmath27 and 0.58 , and the maxima are at @xmath28 and 0.83 .",
    "those values are in good agreement with the phases derived above via a parabola fitting .",
    "the minimum and maximum values of the polarization are , respectively , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "an important feature of the intrinsic polarization of @xmath0orie is that it is never zero .",
    "this indicates that there is some degree of asymmetry of the scattering material ( as seen projected onto the plane of the sky ) throughout the entire rotation period .",
    "the data shown in the left plot of fig .  [ fig : intrinsic ] are in the equatorial frame .",
    "the weighted - average of all the data gives a value of @xmath31 and @xmath32 , which , in turn , results in an average position angle of @xmath33 .",
    "this value tells us the ( average ) direction of the minor axis of the asymmetric structure .",
    "furthermore , the small variation of the position angle ( fig .  [ fig : intrinsic ] , left ) tells us that the direction of the minimum elongation axis changes little ( @xmath34@xmath35 , at most ) as the star rotates .",
    "this last point is better understood if we rotate the intrinsic polarization by @xmath36 so that the average value of @xmath15 is zero ( fig .",
    "[ fig : intrinsic ] , right plot ) . in this new frame",
    ", we see that the amplitude of the rotational modulation of @xmath15 is small .",
    "if we assume that the symmetry axis is parallel to the rotation axis , we conclude that the projected axis of symmetry of the magnetosphere varies little as the star rotates .",
    "as discussed below , this has quite important consequences for the rrm model .",
    "another noteworthy feature of the polarization curve is that there is a phase shift of @xmath2 between the primary minimum of the lightcurve and the polarization minimum .",
    "the rrm model of @xcite predicts the existence of two plasma clouds co - rotating with the star .",
    "if the clouds were symmetrical and the photospheric flux were homogeneous , there should be no phase difference between the polarization and photometric curves ; the observed phase shift , therefore , is likely a result of cloud asymmetries and photospheric abundance inhomogeneities .",
    "orie using the rrm model ( observations are in red ) .",
    "the only free parameter is the maximum number density in the magnetosphere , which was set to @xmath37 ( solid lines ) to reproduce the depth of the eclipses and @xmath38 ( dotted lines ) to reproduce the amplitude of the linear polarization .",
    "[ fig : rrm_fit ] ]",
    "@xcite applied the rrm model to @xmath0orie with good success .",
    "this model predicts the accumulation of circumstellar plasma in two co - rotating clouds , situated in magnetohydrostatic equilibrium at the intersections between the magnetic and rotational equators .",
    "comparison with the available data ( photometry and h@xmath39 line profiles ) showed that the model provided a good quantitative description of the circumstellar environment .    in an attempt to reproduce the observed polarization modulation of @xmath0orie , we fed the predicted density distribution of the rrm model of @xcite to the hdust radiative transfer code @xcite .",
    "since all stellar and geometrical parameters were taken from @xcite , the only free parameter in the model is the density scale of the magnetosphere .",
    "the results of this modeling are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rrm_fit ] . we could not find a model that matched simultaneously both the photometry and the polarimetry . a higher density model ( solid line ) that matches the depth of the photometric eclipses",
    "predicts a polarization amplitude that is three times larger than what is observed .",
    "conversely , a lower density model that reproduces the amplitude of the polarization fails to reproduce the photometric amplitude .",
    "furthermore , the detailed shape of the polarization curve , in particular the position angle variation , is not well matched .",
    "since the polarization postion angle is sensitive to the geometry of the scattering material , this discrepancy indicates that the primary difficulty with the basic rmm model is the shape of its density distribution .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]   , title=\"fig : \" ]   , title=\"fig : \" ]   , title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "we now explore what changes must be made to the basic rrm model to better reproduce the shape of the polarimetric variability .",
    "the rrm predicts the existence of diametrally opposed plasma clouds confined in the rotational equator and a diffuse plasma disk close to the magnetic equator .",
    "based on this idea , we developed a simple toy model for @xmath0orie that consists of two elements : 1 ) a thin uniform disk tilted by an angle @xmath40 from the rotational equator , and 2 ) a pair of spherical blobs situated in the equatorial plane at the intersection between this plane and the magnetic equator , thus forming a `` dumbbell - like '' structure .",
    "this configuration is illustrated in fig  [ fig : model ] , for several orbital phases and for a viewing angle of @xmath41 .    since the polarization is small",
    ", we may perform the calculation of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 stokes parameters as a function of orbital phase for a given inclination angle @xmath42 following a simple single - scattering approach ( valid only in the optically thin limit ) .",
    "the scattered flux is first determined in the frame of the star using the formalism described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . 6 ) and then rotated to the frame of the observer ( * ? ? ?",
    "20 ) .    for this initial study",
    ", we adopted 5 fixed parameters , listed in table  [ tab : mod ] , whose values were based on the models of @xcite .",
    "they are the stellar radius , @xmath43 , the distance of the blobs from the star , @xmath44 , the size of the blobs , @xmath45 , the geometrical thickness of the disk , @xmath46 , and the inclination angle , @xmath42 .",
    "the adopted value for @xmath47 is somewhat arbitrary , since in the limit of @xmath48 and in the single - scattering approximation , a large , tenuous blob is roughly equivalent to a dense , small blob .",
    "for the same reason , the disk geometrical thickness is also somewhat arbitrary : if the single - scattering approximation holds , a thinner , denser disk is equivalent to a thicker , less dense disk . in other words ,",
    "what really controls the polarization level of each component is their total scattering mass . for the inclination angle",
    "we adopt two possible values : @xmath49 , corresponding to a projected counterclockwise rotation of the blobs on the sky and @xmath50 , corresponding to a clockwise rotation .    in this analysis we made _",
    "no previous assumptions about the is polarization _ ; i.e. , we fitted directly the observed @xmath14 and @xmath15 stokes parameters .",
    "the adopted modeling procedure is as follows :",
    "1 .   choose values for electron number density in the blob and disk ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) , the phase lag , @xmath53 , between the photometric primary minimum ( @xmath16 ) and the orbital phase where the blobs are aligned with the line of sight , the tilt angle of the disk , @xmath40 , and the position angle of the equatorial plane in the plane of the sky , @xmath54 .",
    "these 5 parameters define a unique model for the intrinsic @xmath14 and @xmath15 in the equatorial frame",
    "choose values for @xmath55 and @xmath56 and use them to calculate synthetic observed @xmath14 and @xmath15 parameters .",
    "calculate the reduced @xmath57 of the model .",
    "repeat steps 1 and 3 for several hundred of values for the 7 free parameters and choose the model with minimum @xmath57",
    ".    the parameters of our best - fitting model ( reduced @xmath58 ) are listed in table  [ tab : mod ] .",
    "the estimated errors are for a 95% confidence interval .",
    "a notable result is that the is polarization , independently obtained by this analysis , is consistent ( within the errors ) with the estimate made using @xmath0oriab as a measure of the is .",
    "both the orientation of the equatorial plane in the sky ( @xmath54 ) and the phase lag ( @xmath53 ) are consistent with the estimate made in sect .",
    "[ results_aca ] .",
    "the resulting blob density corresponds to an electron optical depth of @xmath59 , which does not violate the optically thin assumption .",
    "it is worth mentioning that our estimate for the electron density in the blobs , @xmath60@xmath61 , is in good agreement with the values derived by and using the inglis - teller formula . from the best - fitting parameters",
    "one can calculate the mass of each model component . assuming a molecular weight of 0.6 , which corresponds to a fully ionized gas with solar chemical composition , the mass of each blob is @xmath62 and the mass of the disk is @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , we obtain that both components have similar masses ( @xmath3 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : intrinsic ] , right plot , we show the observations corrected by the is polarization of table  [ tab : mod ] .",
    "the solid curves correspond to the best - fitting single scattering model .",
    "the two minima of the model polarization occur at the phases for which the two blobs are alined with the line of sight . at these phases ,",
    "the model @xmath14 parameter is minimum and the @xmath15 parameter is maximum ( negative for @xmath64 and positive for @xmath65 ) , because the disk dominates the polarized flux at these phases .",
    "conversely , the polarized flux is dominated by the blobs at the phases at which the blobs are on the side of the star ( @xmath66 and positive for @xmath67 ) .",
    "an interesting result is that the data allowed us to firmly establish that the blobs are rotating counterclockwise on the plane of the sky . in the right plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : intrinsic ] , the solid curves show the best - fitting model for @xmath68 ( reduced @xmath58 ) while the dotted curves correspond to the best fitting model with @xmath69 ( reduced @xmath70 ) .",
    "the former is clearly a much better fit to the data .    an alternate comparison between the data and the single - scattering model is made in fig .  [ fig : qu ] , where we plot the observed ( i.e. , uncorrected for is polarization ) @xmath15 vs. @xmath14 parameters .",
    "the blue points correspond to the phase range @xmath53@xmath71 , the orange ones from @xmath71@xmath72 , the green ones from @xmath72@xmath73 and the red ones from @xmath73@xmath53 . in the @xmath74 plane",
    "the behavior of the data is quite different from the first half - cycle to the second : while in the first half ( blue and orange points ) the data forms a nearly - circular outer loop , in the second half ( green and red points ) there is an inward incursion .",
    "the model reproduces this behavior .",
    "it is important to point out that the two - component model ( blob+disk ) adopted by us is required to produce such a behavior in the @xmath74 plane .",
    "for instance , a model with only the blobs would form a symmetric double ellipse in the @xmath74 plane , while a model with only the tilted disk would result in a shape resembling a crescent moon .",
    "the observed curve , composed of an outer loop and an inner incursion , can only be obtained by a combination of these two components .",

    "the polarimetric data presented here for @xmath0orie has an accuracy of at least one order magnitude better than those shown in the work of @xcite and thus represent the first firm detection of the polarization modulation of a co - rotating magnetosphere .",
    "the intrinsic polarization , calculated using @xmath0oriab as a measure of the is polarization , displays a roughly symmetric sinusoidal curve ranging from 0.02 to 0.08% , with a period of half of the orbital period and a phase lag of -0.085 between the polarization minimum and the primary minimum of the light curve .",
    "the polarization position angle is also variable .",
    "its mean value of @xmath1 indicates that the minor elongation axis of the asymmetric structure around @xmath0orie is oriented @xmath1 east of the celestial north .",
    "a preliminary analysis made with the rrm model @xcite suggests that it is difficult to fit both the photometry and the polarization simultaneously .",
    "this seems to imply that the geometry of the plasma clouds , as predicted by the current version of the model , is incorrect .",
    "however , the data was well reproduced by a two - component model , consisting of two spherical , diametrally opposed blobs and a disk tilted with respect to the rotational equator .",
    "this model was physically motivated by the rrm model , which predicts accumulation of centrifugally supported wind plasma in a disk - like structure with the highest densities ( corresponding to the blobs ) at the points where the magnetic equator intersects the rotational equator .",
    "this model provided useful constraints on the total scattering mass of each component . also , it provided an independent estimate for the is polarization , as well as for the orientation of the equatorial direction in the plane of the sky .",
    "our best - fitting model suggests that the mass of each blob is @xmath90 and the mass of the disk is @xmath63 , which indicates that both components have similar masses ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "also , the tilt angle of the disk with respect to the plane of the sky is @xmath91 , similar to the angle between the rotational and magnetic axes @xcite . finally , the model allowed us to determine that the blobs are rotating counterclockwise on the plane of the sky .",
