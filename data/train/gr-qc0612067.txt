    "models of compact `` stars '' described by non - fluid sources serve both as probes of strong field gravity as well as exotic alternatives to the standard `` regular '' fluid stars . among these non - standard star models ,",
    "a geon a self gravitating star consisting of electromagnetic fields was first considered by wheeler  @xcite . despite its appeal ,",
    "no stable geon could be constructed and so interest diminished . however , borrowing from this idea , kaup was able to construct the first stable configuration referred to as a _ klein - gordon geon_ by considering a @xmath0 classical scalar field  @xcite . soon after kaup s construction , ruffini and bonazzola revisited the solution , adopting a quantum point of view for the matter fields though maintaining the geometry as a classical entity  @xcite . by employing a hartree - fock ( multi - particle ) approximation ,",
    "they re - obtain kaup s equations ( and hence solutions ) providing an alternative view to the resulting stars .",
    "these solutions are currently known as _ boson stars _ and describe a family of self - gravitating scalar field configurations within general relativity .",
    "boson stars have been studied in many different contexts ( see @xcite,@xcite for reviews ) .",
    "they have been proposed as models for dark matter ( see @xcite for a recent review ) and more recently have been used as convenient models for compact objects including black holes @xcite .",
    "one can consider strongly gravitating compact - star spacetimes without the worries associated with regular matter such as shock fronts and discontinuities in the fluid variables making boson stars very useful probes of strong - field general relativity",
    ".    given this utility , a number of efforts have modeled the dynamical evolution of boson stars .",
    "for instance , they have been considered in one and two dimensions for studies of critical phenomena  @xcite . in three dimensions , studies of the dynamics of perturbed boson stars",
    "have been presented in @xcite and preliminary collisions in @xcite .",
    "works examining boson star collisions in two dimensions were carried out in @xcite while in three dimensions , in addition to our own , another effort is under way  @xcite .",
    "another work which studies the collisions of q - balls also has relevance here  @xcite .",
    "these q - balls are solitonic solutions of the klein - gordon equations in the absence of gravity with an attractive potential .    in this paper",
    "we investigate several boson star configurations paying particular attention to head - on collisions in 3d .",
    "our aim is to survey some of the phenomenology that can be found in these scenarios .",
    "additionally , since one can employ this particular physical system to describe strongly gravitating compact stars , one can use them to model compact systems in general relativity in their early stages where tidal effects are not too severe . on a more speculative level , one can also examine the gravitational wave signature produced so that searches by gravitational wave detectors might place constraints on their existence .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ equations ]",
    "we detail the formalism we use for the einstein - klein - gordon system .",
    "section [ numerics ] describes the numerical implementation of the governing equations . in section",
    "iv we present our results .",
    "we conclude in section  [ conclusions ] adding some final comments .",
    "the computation of the initial data for a single boson star is described in the appendix  [ initial_data ] , while the appendix  [ energy_considerations ] is devoted to some ( qualitative ) physical considerations in order to explain the results of the simulations .",
    "the dynamics of a complex scalar field in a curved spacetime is described by the following lagrangian density ( adopting geometrical units , i.e. @xmath1 ) @xcite @xmath2\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath3 is the ricci scalar , @xmath4 is the spacetime metric , @xmath5 is the scalar field , @xmath6 its complex conjugate , and @xmath7 a potential depending only on @xmath8 . throughout this paper roman letters at the beginning of the alphabet @xmath9",
    "denote spacetime indices ranging from 0 to 3 , while letters near the middle @xmath10 range from 1 to 3 , denoting spatial indices .",
    "this lagrangian gives rise to the equations determining the evolution of the metric ( einstein equations ) and those governing the scalar field behavior ( klein - gordon equations ) .",
    "the variation of the action associated with the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) with respect to the metric @xmath4 leads to the einstein equations @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the ricci tensor and @xmath13 is the stress - energy tensor given by @xmath14     \\nonumber \\\\      & - & \\frac{1}{2 } g_{ab } \\left[g^{cd}\\partial_c \\bar \\phi   \\partial_d \\phi          + v\\left(|\\phi|^2\\right)\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the einstein equations form a system of @xmath15 non - linear partial differential equations for the spacetime metric components @xmath4 . a convenient way to express the equations",
    "can be obtained by the identity @xmath16 where we have introduced the quantities @xmath17    to this point we have considered arbitrary coordinates @xmath18 that label spacetime points . in order to define an initial value problem for the einstein equations ,",
    "a foliation defined by the hypersurfaces with @xmath19 is introduced with normalized normal vector @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the covariant derivative associated to @xmath4 .",
    "the harmonic formulation of einstein equations exploits the fact that the coordinates @xmath18 can be chosen satisfying the harmonic @xmath22  @xcite or their generalized version  @xcite @xmath23 where the functions @xmath24 amount to prescribing coordinate conditions .",
    "these expressions can be combined to re - express einstein equations ( [ ee1 ] ) in their generalized harmonic form , as  @xcite @xmath25\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that the partial derivatives of @xmath24 do not belong to the principal part of the system since they are prescribed spacetime functions .",
    "the principal part of ( [ dedonder1 ] ) is a well posed system of decoupled wave equations for the 10 metric components .",
    "it is important to stress that equations ( [ dedonder1 ] ) with the generalized harmonic condition ( [ harmonic1 ] ) constitute an overdetermined system since @xmath26 can be obtained either from the choice of coordinates ( [ harmonic1 ] ) or from the evolution of the metric itself ( [ dedonder1 ] ) . in the free - evolution approach , equation ( [ dedonder1 ] )",
    "is adopted to update the metric , and equation ( [ harmonic1 ] ) is regarded as a constraint on the full system .",
    "possible constraint violations can be measured by introducing a new four - vector   difference between the formulation presented here and @xcite .",
    "this is for convenience as unnecessary factors of @xmath27 are hence removed ] @xmath28 clearly , the physical solutions will be those satisfying the algebraic condition @xmath29 throughout the spacetime ; we will refer to the @xmath30 quantities as the z - constraints from now on .",
    "note that added flexibility , useful for numerical purposes , is attained by adding these constraints to the equations .",
    "in particular , since the addition of these z - constraints to the evolution system can change the stability of the solutions against perturbations off the constraint surface one can exploit this fact to one s advantage . indeed , suitable terms can be added to the equations in order to construct an attractor for the physical solutions in certain spacetimes , in such a way that small z - constraint violations will be damped during the evolution @xcite . with these damping terms , equation ( [ dedonder1 ] ) can be written as @xmath31 \\nonumber \\\\   & & - 2~\\sigma_0~\\left[n_a z_b + n_b z_a - g_{a b } n^c z_c \\right ]   - 16~\\pi~\\left ( t_{ab } - \\frac{t}{2}~g_{ab}\\right ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have introduced @xmath32 , which is a free parameter that controls the damping of the z - constraints ( [ harmonicz ] ) .      as mentioned , the variation of the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) with respect to the scalar field @xmath5 leads to the klein - gordon ( kg ) equations @xmath33 where the box @xmath34 stands here for the wave operator on a curved background .",
    "for concreteness , from now on we will consider the free field case where the potential takes the form @xmath35 with @xmath36 a parameter that can be identified with the bare mass of the field theory , although it has units of inverse length . for our simulations",
    "we have fixed its value to unity .",
    "the potential ( [ potential ] ) leads to the so - called _ miniboson stars _ , because achievable stable configurations have small masses .",
    "more general terms can be included , such as the @xmath37 self - interaction term introduced in @xcite , leading to heavier _ boson stars _ which have masses and sizes more relevant to astrophysical applications when considering their compactification ratio . in the present work we restrict to the @xmath38 case , deferring to a future work the study of the effect of this self - interacting term .",
    "the second order einstein - klein - gordon ( ekg ) equations ( [ dedonder2])-([kg1 ] ) , can be employed to obtain the future evolution of the spacetime if @xmath39 are provided at an initial hypersurface . for a numerical implementation ,",
    "it is also useful to further reduce the system to fully first order to take advantage of several numerical techniques devised to exploit stability theorems for these kind of systems  @xcite .",
    "consequently , these techniques provide a clean path to discretize the system in a robust manner  @xcite .",
    "thus we begin by reducing these equations to first order form .    the reduction in time",
    "is achieved by introducing new independent variables related to the time derivatives of the fields . following a similar route as in @xcite , we define @xmath40 the evolution equations for @xmath41 and @xmath42 are now given by the ekg equations ( [ dedonder2],[kg1 ] ) , while the evolution equations for @xmath4 and @xmath5 are simply given by their definition ( [ time1 ] ) .    the reduction to first order in space",
    "is made by introducing new independent variables encoding the first space derivatives as @xmath43 the equations of motion for these quantities are obtained by applying the time derivative to their definition ( [ space1 ] ) and imposing that time and spatial derivatives commute .",
    "notice that in this step , just as with the z - constraints , one encounters an overdetermined system since spatial derivatives can be obtained either by deriving the fields or from the evolution equation of the new quantities ( [ space1 ] ) .",
    "this fact can be re - interpreted as adding new constraints to the system @xmath44 which must be satisfied for a consistent solution .",
    "an analogous situation is encountered with the conditions @xmath45 resulting from the commutativity of the second spatial derivatives .",
    "henceforth we will refer to the @xmath46 quantities as the c - constraints . at this point",
    "the resulting first order system is described by the evolution equations for the array of fields @xmath47 together with the z - constraints ( [ harmonicz ] ) and c - constraints ( [ constraint1],[constraint2 ] ) .",
    "additionally , as with the z - constraints , the mathematical properties of the evolution system can be changed when the constraints are not exactly satisfied by judiciously adding the c - constraints to the right - hand - side of the equations .",
    "for instance , in @xcite these constraints are incorporated in the equations in such a way that the physical solutions ( i.e. , those satisfying @xmath48 ) are an attractor in certain spacetimes .",
    "this means that small c - constraint violations will also be damped during the evolution .",
    "we follow the same approach here for the full first order reduction of the einstein klein - gordon equations by writing them as : @xmath49   \\nonumber   \\\\",

    "additionally , we have introduced the familiar lapse @xmath51 and shift @xmath52 functions for convenience .",
    "these are defined through the relations @xmath53 ( @xmath54 being the spatial projection of @xmath4 satisfying @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) and @xmath57 . equations ( [ ekg1order]-[lasteqn_ekg1order ] ) constitute the final set of equations being integrated in our implementation . +      one way to identify the position of the boson star , which in the fully dynamical might prove difficult , is to use the energy density @xmath58 .",
    "we have used the maximum of @xmath59 , at each temporal slice to represent the center of each star - like configuration .",
    "another useful quantity , which is of special interest in the case of the boson - antiboson collision , is the noether charge of the theory . due to the u(1 )",
    "symmetry of the stress - energy tensor , there is a conserved quantity which can be computed by @xmath60.\\ ] ] we employ the noether density @xmath61 to give additional evidence as to the location of the boson star . as discussed in  @xcite ,",
    "this quantity can be associated with the number of bosonic particles .",
    "the mass of the stars is computed by means of the adm mass , which is defined as : @xmath62~{\\cal n}^k~ds\\ ] ] where @xmath63 stands here for the unit outward normal to the sphere .",
    "the gravitational radiation is described asymptotically when the correct tetrad and coordinates are adopted , by the newman - penrose ( spin - weighted ) @xmath64 scalar .",
    "this quantity is defined as @xmath65 with @xmath66 being the weyl tensor and where @xmath67 denotes the incoming null normal to the extraction worldtube @xmath68 while @xmath69 is the complex conjugate of the null vector tangent to @xmath68 at a constant time slice .    to analyze the structure of the radiated waveforms",
    "it is convenient to decompose the signal in @xmath70 spin weighted spherical harmonics as , @xmath71 where the factor @xmath72 is included to better capture the @xmath73 leading order behavior of @xmath64 . for head - on collisions of non - spinning objects",
    ", one could take advantage of the natural axis of symmetry defined by the line joining the centers of the objects .",
    "in such a case , the ( spin weighted ) spherical harmonics @xmath74 can be defined such that the radiation produced in the axisymmetric configuration would display essentially only @xmath75 modes . however , as we are interested in more general cases also , we adopt spherical harmonics defined with respect to an axis that can be regarded as orthogonal with respect to the orbital plane , which in our present case is given by the @xmath76 axis . in this case , the radiation extracted would have non - trivial components for @xmath77 .",
    "we also focus in integral quantities that are independent of the specific basis of the spherical harmonics , such as the radiated energy . in terms of @xmath64 , we can write @xmath78~ d{\\omega } ~,\\ ] ] where @xmath79 denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath64 , and @xmath80 is the extraction radius .",
    "using both the decomposition ( [ rpsi4 ] ) and the orthonormalization of the spherical harmonics , this expression can also be written as @xmath81 finally , we notice that we will assume the resulting coordinates in the neighborhood of the extraction surfaces satisfy , to a reasonable level , conditions ensuring @xmath64 is essentially free of spurious effects ( aside from those arising from the extraction at finite distances )  @xcite . detailed studies of the possible influences of these in more general settings will be presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the first order symmetric hyperbolic system ( [ ekg1order]-[lasteqn_ekg1order ] ) is implemented following techniques devised to take advantage of several useful theorems which guarantee the stable implementation of linear hyperbolic systems . in general these techniques",
    "involve : ( i ) discrete derivative operators satisfying summation by parts ( sbp ) , which allow defining a semidiscrete norm and an energy estimate for the solution @xcite , ( ii ) a method of lines employing a third order runge - kutta operator for the time integration that preserves the energy estimate in the fully discrete case @xcite , and ( iii ) maximally dissipative boundary conditions that keep this energy bounded in time @xcite in presence of boundaries .",
    "the combination of techniques ( i - iii ) guarantee that linear problems are implemented stably and thus provides a direct route to a robust implementation of generic first order hyperbolic systems .",
    "additionally , we introduce a kreiss - oliger type dissipative operator ( suitably modified at / near boundary points so as not to spoil the energy estimate @xcite ) .",
    "the introduction of dissipation allows one to control the high frequency modes of the solution which are always poorly described by a finite difference approach . in what follows",
    "we provide further details of the particular application of these techniques in the present work .",
    "we have adopted second order derivative operators satisfying sbp and defined a discrete energy essentially as the @xmath82 norm of the solution , that is @xmath83 where @xmath84 is an array with all the evolved variables and @xmath85 is the value of @xmath86 at the grid point @xmath87 .",
    "the energy estimate is obtained when the discrete operators reduce to the standard three - point centered derivative operator at interior points while the standard ( first order ) two - point sideways stencil at boundary points .",
    "the particular form for the kreiss - oliger fourth order dissipation operator is described in @xcite as is the third order runge - kutta scheme employed to advance the solution in time .",
    "we additionally employ the norm of the z - constraints , @xmath88 to monitor the deviation of the numerical solution from the physical one .",
    "as mentioned , we employ maximally dissipative boundary conditions .",
    "these conditions rely on knowing the characteristic mode structure of the principal part of the system .",
    "in essence , these conditions bound the amount of `` energy '' the incoming modes introduce at the boundaries to remain below what the outgoing modes carry away from the computational domain .",
    "schematically , this reduces to adopting conditions satisfying @xmath89 with @xmath90 denoting incoming / outgoing modes at a given boundary , and @xmath91 a bounded matrix @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the norm  ( [ energy ] ) of the solution remains bounded in the linear regime , which is key to ensure the well posednes of the ibvp ( for details see @xcite ) . in our particular case , we choose @xmath92 thus setting the incoming modes to zero .",
    "the characteristic decomposition ( eigenmodes @xmath93 with velocity @xmath94 ) for the ekg system ( [ ekg1order]-[lasteqn_ekg1order ] ) is given by @xmath95 with @xmath63 the outgoing normal vector to the boundary surface and the supra - indices @xmath96 denote modes propagating with the different speeds @xmath97 .",
    "thus the incoming modes are given by @xmath98 and @xmath99 as long as @xmath100 .",
    "to apply the maximally dissipative conditions at the numerical level , we follow the prescription described in @xcite and simply enforce @xmath101      adaptive mesh refinement  ( amr ) provides increased resolution where and when needed , and therefore becomes an essential tool in resolving a wide range of dynamical scales , both spatial and temporal .",
    "as described by berger and oliger  @xcite , a given numerical grid can be further refined based on dynamical measures of the numerical error by the creation of refined grids which are evolved in sync with the coarse grid .",
    "we have built our code taking advantage of the computational infrastructure called had ( an outgrowth of the code presented in @xcite ) .",
    "had implements a ( slight ) modification of the standard berger - oliger strategy that guarantees preserving the stability properties of the unigrid implementation and significantly reduces spurious reflections at interface boundaries  @xcite . in",
    "had creation or destruction of finer grids is automated so that points which display an error above some threshold are `` covered '' by a finer grid .",
    "the error associated with each point is computed via a self - shadow hierarchy  @xcite . in this technique ,",
    "the error is computed on any given grid by subtracting the solution on that grid with that on the next coarser level . because these solutions evolve with different resolutions , their difference represents a measure of the local truncation error without recourse to more complicated shadow schemes . in particular , at any given point , the @xmath82 norm of the difference between the solutions over all evolved fields is taken as the truncation error estimate .",
    "although we have performed binary boson star runs employing amr , in this work we take only partial advantage of the mesh refinement capabilities of had .",
    "one reason for this is that we want to compare significantly different scenarios and we find it useful to ensure similar discretizations are employed across the cases considered .",
    "our procedure is to let the infrastructure define the grid structures at the initial time and keep it fixed throughout the simulations .",
    "the truncation error value employed by the self - shadow hierarchy to define the grids is chosen such that the original stars are contained within the finest grid and that this grid covers the whole region in between . fixing the grid structure at the initial time",
    "reduces some of the overhead and memory required by dynamic regridding .",
    "in this section we describe the simulations we have performed both to check the correctness of the implementation and investigate interesting aspects of boson star head - on collisions .",
    "we begin in  [ single_boson ] , by considering a single isolated boson star configuration and verify the code is able to reproduce known features of the solution .",
    "the evolution of the star is performed employing two different coordinate systems , a static one and the harmonic one .",
    "the former coordinate system is the natural one employed in constructing a single static boson star solution , and so the evolution with it should be trivial .",
    "the latter one does not conform to the ansatz employed to obtain the solution and some non - trivial dynamics can be expected .    in section  [ headon ]",
    "we consider different binary systems described by boson stars with zero initial momentum .",
    "initial data for these systems is obtained by a simple superposition of a single boson star with another which is identical to it up to a possible phase or reflection of its natural frequency .",
    "the stars are placed sufficiently far from each other to ensure the constraints are satisfied to a degree consistent with the value obtained in the single boson star case .",
    "we have performed three different types of head - on collisions : collisions of equal boson stars  [ equal_mass_merger ] , collisions of boson stars whose phase are in opposition  [ unequal_phase_merger ] and finally collisions of boson stars with antiboson stars  [ boson_antiboson ] ( these differences are explained in detail below ) .",
    "for all of the simulations presented here we have adopted damping parameters @xmath102 , a courant factor @xmath103 and kreiss - oliger dissipation parameterized by @xmath104 ( as described in  @xcite ) .",
    "the simulations have been performed on 64 to 128 processors employing 3 refinement levels , placed as defined by the shadow hierarchy .",
    "as described in the introduction , a boson star is a self gravitating configuration of scalar field with lagrangian given by  ( [ lagrangian ] ) . in a particular coordinate system",
    ", one assumes a particular form for the spherically symmetric scalar field @xmath105 therefore the field values at any given point oscillate with a constant frequency @xmath106 .",
    "details of the calculation of @xmath107 are presented in appendix  [ initial_data ] .",
    "the geometry , on the other hand , remains static in these same coordinates .",
    "the resulting spacetime provides a reasonable model for that resulting from a compact object in equilibrium .",
    "we have carried out simulations of single boson stars under two coordinate choices . in  [ static_evolution ]",
    "we summarize the results in the coordinate system on which the solution is static and the results in the harmonic gauge is presented in  [ harmonic_coords ] .",
    "the simulations presented for both cases employ a grid structure consisting of three levels of refinement .",
    "the finest level covers the radius @xmath108 of the star ( defined as region of space containing approximately 95% of the star s mass ) and the other boxes surrounding it with half the resolution each respectively .",
    "for all these runs the star is located at @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) and the computational domain is given by @xmath111 $ ] .    to obtain a measure of the convergence rate of the solution",
    ", we have performed simulations with different resolutions for the boxes .",
    "the finest grid of each resolution considered has @xmath112 for the static coordinates and @xmath113 for the harmonic ones .",
    "the others grids , as mentioned , have a gradual 2:1 ratio in their discretization length .    below we detail certain convergence tests of the code about which we would like to make a general comment",
    ". residuals of constraints are expected to approach zero with increases in resolution while field variables should approach a unique solution , and this behavior is indeed what we find .",
    "the rate of convergence can also be examined and compared to the expected approximation order of the difference equations solved , and we found the expected second order convergence in the unigrid case .",
    "however when dealing with a complicated grid hierarchy , precise measurements of this rate become somewhat problematic , especially when the hierarchies produced vary with the truncation error threshold chosen .",
    "also , we should mention that more detailed convergence tests with this code infrastructure applied to other problems demonstrate the expected order of convergence  @xcite .      in order to maintain the coordinates such that the spacetime remains static",
    "the @xmath114 functions in  ( [ harmonic1 ] ) need to been chosen in a suitable way .",
    "since we are considering a static situation , the condition on @xmath24 can be read directly from the equation ( [ harmonicz ] ) by imposing the constraints ( i.e. , @xmath115 ) and the staticity of the spacetime ( i.e. , @xmath116 ) . in a explicitly static scenario ,",
    "this initial value of the @xmath117 is preserved for all times .",
    "we begin with an initial data describing a star where the value of the scalar field defining it at the origin is @xmath118 .",
    "this star , which is obtained by solving the initial data problem with a high resolution one - dimensional code as described in the appendix  [ initial_data ] , has an adm mass of @xmath119 and radius @xmath120 , and lies well inside the stable branch of solutions .",
    "the evolution of an isolated star displays the expected behavior .",
    "in particular , the geometry is static and the behavior of the scalar field agrees with eq .",
    "( [ oscillatory_ansatz ] ) as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ sphi ] where the central value of the real part of the scalar field versus time describes an oscillatory behavior with a frequency @xmath121 .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the frequency obtained with the one - dimensional initial - data problem code @xmath122 .      in this section",
    "we revisit the initial data of the previous one , but in this case we do not adopt coordinate conditions that explicitly demonstrate the staticity of the spacetime .",
    "one goal of this exercise is to test the ability of the harmonic - coordinate condition to adapt to the physical problem under consideration .",
    "this will be important for the binary cases considered later , as that problem is certainly not static .",
    "the implementation evolves the system for as long as the code was run without any signs of instabilities . for this particular case",
    "we have evolved the system for more than @xmath123 . during this evolution , we have monitored the adm mass which we extract at @xmath124 and obtain @xmath125 which decreases by less than @xmath126 for the coarsest / finest resolution considered ( @xmath127 for the innermost grid ) by the time we stop the code .",
    "this illustrates the ability of the code to preserve this conserved quantity for long times .",
    "we have also checked that for this particular solution , both the harmonic and the static coordinates agree at the center of symmetry .",
    "this implies that the scalar field should have the same local oscillatory behavior  ( [ oscillatory_ansatz ] ) at @xmath128 in both coordinate systems .",
    "this is indeed the case and is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ sphi ] . in particular ,",
    "the measured oscillation frequency is @xmath129 , additionally , we have checked that the absolute value of scalar field at the center of the star varies by at most @xmath130 for the coarsest / highest resolution considered .",
    "coordinate effects do arise however .",
    "as mentioned above the geometry should have some non - trivial coordinate - induced dynamics since we are not adopting a coordinate system on which the solution is explicitly static .",
    "this effect can be seen in fig .",
    "[ singleg11 ] where the evolution of the maximum of @xmath131 as a function of coordinate time @xmath132 for 3 different resolutions is displayed . as evident in the figure , there is an initial transient variation of the metric value which later approaches a constant value .    finally , we monitor the constraints in fig .",
    "[ singlezconv ] .",
    "the figure shows the @xmath82 norm  ( [ zenergy ] ) of the physical constraints ( i.e. , the z - constraints  ( [ harmonicz ] ) ) and its behavior when the resolution is improved , converging clearly to zero .",
    "the measured convergence rate is @xmath133 between the low - and - medium and @xmath134 between the medium - and - high resolutions .",
    "initial data for the collision of two boson stars is obtained by a simple superposition of the single boson solution in a way described below .",
    "additionally , in order to consider different configurations , we take advantage of the following observations : + @xmath135 the solution of the initial data problem is unaffected by a phase difference in the ansatz assumed for the scalar field .",

    "notice that three fields ( the scalar field @xmath5 , the conformal factor @xmath147 and the lapse @xmath51 ) are enough to set an initial data consistent with the ekg equations , as it is described in the appendix . under this approach",
    "we are making the assumption that the boson stars are described with a single global scalar field @xmath5 instead of considering two sets of complex scalar fields to represent each star .",
    "this choice fixes in a straightforward way the interaction of the stars .",

    ", two identical boson star configurations are adopted to define the initial data .",
    "since the stars adopted have no initial velocity , their initial behavior is marked by a slow approach towards each other as they feel their gravitational attraction . as the evolution progresses however , the resulting behavior depends on the mass of the single initial boson stars .",
    "previous studies which concentrated on a particular set of initial masses , always displayed a collision of stars giving rise to the formation of a black hole @xcite .",
    "more recently , the work of  @xcite , which considered boosted stars with large kinetic energy , presented cases where the stars appear to pass through each other in a sort of `` solitonic '' behavior .    here",
    "we want to study the situation in which there is a final regular object ( that is , containing no singularities ) .",
    "to do so we begin with a broad parameter search along the masses of the boson stars searching for cases where the final compact object does not collapse to a black hole . as shown in fig .",
    "[ maxg11 ] , for stars with masses around @xmath152 ( corresponding to an amplitude of @xmath153 ) the final object appears to avoid black hole formation .",
    "this avoidance is indicated by the geometric variables tending to a smooth slow oscillatory behavior for @xmath154 while a marked violent behavior is displayed for larger values , together with a collapse of the lapse function .",
    "we thus focus on the particular case where each star has masses @xmath152 , which is approximately @xmath155 of the maximum allowed mass on the stable branch for the potential ( [ potential ] ) .",
    "the radius of the single star is around @xmath156 , and in this case we extend the computational domain to @xmath157 $ ] . as mentioned above , the refinement regions are rectangular boxes covering the centers of the stars and the span between them with a grid spacing at the region of the star of @xmath158 for the lowest resolution and @xmath159 for the highest one .",

    "the observed behavior can be regarded , to a certain extent , as being influenced by a  repulsive \" interaction of two objects trapped in a gravitational potential well .",
    "this leads to the objects oscillating around the coordinate position @xmath181 .",
    "elucidating the final fate of this system will require much longer evolutions ( making sure there is no causal interaction with the boundaries ) .",
    "additional comments about this case in light of result obtained in the other ones will be discussed in the conclusion section .",
    "the gravitational radiation produced in this scenario is considerably weaker than the previous case , as the involved objects never acquire significant velocities to induce a strong - time dependent quadrupole .",
    "in fact , our extracted radiation is of the same order as the spurious signal produced by the initial data . from these results coupled with the analysis presented in [ energy_considerations ]",
    ", we conjecture that the maximum of the radiation happens at @xmath182 while the minimum corresponds to @xmath141 being the radiation a smooth function of the phase difference .",
    "however this must be substantiated by studying several representative cases .",
    "+   +   +   +    c +      another interesting case is the collision of a boson star with an otherwise identical star except with the opposite charge density .",
    "such a star is called an antiboson star and rotates in the opposite direction as its partner in the complex plane .",
    "recall that the initial value problem solution was degenerate upon the reflection @xmath183 .",
    "additionally , while this change leaves the geometry unchanged , the associated noether change is affected by an overall sign change . in this section ,",
    "we study the dynamical behavior of a binary system composed of a boson and an antiboson star .",
    "the initial conditions for such a scenario are simply obtained with the following choice , @xmath184 we obtain the evolution of such a system , and as with the phase - opposition case , the early behavior agrees with that of the boson - boson case .",
    "as time progresses however , notable differences arise which are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ 2anti_q ] .",
    "the dynamical behavior when the stars are close is less strong than in the boson - boson case but more so than in the boson - phase opposition case .",
    "as a result , there is non - trivial generation of gravitational waves though their time - scale is longer than and their strength smaller than the boson - boson case .",

    "we have studied the behavior of boson stars both in isolation and head - on collisions with a three - dimensional implementation of the einstein equations .",
    "studies of the isolated star in section [ single_boson ] provided a non - trivial test of the implementation and showed it capable of accurately extracting delicate features of the solution such as the oscillation frequency . additionally by considering a coordinate condition not adapted to the static spacetime under study , the solution obtained further illustrated the ability of the harmonic coordinates to deal with compact objects in a smooth manner .",
    "we then considered head - on collisions of different configurations of boson stars .",

    "additionally , these scenarios provided an excellent test of the implementation under strongly dynamical conditions .",
    "this implementation is being employed to deal with black hole spacetimes , and the results will be communicated elsewhere .",
    "in addition to the notable differences obtained , it is interesting to pay a closer look at the position of the boson stars as a function of time .",
    "the positions are determined by the location where the energy density reaches a maximum in a given neighborhood .",
    "[ maximums ] shows the maximums of the energy density @xmath59 while fig .",
    "[ centers ] shows the proper distance between the origin and these maximums ( i.e. , that can be identified with the center of the boson stars ) located on the @xmath185 direction . due to the symmetry of the problem",
    "this is enough to draw conclusion on both stars .",
    "included in the figure is the position a star would have as dictated by a simple newtonian behavior of two point - particles with the mass of the boson star .",
    "a priori , since the initial separation of the stars is of the same order of their radii , non - newtonian effects would be expected to become relevant early on .",
    "this is clearly visible for the boson - boson and boson - boson in phase opposition cases , however , the newtonian result is a reasonably good approximation for the boson - antiboson collision .",
    "this results from the significantly different interaction between their scalar fields in these cases , while in the boson - boson case a merger takes place at relatively early times , in the boson - boson in phase opposition the stars approach and essentially go through each - other .    a further remark about the particular cases that we have evolved is that the difference between the coordinate and the proper distances , during most part of the evolution ( the early part ) , is given in all cases by a slowly varying function of time , compared to the time scale of the solution .",
    "additionally , these plots also explain , qualitatively , why the radiated energy is stronger for the boson - boson case since it is the one where the source s quadrupole has the most dynamic behavior",
    ". it would be tempting to regard this as further evidence that in rather simple scenarios , the coordinate behavior provides a reasonable description of the objects dynamics as seen in the context of equal - mass binary black hole cases @xcite .",
    "however one must be cautious in the present case as we are considering a particular model to define the scalar fields through a single complex field .",
    "also , interesting differences are observed when comparing our results with those of the study of q - balls  @xcite . here , the inclusion of gravitational effects modify the dynamics strongly . besides not needing to boost the stars for a collision to take place , the gravitational attractions of the stars in our case",
    "is evidenced by the `` trapping '' of the stars instead of `` bouncing apart '' ( for the boson - boson in phase opposition ) or going through each other ( for the `` boson - antiboson '' ) case as in  @xcite .",
    "finally , the results presented here illustrate the rich behavior displayed by binary boson star dynamics even in the rather simple scenario of a head - on collision .",
    "in particular , the dependence on possible phase differences revealed these phases strongly influence the outcome of the problem .",
    "in appendix [ energy_considerations ] we present a simple treatment that sheds light in the influence different phases or frequency - reflection in one of the stars description have in the dynamics of the problem .",
    "in particular , this treatment suggests that energy arguments explain why the boson - boson case gives rise to a merge while in the boson - opposition in phase boson case they seem to repel each other .",
