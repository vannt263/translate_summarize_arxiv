    "land surface temperature ( lst ) is a vitally important remotely observable tracer of mass and energy exchange across the interface between the atmosphere and the ground .",
    "lst derived from satellite observations is of interest in its own right for local climate studies and climate change monitoring , and as a component of studies of land cover , land cover change , surface moisture , and precision farming , among others @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , few surfaces at the bottom of the atmosphere radiate as blackbodies , and the parameterization of their surface state by means of emissivities complicates the task of accurate temperature determination .",
    "this paper continues the development of bayesian lst estimators that do not require accurate knowledge of surface emissivity , given radiance in multiple bands @xcite .",
    "the approach may be considered as complementary to the widespread use of regression - law based split - window algorithms .",
    "section [ section2 ] reviews the elements of the bayesian lst formalism .",
    "two implementations of the bayesian approach have been investigated .",
    "the first is the iterative contraction mapping algorithm presented in @xcite .",
    "the second is a maximum - a posteriori approach to lst estimation .",
    "section [ section3 ] presents bayesian estimates of lst and band emissivity for modis imagery .",
    "section [ section4 ] discusses results , and a final section [ section5 ] offers conclusions .",
    "appendix a presents a proof of convergence for the iterative algorithm , and estimates of the effect on lst retrieval of uncertainty in aerosol loading .",
    "we begin by recalling some of the results obtained in @xcite , which may be consulted for details .",
    "the probability of sensing radiance @xmath7 at the top of the atmosphere ( toa ) , given @xmath8 and an estimate @xmath9 of the variance of the sensor radiance noise , is obtained by a maximum entropy ( maxent ) argument .",
    "the maxent estimator assumes the existence of a forward model for the toa radiance in terms of @xmath10 and @xmath11 . for the case of a sensor aperture radiance forward model @xmath12 that is _ linear _ in band emissivity @xmath11 ,",
    "the posterior probability @xmath13 is gaussian in the mismatch between @xmath7 and @xmath12 in each band @xmath14 .",
    "we also have @xmath15 as the posterior probability for all bands jointly .    given radiance @xmath7 in n bands detected at the top of the atmosphere ( toa ) that originates from a patch on the earth s surface by a sensor with noise radiance @xmath9 , the posterior probability that the surface is at a temperature t is given by bayes theorem as @xmath16 equation ( [ eqn3 ] ) is evaluated with aid of the prior probability for the surface to be at temperature t and emissivity @xmath11 given available knowledge @xmath17 , @xmath18 the result is a posterior probability density .",
    "if one is ignorant of , or unconcerned with , the value of emissivity , it is possible to marginalize on the nuisance variable @xmath11 : @xmath19 and @xmath20 may be expressed in closed form using error functions .",
    "the explicit form is given in @xcite .",
    "we desire to find an estimator for surface temperature using the posterior probability given by bayes theorem ( [ eqn3 ] ) .",
    "two lst algorithms have been developed .",
    "the first , recounted in @xcite , iteratively computes expectation values of lst and band emissivities from their posterior probabilities while contracting the range of _ a - priori _ limits on these parameters .",
    "the second calculational method is search for the maximum _ a - posteriori _ probability ( map ) value of lst that maximises @xmath21 .",
    "the motivation for investigating a map formulation for the bayesian lst estimator is simple .",
    "the original bayesian lst algorithm presented in @xcite obtains estimates of lst and band emissivity by iterative refinement of expectation values for these quantities . even though the posterior probability for surface t is a closed - form expression",
    ", this procedure is computationally intensive .",
    "moreover , extensions to the estimator ( such as , for example , a more careful treatment of the forward model , or incorporation of calibration error effects @xcite ) may deprive us of the comfort of the closed - form solution .",
    "the map criterion for an estimator promises to dramatically reduce the number of cpu cycles expended per lst estimate , and may yet preserve the ability to rely upon closed - form solutions .",
    "map lst estimates are obtained simply and quickly by a golden section search .",
    "it was conjectured in @xcite that the iterative algorithm converges in general .",
    "appendix a presents a proof that the iterative algorithm converges , and , in the limit , converges to the map estimate of lst .",
    "granted the robustness of the golden section search , the existence of a solution for the map estimator may not appear to be a concern .",
    "however , the map algorithm in general includes iterative refinement of the _ a - priori _ limits on surface emissivity .",
    "the existence of a unique map estimate for lst in that case follows from a straighforward adaptation of the method of proof given in the appendix .",
    "a desirable feature of an lst estimator is some means of assessing one s confidence in the accuracy of individual estimates . in the present case lst estimates",
    "are obtained by marginalizing over imperfectly known surface emissivities .",
    "it is naturally of great interest to explore means of judging the effect of an uninformative range for the _ a - priori _",
    "probability for @xmath11 .",
    "direct numerical integration of the posterior probability @xmath21 with respect to @xmath10 was used to calculate emissivity prior confidence intervals for lst retrievals presented in this study .",
    "suppose that lst uncertainties arising from an uninformative emissivity prior are independent of those originating from other sources of error",
    ". then the emissiviy prior confidence level may be combined with an estimate of the net effect of all other sources of error by adding in quadrature to obtain an overall lst uncertainty estimate .",
    "both the map and iterative versions of the bayesian algorithm have been applied to modis imagery .",
    "this effort took advantage of the availability of level 1b calibrated radiances and level 2 land surface temperatures ( used in lieu of ground truth ) for terra modis data granules through the goddard space flight center ( gsfc ) eos / daac website @xcite .",
    "level 2 atmospheric profiles were obtained from the same site .",
    "the level 2 surface temperature product is used in preference to the standard level 3 product because it is in the same 1 km swath format as the level 1 b radiance data .",
    "the gsfc - supplied hdflook display package was used to manipulate the data granules and associated standard products .",
    "four modis data granules were selected for comparison of bayesian lst estimates with the mod11_l2 lst product . to the extent possible , granules were chosen to have large areas with gentle topographic relief and minimal cloud cover effects .",
    "a list of the granules used in this study appears in table 1 .",
    "two granules are daytime , and two nighttime . the nighttime granule for 2006 day - of - year ( doy )",
    "258 includes the alluvial plains of iraq and both the coastal plains and central plateau of saudi arabia .",
    "2006 doy 268 , also nighttime , includes the great plains portion of central canada .",
    "2006 doy 350 is a daytime dataset covering northeast africa , including large plains in sudan .",
    "2006 doy 347 , also daytime , covers much of the plains of central asia .",
    "the mod11_l2 product reported lst values for approximately @xmath22 or more of the pixels in all four granules .",
    "cloud - free pixels for which level 2 modis lst values were reported were selected for analysis .",
    "a number of cuts were made in selecting data from the modis products for surface temperature estimation .",
    "the use of level 1b radiance products combined with level 2 atmospheric profiles to generate lst for comparison with a level 2 modis temperature product introduces sources of error originating in , among others , imperfect georeferencing . thus one may expect errors in surface altitude to affect retrieval accuracy .",
    "these effects may be exacerbated by use of bilinear interpolation of 4 km horizontally reported profiles to the 1 km sampling of the spectral radiances . in order to minimize this source of potential error ,",
    "lst retrieval was limited to sensor zenith angles @xmath0 .",
    "cloudy pixels were masked by rejecting pixels for which the lst quality control mask bits 0,2,3,4 , or 5 were nonzero .",
    "lst retrievals were attempted only for pixels for which the dew point temperature at the base of the water vapor profile exceeded the freezing point of water .",
    "cuts were also made on the basis of nonphysical or otherwise pathological fields in the granule data : pixels for which the modis lst , the modis lst error , the surface temperature field in the profile granule ( otherwise not used in the analysis ) , the surface air temperature at the lowest level of the profile , or the surface pressure were less than zero , were eliminated from processing .",
    "finally , pixels for which surface pressure exceeded 1000 millibars , but for which the surface altitude was less than zero , were omitted from the analysis .",
    "neither ground truth nor surface meterological range ( @xmath23 ) is available as a standard product with modis granules .",
    "however , the presence of lwir bands in the split - window algorithm used to produce the modis lst product@xcite suggests that lst retrievals should not be too sensitive to the exact value assumed for vsby in the forward model .",
    "accordingly , this study replicates modis lst values assuming a nominal , but fairly large , value of @xmath24 for the surface @xmath23 parameter for clear pixels .",
    "appendix b presents a calculation which supports the contention that , for purposes of the present study , this approximation should not introduce large errors for clear air pixels .",
    "a random selection of 500 pixels was made from each granule , subject to data cuts described above .",
    "lst retrievals from both single - pass map and two - pass iterative versions of the algorithm were obtained for all granules . in addition",
    ", @xmath3 confidence intervals confidence levels for lack of emissivity knowledge were chosen to approximate the equivalent of @xmath25 intervals , given that @xmath21 generally displays some skewness .",
    "this should be borne in mind when when comparing with the effect of other error sources described by a standard deviation . ]",
    "were computed for the map retrievals by numerical integration of the posterior probability distribution .",
    "the bandset used in the retrievals appears in table 2 .",
    "the moderate resolution atmospheric transmission ( modtran4 ) code @xcite was used for the forward model calculations , as described in @xcite .",
    "the forward models incorporated mod07_l2 air temperature and water vapor profiles and assumed a @xmath26 mixing ratio of @xmath27 ppm .    initially , the prior probability in ( [ eq : prior ] ) was assumed to hold over the range @xmath28 for @xmath10 and @xmath29 in each band .",
    "however , it proved advantageous to restrict the range of the emissivity prior for modis bands 31 and 32 , @xmath30 so as to take advantage of the observation in ( wan and dozier 1996 , wan 1999 ) that most natural land cover types have an emissivity in excess of @xmath31 in these bands .    in the simulated lst retrievals presented in @xcite ,",
    "the equivalent noise radiance @xmath9 in each band was parameterized by a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) value obtained by approximately inverting the noise - equivalent temperature change ( @xmath32 ) for the specified nominal modis performance .",
    "experimentation with actual modis data revealed that the snr values so chosen greatly underestimated the random variance in radiance measured by the actual terra spacecraft against real terrestrial surfaces , through a real , and sometimes dirty , atmosphere . in consequence ,",
    "the snr parameter was reduced from values characteristic of ideal performance , in which the only source of radiance error in sensor measurements is accounted for by @xmath32 , by a full order of magnitude .",
    "in fact , the label `` snr '' is probably somewhat misleading , since the random variability it describes is likely the concatenation of numerous confounding factors , not all of which need accurately described as `` noise '' .",
    "it is retained because of its use in earlier studies .",
    "the snr values used in all retrievals reported in this study appear in table 2 .",
    "these values were selected on the basis of trial - and - error with pixels from doy 347 that were drawn independently from the selection used for comparison with the modis lst product .",
    "lst estimates are fairly insensitive to the exact values chosen for band snr s , so long as these are fairly large . if the snr values are too large , the noise variance estimate becomes so tight that the retrieval becomes pathologically overconstrained . in the most commonly observed pathology ,",
    "one or more of the individual band posterior probability fails to overlap the others ; _",
    "i. e. _ the support of the joint posterior probability becomes the null set .",
    "if snr is too small , @xmath33 for modis , lst retrievals become badly biased towards underestimates , and confidence intervals become worrisomely large .",
    "tables 3 and 4 present the mean , standard deviation and @xmath34 of the mismatch for each granule for map and iterative retrievals , respectively . in table 3 ,",
    "summary statistics for lst are shown for @xmath35 as well as for @xmath36 .",
    "a small number of pixels required relaxation of the snr parameter or emissivity priors in order to obtain an iterative lst estimate , in a pattern similar to that reported in @xcite .",
    "figures 1 - 8 display plots of the mismatch between map and modis lst values , with @xmath3 confidence intervals , and of mismatch histograms , for 500 modis pixels from each of the four data granules .",
    "overplotted on each mismatch histogram is the histogram for the equivalent gaussian error distribution @xmath37 note that the confidence intervals in the plots ( whose mean and standard deviation for each granule is given in the lst mismatch figure captions ) are for the uncertainty in lst resulting from the assumed uncertainty prior for surface emissivity only .",
    "thus , they do not ( directly ) reflect sensor noise effects or other sources of uncontrollable variance .",
    "agreement between the level 2 modis lst product and map lst estimates obtained in this study is better than @xmath2 in both mean and standard deviation of the mismatch for all granules . on average ,",
    "the mismatch with modis lst in table 3 increases only slightly for the looser emissivity prior .",
    "in addition to the tendency for the bayes lst retrievals to display a slight negative bias with respect to the modis product ( consistent with the observation made in @xcite ) the mismatch plots show evidence of a positive trend in the discrepancy with respect to modis lst .",
    "the trend is readily apparent to the eye for the daytime retrievals , but can also be discerned in figure 3 for ( nighttime ) doy 268 .",
    "map and iterative solutions reproduce modis lst comparably well .",
    "only the doy 347 retrieval shows a notably different mean mismatch compared to modis between iterative and map approaches .",
    "for both algorithms , @xmath34 per degree of freedom ( @xmath38 ) is close to unity .",
    "the best estimate of modis lst accuracy lies in the range @xmath39 to @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "the standard deviation of the map temperature mismatch in table 3 also lies in this range . a t - test shows the difference in means between modis and map lst values to be statistically significant for both nighttime granules and marginally ( at the @xmath41 level ) for doy 347 .",
    "however , the generally small level of the discrepancy indicates that , given better control of error sources , the bayesian map algorithm is capable of replicating the accuracy of the modis mod11_l2 product .",
    "a small number of retrievals for both algorithms have large discrepancies with respect to mod11_l2 lst .",
    "the cosmetic effect of these retrievals in the mismatch plots may give an exaggerated impression of their effect on the accord between modis and bayesian lst .",
    "judging from the mismatch histograms , they appear to be outliers resulting from pixels whose radiometric accuracy has been compromised by one or more of the error sources described earlier , despite imposition of the data cuts . in the case of the granule for doy 2006/350 ,",
    "two pixels out of 500 have a discrepancy in excess of @xmath42 .",
    "these discrepant values appear significantly out - of - family with respect to the largely gaussian appearance and favorable @xmath34 statistic for the retrievals as a whole . in table 3 ,",
    "the summary statistics for doy 350 are replicated with the two worst outlier pixels removed in the rows marked with an asterisk , with minimal change to the results .",
    "error sources arising from georeferencing errors in level 1b radiance products have already been discussed .",
    "an additional possible origin for the discrepancies with modis lst is errors in the forward model . among other causes , these could result from the fixed choice of @xmath43 ( _ vide .",
    "_ appendix b , however ) , or occur as a consequence of using erroneous values of air temperature or water vapor from the mod07_l2 profiles in modtran ( wan et al .",
    "another posible source is imperfect cloud masking in the level 2 modis products that could corrupt pixel radiances .",
    "this last source of error would afflict modis lst as well , and would have to affect modis and bayesian lst differentially in order to contribute to discrepancies . finally , the assumed band emissivity prior range need not always bracket the actual surface emissivity for a pixel .",
    "a noteworthy feature of the lst retrievals reported for this study is the comparatively small uncertainty for _ individual _ lst estimates originating in the assumed lack of surface emissivity knowledge .",
    "the mean value of the @xmath3 interval for individual granules is greatest for doy 350 ( daytime ) at @xmath44 and least for doy 268 ( nighttime ) at @xmath45 .",
    "as noted earlier , the emissivity uncertainty confidence interval depends upon the assumed level of random variance due to noise and other uncontollable factors capable of influencing lst retrieval .",
    "however , insensitivity of bayesian lst to emissivity seems likely to hold generally . in particular ,",
    "confidence intervals for @xmath46 differ little from those for @xmath47    it was remarked earlier that the bayesian approach to lst estimation was complementary to the more common split - window algorithmic family .",
    "the modis generalized split - window algorithm that furnished lst values against which performance of the bayes approach has been tested relies upon regression against a large training dataset , and requires assignment of pixels to emissivity classes . the bayesian approach , while statistical in its treatment of emissivity uncertainty , relies upon radiative transfer theory , rather than regression of brightness temperatures against true lst , to invert radiance to surface temperature .",
    "it is thus a method of remotely determining lst that ( so to speak ) minimizes hostages to the fortunes of emissivity knowledge .",
    "the accurate reproduction in the mean of mod11_l2 lst in this study suggests the possibility of using the bayesian approach for virtual `` ground truth '' to train local or regional split - window lst algorithms .",
    "although the golden section search for the map version runs faster than the iterative solution in protoype idl ( interactive data language ) code , the difference in execution time is not great , and is in any event dominated by the execution time for the forward model calculations in modtran .",
    "however , the map version of the algorithm would seem preferable both on the basis of simplicity and because it readily admits extension to higher - dimensional searches for optimal joint estimates of lst and band emissivity .",
    "the performance of the bayesian land surface temperature retrieval algorithms has been tested in a small - scale study by comparison of bayesian lst estimates against the modis mod11_l2 lst product .",
    "both the original iterative contraction mapping search and a new maximum _ a - posteriori _ algorithm reproduce modis lst values with good accuracy . the mean mismatch with respect to the mod11_l2 lst product for maximum _ a - posteriori _ estimates does not exceed @xmath48 , and its standard deviation is less than @xmath2 , for any granule used in this study . for the iterative algorithm , the corresponding mean mismatch does not exceed @xmath49 , nor its standard deviation , @xmath50 .",
    "the agreement of the map estimates derived from modis level 1b radiance with the mod11_l2 lst is comparable to the claimed accuracy for modis lst .",
    "emissivity prior confidence intervals for individual lst estimates shown in section [ section4 ] show that lst retrieval accuracy with the bayesian approach is insensitive to modest uncertainties in surface emissivity .",
    "we conclude the map lst algorithm is a viable candidate for lst retrieval in circumstances in which band emissivities are poorly known .",
    "it has been shown ( _ vide .",
    "_ appendix a ) that the iterative refinement of expectation values underlying the tes algorithm presented in @xcite converges , in general . in the limit of vanishing support for the lst expectation values , the iterative approach is equivalent to the maximum _ a - posteriori _",
    "estimator for lst .",
    "_ acknowledgement : _ i wish to thank an anonymous referee for @xcite for suggesting the maximum-_a - posteriori _ approach .",
    "the algorithm used in @xcite iteratively refines the calculation of the expectation values ( [ eqn61])-([eqn63 ] ) below of surface temperature and emissivity in multiple bands by systematic contraction of the limits of integration .",
    "it has been found that this procedure , which is described in detail in ( morgan 2005 ) , converges rapidly and reliably in practice .",
    "however , to date there has been no proof that the algorithm actually converges in general .",
    "this appendix supplies such a proof .    for reference ,",
    "the expectation values for t given radiance in bands i , obtained from the joint posterior probability for observing radiances @xmath51 are @xmath52 assuming @xmath10 is known to lie between a minimum and a maximum , while a joint estimator for t given radiances in all n bands is @xmath53 an estimator for the emissivity in band @xmath14 is given by @xmath54      both surface temperature and band emissivities are assumed to lie within limits imposed _",
    "a - priori_. the surface temperature is limited to the range @xmath55 and emissivity to the range @xmath56 where the minimum and maximum values may be band - dependent .",
    "it is assumed that the maximum of @xmath21 is always included in the integration . in any workable procedure for iteratively refining surface temperature or emissivity by contracting the support @xmath57 $ ] of the integrations ( [ eqn61]-[eqn63 ] ) which define @xmath58 and @xmath59 , that support must bracket the maximum of @xmath21 as it contracts .",
    "otherwise , the most probable values of @xmath58 and @xmath59 would be excluded from the search , in violation of the maxent assumption that expected values should maximize the likelihood .",

    "these observations provide a degree of empirical support for the assumption that the lst retrievals presented in the main text should not be too sensitive to the exact value of @xmath23 used to parameterize aerosol loading in the forward model , so long as the actual @xmath23 is great enough .",
