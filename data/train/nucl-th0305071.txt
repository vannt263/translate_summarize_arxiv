    "there is increasing interest to apply the statistical model @xcite in a description of both particle yields @xcite and spectra @xcite produced in heavy ion collisions in terms of a statistically hadronizing transversely expanding fireball .",
    "the fitted parameters , and in particular the temperature , however , have varied considerably , ranging from as low as 110 mev @xcite to 140 mev @xcite to as high as 160 and 170 mev @xcite .",
    "this report examines these differences in terms of the different possible approaches to statistical hadronization , and studies data sensitivity to model choice .",
    "the most commonly used prescription for statistical emission of hadrons is the truncated cooper - frye formula @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 where @xmath2 is the particle s four - momentum , @xmath3 is the system s transverse flow , t is the temperature , @xmath4 is the normalization and/or chemical potential , @xmath5 is the statistical distribution of the emitted particles in terms of energy and conserved quantum numbers , @xmath6 describes the hadronization geometry and @xmath7 is a step function , which corrects for inward emission @xcite .",
    "the cooper - frye formula is appealing because it s the most general covariant way of describing statistical particle emission .",
    "however , its form is compatible with a variety of freeze - out scenarios .      as fig .",
    "[ globals ] shows , the resonance contribution @xmath8 is a non - negligible and strongly temperature dependent admixture to the total multiplicity .",
    "its role within particle spectra , however , is a matter of controversy .",
    "if an interacting hadron gas phase re - equilibrates resonance decay products @xcite , it might be more realistic to not include resonances when analysing spectra @xcite . direct detection of resonances @xcite through invariant mass reconstruction , however , suggests that at least in some cases their feed - down has to be taken into account . these resonances will have a different distribution than those produced directly , and their inclusion can shift the temperature by as much as 20 mev @xcite .",
    "if an incoherent system is considered , one can factor out the decay matrix elements ( the angular distribution of decay products and lifetime ) , and arrive at the distribution of `` daughter '' particles ( @xmath9 with momentum @xmath10 ) from `` parent particles '' ( @xmath11 with momentum @xmath12 ) by simply integrating over the available phase space @xmath13 in general , this expression can get very complicated , and montecarlo integration @xcite becomes necessary . for most cases considered here , where there is one feed - down and two or three body decays , eq .",
    "[ rfrom ] can be integrated semi - analitically @xcite .",
    "while including resonances in this way is computationally demanding @xcite , it can be implemented with no extra degrees of freedom .",
    "it is therefore straightforward to check the effect of resonance inclusion on @xmath0 .",
    "a large increase in statistical significance would be a strong indication that resonance decay products do in fact emerge from the system with little rescattering . otherwise , rescattering has to be taken into account .",
    "the handling of resonance decays is connected with the way particle spectra are normalized .",
    "several ways to normalize spectra are possible , and the fitted temperature could change significantly depending on the chosen method , since temperature becomes correlated to a different set of parameters .",
    "the simplest approach is to treat normalization of each particle as a free parameter @xcite .",
    "if the post - hadronization interacting hadron gas phase is long enough to allow inelastic interactions to alter the chemical composition of the fireball , this may be the correct approach . in this case",
    ", temperature will be correlated to flow but not to normalization .",
    "+ the arbitrary normalization means there is no way to include feed - down from resonances without introducing many more parameters ( the resonance normalizations ) into the fit .",
    "( if rescattering is significant , however , these parameters would be physically justified ) .",
    "alternatively , a common normalization volume , together with the introduction of flavor chemical potentials , can be used @xcite .",
    "this approach , justified by the success in handling short - lived resonances through thermal models @xcite , is consistent with a scenario in which post - hadronization dynamics does not change particle abundances or distributions significantly . it does not require extra degrees of freedom for resonances to be included",
    "however , feed - down from resonances means the fitted temperature will be strongly correlated with chemical potentials and reaction volume , in addition to transverse flow : most short - lived resonances have the same quark content as the lighter daughter particles , making their yield relative to the lighter particle dependent on temperature only .",
    "hence , temperature will influence both absolute normalization ( correlating it with volume , chemical potentials ) and the slope ( correlating it with flow ) .",
    "if chemical potentials are used , the eventuality of chemical non - equilibrium raises the possibility that , additionally to chemical potentials , the flavor phase space occupancy parameter @xmath14 needs to be used for either strange @xcite or light @xcite flavors .",
    "if these parameters are used , they will correlate temperature with chemical potential even more strongly , since , just like temperature , @xmath14 affects particles and antiparticles abundance in the same way .",
    "several choices of the freeze - out geometry @xmath6 are possible .",
    "this choice is important both for getting a full understanding of how freeze - out happens @xcite and because it correlates with the shape of particle spectra , and hence on parameters such as transverse flow and temperature .    measured rhic rapidity distributions @xcite indicate that around midrapidity bjorken boost - invariance @xcite holds .",
    "this , together with cylindrical symmetry ( appropriate for the most central collisions ) constrains @xmath15 to be of the form @xcite",
    "@xmath16\\\\ p^{\\mu } d\\sigma_{\\mu}=(m_t \\cosh(y - y_l)-\\frac{\\partial t_f}{\\partial r } p_t \\cos(\\theta-\\phi))r dr dy\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 are the particle s rapidity and momentum directions , while @xmath18 are the longitudinal rapidity and emission angle of the freeze - out hypersurface .",
    "@xmath19 is the freeze - out time in a longitudinally co - moving frame .",
    "it is clear that several freeze - out models can be produced with different choices of @xmath20 , giving quantitatively different results .",
    "it is also clear that the choice of @xmath20 might influence fitted parameters such as temperature , transverse velocity and normalization .",
    "recently published fits use a variety of freeze - out geometries :    * @xcite assume @xmath21 , i.e. emission is independent of radius .",
    "emission happens in the same lab momentum time .",
    "* @xcite fits @xmath20 as a free parameter , with the result being @xmath22 . +",
    "this indicates explosive freeze - out , driven by negative vacuum pressure @xcite * in @xcite freeze - out happens at the same proper time @xmath23 throughout the fireball , ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "freeze - out might have this form ( `` hubble '' freeze - out ) if dynamical effects are negligible during hadronization @xcite .",
    "an additional physical uncertainty , which is found to be correlated to flow and @xmath20 in fits , is the flow profile .",
    "hydrodynamics requires that each part of the fireball volume will in general have a different density and transverse expansion rate . for this reason",
    ", the integral over @xmath25 will in general span a range of flows , weighted by density function @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 just like the form of @xmath25 , the flow profile depends on the hadronization conditions .",
    "for instance , assuming that freeze - out happens at a critical energy density yields @xmath28 @xcite , while assuming freeze - out happening at approximately the same time in the lab frame leads to a power distribution for the transverse expansion velocity @xmath29 @xcite + one can approximate the flow profile with one `` average '' flow and assume @xcite @xmath30 however , this approach might result in a systematic shift of fitted parameters such as flow and @xmath20",
    "the ambiguities presented in sections 1.1 and 1.2 mean that it is important to study their effect on the statistical model s fitted parameters .",
    "one way to do this is to use a montecarlo to generate data according to a particular freeze - out model , and to see what happens if the `` wrong '' model is used to perform the fit .",
    "we have written a montecarlo program which can be used for this purpose . while a detailed description of the algorithm is outside the scope of this write - up @xcite , we shall provide a short summary of its features here .",
    "an acceptance / rejection algorithm is used to generate particles in a statistical distribution in the volume element s rest frame .",
    "the accepted particles are then lorentz transformed to the lab frame .",
    "( any flow and density profile , as well as any freeze - out surface can be accomodated ) .",
    "resonance decays are handled through eq .",
    "[ rfrom ] , using the mambo algorithm @xcite to generate points in phase space .",
    "output can be used to generate spectra or fed into a microscopic model such as urqmd @xcite .",
    "the montecarlo output was used to produce the data points in fig .",
    "[ globals ] .",
    "it can be seen that a boost - invariant statistical hadronization can explain the global properties of the system such as @xmath31 .",
    "it can also be verified that the role of resonances is absolutely crucial .",
    "we proceeded to generate three datasets of particles .",
    "each data set had a temperature of 140 mev , a maximum transverse flow of 0.55 , and out of equilibrium chemistry ( @xmath32 ) . generated particles include @xmath33 and their resonances .",
    "the three samples differ in their choice of freeze - out geometry ( specifically @xmath20 ) and flow profile :    sample i : :    @xmath21 and no flow profile , as fitted    in @xcite sample ii : :    @xmath21 and a quadratic flow profile ,    as fitted in @xcite sample iii : :    @xmath34 , the boost - invariant analogue    of @xcite .",
    "we have fitted the three samples to a variety of models , producing @xmath35 profiles for freeze - out temperature and the @xmath20 parameter .",
    "[ prof1 ] shows the profiles resulting in the fit to sample iii while samples i and ii are shown in fig .",
    "[ prof0 ] .",
    "a full chemistry model with resonances ( solid black line ) seems to be equivalent ( as far as the position of the @xmath0 minimum and the value of @xmath35 ) to a fit in which normalization is particle - specific ( dashed red line ) .",
    "however , the chemical potential fit has greater statistical significance since considerably more degrees of freedom are required for arbitrary normalization .",
    "if chemical potentials are included resonances become essential since a fit with chemical potentials but no resonances ( dotted blue line ) loses all statistical significance .",
    "similarly , the physical presence of non - equilibrium ( @xmath36 ) means chemical potentials have to include the non - equilibrium parameter for the fit to be meaningful ( black dot - dashed line ) . the freeze - out geometry does not seem to impact the temperature minimum that much .",
    "however , the correct freeze - out geometry can be picked out by a comparison of fits to different models by choosing the model with the lower @xmath35 .",
    "moreover , data sensitivity to temperature is strongly affected by freeze - out geometry : comparing the temperature profiles for different choices of @xmath20 ( figs .",
    "[ prof0 ] and [ prof1 ] ) it is apparent that the temperature @xmath0 minimum is more definite in the @xmath21 case . in the case of explosive freeze - out , the correlation between temperature and other parameters in the fit ( notably flow ) increases , resulting in a shallow @xmath0 increase at larger than minimum temperatures .",
    "finally it should be noted that flow profile , freeze - out geometry and temperature appear to be strongly correlated . if data sample ii is fitted with a distribution with no flow profile ( such as sample i ) there is a non - negligible shift in both the fitted temperature and @xmath20 , and a small rise in @xmath35 ( fig .",
    "[ prof0 ] , brown dot - dashed line ) .",
    "finally , we have perfomed a fit to the available rhic data .",
    "the data sample we used is the same as the one used for the montecarlo , but , since the star and phenix spectra had different trigger requirements ( notably centrality ) and acceptance regions , we have used two different system volumes , one for star particles and another one for phenix .",
    "the results are similar to the monte carlo data in many ways .",
    "the @xmath35 was only slightly larger .",
    "+ a fit with particle - specific normalization gives a very similar @xmath0 and fitted temperature to a fit including chemistry and resonances . if chemistry is included in particle spectra analysis , resonances and non - equilibrium are essential .",
    "the fit to freeze - out geometry weakly points to @xmath34 , a picture that is supported by the temperature @xmath0 profile , virtually identical to data sample iii .",
    "however , we can not claim our study to be complete in this respect , since we have not yet investigated the effect of including flow profile in the models .",
    "as montecarlo simulations have shown , the conclusion can differ once these are taken into account .",
    "[ twoplots ] shows the hyperon and pion spectra from the global fit of fig .",
    "[ fitdata ] .",
    "a comparison of the fits on the left panel confirms that a model with no chemistry is about as good at fitting particle spectra as a model with resonances and chemical potentials",
    ". however , the second fit also has predictive power : we have used the fitted parameters to predict the @xmath38 spectrum for the @xmath39 .",
    "unsurprisingly , we found that the @xmath39 should have roughly the same slope as the @xmath40s , but its total multiplicity should be about three times as big .",
    "we therefore suggest that a greater sample of spectra , in particular more spectra of heavy resonances taken within the same centrality bin as light particles ( to make sure both flow and emission volume are the same for each particle ) would help in establishing whether chemical potentials are a good way to normalize hadron spectra or not .",
    "the only spectrum which presents a significant systematic deviation for most models is the @xmath41 . as fig .",
    "[ twoplots ] ( right panel ) shows , most models fail to catch the upward dip of the low momentum pions , and indeed simple transverse expansion predicts the reverse trend @xcite .",
    "including resonances , and allowing for @xmath42 helps ( the latter is equivalent to postulating a pion `` chemical potential '' @xcite ) however , to fully account for the lowest momentum pions , even addition of resonances and @xmath42 are not enough .",
    "one has to add a power - law component to the pion spectrum @xmath43 this contribution ( roughly @xmath44 of the total pion yield in the best fit ) also accounts for the highest @xmath45 pions . such a parametrization has been justified @xcite and successfully used @xcite before .    in conclusion , we have presented a comparison of different statistical models currently used to fit spectra in heavy ion collisions . we have described how these different models arise from different freeze - out scenarios of a system hadronizing from a thermalized quark gluon plasma .",
    "we have used montecarlo simulated data to study the sensitivity to model choice of presently available experimental data , and have evaluated different models ability to fit presently existing rhic data .",
    "while data slightly favors a chemical non - equilibrium explosive freeze - out , there is not enough evidence to make a definitive conclusion about this issue .",
    "we hope the forthcoming 200 gev results will clarify this further . supported by a grant from the u.s .",
