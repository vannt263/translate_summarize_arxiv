    "we clarify the circumstances under which the features of @xmath0-statistics are observed and , most importantly , we demonstrate that the mechanism by means of which the tsallis entropic index @xmath2 arises is provided by the occurrence of dynamical phase transitions of the kind described by the formalism of mori and colleagues @xcite .",
    "these transitions , similar to first order thermal phase transitions , are associated to trajectories that link different regions within a multifractal attractor .",
    "the onset of chaos is an incipiently chaotic attractor , with memory preserving , nonmixing , phase space trajectories . because many of its properties are familiar , and well understood since many years ago",
    ", it is of interest to explain how previous knowledge fits in with the new perspective .",
    "the feigenbaum attractor is the classic one - dimensional critical attractor with universal properties in the renormalization group ( rg ) sense , i.e. shared by all unimodal ( one hump ) maps with the same degree of nonlinearity .",
    "the static or geometrical properties of this attractor are understood since long ago @xcite - @xcite , and are represented , for example , by the generalized dimensions @xmath3 or the spectrum of dimensions @xmath4 that characterize the multifractal set @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the dynamical properties that involve positions within the attractor also display universality and , as we see below , these are conveniently given in terms of the discontinuities in feigenbaum s trajectory scaling function @xmath1 that measures the convergence of positions in the orbits of period @xmath5 as @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "let us first recall that the feigenbaum attractor has a vanishing ordinary lyapunov coefficient @xmath7 and that the sensitivity to initial conditions @xmath8 does not converge to any single - valued function and displays fluctuations that grow indefinitely grassberger1 , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . for initial positions at the attractor",
    "@xmath8 develops a universal self - similar temporal structure and its envelope grows with @xmath9 as a power law grassberger1 , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we are interested here in determining the detailed dependence of the aforementioned structure on _ both _ the initial position @xmath10 and the observation time @xmath9 as this dependence is preserved by the infinitely lasting memory .",
    "therefore we shall not consider the effect of averaging with respect to @xmath10 and/or @xmath9 , explored in other studies @xcite @xcite , as this would obscure the fine points of the dynamics .",
    "the central assertion of the @xmath0-statistics with regards to the dynamics of critical attractors is a sensitivity to initial conditions @xmath8 associated to the @xmath0-exponential functional form , i.e. the @xmath0-deformed exponential function @xmath11^{-1/(q-1)}$ ] . from such @xmath12 a @xmath0-generalized lyapunov coefficient @xmath13 can be determined just as @xmath7 is read from an exponential @xmath8 .",

    "the _ fixed _ values of the entropic index @xmath0 are obtained from the universality class parameters to which the attractor belongs . for the simpler pitchfork and tangent bifurcations",
    "there is a single well - defined value for the index @xmath0 for each type of attractor as a single @xmath0-exponential describes the sensitivity @xcite . for multifractal critical attractors",
    "the situation is more complicated and there appear to be a multiplicity of indexes @xmath0 but with precise values given by the attractor scaling functions .",
    "as shown below , the sensitivity takes the form of a family of interweaved @xmath0-exponentials .",
    "the @xmath0-indexes appear in conjugate pairs , @xmath0 and @xmath19 , as these correspond to switching starting and finishing trajectory positions .",
    "we show that @xmath0 and @xmath20 are related to the occurrence of pairs of dynamical @xmath0-phase transitions that connect qualitatively different regions of the attractor @xcite @xcite .",
    "these transitions are identified as the source of the special values for the entropic index @xmath0 . for the feigenbaum attractor",
    "an infinite family of such transitions take place but of rapidly decreasing strength .    in the following section we recall the essential features of the statistical - mechanical formalism of mori and colleagues @xcite to study dynamical phase transitions in attractors of nonlinear maps and follow this by a summary of expressions of the @xmath0-statistics .",
    "then , in subsequent sections we present known properties and develop others for the dynamics within the feigenbaum attractor . amongst these",
    "we derive the sensitivity @xmath12 in terms of the trajectory scaling function @xmath1 , and use this to make contact with both mori s and tsallis schemes .",

    "our analysis below shows that this initial result gives a broad picture of the dynamics at the feigenbaum attractor and that actually an infinite family of @xmath0-phase transitions of decreasing magnitude takes place at @xmath29 .",
    "independently , tsallis and colleagues proposed @xcite that for critical attractors the sensitivity to initial conditions @xmath8 ( defined as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the initial separation of two orbits and @xmath57 that at time @xmath9 ) , has the form @xmath58 ,   \\label{sensitivity1}\\ ] ] that yields the customary exponential @xmath8 with @xmath7 when @xmath59 . in eq .",

    "these properties have been corroborated to hold at @xmath69 numerically @xcite , @xcite for sets of trajectories with @xmath10 spread throughout @xmath70 and analytically for specific classes of trajectories starting near @xmath71 and observed at specific times of the form @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 @xcite - @xcite .",
    "we explain the rationale for these particular choices of @xmath10 and @xmath9 in the following section where we examine the structure of trajectories inside the attractor .",
    "see fig . 1 .",
    "in fig . 1a we have plotted ( in logarithmic scales ) the first few absolute values of iterated positions @xmath75 of the orbit at @xmath76 starting at @xmath71 where the labels indicate iteration time @xmath9 .",
    "notice the structure of horizontal bands , and that in the top band lie half of the attractor positions ( odd times ) , in the second band a quarter of the attractor positions , and so on .",
    "the top band is eliminated by functional composition of the original map , that is by considering the orbit generated by the map @xmath77 instead of @xmath78 .",
    "successive bands are eliminated by considering the orbits of @xmath79 .",
    "the positions of the top band ( odd times ) can be reproduced approximately by the positions of the band below it ( times of the form @xmath80 , @xmath81 ) by multiplication by a factor equal to @xmath82 , e.g. @xmath83 .",
    "likewise , the positions of the second band are reproduced by the positions of the third band under multiplication by @xmath84 , e.g. @xmath85 , and so on . in fig .",
    "1b we show a logarithmic scale plot of @xmath86 @xmath87 that displays a band structure similar to that in fig .",
    "1a , in the top band lie again half of the attractor positions ( even times ) and below the other half ( odd times ) is distributed in the subsequent bands .",
    "this time the positions in one band are reproduced approximately from the positions of the band lying below it by multiplication by a factor @xmath88 , e.g. @xmath89 .",
    "the properties amongst bands of iterate positions merely follow from repeated composition and rescaling of the map and represent a graphical construction of the feigenbaum rg transformation @xmath90 , where @xmath91    also , the trajectory with initial condition @xmath71 maps out the feigenbaum attractor in such a way that the absolute values of succeeding ( time - shifted @xmath92 ) positions @xmath93 form subsequences with a common power - law decay of the form @xmath94 with @xmath95 , with @xmath96 when @xmath97 . see how positions fall along straight diagonal lines in fig .",
    "1a . that is",
    ", the _ entire _ attractor can be decomposed into position subsequences generated by the time subsequences @xmath98 , each obtained by running over @xmath99 for a fixed value of @xmath100 noticeably , the positions in these subsequences can be obtained from those belonging to the superstable periodic orbits of lengths @xmath5 , i.e. the @xmath5-cycles that contain the point @xmath101 at @xmath102 @xcite . specifically , the positions for the main subsequence @xmath103 , that constitutes the lower bound of the entire trajectory ( see fig .",
    "1a ) , can be identified to be @xmath104 @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the @xmath107-th principal diameter defined at the @xmath5-supercycle , the distance of the orbit position nearest to @xmath101 schuster1 .",
    "the main subsequence can be expressed as @xmath108 with @xmath109 .",
    "interestingly this analytical result for @xmath75 can be seen to satisfy the dynamical fixed - point relation , @xmath110 with @xmath111 .",
    "see @xcite , @xcite for @xmath97 and robledo3 for general @xmath23 .",
    "we now work out the relationship between the trajectory scaling function @xmath112 and the sensitivity @xmath8 at @xmath29 . to begin with we recall @xcite the general definition of the diameters @xmath113 that measure the bifurcation forks that form the period - doubling cascade sequence .",
    "the @xmath113 in these orbits are defined as the distances of the elements @xmath114 , @xmath115 , to their nearest neighbors @xmath116 , i.e. @xmath117 for large @xmath107 , @xmath118 ; @xmath119 . further , feigenbaum @xcite constructed the auxiliary function @xmath120 to quantify the rate of change of the diameters and showed that in the limit @xmath121 it has finite ( jump ) discontinuities at all rationals of the form @xmath122 .",
    "so , considering the variable @xmath123 one obtains @xcite @xcite , omitting the subindex @xmath107 , @xmath124 , but @xmath125 , and through the antiperiodic property @xmath126 , also @xmath127 , but @xmath128 .",
    "other discontinuities in @xmath129 appear at @xmath130,@xmath131etc . in most cases",
    "it is only necessary to consider the first few as their magnitude decreases rapidly .",
    "see , e.g. fig .",
    "31 in ref .",
    "the discontinuities of @xmath132 can be suitably obtained by first generating the superstable orbit @xmath133 at @xmath29 and then plotting the position differences @xmath134 for times of the form @xmath135 , @xmath99 , in logarithmic scales .",
    "the distances that separate positions along the time subsequence correspond to the logarithm of the diameters @xmath113 .",
    "1a and 1b where the constant spacing of positions along the main diagonal provide the values for @xmath136 and @xmath137 , respectively .",
    "the constant slope @xmath138 of the resulting time subsequence data is related to @xmath139 , i.e. @xmath140 .",
    "1a and 1b where the slopes of the main diagonal subsequences have the values @xmath141 and @xmath142 , respectively . from these two slopes",
    "the value of the largest jump discontinuity of @xmath132 is conviniently determined .",
    "a key factor in obtaining our results is the fact that the sensitivity @xmath143 can be evaluated for trajectories within the attractor via consideration of the discontinuities of @xmath129 .",
    "our strategy for determining @xmath144 is to chose the initial and the final separation of the trajectories to be the diameters @xmath145 and @xmath146 , @xmath147 , respectively .",
    "then , @xmath143 is obtained as @xmath148 notice that in this limit @xmath149 , @xmath30 _ and _ the @xmath5-supercycle becomes the onset of chaos ( the @xmath150-supercycle ) .",
    "then , @xmath144 can be written as @xmath151 where we have used @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "notice that for the inverse process , starting at @xmath154 and ending at @xmath155 , with @xmath156 one obtains @xmath157    given the known properties of @xmath132 we can readily extract those for @xmath158 for general non - linearity @xmath23 . taking into account only the first @xmath159 , @xmath160 discontinuities of @xmath132 we have the antiperiodic step function @xmath161 with @xmath162 , and",
    "this implies that @xmath163 when @xmath164 is continuous at @xmath165 , and @xmath166 when @xmath132 has a discontinuity at @xmath167 .",
    "as we make clear below , these behaviors for the sensitivity reflect the multi - region nature of the multifractal attractor and the memory retention of these regions in the dynamics .",
    "thus , @xmath163 ( or @xmath168 ) corresponds to trajectories that depart and arrive in the same region , while the power laws in eq .",
    "( [ sensitivity ? ] ) correspond to a departing position in one region and arrival at a different region and vice versa , the trajectories expand in one sense and contract in the other .",
    "we now make explicit the mentioned link between the occurrence of mori s @xmath0-phase transitions and the @xmath0-statistical dynamical properties at @xmath169 .",
    "consider @xmath170 , the simplest approximation to @xmath132 , yet it captures the effect on @xmath8 of the most dominant trajectories within the attractor .",
    "this is to assume that half of the diameters scales as @xmath171 ( as in the most crowded region of the attractor , @xmath172 ) while the other half scales as @xmath173 ( as in the most sparse region of the attractor , @xmath174 ) . with use of the identity @xmath175 @xmath176 , @xmath177 ,",

    "2a .    when the next discontinuities of importance in @xmath129 are taken into account new information on @xmath144 is obtained in the form of additional pairs of @xmath0-exponentials as in eqs .",
    "( [ sensitivity3a ] ) and ( [ sensitivity3b ] ) . in the next approximation for @xmath132",

    "the constant slopes of @xmath35 represent the @xmath0-phase transitions associated to trajectories linking two regions of the attractor , @xmath225 and @xmath174 , and their values @xmath226 and @xmath227 correspond the index @xmath206 obtained for the @xmath0-exponentials @xmath228 in eqs .",
    "( [ sensitivity3a ] ) and ( [ sensitivity3b ] ) . the slope @xmath229 coincides with that originally detected in refs .",

    "thus , the initial number of trajectories within each interval @xmath248 remains fixed in time , with the consequence that the original distribution stays _ uniform _ for all times @xmath249 , where @xmath250 as @xmath149 .",
    "we can now calculate the rate of entropy production .",
    "this is more easily done with the use of a partition of @xmath251 equal - sized cells of length @xmath252 .",

    "( [ sensitivity1 ] ) for @xmath8 holds in all cases , the @xmath0-entropy is given by @xmath259 while @xmath260 , as @xmath261 .",
    "it is important to clarify the circumstances under which the equalities @xmath262 are obtained as these could be interpreted as shortcomings of the formalism .",
    "first of all , the rate @xmath15 does not generalize the trajectory - based kolmogorov - sinai ( ks ) entropy @xmath263 that is involved in the well - known pesin identity @xmath264 @xcite - @xcite .",
    "presumably , the @xmath0-generalized ks entropy @xmath265 would be defined in the same manner as @xmath266 with the use of @xmath16 in place of @xmath267 .",
    "the rate @xmath15 is determined from values of @xmath16 only at two different times @xcite .",
    "the relationship between @xmath266 and @xmath62 has been investigated for several chaotic maps @xcite and it has been established that the equality @xmath268 occurs during an intermediate stage in the evolution of the entropy @xmath269 , after an initial transient dependent on the initial distribution of positions and before an asymptotic approach to a constant saturation value . here",
    "we have seemingly looked into the analogous intermediate regime in which one would expect @xmath270 , as we explain below , however , the answer to this question is not analyzed in this occasion .",
    "we have only considered initial conditions within small distances outside the positions of the feigenbaum attractor and have not focused on the initial transient behavior referred to in the above paragraph .",
    "as for the final asymptotic regime mentioned above it should be kept in mind that the distance between trajectories , from which we obtain @xmath13 , always saturates because of the finiteness of the available phase space ( the multifractal subset of @xmath271 $ ] that is the feigenbaum attractor ) .",
    "it is widely known @xcite that special care needs to be taken in determining @xmath7 from a time series to avoid saturation due to folding and similar limitations occur for @xmath272 .",
    "separation of incipiently chaotic trajectories , just as separation of chaotic ones , undergo two different processes , stretching which leads to the @xmath0-exponential regime in @xmath8 and folding which keeps the orbits bounded .",
    "therefore for @xmath9 sufficiently large eq .",
    "( [ sensitivity1 ] ) would be no longer valid , just like the exponential @xmath8 of chaotic attractors .",
    "this is the reason there is a saturation time @xmath273 in our determination of @xmath272 and this consequently supports our use of the rates @xmath274 in @xmath275 .",
    "our most striking finding is that the dynamics at the onset of chaos is constituted by an infinite family of mori s @xmath0-phase transitions , each associated to orbits that have common starting and finishing positions located at specific regions of the attractor .",
    "each of these transitions is related to a discontinuity in the @xmath1 function of diameter ratios , and this in turn implies a @xmath0-exponential @xmath8 and a spectrum of @xmath0-lyapunov coefficients - equal to the tsallis rate of entropy production - for each set of attractor regions .",
    "the transitions come in pairs with specific conjugate indexes @xmath0 and @xmath19 , as these correspond to switching starting and finishing orbital positions .",
    "since the amplitude of the discontinuities in @xmath1 diminishes rapidly , in practical terms there is only need of evaluation for the first few of them .",
    "the dominant discontinuity is associated to the most crowded and sparse regions of the attractor and this alone provides a very reasonable description of the dynamics , as found in earlier studies @xcite - @xcite .",
    "the special values for the tsallis entropic index @xmath0 in @xmath8 are equal to the special values of the variable @xmath0 in the formalism of mori and colleagues at which the @xmath0-phase transitions take place .",
    "therefore , we have identified the cause or source for the entropic index @xmath0 observed at the feigenbaum attractor .",
    "we found that the sensitivity to initial conditions at the onset of chaos does not have the form of a single @xmath0-exponential but of infinitely many interlaced @xmath0-exponentials .",
    "more precisely , we found a hierarchy of such families of interlaced @xmath0-exponentials .",
    "an intricate state of affairs that befits the rich scaling features of a multifractal attractor .",
    "this dynamical organization is difficult to resolve from the consideration of a straightforward time evolution , i.e. starting from an arbitrary position @xmath276 within the attractor and recorded at every time @xmath9 . in this case",
    "what is observed @xcite are strongly fluctuating quantities that persist in time with a tangled pattern structure that presents memory retention . on the other hand , if specific initial positions with known location within the multifractal are chosen , and  subsequent positions are observed only at pre - selected times , when the trajectories visit another region of choice , a well - defined @xmath0-exponential form for @xmath8 emerges . the specific value of @xmath0 and the associated lyapunov  spectrum @xmath277 can be clearly determined . for each case the value of @xmath0 is given by the values of the trajectory scaling function @xmath1 at one of its discontinuities , while the corresponding spectrum @xmath13 reflects all starting positions in the multifractal region where the trajectories originate .",
    "we remind the reader that the results presented here are independent from the dynamics of approach to the attractor as we have not considered the time evolution of initial positions @xmath10 outside the attractor and leave this case for future attention .",
    "interestingly , the crossover from @xmath0-statistics to bg statistics can be observed for control parameter values in the vicinity of the onset of chaos , @xmath278 , when the attractor consists of @xmath5 bands , @xmath279 large .",
    "the lyapunov coefficient @xmath7 of the chaotic attractor decreases with @xmath280 @xmath29 as @xmath281 , @xmath282 , where @xmath283 is the second feigenbaum constant @xcite .",
    "the chaotic orbit consists of an interband periodic motion of period @xmath5 and an intraband chaotic motion .",
    "the expansion rate @xmath284 grows as @xmath28 for @xmath285 but as @xmath9 for @xmath286 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this translates as tsallis dynamics with @xmath287 for @xmath285 but bg dynamics with @xmath288 for @xmath286 .    in summary ,",
    "we have obtained further understanding about the nature of the dynamics at the onset of chaos in logistic maps .",
    "we exhibited links between original developments , such as feigenbaum s @xmath1 function and mori s @xmath0-phase transitions , with more recent advances , such as @xmath0-exponential sensitivity to initial conditions @xcite and @xmath0-generalized identity between lyapunov coefficients and rate of entropy change @xcite .",
    "chaotic orbits possess a time irreversible property that stems from mixing in phase space and loss of memory , but orbits within critical attractors are non - mixing and have no loss of memory .",
    "our results apply to many other unimodal one - parameter families of maps .",
    "one example is the exponential function map @xmath289 studied in ref .",
    "@xcite as the simple ( monotonic ) change of variable @xmath290 indicates .",
    "comparable results would be expected to hold for the two other routes to chaos @xcite , intermittency and quasiperidicity , in low - dimensional maps as these exhibit both @xmath0-phase transitions @xcite and @xmath0-sensitivity to initial conditions @xcite , @xcite .",
    "clearly , our results establish a new feasible numerical scheme to determine the family of values for the entropic index @xmath0 associated to a critical multifractal attractor ( here via the diameter function @xmath1 ) .",
    "conversely , the computation of the sensitivity @xmath8 at the onset of chaos offers an original means to evaluate feigenbaum s trajectory scaling function @xmath1 or its equivalent for other critical attractors .",
    "additionally and remarkably , the perturbation with noise of this attractor brings out the main features of glassy dynamics in thermal systems robledo5 .        for recent reviews see , _ nonextensive entropy  interdisciplinary applications _ , m. gell - mann and c. tsallis , eds . , ( oxford university press , new york , 2004 ) .",
