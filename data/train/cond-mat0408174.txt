    "determining the atomic scale structure and the resulting electronic properties of complex material systems is an ongoing challenge in physics research .",
    "an especially interesting material with a complex structure is disordered gallium nitride ( gan ) .",
    "it has been predicted that fully amorphous gan has a well - defined band gap relatively free of in - gap states , and may provide a useful alternative to its crystalline counterpart.@xcite however , the amorphous state is not in itself unique , and different fabrication techniques give rise to a range of disordered structures .",
    "experimental studies have shown that the resulting optical and electronic properties depend sensitively on the details of this nano - structure , including the presence of nanocrystallites and impurities.@xcite    in this paper we report x - ray absorption near - edge spectroscopy ( xanes ) and raman spectroscopy results from disordered gan films containing varying levels of oxygen impurities ( gan : o ) .",
    "our principal observation is that between 4 and 21% of the nitrogen in these films is trapped as molecular n@xmath0 , interacting only weakly with the surrounding solid matrix .",
    "we have previously shown that the films grown by this technique range from nanocrystalline , with crystallite size of order 3 nm , to fully amorphous , with the latter structure correlated with larger levels of oxygen impurities.@xcite here we observe also a close correlation between the level of oxygen and the n@xmath0 fraction , and we speculate on the nature of this three - way relationship .",
    "the thin films used in this study were grown by ion - assisted deposition ( iad ) , where ga atoms are deposited onto a substrate in the presence of an energetic beam of nitrogen ions.@xcite the ion energy was typically 500ev , with a total ion current density of 0.2  0.4ma/@xmath1 and an overall growth rate of around 0.5 / s .",
    "the resulting films were between 50 and 1000 nm in thickness .",
    "excellent adhesion was obtained onto a range of substrates , including silicon , quartz glass , carbon glass , mylar , and stainless steel .",
    "the substrate temperature remained below 100@xmath2c during growth .",
    "two separate vacuum systems were used for the film growth , with different base pressures of @xmath3 and @xmath4torr .",
    "rutherford backscattering spectroscopy ( rbs ) and nuclear reaction analysis ( nra ) show that films grown in the latter system contain significant amounts of oxygen , as described below , while films grown with the lowest base pressure have low oxygen content close to the measurement resolution of 1 atomic  % ( at.%).@xcite elastic recoil detection ( erd ) analysis found hydrogen fractions of 0.5 and 7at.% in two representative films containing 1 and 20at.% oxygen , respectively . for all samples the carbon impurity content was below 1at.% .",
    "the microstructure and degree of crystallinity of the films was determined by x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) , extended x - ray absorption fine structure ( exafs ) , and transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) .",
    "all of the films described here are transparent across the visible and show an absorption edge at around 3.5ev.@xcite    nitrogen k - edge xanes measurements were performed on the canadian sgm beamline at the synchrotron radiation center , madison , wisconsin .",
    "the monochromator has a maximum resolution of about 70mev .",
    "data were taken in both the electron and fluorescent yield modes ( tey and fly ) , although we focus below on fly data where the penetration depth is about 70  100 nm and charging effects are not significant.@xcite the raman data reported here were obtained at room temperature from samples grown on silicon using a jobin - yvon labram spectrometer .",
    "excitation came from a 325 nm hecd laser with a focus spot size of about 2@xmath5 m , and a power of 1  5mw .",
    "and @xmath6 resonance spectra from trapped and gaseous n@xmath0 , respectively .",

    "inset : @xmath7 absorption versus average absorption between 430 and 440ev for a series of samples.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]   and @xmath6 resonance spectra from trapped and gaseous n@xmath0 , respectively .",

    "inset : gaseous n@xmath0 spectrum including contribution from transitions to high energy states.@xcite ( c )  xanes spectra from several disordered gan : o films containing differing amounts of trapped n@xmath0 .",
    "inset : @xmath7 absorption versus average absorption between 430 and 440ev for a series of samples.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    in figure  [ n2xanes](a ) we compare the nitrogen k - edge xanes spectrum from an iad grown gan : o sample containing about 8at.% oxygen with the spectrum from a single crystal c - axis oriented wurtzite gan film ( x - gan ) .",
    "the x - gan spectrum has an absorption onset at around 397ev followed by a series of peaks that can be understood in terms of the @xmath8-projected calculated density of states of wurtzite gan.@xcite the absorption onset of the iad grown film also lies at about 397ev , but unlike the x - gan sample , a large narrow peak centred at 401ev dominates the spectrum . at higher energies the iad sample spectrum resembles a much - broadened version of the x - gan spectrum , as expected for these strongly disordered films .",
    "a high - resolution scan over the 401ev peak reveals that it actually consists of at least five narrow absorption lines , the widths of which are limited by the monochromator resolution [ fig .",
    "[ n2xanes](b ) ] . also shown is the xanes spectrum of gaseous molecular nitrogen measured on the same beam - line , showing the vibrational splitting of the @xmath9 resonance ( the energy scale was calibrated using the known location of this peak).@xcite the similarity in peak positions and relative intensities allows us to attribute the 401ev peak to the @xmath7 resonance of molecular nitrogen trapped within the films.@xcite the inset to fig .  [ n2xanes](b ) shows the spectrum of gaseous molecular nitrogen expanded to include the contribution from transitions to high energy rydberg and multiple - electron excited states that begin at about 406ev ( n@xmath0 absorption data above 406ev taken from ref .  ) .",
    "the fraction @xmath10 of the nitrogen held in molecular form varies between samples , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ n2xanes](c ) by the variation in the relative intensity of the @xmath7 peak ( the normalization procedure is described below ) .",
    "interestingly , the films with the greatest n@xmath0 fraction are those that show the most broadening in the underlying gan : o absorption spectrum . structural characterization by xrd , tem , and exafs has indicated that these films are fully amorphous , whereas the films with lower n@xmath0 levels contain crystallites of approximate size 3nm.@xcite furthermore , rbs and nra measurements show that the amorphous films also contain high levels of oxygen , typically greater than 15 at.% , and it may be that a significant oxygen level is essential to stabilize the amorphous structure .    an estimate of the value of @xmath10 for each sample can be obtained in the following fashion .",
    "firstly , we note that the n@xmath0 makes no contribution to the absorption over the energy range 403  406ev , so the entire contribution in this window is from the gan : o matrix .",
    "the spectra in fig .",
    "[ n2xanes](c ) have been normalized over this range , resulting in an offset that develops above 406ev representing the extra absorption due to transitions to high energy states in the trapped n@xmath0 .",
    "as expected , the offset is proportional to the intensity of the @xmath11 peak , and thus to @xmath10 .    at photon energies far above the edge",
    "the absorption cross section becomes independent of the bonding environment of the absorbing nitrogen atom .",
    "( exafs oscillations are of insignificant amplitude here ) .",
    "therefore , we examine the energy range 430  440ev , where there is no evidence of structure in the absorption , and plot the average amplitude in this range against the fitted @xmath11 peak amplitude for each sample ( see fig .",
    "[ n2xanes](c ) inset ) .",
    "extrapolating these data shows that the absorption between 430 and 440ev would be about 0.54 ( on this scale ) in the absence of any n@xmath0 .",
    "the actual absorption varies from 0.57 to 0.69 , so the n@xmath0 contributes between 4 and 21% of the total absorption .",
    "thus we estimate that @xmath10 varies from 0.04 to 0.21 .",
    "it should be noted that the magnitude of the contribution from the gan : o matrix between 403 and 406ev depends on the density of @xmath8-projected electronic states in this range .",
    "this in turn may depend on the details of the microstructure , such as the degree of crystallinity .",
    "for this reason we chose not to use the x - gan spectrum to estimate the absorption when @xmath12 , and instead used only the disordered samples where , apart from the n@xmath0 contribution , there are only subtle variations amongst the spectra .",
    "although the normalization , and hence the value of @xmath10 , is only approximate , our finding that up to 21% of the nitrogen is in the form of n@xmath0 is consistent with independent estimates described below .",
    "we also note that the distinct resonant peaks above 406ev in the gaseous n@xmath0 spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ n2xanes](b ) inset ) are not apparent in the offset region of the iad gan : o spectra .",
    "this is consistent with results from adsorbed films of n@xmath0 , where interaction with the substrate usually broadens the resonances into a smooth continuum.@xcite    ) and gallium to nitrogen plus oxygen ( @xmath13 ) , plotted versus oxygen atomic percentage .",
    "the solid and dashed lines show the expected ratios calculated using the n@xmath0 atomic fraction determined from xanes data.,width=302 ]    the effect of oxygen incorporation on the stoichiometry , determined by rbs and nra , is plotted in figure  [ rbsvso ] .",
    "the ga to n ratio tends to increase above unity as the oxygen concentration increases .",
    "we attribute this to the substitution of oxygen for nitrogen in the gan matrix , so that the composition is roughly gao@xmath14n@xmath15 .",
    "there are relatively few reports in the literature on the properties of deliberately grown gao@xmath14n@xmath15 , but it is known that high levels of oxygen ( @xmath16 ) can be substituted into gan without substantially altering the lattice structure.@xcite we have found no evidence for the formation of a separate gallium oxide phase in tem , xrd , exafs , or raman measurements .    it was noted above that @xmath10 increases with oxygen content , with the minimum value 0.04 corresponding to near oxygen free samples and the maximum value 0.21 being obtained when the oxygen content @xmath17 . assuming a simple linear dependence we write @xmath18 .",
    "the solid and dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ rbsvso ] show , respectively , the variation of the gallium to nitrogen and gallium to total cation ( oxygen plus nitrogen ) ratios expected given this form for @xmath10 .",
    "the trend in both ratios is captured very well with no free parameters .    to the best of our knowledge",
    "there are no specific predictions in the literature regarding the energetics of molecular nitrogen defects in gan.@xcite given our growth technique , and the fact that all of the films contain some n@xmath0 , it seems likely that the ion beam simply buries some n@xmath0 during growth .",
    "indeed , trim calculations show that the penetration depth of the 500ev n@xmath19 ions is a few atomic layers .",
    "the cause of the correlation between n@xmath0 and oxygen content is less obvious .",
    "it is known that interstitial n@xmath0 is formed in tin and crn films when n atoms are displaced during surface oxidation.@xcite a similar oxidation process , taking place as the growth proceeds , may add to the n@xmath0 level in our films .",
    "alternatively , it may simply be that the more disordered structure associated with the high oxygen content films is able to trap more n@xmath0 . in any case",
    ", we stress that the gan : o matrix is stoichiometric in the sense that the anion to cation ratio , excluding the n@xmath0 , is approximately one in all films .",
    "this is in contrast to gan amorphised by heavy - ion bombardment , in which n@xmath0 bubbles form from displaced nitrogen , leaving behind a ga - rich lattice.@xcite     vibration at 2360@xmath20 , as well as the broad third order gan mode at 2200@xmath20 .",
    "the curve labelled has had the contribution from atmospheric n@xmath21 removed to give only the spectrum of the n@xmath0 trapped in the film.,width=302 ]    a portion of the raman spectrum of a low oxygen ( @xmath22at.% ) iad grown film , showing the broad third order gan mode at 2200@xmath20 , is shown in figure  [ ramann2 ] .",
    "for comparison , the spectrum from a single crystal gan film may be found in ref .  .",
    "also apparent is a narrow n@xmath0 vibrational mode at 2360@xmath20 , which represents a combination of scattering from n@xmath0 in the film and free n@xmath0 in the air between the sample and the microscope objective .",
    "we eliminate the latter by subtracting the signal obtained from a bare silicon substrate , where both spectra are first normalized using the molecular oxygen mode at 1556@xmath20 that originates solely from the air . the resulting spectrum , representing only n@xmath0 in the film ,",
    "is also shown in fig .",
    "[ ramann2 ] .",
    "note that raman probes the vibrational splitting of the electronic ground state of n@xmath0 , whereas xanes probes the same vibrationally split anti - bonding @xmath7 state .",
    "the raman peak at 2360@xmath20 , which corresponds to about 0.29ev , is therefore at higher energy than the splitting between the lowest vibrational levels of n@xmath0 observed in xanes ( 0.24ev ) .",
    "the laser spot diameter was about @xmath23 , so for the confocal raman microscope the air signal comes from a volume just above the sample of roughly @xmath24 , containing about @xmath25 n@xmath0 molecules .",
    "the gan : o absorption coefficient at 325 nm ( @xmath26@xmath20 ) allows the beam to probe the top @xmath27 nm of the film.@xcite as the trapped n@xmath0 peak has roughly 4 times the area of the peak from n@xmath0 in the air , the probed volume of the film contains approximately @xmath28 n@xmath0 molecules , corresponding to a density of @xmath29n@xmath30 . using the atomic density of crystalline gan ( @xmath31 ) to estimate the density of our films we find that about 3% of the nitrogen is in the form of n@xmath0 .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with our estimate of 4% based on the xanes results for this sample .",
    "the width of the trapped n@xmath0 peak is about 30@xmath20 , considerably broader than the corresponding value of 10@xmath20 for free n@xmath0 , and the broadening is most pronounced on the low energy side .",
    "the peak is also shifted to lower energy by about 4@xmath20 .",
    "the fractional peak width @xmath32 is only about 1% , implying that the nitrogen molecules experience a weak , but non - zero interaction with the host matrix .",
    "the presence of this interaction suggests that the n@xmath0 probably resides in interstitial sites in the films rather than within voids or cracks .",
    "it is interesting to question whether subsequent film treatments , such as thermal annealing , can influence the trapped n@xmath0 . to this end",
    "we have annealed a nanocrystalline sample containing about 10at.% oxygen at 700@xmath2c for 30 minutes under flowing nitrogen .",
    "after annealing the xanes features related to the gan : o matrix become somewhat sharper , and the @xmath7 peak decreases in intensity by approximately 20% indicating some loss of n@xmath0 from the film .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have used a range of experimental probes to characterize a series of highly disordered gan : o films .",
    "a detailed analysis of the data has demonstrated quantitatively the presence of molecular n@xmath0 in the films .",
    "interaction with the host matrix leads to only a small broadening of the n@xmath0 vibrational frequency . both the atomic - scale structure of the gan : o and the amount of n@xmath0 depend on the growth conditions , especially the level of oxygen impurities .",
    "these results highlight the sensitivity of the properties of such highly disordered materials to small variations in the preparation conditions .",
