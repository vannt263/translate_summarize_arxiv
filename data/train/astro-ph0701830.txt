    "this is opposite to what is usually found in e , where [ fe / h ] is an important driver of the correlations . by parametrising line indices using @xcite models we found that age can explain the observed slopes of h@xmath5-log(@xmath0 ) and fe - log(@xmath0 ) relations , while additional differences in @xmath1-element relative abundances would be required to explain the mg - log(@xmath0 ) trends . on the other hand",

    "it is interesting to notice that the standard deviation of the linear fits performed is smaller for almost all the indices in comparison to its counterpart from the index@xmath3-log(@xmath0 ) fits . assuming that mass is the fundamental physical parameter governing the properties of these galaxies , the improvement in the fits may be interpreted in the sense that @xmath2 is a better estimator of the dynamical mass than @xmath0 . to test this hypothesis ,",
    "the mass of these galaxies was parametrised as a function of @xmath8 and @xmath2 in order to compare how central indices correlate with both possible descriptions . @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the disk scale and effective radius of the bulge respectivelly and the mean @xmath8 was estimated within @xmath10 ( see figure  2 ) .",
