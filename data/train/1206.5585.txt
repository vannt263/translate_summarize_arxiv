    "since 2004 , a survey program to map @xmath0 emission in galaxies belonging to the local volume ( lv ) with distance @xmath2 mpc has been underway using the 6-m telescope at the special astrophysical observatory of russian academy of sciences ( sao ras ) .",
    "this project is approaching completeness , and the basic results have been published in a series of papers : karachentsev et al.(2005 ) , kaisin & karachentsev ( 2006 , 2008 ) , kaisin et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2011 ) , and karachentsev & kaisin ( 2007 , 2010 ) . in parallel to our survey , similar observations of nearby galaxies in the @xmath0 line were performed also in cambridge and arizona universities , which review is published by kennicutt et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . at present",
    ", the degree of completeness of the @xmath0 survey of the lv objects exceeds 90% in the northern hemisphere , but the observations in the southern hemisphere have not been so successful so far .",
    "essential input to the @xmath0 survey of northern lv galaxies was introduced by observations with the 6-meter bta telescope of sao ras . for a continuation of the survey into the southern sky we used facilities of the 2-meter telescope of girawali observatory ( iucaa ) situated at the geographic latitude of @xmath3 . in this paper we present results from the observing runs during 2009 - 2010 , which have yeilded @xmath0 fluxes and sfr for 30 nearby dwarf galaxies .",
    "observations of the nearby dwarf galaxies were performed using the 2-m telescope at the iucaa girawali observatory , located near pune , india .",
    "the average seeing was 1.5@xmath4 during most of the observing period .",
    "images of the galaxies were recorded with the iucaa faint object spectrograph and camera instrument , equipped with a eev @xmath5 ccd which provides a 10.5@xmath6 field of view with a resolution of 0.31@xmath4 per pixel .",
    "the images were obtained via an interference @xmath0 filter with an effective wavelength 6563  and bandwidth fwhm = 84 , and also with the standard wide - band @xmath7-filter to subtract a continuum .",
    "the typical exposure time was 1200 sec in the @xmath0 line and 600 sec in the continuum . since the range of radial velocities in our sample is small , we used one and the same filters for all the observed objects .",
    "the eso - midas astronomy data reduction package was used to process our obtained data . to confirm the quality of the results ,",
    "comparisons between different nights and standard stars were done .",
    "the observational data were processed in the standard way that included : bias subtracting , flat - fielding by twilight flats , removing cosmic rays , and the sky background subtracting .",
    "the next operation was to align the emission - line image and continuum ones . here , psf matching was done to match the resolutions of the @xmath0 - image to continuum images .",
    "then the images in the continuum were normalized to @xmath0 images using 10  20 stars and subtracted .",
    "the measured @xmath0 fluxes of the galaxies were calibrated with spectrophotometric standard stars from hamuy et al .",
    "( 1992 , 1994 ) obtained in the same night .",
    "the internal errors for the @xmath0 flux measurements were typically about 0.10  dex .",
    "the major contribution to the error was from variable atmospheric conditions .",
    "the conditions of our observations are given in the column 11 table 1 , colon means that the sky was not photometric .",
    "we did not correct @xmath0 fluxes for the emission of the [ nii ] doublet , which is likely to be small , @xmath80.05  dex , in the case of dwarf galaxies ( lee et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "images of the galaxies we have observed are shown as a mosaic in fig.1 .",
    "the left and right images of each galaxy correspond to the @xmath0 plus continuum and in the @xmath0 minus continuum .",
    "the angular scale and north and east directions are indicated by the horizontal bars and by the arrows .",

    "the dashed line corresponds to a fixed sfr per unit @xmath22 and the solid line traces the known kennicutt- schmidt relatioship @xmath23 .",
    "as it is seen from the data of columns ( 8)  ( 10 ) of table , the star formation rate of a galaxy correlates with its luminosity , as well as with the amount of neutral hydrogen . to characterize the evolution status of a galaxy one can use the `` past - future '' diagram \\{@xmath24 } , where the dimensionless and distance independent parameters @xmath25 t / l_b)$ ] and @xmath26\\cdot t)$ ] determine the productivity of star formation in the past over the whole cosmic time t = 13.7 gyrs , and for how long the star formation can continue in future with the present gas resource",
    "actually , the @xmath27 parameter is equivalent to the widely used `` specific star formation rate '' normalized to the cosmic time t , and the parameter @xmath28 corresponds to the time scale to exhaust the hi mass ( in units of t ) , also often used by many authors .",
    "the titles of \\{@xmath24 } quadrants indicate conditionally an evolution state of galaxies in them .",
    "for instance , a galaxy with the constant sfr and the constant mass - to - luminosity ratio locates in the origin of the \\{@xmath24}- plane if it is able to reproduce its observed luminosity over the cosmic time t , and also has the hi amount to keep the observed sfr during the next t - term .",
    "most of bulgeless spiral galaxies and irregular dwarfs on the \\{@xmath24 } diagram are concentrated around the origin \\{@xmath29=0}. therefore , bulk of the local late type galaxies reside at a middle - way of their star forming evolution .",
    "nevertheless , the diagnostic diagram in figure 4 exhibits a significant scatter of galaxies on these parameters . as one can see , the sample of galaxies in fig.4 is slightly elongated along the diagonal @xmath30 . such a feature appears when the star formation in dwarf galaxies ( they amounts a majority in our sample ) is characterized by burst activity changing a rate of star formation over an order of magnitude .",
    "in particular , we may consider the bcd galaxy eso  553 - 046 to be just in a stage of star formation burst . under the present value of sfr ,",
    "the galaxy is able to reproduce its total luminosity during only 1.5 gyrs , and its gas resource would be sufficient to keep the present star formation rate on the time scale @xmath31 of the cosmic age .",
    "many other examples of nearby dwarf galaxies currently undergoing global starbursts are presented by lee et al .",
    "( 2009 )    note that stinson et al .",
    "( 2007 ) simulated evolution of dwarf irregular galaxies taking into account effects of gas outflows due to the wind from sns , and found cyclic bursts of star formation on the scale of 0.3 gyr with an amplitude of about ( 2 - 3 ) magnitudes for dwarf systems of very low mass . on the other hand , as it was shown by lee et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , the dwarfs that are currently experiencing massive global bursts consist of only 6/their number , and bursts are responsible for about a quarter of the total star formation in the dwarf population .    the `` replenished catalog of nearby galaxies '' ( karachentsev et al .",
    "2012 ) contains 825 galaxies residing in the local volume . among them , there are about 500 galaxies with measured h - alpha fluxes and about 700 galaxies having estimates of sfr from fuv- magnitudes measured with galex ( martin et al . 2005 ) .",
