    "the self - consistent nuclear meanfield for finite nuclear systems is an attractive potential as a whole and nucleons in a nucleus are bound in such an attractive single - particle potential .",
    "the attractive nature of the nuclear potentials is smoothly connected to the positive - energy region of the nucleon scattering states  @xcite .",
    "the optical potentials for low - energy nucleons scattered by finite nuclei are known to have an attractive real part together with an absorptive imaginary part .",
    "however , the optical potential for nucleons is highly dependent on the incident energy and the depth of the attractive real part is known to become shallower as the increase of the energy .",
    "the strength of the interior part decreases more rapidly than that of the surface part , leading to the so - called wine - bottle - bottom ( wbb ) shape for @xmath5 mev , and finally the potential changes its sign from negative ( attractive ) to positive ( repulsive ) , first at the interior part and then at the surface part also around @xmath6 mev  @xcite .",
    "the origin of such transition of the optical potentials from attractive to repulsive has been discussed microscopically based on nucleon - nucleon interactions both in the relativistic and non - relativistic frameworks .",
    "a similar attractive - to - repulsive transition of optical potentials was found for intermediate - energies deuteron - nucleus scattering  @xcite .",
    "the similarity of proton scattering and deuteron scattering is quite natural for high scattering energies because of the small binding energy of deuteron .",
    "the characteristic feature of deuteron scattering is known to be well understood in the picture of impulse or sudden approximation , in which the deuteron - nucleus scattering amplitude is written in good approximation as the coherent sum of the proton - nucleus scattering with the neutron being a spectator and the neutron - nucleus scattering with the proton being a spectator  @xcite . however",
    ", no such attractive - to - repulsive transition of optical potentials has been studied theoretically nor proved experimentally for scattering of composite projectiles other than the loosely - bound deuteron .",
    "the only exception was a report on the possible repulsive optical potentials for intermediate - energy @xmath7-nucleus scattering  @xcite but it was far from conclusive .",
    "recently , the present authors have proposed a theoretical model for constructing the complex optical potential for any composite projectiles through the double - folding - model ( dfm ) procedure using a newly proposed complex @xmath1-matrix @xmath8 interaction called ceg07  @xcite and demonstrated that the folding model provides quite reliable complex optical potentials for intermediate - energy scattering of light heavy ions , such as @xmath9o and @xmath2c , by various target nuclei .",
    "one of the major finding of this work is the discovery of the decisive role of the three - body force ( tbf ) effect ( or that of the three - nucleon correlations in nuclear medium ) .",
    "the repulsive part of the tbf is found to be of particular importance , which contributes dominantly at the density region higher than the saturation density @xmath10 .",
    "because of this repulsive effect , the strength of nucleus - nucleus potential is reduced strongly at short distances where densities of two nuclei overlap with each other  @xcite .",
    "the experimental data for elastic scattering of @xmath9o and @xmath2c projectiles by various target nuclei at @xmath11 mev are well reproduced over the whole angular range only when the @xmath1-matrix interactions with the tbf effects ( ceg07b or ceg07c ) are used in constructing the dfm potentials , while the data can not be reproduced at all with the use of the ceg07a interaction generated from the two - body force only  @xcite .",
    "since the tbf effect in nuclear matter plays an essential role to make the saturation curve and the incompressibility @xmath12 reasonable , these results implies that the proper nucleus - nucleus interaction models should be based on a consistent treatment of the properties of infinite nuclear matter and the optical potentials between interacting finite nuclear systems .",
    "another important finding was that the folding model predicted the repulsive optical potential for the incident energy per nucleon of @xmath13 @xmath14 400 mev  @xcite and the attractive - to - repulsive transition was found to occur below this energy , say around @xmath13 @xmath14 200 @xmath15 300 mev , although not explicitly mentioned in ref .",
    "these energies are apparently lower than the energies ( @xmath13 @xmath16 300@xmath17400 mev ) at which the proton and deuteron optical potentials start to change their sign from negative ( attractive ) to positive ( repulsive ) . to our knowledge , this is the first theoretical prediction of the repulsive nature of optical potentials for heavy - ion scattering based on the microscopic interaction model starting from the free - space @xmath8 interaction , although no experimental data exist so far on the heavy - ion elastic scattering in this energy range .",

    "it is seen that the dfm potentials with ceg07b is more repulsive by about @xmath53 mev at the origin ( @xmath54 ) than that with ceg07a at all energies , which is mainly due to the contribution of the repulsive component of the tbf  @xcite .    here",
    ", we should mention the reason why we still use the ceg07a interaction having no tbf effect in the present analysis of higher - energy scattering . in the previous papers",
    "@xcite , we demonstrated a decisive role of the tbf in properly reproducing the experimental data of elastic scattering at incident energies of @xmath55 mev and those data could not be reproduced at all by the calculation with ceg07a due to the lack of the tbf effect .",
    "however , in the folding model proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite ( and also adopted here ) , the energy dependence of the tbf have not been considered . in general",

    "we adopt here the two extremes , one with no tbf effect represented by ceg07a and the other with a rather strong tbf effect represented by ceg07b being nicely valid at least at lower energies @xmath56 mev , and test them to the higher - energy scattering . at the moment we can not mention which is better at each energy , but the true situation will be in between the two extremes anyway . what is important here is the fact that both interaction models predict strong repulsive potentials around and above @xmath57 mev .",

    "then , the attractive - to - repulsive transition is brought about by the sum of these four contributions . though the energy dependence of the dfm potential comes partly from the folding procedure of the exchange part ( eq .  ( 2 ) ) and partly from the genuine energy dependence of the @xmath1-matrix interaction itself , the latter play a dominant role in our present problem .",
    "basically , the energy dependence of the @xmath1-matrix interaction in the @xmath66 state can be imagined from the @xmath8 scattering phase shifts in these states , considering that our @xmath1-matrix represents a @xmath8 scattering in nuclear medium : when scattering energies of @xmath8 pairs in medium become higher with increase of @xmath13 , short - range repulsive parts of @xmath8 interactions make @xmath1-matrices less attractive or more repulsive .",
    "one notices in fig .",
    "[ fig:04 ] that the @xmath67 component has the largest energy dependence among the four components and plays a decisive role for the attractive - to - repulsive transition of the dfm potential .",
    "the difference among four components comes mainly from the two origins : one is the statistical factor @xmath68 included in @xmath58 .",
    "this factor is the largest in the @xmath69 state , which is the main reason for the largest contribution of @xmath67 to the energy dependence of the dfm potential .",
    "the other is the tensor - force contribution .",
    "the energy dependence of @xmath70 is stronger than that of @xmath71 , though their @xmath68 factors are equal to each other .",
    "the former includes the tensor force but the latter does not , which is the main origin of the difference between the two cases .",
    "if the @xmath1-matrix in the former is calculated with switching off the tensor force , its energy dependence becomes comparable to that for the latter .",
    "the tensor - force contribution is also important for the energy dependence of @xmath67 .",
    "thus , it should be remarked that the existence of the attractive - to - repulsive transition is the critical prediction in our approach based on the realistic @xmath8 interactions including the tensor force , even if the transition energy is affected quantitatively by the unknown tbf contribution .",
    "the nearside and farside ( @xmath4 ) decomposition of the differential cross sections is known to be a very powerful tool to understand the close relation between the attractive or repulsive nature of optical potentials and the angular distribution of differential cross sections in the semi - classical manner  @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we decompose the elastic - scattering cross sections calculated with the present dfm potentials into the @xmath4 components in order to understand the characteristic behavior of the cross sections with the increase of the incident energy , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:02 ] , and to clarify its close relation to the attractive - to - repulsive transition of the optical potentials , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:03 ] , predicted by the present folding model .",
    "we first depict the qualitative behavior of the incident particles ( or the incident waves ) under an attractive or a repulsive potential with a considerable absorption in the semi - classical picture . in case",
    "that there exists only a repulsive coulomb potential between the projectile and target nuclei in addition to an absorptive ( imaginary ) potential , all the incoming particles outside the grazing trajectories will , in the classical picture , be deflected to the scattering angles away from the target nucleus , which we define the positive ( or nearside ) scattering angles .",
    "now , let us define the scattering angle of the incident particle along the grazing trajectory as the grazing - scattering angle @xmath72",
    ". in the semi - classical picture , the scattering wave generated by such absorptive potential under the condition of repulsive coulomb field corresponds to the so - called `` edge wave '' generated at the nuclear surface along the grazing trajectory , the magnitude of which is shown to be symmetric around @xmath72 in the semi - classical limit  @xcite .",

    ", width=302 ]    in the realistic cases of nucleus - nucleus scattering , there exists also a real part of the inter - nucleus potential that is normally attractive ( @xmath73 ) . in such cases",
    ", the incident particle along or inside the grazing trajectory can be deflected to the negative ( farside ) scattering angles if the attraction is strong enough . in the semi - classical picture",
    ", this corresponds to the situation that the edge wave becomes asymmetric around @xmath72 , because the amplitude of the scattered wave on the target side is enhanced by the effect of the attractive potential .",
    "this causes the enhancement of the scattering into the negative ( farside ) angles that is compensated by the hindrance of the scattering to the positive ( nearside ) angles , which leads to a crossover between the nearside and farside amplitude at a certain crossover angle , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:05]a . in the crossover region ,",
    "the two amplitude have similar magnitudes that strongly interfere with each other showing a typical fraunhofer - type diffraction pattern in the angular distribution . at forward angles before the crossover region",
    ", the nearside amplitude dominates over the farside one , whereas the situation is reversed at backward angles .",
    "this is the typical situation widely seen in medium - energy scattering of light heavy - ion systems .",
    "however , the situation will completely be changed if the nuclear potential is repulsive ( @xmath74 ) , not attractive . in such a case , there exists no attraction that deflects the incident particle to the negative ( farside ) angles .",
    "namely , in the semi - classical picture , the farside component of the scattered wave will be reduced by the repulsive nuclear potential while it enhances the nearside one and , hence , no crossover between the nearside and farside amplitudes occurs , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:05]b .",
    "now , we have seen that the present folding model predicts the attractive to repulsive transition around @xmath13 = 200  300 mev region , the transition energy being dependent on the interaction used , and both the ceg07a and ceg07b interactions give repulsive potentials ( @xmath74 ) at @xmath13 = 400 mev .",
    "therefore , one may naturally expect that the effect of the drastic change of calculated real potentials with the increase of the incident energy should appear in the evolution of the calculated angular distribution of the elastic scattering . in order to understand the situation more quantitatively",

    "the attraction of the real potential is very strong , as already seen in fig .",

    "the nearside and farside components are seen to have comparable magnitudes and strongly interfere with each other showing a strong @xmath4 diffraction pattern in the angular distribution .",
    "the strong diffraction pattern implies that the contribution of the real potential becomes effectively minimum at the corresponding energy . in the case of ceg07b interaction",
    ", one can clearly see the nearside dominance with the reduced @xmath4 interference at @xmath13 = 400 mev , which is a clear signature generated by the repulsive nature of the real potential .",
    "these results strongly suggest a possible experimental evidence for the attractive - to - repulsive transition of the nucleus - nucleus optical potentials to be obtained by measuring the characteristic energy evolution of the elastic - scattering angular distribution in this energy region .",
    "namely , the evidence would be obtained by observing the farside dominance at the lower energies and the nearside dominance at the higher energies both with less diffraction patterns due to the reduced @xmath4 interference , together with the strong diffraction around a certain transition energy in - between caused by the strong @xmath4 interference due to the comparable magnitudes of the both components , although the predicted transition energy depends on the effective interaction used ranging from @xmath13 = 300 mev @xmath15 400 mev .",
    "the experimental determination of the transition energy will also provide us another evidence for the repulsive tbf effect as well as information about the energy dependence of the repulsive tbf effect that has not yet been taken into account in the present folding model with the ceg07b interaction as already mentioned .",

    "however , one should note the following point by comparing the potentials and cross sections",
    ". a close look at the calculated real potentials in the tail region for @xmath13 = 300 mev for ceg07a and 200 mev for ceg07b makes one notice that the potentials are still slightly attractive in the tail region despite the strongly repulsive values in the short and middle radial ranges . due to the existence of absorptive potential ,",
    "the contribution from the short - range part of the potential of a strongly repulsive nature should more or less be reduced by the absorption effect .",

    "width=245 ]    in order to see the effect of absorption on the elastic scattering more quantitatively , we plot the modulus of the @xmath30-matrix elements @xmath84 calculated with ceg07b in fig .",
    "[ fig:08 ] as a function of the _ effective radius _ ( or the so - called classical turning point ) @xmath86 defined by @xmath87 , where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the orbital angular momentum ( partial wave ) and the wave number of the nucleus - nucleus relative motion .",
    "despite the rather strong imaginary potentials , the @xmath30-matrix elements have considerable magnitudes for partial waves corresponding to the radial range well inside the nuclear surface down to @xmath90 fm , whereas they have negligible magnitudes for the @xmath91 fm region .",
    "in fact , we have confirmed with the notch test that the scattering cross sections are quite sensitive to the potential in the radial range of @xmath92 fm , while the potentials in the radial range of @xmath93 fm are irrelevant to the cross sections over the angular range discussed in the present paper .",
    "this is quite consistent with the fact that the scattering cross sections at @xmath94 200 mev still show the characteristic property of attractive potential ( fig .",
    "[ fig:07 ] ) despite that the real potential at this energy is repulsive in the radial range of @xmath95 fm , whereas the cross sections at @xmath94 300 and 400 mev reflect the repulsive nature of the potentials that have positive values in the radial range well outside 3 fm as shown in fig .",

    "( color online ) the @xmath30-matrix elements plotted in the complex @xmath30 plane .",
    ", width=283 ]    figure  [ fig:09 ] shows the same @xmath30-matrix elements @xmath96 in the complex @xmath30 plane .",
    "it is clearly seen that the phase shifts @xmath97 are positive for all @xmath88 values in the cases of @xmath94 100 and 200 mev , whereas in the cases of @xmath94 300 and 400 mev the phase shifts have negative sign for the partial waves @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the critical partial wave at which the phase shift changes its sign ( @xmath100 , i.e.  @xmath101 ) .",
    "the negative sign of the phase shift ( @xmath102 ) implies that the potential is effectively repulsive for partial waves less than @xmath99 . the effective radius @xmath103 corresponding to the critical partial wave @xmath99 is about 3.5 fm for @xmath94 300 mev and 4.2 fm for @xmath94 400 mev , respectively , while the calculated potential itself changes its sign around @xmath104 4.1 fm and 4.7 fm , respectively .",
    "this is naturally interpreted as , e.g.  in the @xmath94 400 mev case , the effect of repulsion in the radial range of @xmath105 fm is canceled by the effect of attraction outside 4.7 fm leading to an almost - zero phase shift for the corresponding partial wave @xmath99 .",
    "one should note that the @xmath106 values are large enough compared with the radius of complete absorption ( @xmath107 fm ) and , therefore , the elastic scattering at @xmath94 300 and 400 mev sufficiently probes the repulsive nature of the potential .",
    "thus , the existence of weak attraction in the low - density nuclear surface region , where the repulsive tbf effect is weak enough , together with the absorption well inside the nucleus ( @xmath108 fm ) will be the main origin of the fact we have just mentioned that the attractive - to - repulsive transition energy evaluated from the evolution of the scattering cross sections looks shifted to higher - energy side with respect to what one naively expects from the calculated potentials themselves shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:03 ] .",
    "the amount of the energy shift may depend on the magnitude of the absorption effect , namely on the adopted value of the renormalization factor @xmath20 for the imaginary potential and , in the next section , we examine how the conclusion depends on the adopted value of @xmath20 .",
    "now , let us discuss a possible range of ambiguity in the theoretical prediction for detecting the attractive - to - repulsive transition of the real potential through the observation of the angular distributions and their energy evolution .",
    "the first source of ambiguity comes from the unknown energy dependence of the repulsive tbf contribution in the effective interaction .",
    "this was already discussed in this paper and this is the reason why we have performed the calculation using the two types of interactions , the ceg07a and ceg07b .",
    "the former contains no tbf effect , whereas the latter includes the tbf effect but neglects its energy dependence which implies a possible overestimation of the tbf effect at highest energy .",
    "hence , the truth may exist between the two extremes , although one can not say in the present stage which is closer to the truth .",
    "same as fig .",
    "[ fig:07 ] but with @xmath20 = 0.8 ( left ) and @xmath20 = 1.2 ( right).,width=302 ]    the second ambiguity of the present theoretical model is the renormalization factor @xmath20 for the calculated imaginary potential . in order to see how the results we saw in figs .",
    "[ fig:06 ] and [ fig:07 ] depend on the adopted value of @xmath20 , we recalculate the cross section with different values of @xmath20 in the case of ceg07b .",
    "figure  [ fig:10 ] shows the results with @xmath109 and @xmath110 , instead of the original value @xmath19 used in fig .",
    "[ fig:07 ] . by comparing the results of fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] with those of fig .",
    "[ fig:07 ] , one see that the characteristic evolution of the calculated angular distribution with the increase of the energy does not change at all qualitatively , except that the transition energy ( at which the @xmath4 cross sections become comparable ) shifts by about 20 mev to the lower energy side for @xmath111 and to the higher energy side for @xmath112 with respect to the original case of @xmath113 shown in fig",
    ".  [ fig:07 ] , although the detailed energy variations are not shown in the figures .",
    "the @xmath30-matrix elements calculated with @xmath20 = 0.8 and 1.2 have quite similar behavior to what we saw in figs .  [ fig:08 ] and [ fig:09 ] with respect to the increasing energy .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the ambiguity originated from the choice of the unknown strength of the imaginary - potential strength does not affect the conclusion drawn in the previous section , except that the transition energy slightly changes ( say less than @xmath11420 mev ) with a rather drastic change of the @xmath115 value by @xmath11420 % .",
    "the experimental measurements of the energy evolution of the elastic scattering would rather give useful information about the @xmath20 value to be used in addition to the real attractive - to - repulsive transition energy .",
    "another source of ambiguity to verify the attractive potential from the measured angular distribution will be related to the `` uniqueness '' of the potential that reproduces the experimental data . as is well known , it is often the case for heavy - ion scattering that one can not determine the unique optical potentials phenomenologically from the measured angular distribution of the elastic scattering due partly to the limited angular range of the measured angular distribution and partly to the existence of the strong absorption , which prevent us to probe the interior part of the real potential strengths and shapes .    in order to investigate the uniqueness of the calculated folding potential with respect to the `` measured '' cross sections , we have performed the following test calculation . namely , we search for a model - independent `` phenomenological '' potential that reproduces the elastic - scattering cross sections calculated from the present dfm potential at @xmath116 mev that has the strongly repulsive real potential , by regarding the calculated cross sections as the virtual `` experimental data '' . in this analysis , we put a constraint upon the `` phenomenological '' potential that its real part is attractive rather than repulsive . here , we have used an automatic potential search code alps  @xcite to search for the best - fit values of the parameters .",

    "[ fig:13 ] , that completely conflicts with the systematic energy dependence of @xmath119 extracted from the optical potentials in the lower energy region . on the other hand ,",

    "this result preserves our hope to get a clear evidence of the repulsive nature of nucleus - nucleus optical potentials by measuring the elastic - scattering angular distributions in this energy range .",
    "the real part of heavy - ion optical potentials is believed to be attractive in the low energy region at least less than @xmath123 mev where experimental data for the elastic scattering exist .",
    "however , the potentials are predicted to change their character from attractive to repulsive around the energies of @xmath57 mev and to become strongly repulsive above @xmath22 mev by the microscopic double - folding model ( dfm ) based on the complex @xmath1-matrix interaction ceg07  @xcite . in this paper , we have shown that the tensor force plays an important role for lowering the attractive - to - repulsive transition energy of the dfm potentials by decomposing the potentials into the spin - isospin components .",
    "it is also shown that the nearside and farside ( @xmath4 ) decomposition of the elastic - scattering cross sections clarifies the close relation between the attractive - to - repulsive transition of the calculated dfm potentials and the characteristic evolution of the elastic - scattering angular distributions with the increase of the incident energy in the range of @xmath49 mev .",
    "no experimental evidence exists so far for the repulsive nature of heavy - ion optical potentials in this energy range because of the lack of experimental data above @xmath124 mev .",
    "therefore , on the basis of the present analyses , we here propose the experimental measurements of elastic - scattering angular distributions in the @xmath2c + @xmath2c system , particularly the careful measurements of the characteristic evolution of the diffraction pattern with the increase of the incident energy in the range of @xmath125 mev .",
    "more explicitly , we propose the observation of a strong diffraction pattern caused by the interference between the nearside and farside amplitudes , both having comparable magnitudes , around the attractive - to - repulsive transition energy , together with the observation of less diffractive patterns in the farside - dominant regime ( i.e.  the attractive - potential regime ) on the lower energy side as well as in the nearside - dominant regime ( the repulsive - potential regime ) on the higher energy side , that we have seen in figs .",
