    "the now frequent experimental observations of spin and/or charge modulations in the cuprate superconductors and related doped transition metal oxides @xcite was predicted by the `` frustrated phase separation '' phenomenology of emery and kivelson .",
    "their theoretical considerations @xcite involved the assertion that a doped mott insulator phase separates as a consequence of the competition between the kinetic energy of mobile holes and the magnetic energies of an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) phase with long - range correlations . while it seems unlikely that this scenario is correct in the strong correlation limit @xcite , when one adds the coulomb interaction into this problem emery and kivelson argued that macroscopic phase separation became `` frustrated '' , and the resulting anomalous normal state possessed low - energy fluctuations corresponding to stripes , or domain walls @xcite .",
    "to connote that these entities correspond to metallic stripes , it is now common to refer to these structures as `` rivers of charge '' @xcite .",
    "recent neutron scattering studies @xcite of the single - layer la@xmath2sr@xmath3cuo@xmath4 ( lsco ) system have revealed that ( at least in experimental results to date ) an elastic magnetic response associated with static stripe - like correlations are only found in ( i ) low @xmath5 systems ( @xmath6 ) at low temperatures such that the transport is that of a doped semiconductor @xcite , and ( ii ) in the famous @xmath7 system .",
    "one could interpret both the strongly disordered , low temperature results , and the @xmath7 data , as evidence that pinning effects are necessary , either from disorder or commensurability interactions , to produce static stripes .",
    "such arguments are consistent with the successful approach of tranquada and coworkers in producing static stripes that could then be observed in scattering experiments in a variety of systems @xcite .",
    "the low @xmath5 , low temperature region of the lsco phase diagram in which the static magnetic stripe correlations are found corresponds to the spin - glass phase of lsco",
    ". early magnetic resonance work on this system @xcite suggested that it is appropriate to think of this phase as a cluster spin glass , so named because small clusters of spins achieve their own short - range afm correlations , but the cluster - cluster ordering is spin - glass like . a numerical simulation of this phase , coupled with new crystals and new susceptibility data , lended support to this characterization @xcite .    in the latter paper @xcite ,",
    "one conundrum associated with the _ mechanism _ behind the formation of the cluster spin glass phase was pointed out , and goes as follows : the frustrated phase separation phenomenology claims that support for such physics is found in the existence of the cluster spin glass phase @xcite .",
    "however , detailed analysis of the transport in this region of the lsco phase diagram concludes that the transport is similar to that of a doped semiconductor @xcite .",
    "thus , at least in the low - temperature cluster spin - glass phase the competition between kinetic and magnetic energies does not exist in the form proposed originally by emery and kivelson , and the question can then be asked , does the absence of the holes kinetic energy from extended states not eviscerate the frustrated phase separation phenomenology as a viable mechanism associated with the formation of the cluster spin glass phase ? put another way , the numerical simulations of ref . @xcite that found evidence for the character of the spin - glass phase being like that of a cluster spin glass produced this spin texture with zero kinetic energy , and thus is the kinetic energy a necessary ingredient in the formation of stripe phases @xcite ?    this question becomes more important in view of recent experiments of julien , _",
    "these nmr / nqr results demonstrated the existence of a so - called charge glass at higher temperatures , followed by the appearance of the superconducting phase at lower temperatures , followed by the cluster spin glass phase at the lowest temperatures .",
    "the frustrated phase separation phenomenology predicts this sequence of charge glass / cluster spin glass phases , and thus unlike the above arguments , suggests that the cluster spin glass is stabilized by the pinning of the charge stripes by defects , followed by the subsequent freezing of the spin degrees of freedom within clusters defined by the pinned stripes of the charge glass phase .",
    "unfortunately , again , the transport of this system at low temperatures is insulating ( for , say , @xmath8 ) , so in the spin glass phase there are no rivers of charge which could `` carve out '' the domain walls of the cluster spin glass phase !    in this manuscript",
    "we present analytical results that formalizes the claim that via quenched disorder from the sr impurities one can produce the topology of pinned stripes without any kinetic energy . to this end",
    ", we derive the spin distortion pattern produced by such quenched disorder ( which frustrates the background afm order ) , and then demonstrate that this theory successfully predicts _ the stability of localized clusters of afm correlated spins produced in a situation with zero kinetic energy_. in this case , the origin of the stripes associated with the domain walls comes from the spin twists between the clusters , the clusters themselves having been produced by spin twists of the spin texture as the background spins attempt to accommodate the frustrating magnetic interactions produced by the quenched disorder .",
    "a well known extrapolation to higher temperatures @xcite then implies that the qualitatively identical spin twists generated by mobile carriers must be part of the mechanism associated with the formation of stripes .",
    "we wish to make clear that our paper does not claim to be the first to propose that magnetic interactions in general , and spin twists in particular , are important in the formation of stripes .",
    "firstly , the work of salem and one of us @xcite investigated the problem of frustrating fm bonds whose locations could be chosen such that the ground - state energy was minimized .",
    "it was found that when quantum fluctuations were included , if the magnitude of the frustrating interaction was smaller than that of the background majority spins , periodic stripes of frustrating bonds were the ground state configuration .",
    "( so , in these ground states , again there is no kinetic energy _ but _ stripe phases are indeed encountered . )",
    "secondly , when the frustrating bonds can not chose their ( static ) positions but are fixed by the sr impurity ions , the numerical simulations ( mentioned above ) of ref .",
    "@xcite suggested the presence of domain walls between the clusters of the cluster spin - glass phase .",
    "more recently , work of stojkovic and coworkers @xcite examined a version of the mobile hole problem by implementing a purely magnetic model that included the long - ranged spin twists produced by mobile holes ( as well as the frustrating coulombic energy between the carriers ) and found many of the magnetic structures encountered in @xcite , including stripe phases .",
    "lastly , white and scalapino , who find evidence for stripe structures in the @xmath9@xmath10 model for mobile holes @xcite , note that the charge and spin distributions of striped structures attempt to accommodate the frustration ( read : spin twists ) on the magnetic background produced by the mobile holes .",
    "looking at the totality of the evidence in this and the above - mentioned papers we believe that one can make a strong case that there is a _ similar mechanism _ at work in the formation of stripes in all of these situations , and that this mechanism is spin twists .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present a detailed theoretical analysis of the effects of quenched disorder on the spin texture in systems such as weakly doped lsco , producing a reliable analytical theory of the spin distortions both near the frustrating bond and in the far field .",
    "we use this distortion field to produce an accurate interaction functional between pairs of such bonds , which we then use to demonstrate the stability of such clusters in the cluster spins glass phase .",
    "in particular , this leads to a clear identification of the local afm order parameter of each cluster .",
    "finally , we show the resulting spin texture between two such clusters , and demonstrate how ( local ) stripe configurations can be stabilized in the cluster spin - glass phase .",
    "we consider the familiar model of magnetism in the cuo planes of the high @xmath11 cuprates in which the copper ions and oxygen holes are treated as a lattice of spins governed by a heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes a summation over near neighbour pairs of spins and the @xmath14 are the exchange interaction integrals .",
    "for an undoped lattice these spins are the cu spins and the exchange integrals are equal and negative ; the ground state corresponds to an afm ordered state on a square lattice . in what follows",
    "we simplify our considerations by using classical spins , implying that only the transverse ( _ viz . _ , moment reorientation ) and not the longitudinal ( _ viz . _ , moment magnitude ) spin - spin interactions are included @xcite .",
    "the simplest model of the effects of doping in weakly doped cuprates at low temperatures was proposed by emery , and corresponds to localizing the holes on oxygen sites and replacing the afm cu - cu superexchange for this occupied bond with an effective fm exchange .",
    "the phase diagram of the multiply doped version of this model was produced by aharony , _",
    "et  al _ @xcite .",
    "although detailed transport analysis of this part of the lasrcuo phase diagram @xcite has shown that a slightly different model @xcite of the localized dopants is required for a direct comparison to experiments , the fm bond model ( which we shall refer to as the frustrating bond model ) is more amenable to analytical study , for reasons that we shall elaborate on below , and shall be used throughout this paper .",
    "thus , we consider the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham1 ] ) wherein the @xmath15 label sites of a square lattice ( that is , only the cu spins and the effective interactions between them are considered ) and the exchange interaction integral between two adjacent sites @xmath16 and @xmath17 has the form @xmath18 where @xmath10 and @xmath19 are positive constants and @xmath19 represents the relative strength of the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic bonds @xcite .",
    "the doping level @xmath5 could be , say , either the sr doping level in @xmath0 or the ca doping level in @xmath1 ( noting that neidermayer _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite has shown that the phase diagrams in these two systems are identical ) . if we now choose a coordinate system such that linear combinations of @xmath5- and @xmath20-directed unit vectors span the lattice , then the hamiltonian can be written explicitly as @xmath21 where @xmath16 is summed over all lattice sites and @xmath22 ranges over @xmath23 .",
    "the equilibrium condition corresponds to that of zero torque from the local effective field at each lattice site : @xmath24    as is well known , the complication of treating a bipartite lattice ( labelling the two sublattices as a and b sites ) can be avoided by transforming the physical problem of fm bonds in a predominantly afm background into the mathematically equivalent problem of afm bonds in a fm background .",
    "these two pictures can be converted one to the other under the simple transformation ( afm @xmath25 fm ) given below : @xmath26    lastly , we note that the objects under consideration are classical spins , and we set their length to be one , scaling @xmath10 to be @xmath27 .",
    "further , the ground states that we discuss in this paper all correspond to situations in which the spins lie in some plane , and thus from now on we restrict our formalism to describe planar spins .",
    "we denote the bulk direction of the spins by @xmath28 , and at any lattice site @xmath16 there exists a spin @xmath29 characterized by the angle @xmath30 between the spin and the @xmath5-axis : @xmath31 we choose @xmath32 where @xmath33 is taken to be the average angle of the spins over the bulk of the material .",
    "that is @xmath34 so that the angle @xmath35 , defined according to @xmath36 , represents the deviation of the spin at site @xmath16 from the bulk direction .",
    "the collection @xmath37 of the spin distortions at each lattice site constitutes the spin texture on the lattice .    the numbering scheme for the lattice sites near the frustrating bond ( what from now on we call the bond sites ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice ] .      in a fm lattice doped with a single afm bond , the ground state solution to the spin texture is no longer obvious , and such a situation is called frustrated .",
    "we wish to produce an accurate analytical solution to this problem in both the far - field region and close to the frustrating bond .",
    "this will allow us to accurately track the energies of both the single and many bond problems .",
    "consider a purely fm lattice frustrated by the introduction of an @xmath5-directed afm bond between the @xmath38 and @xmath39 lattice sites .",
    "we shall denote the spin distortions at these sites by @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "the hamiltonian is then written as @xmath42 where the prime indicates the omission of the afm bond from the summation .",
    "it is no longer clear that the trivial solution @xmath43 represents the ground state since there may be another solution with @xmath44 that the takes the system to a lower energy state .",
    "as is well known , considerable information can be gained from an examination of the dynamical properties of a linearized system of equations of motion about a proposed equilibrium structure . here",
    ", we briefly outline this formalism , since it will be important to our later work . for our purposes , the dynamical behaviour of a lattice of @xmath45 independent spins",
    "is modeled sufficiently by @xmath46 close to the ordered equilibrium state @xmath47 , this behaviour is governed by the linearized system @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the derivative matrix of @xmath50 evaluated at the origin and @xmath51 is related to the spin texture according to the row vector @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "solving for the normal modes , and taking note of negative eigenvalues , the instability of the system to a non fm ordered ground state can be identified .",
    "this technique , when applied for larger and larger systems , reproduces the known result @xcite that an instability is first reached at @xmath53 and that there is only one stable spin texture for all @xmath19 exceeding @xmath54 .",
    "unlike such instability analysis , or the fourier - based approach of vanninemus ,",
    "_ et  al . _",
    "@xcite , here we wish to develop a continuum theory capable of describing an infinite lattice including the spins in the _ immediate neighbourhood _ of the frustrating bond . to this end",
    ", we proceed as follows .",
    "let @xmath55 be a function of a continuous variable @xmath56 which ranges over the entire @xmath57-plane such that @xmath58 .",
    "then , provided that @xmath55 is a smooth , slowly varying function of position , we may approximate the equilibrium condition for the undoped system ( to lowest order @xcite ) by @xmath59    now consider a fm lattice frustrated by the introduction of a single @xmath5-directed afm bond .",
    "the equilibrium spin distortions away from the core of the frustration are governed by laplace s equation .",
    "choose the origin of the coordinate system centred on the bond , and solve laplace s equation , in polar coordinates , by separation of variables .",
    "the imposition of the appropriate solution symmetries @xcite yields @xmath60 where we have adopted the convention that summations are over odd indices only .",
    "it is clear that for sufficiently large @xmath61 , the lowest order term dominates .",
    "that is to say , far from the bond the distortions are dipolar : @xmath62 where @xmath63 or @xmath64 .",
    "this agrees with the well known results in the literature ( see , _ e.g. _ , refs .",
    "unfortunately this result is inadequate for our purposes , since we also require the spin distortions near the bond .",
    "as we show below , a previous attempt @xcite fails , and thus we present new arguments leading to a valid solution close to and far away from the frustrating bond .",
    "other work has been unable to solve analytically this part of the frustrating bond problem @xcite ( although it is clear that they are aware of the issues that we have finally solved ) .",
    "we have written down a general solution to the static spin texture on the infinite lattice due to a single afm bond , and that solution consists of a linear combination of an infinite number of possible solution modes .",
    "however , since we have shown that the single bond system has only one stable solution , we expect that any prepared state will decay into the state of lowest energy given by the @xmath65 solution in eq .",
    "( [ eq : laplace_soln ] ) . that is every @xmath66 for @xmath67 . nonetheless , we run into the difficulty that the field equation to which eq .",
    "( [ eq : laplace_soln ] ) is a solution is not strictly valid at the bond sites .",
    "consequently , we can not expect that these solutions will perform well near the bond itself .",
    "indeed , we find that the purely dipolar solution with @xmath68 fall - off fits numerical solutions extremely well @xmath69 up to three or four lattice sites away from the bond , but that in the core of the frustration the deviation becomes quite large . at the bond sites themselves , the error is @xmath70 .",
    "we may ask , of course , why such a description does not suffice if , for the most part , we are interested in the spin distortions away from the bond .",
    "surely we can tolerate a small error at a handful of lattice sites ?",
    "the answer is that we can not . since the spin distortions are most severe in the immediate vicinity of the bond , the spins in the core of the frustration are a large contributor to the magnitude of the total energy stored in the distortions .",
    "thus a proper calculation of the energy in the system requires that we model the core correctly .",
    "equally important is that , for a given solution mode , the local equilibrium condition at the bond site determines the overall magnitude of the spin distortions .",
    "that is , it fixes the magnitude of the dipole moment associated with the distortion field .",
    "kovalev and bogdan , who suggested a continuum approach for the core region of this problem @xcite , fall into precisely this trap and hence obtain the wrong magnitude for the long range behaviour for the spin distortions ( see below ) .",
    "it remains to be answered how we might treat the spin distortions around the bond .",
    "ideally , we would like to treat the afm character of the interaction in the core as a small perturbation on the field equations , but this is not possible since the continuum formalism is badly behaved at the origin under the symmetries we have imposed .",
    "a second possibility would be to derive a separate discrete solution valid in the core and to match it smoothly onto the exterior continuum solution .",
    "however , we are inclined to avoid such a patch - work approach .",
    "not only is it somewhat inelegant , but it also defeats the purpose of introducing the continuum formalism , namely , to do away with discrete calculations altogether .    instead , we make use of the fact that the sets @xmath71 and @xmath72 are complete ( in the sense that any static spin texture satisfying the symmetries @xcite specified by a single @xmath5- or @xmath20-directed bond can be expanded in one of these bases ) .",
    "thus , to solve for the spin distortions everywhere on the lattice is essentially to fix the values of the coefficients @xmath73 . in the following , we attempt to expand the solution to the spin distortions of an @xmath5-directed afm bond near the origin in the basis @xmath71 .",
    "to start , we expect that the coefficient @xmath74 must dominate the others since @xmath75 is the mode of lowest energy .",
    "further , convergence at the bond sites requires that @xmath76 faster than @xmath77 as @xmath78 .",
    "thus , it is meaningful to treat the expansion @xmath79 , consisting of the first @xmath45 terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : laplace_soln ] ) as an approximate solution .",
    "we can then apply the local equilibrium condition at @xmath45 sites around the bond to determine the @xmath45 coefficients .    for concreteness ,",

    "we should ask whether the results we have obtained so far for the one and two bond problems can be generalized to allow us to tackle the problem of a lattice frustrated by the presence of any number of arbitrarily placed afm bonds .",
    "it should be clear that , in general , even for relatively few bonds , the induced spin distortions will be very complicated and the energy surface characterized by many closely spaced , low - lying states .",
    "in such a case one must resort to sophisticated computer algorithms to numerically generate the ground state spin texture , and the qualitative analysis of the cluster spin - glass phase from such work has been analyzed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "in contrast to that work , here we note that there are configurations of suitably high symmetry for which we can confidently treat the spins as planar and even solve analytically for the spin distortions and energies of all the possible states .",
    "the smallest such configuration is the square _",
    "cluster _ of parallel bonds .    by a cluster",
    "we imply a collection of bonds arranged in some local region on the lattice .",
    "that collection , call it @xmath163 , can be thought of as a set of dipole ",
    "position pairs : @xmath164 given a high symmetry cluster , for which a spin - planar ground state is justified , the spin distortions away from the cores of the bonds are given by @xmath165 which is the solution ( unique for the required symmetry ) to the equation @xmath166 the total interaction energy of the cluster can be written as the sum of all pairwise interactions @xmath167    thus , for instance , the @xmath168 square cluster of parallel bonds given by @xmath169 has a rather simple interaction energy .",
    "there are four possibilities depending on the the orientation of each dipole : @xmath170 in practice , however , the degeneracy of the middle two states is lifted by higher order terms in the interaction energy .",
    "indeed , the splitting observed in numerical simulations enables us to list the four distinguished states in order of decreasing energy .",
    "@xmath171    the first excited state consists of four similarly directed dipoles .",
    "destructive interference inside the cluster gives zero net distortion , but outside the cluster the dipoles add constructively so that the cluster acts like a single unit with a much stronger moment .",
    "this results in very strong long range spin distortions . far enough from the bond ,",
    "the spin distortions are given by @xmath172 since the long range spin distortions mediate the interaction between bonds , we expect a cluster of this kind to strongly couple to other bonds in the lattice .    in the ground state , for which the spin distortion pattern is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spins_gs ] , we have the opposite case : internally , the dipoles add constructively to give large distortions whereas outside they cancel to give very small ones .",
    "the absence of long range spin distortions implies that these clusters can only weakly interact with other bonds .",
    "most interesting , though , is that the internal spins are uniformly oriented but differently ordered from those spins outside the cluster .",
    "numerical solutions of the energies of this square cluster are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nrgs ] .",
    "the solid curves are our analytical results ( apart from a constant times the single - bond energy ( that is straightforward to calculate ) ) , and provides strong support for their usage . in the ground state this figure makes clear that the binding energy of the cluster can be quite large , especially for small cluster sizes .",
    "further , square clusters tend to settle into states with strong internal binding and which interact only weakly with other bonds . that is to say , a square cluster is a locally ordered domain whose local order parameter @xmath173 is non - collinear with spins in the rest of the lattice .",
    "however , this behaviour is a strong function of cluster size .",
    "this construction , and the energy plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : nrgs ] , demonstrates that such clusterings of spins ( in regions that are not too large ) are _",
    "stable_.    the relation of such clusters to stripes , or in the case of spin modulations , to the physics associated with the appearance of domain walls , can be demonstrated by considering the interface between such clusters , and to this end we have analyzed a six - bond cluster given by @xmath174 following the above analysis for four bonds , for the six - bond situation there are 64 possible choices of the dipole moments orientations , and these states have 15 different energies .",
    "the lowest energy configuration corresponds to @xmath175 and has a dipole - pair interaction energy of @xmath176 ( which is noticeably lower than the first excited state , which has an energy of @xmath177 ) .    the ground state spin texture for this location of the six frustrating bonds is shown in fig .  [ fig:6bonds ] .",
    "from this figure one can see the important result that this arrangement of spins is exactly what would expect if each @xmath178 cluster within the 6-bond cluster was in its respective ground state .",
    "thus , between these @xmath178 clusters one obtains a domain wall , of width one lattice spacing , over which the local magnetic order parameter is rotated . numerical evidence suggestive of this type of domain wall",
    "was discussed at length in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of a random distribution ( and orientation ) of a non - zero density of frustrating spin interactions , and it is clear that the same physics is at work in these two situations : spin twists .",
    "the above formalism has provided a detailed analytical theory of the spin distortions generated by frustrating bonds , and of the interactions mediated by the spin background between them .",
    "we have critiqued its validity by comparing to numerical solutions , and have found excellent agreement . then , by focusing on highly symmetrical distributions of frustrating bonds , reminiscent of local regions of bonds in the multiply doped state , we have used this theory to verify the existence of locally ordered magnetic clusters .",
    "most importantly , our work shows that these clusters are stable .",
    "these are the clusters envisioned to exist in the so - called cluster spin - glass phase @xcite of lsco and @xmath179 @xcite .",
    "it is to be stressed that it is believed that mobile holes produce the same kinds of spin distortions that are produced by the frustrating bonds discussed in this paper @xcite .",
    "thus , we believe that our results support previous suggestions @xcite that spin twists and distortions are part of the competing interactions that might lead to rivers of charge appearing as low - energy fluctuations in the doped cuprate systems .    we wish to thank marc - henri julien , john tranquada , kazu yamada , noha salem , and especially bob birgeneau and david johnston , for helpful comments .",
    "also , we thank frank marsiglio for a critical reading of the manuscript . the first draft of this paper was written while one of us ( rjg ) was visiting ictp , trieste , and he wishes to thank them for their hospitality and support .",
    "this work was supported in part by the nserc of canada .",
    "the question of the energy stored in the spin distortions can be answered by expanding the hamiltonian as follows : @xmath180    of course , the term @xmath113 represents the energy intrinsic to the lattice .",
    "therefore , the energy from the spin distortions alone is given by @xmath181    this in turn can be expanded using the continuum approximation @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the @xmath57-plane excluding a small region about the bond centre .",
    "the integral term of this expression must be evaluated .",
    "since the core of the bond occupies a unit disk at the origin , the appropriate value for @xmath184 is 1 .",
    "thus , one finds @xmath185 using the results for the mode characterization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ansatz1 ] ) gives @xmath186 and the identity @xmath187 allows us to write @xmath188 thus the energy in the spin distortions is @xmath189 which can be evaluated using eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi2_4 solns ] ) to give @xmath190 we stress that this expression includes the energy from the core of the spin distortion field .",
    "in accordance with fig .  [ fig : bond_geom ] , we write the spin distortion at the 0 site from the bond b as @xmath191 \\:.\\ ] ] a similar expression can be written down for the other bond site .",
    "then , by superposition , the difference between the net distortions at sites 0 and 1 is @xmath192 then we make use of the relationship between the spin distortions at the bond sites and the magnitude of the dipole moment : @xmath193 therefore @xmath194 so that @xmath195 and thus , by symmetry , the total energy is @xmath196 we conclude that the interaction energy is given by @xmath197 ( repeating the above calculation for two perpendicular bonds produces the identical result . )      for a recent comprehensive review , see j. tranquada , in `` neutron scattering in layered copper - oxide superconductors '' , edited by a. furrer ( kluwer , dordrecht , the netherlands , 1998 ) , pp .",
    "225 ; also , see references therein .",
    "the expansion of the continuum limit of the equilibrium condition can be generalized to higher order . nonetheless , since we expect @xmath55 to vary slowly as a function of position away from the bond , the second order equation ( _ viz .",
    "_ , laplace s equation ) shall suffice .",
    "if one does examine the higher order terms one finds higher angular harmonics for each order of @xmath199 which are small perturbations to the exact solution .    as per usual ,",
    "it is useful to consider what symmetries such a solution might exhibit .",
    "the natural point symmetry group on the undoped lattice is the dihedral group of order 8 , @xmath200 .",
    "an afm bond introduces a preferred direction in space and immediately singles out two lines , one running through the bond and the other bisecting it , as special .",
    "suppose that the bond is @xmath5-directed and is positioned suitably far from the edges of a very large lattice .",
    "then , using a coordinate system centred on the bond , we can say that the physical situation possesses reflectional symmetry across the @xmath5- and @xmath20-axes ; denote its symmetry group by @xmath201 .",
    "we expect solutions @xmath35 to the spin distortions to share these same symmetries in the sense that @xmath35 is invariant ( up to a global sign change ) under transformation by any @xmath202 .",
    "that is , at all sites @xmath16 , either @xmath203 or @xmath204 .",
    "in fact , we find that ground state solutions are odd in reflection across the @xmath20-axis and even in reflection across the @xmath5-axis ; this information will be employed in the text ."
