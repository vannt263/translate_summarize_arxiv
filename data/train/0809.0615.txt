    ", the potential can also be analysed through the force perpendicular to the galactic plane ( oort 1960 ; crz et al .",

    "; holmberg & flynn 2004 ) or through the coupling between the 3 components of the velocity in the solar neighbourhood @xcite . + here ,",
    "we concentrate on the question of the orientation of the velocity ellipsoid that is known to be tightly related to the shape and symmetry of the galactic potential @xcite .    in spite of the long interest in this problem , measuring observationally",
    "the orientation of the velocity ellipsoid outside of the galactic plane has proven to be very difficult .",
    "this is due mainly to the absence of reliable distances away from the solar neighbourhood . despite this limitation ,",
    "the first stellar stream detected within the milky way halo towards the north galactic pole by @xcite shows a velocity tilt , the ellipsoid being inclined towards the galactic plane .",
    "this tilt could result from the expected velocity correlation induced by a spheroidal potential if these stars had similar integrals of motion @xcite .",
    "however we note that this stream is not detected locally in the rave data @xcite .",
    "building realistic galactic potentials shows that the main axis of the velocity ellipsoid , at 1kpc above the galactic plane , points in the direction of the @xmath5-axis of symmetry of the galaxy towards a point located at 5 to 8 kpc behind the galactic centre : for instance from numerical orbit computations @xcite or applying to the @xcite galactic potential the @xcite formulae .",
    "such estimates of the velocity ellipsoid tilt are necessary for an accurate determination of the asymmetric drift @xcite , and for a correct measurement of the force perpendicular to the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper , we study the 2d velocity distribution perpendicular to the galactic plane for a sample of red clump stars from the rave survey @xcite .",
    "these stars are selected between 500pc and 1500pc below the galactic plane and provide a measurement of the tilt of the velocity ellipsoid at @xmath61  kpc . in section  [ s : sample",
    "] , we present the selection of the sample while section  [ s : tilt ] focuses on the measurement of the inclination and possible biases . finally , in section  [ s : model ] we compare our measurement to computed inclinations for two extreme classes of mass models and we discuss possible outcomes of this measurement .",
    "our sample is drawn from the second data release of the rave survey @xcite containing about 50  000 stellar radial velocities and 20  000 measurements of stellar parameters .",
    "we focus on red clump giants towards the south galactic pole to maximize the distance from the plane and minimize the interstellar extinction .",
    "hence , we select our targets in a cone with @xmath7 , and we use a colour  magnitude criterion following @xcite to select our candidate red clump stars : 2mass @xmath8 colour within 0.50.7 and @xmath9 .",
    "this colour  magnitude cut selects mainly red clump stars whose luminosity function ( lf ) is well defined and approximately gaussian : @xmath10 .",
    "also , the red clump lf is narrow , the dispersion of the gaussian lf being 0.22 mag in the @xmath11-band , and is nearly independent of the metallicity @xcite .",
    "it makes this population particularly suited to study the kinematics of stars away from the solar neighbourhood as reliable distance estimates can be obtained .",
    "also the extinction in the @xmath11-band remains low , @xmath12  mag with a maximum extinction of @xmath13  mag for this region of the sky @xcite .",
    "hence , extinction does not contribute significantly to our error budget : the average error on the distance is less than 1% with a maximum value of @xmath142% for the limiting magnitude of our sample .",
    "+ the selection criterion , retaining only the objects with a proper motion value in the rave catalogue , restricts the sample to 763 red clump candidates spanning a distance interval from the sun of 500 to 1500  pc .",
    "a small fraction of these selected stars are dwarfs or subgiants . according to the photometric and kinematic modelling of the sgp and ngp by @xcite",
    ", we can estimate that , at the limiting magnitude of our sample @xmath15=9.3 , 75% of the sample are red clump stars , 10% dwarfs and 15% subgiants .",
    "brighter than this limit , the fraction of red clump stars is larger and the quoted fractions are upper limits to our contamination fraction . + we clean our sample further using a kinematic selection .",
    "we select stars based on their velocities with the following criteria @xmath16  km  s@xmath17 and @xmath18  km  s@xmath17 .",

    "for comparison , a linear fit would not be biased due to the asymmetry of the errors but unfortunately it is more sensitive to outliers . to overcome this problem , we use a monte carlo sampling of the velocity error distributions .",

    "we note however that applying the errors on the orbit library ( direct method ) and correcting the anisotropy of the velocity errors ( unbiased measurement ) produces slightly different predictions for the tilt .",

    "hence , @xmath29 and @xmath31 errors increases with distance which is not taken into account in the monte carlo simulation for the direct measurement , the rave sample being too small to estimate properly the error laws as a function of distances .",
    "this effect is also reduced in the unbiased measurement but is still present since the correcting term is added to the true error , hence distant stars will still have on average large errors while nearer objects will have on average smaller errors .",

    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite all provide strong evidence for the absence of sgr debris in the solar neighbourhood .",

    "this suggests that the absence of the sgr stream near the sun is consistent with nearly spherical and prolate galactic potentials and seemingly inconsistent with oblate potentials . however , recently @xcite studied the magellanic system  milky way interaction using test particle simulations and compared them to hi observations .",

    "as would like to thank the anonymous referee for a very constructive report and his comments that helped clarify this paper .",
    "funding for rave has been provided by the anglo - australian observatory , by the astrophysical institute potsdam , by the australian research council , by the german research foundation , by the national institute for astrophysics at padova , by the johns hopkins university , by the netherlands research school for astronomy , by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada , by the slovenian research agency , by the swiss national science foundation , by the national science foundation of the usa ( ast-0508996 ) , by the netherlands organisation for scientific research , by the particle physics and astronomy research council of the uk , by opticon , by strasbourg observatory , and by the universities of basel , cambridge , and groningen .",

    "<S> we present a measure of the inclination of the velocity ellipsoid at 1  kpc below the galactic plane using a sample of red clump giants from the rave dr2 release . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the velocity ellipsoid is tilted towards the galactic plane with an inclination of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we compare this value to computed inclinations for two mass models of the milky way . </S>",
    "<S> we find that our measurement is consistent with a short scale length of the stellar disc ( @xmath1  kpc ) if the dark halo is oblate or with a long scale length ( @xmath2  kpc ) if the dark halo is prolate . </S>",
    "<S> once combined with independent constraints on the flattening of the halo , our measurement suggests that the scale length is approximately halfway between these two extreme values , with a preferred range [ @xmath3-@xmath4  kpc for a nearly spherical halo . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , no model can be clearly ruled out . with the continuation of the rave survey </S>",
    "<S> , it will be possible to provide a strong constraint on the mass distribution of the milky way using refined measurements of the orientation of the velocity ellipsoid .    </S>",
