    "accurate oscillator strengths ( @xmath3-values ) are needed for spectroscopic studies in astronomy .",
    "for instance , they are required when extracting reliable abundances from interstellar absorption lines , when modeling opacities in stellar atmospheres , or when utilizing temperature and density diagnostics .",
    "while analyzing such spectra from space - borne , high - resolution uv spectrographs , one can encounter the problem that uncertainties associated with observational sources are less than those from atomic physics .",
    "this is especially true when the astronomical data have signal - to - noise ratios greater than 100 to 200 .",
    "one can take advantage of the situation by refining @xmath3-values for lines giving discordant results .",
    "the basic premise involves obtaining column densities and doppler parameters from lines where there is consensus on @xmath3-values and then using this information in refining other @xmath3-values .",
    "several recent studies based on interstellar spectra acquired with the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( @xmath5 ) have adopted this methodology .",
    "federman & cardelli ( 1995 ) provided new @xmath3-values for lines of s  i ; many of their determinations were confirmed by subsequent theoretical ( tayal 1998 ) and experimental work ( e.g. , biemont et al .",
    "cardelli & savage ( 1995 ) analyzed fe  ii lines , and zsarg , federman , & cardelli ( 1997 ) refined @xmath3-values for c  i lines with central wavelength below 1200    as well as for some forbidden lines above this limit .",
    "relative @xmath3-values were derived for singly - ionized nickel ( zsarg & federman 1998 ) and singly - ionized cobalt ( mullman et al .",
    "the latter analysis was performed in parallel with laboratory measurements that placed astronomical oscillator strengths on an absolute scale .",
    "laboratory measurements on ni  ii by fedchak , wiese , & lawler ( 2000 ) validated the relative @xmath3-values in our earlier work on singly - ionized nickel .    in the present paper ,",
    "following the method outlined in zsarg et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , we improved upon their @xmath3-values for c  i lines with wavelength below 1200    and expand the number of lines in their list . in section",
    "[ section : obs ] we briefly describe the astronomical measurements available for our analysis , and in section  [ section : model ] we discuss how we obtained column densities and doppler parameters for each absorbing component ( [ subsection : profilesynthesis ] ) and how we adjusted @xmath3-values ( [ subsection : revision ] ) .",
    "finally , we discuss our results in section  [ section : disc ] .",
    "we retrieved observations for @xmath0  ori , 1  sco , and @xmath1  sco from the @xmath5 archive .",
    "most of the measurements were acquired at medium resolution ( mr ) and a handful of them were taken at high resolution ( hr ) .",
    "these spectra covered several c  i multiplets and forbidden lines between 1150     and 1700   .",
    "the reduction was fairly straightforward , and only minor technical problems arose .",
    "the most serious concern was an error in the background correction on some of our preprocessed data .",
    "we detected this error on all of our hr spectra containing the @xmath01261 ( uv9 ) multiplet of c  i. the flux level of strongly saturated lines , such as those of s  ii and si  ii , should be zero at line center ; however , in some cases we measured negative or small positive values , clearly indicating an erroneous background correction",
    ". we could then apply an additional correction to compensate for the effect .",
    "the continuum placement turned out to be difficult for some multiplets , due to blending of several lines or simply because the lines were saturated .",
    "for example , in the vicinity of multiplet @xmath01261 in mr spectra , si  ii and fe  ii lines seriously affected the continuum placement . following line identification and continuum placement , the doppler shift ( relative to the laboratory wavelength ) and equivalent width ( @xmath6 ) of neutral carbon lines",
    "were measured . in some cases",
    ", only upper limits could be calculated based on the average full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the instrumental function and the root mean square ( rms ) average of the noise in the stellar continuum .",
    "we now give a brief description of the available spectra for each of our targets and the data reduction done on them .",
    "we list the measured @xmath6 values together with those calculated from synthetic profiles ( see section  [ subsection : profilesynthesis ] for details on profile synthesis ) and measured in earlier work .",
    "we note that the agreement between our @xmath6 values and those obtained with the @xmath7 satellite ( jenkins & shaya 1979 ; jenkins , jura , & loewenstein 1983 ) is very good .",
    "we retrieved eight observations of @xmath0  ori from the @xmath5 archive ( see table  [ table : obs ] ) , two at high resolution and six at medium .",
    "both hr spectra , z3di0204 t and z3di0205 t , were made with the large science aperture ( lsa ) and so their resolution was slightly lower than usual ( @xmath84 km  s@xmath9 instead of @xmath83 km  s@xmath9 ) .",
    "the only observable c  i lines in the range of hr spectra were those of the multiplets @xmath101157 ( uv16 ) , 1158 ( uv15.01 ) .",
    "there were two additional multiplets covered by the mr observations , @xmath01261 and @xmath01329 ( uv4 ) .",
    "we could measure @xmath6 for all resolved lines ( see table  [ table : loriw ] for measured and calculated values ) .",
    "the two resolved components are separated by @xmath812 km s@xmath9 , as seen in na  i  d spectra ( hobbs 1974 ) .",
    "we retrieved eight measurements of 1  sco from the @xmath5 archive ( table  [ table : obs ] ) , two at high and six at medium resolution .",
    "the hr spectra contained three multiplets , @xmath101194 ( uv9.02 ) and 1329 fully and @xmath01193 ( uv11 ) partially .",
    "multiplet @xmath01329 was very useful for our analysis , since it has very well established oscillator strengths . in mr spectra , we had measurements of all important multiplets with central wavelength between 1200    and 1700    [ @xmath101261 , 1277 ( uv7 ) , 1280 ( uv5 ) , 1329 , 1561 ( uv3 ) , and 1657 ( uv2 ) ] .",
    "the measured and calculated @xmath6 values , together with earlier measurements , are listed in table  [ table:1scow ] .",
    "the two components are separated by about 7 km s@xmath9 and correspond to the strongest components in na  i  d ( welty , hobbs , & kulkarni 1994 ) .",
    "we obtained 7 observations of @xmath1  sco , as listed in table  [ table : obs ] , from the @xmath5 archive .",
    "four of them were high resolution , while the rest were medium resolution .",
    "two of the hr spectra , z3di0504 t and z3di0505 t , were made with the lsa ; hence , their resolution was lower than usual",
    ". we could identify most members of the multiplets @xmath101157 , 1158 in these observations .",
    "the other two hr observations ( z34r020dt and z34r020et ) were of very good quality .",
    "the small science aperture ( ssa ) was utilized ; therefore , they had the maximum possible resolution of the ghrs . both covered multiplet @xmath01261 only , close to the upper wavelength end of the spectra , and the j=2 lines were out of the range of z34r020dt .",
    "we also had three mr spectra containing the full @xmath01261 multiplet .",
    "a combined mr spectrum was created to increase the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the measured and calculated @xmath6 values , together with previous measurements , are given in table  [ table : dscow ] .",
    "the 5 km s@xmath9 separation in components is seen in k  i also ( welty & hobbs 2000 ) and between the two ch@xmath11 components found by crane , lambert , & sheffer ( 1995 ) .",
    "transitions belonging to the same fine structure level can be characterized by the same column density ( @xmath12 ) , doppler or line - broadening parameter ( @xmath4-value ) , and doppler shift .",
    "all the other parameters are independent of the line of sight ( los ) , and are transition specific . in particular , line oscillator strengths , or @xmath3-values ,",
    "are needed .",
    "our task was to specify the number of absorbing components and the corresponding column densities and @xmath4-values for all observable fine stucture levels .",
    "the number of resolved components , which correspond to the strongest features seen in na  i , k  i , and ch@xmath11 spectra , was revealed by visual inspection . there might be , of course , some unresolved ones with separation between them less than the resolution . while slight differences in extracted column densities may result in our approach , the unresolved components could be treated as a single component for all of our modelling purposes .",
    "we had two options to find the column densities and @xmath4-values .",
    "the first , a more traditional and simpler way , is the curve of growth ( cog ) analysis . while it is relatively easy to implement , it is less effective in finding the parameter values , since only the @xmath6 is used and not the entire line profile . also , the cog method is not suitable for analyzing blended lines .",
    "we used this method only to adjust oscillator strengths , whenever it was necessary or possible to do so [ see zsarg et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for details ] .",
    "we used the more complex and accurate method that matches the observed profiles with synthesized ones to find the los - specific parameters .",
    "we calculated the `` observed '' fluxes for all spectra with a given set of column densities , component velocities , and @xmath4-values , and compared them to the corresponding observations .",
    "the set of initial parameters then was adjusted until a satisfactory fit could be achieved .",
    "the final sets of parameters appear in table  [ table : fit ] for our lines of sight . here for simplicity , doppler shifts are relative to the main velocity component which was set at @xmath13 0 km s@xmath9 within iraf , the image reduction and analysis facility from the national optical astronomy observatories .",
    "the slight differences in velocity between fine structure levels ( usually less than @xmath14  0.5  km  s@xmath9 ) for the primary components are small compared to the spectral resolution of @xmath8  3.5  km  s@xmath9 .",
    "the velocities were fixed for the secondary component in each case .",
    "figures  [ fig . 1 ] and [ fig .",
    "2 ] show the observed and synthesized hr spectra of multiplets @xmath101194 and 1329 for 1  sco .",
    "we used the new oscillator strengths for multiplet @xmath01194 to produce the synthesized spectrum .",
    "details of the profile synthesis will be presented in another paper ( zsarg , federman , & welty 2001 ) .",
    "the neutral carbon multiplets and forbidden lines that were used throughout our analysis covered the wavelength range 1150 to 1700   .",
    "every multiplet above 1200    is thought to have well established @xmath3-values .",
    "measurements and calculations have been performed , and a general consensus has been achieved about the values ( see morton 1991 ) . however , for the multiplets with wavelengths below 1200    and for some weak forbidden lines above it , only calculations are available .",
    "the lack of laboratory and precise astronomical measurements make these oscillator strengths less reliable .",
    "the quality of ghrs spectra are generally very good , especially those with high spectral resolution .",
    "this provides a unique opportunity to fill in the gap of missing measurements .",
    "consider the situation where hr spectra of two multiplets for a given los , one with well defined and the other with poorly defined oscillator strengths , are available .",
    "the first multiplet can be used to infer the los information , which is then the basis for refining the @xmath3-values for the second multiplet .",
    "obviously , the more spectra of multiplets with well - defined oscillator strengths we possess , the more precise the adjustment will be .",
    "we adjusted oscillator strengths with a curve of growth analysis .",
    "the adjustment of ill - defined @xmath3-values is accomplished by placing all ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) points on the curve by a @xmath17 analysis . a special algorithm , described in detail by zsarg et al . ( 1997 ) ,",
    "was used to accomplish this goal .",
    "this algorithm allowed us to adjust the @xmath3-values either individually for each line or as a group for members of the same multiplet .",
    "it should be noted that there is danger in such an adjustment .",
    "saturated lines lie on the flat part of the cog , and in such cases , a small uncertainty in @xmath6 can result in a large error in @xmath3-value .",
    "similar errors can occur if the @xmath4-value is ill defined .",
    "this parameter controls where the cog departs from the linear approximation ; therefore , bad @xmath4-values can result in considerable errors in the values of the adjusted oscillator strengths .",
    "it is important to have very reasonable estimates for @xmath4-values and limit this approach for the weaker lines . while we could not quantify the effect of uncertainties in @xmath4-values , it is reassuring that we were able to get self - consistent results with the adjusted @xmath3-values toward multiple lines of sight ( zsarg et al .",
    "in the course of our work here , we found that morton s ( 1991 ) @xmath3-value for @xmath01276 yielded more consistent results than the one given by us ( zsarg et al .",
    "closer inspection of our earlier analysis on @xmath01276 revealed that this line was on the flat portion of the curve of growth for @xmath19  oph  a and @xmath20  oph , and so its @xmath3-value could not be reliably determined from those data .",
    "this supports the inference made by wannier et al .",
    "( 1999 ) from hr spectra of c  i in the envelope of the molecular cloud b5 . [ the other spin - forbidden transistions studied by zsarg et al .",
    "( 1997 ) were weaker and lie on the linear portion of the cog . ]    unfortunately , our analysis of the j=0 lines in the spectrum of @xmath18  sco was based in large measure on @xmath01276 .",
    "if instead we use the multiplets @xmath101261 , 1329 , we obtain a column density of ( 1.0@xmath140.1 ) @xmath21 10@xmath22 @xmath23 and a @xmath4-value of 2.3 km  s@xmath9 .",
    "these parameters lead to significant changes in @xmath3-values for j=0 lines below 1200   .",
    "the results presented in table  [ table : newfvalues ] for j=0 are from the revised analysis . since the j=1 and 2 lines originally were based on @xmath101261 , 1329 , no changes were made to their @xmath3-values .",
    "we adjusted oscillator strengths for several lines and multiplets ; they are displayed in table  [ table : newfvalues ] .",
    "both the new values and others are listed , together with the ratios of the @xmath3-values from morton s ( 1991 ) compilation to our new values .",
    "the estimated uncertainties for the new oscillator strengths are given within parentheses and are based on the uncertainties in @xmath6 and a 10% uncertainty in column density , taken in quadrature .",
    "the uncertainty in column density is mainly the result of continuum placement .",
    "the agreement between the present results for j=0 and those of zsargo et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , as corrected above , is generally very good .",
    "the differences involving lines in multiplet @xmath01157 may be caused by the use of mr spectra in our earlier effort .",
    "the comparison with the recommended values of morton ( 1991 ) for the multiplets @xmath101193 , 1194 is also very good , except for the line at 1193.6  ; the correspondence for lines at shorter wavelengths is less satisfactory . where significant differences are found , they appear to be the result of a breakdown in ls coupling rules for dipole - allowed transitions . the comparison with the theoretical work of hibbert et al .",
    "( 1993 ) shows that the results are very similar .",
    "the agreement with the @xmath3-values given by the compilation of wiese , fuhr , & deters ( 1996 ) is good for lines above 1158.5    in large measure because they adopted the results of hibbert et al .",
    "below this wavelength our results suggest that ls coupling breaks down . for @xmath01193.6 , where a factor - of-2 difference arises in the @xmath3-value of welty et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , it is between ours and morton s ( 1991 ) .",
    "the ratios given in the last column are very useful in assessing whether ls coupling applies or not . since morton ( 1991 ) always assumed ls coupling [ and so did wiese et al .",
    "( 1996 ) below 1180   ] , any variation in the ratio within a multiplet indicates that this approximation does not apply .",
    "the results of using cowan s ( 1981 ) atomic structure code ( zsarg et al . 1997 ) can be used as a guide in describing the breakdown of ls coupling rules . as noted by zsarg et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , configuration interaction ( ci ) is stronger in @xmath01194 ( 5@xmath24 @xmath25 ) than in @xmath01189 ( uv14 ) and there is ci between @xmath01158 ( 6@xmath24 @xmath25 ) and @xmath01156 ( uv19 ) for level j=1 .",
    "another prediction is ci between @xmath01158 and @xmath01156 for j=2 , which we confirm now through observational data .",
    "we also see the predicted spin - orbit ( so ) mixing between 2@xmath26 2@xmath27 6@xmath24 @xmath28 and 2@xmath26 2@xmath27 5@xmath29 @xmath30 ( of @xmath01157 ) .",
    "no other strong effects are seen in @xmath01157 , as predicted .      in the course of a larger study involving c  i excitation ( zsargo et al .",
    "2001 ) , we found that lines below 1200     gave inconsistent column densities and @xmath4-values .",
    "in the present work , we described refinements to the @xmath3-values for these lines so that a self - consistent analysis was possible .",
    "we readjusted the oscillator strengths for some lines in our earlier work ( zsargo et al .",
    "1997 ) to correct for the ( then ) inappropriate choice of @xmath01276 as the basis of our analysis for the j=0 fine - structure level , and we find good agreement between results from the independent data sets . for the few instances where differences are seen , the current @xmath3-values are preferred because they are based on hr spectra .",
    "we also supplemented our inventory of refined @xmath3-values with lines that were not available in our earlier work .",
    "the agreement between our and other recent compilations is generally good .",
    "where disagreements arise , they mainly result from the assumption in other work that ls coupling applies for the multiplets @xmath101157 and 1158 , an approximation not supported by our measurements and analysis .",
