    "in simple terms , what is understood under the sock matching problem @xcite is the following procedure . out of the laundry pile that contains exactly n different pairs of socks socks",
    "are being drawn randomly , one at a time ( so that in the end all the @xmath11 socks would get matched ) . in each move one",
    "tries to find the adequate pair among the drawn socks , in case it had already been obtained in the process .",
    "furthermore , each of the two options : drawing a match to some sock or drawing a sock that has no match as of yet matches a single move , either one unit up or one unit to the right , on a dyck path ( a path in an @xmath9x@xmath9 grid starting from the lower left corner @xmath12 and ending in the upper right corner @xmath13 using merely moves up and to the right without ever crossing the diagonal , see fig .",
    "1a ) - this particular model of the dick paths was used in @xcite ) .",
    "it is a well known fact indeed that the number of all the dick paths of order @xmath9 is equivalent to the @xmath14 catalan number @xmath15 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let us now formulate our sock matching problem in somewhat mathematically stricter terms .",
    "in fact , let us focus upon the total number of ways , labeled by @xmath0 , to get at least @xmath5 unmatched socks at least once during the matching process .",
    "considering the aforementioned interpretation of our problem using dick paths , it is our task to determine which ones out of these @xmath16 possibilities are those that present the paths which hit or pass above the line @xmath17 .",
    "admittedly there is a wide range of interpretations of the catalan numbers @xmath16 .",
    "however , it is that which allows various authors to opt themselves for the most suitable one . here , we make use of the following terminology from @xcite :    * lattice paths , used in @xcite , consider the up- and down - steps .",
    "the former @xmath18-steps represent the case when `` a sock with no match has been drawn '' , whereas the latter @xmath19-steps represent the case when `` a match has been made '' . here , a lattice path goes from @xmath12 to @xmath20 on the cartesian plane without ever moving across the x - axis ( though it is allowed to hit it ) , as shown in fig .",
    "1b ) ; * the number of planted plane trees ( i.e. rooted trees which have been embedded in the plane so that the relative order of subtrees at each branch is part of its structure ; ordered trees ) with @xmath21 nodes , see fig . 2 ; * discrete random walks in a straight line with an absorbing barrier at @xmath22 ( represented by the sequences @xmath23 ; where @xmath24 for @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) ; * the number of all the sequences @xmath1 of nonnegative integers with @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath27 ( problem 6.19 ( @xmath28 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "( note that the value @xmath7 can be interpreted as the exact number of unmatched socks which are present after drawing the @xmath29 sock .",
    "let us note that further on we shell refer to this interpretation as the one with the nonnegative sequences ) .",
    "a bijection is easily established between the sets of the aforementioned combinatorial objects .",
    "for instance , the dyck path shown in fig .",
    "1a ) corresponds to both the path in fig .",
    "1b ) ( which can be obtained by rotating that very figure for @xmath30 and then expanding it with the expansion coefficient of @xmath31 ) as well as to the tree in fig . 2 . to be more precise , by wandering around that tree",
    "the vertical component of successive positions describes a path from @xmath10 ( the root of the tree ) to @xmath22 .",
    "consequently , in this particular example the corresponding discrete random walk would be @xmath32 ; whereas the nonnegative sequence , mentioned in the last interpretation , would be @xmath33 .",
    "the height of a dyck path is the greatest distance from the diagonal to the path , the height of a lattice path the greatest distance from the x - axis to the path , whilst the height of a planted ordered tree is the number of nodes on a maximal simple path starting at a root . clearly , the height of a dyck path is @xmath34 in the nonnegative sequences interpretation , whereas the height of a corresponding planted plane tree is @xmath35 in the discrete random walks interpretation .",
    "now , it is worthwhile realising that the latter value is for one greater than the former . to illustrate this point ,",
    "do have another look at figures 1 and 2 .",
    "there , the height of the presented dyck path ( fig .",
    "1 ) is 2 ( at most 2 unmatched socks appear ) , as opposed to the height of the planted plane tree ( fig .",
    "2 ) which is 3 !    bearing all this in mind ,",
    "the outlined problem from the heading , i.e. the number @xmath0 may represent as follows :    * the number of dyck paths of height at least @xmath5 ( the once that hit or cross the line @xmath17 ) , * the number of lattice paths of height at least @xmath5 ( the ones that hit or cross the line @xmath36 ) , * the number of planted plane trees of height at least @xmath37 , * the number of discrete random walks with @xmath38 , * the number of all the nonnegative sequences containing the letter @xmath5 .",
    "contemporary research related to the dyck paths refer mainly to the number of restricted lattice paths , where the crossing of the x - axis is allowed .",
    "ili ' c and ili in @xcite gave the upper and lower bounds for this number in the form of binomial coefficients .",
    "forging a link between this problem and an older paper @xcite from 1985 .",
    "h. prodinger in @xcite provides an explicit formula for those , as given in this theorem :    the number of random walks from @xmath12 to @xmath20 with up - steps and down - steps of one unit each , under the condition that the path is placed between the lines @xmath39 and @xmath40 is equal to    [ 0 ] _ j 0 .    in a special case , for @xmath41",
    ", we obtain the number of all the sequences @xmath1 of nonnegative integers with @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath27 and @xmath42 @xmath43 .",
    "let us label it by @xmath44 .",
    "obviously , @xmath45 and @xmath46 for @xmath47 , @xmath48 for @xmath49 .",
    "the value @xmath44 was already essentially obtained in @xcite in the distant 1972 . in the form of trigonometric functions .",
    "the authors of that paper used the rooted tree ( planted plane tree ) interpretation .",
    "as for convenience , we reformulate their results in the following theorem .    [ 2 ] a_n , t = _ 1 j 4^n+1 ^2 ( ) ^2n ( ) , n 1    it is quite an interesting fact that this formula has been rediscovered many a times , which the authors of the paper @xcite clearly point out , and that above all lagrange derived a formula in 1775 . which essentially includes this as a special case .",
    "the authors of the paper @xcite derive a recurrence formula for the numbers @xmath0 to which they refer as the so - called _ sock matching theorem_. however , we noticed that an omission was made in the proof of it having written `` the first point '' instead of `` the last point '' whilst defining the point @xmath50 .",
    "additionally , the index of summation should go from @xmath51 to @xmath52 , and not from @xmath53 to @xmath54 .",
    "further , having found the results from the included table 1 . to be correct , it is pretty clear that the paper must have contained a few typos . for the purpose of providing a valid formula for @xmath0 , with the accompanying proofs , we shell present two equivalent alternatives in section 2 , using more than just the mentioned author s idea . in section 3",
    "we give an explicit expression for @xmath0 .    in @xcite a proposition was made that the probability @xmath55 for the dyck path to reach the line @xmath17 approaches @xmath10 as the number @xmath9 becomes large enough , i.e. @xmath56 .",
    "however , in the proof they make use of the equation @xmath57 which indirectly implies that they considered @xmath58 to be valid , where the probability @xmath59 of reaching @xmath36 in the @xmath29 section is at least @xmath60 .",
    "that , nevertheless , is incorrect ( for a counter - example can easily be obtained ) . in section 4",
    "we provide an accurate proof of this proposition .",
    "( the sock matching theorem - i alternative )    the sequence @xmath0 whose @xmath14 term represents the number of dyck paths of order @xmath9 which hit or cross the line @xmath61 is determined by the following recurrence formula : [ 2.1 ] b_n , k = _",
    "i=1^n ( b_i-1,k-1c_n - i + c_i-1b_n - i , k - b_i-1,k-1b_n - i , k ) .",
    "( the first one )    let @xmath50 be the first point on the line @xmath62 which the dyck path visits after @xmath12 .",
    "further , we take three possibilities into consideration : the line hits @xmath17 before @xmath50 ( case 1 ) , the line hits @xmath17 after @xmath50 ( case 2 ) , and the line hits @xmath17 both before and after @xmath50 ( case 3 ) .    the number of paths in the first case is @xmath63 .",
    "namely , the number of ways to hit @xmath17 between @xmath12 and @xmath50 without hitting @xmath62 is the same as the number of ways to get from @xmath64 to @xmath65 hitting @xmath17 but not crossing @xmath66 , which is @xmath67 and the number of ways to get from @xmath50 to @xmath13 without crossing @xmath62 is @xmath68",
    ".    similarly , the numbers in the second and third case are @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "( the second one )    there is , however , yet another approach which may be taken in order to obtain the formula ( [ 2.1 ] ) which makes use of the recurrence relation satisfied by the numbers @xmath71 derived in @xcite : [ 2.3 ] a_n , k+1 = a_n-1,k+1a_0,k + a_n-2,k+1a_1,k+ ",
    "+ a_0,k+1a_n-1,k , n 1 , k 0 ; with the initial conditions for @xmath72 and for @xmath73 . to be more specific , as [ 2.4 ]",
    "b_n , k = c_n - a_n , k-1 , n 1 k1 ( evidently , @xmath74 ) making the necessary substitutions in ( [ 2.3])and with the use of the well - known recurrence relation for catalan numbers ( @xmath75 ) we obtain the desired relation .    (",

    "j=0^n-1 ( b_j , kc_n - j-1 + c_jb_n - j-1,k-1 - b_j , kb_n - j-1,k-1 ) .    similarly to the previous alternative we take the point @xmath50 into consideration , only this time as the last point on the line @xmath62 that the dyck path visits before @xmath13 . seen from this perspective",
    ", the corresponding numbers for the three cases would be exactly the values @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .    by the way ,",
    "the proof for the second formula ( [ 2.2 ] ) could , obviously , be obtain from ( [ 2.1 ] ) by a fairly simple substitution : @xmath79 .",
    "we now give the explicit expression for the values of @xmath0 .    [ 2.6 ] b_n , k= _ j = 1^ 2 n + 2 n + 1 - j ( k + 1 ) -4 _ j = 1^ 2 n n - j ( k + 1 )    ( the first one ) recall that the value @xmath44 for the lower bound @xmath41 is known from ( [ 0 ] ) .",
    "further , setting the upper bound to be @xmath80 it follows directly from ( [ 2.4 ] ) that [ 2.5 ] b_n , k = - _ j 0    after some minor algebraic simplifications of the above expression we have [ 2.11]b_n , k = _ j 1 ,    which coincides with the formula presented in @xcite for the number of planted plane trees with @xmath21 nodes whose height is grater than @xmath5 .",
    "now , since @xmath81 the expression ( [ 2.6 ] ) is easily derivable from ( [ 2.11 ] ) .",

    "we obtain the following [ 2.8 ] a_n , t = ( _ 1 j ^2n ( ) - _ 1 j ^2n+2 ( ) ) , n 1 .further , using one of the notations for the representation of trigonometric power sums , namely the one with binomial coefficients , from @xcite , we have [ 2.9]_j=0^n-1 ^2 m",
