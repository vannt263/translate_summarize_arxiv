    "grbs are the farthest sources , seen up to redshift @xmath1 @xcite , and if emitting isotropically they are also the most powerful , ( with @xmath2 erg s@xmath3 ) , objects in the universe . in spite of the great diversity of their prompt emission lightcurves and their broad range spanning over 7 orders of magnitude of @xmath4 ,",
    "some common features have been identified from investigation of their afterglow light curves . a crucial breakthrough in this field",
    "has been the observation of grbs by the _ swift _ satellite which provides a rapid follow - up of the afterglows in several wavelengths revealing a more complex behavior of the x - ray lightcurves than a broken power law generally observed before @xcite .",
    "the _ swift _ afterglow lightcurves manifest several segments .",
    "the second segment , when it is flat , is called the plateau emission . a significant step forward in determining common features in the afterglow lightcurves was made by fitting them with an analytical expression @xcite , called hereafter w07 .",
    "this provides the opportunity to look for universal features that could provide a redshift independent measure of the distance , as in studies of correlations between grb isotropic energy and peak photon energy of the @xmath5 spectrum , @xmath6-@xmath7 , @xcite , the beamed total energy @xmath8-@xmath7 @xcite , @xmath9-@xmath10 luminosity - variability , @xcite , @xmath9-@xmath7 @xcite and possibly others @xcite .",
    "impacts of detector thresholds on cosmological standard candles have also been considered @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , because of large dispersion @xcite and absence of good calibration none of these correlations allow the use of grbs as ` standard candles ' as has been done e.g. with type ia supernovae .",
    "dainotti et al .",
    "( 2008 , 2010 ) , using the w07 phenomenological law for the lightcurves of long grbs , discovered a formal anti - correlation between the x - ray luminosity at the end of the plateau @xmath11 and the rest frame plateau end- time , @xmath12 , ( hereafter lt ) , described as :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is in seconds and @xmath11 is in erg / s .",
    "the normalization and the slope parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 are constants obtained by the dagostini fitting method @xcite .",
    "dainotti et al .",
    "2011a attempted to use the lt correlation as possible redshift estimator , but the paucity of the data and the scatter prevents from a definite conclusion at least for a sample of 62 grbs .",
    "in addition , a further step to better understand the role of the plateau emission has been made with the discovery of new significant correlations between @xmath11 , and the mean luminosities of the prompt emission , @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the lt anticorrelation is also a useful test for theoretical models such as the accretion models , @xcite , the magnetar models @xcite , the prior emission model @xcite , the unified grb and agn model @xcite and the fireshell model @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been recovered within also other observational correlations @xcite .",
    "finally , it has been applied as a cosmological tool @xcite . here , we study an updated sample of 101 grbs and we investigate whether the lt correlation is intrinsic or induced by cosmological evolution of @xmath11 and @xmath14 , and/or observational biases due to the instrumental threshold .",
    "this step is necessary to cast light on the nature of the plateau emission , to provide further constraints on the theoretical models , and possibly to assess the use of the lt correlation as a model discriminator . in section [ data ]",
    "we describe the data and the results from correlation test carried using the data . in section [ intrinsic correlations ]",
    "we use the ep method to determine the correlation between @xmath11 and @xmath18 . in section [ density and luminosity ] the cumulative density and luminosity",
    "are defined and derived .",
    "this is followed by a discussion section .",
    "we have analyzed the sample of all grb x - ray afterglows with known redshifts detected by _",
    "swift _ from january 2005 up to may 2011 , for which the light curves include early x - ray data and therefore can be fitted by the w07 model .",
    "willingale proposed a functional form for @xmath19 :    @xmath20    for both the prompt ( the index ` i=_p _ ' ) @xmath21-ray and initial x -ray decay and for the afterglow (  i=__a _ _ \" ) modeled so that the complete lightcurve @xmath22 contains two sets of four parameters @xmath23 .",
    "the transition from the exponential to the power law occurs at the point @xmath24 where the two functional sections have the same value and gradient .",
    "the parameter @xmath25 is the temporal power law decay index and the time @xmath26 is the initial rise timescale .    in previous papers w07 , dainotti et al .",
    "( 2008,2010 ) fitted the _ swift _",
    "burst alert telescope ( bat)+ x - ray telescope ( xrt ) lightcurves of grbs were fitted to eq .",
    "( [ eq : fc ] ) assuming that the rise time of the afterglow started at the time of the beginning of the decay phase of the prompt emission , @xmath27 , namely @xmath28 . in this paper , we search for an independent measure of the parameters of the afterglow , thus we leave @xmath29 to be a free parameter . in the majority of the cases we have @xmath30 .",
    "we use the redshifts available in the literature @xcite , in greiner web page http://www.mpe.mpg.de/  jcg / grbgen.html , and in the circulars notice arxive ( gcn ) .",
    "( we exclude grbs with uncertain redshift measurement . )",
    "the complete set of grbs with definite known redshift till may 2011 is @xmath31 , but not all grbs show a well defined plateau emission . * the fitting procedure fails either when it gives unreasonable values , or when the determination of confidence interval in 1 @xmath32 does nt fulfill the avni 1976 prescriptions , for more details see http://heasarc.nasa.gov/xanadu/xspec/manual/xspecspectralfitting.html .",
    "the latter prescriptions require for a proper evaluation of the error bars the computation in the 1 @xmath32 confidence interval for every parameter varying the parameter value until the @xmath33 increases by @xmath34 above the minimum ( or the best - fit ) value , because we are in a tree - parameter space .",
    "these rules define the amount that the @xmath33 is allowed to increase , which depends on the confidence level one requires , and on the number of parameters whose confidence space is being calculated .",
    "*    the source rest - frame luminosity in the _ swift _ xrt bandpass , @xmath35 kev at time @xmath36 , is computed from the equation :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the grb luminosity distance , cdm flat cosmological model with @xmath39 and @xmath40 @xmath41 is the measured x - ray energy flux and @xmath42 is the so called _",
    "k_-correction for x - ray power law index @xmath43 @xcite .    *",
    "the error bars on the normalization parameter and the slope quoted of the @xmath11 and @xmath18 are computed with the method of dagostini ( 2005 ) , which is a suitable method where the errors on both variables are comparable ( which is the case here ) and it is not possible to decide which one is the independent variable to be used in the @xmath33 fitting analysis .",
    "moreover , the relation @xmath44 may be affected by an intrinsic scatter @xmath45 of unknown nature that has to be taken into account .",
    "thus , to determine the parameters @xmath46 , we follow the @xcite bayesian approach and maximize the likelihood function @xmath47}$ ] where : *    @xmath48    @xmath49 and the sum is over the @xmath50 objects in the sample .",
    "note that , actually , this maximization is performed in the two parameter space @xmath51 since @xmath15 may be estimated analytically as :    @xmath52 \\left [ \\sum{\\frac{1}{\\sigma_{int}^2 + \\sigma_{y_i}^2 + b^2 \\sigma_{x_i}^2 } } \\right ] ^{-1 } \\label{eq : calca}\\ ] ]    so that we will not consider it anymore as a fit parameter .",
    "initially , we had a sample of 116 grbs with firm redshift including 11 ic , and with the evaluation of the observables @xmath36 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 but not for all of them we were able to fulfill the avni prescriptions mentioned above . among the 116 grbs , 104 had the proper evaluation of the error measurements , but 3 of them had an error energy parameter @xmath55 , ( for definition about this parameter and its use , see dainotti et al .",
    "2011b ) therefore we discarded , because such values of the errors have no physical meaning .",
    "we thus have a sample of 101 grbs .",
    "to ensure that the inclusion of the ic does not introduce biases in the evaluation of the power slope for the @xmath11-@xmath56 correlation for long grbs , we checked the slopes of the sample with and without the 8 ic bursts .",
    "the two power slopes are compatible within 1 @xmath32 .",
    "we pointed out that in a previous paper @xcite we did not introduce the ic bursts because these represented more than @xmath57 of the sample , while in the current sample they represents only @xmath58 . for the whole sample without the ic we found the power law slope @xmath59 , while for the whole sample @xmath60 .",
    "the spearman correlation coefficient for the larger sample ( @xmath61 ) is higher than @xmath62 obtained for a subsample of 66 long duration grbs analyzed in dainotti et al .",
    "the probability of the correlation ( of the 101 long grbs ) occurring by chance within an uncorrelated sample is @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] , left panel , shows the @xmath11-@xmath56 distribution of 101 grbs with @xmath64 and includes afterglows of 93 long and 8 short bursts with extended emission @xcite , called the intermediate class ( ic ) , see table 1    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     however , as mentioned above , because both @xmath11 and @xmath56 depend on redshift ( @xmath11 increasing and @xmath56 decresing with @xmath65 ) and the sample covers a broad redshift range all or part of the anticorrelation might be induced by these dependencies .",
    "it is therefore important to determine the extent of this effect and determine the true or intrinsic correlation .",
    "in addition any cosmological evolution in @xmath11 and/or @xmath56 will affect the degree of the observed anti - correlation .",
    "* fig.[fig1 ] , central panel , shows the colour coded fitted lines .",
    "the distribution of the subsamples presents different power law slopes when we divide the whole sample into 5 redshift bins ( see dainotti et al .",

    "however , in all cases these differences are all less then @xmath83 . we expect the correlation slope be closer to the one of the subsamples than the whole sample , because each subsample has a smaller redshift range @xmath84 , which decreases the effect of the redshift dependence and/or redshift evolution .",
    "in addition , this test disfavors a strong redshift evolution in the correlation . in the next section",
    "we give a more quantitative analysis of these results with the efron & petrosian ( ep ) method @xcite which is able to determine the intrinsic correlation among variables in a truncated bivariate distribution .",
    "the first important step for determining the distribution of true correlations among the variables is quantification of the biases introduced by the observational and sample selection effects . in the case under study the selection effect or bias that distorts the statistical correlations are the flux limit and the temporal resolution of the instrument . to account for these effects",
    "we apply the efron & petrosian technique , already successfully applied for grbs @xcite .",
    "other methodologies to treat selection biases have also been investigated @xcite .    *",
    "the ep method reveals the intrinsic correlation because the method is specifically designed to overcome the biases resulting from incomplete data .",
    "moreover , it identifies and removes also the redshift evolution present in both variables , time and luminosity . *",
    "the ep method uses a modified version of the kendall @xmath77 statistic to test the independence of variables in a truncated data .",
    "instead of calculating the ranks @xmath85 of each data points among all observed objects , which is normally done for an untruncated data , the rank of each data point is determined among its  associated sets \" which include all objects that could have been observed given the observational limits .",
    "a full discussion of the method is provided in the literature @xcite and references cited therein .    * here we give a brief summary of the algebra involved in the ep method .",
    "this method uses the kendall rank test to determine the best - fit values of parameters describing the correlation functions using the test statistic *    @xmath86    to determine the independence of two variables in a data set , say ( @xmath87 ) for @xmath88 . here",

    "if ( @xmath87 ) were independent then the rank @xmath94 should be distributed continuously between 0 and 1 with the expectation value @xmath95 and variance @xmath96 .",
    "independence is rejected at the @xmath97 level if @xmath98 . here",
    "the mean and variance are calculated separately for each associated set and summed accordingly to produce a single value for @xmath77 .",
    "this parameter represents the degree of correlation for the entire sample with proper accounting for the data truncation .    with this statistic",
    ", we find the parametrization that best describes the luminosity and time evolution .",
    "this means that we have to determine the limiting flux , @xmath99 , which gives the minimum observed luminosity for a given redshift , @xmath100 as shown in fig .",
    "the nominal limiting sensitivity of xrt , @xmath101 erg @xmath72 @xmath102 , is too low to describe the truncation of our sample , dashed line .",
    "this is because there is a limit in the plateau end times , @xmath103 s , right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . therefore , as pointed out by cannizzo et al .",
    "2011 this restriction increases the flux threshold to @xmath104 erg @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , taking into account the above minimum plateau end time we have investigated several limiting fluxes to determine a good representative value while keeping an adequate size of the sample .",
    "we have chosen the limiting flux @xmath10510@xmath106 erg @xmath72 , shown by the red solid line , which allows 90 grbs in the sample .",
    "the first step required for this kind of investigation is the determination of whether the variables @xmath11 and @xmath56 , are correlated with redshift or are statistically independent of it .",
    "for example , the correlation between @xmath11 and the redshift , @xmath65 , is what we call luminosity evolution , and independence of these variables would imply absence of such evolution .",
    "the ep method prescribed how to remove the correlation by defining new and independent variables .",
