    "the black - scholes ( b - s ) @xcite @xcite pricing formula for call options is widely used by market agents .",
    "however , rather than as a predictive formula , it is used as a means of quoting option prices in terms of another parameter , the implied volatility . if @xmath0 is the black - scholes price for an option at time @xmath1 , with strike price @xmath2 , maturity time @xmath3 and underlying price @xmath4 then , the implied volatility @xmath5 is such that @xmath6 @xmath7 being the market price of a ( liquid ) option .",
    "b - s is based on unrealistic assumptions about the market process : geometric brownian motion with constant non - stochastic volatility , continuous adjustment of the portfolio and no transaction fees . nevertheless b - s owes its great popularity to its simplicity and to the fact that @xmath8 is an invertible map from @xmath9 to @xmath10 , @xmath11 being the risk - free rate .    the empirical shortcomings of b - s originated a vast amount of alternative models @xcite @xmath12 @xcite , which attempt to explain the deviations from b - s by introducing additional degrees of freedom .",
    "the majority of these models have no compact closed - form solution and numerical solutions most often do not reproduce correctly the data profiles @xcite @xcite .",
    "given the success of the black - scholes formula as a compact invertible parametrization , any alternative model that attempts to introduce a higher degree of market realism should , at least , provide also a compact closed - form recipe to parametrize the data .    in liquid markets the autocorrelation of price changes decays to negligible quantities in a few minutes ,",
    "consistent with the absence of long term statistical arbitrage .",
    "geometric brownian motion models well this lack of memory , although it does not reproduce the empirical leptokurtosis . on the other hand , nonlinear functions of the returns exhibit significant positive autocorrelation . for example , there is volatility clustering , with large returns expected to be followed by large returns and small returns by small returns ( of either sign ) .",
    "this has the clear implication that , on stochastic volatility models , long memory effects should be represented in the volatility process .",
    "two - factor models with one persistent factor and one quickly mean - reverting factor @xcite , multicomponent garch models as the one proposed in @xcite ( lm(q)-arch ) or fractionally integrated processes @xcite @xcite provide adequate fits to the empirical volatility data .",
    "however , these models do not possess the analytical properties required to construct an option pricing equation generalizing black - scholes .    because the market process , as well as some functionals of their variables , display approximate self - similar properties , mathematical simplicity suggests to look for descriptions in terms of fractional brownian motion .",
    "in fact , if a nondegenerate process @xmath13 has finite variance , stationary increments and is self - similar @xmath14 then @xcite @xmath15 and @xmath16 the simplest process with these properties is a gaussian process called fractional brownian motion .",
    "fractional brownian motion @xcite @xmath17 = 0\\qquad \\bbb{e}\\left [ b_{h}\\left ( t\\right ) b_{h}\\left ( s\\right ) \\right ] = \\frac{1}{2}\\left\\ { \\left| t\\right| ^{2h}+\\left| s\\right| ^{2h}-\\left| t - s\\right| ^{2h}\\right\\ } \\label{1.1}\\ ] ] has for @xmath18 a long range dependence @xmath19 and was suggested in the past as a tool for modeling in finance @xcite . however , because it was pointed out @xcite that markets based on @xmath20 could have arbitrage , fractional brownian motion was no longer considered , by many , as promising for mathematical modeling in finance . the arbitrage result in @xcite",
    "is a consequence of using pathwise integration . with a different definition @xcite , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a partition of the interval @xmath23 $ ]",
    ", @xmath24 and @xmath25 denotes the wick product , the integral has zero expectation value and the arbitrage result is no longer true .",
    "this is , in fact , the most natural definition because it is the wick product that is associated to integrals of it type , whereas the usual product is natural for integrals of stratonovich type .",
    "an essentially equivalent approach constructs the stochastic integral through the divergence operator and malliavin calculus @xcite . a fully consistent stochastic calculus has therefore been developed for fractional brownian motion @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "we will draw on these results , in particular on the fractional generalization of the it formula , to derive our stochastic differential market model and option pricing equation .    however , to simply postulate that the price process follows a stochastic law @xmath26 with @xmath20 ( @xmath27 ) a persistent fractional brownian motion , as done in @xcite @xcite , although mathematically pleasant , is not phenomenological correct in view of the fact that price changes have a short memory .",
    "the simplest alternative would be to generalize current stochastic volatility models by changing the hurst coefficient of the volatility process , namely @xmath28 the price would follow a geometrical brownian process , whereas the volatility would have a mean - reverting deterministic term and a stochastic component modeled by a geometrical fractional brownian motion of hurst coefficient @xmath18 .",
    "this , on the one hand , would introduce a memory component on the volatility ( where the data says it should be ) and , on the other hand , as it is known @xcite @xcite stochastic volatility changes the effective probability distribution function of @xmath29 ( even for @xmath30 ) , generating fat tails closer to the empirical data .",
    "however , the stochastic volatility model of eqs.([1.5 ] ) , as we will see later , turns out not to be justified as well , because its scaling properties are very different from those of the empirical data . for this reason we have made a detailed analysis of the data , reported in section 2 , trying to infer a model which is , at the same time , mathematically manageable and not grossly disproved by the data .",
    "our conclusion is the following coupled stochastic system @xmath31 it means that , in addition to a mean value , volatility is driven not by fractional brownian motion but by fractional noise .",
    "notice that our empirically based model is quite different from the usual stochastic volatility models which assume the volatility to follow an arithmetic or geometric brownian process .",
    "@xmath32 is the observation scale of the process . in the @xmath33 limit",
    "the driving process would be the distribution - valued process @xmath34@xmath35 in ( [ 1.6 ] ) the constant @xmath36 measures the strength of the volatility randomness .",
    "although phenomenologically grounded and mathematically well specified , the stochastic system ( [ 1.6 ] ) is still a limited model because , in particular , the fact that the volatility is not correlated with the price process excludes the modeling of leverage effects .    in section 3 , following a risk - neutrality approach @xcite @xcite , we use the conditional probability distributions following from eqs.([1.6 ] ) to derive an option price formula and compare it with black - scholes , namely in terms of the equivalent implied volatility surfaces .",
    "the risk - neutrality approach of section 3 provides a fairly simple explicit generalization of black - scholes , which we believe to be based in a more realistic mathematical representation of the market process .",
    "nevertheless it relies on some approximations which may or may not be justified .",
    "therefore , for future reference , we derive in section 4 an option pricing equation of wider generality and obtain an integral representation of its solution .",
    "option pricing being our primary motivation , the relevant time scales and temporal horizon is greater than one day .",
    "therefore we will use daily data from the new york stock exchange ( nyse ) , the aggregate index and individual companies as well . to discount trend effects and approach asymptotic stationarity of the processes , we have detrended and rescaled the data as explained in ref.@xcite .",
    "the first objective is to check whether the assumption that the price process follows a geometric brownian process @xmath37 is an acceptable hypothesis for the daily data . for detrended data @xmath38 and if the stochastic part is a self - similar process it should satisfy @xmath39    in the lower left panel of fig.1 one checks eq.([2.2 ] ) for the nyse index in the period 1966@xmath122000 with @xmath40 days .",
    "we obtain approximate linearity in the log - log plot with @xmath41 .",
    "there is a small deviation from linearity for the first few days , but one should notice that stochastic volatility effects have not yet been taken into account .",
    "so , the geometric brownian hypothesis for the daily price process is , at least , not very unreasonable .",
    "it would imply that , in first approximation , the probability distribution would be log - normal with volatility ( variance ) given by @xmath42 eq.([2.3 ] ) is used to extract the volatility process @xmath43 from the data and one checks whether a relation of the form @xmath44 or @xmath45 hold for the volatility process .",
    "this would be the behavior implied by most of the stochastic volatility models that have been proposed in the past .",
    "it turns out that the data shows this to be a very bad hypothesis , meaning that the volatility process itself is not self - similar .",
    "however , the integrated log - volatility is well represented by a relation of the form @xmath46 as shown in the lower right panel of fig.1 the @xmath47 process has self - similar properties .",
    "we will identify it with a fractional brownian motion with hurst coefficient @xmath48 ( for the nyse index ) , @xmath49 the same parametrization holds for the data of all individual companies that we tested , with @xmath50 in the range @xmath51 .",
    "this analysis bears some resemblance to the detrended fluctuation analysis technique @xcite .",
    "notice however that here , because we are using market data that has already been detrended and rescaled , it is used merely to extract the mean volatility .",
    "eq.([2.6 ] ) provides a simple mathematical representation of the volatility memory effects .",
    "in particular , it means that the volatility is not driven by fractional brownian motion but by fractional noise , @xmath52 @xmath32 being the observation time scale ( one day , for daily data ) .",
    "this provides a simple interpretation of the fact that empirical return statistics depend on the observation time scale . in the @xmath53 limit ( continuous time resolution )",
    "the driving process would be the distribution valued process ( fractional white noise ) @xmath54 for the volatility ( at resolution @xmath32 ) @xmath55 the term @xmath56 being included to insure that @xmath57 .",
    "( [ 2.1 ] ) and ( [ 2.7 ] ) , or equivalently ( [ 2.1 ] ) and ( [ 2.9 ] ) , define our stochastic volatility model .",
    "this stochastic volatility model will be used in the next section to derive an option pricing formula .",
    "however it is also useful to compute the modifications implied by the stochastic volatility on the probability distribution of the price returns . from ( [ 2.7 ] ) one concludes that @xmath58 is a gaussian process with mean @xmath59 and covariance @xmath60 this gaussian process has non - trivial correlation for @xmath61 . at each fixed time @xmath62",
    "is a gaussian random variable with mean @xmath59 and variance @xmath63 .",
    "then , @xmath64 therefore    @xmath65    with @xmath66 one sees that the effective probability distribution of the returns depends on the observation time scale @xmath32 .",
    "this is a pleasant feature of this stochastic volatility model , which contrasts , for example , with garchmodels which describe well the volatility at a given time resolution , but fail to account for the @xmath32 dependence .",
    "assuming risk neutrality @xcite , the value @xmath67 of an option must be the present value of the expected terminal value discounted at the risk - free rate @xmath68 @xmath69 $ ] and the conditional probability for the terminal price depends on @xmath29 and @xmath70 . as in hull and white @xcite , we make use of the relation between conditional probabilities of related variables , namely @xmath71 @xmath72 being the random variable @xmath73 then eq.([3.1 ] ) becomes @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76 being the black - scholes price for an option with average volatility @xmath77 , which is known to be @xmath78 with @xmath79 and @xmath80    to compute the conditional probability @xmath81 we recall that from our stochastic volatility model @xmath82 notice that , because we want to compute the conditional probability of @xmath83 given @xmath62 at time @xmath1 , @xmath43 in eq.([3.9 ] ) is not a process but simply the value of the argument in the @xmath84 function .    as a @xmath85dependence process",
    "the double integral in ( [ 3.9 ] ) is a centered gaussian process .",
    "therefore , given @xmath62 at time @xmath1 , @xmath83 is a gaussian variable with conditional mean and variance @xmath86 @xmath87 with @xmath88 @xmath89 because in general @xmath90 one obtains @xmath91 finally @xmath92 and from ( [ 3.4 ] ) @xmath93 one obtains @xmath94 -ke^{-r\\left ( t - t\\right ) } \\left [ am\\left ( \\alpha , a ,- b\\right ) -bm\\left",
    "( \\alpha , -b , a\\right ) \\right ] \\label{3.16}\\ ] ] @xmath95 as the new option price formula ( @xmath96c being the complementary error function and @xmath97 and @xmath98 being defined in eq.([3.7 ] ) ) , with @xmath99 replaced by @xmath43 .",
    "in fig.2 we plot the option value surface for @xmath67 in the range @xmath100 $ ] and @xmath101 $ ] as well as the difference @xmath102 for @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "the other parameters are fixed at @xmath105 .",
    "the lower right panel shows the implied volatility surface corresponding to @xmath106 for @xmath103 .",
    "notice that computationally it is perhaps more convenient to use eq.([3.15 ] ) ( and an optimized black - scholes routine ) than the more elegant eq.([3.16 ] ) .",
    "whenever the actual drift of a financial time series can be replaced by the risk - free rate we are in a risk - neutral situation . however , in stochastic volatility models this may not be a good assumption . in particular , an accurate option pricing formula should take into account the market price of volatility risk . here",
    "we derive an option pricing equation which does not assume risk - neutrality .",
    "because volatility is not a tradable security , a pure arbitrage argument can not determine completely the fair price of an option .",
    "on the other hand , because of the fractional nature of the volatility process , volatility follows a stochastic process different from the one of the underlying security .",
    "therefore , we can not apply the reasoning @xcite that leads to uniform coefficients of the form @xmath107 in the first derivative terms of the option pricing equation , @xmath108 and @xmath109 would be the drift , volatility and market price of risk for each process ] .",
    "hence , a first principles derivation , with clearly specified assumptions is required .    as in black - scholes",
    ", we form a portfolio @xmath110 from ( [ 2.1 ] ) and ( [ 2.7 ] ) and choosing @xmath111 we obtain @xmath112 consistent with our stochastic volatility model ( [ 1.6 ] ) , we have assumed the volatility to be uncorrelated with @xmath113 and eq.([4.2 ] ) follows from the application of the fractional it formula @xcite @xcite .",
    "namely , if @xmath114 with @xmath115 , then @xmath116 @xmath117 being the @xmath118malliavin derivative corresponding to the @xmath119process , defined by @xmath120 @xmath121 being the kernel @xmath122    in ( [ 4.2 ] ) we are still left with the stochastic term @xmath123 and , because volatility is not a tradable security this term can not be eliminated by a portfolio choice .",
    "instead we may assume as reasonable to equate the deterministic term in @xmath124 to @xmath125 where @xmath11 is the risk - free return and , with @xmath126 , the second term is a measure of the market price of volatility risk ( bigger risk , bigger return ) .",
    "we end up with @xmath127 as the general form of the option pricing equation consistent with the stochastic volatility model in ( [ 1.6 ] ) .",
    "now , defining new constants @xmath131 and making the replacement @xmath132 eq.([4.11 ] ) reduces to a standard bessel equation .",
    "therefore the solution of ( [ 4.8 ] ) is @xmath133 @xmath134 being a bessel function .",
    "the bessel function will be a linear combination @xmath135 of a bessel function of first kind and a neumann function , with coefficients @xmath136 and @xmath137 to be fixed by the boundary conditions , which for call options is @xmath138"
