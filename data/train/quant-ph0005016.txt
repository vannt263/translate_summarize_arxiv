[ 1 ] is approximate since in quantum mechanics one should multiply amplitudes but not probabilities , nevertheless the form ( [ 1 ] ) accounts necessary physical feature .",
    "suppose a tunneling particle is acted by some electric field @xmath12 ( periodic or pulse - type ) and the typical time scale of this signal is @xmath13 . than one can distinguish two different physical situations : ( i ) _ hard signal _ , fast varying field with @xmath14 and ( ii ) _ soft signal _ , slow varying field with @xmath15 .",
    "tunneling can be governed easily by a hard signal even when its amplitude is less than the static barrier field @xmath16 , since the probability of quantum absorption @xmath17 competes , according to eq .  [ 1 ] , with the small tunneling rate ( in this case @xmath18 ) .",
    "it is also obvious that a soft signal of the high amplitude @xmath16 ( static field of the barrier ) is able to govern tunneling .",

    "this is an indication of efficiency of soft signals .",
    "breaking of the perturbation theory means a significance of multi - quantum processes and a principal question is that what theory has to be used in this case .",
    "a review of some aspects of tunneling in complex systems , including the instanton approach , was done in the book @xcite , see also ref .",

    "the goal of this work is to show that the semiclassical theory based on the concept of the complex time is an appropriate description of tunneling under action of a soft pulse of any shape .",
    "for the particular case of a triangular barrier the tunneling rate in presence of a non - stationary ( soft ) field is found to be determined , in the main exponential approximation , by the classical action @xmath23 satisfying the hamilton - jacobi equation . in this approximation",
    "the wave function is proportional to @xmath24 ( below planck s constant is unity ) .",
    "the first correction ( preexponential ) to this classical result and the second one were found explicitly and shown to be small comparing to the main contribution , what is typical for semiclassical approximation .",

    "the classical trajectory obeys newton s equation @xmath27 in the complex time , since in the real time there is no classical under - barrier path .",
    "so , the method of classical trajectories in the complex time can be used , when the full time dependence of the tunneling rate is not required , but only its maximum value with an exponential accuracy is a matter of interest .",

    "the parameter @xmath35 depends on properties of the static barrier and the particle energy @xcite , but @xmath13 is a characteristic of a non - stationary signal .",
    "the physical meaning of the condition ( [ 3 ] ) is not straightforward since a quantum mechanical process is described by a product of amplitudes but not of probabilities .",

    "if the minimization condition ( [ 72 ] ) violates the particle energy @xmath31 would acquire an imaginary part . in summary of this section , in case of small non - stationary field @xmath12 one can use the perturbation approach ( [ 71 ] ) with the further minimization ( [ 73 ] ) .",
    "we consider the potential barrier @xmath251 the classical unperturbed trajectory satisfies the relations @xcite @xmath252 and is an analytical function of the complex variable @xmath28 having the branch points at @xmath253 where @xmath254 close to the branch point @xmath255 the trajectory has the form @xmath256 the cut is shown in fig.3 by the dashed horizontal line . now",
    "the integral , defining @xmath257 in eq .",
    "[ 71 ] , can be calculated on base of analytical properties .",
    "let us choose the non - stationary pulse in the form ( [ 2 ] ) with @xmath258 and the potential barrier ( [ 74 ] ) .",
    "then the integrand in eq .",
    "[ 71 ] has singularities of two types in the complex @xmath28-plane : @xmath255 comes from the analytical function @xmath259 and @xmath260 comes from the analytical function @xmath12 .",
    "there are different positions of the contour @xmath170 with respect to those singular points giving rise to different branches of the extreme action .",
    "the branch , giving the minimum value of @xmath186 , results from the position shown in fig.3 , when the contour @xmath170 goes between the two singularities .",
    "this very branch determines the effect .",
    "we consider here only the case @xmath261 .",
    "the contour @xmath170 can be deformed up and in the limit @xmath262 the pole circle at @xmath33 gives the main contribution @xmath263 according to eq .",
    "[ 76 ] , @xmath255 depends on @xmath244 and the minimization ( [ 72 ] ) produces @xmath264 the moment @xmath245 is the delay time of outgoing particles from under the barrier .",

    "63 ] , [ 67 ] , [ 71 ] , and [ 80 ] determine the maximum outgoing flux of particles tunneling through the potential barrier ( [ 74 ] ) in the case of a weak non - stationary signal ( [ 2 ] ) with @xmath258 .",
    "[ 80 ] is analogous to the formula ( [ 50 ] ) for the triangular potential . when @xmath266 the perturbation theory breaks down and the result becomes to be very non - linear function of the non - stationary pulse like eq .",
    "we see that the relation ( [ 3 ] ) plays a crucial role in physics of tunneling under non - stationary conditions . for the potential barrier ( [ 74 ] ) @xmath255 appears in a `` natural '' way as a result of analytical properties , whereas for a non - analytical potential it is determined by the time of motion between a turning point and a point of the non - analytical singularity of the potential ( @xmath77 in the case of the triangular potential ( [ 4 ] ) ) .",
    "in the case of the triangular potential barrier the semiclassical theory in a non - stationary case is constructed based on classical trajectories in the complex time .",
    "this becomes possible since for such barrier non - semiclassical corrections can be calculated exactly .",
    "the conditions of applicability of the semiclassical approach ( softly varying and not very small pulse ) are not surprising .",
    "much less trivial matter is the way of construction of the trajectory method .",
    "the condition ( [ 3 ] ) of coincidence of singularity of a trajectory and of a field leads to unexpected conclusions .",
    "the threshold energy @xmath36 , set by the condition ( [ 3 ] ) , divides the all incident flux of particles by two groups : ( i ) particles with @xmath37 passes the barrier practically like in a stationary case , ( ii ) particles with lower energies @xmath39 are affected strongly by the pulse which collects all particles after passing the barrier at the same energy @xmath36 regardless their initial energy .",
    "this enables to use short pulses , adapted to the necessary energy level by the relation ( [ 3 ] ) , to get outgoing particles collected at this level at some moment of time . in other words ,",
    "adapted signals can be used for a selective control of tunneling : in solids and molecules it excites only some particular bonds leaving other bonds non - excited .",
    "there is an obvious advantage of use soft signals for control of tunneling .",
    "the hard pulse of the type ( [ 2 ] ) can not control tunneling selectively , since it kicks up all particles to the top of the barrier .",
    "when the pulse ( [ 2 ] ) serves as an envelope for the monochromatic signal of the frequency @xmath267 it provides in a non - selective manner equal @xmath8-shifts of all escaping particles with respect to their incident energies .",
    "it is remarkable , the soft gaussian signal @xmath268 can not produce a strong enhancement of tunneling when its amplitude is much less than a static field of a potential barrier .",
    "this is an indication of importance of the analytical structure of the signal ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "this can be understood in another way looking at eq .",
    "[ 1 ] , where the fourier harmonics of the gaussian signal @xmath269 do not result in divergence in @xmath8 .    the static electric field in solids and molecules can be estimated as @xmath270 , a typical pulse width is in the range of tens of femtoseconds , and the amplitude of the electric field of the pulse can be chosen as @xmath271 , what is reachable in experiments .",
    "the developed theory is also applicable to quantum mechanical over - barrier reflection of particles .",
    "the reflection of classical waves ( electromagnetic , hydrodynamic , etc . ) from a spatially - smooth medium also may be described by the above theory , when the medium is influenced by an adapted signal .",
