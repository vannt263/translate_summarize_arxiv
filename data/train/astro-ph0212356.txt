    "the clustering of galaxies has long been an essential testing ground for cosmological models and the theory of galaxy formation , with comparisons between predicted and observed clustering driving much of the progress in cosmology during the 1970s and 1980s .",
    "such comparisons provided early support for gravitational instability as the central mechanism of structure formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , for initial conditions with a power spectrum redder than white noise ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , for a `` bottom up '' rather than `` top down '' sequence of gravitational clustering ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , for an approximately gaussian distribution of primordial fluctuations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the growth of galaxy redshift surveys has led to measurements of increasing precision and detail , and cosmological n - body simulations have developed into a powerful tool for calculating the gravitational clustering of collisionless dark matter from specified initial conditions .",
    "the main obstacle to drawing stronger inferences from the data is the dependence of theoretical predictions on _ both _ the relatively straightforward physics of gravitational clustering , which largely determines the distribution of dark matter , and the more complex physics of galaxy formation , which determines the relation between galaxies and mass , often referred to generically as `` bias . ''    in this paper , we study galaxy clustering and galaxy bias in a large ( @xmath6 particles , @xmath7 cube ) , smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulation of a low density , inflationary cold dark matter universe with a cosmological constant ( @xmath0cdm ) .",
    "our goals are , first , to see whether the currently leading cosmological model and `` standard '' galaxy formation physics as incarnated in our sph simulation can reproduce existing observations , and , second , to give guidance for the physical interpretation of those observations and for the design of more demanding tests of the theoretical predictions .",
    "the n - body+hydro approach to _ ab initio _ predictions of galaxy bias has a substantial history , beginning with dissipative `` sticky particle '' simulations by @xcite and continuing in the early 1990s with simulations using sph @xcite or eulerian grid hydrodynamics @xcite to model galaxy formation in a representative ( but small ) cosmological volume .",
    "the present paper is a direct descendant of katz et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , but we study a different cosmological model , we incorporate improvements to the physical treatment of radiative cooling and star formation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter kwh ) , and , above all , we take advantage of the parallel implementation of treesph @xcite and advances in computer technology to simulate a volume more than 90 times larger than that of katz et al .  (",
    "1992 ) , at similar resolution .",
    "our analysis overlaps significantly with other recent studies using large volume sph @xcite or eulerian hydrodynamics @xcite simulations .",

    "ab initio _ predictions of bias have gained currency in recent years : high - resolution , collisionless n - body simulations that identify galaxies with `` subhalos '' in the dark matter distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a hybrid method that combines n - body simulations of the dark matter component with semi - analytic treatments of the galaxy formation physics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we will discuss comparisons of our results to those from other hydrodynamic simulations and from the high - resolution n - body and hybrid approaches as they arise .",
    "we carry out a detailed comparison between our simulation and the semi - analytic model of @xcite in a separate paper that focuses on the `` halo occupation distribution '' ( hod ) predicted by the two methods @xcite .",
    "the hod description can be used to calculate many different galaxy clustering statistics , and it helps explain the origin of bias in a physically intuitive manner ( see @xcite and references therein ) . based on this comparison , we conclude that our sph approach and benson et al.s ( @xcite ) semi - analytic method should yield similar predictions for most galaxy clustering statistics .    here",
    "we focus mainly on the `` classic '' measurements of galaxy clustering  the two - point correlation function , variance of galaxy counts , and pairwise velocity moments  and on one of the simplest measures of higher - order clustering , the third moment of counts - in - cells .",
    "large redshift surveys like the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) now allow precise measurements of these quantities for multiple classes of galaxies , defined by luminosity , color , morphology , or spectral type ( see , e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) . while we can not model these variations with galaxy type in detail",
    " our simulation volume is far smaller than these surveys , and we do not resolve the morphology of the simulated galaxies  we can examine the predicted trends of clustering with baryon mass , stellar population age , and local environment .",
    "we concentrate on present - day clustering , but we also compute the evolution of the two - point function , which can be compared to results from deep redshift surveys and to studies of lyman - break galaxies at @xmath21 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the discovery that the clustering of lyman - break galaxies is similar to that of @xmath22 galaxies at @xmath8 , despite the weaker expected clustering of the underlying mass distribution , provides strong evidence that the bright galaxy population was highly biased at @xmath21 , even if galaxies roughly trace mass today .",
    "galaxy - galaxy weak lensing is an important new observational probe of the relation between galaxies and dark matter , measuring the galaxy - mass cross - correlation function and the extended mass distributions around galaxies of different types and in different environments .",
    "we will devote considerable attention to modeling recent observations of this phenomenon .",
    "the closest similar efforts are those of @xcite , who present predictions from a hydrodynamic simulation at @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and @xcite and @xcite , who analyze the n - body+semi - analytic galaxy distribution of @xcite .",
    "one strength of the hydrodynamic simulation approach is that it predicts properties of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) in addition to the galaxy population .",
    "we have used the simulation analyzed here to model the phase distribution of baryons in the present day universe @xcite , the x - ray background @xcite , x - ray emission from galaxy groups @xcite , and x - ray absorption by the diffuse igm @xcite . in combination with other simulations ,",
    "we have used it to study cooling radiation and sub - millimeter emission from young galaxies ( @xcite , @xcite ) , the relative importance of mergers and smooth accretion in galaxy assembly @xcite , and the correlations between galaxies and the ly@xmath25  forest at high redshift @xcite .",
    "the observed distributions and correlations of galaxy properties , in particular the luminosity function and the tully - fisher ( @xcite ) relation , are also essential tests of the galaxy formation model , and any discrepancies with these observations can provide insight into the model s failings .",
    "we will consider these characteristics of the galaxy population in a separate paper ( katz et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , though the comparison to observed galaxy - galaxy lensing measurements will bring up some of the same issues here .",
    "we proceed to a description of our numerical methods in  [ sec : methods ] , to predictions of galaxy clustering in  [ sec : clust ] , and to the galaxy - mass correlation function and comparison to lensing measurements in  [ sec : gdm ] .",
    "we recap our findings and discuss their implications in  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "we employ a hydrodynamic simulation of a @xmath0cdm  model with @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath26 , inflationary spectral index @xmath4 , and a power spectrum normalization @xmath27 .",
    "this model is consistent with most available observational constraints @xcite , including cobe normalization @xcite , cluster masses @xcite , cosmic shear ( @xcite , and references therein ) , the deuterium abundance in high - redshift lyman limit systems @xcite , the hubble diagram of type ia supernovae @xcite , and the flux power spectrum of the ly@xmath25  forest @xcite .",
    "our initial conditions represent a random @xmath7 ( comoving ) cube , realized with @xmath28 gas and @xmath28 dark matter particles in a triply periodic volume , yielding particle masses of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "these initial conditions are evolved from redshift @xmath31 using parallel treesph @xcite .",
    "we soften the gravitational force via a @xmath32 ( comoving ) spline kernel , equivalent to a plummer softening of @xmath33 .",
    "for particle timesteps we use the criteria described by kwh and @xcite , setting the tolerance parameter @xmath34 ( defined in these papers ) to 0.4 .",
    "the simulation was evolved to @xmath24 on the cray t3e at sdsc and finished on the sgi origin 2000 at ncsa .",
    "we include radiative cooling for primordial composition gas as described by kwh .",
    "the tests in @xcite show that photoheating by an ionizing background artificially suppresses the formation of low mass galaxies in a simulation of this resolution , but that a simulation evolved without an ionizing background produces much the same galaxy population ( above its resolution limit ) as a higher resolution simulation with an ionizing background .",
    "though @xcite considered an @xmath19 cdm model rather than @xmath0cdm , we expect their conclusions to carry over to this model , and we therefore evolve the simulation with no ionizing background .",
    "we incorporate star formation using the algorithm described and tested by kwh .",
    "this algorithm converts cold , dense gas into collisionless stars at a rate governed by the local dynamical and cooling timescales , returning supernova feedback as thermal energy to the surrounding medium .",
    "the tests in kwh and @xcite show that the resulting galaxy population is insensitive to the one free parameter of the algorithm and is similar to that identified using cold gas in a simulation without star formation ; it is gravity , gas dynamics , and radiative cooling that determine where galaxies form and how massive they will be .",
    "a radical change to the star formation or feedback algorithm might alter the galaxy population in a significant way , but provided that it gave the same _ relative _ masses and ages of the galaxies ( more precisely , that it preserved their rank order ) , it would not affect the clustering results presented here , except for the absolute values of mass - to - light ratios discussed in  [ sec : gdm ] .",
    "our numerical approach is similar to those used by @xcite ( @xcite , @xcite ) and @xcite , but we have opted for a somewhat smaller volume and larger particle number , and consequently higher resolution .",

    "other hints of a similar discrepancy include the high overall fraction of stellar mass in the simulation @xcite and the relatively high stellar mass - to - light ratios required to match the observed galaxy luminosity function ( katz et al .",

    "we believe that these excessive galaxy baryon masses are largely numerical in origin .",
    "a comparison of two simulations of the same @xmath300 volume , one with the same resolution as the @xmath97 simulation analyzed here and one with a mass resolution eight times higher , shows that the _ same _ galaxies are on average more massive in the lower resolution simulation , by @xmath296 at the @xmath301 completeness limit rising to a factor @xmath180 at masses of several@xmath302 ( fardal et al . , in preparation ; one can see hints of this effect in the mass function comparison of figure  [ fig : massfun ] ) .",
    "the higher baryon masses at low resolution probably arise from the overestimated cooling rate of hot gas particles in the vicinity of cold , dense clumps @xcite .",
    "an alternative formulation of sph that performs better in the presence of contact discontinuities between cold and hot phases indeed leads to lower galaxy baryon masses , typically by a factor @xmath180 @xcite .",
    "empirically , we find that the relation @xmath303 provides a fairly accurate scaling between masses in the `` low resolution '' and `` high resolution '' simulations .",
    "the dashed curve in figure  [ fig : mckay ] shows the effect of applying this empirical scaling .",
    "it represents our best guess at the results we would obtain from a @xmath304 particle simulation of the same @xmath97 volume .",
    "comparison to still higher resolution simulations at @xmath10 suggests that this is sufficient to yield numerically converged baryon masses , but we have not yet been able to carry out such a test at @xmath8 .    clearly , there are still systematic uncertainties in the observational results ( the weak lensing measurements themselves and the @xmath295 scaling ) and in the numerical convergence of the simulation predictions . however , the resolution - corrected predictions and the observationally inferred mass ratios agree well at log@xmath305 and 11.7 , with a factor @xmath180 gap at the intermediate mass scale log@xmath306 .",
    "the sharp drop between the second and third groups of observational data points is somewhat surprising , at least given the smooth predicted trend , so a full assessment of the comparison should await improved observational estimates , which should be available soon .",
    "nonetheless , the current level of overall agreement does not leave much room for additional astrophysical processes , such as agn feedback or stronger stellar feedback , to substantially reduce the baryon masses of galaxies with @xmath307 .",
    "we would probably predict lower values of @xmath16 ( and thus require some suppression of baryon mass ) if we adopted lower @xmath211 or higher @xmath38 , without changing the assumed @xmath308 or @xmath309 shape .",
    "however , for our adopted cosmological parameters , the lensing comparison suggests that this simulation already incorporates the astrophysics needed to understand the baryon masses of luminous galaxies , within the current numerical and observational uncertainties .",
    "the constraints from galaxy - galaxy lensing complement those from the tully - fisher relation and the luminosity function , which we will discuss elsewhere ( katz et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "for the full population of galaxies with @xmath310 , our simulation predicts a bias factor @xmath192 of unity at @xmath8 . beneath this rms similarity of fluctuation amplitudes , however , lie numerous differences between the galaxy and dark matter distributions , in terms of present - day structure and the evolution of that structure .",
    "the bias defined by rms fluctuations or by correlation functions is strongly redshift dependent . if we choose a galaxy population of fixed comoving space density ( above a redshift - dependent baryon mass threshold ) , then the galaxy correlation function stays approximately constant from @xmath10 to @xmath8 , so that bias is initially large and declines towards unity as the dark matter catches up to the galaxies ( see figure  [ fig : corrall ] ) .",
    "the bias is scale - dependent in the non - linear regime , and this scale dependence itself depends on redshift . at @xmath8 , the galaxy correlation function",
    "is depressed below the dark matter correlation function at @xmath128 and boosted above it at @xmath311 . as a consequence",
    ", the galaxy correlation function is well described by a power law ( of slope @xmath312 ) , while the dark matter correlation function is not ( see figure  [ fig : powerlaw ] ) .",
    "the dark matter correlation function is shallower at high redshift while the galaxy correlation function slope is roughly constant , so the rms bias factors at @xmath199 and @xmath191 start to diverge at @xmath313 ( see figure  [ fig : bsigma ] ) .",
    "the correlation amplitude depends on galaxy baryon mass , with only a slight difference between the more and less massive halves of the complete sample ( figure  [ fig : corrsub]b ) but significant increases of @xmath84 and @xmath190 result if we select the 500 or 200 most massive galaxies in the simulation volume ( figures  [ fig : r0gamma ] and  [ fig : bsigma ] , table  [ tab : subsample ] ) .",
    "the dependence of the correlation amplitude on stellar population age is more striking than the dependence on baryon mass .",
    "the correlation functions of the older and younger halves of the complete sample have almost identical slopes , but their correlation lengths differ by nearly a factor of two ( figure  [ fig : corrsub ] , table  [ tab : subsample ] ) .    \\5 . at @xmath8 , the pairwise velocity dispersion @xmath314 of galaxies is lower than that of the dark matter , by @xmath13 ( figure  [ fig : pv ] ) .",
    "there is a large difference between the pairwise dispersions of old and young galaxies , with the preferential location of old galaxies in dense environments making @xmath314 about twice as high at @xmath315 .",
    "the mean pairwise velocity @xmath316 is similar for galaxies and dark matter at @xmath8 , but the denser environments of older galaxies again cause a higher @xmath316 . at @xmath23 , the positive spatial bias of the galaxy population",
    "makes the mean pairwise velocity higher than that of the dark matter , though the pairwise dispersion remains somewhat lower .",
    "the skewness of galaxy count fluctuations , as quantified by the hierarchical ratio @xmath218 , is lower than that of the dark matter by @xmath13 ( figure  [ fig : s3 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath218 ratio and its scale dependence vary with galaxy baryon mass and age , in a fairly complex way .    \\7 .",
    "the galaxy - mass cross - correlation function depends on galaxy mass and age in much the same way that the galaxy - galaxy correlation function itself does , though the trends are weaker because the mass distribution is the same in all cross - correlations ( figure  [ fig : gmxisub ] ) . for each class of galaxies ,",
    "the bias function defined by the ratio @xmath260 is roughly scale - independent , even when it is significantly different from unity , though it can be somewhat different in amplitude and shape from the analogous bias function @xmath317^{1/2}$ ] ( figure  [ fig : gmxibias ] ) .",
    "the average extended mass distributions around galaxies depend significantly on baryon mass and age ( figure  [ fig : massgal ] ) .",
    "the distribution around a typical high mass galaxy falls more steeply than an isothermal distribution , so that circular velocity curves @xmath318^{1/2}$ ] decline from @xmath319 out to @xmath269 . for low mass galaxies , on the other hand",
    ", the average mass profile is shallower than isothermal at @xmath320 , where the individual galaxy halos begin to encounter the environment of a typical surrounding group .",
    "this effect is much more pronounced for old galaxies than for young galaxies .",
    "the ratio of mean aperture mass @xmath275 to galaxy baryon mass @xmath15 is roughly independent of baryon mass for apertures ranging from @xmath280 to @xmath269 , though the ratio is higher for the galaxies with the lowest @xmath15 . the ratio is higher for old galaxies than for young galaxies , again demonstrating the preferential location of old galaxies in dense environments .    for the most part , the dark matter clustering of the @xmath0cdm model and these biases of the galaxy population lead to good qualitative and , where we have adequate statistics for comparison , quantitative agreement with observed galaxy clustering .",
    "the predicted galaxy correlation function is a power law of the observed slope and approximately the observed amplitude ( see further discussion below ) .",
    "the redshift - independence of the comoving correlation length agrees with measurements from lyman - break galaxy surveys at @xmath21 @xcite and from deep redshift surveys extending to @xmath119 @xcite .",
    "the predicted dependence of clustering strength on baryon mass and population age agrees with the trends as a function of luminosity , color , and spectral type found in the 2dfgrs and sdss @xcite .",
    "the predicted value of the hierarchical ratio @xmath218 agrees with measurements from angular clustering catalogs @xcite .",
    "the value and scale - independence of the bias inferred from the ratio of galaxy - galaxy and galaxy - mass correlation functions agrees with recent observational estimates @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the galaxy - mass correlation function on population age parallels the dependence on galaxy type found by @xcite , and the aperture mass @xmath14 is approximately proportional to galaxy baryon mass , as @xcite also find .",
    "there are three quantitative discrepancies between our predictions and existing measurements , two fairly subtle and one more substantial .",
    "first , the power law slope of @xmath86 for the @xmath22-galaxy sample ( the 500 most massive galaxies in the box at @xmath8 ) is slightly too steep , @xmath137 compared to observed values of @xmath321 , and there are hints of a departure from a power law at @xmath132 .",
    "second , the correlation length of this sample , @xmath134 , is low compared to the value @xmath322 measured for @xmath96-selected galaxies with @xmath323 in the sdss @xcite , though it is consistent with the value @xmath324 found for @xmath22 @xmath159-selected galaxies in the 2dfgrs @xcite .",
    "because of the still - limited size of our simulation volume , these discrepancies are of marginal statistical significance , and the n - body tests discussed in  [ sec : corrall ] imply that the low correlation length , at least , is a consequence of the lower than average fluctuation amplitude in the particular realization of @xmath0cdm initial conditions used here .",
    "the more serious quantitative discrepancy is the ratio of aperture mass @xmath14 to galaxy baryon mass @xmath15 . for @xmath325",
    ", the simulation prediction agrees with the result derived by combining mckay et al.s ( @xcite ) values of @xmath326 with kauffmann et al.s ( @xcite ) stellar mass - to - light ratios , but at higher @xmath15 the predicted ratios are lower than the observationally inferred values by factors of @xmath17 , implying that the galaxy baryon masses in the simulation are too high ( figure  [ fig : mckay ] ) . as discussed in  [ sec : gdm ] , we believe that this discrepancy is mostly numerical in origin , since our internal resolution tests ( fardal et al . , in preparation ) and comparisons between different sph implementations @xcite suggest that galaxy baryon masses are indeed overestimated by about this factor in this mass range , relative to a simulation with higher resolution or more accurate treatment of the interface between hot and cold gas phases . a comparison between our best guess at resolution - corrected results and the @xcite data points yields fairly good agreement in the average values of @xmath16 , which leaves little room for additional astrophysical processes , such as more aggressive feedback , to substantially suppress gas cooling and star formation in this galaxy mass range . consistent with this conclusion ,",
    "@xcite find that the n - body + semi - analytic models of @xcite , which do include much stronger stellar feedback , predict @xmath286 ratios that are too low ( by a factor @xmath180 ) relative to those of @xcite .",
    "as emphasized by @xcite and @xcite , the constraints from galaxy - galaxy lensing measurements complement those from the galaxy luminosity function and the tully - fisher and fundamental plane relations because they suffer different systematic uncertainties and have different sensitivity to astrophysical and cosmological parameters .",
    "for example , lowering @xmath211 while keeping other parameters ( including the linear power spectrum ) fixed would tend to lower @xmath327 while having relatively little impact on the luminosity function ( though galaxy formation , and hence galaxy luminosities , would still be affected by the different timescales and baryon - to - dark matter ratios of the lower @xmath211 model ) .",
    "the weak lensing constraints will become considerably more powerful as the precision and detail of the measurements improves .    where we have been able to compare",
    ", our results generally agree well with those of other hydrodynamic simulations @xcite , high resolution n - body simulations that identify galaxies with sub - halos @xcite , and combined n - body + semi - analytic models @xcite .",
    "all of these methods make qualitatively similar predictions for the evolution of the galaxy correlation function , the bias between galaxies and mass at the present day , the dependence of that bias on galaxy type , and the relative amplitude of dark matter and galaxy pairwise dispersions .",
    "this agreement suggests that these aspects of galaxy clustering and bias arise from robust aspects of the physics of galaxy formation that all of these methods treat correctly , or at least similarly .",
    "our conclusions about @xmath218 and galaxy - mass correlations are for the most part new , but we do not expect them to be fundamentally different from the predictions of other methods .    returning to the main goals of the paper , we find that the combination of a @xmath0cdm cosmology with standard ideas about galaxy formation is , on the whole , remarkably successful at reproducing observed galaxy clustering and galaxy - galaxy lensing measurements . in terms of physical interpretation ,",
    "the simulation analysis offers a number of insights .",
    "it shows that the detailed relation between the galaxy and dark halo populations can account for the difference between the predicted correlation function of dark matter and the observed power law form of the galaxy correlation function , and between the predicted pairwise velocity dispersion of the dark matter and the observed , lower dispersion of galaxies .",
    "it shows that the observed dependence of galaxy clustering on galaxy properties emerges naturally from the dependence of galaxy mass and population age on environment  basically , older and more massive galaxies form in regions that collapse early and are today biased with respect to the overall mass distribution .",
    "it shows that values of @xmath328 and @xmath329 can emerge even when galaxies do not trace mass in detail .",
    "the quantitative discrepancies discussed above may also prove instructive , as the observations improve and the uncertainties in the simulations themselves are more thoroughly understood .",
    "our analysis makes a number of predictions that can be tested with future data , or with future analyses of existing data .",
    "our quantitative comparison to the observed type dependence of galaxy clustering has been limited by our finite simulation volume , which prevents us from predicting the clustering of rare classes of galaxies . however , it would be straightforward to test the quantitative predictions presented in , for example , figure  [ fig : corrsub ] by taking an observed sample above a luminosity threshold that yields the same space density as our complete sample and dividing it in two based on luminosity or color ( or , better still , on the basis of stellar mass and population age , using techniques like those of @xcite ) .",
    "the predicted evolution of the mean pairwise velocity and pairwise dispersion ( figure  [ fig : pv ] ) can be tested with upcoming large redshift surveys like the deep and virmos - vlt programs .",
    "the systematic variations of @xmath218 with galaxy luminosity and age ( figure  [ fig : s3 ] ) can be tested with the 2dfgrs and sdss .",
    "the most informative comparisons will probably come from improved measurements of galaxy - galaxy lensing and cosmic shear , which will allow detailed tests of the trends predicted in figures  [ fig : gmxibias ] and  [ fig : massgal ] .    on all of these fronts ,",
    "observational efforts are advancing at a staggering pace .",
    "comparisons between more comprehensive data and improved theoretical predictions over the next few years should tell us whether our understanding of dark matter clustering and the physics of galaxy formation is indeed complete , at least in terms of features that have major quantitative impact , or whether there are still important ingredients missing from our theoretical recipe .    we thank andreas berlind , stephane colombi , mark fardal , henk hoekstra , guinevere kauffmann , tim mckay , yannick mellier , and ludo van waerbeke for valuable discussions on numerous aspects of this study . this work was supported by the nsf and by the nasa astrophysical theory program and long - term space astrophysics program .",

    "<S> we investigate galaxy clustering and the correlations between galaxies and mass in the @xmath0cdm cosmological model ( inflationary cold dark matter with @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) , using a large , smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulation ( sph , with @xmath6 particles in a @xmath7 cube ) . </S>",
    "<S> simulated galaxies can be unambiguously identified as clumps of stars and cold gas a few kpc to a few tens of kpc across , residing in extended halos of hot gas and dark matter ; the space density of the resolved galaxy population at @xmath8 corresponds to that of observed galaxies with luminosity @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the galaxy correlation function , the pairwise velocity dispersion and mean pairwise velocity , and the second and third moments of counts - in - cells ; we also investigate the galaxy - mass correlation function and the average extended mass distributions around galaxies , both of which can be measured via galaxy - galaxy lensing . for the most part , the predicted biases between galaxies and dark matter lead to good agreement with current observations , including : ( 1 ) a nearly constant comoving correlation length from @xmath10 to @xmath8 for mass - selected galaxy samples of constant comoving space density ; ( 2 ) an rms bias factor @xmath11 at @xmath8 ; ( 3 ) a scale - dependent bias on small scales that transforms the curved dark matter correlation function into a nearly power - law galaxy correlation function ; ( 4 ) galaxy pairwise dispersion and hierarchical skewness ratio @xmath12 in good agreement with observed values , and lower than values for the dark matter by @xmath13 ; ( 5 ) a ratio of galaxy - galaxy to galaxy - mass correlation functions consistent with recent measurements from the red cluster sequence survey ; and ( 6 ) a mean excess mass @xmath14 approximately proportional to galaxy baryon mass @xmath15 , in agreement with estimates from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . </S>",
    "<S> all of these clustering properties vary with galaxy baryon mass and , more strongly , with the age of a galaxy s stellar population . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted dependences are in good qualitative agreement with the observed dependence of galaxy clustering and the galaxy - mass correlation function on galaxy type . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted ratio @xmath16 is lower than the sdss estimates by a factor of @xmath17 for galaxies with @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> a test with a higher resolution ( smaller volume ) simulation suggests that this discrepancy is mostly a numerical artifact ; if so , then the sdss weak lensing comparison leaves little room for feedback or other astrophysical processes to reduce the stellar masses of luminous galaxies , at least given our adopted cosmological parameters . on the whole , </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the @xmath0cdm model and the galaxy formation physics incorporated in the sph simulation give a good account of observed galaxy clustering , but anticipated improvements in clustering and weak lensing measurements will soon test this picture in much greater detail . </S>"
