    "the kochen - specker ( ks ) theorem @xcite contains one of the most fundamental findings in quantum mechanics ( qm ) : yes - no questions about an individual physical system can not be assigned a unique answer in such a way that the result of measuring any mutually commuting subset of these yes - no questions can be interpreted as revealing these preexisting answers . to be precise , the ks theorem asserts that , in a hilbert space with a finite dimension , @xmath0 , it is possible to construct a set of @xmath1 projection operators , which represent yes - no questions about an individual physical system , so that none of the @xmath2 possible sets of `` yes '' or `` no '' answers is compatible with the sum rule of qm for orthogonal resolutions of the identity ( i.e. , if the sum of a subset of mutually orthogonal projection operators is the identity , one and only one of the corresponding answers ought to be `` yes '' ) .",
    "this conclusion holds irrespective of the quantum state of the system .",
    "implicit in the ks theorem is the assumption of _ noncontextuality _ : each yes - no question is assigned a single unique answer , independent of which subset of mutually commuting projection operators one might consider it with .",
    "therefore , the ks theorem discards hidden - variable theories with this property , known as noncontextual hidden - variable ( nchv ) theories .",
    "local hidden - variable theories , such as those discarded by bell s theorem @xcite , are a particular type of nchv theories , so in this sense , the ks theorem is more general than bell s theorem .",
    "however , while bell s theorem has been successfully tested in the laboratory @xcite , the translation of any proof of the ks theorem into an experiment on an individual system seems to be an impossible task .",
    "this is so because the @xmath1 projection operators appearing in a proof of the ks theorem can be combined in @xmath3 different orthogonal resolutions of the identity , and each of them represents a maximal test which is incompatible with the other @xmath4 maximal tests .",
    "however , we have recently presented an experiment which seems to challenge the idea that the ks theorem can not be tested in the laboratory : a test on an individual system of a two - part two - state system ( prepared in whatever quantum state ) exists for which the predictions of any nchv theory always differ with those of qm @xcite .",
    "this test would be related somehow with some of the proofs of the ks theorem .",
    "the smallest proof of the ks theorem currently known contains eighteen projection operators ( yes - no questions ) which can be combined in nine resolutions of the identity ( maximal tests ) of a four - dimensional hilbert space , @xmath5 @xcite . both results , @xcite and @xcite , concern to physical systems described in @xmath5 , and it would be interesting to establish which is the connection between them @xcite .",
    "that is precisely the aim of this paper .",
    "the proof of the ks theorem with eighteen projection operators in @xmath5 is given in table i @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     table iii : possible values in a nchv theory for the observables and yes - no questions involved in the ninth test of the ks theorem in @xmath6 .",
    "+    as can easily be seen studying table iii :    \\(a ) for each of the four tests involving only factorizable yes - no questions ( columns 1 to 4 in table ii ) nchv theories predict that one and only one of the answers must be `` yes '' . the same prediction as in qm .",
    "note that if , instead of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , we choose any other spin component , then the predictions of both qm and nchv theories will still agree .",
    "\\(b ) for each of the four tests involving factorizable and entangled yes - no questions ( columns 5 to 8 in table ii ) nchv theories also predict that one and only one of the answers must be `` yes '' . as qm does .",
    "note that the choice of spin components @xmath7 and @xmath8 allows the corresponding two - particle observables to have a common eigenvalue so the corresponding yes - no question can be represented in qm by a projection operator .",
    "\\(c ) finally , consider the last test , involving only entangled yes - no questions ( column 9 in table ii ) . if one checks table iii , one reaches the conclusion that in a nchv theory the four yes - no questions appearing in column 9 in table ii are _ not _ mutually _ exclusive _ ( since the answers to two of them can be `` yes '' ) nor _ not exhaustive _ ( since the answers to all of them can be `` no '' ) .",
    "the quantum prediction is radically different . in qm , these four yes - no questions ( or , to be precise , their corresponding projectors )",
    "form an orthogonal resolution of the identity , so they represent mutually exclusive and exhaustive questions : the answers must be one `` yes '' and three `` no '' .",
    "in brief , the predictions of qm and nchv agree for the first eight tests of the eighteen vector s proof of the ks theorem in @xmath6 , but disagree for the ninth test .",
    "this clarifies the relationship between this proof , originally proposed in @xcite , and the test on nchv theories proposed in @xcite .",
    "a joint measurement on a single system of the four projection operators appearing in the ninth test is closely related @xcite to the problem of performing a measurement of a nondegenerate bell operator @xcite .",
    "such a measurement is also required for reliable ( i.e. , with 100% theoretical probability of success ) double density quantum coding @xcite and for reliable teleportation @xcite .",
    "it has recently been proved @xcite that a measurement of a nondegenerate bell operator can not be achieved without using quantum systems interacting one with the other , a condition which is not fulfilled in recent experiments @xcite , but which could be achieved with atoms and electro - magnetic cavities @xcite in near - future experiments .",
    "this paper is the response to a question raised by lucien hardy after a talk at oxford university in may 1998 .",
    "i would like to thank mark s. child and gonzalo garca de polavieja for inviting me to give that talk .",
