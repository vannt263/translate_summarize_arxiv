    "for over 50 years from the appearance of the seminal _ zur elektrodynamik bewegter krper _ @xcite , only the lorentz transformations of the 4-coordinates of `` events '' were considered in the literature , but not how relativistically moving bodies would _ appear _ when looked at or photographed .",
    "this was first done independently and ( relatively ) simultaneously by @xcite and @xcite ; the former showed that the projected outline of a relativistically moving sphere is always a circle , while the latter provided a more extensive discussion of the appearance of moving bodies and pointed out the key features of observing relativistically moving bodies : they appear both _",

    "( more details will be given below ) .",
    "the motivation for writing the present paper is work on interpreting observations of relativistic jets ( * ? ? ? * e.g. , ) , where the need arises to infer physical properties of the jet fluid in its own rest frame from observations , subject to corrections due to relativistic beaming , whose magnitude is , however , not known from observations .",
    "a particular quantity of interest is the rest - frame minimum - energy magnetic - field estimate for a synchrotron source @xcite , and there are different opinions in the literature about how the true rest - frame minimum - energy field scales with the relativistic doppler factor compared to that inferred assuming a non - relativistic source ( compare eqn .",
    "a3 of * ? ? ?",
    "* to eqn .",
    "some of the argument revolves around whether the observed morphological features of jets are `` blobs '' or `` jets '' , and their ( apparently ) different beaming properties .",
    "given these differences of opinion on how to `` de - beam '' properly , it is perhaps surprising that nasa s astrophysics data system lists only three papers on interpreting jet observations as citing @xcite , and his results do not seem to be part of the common knowledge of jet researchers .",
    "one of the citing papers is @xcite , who consider the implications of relativistic beaming on the difference between observed and intrinsic source counts and give detailed formulae for relating observed and jet - frame fluxes and emissivities .",
    "some of these formulae had already been presented in the seminal paper by @xcite .",
    "it appears that the difficulties in interpreting jet observations arise because the problem under consideration is ill - posed . as will be argued in detail below ,",
    "what matters for interpreting jet observations subject to unknown beaming paramters is that we have observed the 2-dimensional projection of a source s appearance onto the plane of the sky and try to infer the source s rest - frame properties from this projection .",
    "confusion arises because most formulae in the literature consider what happens to the observed quantities when a _ fixed source _ moves with different lorentz factors and at different line - of - sight angles to the observer , while in observations , it is the _ projection _ of the source which is held constant . furthermore , the effects of light - travel time delays along the line of sight are typically only mentioned explicitly in work comparing jet simulations to observations , e.g. , in @xcite and @xcite , but not in the observational literature .",
    "this and the preference for adopting the fixed - source view may be related to the fact that lorentz transformations are usually covered in great detail in a typical course on special relativity , but @xcite and @xcite are hardly mentioned in relativity textbooks .",
    "this leads to the present paper with the following outline : the remainder of the introduction summarizes the results by @xcite and @xcite and sets out some basic definitions and terminology .",
    "the appearance of relativistic objects , and in particular of astrophysical jets , is discussed in  [ s : appearance ] , both from a theoretical point of view and using a simple ray - tracer .",
    "ready - to - use formulae for relating jet - frame quantities to observables are given in ",
    "[ s : beaming ] , including the minimum - energy field .",
    "the discussion and summary are given in ",
    "[ s : disc ] , while appendix  [ s : illustr.lor ] describes some _ gedankenexperimente _ on non - conventional world - map measurements that lead to length expansion and time acceleration .      as first noted by @xcite",
    ", there is a fundamental difference in relativity between the _ locations _ ( 4-coordinates ) of events as judged by observers that are local to the events and equipped with sets of clocks that are synchronized in their rest frame , and the _ appearance _ of relativistically moving bodies as judged by distant observers by means of photons that are received simultaneously ; a little earlier , @xcite had considered the special case of the observed outline of a relativistically moving sphere .",
    "the set of event locations is a _ world map _ , while the picture that is taken of the events is a _",
    "world picture_. in the special case of photons arriving at right angles to the detector taking the world picture , it is called a _ supersnapshot",
    "astronomical observations clearly fall under the definition of a supersnapshot .",
    "the appearance of relativistically moving objects in a supersnapshot is governed by two aspects of photon paths in special relativity @xcite :    1 .",
    "two photons traveling abreast with a separation @xmath0 in one frame ( i.e. , photons traveling `` alongside each other '' with @xmath0 measured perpendicular to their direction of motion ) do so in _ all _ frames .",
    "this is the case because @xmath1 is invariant under lorentz transformations and @xmath0 is a space - like interval .",
    "2 .   if a photon is traveling at an angle @xmath2 to the direction of motion of some frame that is moving with speed @xmath3 and lorentz factor @xmath4 with respect to an observer , the angle between the direction of motion and the photon direction in that frame is related to the angle @xmath5 between the direction of motion and the photon direction in the observer s frame by @xmath6 where @xmath7 etc . , or , equivalently , @xmath8 where @xmath9  is the relativistic doppler factor @xmath10^{-1}. \\label{eq : dopplerdef}\\ ] ]    the latter phenomenon is the well - known angle aberration ; the former is perhaps less well - known , but essential for the analysis of images of relativistically moving objects , and implies that the supersnapshot is a _ scaled _ version of the rest - frame image . taken together , they yield terrell s result that the appearance of such an object in a supersnapshot is simply the object s appearance as seen from the aberrated angle @xmath2 in its rest frame , with its apparent size along the direction of motion scaled by the doppler factor @xmath11 .    as a consequence of eq .",
    "( [ eq : costrans ] ) , even approaching objects appear to be seen `` from behind '' unless @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath13 ; in the limiting case @xmath14 , a relativistic object is seen exactly side - on in its rest frame and with exactly its rest - frame length as its `` projected '' length .",
    "it is useful clearly to set out the terminology for the remainder of the paper , because the brightness pattern observed in astrophysical jets can be at rest in frames that are different from both the observer frame , and the fluid rest frame , as discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "their discussion and notation is adopted here .",
    "it distinguishes between `` blob '' , `` jet '' and `` shock '' features , which are defined by being at rest in one of three frames relevant to the problem .",
    "thus , it is useful to give the definitions of the relevant frames together with those of the morphological terms :    1 .",
    "the `` observer frame '' is that in which the astronomer is at rest .",
    "once appropriate cosmological corrections are applied , the observer frame is conceptually identical to the frame in which the jet source and its host are at rest . +",
    "a `` jet '' feature is then a _ resolved _ brightness pattern whose outline is at rest in the observer frame .",
    "observer - frame quantities have no primes , e.g. @xmath15 for volume emissivity .",
    "the `` fluid frame '' is the rest frame of the emitting fluid , which is taken to be moving through the observer frame at relativistic speed .",
    "the term `` rest frame '' is used interchangeably with `` fluid frame '' . + a `` blob '' or `` plasmoid '' is a brightness pattern whose outline is at rest in the fluid frame .",
    "fluid - frame quantities will be designated by double primes , e.g. @xmath16 .",
    "a `` pattern '' or `` shock '' feature is a brightness pattern whose outline is at rest neither in the fluid nor in the observer frame , e.g. , a shock traveling through the jet fluid .",
    "it defines the third frame , the frame in which this pattern is at rest .",
    "pattern - frame quantities have single primes , e.g. @xmath17 .",
    "the emissivity of the fluid traveling through such a `` shock '' transforms according to the fluid s doppler factor @xmath18 , while its projected appearance and morphology are governed by the shock s doppler factor @xmath19 .",
    "these are fairly intuitive definitions .",
    "nevertheless , the difference between the `` blob '' and `` jet '' formulae in eqn .",
    "c7 of @xcite is just one of _ choice of integration boundaries _ , and in particular whether the integration boundaries are held fixed in the observer frame when @xmath11 is changed ( jet case ) or are allowed to vary according to the different projected morphology of a `` blob '' under changes of @xmath11 .",
    "thus , it is possible to apply a `` jet '' formula to a small segment of a blob as long as the integration boundaries are held fixed in the observer frame . in   [ s : beaming.blobs.restframe ] and [ s : beaming.jets.restframe ] below , i will present detailed formulae for converting observed to fluid - frame properties in each case , with expressions for the minimum - energy field in  [ s : disc.bmin.obsfixed ] .",
    "this section summarizes the basic definitions of surface brightness / intensity , flux density and luminosity of astronomical sources , as well as the beaming properties of blobs , jets , and shocks .",
    "i will give explicit formulae for observed surface brightness and total flux in terms of source parameters for simple geometries , as well as ray - tracing images showing the appearance of such sources in supersnapshots .",
    "for the computation of surface brightness and flux , i use the notation and formulae as given by @xcite and @xcite , assuming an optically thin , isotropic emission with a power - law emissivity @xmath20 that is constant within the emitting region .",
    "all observables will be expressed in terms of the emissivity @xmath16 in the fluid rest frame and the source size in the pattern frame @xmath21 , which is identical to the fluid and observer frame for a `` blob '' and `` jet '' , respectively .",
    "cosmological transformations , however , are not always given explicitly in order to simplify the notation ; they can be re - incorporated in the usual way by inserting appropriate powers of @xmath22 for cosmological redshifts , and using the appropriate cosmological distance measures .",
    "the surface brightness or intensity @xmath23 , flux density @xmath24 and luminosity @xmath25 of a source are given by @xmath26 where @xmath27  is the luminosity distance to the source , which has specific emissivity @xmath15 , volume v and projected surface area a.    the transformation properties of these quantities then follow from the relativistic invariance of @xmath28 and the volume transformation ( taken from appendix c of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath29 assuming optically thin emission makes the discussion appropriate for arcsecond - scale jets , where sources are not compact enough for self - absorption to become important .",
    "the difficulties of interpreting observations of optically thick sources , such as compact cores and milli - arcsecond scale jets , have been highlighted by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the essential point here is that the appearance of optically thick sources varies as function of viewing direction , and the relativistic angle aberration implies that the beamed appearance is governed by this intrinsic viewing angle dependence in addition to the flux and surface brigthness beaming .",
    "the volume transformation deserves separate consideration .",
    "the fact that the outline of the different kinds of brightness pattern is at rest in different frames has led some authors to write down different volume transformation formulae for astronomical observations of `` jets '' and `` blobs '' ( see * ? ? ? * , appendix  a , and ; * ? ? ? * , appendix  a , e.g. ) .",
    "however , what matters for the volume transformation of a feature identified in an astronomical image or radio map is only that the image is a supersnapshot .",
    "what matters for the interpretation of the supersnapshot is the volume of fluid whose photons arrive simultaneously on the _ supersnapshot _ , not the volume of fluid that is located within the jet volume in the _ world map_. hence , the correct volume transformation for any fluid volume @xmath30 observed by means of a supersnapshot is @xmath31 where @xmath18 is the doppler factor of the fluid in the observer frame .",
    "if the decisive criterion was not the fact that astronomical observations are supersnapshots , one could argue with equal justification that the correct volume transformation formula for the fluid in a jet section is @xmath32 because the jet volume is at rest in the observer frame and hence appears contracted in the rest frame of the fluid , or alternatively that the correct transformation is @xmath33 because the fluid is moving through the observer frame , and therefore _ it _ is contracted .",
    "both can of course be correct , depending on whether one is judging the jet volume with the help of events that are simultaneous in the fluid or the observer frame .",
    "however , a supersnapshot corresponds to neither world - map case  the supersnapshot criterion is photons _ arriving _ simultaneously at the observer , which nearly always does not correspond to photons _ being emitted _ simultaneously in any frame .",
    "that eq .",
    "( [ eq : vtrans ] ) is correct for both the `` jet '' and `` blob '' case can be seen also by considering a section of a `` jet '' as a collection of infinitesimal blobs that are each at rest in the fluid frame .",
    "alternatively , a `` jet '' can be considered as a section of a `` blob '' that is moving through a transparent gap in obscuring material that is at rest in the observer frame  if 90% of a blob s volume is covered in the observer frame , the rest - frame volume of the visible part is 10% of the blobs s total observer - frame volume , and hence must also be 10% of the blob s rest - frame volume .    as an alternative derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : vtrans ] ) , consider that the observer - frame volume of a `` jet '' or `` blob '' ( or an infinitesimal element of it ) is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is its extent transverse to the line of sight in the plane of its motion , @xmath36 is the extent perpendicular to both the line of sight and the direction of motion , and @xmath37 is along the line of sight .",
    "the individual factors of @xmath38 transform into the fluid rest frame as follows .    first , since @xmath36 is perpendicular to the direction of motion , it is not affected by relativity in any way , and @xmath39 .",
    "next , recall from ",
    "[ s : intro.worldsnap ] above that the transverse separation @xmath0 of two photon paths , i.e. , light rays , is lorentz - invariant . the transverse extent @xmath35 is defined by two such parallel light rays and therefore it is also lorentz - invariant , hence @xmath40 . finally , to determine the transformation properties of @xmath37 , consider the following argument",
    "the optical depth @xmath41 along @xmath37 has to be lorentz - invariant since it encodes the fraction @xmath42 of photons that are absorbed by the jet material , which is independent of the motion of any observer @xcite . by definition , the optical depth is @xmath43 where @xmath44 the absorption coefficient of the material .",
    "the lorentz invariance of @xmath41 therefore implies that @xmath37 transforms inversely to @xmath44 . from the lorentz invariance of @xmath45",
    "( again see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it follows that @xmath37 transforms as @xmath46 , i.e. , @xmath47 .",
    "hence @xmath48 , again yielding eq .",
    "( [ eq : vtrans ] ) .",
    "thus , the relation between rest - frame and observer - frame volume for supersnapshots is always given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : vtrans ] ) , no matter whether we are considering a `` jet '' , `` blob '' or even `` shock '' feature . as noted at the end of the preceding section , the well - known apparent difference between the beaming formulae for a blob and a jet ( @xmath49 versus @xmath50 , such as in app .",
    "c7 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is in fact just a difference of _ integrands _ ; since the _ integration boundaries _ differ depending on whether an object is considered as blob or jet , the final answer is independent of the assumed geometry . in other words , * jets and blobs have the same beaming properties if identical source volumes are considered*. the equivalence of jet and blob formulae will be shown explicitly in  [ s : beaming.jets.restframe ] and [ s : disc.bmin.obsfixed ] below .    while eq .",
    "( [ eq : vtrans ] ) appears straightforward to interpret , the supersnapshot is merely a projection of the observer - frame volume onto the plane of the sky , so that * the observer - frame volume @xmath38 is not a direct observable * ( see fig .  [",
    "f : ray_sph ] below ) .",
    "therefore , the volume formula can only be used for interpreting astronomical images if an assumption is made about the geometry of the source .",
    "however , its use in determining observables from known rest - frame quantities is straightforward .",
    "this section attempts to give an intuitive pictorial representation of how relativistic jets appear in supersnapshots .",
    "the first part considers jet observations as supersnapshots of infinitesimally thin relativistic rods .",
    "this approach is appropriate for demonstrating how the scale change in a supersnapshot , referred to below as _ retardation magnification _ , arises as spatial corollary to the well - known temporal phenomenon of apparent superluminal motion @xcite .",
    "the second part presents results from a ray - tracer that demonstrate the differences between world maps and world pictures .",
    "those effects are particularly important which arise from the extent of actual jets perpendicular to the direction of motion , as they results in extra light - travel delays between the near and far side of the jet that are not present in the case of an idealized , thin rod .",
    "consider a relativistically moving rod , i.e. , an object for which the light - travel time _ across _ its extent is negligible compared to that _ along _ its extent .",
    "the rod is subject to lorentz contraction , so that its rest - frame length @xmath51 is related to its length in the observer frame by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is inferred from a world - map analysis . for the interpretation of observations , where the observer is sufficiently distant from the moving rod to be able to take a _",
    "supersnapshot _ , we want to relate the apparent size of the object on the supersnapshot to its actual length in the world map . to clarify terminology ,",
    "the term `` projected size '' ( symbol @xmath54 ) will be used to mean the size that corresponds to the projected extent as measured on the supersnapshot , while the term `` apparent size '' ( @xmath55 ) is the size that is inferred from the projected size by deprojecting with the line - of - sight angle @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath56 . from the constancy and finite value of the speed of light ,",
    "@xmath57 where i have defined a magnification @xmath58 substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : ltrans ] ) recovers the well - known relation @xmath59 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "equivalently , @xmath60 not by coincidence , the projected velocity @xmath61 ( usually called `` apparent transverse velocity '' ) in apparent superluminal motion is related to the actual velocity @xmath62 by exactly the same magnification factor that relates the projected length to the actual length : @xmath63 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ltrans_mag ] ) , ( [ eq : ltrans_dproj ] ) and ( [ eq : ltrans_dproj_obs ] ) , we can read off all the relevant implications for the interpretation of supersnapshots :    1 .   for an approaching rod with @xmath64 , @xmath65 and therefore @xmath66 for any value of @xmath67 .",
    "thus , the _ apparent _ , deprojected length @xmath55 of a relativistic approaching object is always greater than its observer - frame length @xmath53 as inferred from a world map . in other words , * in a supersnapshot , any approaching relativistic object appears magnified compared to its actual observer - frame size*. only for @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , and the lorentz contraction of a thin rod becomes observable .",
    "the projected length @xmath54 is always less than or equal to the rest - frame length @xmath51 .",
    "the limiting case @xmath71 occurs for @xmath72 , which implies @xmath73 and @xmath74 . in this case",
    ", the `` projected '' appearance of the rod in a supersnapshot is identical to the view of an observer looking at the rod from 90  in its own rest frame , without any lorentz contraction .",
    "this fact was already derived at the end of  [ s : intro.worldsnap ] , there based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : sintrans ] ) .",
    "the second point implies that it is possible to constrain the orientation and speed of a moving relativistic object if its rest - frame size is known . in the case of jets",
    ", this may be possible if jet features are known to have a certain ratio of length to width , since the width is not affected by the beaming .",
    "figure  [ f : magnif ] gives a more intuitive illustration of why distant relativistic objects appear magnified in a supersnapshot compared to their true observer - frame extent .",
    "as in apparent superluminal motion , the cause of this effect is the time delay between light signals reaching the observer from the end of the object that is closest to the observer and those from the end of the object furthest from the observer .",
    "therefore , i call this effect",
    "_ retardation magnification_. in analogy to the first point above , any relativistic object s apparent velocity is _ always magnified _ compared to its true velocity , without necessarily appearing to be superluminal .      for astrophysical jets ,",
    "however , there is a catch : jets are produced by accretion disks around a compact object , and they terminate in a `` hot spot '' ( this can be a shock terminating an fr  ii jet , or a flaring point at which an fr  i jet decelerates substantially ) . both are moving through the observer frame much more slowly than the jet material itself .",
    "hence , the apparent size of any jet feature can not be larger than the separation between the core and the hot spot .",
    "thus , if jet features appear magnified , it means that not all of the features that are actually _ present _ in the observer frame can be _ visible simultaneously _ to the observer , as the total apparent length would then need to be larger than the actual separation between core and hot spot .",
    "hence , the magnification implies that parts of the jet are hidden from the observer s view .",
    "this retardation _ hiding _ occurs because light signals from the further end of the jet have not yet had time to reach the distant observer , even though they have already emerged from the core .",
    "as the object appears magnified by a factor @xmath75 , it follows that only a fraction @xmath76 of the object is visible ; since time delays are greater for the parts of the object that are further from the observer , the visible part of the jet is that closest to the observer , and the hidden part is that furthest from the observer .     between the observer s line of sight and the jet s direction of motion , for different lorentz factors @xmath77 as given .",
    "the visible fraction is the inverse of the magnification factor @xmath78 defined in the text .",
    "relativistic flux beaming affects the detectability of jets ; for @xmath79 , the visible fraction of a jet at the critical beaming angle @xmath80 is given by @xmath81 ; as the jet becomes significantly de - beamed for larger line - of sight angles , this is the maximum visible fraction of the jet material in a relativistic jet.,width=317 ]         figure  [ f : visfrac ] shows the visible fraction as function of lorentz factor and line - of - sight angle .",
    "figure [ f : angles ] illustrates which parts of a relativistic rod are visible to a distant observer .",
    "the relativity - textbook analogue would be a relativistic train emerging from one tunnel and disappearing into a second one .",
    "if the distance between the end of one tunnel and the beginning of the second one is sufficiently short , a distant observer looking at the train from a small angle to the train s direction of motion will observe fewer railway carriages between the two tunnels than actually fit between them as judged by observers creating a world map .",
    "the magnification obviously applies to blobs , as their outlines are at rest in the _ fluid _ frame .",
    "however , it also applies to individual fluid elements that make up a `` jet '' feature whose outline is at rest in the _ observer _ frame .",
    "hence , a given section of an approaching jet actually _ contains _ more fluid elements than are _",
    "visible _ simultaneously to an observer .",
    "this is another way of deriving that eq .",
    "( [ eq : vtrans ] ) is always the correct volume transformation for supersnapshots , even in the jet case .",
    "the discussion so far has dealt exclusively with 1-dimensional rods , with negligible light travel time in the direction transverse to the direction of motion compared to the light travel time along the direction of motion .",
    "this situation does not apply to features of real astrophysical jets , which have comparable extent along and across the direction of motion .",
    "the next section illustrates the effect of light - travel delays across a relativistically moving object .      to give a visual illustration of the difference between a world map and a supersnapshot , this section contains images of the same emitting regions , once in the world map view , identical to what would be seen if the speed of light was infinite , and once in a supersnapshot view , appropriate for astronomical observations .",
    "as just noted , the discussion in the preceding section applies directly to `` blob '' features , whose outline is at rest in the fluid frame , but also to individual fluid elements making up a `` jet '' feature , whose outline is at rest in the observer frame .",
    "the main difference between a blob and a jet for the ray - tracing images is that the _ outline _ of blobs experiences the magnification effects .",
    "by contrast , the outline of stationary jet features does not get magnified and behaves according to our intuition , which is formed by observing bodies moving at velocities much less than the speed of light .",
    "hence , this section concentrates on the aspect of how the observed ( projected ) and true geometry of objects in supersnapshots are related , including the question how to infer the volume of a relativistic object from a supersnapshot .    the discussion here and in the entire",
    "the paper is restricted to optically thin objects .",
    "the effects of relativistic beaming on flux measurements and quantities derived from them will be examined in the following section .",
    "figures [ f : ray_sph ] and [ f : ray_slab ] shows some simple ray - tracing pictures illustrating the difference between world map and supersnapshot for blobs , and the different projection properties for relativistically moving and stationary features .",
    "the following points about observations blobs or jets can be inferred from figs .",
    "[ f : ray_sph ] and [ f : ray_slab ] :    1 .",
    "as expected from @xcite , blobs that are spherical in their rest frame are always observed as spherical blobs , even though they are in fact lens - shaped in the observer frame ( due to the lorentz contraction along the direction of motion ) .",
    "they are still magnified in the supersnapshot , but the magnification is now _ along _ the line of sight ; this is why their observer - frame volume still scales as @xmath82 , even though their projected appearance is identical to their rest - frame appearance .",
    "2 .   the observed _ shape _ of spherical blobs is not affected by changes in the line - of - sight angle , and hence the doppler factor ; however , their _ spacing _ changes by a factor @xmath18 with respect to their rest - frame spacing , by @xmath75 with respect to their true observer - frame spacing , resulting in an observed projected spacing of @xmath83 times their true observer - frame spacing .",
    "thus , relativistic blobs ( and relativistic objects in general ) behave very unintuitive under changes of the observation angle  the closer the line - of - sight angle is to the critical angle given by @xmath74 to the direction of motion , the further they appear to be apart .",
    "3 .   by contrast",
    ", stationary spherical jet features behave as expected by our everyday intuition , with smaller projected spacings between individual features for smaller line - of - sight angles .",
    "the geometry of individual blobs ( spherical vs.  slab ) does not affect _ how many _ of the blobs are seen , or their total beamed luminosity , but it does affect how the _ projected appearance _ of individual blobs varies with line - of - sight angle .",
    "the figures do not consider moving shocks , features which are at rest neither in the frame of the observer nor in that of the fluid .",
    "however , their projected shape as function of doppler factor is identical to the projected shape of blobs , i.e. , it is governed by the shock s doppler factor @xmath19 .",
    "the fluid s emissivity in the observer frame , on the other hand , is governed by the fluid s doppler factor @xmath18 .",
    "beaming formulae have been given in numerous places in the literature .",
    "the usual approach is one that considers a _ fixed source volume _ and then determines the changes in the received flux density , surface brightness etc .",
    "resulting from changes in the doppler factor , i.e. , the line - of - sight angle and lorentz factor .",
    "however , in astronomical observations , it is not the _ source _ volume that is fixed , but the source s _ projected appearance _ in the supersnapshot . the fact that the source volume differs when deprojecting the observed appearance with different line - of - sight angles is not considered often in the beaming literature .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to restate the beaming prescriptions for both directions , inferring changing observables for fixed source properties , and changing source properties from fixed observables .",
    "as above , the equations assume optically thin , isotropic emission with a power - law emissivity @xmath20 that is constant within the emitting region .      in the case of a blob ,",
    "the pattern frame is identical with the fluid frame , so that @xmath84 and @xmath18 is the relevant doppler factor . to get observed quantities in terms of source parameters , we need to specify a geometry for the emission region .",
    "i consider simple spherical emission regions as well as `` slab''-shaped regions of either square or circular cross - section .",
    "the beamed total flux density of a blob is given by @xmath85 where emissivity and source volume are held fixed in the fluid rest frame .",
    "the beamed bolometric luminosity is obtained by integrating @xmath24 over the appropriate range of _ rest - frame _ frequencies , leading ( after substitution using eqs .",
    "[ eq : ldef ] and [ eq : nutrans ] ) to @xmath86 in general , the beaming properties of bolometric quantities are obtained from the frequency differentials by adding @xmath87 to the exponent of the doppler factor , and the exponent to the doppler factor of beamed bolometric quantities does not contain any spectral - shape parameter such as @xmath88 .      surface brightness beaming is important because the detectability of jet features in optical and radio observations is determined by their peak surface brightness , not by their total flux .",
    "the observed surface brightness is given by the rest - frame volume emissivity integrated along the observer s line of sight after rotation into the rest frame .",

    ", this is just the converse of the observers in @xmath157 measuring the length of an object at rest in @xmath156 and finding that the moving object has contracted .",
    "thus , observers in either frame can both observe that moving objects appear contracted to them _ and _ infer that something that is at rest in their own frame will appear contracted to observers in the other frame ; similarly , observers can observe clocks in the other frame run slow _ and _ infer that their own clocks will be observed to run slow by observers in the other frame .",
    "the important point is that the outcome of an experiment depends on _ which quantity is held fixed in which frame _ , and the correct interpretation of apparently contradictory results depends on being clear in the description of the experiment .",

    "<S> since the jet speeds can not be constrained well from observations , but are generally believed to be relativistic , physical quantities inferred from observables are commonly expressed in terms of the unknown beaming parameters : the bulk lorentz factor and the line - of - sight angle , usually in their combination as relativistic doppler factor . </S>",
    "<S> this paper aims to resolve the discrepancies existing in the literature about such `` de - beaming '' of derived quantities , in particular regarding the minimum - energy magnetic field estimate . </S>",
    "<S> the discrepancies arise because the distinction is not normally made between the case of a fixed source observed with different beaming parameters and the case where the source projection on the sky is held fixed . </S>",
    "<S> the former is usually considered , but it is the latter that corresponds to interpreting actual jet observations . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , attention is drawn to the fact that apparent superluminal motion has a spatial corollary , here called `` retardation magnification '' , which implies that most parts of a relativistic jet that are actually present in the observer s frame ( a `` world map '' in relativity terminology ) are in fact hidden on the observer s image ( the `` world picture '' in general , or `` supersnapshot '' in the special case of astronomy ) .    </S>",
