    "the limit is well respected in the coherent quasi - particle regime of transport but the limit is violated in the region @xmath225 .",

    "( [ eqn - fem ] ) shows that that the electronic viscosity is proportional to the scattering time , just like the electrical conductivity .",

    "we estimate @xmath264 @xcite and so for the mhz frequencies typically used in rus , the damping associated with a viscosity of order @xmath259 requires an oscillator q factor of order @xmath265 and so is unlikely to be observable .    recently ,",
    "several new approaches have been suggested to experimentally measure the viscosity of the electron fluid in a metallic crystal .",
    "forcella , zaanen , valentinis , and van der marel  @xcite considered electromagnetic properties of viscous charged fluids , finding signatures due to the viscosity such as negative refraction , a frequency dependent peak in the reflection coefficient , and a strong frequency dependence of the phase . however , they note that these effects may be difficult to observe for viscosities of the order of @xmath259 .",
    "tomadin , vignale , and polini  @xcite considered a two - dimensional electron fluid in a corbino disk device in the presence of an oscillating magnetic flux .",
    "they showed that the viscosity could be determined from the dc potential difference that arises between the inner and the outer edge of the disk . in particular , for viscosities of the order of @xmath259 the potential difference varied significantly oscillation frequencies in the mhz range .",
    "levitov and falkovich  @xcite recently considered the flow of an electron fluid in a micrometer scale channel in the hydrodynamic regime , where the electron - electron collision rate is much larger than the momentum relaxation rate .",
    "they found that when the viscosity to resistance ratio is sufficiently large viscous flow occurs producing vorticity and a negative nonlocal voltage .",
    "spatially resolved measurements of the voltage allow determination of the viscosity .",
    "torre , tomadin , geim , and polini  @xcite considered the electron liquid in graphene in the hydrodynamic regime and showed that the shear viscosity could be determined from measurements of non - local resistances in multi - terminal hall bar devices .",
    "although these proposals are promising for the two - dimensional electron fluids in graphene and semiconductor heterostructures fabrication of the relevant micron - scale devices may be particularly challenging for bad metals such as cuprates and organic charge transfer salts .",
