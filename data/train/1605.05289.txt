    "the heavy nuclei collisions at large hadron collider ( lhc ) and the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) experiments investigate the region of the qcd phase diagram at high temperatures .",
    "especially , after observing @xmath6 suppression in these heavy ion collision experiments , this is considered as a signal of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite and a wide range of studies focused on the heavy mesons ( for a brief review of theoretical research , see @xcite ) .",
    "these particles also have a significant importance in understanding the nature of the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry in dense media .",
    "the theoretical investigations of the physical observables of hadrons at finite temperature will help us in understanding their properties such as decay widths , coupling constants , production rates , decay constants , etc . in lhc and rhic experiments .",
    "comprehending the decay constants of the heavy mesons has a vital role in the studies of the strong decays of the heavy mesons , as well as in their electromagnetic structures and radiative decay widths @xcite .",
    "theoretical predictions of temperature - dependent hadronic quantities also will help us demystify hot and dense qcd matter .",
    "since hadrons are bound states which are formed beyond perturbative region , one needs to have non - perturbative methods to predict hadronic properties . because of the increasing amount of energies and luminosities in pb - pb collisions , the investigation of the strong interactions of the heavy mesons takes many colleagues attention @xcite . there exists a wide literature on the calculations of masses , decay constants or form factors of heavy mesons at vacuum using non - perturbative approaches @xcite .",
    "besides , temperature dependencies of masses and decay constants are studied extensively e.g. using the qcd sum rules .",
    "heavy vectors have also been studied at finite temperature with qcd sum rules , in addition using the maximum entropy method ( mem ) to extract the spectral function @xcite .",
    "the ads / qcd method is applied to the heavy mesons in hot and dense medium as well @xcite . a remarkable spectral change in charmonium around the critical temperature",
    "is shown in these references .",
    "however , the thermal behaviours of the hadronic form factors have been investigated rarely @xcite . in order to calculate the thermal strong form factors , one must have the meson masses and decay constants as functions of temperature .",
    "one of the motivations of this study is mainly to obtain these functions for future studies on thermal form factor calculations of the heavy mesons .    in the qcd sum rules approach @xcite the properties of heavy mesons",
    "are modified mostly through gluon condensates . in the thermal qcd sum rules",
    "@xcite , it is assumed that the quark - hadron duality and the operator product expansion ( ope ) remain valid up to a limited temperature , but the quark and the gluon condensates have new thermal expectation values because of the hadronic medium @xcite .    in this paper , the masses and the decay constants of heavy vector and axial vector quarkonia are re - calculated in the framework of the thermal qcd sum rules . these thermal mass and decay",
    "constant functions are needed for a future study on the strong form factors of heavy mesons at finite temperature .",
    "the originality of this study is the calculation of temperature - dependent masses and decay constants of vector and axial vector @xmath13 ground states .",
    "the observation of these mesons have not been reported yet , but theoretical calculations at @xmath14 such as relativistic @xcite and non - relativistic quark models @xcite , qcd lattice @xcite and qcd sum rules at vacuum @xcite have been conducted .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section , the thermal qcd sum rules for the masses and the leptonic decay constants of the related mesons are obtained using the two - point correlation functions and the operator product expansion . in section iii , the selected parameters , numerical predictions and the comparisons of the results with the previous studies are given .",
    "last section is devoted to the conclusion .",
    "in this section , the temperature - dependent version of the two - point correlation function is evaluated , @xmath15{\\rangle},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 denotes the time ordering operator on the product of the parameters in the brackets , @xmath17 is temperature , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the four coordinate and the four momentum vectors , @xmath20 is the isospin averaged interpolating current of the mesons :    @xmath21    @xmath22    the currents @xmath23 and @xmath24 interpolate the heavy vector and axial vector mesons , respectively .",
    "the thermal average of any operator @xmath25 is given as : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the qcd hamiltonian and @xmath28 is the inverse temperature . if the hadronic matter s reference frame is chosen at rest , lorentz invariance is broken down . hence , by using four velocity vector @xmath29 , the lorentz invariant parameters can be redefined . with these parameters ,",
    "the thermal correlation function is obtained . for the hadronic representation , the correlation function",
    "is saturated with the currents having the same quantum numbers of the related mesons .",
    "the qcd representation of the correlation function can be written via ope in terms of e.g. quark masses , quark and gluon condensates which represent the internal structure of the meson and quark - gluon - vacuum interactions . after equating these two different pictures of the correlation function ,",
    "the qcd sum rules are obtained .",
    "however , the higher states contribution should be suppressed and the borel transformation is the main concept for this suppression . as a result , for the hadronic representation :    @xmath30    where ( @xmath31 ) represents the excited states and the continuum , @xmath32 is the mass of the heavy meson .",
    "the matrix element which creates the meson current from the vacuum is defined in terms of decay constants and masses as :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the polarization vector .",
    "summation rule over polarization vectors is given as :    @xmath35    note that eqs .",
    "5 - 7 are also valid at finite temperature .",
    "after some algebraic operations , the thermal hadronic representation is obtained as :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are temperature - dependent decay constants and masses of the mesons , respectively .",
    "the qcd representation of the correlation function is obtained in deep euclidean region , @xmath39 , by using ope where the high energy and low energy regions are separated :    @xmath40             the perturbative part is represented by the bare loop diagram ( fig [ bare ] ) and is calculated in terms of a dispersion integral :    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the thermal spectral density . by using cutkosky s rule and after some straightforward algebra , the thermal spectral density is obtained as :    @xmath43 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath44 is the number of colors , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the valence quark masses of the related heavy meson .",

    "for the non - perturbative part , the quark condensate contributions are suppressed by the inverse powers of the quark masses . for the heavy - heavy mesons ,",
    "the quark condensate contributions are extremely weak and can be neglected .",
    "hence , the gluon condensates play the major role in the calculations and the non - perturbative contribution comes mainly from the two - gluon condensates which are shown in fig [ np ] .",
