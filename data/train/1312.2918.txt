    "monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmds ) comprise a new class of atomically thin semiconducting crystals in which electrons exhibit strong spin - valley coupling that results in novel valleytronic properties when interrogated with circularly polarized light @xcite .",
    "these include valley - selective photoexcitation @xcite , valley hall effect @xcite , valley - tunable magnetic moment @xcite , and valley - selective optical stark effect @xcite .",
    "unlike traditional semiconductors , the coulomb interaction in monolayer tmds is unusually strong because screening is greatly suppressed and spatial overlap of the interaction is much larger .",
    "this enhances the stability of a variety of excitonic quasiparticles with extremely large binding energies , including excitons @xcite , trions @xcite , and exciton - trion complexes @xcite .",
    "in addition to excitons and trions , monolayer tmds should also host biexcitons , van der waals quasiparticles formed from two neutral excitons bound by residual coulomb fields . moreover",
    ", the unique spin - valley coupling of these electrons , which also behave as massive dirac fermions at two different valleys ( fig 1a ) , offers an ideal system to form unique intervalley biexcitons @xcite that have two - dimensional positronium - molecular - like structure .",
    "apart from the large binding energies , they are also expected to show novel properties such as entanglement between the pair of valley pseudospins .",
    "thorough investigation of these properties is crucial to assess their potential use in applications .",
    "advanced experimental probes are needed to uncover these unique quasiparticles that can not be accessed by more conventional techniques .",
    "transient absorption spectroscopy is ideally suited to access intervalley biexciton states via two - step excitation ( fig 1b ) . in this experiment ,",
    "an ultrashort laser pulse is split into two portions : the first pulse ( pump ) is used to create a population of excitons , @xmath1 , and the second pulse ( probe ) is used to induce a second transition to form biexcitons , @xmath2 ( see appendix [ app : setup ] ) . in monolayer",
    "tmds , there are two degenerate valleys ( k and k@xmath3 ) where different excitons can be created using left ( @xmath4 ) and right ( @xmath5 ) circularly polarized light @xcite . in order to form intervalley biexcitons",
    ", we used a succession of pump and probe pulses with opposite helicities .",
    "the biexcitons are revealed as a pump - induced absorption of the probe pulse at energy slightly below the primary exciton absorption peaks .        in this article , we show that there are two intervalley biexciton species in monolayer tmd mos@xmath0 , which we identify as aa biexcitons and ab heterobiexcitons .",
    "we measure the binding energies of these biexcitons to be 60 mev and 40 mev , respectively .",
    "experiments using excess pump photon energy reveal the stability of the biexcitons at high temperatures .",
    "we also investigate the effect of high excitation densities on the excitons , which shows the presence of many - body effects in monolayer mos@xmath0 .",
    "the equilibrium absorption spectrum of monolayer mos@xmath0 , measured using differential reflectance microscopy at 10 k , consists of two exciton resonances ( @xmath6 ev and @xmath7 ev ) and a background from higher - energy states @xcite ( fig 1c ) . to create a population of excitons at the k valley , we used @xmath4 pump pulses with photon energy tuned near the a exciton resonance ( @xmath8 ev ) and fluence @xmath9 .",
    "further excitation to the intervalley biexciton state can be detected from induced absorption ( @xmath10 ) of @xmath5 probe pulses . in an ideal system with negligible scattering",
    ", one would also expect to see optical bleaching ( @xmath11 ) at the a exciton transition using @xmath4 probe pulses and no bleaching anywhere using @xmath5 probe pulses .",
    "fig 1d shows a pair of @xmath12 spectra measured using broadband probe pulses with helicities @xmath4 ( black ) and @xmath5 ( red ) at @xmath13 ps .",
    "this time delay was chosen to avoid contaminating effects of coherent light - matter interaction @xcite .",
    "in contrast to what is expected , we observed strong bleaching peaks not only at a but also at b exciton transitions , and strikingly , these two peaks were present in both spectra measured using different helicities @xcite .    the unexpected bleaching of the b exciton transition can only originate from electron state filling in the conduction band .",
    "this is because the pump photon energy is insufficient to excite holes to form a b exciton , and hole scattering between the a and b bands is very unlikely due to the large energy splitting ( 150 mev ) .",
    "meanwhile , the photoexcited electron spin - up state ( for a exciton ) at the k valley can exhibit an _",
    "spin reversal to occupy the electron spin - down state ( for b exciton ) .",
    "this process can be mediated by flexural phonons @xcite , and it can occur during the pump pulse duration ( appendix [ app : spin_reversal ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the bleaching peaks that are observed using the opposite probe helicity can be explained by _ intervalley _ scattering , which is expected to be very fast due to electron - hole exchange interaction in this material @xcite .",
    "in particular , valley excitons with finite in - plane momentum can have exchange interaction that generates an in - plane effective magnetic field , around which the exciton pseudospin precesses from k to k@xmath3 valley .",
    "calculations show that such valley depolarization can be as fast as tens to hundreds of fs @xcite , consistent with our observation .",

    "( b ) @xmath12 spectra at increasing time delays , showing the peak sharpening and the shifting to higher probing energy .",
    "( c ) time - traces of @xmath12 at probe energies as indicated by the colored dots in ( b).,scaledwidth=41.0% ]     ( red ) through the cooling process.,scaledwidth=41.0% ]    comparison of the two spectra in fig 1d shows that the red curve gains an appreciable offset in certain spectral ranges with respect to the black curve that , according to the pump - probe scheme in fig 1b , can be attributed to induced absorption to intervalley biexciton states . to isolate the biexciton contribution",
    ", we evaluate the difference between the two spectra ( fig 1e ) from which we extract the biexciton binding energies ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "we find peak energies of @xmath17 mev and @xmath18 mev , consistent with recently estimated values @xcite .",
    "since we only photoexcited the a excitons at resonant excitation , we expect the biexcitons to contain at least one a exciton .",
    "thus , by the proximity of the biexciton peaks in fig 1e to the exciton resonances , we deduce that the former is comprised of two a excitons ( aa biexcitons ) , while the latter consists of one a and one b exciton ( ab heterobiexcitons ) .",
    "the intervalley nature of these biexcitons is guaranteed from our measurement protocol , where we used pump and probe pulses with opposite helicities .",
    "additional contributions apart from the intervalley biexcitons are eliminated by taking the difference in @xmath12 spectra as shown in fig 1e . at later time delays , both @xmath12 spectra",
    "become nearly identical ( fig 1f ) because intervalley scattering establishes balance between the exciton populations at the two valleys .",
    "biexciton formation can then be induced from these excitons via absorption of probe pulses with either polarization ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) .",
    "we measured biexciton binding energies to be greater than the thermal energy at room temperature , @xmath19 mev .",
    "this is expected because the excitons in monolayer mos@xmath0 have large binding energies ( @xmath20 ) , with measured values reported from 440 mev @xcite to 570 mev @xcite . despite this variation in the reported values ,",
    "the obtained binding energies are consistent with theoretical models @xcite that predict @xmath21 ( 0.13@xmath220.23 ) @xmath20 in monolayer mos@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the large biexciton binding energies share the same origin as those of the excitons where , in the 2d limit , quantum confinement and suppressed screening greatly enhance the coulomb interaction in this system .",
    "we now turn to discuss the time evolution of biexciton formation upon photoexcitation using excess pump photon energy ( @xmath15 ev ) and exciton excitation density of @xmath23 @xmath24 . in this section , we measured the differential transmittance @xmath25 as a function of probe photon energy and time delay ( fig 2a ) .",
    "we plot the corresponding @xmath12 spectra at different time delays in fig 2b , expanded around the a exciton resonance .",
    "the induced absorption peak exhibits a gradual shift in energy from 1.83 ev at 0.6 ps to 1.88 ev at 14 ps , which is accompanied by a peak sharpening . to elucidate this behavior we plot , in fig 2c , the @xmath12 time - traces ( normalized ) between energies 1.78@xmath221.88 ev , as indicated by the colored dots in fig 2b .",
    "we find that the decay at 1.78 ev is accompanied by a buildup at 1.88 ev .",
    "the latter value is consistent with the peak position of the biexciton signature measured in the near resonant excitation .",
    "we interpret this observation as resulting from the exciton cooling process , where the energy distribution of the photoexcited excitons varies with the time delay , as depicted in fig 3 .",
    "in the first panel , we show the density of exciton states @xmath26 surrounding the a exciton resonance . in our experiment ,",
    "the non - resonant excitation by the pump pulse ( @xmath27 ) imparts an excess energy of @xmath28 ev per exciton .",
    "this leads to the immediate formation of a hot exciton gas ( @xmath29 k ) , where the population of highly energetic excitons @xmath30 at @xmath31 becomes substantial .",
    "this is shown on the second panel of fig 3 ( grey ) , including the associated @xmath12 spectra ( red ) .",
    "the biexciton energy can now be expressed as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the excess exciton energy whose distribution depends on @xmath34 .",
    "hence , we only need to create a probe exciton with energy lower than @xmath35 to form a biexciton of energy @xmath36 .",
    "this explains the low - energy tail of @xmath12 at @xmath37 ps ( fig 2b ) .",
    "moreover , the presence of biexciton absorption at such an early relaxation stage of the hot exciton gas shows that they are stable at high temperatures . at later time delays ( fig 3 , right panels ) , the highly energetic excitons gradually relax into the lowest state , via releasing energy to the lattice and the substrate , to form a cold exciton gas . during this process",
    ", the @xmath12 spectral weight ( red ) at lower energy gradually climbs to higher energy , consistent with the observed dynamics in fig 2c and the @xmath12 peak shifting and sharpening in fig 2b .",
    "( b ) transient absorption spectra as extracted from ( a ) , showing the red - shift of the exciton peaks due to many - body effects .",
    "( c ) energy shift at densities @xmath38 , scaled by the exciton size.,scaledwidth=41.0% ]      we have shown that the biexciton binding energies in monolayer mos@xmath0 are rather large , rendering biexcitons stable against thermal disintegration above room temperature .",
    "this finding results from the strong , long - range coulomb interaction in this material , which also causes many - body effects to play a significant role at higher excitation densities .",
    "the interactions introduced by photoexcited carriers often result in an exciton energy shift @xcite , which can be used as a sensitive indicator of many - body correlations . to investigate these effects , we measured a series of @xmath12 spectra at increasing excitation densities using pump photon energy 3.16 ev ( fig 4a ) .",
    "the 4 ps time delay was chosen to guarantee that all excitations relaxed to the lowest excited state ( a exciton ) and that these excitons reached a quasi - equilibrium temperature shared by the lattice and the substrate .",
    "these @xmath12 spectra were added to the measured equilibrium absorption spectrum @xmath39 , yielding the transient absorption spectra shown in fig 4b .",
    "as the excitation density is increased , the exciton absorption peak shifts to lower energies and develops a low - energy shoulder .",
    "the shoulder corresponds to biexciton formation , as discussed above , while the peak - shift results from many - body interactions , consistent with a recent theoretical study @xcite .",
    "these peak - shifts can be as large as 30 mev ( a ) and 50 mev ( b ) at a density of @xmath40 @xmath24 , with no additional shift up to @xmath41 @xmath24 .    in general ,",
    "the energy shift is a result of complex many - body interactions , a well - known problem in condensed matter physics that requires synergistic investigation from first - principle calculations and experiments .",
    "as anticipated in highly excited semiconductors , photoexcited carriers introduce additional screening and modify exchange - correlation energies @xcite .",
    "renormalization of the electronic structure gives rise to the reduction of both the band gap and the exciton binding energy .",
    "incomplete compensation of the two effects often results in a net energy shift of the exciton peak .",
    "the behavior , at which the energy shift varies as a function of exciton density , can be studied to determine the detailed contributions from different interaction terms .",
    "we examined our results by rescaling the energy shift ( @xmath42 ) and the time - delayed density ( @xmath43 ) into dimensionless parameters ( appendix [ app : manybody ] ) .",
    "we found that in the low - density regime they follow a simple formula ( fig 4c ) @xmath44 where @xmath20 ( @xmath45 mev @xcite ) is the exciton binding energy , @xmath46 ( @xmath47 nm @xcite ) is the exciton bohr radius , and @xmath48 is a dimensionless factor .",
    "we found that the experimental results are best fitted with @xmath49 , while fits using other exponents are relatively poor ( appendix [ app : manybody ] ) . by fitting the first seven data points with @xmath49",
    ", we obtained @xmath50 and @xmath51 , while the remaining data points deviate from linear behavior .",
    "equation ( 2 ) shows that @xmath42 obeys a power - law behavior with density , until the inter - exciton distance ( @xmath52 ) approaches the exciton bohr radius , where the mott transition is expected @xcite . in this extreme situation ,",
    "the electron is in a frustrated state where it can not distinguish which hole belongs to its exciton pair , thus the system has a tendency to become metallic .",
    "this power - law behavior at low - density regime can be perceived in a physically intuitive picture from its exponent .",
    "we note that the measured energy shift ( @xmath53 ) is the energy gain for each exciton in the presence of collective photoexcited excitons , as compared to the energy of an isolated exciton . if @xmath54 , the energy gain is inversely proportional to the mean inter - exciton distance ( @xmath52 ) where short - range interaction dominates . if @xmath55 , the energy gain is proportional to the number of surrounding excitons per unit area ( @xmath43 ) , where long - range interaction dominates .",
    "these two scenarios have subtle differences in determining the major contributions to the energy shift , for which first - principle calculations can be helpful @xcite .",
    "the obtained relation @xmath56 shows that the exciton interactions in monolayer tmds fall in between the two scenarios where both short- and long - range interactions are comparable , even in the low - density regime .",
    "by using transient absorption spectroscopy we have observed intervalley biexcitons in monolayer mos@xmath0 , measured their binding energies , and monitored their relaxation processes .",
    "studying intervalley biexcitons could offer a new concept of quasiparticles in solids where valley - pseudospin states play significant roles , apart from the usual atom - like orbital and spin states .",
    "the large biexciton binding energies in this material offer a promising direction to search for higher - order bound excitons such as triexcitons and the elusive quadexcitons @xcite as well as their interplay with spin - valley degrees of freedom .",
    "we also found that , while two excitons can interact and form a biexciton , the interactions between _ free _ excitons in this system reveal a large energy red - shift that obeys a simple power - law behavior with density .",
    "this experimentally obtained relation between the energy shift and the density , as well as the obtained biexciton binding energies , should be used to aid future theoretical works and additional experiments in exploring many - body physics in atomically thin materials . _",

    "in our experiments , we used a ti : sapphire regenerative amplifier producing laser pulses at 30 khz , with center wavelength 785 nm and duration 50 fs fwhm .",

    "the pulses were frequency - converted using an optical parametric amplifier ( for resonant excitation ) or a second - harmonic crystal ( for non - resonant excitation ) , and then chopped at 7.5 khz . for the probe arm , the pulses were sent through a delay stage and a white - light continuum generator ( @xmath57 1.78@xmath222.48 ev , chirp - corrected ) .",
    "the two beams were focused onto the sample with ( pump ) and ( probe ) fwhm diameters .",

    "high - quality monolayers of mos@xmath0 were cvd - grown on a sapphire substrate @xcite and mounted inside a cold - finger cryostat with temperature of 10 k for all measurements in this study .",

    "this gives the differential reflectance @xmath58 as a function of energy and time delay , from which we can obtain the transient reflectance , @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the reflectance of the system in equilibrium .",
    "in fact , the absorptance @xmath62 ( or the induced absorptance @xmath12 ) is what we really want because it provides the explicit information about the optical transition matrix element of the system .",
    "the absorptance and the reflectance are related through the complex dielectric function @xmath63 ; this relation can be derived using maxwell equations @xcite .",
    "we obtain @xmath64 by fitting @xmath65 using a kramers - kronig ( kk ) constrained variational analysis @xcite . finally , we construct @xmath66 by repeating this procedure at different time delays .",

    "first , we want to find the relation between the complex dielectric function and the optical properties such as reflectance , transmittance and absorptance by using maxwell s equations .",
    "note that it is important to include the substrate influence on electromagnetic radiation especially for atomically - thin materials @xcite . here",
    ", the current density in a monolayer mos@xmath0 sample is described by a delta function , @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the complex conductivity and @xmath69 is the @xmath70-component of the probe electric field ( along the sample s surface ) . by substituting this into maxwell s equations and using the appropriate boundary conditions between the monolayer and the substrate ,",
    "we can obtain the reflectance as @xmath71 and the transmittance as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the substrate s refractive index ( 1.7675 for sapphire at photon energy of 2.07 ev ) , @xmath74 is the effective thickness of the monolayer ( 0.67 nm @xcite ) , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function , respectively . here",
    ", the 2d dielectric function is expressed as @xmath77 meanwhile , the absorptance can be expressed as @xmath78 these expressions are exact , and they are valid for any monolayer materials on a dielectric substrate .",
    "we find that the presence of the substrate significantly influences the optical properties of the monolayer mos@xmath0 above it .",
    "as compared to an isolated monolayer mos@xmath0 , the reflectance is enhanced , while both the transmittance and the absorptance are reduced . in graphene , the above expressions can be further simplified because the real part of its dielectric function is featureless in the visible spectrum ( @xmath79 , negligible @xmath80 @xcite ) .",
    "this is , however , not the case for monolayer mos@xmath0 , and we must include both the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function to obtain accurate results .    in our analysis , we used the equilibrium absorptance @xmath62 of monolayer mos@xmath0 that is measured using differential reflectance microscopy ( fig 1c , main text ) .",
    "the absorptance spectrum contains peaks from the a exciton at 1.93 ev and from the b exciton at 2.08 ev .",
    "the equilibrium reflectance @xmath61 can then be constructed from @xmath62 by finding the appropriate complex dielectric function @xmath63 as expressed in equations ( [ eqnr ] ) and ( [ eqna ] ) . to do this",
    ", we implemented a kramers - kronig ( kk ) constrained variational analysis @xcite to extract @xmath63 from the measured @xmath62 . here , the total dielectric function is constructed by many drude - lorentz oscillators , which are anchored at equidistant energy spacing , in the following form @xmath81 in our calculations , we used @xmath82 oscillators with a fixed linewidth of @xmath83 mev spanning the energy range of 1.77 ev @xmath84 2.40 ev , and we found that these parameters can fit the absorptance spectrum well",
    ". we can then construct @xmath61 spectrum by using @xmath63 obtained from the above analysis .",
    "the transient absorptance spectra @xmath85 can be obtained by performing similar ( kk ) analysis .",
    "this time we inferred the absorptance from the reflectance at different time delays : @xmath86 , where the differential reflectance @xmath87 is measured directly from the experiments . similar procedure also applies to the transmission geometry .",
    "in order to understand the bleaching of b exciton transition , we note that at the k valley the electron states in the conduction band are split by the spin - orbit coupling into two spin states , where the electron spin - up state ( for a exciton ) is 3 mev lower in energy than the electron spin - down state ( for b exciton ) @xcite .",
    "these two states preserve the good spin quantum numbers ( out of plane ) due to the @xmath88 mirror symmetry of the lattice .",
    "resonant excitation of the a exciton using @xmath4 pump pulses only populates the electron spin - up state at k valley ( see fig 1a ) , and should in principle not bleach the b exciton transition .",
    "hence , the observed bleaching of b exciton can only be explained by the electron spin reversal in the conduction band that immediately occurs during the pump pulse duration ( 160 fs ) . in this flexible material , intravalley",
    "electron spin reversal can be mediated by flexural phonons in the realm of elliott - yafet spin - flip mechanism @xcite .",
    "spin - flip transition is allowed in the scattering via long - wavelength in - plane optical phonon and out - of - plane acoustic phonon , for which the respective deformation potentials are even and odd with respect to mirror symmetry .",
    "because of the small spin - splitting in the conduction band , the strong spin - orbit coupling and the flexible lattice structure , the spin lifetime could be as short as 50 fs for suspended monolayer mos@xmath0 at room temperature .",
    "supporting the membrane with sapphire substrate at 10 k can in principle prolong the spin lifetime @xcite but substrate roughness , domain boundaries and impurities could conversely increase the rate of carrier collisions that will enhance the spin - reversal scattering rate .",
    "the fast electron spin reversal could thus explain the b exciton bleaching shown in fig 1d .",
    "the pump and probe pulses were focused at the sample to and fwhm , respectively , within which 50% of the energy per pulse is contained .",
    "we are interested in finding the effective pump fluence that is sampled by the probe pulse , with area of only one - third of the pump diameter ( 7.5% of the energy ) .",
    "for instance , a total pump power of 1 mw ( 30 khz ) measured at the sample position gives an effective pump fluence of /cm@xmath9 within the probed area .",
    "the interference from the substrate further reduces the pump intensity to @xmath90 where the refractive index of the sapphire substrate at 3.16 ev photon energy is @xmath91 .",
    "the absorptance of suspended monolayer mos@xmath0 at 3.16 ev photon energy was measured to be around 25% @xcite . finally , by taking all of the above considerations into account",
    ", we can estimate the e - h excitation density as @xmath92 pump intensity variations due to the spatially - varying ( gaussian ) profile and the pulse - to - pulse power fluctuation contribute to the fluence uncertainty . with these considerations",
    ", we estimated the fluence variation of less than @xmath93 in our experiments .",
    "in order to obtain an accurate behavior of the energy shift , the exciton density must be carefully determined .",
    "we note that the absorptance spectra were measured at time delay of 4 ps after photoexcitation .",
    "this means the actual exciton density ( @xmath43 ) may be slightly smaller than the excitation density ( @xmath94 ) . during this process , exciton - exciton annihilation could happen with a decay rate that depends on the initial excitation density , as studied by sun _",
    "_ @xcite and kumar _",
    "we incorporated this process in our analysis , and used the obtained time - delayed density @xmath95 in our main text @xmath96 where @xmath94 is the initial photoexcited exciton density , @xmath97 ( @xmath98 , @xcite ) is the exciton - exciton annihilation rate , and @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ps ) is the time - delay after photoexcitation .",
    "in order to get a better physical picture , we scaled the density @xmath95 with the exciton bohr radius @xmath46 into a dimensionless density @xmath101 . in this way , we can think of the excitons as rigid bodies and determine the critical density ( @xmath102 ) at which the excitons are closely packed .",
    "we plot the power - law dependence of the energy shift @xmath42 as a function of dimensionless density @xmath105 where @xmath20 ( @xmath45 mev , @xcite ) is the exciton binding energy , @xmath48 is a dimensionless factor , and @xmath106 is the exponent .",
    "we also performed an uncertainty analysis to determine the horizontal error - bars of every data points using the quadratic - sum method which yields a fractional uncertainty of @xmath107 where @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) is the laser fluence fluctuation and @xmath110 ( @xmath111 , @xcite ) is the standard deviation of the exciton - exciton annihilation rate .    in order to determine the correct power - law behavior , we plot the results with three different exponents of @xmath112 and make a comparison through a linear fitting of the first seven data points ( fig e1 ) . by using least - square method to fit equation ( 9 ) with the measured data",

    "<S> these biexcitons comprise two excitons from different valleys , which are distinct from biexcitons in conventional semiconductors and have no direct analogue in atomic and molecular systems . however , their valley properties are not accessible to traditional transport and optical measurements . here , we report the observation of intervalley biexcitons in the monolayer tmd mos@xmath0 using ultrafast pump - probe spectroscopy . by applying broadband probe pulses with different helicities , </S>",
    "<S> we identify two species of intervalley biexcitons with large binding energies of 60 mev and 40 mev . in addition </S>",
    "<S> , we also reveal effects beyond biexcitonic pairwise interactions in which the exciton energy redshifts at increasing exciton densities , indicating the presence of many - body interactions among them . </S>"
