    "in the classical knot theory by a link one means a smooth closed 1-dimensional submanifold of the 3-dimensional sphere @xmath0 , i.  e. several disjoint circles smoothly embedded into @xmath0 .",
    "a classical link may emerge as the set of real points of a real algebraic curve .",
    "first , it gives rise to questions about relations between invariants of the same curve which are provided by link theory and algebraic geometry .",
    "second , it suggests to develop a theory parallel to the classical link theory , but taking into account the algebraic nature of objects . from this viewpoint",
    "it is more natural to consider real algebraic links up to isotopy consisting of real algebraic links , which belong to the same continuous family of algebraic curves , rather than up to smooth isotopy in the class of classical links .",
    "i call an isotopy of the former kind a _ rigid isotopy _ following a terminology established by rokhlin @xcite in a similar study of real algebraic plane projective curves and extended later to various other situations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "of course , there is a forgetting functor : any real algebraic link can be considered as a classical link and a rigid isotopy as a smooth isotopy .",
    "it is interesting , how much is lost under this transition .    in this note",
    "i point out a characteristic of a real algebraic link which is lost .",
    "it is unexpectedly simple . in an obvious sense it is a nontrivial vassiliev invariant of degree 1 on the class of real algebraic knots . in the classical knot theory",
    "the lowest degree of a nontrivial vassiliev knot invariant is 2 .",
    "thus there is an essential difference between classical knot theory and the theory of real algebraic knots .",
    "the characteristic of real algebraic links which is defined below is very similar to self - linking number of framed knots .",
    "i call it also _ self - linking number .",
    "_ its definition looks like a refinement of an elementary definition of the writhe of a knot diagram , but taking into consideration the imaginary part of the knot .",
    "in the classical theory , a self - linking number of a knot is defined only if the knot is equipped with an additional structure like framing or just a vector field nowhere tangent to the knot .",
    "the self - linking number is the linking number of the knot oriented somehow and its copy obtained by a small shift in the direction specified by the vector field .",
    "it does not depend on the choice of orientation , since reversing the orientation of the knot is compensated by reversing the induced orientation of its shifted copy . of course , it depends on the homotopy class of the vector field .",
    "a knot has no natural preferable homotopy class of framings which would allow to speak about a self - linking number of the knot without a special care on choice of a framing .",
    "some framings appear naturally in geometric situations .",
    "for example , if one fixes a generic projection of a knot to a plane , the vector field of directions of the projection appears .",
    "the corresponding self - linking number is called the _ writhe _ of the knot . however , it depends on the choice of projection and changes under isotopy .",
    "the linking number is a vassiliev invariant of order 1 of two - component oriented links .",
    "that means that it changes by a constant ( in fact , by 2 ) when the link experiences a homotopy with a generic appearance of an intersection point of the components . whether the linking number increases or decreases depends only on the local picture of orientations near the double point : when it passes from @xmath1 through @xmath2 to @xmath3 , the linking number increases by 2 .",
    "generalities on vassiliev invariants see , e.  g. , in @xcite    in a sense the linking number is the only vassiliev invariant of degree 1 of two - component oriented links : any vassiliev invariant of degree 1 of two - component oriented links is a linear function of the linking number .",
    "similarly , the self - linking number is a vassiliev invariant of degree 1 of framed knots ( it changes by 2 when the knot experiences a homotopy with a generic appearance of a self - intersection point ) and it is the only vassiliev of degree 1 of framed knots in the same sense .",
    "necessity of framing for definition of self - linking number can be formulated now more rigorously : only constants are vassiliev invariants of degree 1 of ( nonframed ) knots .",
    "the definition of the writhe , which is mimicked below , runs as follows : for each crossing point of the knot projection one defines a _ local writhe _ equal to @xmath4 if near the point the knot diagram looks like @xmath3 and @xmath5 if it looks like @xmath1 .",
    "then one sums up the local writhes over all double points of the projection .",
    "the sum is the writhe .",
    "a continuous change of the projection may cause vanishing of a crossing point .",
    "it happens under the first reidemeister move shown in the left hand half of figure [ f1 ] .",
    "this move changes the writhe by @xmath6 .",
    "if a link is algebraic then its projection to a plane is algebraic , too .",
    "a generic projection has only ordinary double points .",
    "the total number of complex double points is constant .",
    "the number of real double points can change , but only by an even number .",
    "a real double point can not turn alone into imaginary one , as it seems happen under the first reidemeister move . under the algebraic version of the first reidemeister move the double point stays in the real domain , but becomes solitary , like the only real point of the curve @xmath7 . the algebraic version of the first reidemeister move is shown in the right hand half of figure [ f1 ] .",
    "it is not difficult to prove that the corresponding family of plane curves can be transformed by a local diffeomorphism to the family of real rational cubic curves @xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "a solitary double point of the projection is not image of any real point of the link .",
    "it is the image of two imaginary complex conjugate points of the complexification of the link .",
    "the preimage of the point in the 3-space under the projection is a real line .",
    "it is disjoint from the real part of the link , but intersects its complexification in a couple of complex conjugate imaginary points .    in the next section with any solitary double point of the projection , a local writhe equal to @xmath10",
    "is associated .",
    "it is done in such a way that the local writhe of the crossing point vanishing in the first reidemeister move is equal to the local writhe of the borning solitary double point . in the case of an algebraic knot",
    "the sum of local writhes of all double points , both solitary and crossings , does not depend on the choice of projection and is invariant under rigid isotopy .",
    "this sum is the self - linking number .",
    "there are two types of generic deformations of an algebraic link changing the rigid isotopy type .",
    "one of them is exactly as in the category of classical links : two pieces of the set of real points come to each other and pass through each other . a generic projection of the link experiences an isotopy .",
    "no events happen besides that one crossing point becomes for a moment the image of a double point of the link and then turns back into a crossing point , but with the opposite writhe .",
    "another type has no counter - part in the topological context .",
    "two complex conjugate imaginary branches pass through each other .",
    "at the moment of passing they intersect in a real isolated double point . a generic projection of the link experiences an isotopy .",
    "no events happen besides that one solitary double point becomes for a moment the image of an isolated double point of the link and then turns back into a usual solitary double point , but with the opposite writhe .",
    "it is clear that the self - linking number of an algebraic knot changes under both modifications by @xmath11 with the sign depending only on the local structure of the modification near the double point .",
    "it means that the self - linking number is the vassiliev invariant of degree 1 .",
    "a construction similar to the construction of the self - linking number of an algebraic knot can be applied to algebraic _ links .",
    "_ however in this case it is necessary either to orient the link or to exclude from the sum the crossings where the branches belong to distinct components of the set of real points .",
    "in fact , the local writhe depends on the orientations of the branches , but if the branches belong to the same component orientations of the branches can be induced from the same orientation of the component .",
    "it is easy to see that the result does not depend on the choice of orientation of the component .    in the case of knots ,",
    "self - linking number defines a natural class of framings , since for knots homotopy classes of framings are enumerated by their self - linking numbers and we can choose the framing having the self - linking number equal to the algebraic self - linking number constructed here .",
    "i do not know any direct construction of this framing .",
    "moreover , there seems to be a reason for absence of such a construction . in the case of links the construction above gives a single number , while framings are enumerated by sequences of numbers with entries corresponding to components .",
    "the construction of this paper can be applied to algebraic links in the sphere @xmath0 .",
    "although from the viewpoint of knot theory this is the most classical case , from the viewpoint of algebraic geometry the case of curves in the projective space is simpler , and i will start from it .",
    "the case of spherical links is postponed to the section [ srs ] .",
    "let @xmath12 be a nonsingular real algebraic curve in the 3-dimensional projective space .",
    "then the set @xmath13 of its real points is a smooth closed 1-dimensional submanifold of @xmath14 , i.  e. a smooth projective link .",
    "the set @xmath15 of its complex points is a smooth complex 1-dimensional submanifold of @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath17 be a point of @xmath14 .",
    "consider the projection @xmath18 from @xmath17 .",
    "assume that @xmath17 is such that the restriction to @xmath15 of @xmath19 is generic .",
    "this means that it is an immersion without triple points and at each double point the images of the branches have distinct tangent lines .",
    "as it follows from well - known theorems , those @xmath17 s for which this is the case form an open dense subset of @xmath14 ( in fact , it is the complement of a 2-dimensional subvariety ) .",
    "the real part @xmath20 of the image consists of the image @xmath21 of the real part and , maybe , several solitary points , which are double points of @xmath22 .",
    "there is a purely topological construction which assigns a local writhe equal to @xmath10 to a crossing belonging to the image of only one component of @xmath13 .",
    "this construction is well - known in the case of classical knots .",
    "here is its projective version .",
    "i borrow it from drobotukhina s paper @xcite on generalization of kauffman brackets to links in the projective space .",
    "let @xmath23 be a smooth connected one - dimensional submanifold of @xmath14 , and @xmath17 be a point of @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath25 be a generic double point of the projection @xmath26 and @xmath27 be the line which is the preimage of @xmath25 under the projection .",
    "denote by @xmath28 and @xmath29 the points of @xmath30 .",
    "the points @xmath28 and @xmath29 divides the line @xmath31 into two segments .",
    "choose one of them and denote it by @xmath32 .",
    "choose an orientation of @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath33 and @xmath34 be tangent vectors of @xmath23 at @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively directed along the selected orientation of @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath35 be a vector tangent to @xmath31 at @xmath28 and directed inside @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath36 be a vector at @xmath28 such that it is tangent to the plane containing @xmath31 and @xmath34 and is directed to the same side of @xmath32 as @xmath34 ( in an affine part of the plane containing @xmath32 and @xmath34 ) .",
    "see figure [ f2 ] .",
    "the triple @xmath33 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 is a base of the tangent space @xmath37 .",
    "the value taken by the orientation of @xmath14 on this frame is the local writhe of @xmath25 .",
    "its definition involves several choices .",
    "however it is easy to prove that the result does not depend on them .",
    "let @xmath12 , @xmath17 and @xmath19 be as in the beginning of this section and let @xmath38 be a solitary double point of @xmath19 .",
    "here is a construction assigning @xmath10 to @xmath39 .",
    "i will call the result also a _ local writhe _ at @xmath39 .",
    "denote the preimage of @xmath39 under @xmath19 by @xmath31 .",
    "this is a real line in @xmath14 connecting @xmath17 and @xmath39 .",
    "it intersects @xmath15 in two imaginary complex conjugate points , say , @xmath28 and @xmath29 . since @xmath28 and @xmath29 are conjugate they belong to different components of @xmath40 .",
    "choose one of the common points of @xmath15 and @xmath41 , say , @xmath28 .",
    "the natural orientation of the component of @xmath40 defined by the complex structure of @xmath41 induces orientation on @xmath42 as on the boundary of its closure .",
    "the image under @xmath19 of the local branch of @xmath15 passing through @xmath28 intersects the plane of the projection @xmath43 transversally at @xmath39 .",
    "take the local orientation of the plane of projection such that the local intersection number of the plane and the image of the branch of @xmath15 is @xmath4 .",
    "thus the choice of one of two points of @xmath44 defines an orientation of @xmath42 and a local orientation of the plane of projection @xmath43 ( we can speak only on a local orientation of @xmath43 , since the whole @xmath43 is not orientable ) .",
    "the plane of projection intersects . if you would like to think on it as on the set of lines of @xmath14 passing through @xmath17 , please , identify it in a natural way with any real projective plane contained in @xmath14 and disjoint from @xmath17 .",
    "all such embeddings @xmath45 are isotopic . ]",
    "transversally @xmath42 in @xmath39 .",
    "the local orientation of the plane , orientation of @xmath42 and the orientation of the ambient @xmath14 determine the intersection number .",
    "this is the local writhe .",
    "it does not depend on the choice of @xmath28 .",
    "indeed , if one chose @xmath29 instead , then both the orientation of @xmath42 and the local orientation of @xmath43 would be reversed .",
    "the orientation of @xmath46 would be reversed , because @xmath42 receives opposite orientations from different halves of @xmath40 .",
    "the local orientation of @xmath43 would be reversed , because the complex conjugation involution @xmath47 preserves the complex orientation of @xmath48 , preserves @xmath43 ( point - wise ) and maps one of the branches of @xmath22 at @xmath39 to the other reversing its complex orientation .",
    "now for any real algebraic projective link @xmath12 choose a point @xmath49 such that the projection of @xmath12 from @xmath17 is generic and sum up writhes at all crossing points of the projection belonging to image of only one component of @xmath13 and writhes of all solitary double points .",
    "the sum is called the _ self - linking number of @xmath12 . _    it does not depend on the choice of projection",
    ". moreover it is invariant under _ rigid isotopy _ of @xmath12 . by rigid isotopy we mean an isotopy made of nonsingular real algebraic curves .",
    "the effect of a movement of @xmath17 on the projection can be achieved by a rigid isotopy defined by a path in the group of projective transformations of @xmath14",
    ". therefore the following theorem implies both independence of the self - linking number on the choice of projection and its invariance under rigid isotopy .",
    "[ mainth ] for any two rigidly isotopic real algebraic projective links @xmath50 and @xmath51 such that their projections from the same point @xmath49 are generic , the self - linking numbers of @xmath50 and @xmath51 defined via @xmath17 are equal .",
    "to prove this statement , first replace any rigid isotopy by a generic one . as in purely topological",
    "situation of classical links , any generic rigid isotopy may be decomposed to a composition of rigid isotopies , each of which makes a local standard move of the projection .",
    "there are 5 local standard moves .",
    "they are similar to the reidemeister moves .",
    "the first of these 5 moves is shown in the right hand half of figure [ f1 ] .",
    "the next two coincide with the second and third reidemeister moves .",
    "the fourth move is similar to the second reidemeister move : also two double points of projection come to each other and disappear .",
    "however the double points are solitary .",
    "the fifth move is similar to the third reidemeister move : also a triple point appears for a moment .",
    "but at this triple point only one branch is real , the other two are imaginary conjugate to each other . in this move a solitary double point traverses a real branch .    only in the first , fourth and fifth moves solitary double points are involved .",
    "the invariance under the second and the third move follows from well - known fact of knot theory that the topological writhe is invariant under the second and third reidemeister moves .",
    "thus we have to prove that :    1 .   in the first move the writhe of vanishing crossing point",
    "is equal to the writhe of the borning solitary point , 2 .   in the fourth move the writhes of the vanishing solitary points",
    "are opposite and 3 .   in the fifth move",
    "the writhe of the solitary point does not change .",
    "the proof is not complicated , but would take room inappropriate in this short note .    the same construction may be applied to real algebraic curves in @xmath14 having singular imaginary points , but no real singularities . in the construction we can avoid usage of projections from the points such that some singular point is projected from it to a real point . indeed , for any imaginary point there exists only one real line passing through it ( the line connecting the point with its complex conjugate ) , thus we have to exclude a finite number of real lines .",
    "the three - dimensional sphere @xmath0 is a real algebraic variety .",
    "it is a quadric in the four - dimensional real affine space .",
    "a stereographic projection is a birational isomorphism of @xmath0 onto @xmath14 .",
    "it defines a diffeomorphism between the complement of the center of projection in @xmath0 and a real affine space .",
    "given a real algebraic link in @xmath0 , one may choose a real point of @xmath0 from the complement of the link and project the link from this point to an affine space .",
    "then include the affine space into the projective space and apply the construction above .",
    "the image has no real singular points , therefore we can use the remark from the end of the previous section .",
    "it is difficult to survey all possible generalizations . here",
    "i indicate only two directions .    first , consider the most straightforward generalization .",
    "let @xmath31 be a nonsingular real algebraic @xmath52-dimensional subvariety in the projective space of dimension @xmath53 .",
    "its generic projection to @xmath54 has only ordinary double points . at each double point",
    "either both branches of image are real or they are imaginary complex conjugate . if set of real points is orientable then one can repeat everything from section [ s0 ] with obvious changes and obtain a definition of a numeric invariant generalizing the self - linking number defined in section [ s0 ] .",
    "let @xmath55 be a nonsingular three - dimensional real algebraic variety with oriented set of real points equipped with a real algebraic fibration over a real algebraic surface @xmath56 with fiber a projective line .",
    "there is a construction which assigns to a real algebraic link ( i.  e. , a nonsingular real algebraic curve in @xmath55 ) with a generic projection to @xmath56 an integer , which is invariant under rigid isotopy , multiplied by @xmath5 under reversing of the orientation of @xmath55 and is a vassiliev invariant of degree 1 .",
    "this construction is similar to that of section [ s0 ] , but uses , instead of projection to @xmath43 , an algebraic version of turaev s shadow descriptions of links @xcite .",
