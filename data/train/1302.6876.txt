    "double - beta decay was originally proposed by goeppert - mayer in 1935 @xcite as a nuclear disintegration with simultaneous emission of two electrons and two neutrinos @xmath6    there are several double - beta decay processes : @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 @xmath10 , 2@xmath9 and decay modes : two - neutrino ( 2@xmath5 ) , neutrinoless ( 0@xmath5 ) and majoron emission ( @xmath11 ) @xmath12 the 2@xmath5-mode is not prohibited by any conservation law and definitely occurs as a second - order process compared with regular @xmath0-decay @xcite .",
    "the 0@xmath5-mode differs from the 2@xmath5-mode in that only electrons are emitted during the decay .",
    "this normally requires that the lepton number is not conserved and the neutrino should contain a small fraction of massive particles equal to its anti - particles ( majorana neutrino ) .",
    "obviously , observation of @xmath13(0@xmath5)-decay will have significant implications for particle physics and fundamental symmetries , while observation of @xmath13(2@xmath5)-decay will provide information on nuclear structure physics that can be used in 0@xmath5-mode calculations .",
    "historically , the search for double - beta decay has been a very hot topic in nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "nuclear physicists and chemists employed a variety of direct ( nuclear radiation detection ) and geochemical methods . in recent years claims",
    "have been made for the observation of the @xmath14-decay mode in @xmath15ge @xcite .",
    "these rather controversial results were widely scrutinized and often rejected by the nuclear physics community @xcite . however , the 2@xmath5-decay mode has definitely been observed in many isotopes .",
    "table [ table0 ] provides a brief review of 2@xmath0-decay observations . because of the extremely low probability for double beta decay it was first detected by analyzing the chemical composition of rock samples and later verified by more accurate direct detection methods .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table2 ]    the present results can be compared with the yale university re - evaluation of the itep data @xcite .",
    "the major differences between the present work and itep include @xmath16te and @xmath17xe evaluated half - lives and the general evaluation philosophy .    *",
    "@xmath16te : the itep evaluation rejects one geochemical result @xcite as a possible indication of changing weak interaction constants over the last billion years and adopts the second one with corrections @xcite . the present evaluation is based on the final published results of five measurements without any corrections . *",
    "@xmath17xe : these data became available a year later than publication of the itep evaluation .",
    "the nndc half - life value is based on the results from three independent groups @xcite . *",
    "the itep evaluation treats all ( 2 + 0)@xmath5 observations as pure 2@xmath5-decay mode results and includes many other assumptions that allow deduction of the precise values of nuclear matrix elements based on very limited statistics .",
    "however , the present evaluation clearly indicates large uncertainties for nuclear matrix elements . *",
    "finally , this work uses the latest values of the phase factors @xcite , while itep is based on rather outdated values @xcite .",
    "the evaluated nuclear matrix elements can be compared with recent theoretical calculations of @xmath18 @xcite using the following equation @xcite @xmath19=1.273@xmath20 and @xmath21=0.511 mev .",
    "analysis of the data in table [ table2 ] indicates reasonably good agreement between theoretical and experimental values of the nuclear matrix elements .",
    "several deviations are due to problems with the calculation of nuclear matrix elements for very weak decays @xcite because accurate values of the gamow - teller strength functions are often missing .    to gain a better understanding of decay half - lives",
    ", we will analyze the half - life values of @xmath4te in more detail .",
    "both tellurium isotopes have the same charge and a similar shell structure and deformation , but the @xmath7-transition energies are different .",
    "it is natural to assume that the difference between tellurium half - lives is due to transition energies @xcite .",
    "in fact , in the present evaluation , central values for @xmath22 are consistent with the following ratio @xmath23 from this equation we deduce the following systematic trend @xmath24    this conclusion agrees well with the theoretical calculation of primakoff and rosen @xcite who predicted that for 2@xmath0(2@xmath5 ) decay , the phase space available to the four emitted leptons is roughly proportional to the 8@xmath25 through 11@xmath25 power of energy release .",
    "it is worth noting that in many direct detection experiments the discovery was based on the observation of the total energy deposition , and authors often could not separate a two - electron event from the single - electron tracks @xcite .",
    "consequently , the observed relation between experimental half - lives and transition energies provides an additional observable quantity for double - beta decay processes .",
    "additional analysis of @xmath26zr , @xmath27mo , @xmath28te , and @xmath17xe decay rates provides complimentary experimental evidence that deformation strongly affects the half - life values . for example , it is easy to see that the lower recommended value for @xmath27mo vs. @xmath26zr can not be explained by transition energy or electric charge contributions ; a similar situation exists for @xmath28te vs. @xmath17xe .",
    "these examples show that well - known experimental values of quadrupole deformation parameters could help to understand the relations between recommended half - lives when appropriate gamow - teller strength functions are not available from charge - exchange reactions @xcite or are extremely difficult to measure @xcite .",
    "double - beta decay is a very rare nuclear physics process that is often used to test theoretical model predictions for elementary particle and nuclear structure physics .",
    "the present work contains the latest evaluation of the experimental half - lives and nuclear matrix elements .",
    "the nuclear matrix elements strongly rely on phase factor calculations that can vary @xcite .",
    "this implies the importance of experimental _",
    "t_@xmath29 compilation and evaluation as a primary model - independent quantity .",
    "the compilation and analysis of experimental papers @xcite indicates a strong interest in double - beta decay over the past 75 years .",
    "several new measurements have been performed recently and many others are under way .",
    "this is why online compilation and 2@xmath0-decay data dissemination play essential roles .",
    "continuing research and observation of additional decay properties will help to clarify the situation by comparing the observables with theoretical predictions .",
    "the @xmath4te half - lives and their systematic trend could play a crucial role in our understanding of the interplay of phase factors and 2@xmath0(2@xmath5)-decay nuclear matrix elements , which will eventually lead to an overall improvement of theoretical models and better interpretation of experimental results .      _",
