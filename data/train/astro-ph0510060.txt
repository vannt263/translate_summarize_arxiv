    "pre - main - sequence stars surrounded by keplerian disks accrete substantial amounts of angular momentum along with infalling matter and energy .",
    "classical t - tauri stars ( cttss ) are widely understood to be low - mass ( @xmath2 ) pre - main - sequence stars with ages ranging from a few times @xmath3 to a few million years and represent the latest stages of protostellar accretion .",
    "the typical accretion torque on these stars is sufficient to spin them up to break - up speed in much less than @xmath4 yrs @xcite .",
    "the fact that many cttss ( the `` slow rotators '' ) spin at @xmath5% of break - up @xcite and have ages longer than their spin - up times , suggests that they are in spin equilibrium , wherein they somehow rid themselves of accreted angular momentum and thereby maintain a net zero torque .",
    "furthermore , in order to explain the distribution of rotational velocities of stars in young clusters , it is generally believed ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) that rotational braking of the star becomes inefficient when accretion ceases .",
    "the leading explanation for angular momentum loss during accretion , referred to as `` disk locking '' @xcite , requires a significant spin - down torque on the star arising from a magnetic connection between the star and disk .",
    "however , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) discussed several severe problems with the disk locking scenario , most notably that the stellar magnetic field topology should be largely open , rather than connected to the disk .",
    "the presence of open stellar field lines allows for , and may be caused by , a stellar wind , and the immediate question is whether a wind along these open lines carries away enough angular momentum to counteract the accretion torque @xcite .    in this letter ,",
    "we report ( in  [ sec_equilib ] ) that protostellar winds can remove accreted angular momentum , even for slow stellar rotation rates , provided that the stars have large mass loss rates .",
    "we propose that the energy driving the stellar wind derives from accretion power (  [ sec_power ] ) , and this also explains the apparent connection between efficient braking and accretion . in section [ sec_synthesis ] ,",
    "we combine the results of many studies of the star - disk interaction to give a complete picture for the flow of matter and angular momentum near the star .",
    "we consider long - term torques , averaged over @xmath6 yr ( i.e. , much less than spin - up / down times ) .",
    "the approximation of a steady - state and the adoption of global , axisymmetric magnetic fields are thus acceptable , even though the magnetic structure , winds , and accretion properties are variable and probably not axisymmetric , on much shorter timescales . the torque on the star , due to the accretion of disk matter , is ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) ) is valid for spin rates well below breakup speed . ]",
    "@xmath7 where @xmath8 is the mass accretion rate , @xmath9 is the gravitational constant , @xmath10 is the mass of the star , and @xmath11 is the location of the inner edge of the disk , from which material essentially free - falls onto the stellar surface @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we compare this accretion torque with the torque originating from a stellar wind .",
    "x - ray observations @xcite and magnetic field measurements @xcite of cttss reveal the presence of hot coronae and dynamically important fields . together with the rotation rates , these observations suggest that cttss drive stellar winds by coronal thermal pressure ( similar to the sun ) and that magneto - centrifugal effects may also play a role .",
    "furthermore , @xcite recently reported evidence for hot ( @xmath12k ) , fast ( @xmath13 km s@xmath14 ) stellar winds from two cttss .",
    "thus , we believe it is appropriate to adopt standard magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) wind theory ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for these systems . in this case",
    ", the torque on the star , due to angular momentum lost to the wind , is given by ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ) is valid for any magnetic geometry .",
    "@xcite used a different formulation for a dipolar magnetic field , but this was a misinterpretation of eq .",
    "( 12 ) in mestel ( 1984 ) , which requires stellar surface values of density and velocity , instead of the total mass outflow rate @xmath15 . ] .",
    "@xmath16 where @xmath15 is the mass loss rate in the stellar wind , @xmath17 is the angular spin rate of the star , @xmath18 is the stellar radius , and @xmath19 is the alfvn radius , defined as the location where the wind velocity reaches the local alfvn speed .",
    "the dimensionless factor of order unity @xmath20 takes into account the geometry of the wind ( @xmath21 , for a spherically symmetric wind ) .",
    "in essence , wind theory tells us that magnetized stars spin `` with their arms out , '' and the resulting spin - down torque depends most strongly on the length of their lever arm , @xmath19 .",
    "assuming that a spin - down torque arising from a disk connection and spin - up due to contraction are negligible , the equilibrium spin rate of the star is determined by the balance of accreted angular momentum with the spin - down torque from the stellar wind @xcite . by equating @xmath22 ( eqs .",
    "[ [ eqn_tacc ] ] and [ [ eqn_twind ] ] ) , the equilibrium stellar spin rate is @xmath23 where we have expressed the spin rate as a fraction of the break - up speed , @xmath24 .",
    "it is immediately evident that stellar winds alone are capable of keeping cttss spinning well below the break - up rate , provided that they drive powerful ( i.e. , large @xmath15 ) winds and have a long magnetic lever arm .",
    "this result depends most strongly on the length of the lever arm , which is an uncertain parameter .",
    "the usual analytic calculation of @xmath25 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is not very reliable , as it employs a one - dimensional formulation ( instead of the two - dimensional problem here ) , and it depends strongly on the assumed magnetic geometry and wind speeds .",
    "however , the analytical result is still useful because it tells us @xmath25 depends on the ratio @xmath26 ( where @xmath27 is the field strength at the stellar surface ) , for a given magnetic geometry and wind speeds . using the well - studied example of the solar wind",
    ", we can get an initial estimate of @xmath19 , as follows .",
    "first we assume that ctts wind speeds are within a factor of a few of solar wind values , which we expect from the similar escape speeds and is supported by observations .",
    "second , for a lack of information to the contrary , we assume that the magnetic geometry in ctts winds is also not too different from solar . now , using the observational limit on the large - scale ( dipole ) component of ctts magnetic fields of @xmath28 g @xcite , and assuming @xmath29 , the ratio @xmath26 is equal to the solar wind value when @xmath30 yr@xmath14 . remarkably , this is approximately 10% of typical observed accretion rates @xcite .",
    "thus , for this value of @xmath15 , the lever arm length should be close to the solar value of 1216 @xcite and larger if @xmath15 is smaller .",
    "furthermore , this value of @xmath19 is consistent with numerical simulation results ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , when scaled for ctts winds , even for rotation rates of 10% of breakup .",
    "therefore , we believe that @xmath31 is reasonable , and the fiducial value in equation ( [ eqn_feq ] ) is justified .",
    "the relationship @xmath32 is consistent with the stellar outflow rates reported by @xcite , as well as the large - scale mass outflow rates inferred in these and younger systems @xcite . as further support ,",
    "a coronal wind with @xmath33 yr@xmath14 is consistent with ctts x - ray luminosities @xcite . in the following section",
    ", we show that accretion power is capable of driving massive stellar winds such as these .",
    "if the stellar wind alone counteracts the accretion torque , equation ( [ eqn_feq ] ) indicates that @xmath15 should be a substantial fraction of @xmath8 , which requires powerful wind driving .",
    "the observations discussed in  [ sec_equilib ] indicate that cttss have enhanced rotational , thermal , and magnetic energies in their coronae , relative to the present day sun , suggesting that ctts winds will be substantially more energetic and massive than the solar wind .",
    "it is not yet clear , however , whether scaled - up solar - type activity alone can drive high enough mass loss to satisfy equation ( [ eqn_feq ] ) @xcite .",
    "instead , we propose that the stellar wind is powered by the energy deposited on the star via accretion .",
    "this scenario is supported by observations of hot , stellar outflows @xcite .",
    "the details of the complicated interaction between the star and disk are not important for tabulating the accretion power . instead",
    ", this can be characterized as an inelastic process , wherein rotating disk material attaches itself to the stellar magnetosphere at @xmath11 , and eventually falls onto and becomes part of the star . what matters is the difference in the energy before and after this interaction .",
    "in particular , disk matter that falls from @xmath11 to @xmath18 liberates gravitational potential energy and also transfers its orbital kinetic energy onto the star .",
    "some of this energy is added to the rotational kinetic energy of the star ( at a rate @xmath34 ) , and , in spin equilibrium , is balanced by the work done by the stellar rotation on the wind ( at a rate @xmath35 ) .",
    "the remaining accretion power is , which are important only for fast rotation .",

    "we suggest that there are a number of possible ways in which some of this energy will transfer to the open field region of the stellar corona .",
    "accretion shocks @xcite , and possibly magnetic reconnection events @xcite , give rise to x - rays and uv excesses , which radiate the stellar surface .",

    "this formulation of the problem is advantageous , as it is valid for wind temperatures ranging from hot , in which thermal pressure dominates the wind dynamics , to cold , in which magneto - centrifugal effects dominate ( i.e. , fast magnetic rotator winds ) .",
    "the energy equation ( [ eqn_eng ] ) can be combined with the torque equation ( [ eqn_feq ] ) to solve for @xmath50 and @xmath51 , simultaneously , for any given coupling efficiency @xmath1 and thermal energy parameter @xmath49 .",
    "assuming @xmath52 , the observed x - ray temperatures and the observations of @xcite suggest that the value of @xmath49 for ctts s is likely to be in the range 0.33 . adopting the fiducial values of equation ( [ eqn_feq ] ) ,",
    "this likely range of @xmath53 requires a power coupling efficiency in the range @xmath54 , to achieve the ratio of stellar mass loss rate to disk accretion rate of @xmath55 and an equilibrium spin @xmath56 .",
    "this value of @xmath1 appears reasonable and should help to discriminate between different possible energy transfer mechanisms .",
    "figure [ fig_cartoon ] illustrates our proposed scenario for the dynamics and angular momentum evolution of the combined star - disk system . this is a synthesis of many results from the literature on disk winds ( e.g. , *",
    "* ) , stellar winds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , funnel flow accretion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the general star - disk interaction . in the figure , the stellar dipole magnetic field connects only to a small portion of the disk inner edge , as in  state 1 \" of @xcite . from there , disk material is channeled by the magnetic `` funnel '' to the polar region of the star , depositing mass , energy , and angular momentum .",
    "the star is rotating sufficiently slowly that the corotation radius , @xmath57 , is outside the connected region , and the star feels only a spin - up torque from its interaction with the disk . at the same time , there is a powerful wind along the open stellar field .",
    "the stellar wind alfvn surface ( dashed line ) is near 15 @xmath18 at mid latitudes , and crosses the pole at a much larger spherical radius , giving an effective cylindrical lever arm length , @xmath19 , of approximately 15 @xmath18 .    with an estimate of @xmath19 ,",
    "it is possible to consider the influence of rotation on the wind , since magneto - centrifugal effects begin to be important when @xmath19 is greater than @xmath58 .",
    "@xcite showed ( see his fig .",
    "2 ) that , for @xmath59 equal to the solar wind value , centrifugal acceleration is of equal importance with thermal driving when @xmath60 . for a star rotating at 10% of breakup ,",
    "this means that equality of thermal and centrifugal effects occurs when @xmath61 .",
    "the logical conclusion is that centrifugal effects will be at least marginally important in ctts winds when @xmath62 yr@xmath14 , and may dominate for much lower values of @xmath15 ( since @xmath19 is then larger ) or faster rotation rates .",
    "even with marginal centrifugal effects , these winds should be self - collimated , and most wind parameters ( e.g. , @xmath19 ) depend on @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , at large distances from any magnetic rotator , wind material possesses angular momentum equivalent to an amount as if the wind were corotating at @xmath19 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , ctts winds should rotate at a speed comparable to that of a disk wind @xcite at observationally resolved distances from the star .    as shown in figure [ fig_cartoon ] , a disk wind is present that extracts angular momentum from the disk .",
    "the alfvn surface of the disk wind ( dash - dotted line ) gives an effective lever arm that is a few times the radius of the footpoint of the field lines from which the wind flows .",
    "the disk and stellar winds collimate on a scale larger than the figure .",
    "it is evident that the presence of the accretion disk is likely to affect the stellar wind .",
    "in particular , the disk wind can help to collimate the stellar wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , acting as a hydrodynamic `` channel . ''",
    "this would result in shallower magnetic and thermal pressure gradients and possibly increase @xmath19 , relative to the case of an isolated stellar wind . finally , the sheared interface between the two winds is likely to produce observable signatures from interesting phenomena , such as shocks and kelvin - helmholz instabilities , and there exists a current sheet that should give rise to magnetic reconnections and particle acceleration .",
    "in essence , the accretion powered stellar wind model solves the stellar angular momentum problem in the same way that a disk wind aids angular momentum transport in the disk ( * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "both the star and disk may drive accretion - powered magnetic outflows that are @xmath63% of @xmath64 .",
    "in the case of the disk , the local rotation rate is at break - up , so a short lever arm is sufficient to provide angular momentum transport there .",
    "the star , on the other hand , has a much stronger magnetic field than the disk , resulting in a longer lever arm , and so an equilibrium spin rate of much less than break - up speed is possible .",
    "the configuration of figure [ fig_cartoon ] , as well as the possibility that the most significant spin - down torques on the star originate from open stellar field lines , is well - supported by the numerical mhd simulations of @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* but see @xcite ) .",
    "this picture may also apply to accreting systems other than cttss , such as cataclysmic variables , binary x - ray pulsars , and accreting black holes .",
    "we propose that the slow spin of cttss is explained by a balance between the spin - up torque from accretion and the spin - down torque from a stellar wind ( eq .  [ [ eqn_feq ] ] ) . in this scenario ,",
    "some fraction ( @xmath1 ) of the energy released by accretion ultimately powers a stellar wind with a large mass loss rate ( @xmath65 ) and rapid angular momentum loss .",
    "furthermore , we expect that there is a threshold value of @xmath66 , below which the contraction of the star is more important than accretion torques . at this later time",
    ", stellar spin evolution could be controlled by the interplay between contraction to the main sequence and a conventional stellar wind .",
    "thus , an intrinsic spread in the timescale for the decline of accretion could explain the distribution of rotational velocities in young clusters @xcite , in the same manner as that usually attributed to disk locking .",
    "our analysis is free from the problems facing disk - locking models discussed by @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the x - wind ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and subsequent work ) and standard star - disk torque models @xcite require a large - scale magnetic field that is stronger than current observations allow .",
    "these models also assume an unrealistically strong magnetic connection between star and disk and neglect any torque contribution from a stellar wind . in this letter",
    ", we showed that a stellar wind is capable of providing significant torques , even when the magnetic field is an order of magnitude weaker than that required by disk - locking models .",
    "our estimate of @xmath19 (  [ sec_equilib ] ) suggests that cttss have sufficiently long lever arms , but this calculation should be made more precise .",
    "observations of the hot , possibly stellar , outflows can further constrain our model .",
    "more high - resolution spectroscopy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may reveal stellar wind signatures that will provide better constraints on @xmath15 , @xmath49 , and @xmath1 .",
    "finally , additional measurements or limits on the large - scale magnetic field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would be useful to constrain the value of @xmath19 ."
