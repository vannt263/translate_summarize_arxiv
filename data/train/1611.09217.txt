    "experimental searches for the qgp in heavy - ion collisions can not be completed successfully without reliable and justified signals of its formation . although some irregularities , known as the kink [ ] , the strangeness horn [ ] and the step [ ] , are widely considered as the signals of the onset of deconfinement [ ] , their relation to the qgp - hadron mixed phase is far from being clear .",
    "therefore , the development of realistic models which are able to accurately describe the existing experimental data and to provide us with the reliable information about the late stages of the heavy - ion collision process is absolutely necessary .",
    "the high quality description of data achieved recently for 111 independent hadron yield ratios measured at midrapidity in central nucleus - nucleus collisions for 14 values of the center of mass energies undoubtedly proves that the hrgm with the multicomponent hard - core repulsion is a precise and a sensitive tool of heavy ion collision phenomenology [ ] .",
    "in contrast to other existing versions of hrgm [ ; ] the present one accounts for the hard - core repulsion using different hard - core radii for pions , @xmath8 , kaons , @xmath9 , @xmath10-hyperons , @xmath11 , other mesons , @xmath12 , and other baryons , @xmath13 .",
    "with such a model we are able to fit the experimental multiplicities measured at ags for @xmath14 gev , the na49 data measured at sps energies @xmath15 gev and the star data measured at rhic energies @xmath16 gev with the highest quality @xmath0 [ ; ] .",
    "therefore , using the hrgm with the multicomponent hard - core repulsion we can study thermodynamics of strongly interacting matter at cfo with very high confidence .    using the multicomponent version of hrgm",
    "[ ; ] we previously found the set of strongly correlated quasi - plateaus in the collision energy dependence of the entropy per baryon and of the pion number ( both the thermal and total ) per baryon at cfo [ ] . such strongly correlated plateaus were predicted a long time ago as a signal of qgp - hadron mixed phase formation [ ; ; ] .",
    "hence , it was argued that the observed dramatic changes in the system properties seen in the narrow collision energy range @xmath17 gev evidence for the qgp formation in nuclear collisions [ ] .    with the help of this hrgm we also found the new irregularities related to deconfinement .",
    "the most spectacular of them is a sudden jump of the pressure @xmath18 at cfo in the narrow range of center of mass collision energies @xmath6 gev [ , ] .",
    "the observed pressure jump at cfo is so strong , that the effective number of degrees of freedom , @xmath19 , increases by 70% , while the collision energy in the center of mass system changes by 15% and while the cfo temperature @xmath20 changes by 30% .",
    "below we discuss other irregularities and possible signals of the mixed phase formation in nuclear collisions which are of great importance for the success of the planned heavy - ion collision experiments at jinr - nica and gsi - fair .",
    "let us consider the boltzmann gas of @xmath21 hadron species in a volume @xmath22 that has the temperature @xmath20 , the baryonic chemical potential @xmath23 , the strange chemical potential @xmath24 and the chemical potential of the isospin third component @xmath25 .",
    "such an approach is based on the assumption of local thermal and chemical equilibrium at cfo .",
    "hence the hadron yields produced in the collisions of large atomic nuclei can be found using the grand canonical valuables .",
    "the system pressure @xmath18 and the @xmath26-th charge density @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) of the i - th hadron sort are given by the expressions @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a symmetric matrix of the second virial coefficients , and @xmath31 is the hard - core radius of hadron of sort @xmath32 .",

    "the fitting parameters are the temperature @xmath20 , the baryonic chemical potential @xmath23 and the chemical potential of the third projection of isospin @xmath25 , whereas the strange chemical potential @xmath24 is found from the condition of vanishing strangeness .    in order to account for the possible strangeness non - equilibrium",
    "we employ the @xmath43 factor [ ] by replacing @xmath44 in eqs .",
    "( [ eqii ] ) as @xmath45 . here",
    "@xmath46 is a number of strange valence quarks plus number of strange valence anti - quarks .",
    "the width correction is taken into account by averaging the boltzmann exponent with the breit - wigner distribution . as a result",
    ", the modified thermal particle density of @xmath35-th hadron sort acquires the form @xmath47 here @xmath39 denotes the mean mass of hadron and @xmath48 stands for the threshold in the dominant decay channel .",
    "the main advantages of this approximation are a simplicity of its realization and a clear way to account for the finite width of hadrons .",
    "the effect of resonance decay @xmath49 on the final hadronic multiplicity is taken into account as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 = 1 for the sake of convenience .",
    "the masses , the widths and the strong decay branchings @xmath52 of all experimentally known hadrons were taken from the particle tables used by the thermodynamic code thermus [ ] .",
    "the detailed description of the analyzed data sets together with the fit procedure can be found in [ ] .",
    ".[tab : bolts ] the quality of data description achieved for the center of mass collision energy @xmath53 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the best global fit of all hadronic multiplicities corresponds to @xmath13 = 0.355 fm , @xmath12 = 0.4 fm , @xmath8 = 0.1 fm , @xmath9 = 0.38 fm and @xmath54 fm with the quality @xmath55 [ ] .",
    "these hard - core radii were chosen , since the most abundant particle which are measured for all collision energies are pions , kaons , protons and ( anti)@xmath10 hyperons . as a result , this set of hard - core radii allowed us for the first time to simultaneously describe the peaks in @xmath56 and @xmath57 ratios [ , ] without spoiling the high quality description of all other ratios .",
    "note that for more than a decade these particle yield ratios , known as the strangeness horn @xmath56 and the lambda hyperon horn @xmath57 , were the most problematic ones for the traditional thermal models [ ] . in figure  1",
    "we compare these experimental ratios and their fits achieved by the multicomponent hrgm .",
    "the obtained quality of fit of independent particle ratios for each center of mass collision energy point is presented in table 1 .",
    "( left panel , @xmath58 ) and @xmath59 ( right panel , @xmath60 ) hadron yield ratios . ]",
    "it is necessary to stress that with the help of the present formulation of hrgm a plateau in the collision energy dependence of the thermal pion number per baryon and the quasi - plateaus in the entropy per baryon and in the total pion number per baryon were found recently in [ ] . a simultaneous appearance of these quasi - plateaus was predicted a long time ago in [ ; ; ] to be a signal of the qgp - hadron mixed phase formation .",
    "their appearance is a manifestation of anomalous thermodynamic properties of the mixed phase .",
    "the validity of this signal is strongly supported by an existence of the sharp peak of the trace anomaly at @xmath7 gev ( see the right panel of figure  2 ) .",
    "note that the inflection point / maximum of the trace anomaly is traditionally used in lattice qcd to determine the pseudocritical temperature of the cross - over transition ] .",
    "furthermore , our simulations of the generalized shock adiabat show that this peak of @xmath61 at cfo is a consequence of the peak of trace anomaly on the shock adiabat located exactly at the boundary of the mixed phase and qgp . from the expression for trace anomaly        @xmath62",
    "one can show [ ] that the strong increase of @xmath61 when the collision energy changes from @xmath63 gev to @xmath7 gev is provided by a strong jump of the effective number of degrees of freedom @xmath64 on this interval . here @xmath65 is the energy density and @xmath66 is the entropy density .",
    "also at @xmath7 gev we observe a sharp peak of the baryonic density at cfo ( see the left panel of figure  2 ) , which is a consequence of the baryonic density peak at the generalized shock adiabat existing at the boundary between the mixed phase and qgp .",
    "ratio obtained within the present hrgm .",
    "the lines are given to guide the eye . ]",
    "dependence of @xmath67 ( left panel ) and the asymmetry between total and thermal multiplicities for kaons ( squares ) , @xmath10 ( circles ) and and @xmath68 ( triangles ) hyperons ( right panel ) obtained within the present hrgm .",
    "the lines are given to guide the eye . ]    the other evidence of a possible deconfinement transition between the collision energies @xmath69 and @xmath70 gev is provided by the sudden increase of @xmath1 slope at @xmath69 gev ( see figure  3 ) .",
    "the same behavior was found for @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 ratios .",
    "this behavior can be naturally explained [ ] by the idea suggested in [ ] that the mixed phase formation can be detected by a rapid increase in the number of strange quarks per number of light quarks .",
    "evidently , the @xmath71 ratio is a convenient indicator because at low collision energies the @xmath10-hyperons are generated in collisions of nucleons .",
    "moreover , such a ratio does not depend on baryonic chemical potential , since both the protons and @xmath10-hyperons have the same baryonic charge . as it is seen from the figure  3 ,",
    "this mechanism works up to @xmath72 gev , while an appearance of the mixed phase leads to an increase of the number of strange quarks and antiquarks due to the annihilation of light quark - antiquark and gluon pairs .    a similar behavior with a clear jump at the energies @xmath73 gev we predict for the collision energy dependence of the ratio @xmath74 which is shown in the left panel of figure  4 .",
    "since the observed jump of this ratio is located in the collision energy region of the mixed phase formation ( i.e. with a first order phase transition ) , then a change of its slope at @xmath75 gev can be naturally associated with a weak first order or a second order phase transition [ ] .",
    "note that this hypothesis is well supported by the second peak of the trace anomaly existing at @xmath75 gev ( see the right panel of figure  2 ) and by the second set of quasi - plateaus found for @xmath76 $ ] gev [ ] .    the observed irregularities are also accompanied by a sudden increase of the strange particle decays at cfo which is also seen in the same collision energy range @xmath77 $ ] gev .",
    "the asymmetries between the total and the thermal particle yields @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 are shown in the right panel of figure  4 .",
    "in addition to the irregularities discussed previously in [ ; ] here we present the new set of quantities which demonstrate a significant change in the same narrow range of the center of mass collision energy @xmath73 gev . using the multicomponent hrgm we achieved a nearly perfect description of the @xmath1 ratio for the collision energies",
    "@xmath53 = 2.7 - 7.6 gev .",
    "this result gives us a high confidence in the prediction that the ratios @xmath81 and @xmath82 can serve as the reliable indicators of deconfining phase transformation in heavy ion collisions . these irregularities are also accompanied by the jump of asymmetry between the total and the thermal particle yields @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , indicating a significant role of the strange particle decays at cfo .",
    "in addition , we found the strong sharp peaks in the trace anomaly @xmath83 and in the baryonic charge density at @xmath7 gev , which are related to the peaks of corresponding quantities on the generalized shock adiabat located at the boundary between the mixed phase and qgp .",
    "therefore , we conclude that a dramatic change of the system properties seen in the narrow collision energy range @xmath17 gev opens entirely new possibilities for the fair and nica experiments .",
    "we guess that the second set of peaks of these quantities which we observe at the collision energy @xmath84 gev may evidence for another phase transformation in heavy ion collisions , but to get more definite conclusions about them we need more experimental data measured with essentially higher precision .",
    "we hope that the future experiments at nica and fair will provide us with such data .",
