    "center vortices offer an appealing picture of confinement @xcite , for a recent review see @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the deconfinement phase transition can be understood as a depercolation transition @xcite and the free energy of a center vortex vanishes in the confinement regime @xcite .",
    "in fact there is mounting evidence that center vortices play an important rle in the qcd vacuum .",
    "lattice calculations show that when center vortices are removed from the yang - mills ensemble the string tension @xcite as well as the quark condensate and topological charge @xcite are lost .",
    "this indicates that confinement , spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry and the chiral anomaly are all triggered by center vortex configurations in the yang - mills vacuum .",
    "furthermore , lattice calculations @xcite show that restoration of chiral symmetry occurs at finite temperature exactly at the deconfinement phase transition .",
    "we can therefore expect that confinement and spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry are related phenomena . while the emergence of the confining potential , i.e.  the string tension , as well as the appearance of the deconfinement phase transition can be rather easily understood in a random center vortex model in an analytic fashion ,",
    "the mechanism of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry has not been explained in the vortex picture of the qcd vacuum , yet .",
    "the general folklore is that spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry is generated by the quasi - zero modes in topologically non - trivial field configurations , which give rise to a quasi continuous dirac spectrum with non - zero level density @xmath1 at zero virtuality and , by the banks casher relation , to a non - zero quark condensate @xmath2 .",
    "in fact these calculations @xcite show , that a non - zero level density at zero virtuality occurs in the confinement phase while a finite gap in the dirac spectrum is found above the critical temperature .",
    "it is therefore clear that the topological properties of center vortices and their manifestation in the quark spectrum will play the key rle in the understanding of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in the center vortex picture of the qcd vacuum . in @xmath3",
    "space - time dimensions center vortices represent closed surfaces of quantized electromagnetic flux which produce a non - trivial center element for a wilson loop when they are topologically non - trivially linked to the latter @xcite .",
    "the topological charge of center vortices is given by their ( oriented ) intersection number @xcite .",
    "according to the index theorem a non - zero topological charge implies zero modes of the dirac operator @xcite . in @xcite the quark zero modes in transversally intersecting vortex surfaces have been studied .",
    "it was found that these modes are localized at the vortex sheets , in particular at their intersection points . in @xmath4 dimensions a center vortex represents generically a time - dependent closed flux loop . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the topological charge of generic center vortices can be expressed by the temporal change of their writhing number , and furthermore transversal intersection points in @xmath3 correspond to crossing of vortex lines in @xmath4 .",
    "thus vortex crossings carry topological charge and by the index theorem should consequently manifest themselves in the quark spectrum .",
    "in this paper we study the quark spectrum in the background of time - dependent crossing center vortices .",
    "in particular we investigate how the crossing of vortices manifests itself in the quark spectrum .",
    "this might bring some light on the mechanism of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in the vortex picture , since it is believed that chiral symmetry breaking is tightly related to the topological properties of gauge fields .    throughout this paper",
    "the space - time - manifold is chosen to be the four - torus @xmath0 .",
    "there is a variety of reasons for studying @xmath0 : first , @xmath0 allows to use the atiyah - singer index theorem in a stringent fashion and allows for normalizable spinors in the background of integer flux .",
    "second , the torus simulates a periodic arrangement of vortices .",
    "this is much closer to a percolated vortex cluster than two isolated vortices in @xmath5 .",
    "finally , the torus is the space - time manifold that is also used in lattice calculations .",
    "the quark spectrum and its spectral flow in time - dependent background gauge fields have been addressed in several publications before , e.g.  @xcite . in these papers strict relations between the spectral flow of the dirac hamiltonian and topological properties of the corresponding background gauge field",
    "have been derived in minkowski space - time . in @xcite",
    "the spectral flow was considered on an infinite time interval , where the background gauge field has to become a pure gauge at @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in @xcite",
    "only spherically symmetric gauge fields have been examined , but the derived results are also valid on a finite time interval . in this paper",
    "we analyze the spectral flow in the presence of intersecting center vortices on a compact euclidean space - time manifold .",
    "the present paper is a continuation of ref .",
    "@xcite where the quark zero modes in intersecting center vortex sheets were considered . in the present paper",
    "we will not confine ourselves to the quark zero modes but study the spectral flow as function of the euclidean time for the time - dependent vortex crossings . from studying the spectral flow",
    "we hope to get some insight into the mechanism which produces the quasi - continuous spectrum of dirac states near zero virtuality . as a byproduct",
    "we will also establish a strict relation between the quark zero modes and the ( time - dependent ) eigenfunctions of the dirac hamiltonian in the case where the background fields consist of `` vortices '' with homogeneously spread out magnetic flux .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in the next section we consider the mathematical idealization of infinitely thick transversally intersecting vortices , i.e.  we consider `` vortices '' which are homogeneously distributed over the transversal dimensions , so that they represent homogeneous field configurations of constant electromagnetic flux .",
    "we consider two orthogonally homogeneously distributed fluxes , which can be considered as two infinitely thick intersecting vortices , where the intersection `` point '' is smeared out over the whole universe . accordingly",
    "the topological charge is homogeneously distributed over space - time .",
    "we will study then the eigenmodes of the dirac hamiltonian as function of the adiabatic time - evolution of the vortex flux assuming that the three - space is given by a three - torus . in section [ orthogonal - thin ]",
