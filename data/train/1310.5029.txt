    "the scalar - tensor ( st ) gravitational theory of mbelek and lachize - rey ( mlr ) @xcite , has the particularity of allowing electromagnetic ( em ) fields to modify the space - time metric far more strongly than predicted by general relativity and standard st theories .",
    "the theory was applied in cosmological @xcite and galactic @xcite contexts , and in @xcite it was used to explain the discordant measurements of newton gravitational constant as due to the effect of the earth s magnetic field . in @xcite it was further shown that a st theory of the mlr type can explain the unusual forces on asymmetric resonant cavities recently reported @xcite . besides , it was shown in @xcite that mrl theory also predicts rather strong effects on the amplitude of electromanetic waves propagation in static electric or magnetic fields .",
    "these unique effects area excelent candidates for table top experiments able to test this st theory of gravitation .",
    "we present in this work and additional effect predicted by mrl theory for quasi - stationary em fields , the generation of transient gravitational effects of relatively large magnitude by transient em fields . in particular , we explore with some detail the effect of turning or and off the current in a solenoid .",
    "although we do not perform an exhaustive analytical analysis of this case , the expected transient source of the gravitational potential is shown to be able to resonantly excite the oscillation of a pendulum up to measurable amplitudes .",
    "the details of the considered mlr st theory where already presented in @xcite and @xcite , so that only a brief account will be given here .",
    "the mrl action is given by ( si units are used ) @xmath0 d\\omega   \\notag \\\\ & & -\\frac{\\varepsilon _ { 0}c}{4}\\int \\sqrt{-g}\\lambda \\left ( \\phi \\right ) f_{\\mu \\nu } f^{\\mu \\nu } d\\omega -\\frac{1}{c}\\int \\sqrt{-g}j^{\\nu } a_{\\nu } d\\omega   \\notag \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{c}\\int \\mathcal{l}_{mat}d\\omega .",

    "these fields have vacuum expectation values ( vev ) @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "@xmath5 represents newton gravitational constant , @xmath6 is the velocity of light in vacuum , and @xmath7 is the vacuum permittivity .",
    "@xmath8 is the lagrangian density of matter .",
    "the other symbols are also conventional , @xmath9 is the ricci scalar , and @xmath10 the determinant of the metric tensor @xmath11 .",
    "the brans dicke parameter @xmath12 is considered a function of @xmath1 .",
    "the function @xmath13 in the term of the action of the em field is found in reduced , effective theories @xcite .",
    "the em tensor is @xmath14 ,  given in terms of the em quadri - vector @xmath15 , with sources given by the quadri - current @xmath16 . @xmath17 and @xmath18 are , respectively , the potential and source of the field @xmath2 .",
    "the source @xmath18 contains contributions from the matter , em field and the scalar @xmath1 . the model for @xmath18 proposed in @xcite is @xmath19where @xmath20 is the trace of the energy - momentum tensor of matter ,   @xmath21 the @xmath22 coefficients are unknown functions of the scalars , but in the weak - field ( wf ) approximation they only contribute through the values of their first - order derivatives at the vev @xmath23 and @xmath4 , and thus appear as adjustable constants .",

    "the non - homogeneous maxwell equations are obtained by varying ( [ skk ] ) with respect to @xmath34 , @xmath35with @xmath36 the vacuum permeability .    finally , the variation with respect to @xmath2 results in @xmath37",
    "as explained in @xcite and @xcite , the condition of recovering einstein - maxwell equations when the scalar fields are not excited requires that the @xmath22 coefficients in ( [ source ] ) and the potential @xmath38 be all zero when evaluated at the vev @xmath23 and @xmath4 , and also that @xmath39 .    with these considerations , eq .",
    "( [ skk ] ) can be approximated in the wf limit keeping only the lowest significant order in the perturbations @xmath40 of the metric @xmath11 about the minkowski metric @xmath41 , with signature ( 1,-1,-1,-1 ) , and of the scalar fields about their vev @xmath23 and @xmath42 , as    @xmath43    with the lorentz gauge @xmath44 where @xmath45 with @xmath46 . as can be seen in @xcite , for slow moving neutral masses ,",
    "the wf limit of the geodesic equation corresponds to motion in flat minkowski space - time under the action of a specific force ( per unit mass ) given by ( latin indices correspond to the spatial coordinates ) @xmath47    using eqs .",
    "( [ gik0 ] ) and ( [ forcepermass ] ) the gravitational field is thus represented in the wf approximation by a gravitational potential @xmath48 in flat minkowski space - time , whose determining equation with only scalar field sources is @xmath49    with respect to the equation for the scalar fields in the wf approximation , as was argued in @xcite , in order for the mlr theory to be consistent with the lack of strong gravitational effects due to the magnetic field of the earth , the non - linear terms in eqs .",
    "( [ phi ] ) and ( [ psi ] ) should be kept , even in the wf approximation .",
    "this is because the laplacian terms in these equations can be zero for this particular type of source , so that the equalities are satisfied by the higher order terms .",
    "specifically , for a static magnetic field outside its sources one can write @xmath50 , with @xmath51 , so that , from eqs .",
    "( [ phi ] ) and ( [ psi ] ) for the static case , one has    [ phipsinl ] @xmath52where @xmath53 , and    @xmath54    these equations have the solutions @xmath55 , so that @xmath56 , thus nullifying the contribution of the vacuum magnetic field as a source of the gravitational potential in the static version of eq . ( [ dalemchi ] ) .",
    "we note that the laplacian operator in eqs .",
    "( [ phipsinl ] ) is to be interpreted as @xmath57 for the static case , and so eqs .",
    "( [ phipsinl ] ) are correct up to order two in the perturbed fields .",
    "this kind of solution for the case of the earth s magnetic field is compatible with the proposal in @xcite , where the solution with @xmath58 was used , on the condition that @xmath59    in this way , one has @xmath60 where the constant @xmath61 depends , other than on @xmath62 , also on @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , and is directly determined from the system ( [ phipsinl ] ) with the condition @xmath66 . from the data in @xcite ,",
    "together with the _ assumption _ @xmath67 , and condition ( [ condmlr ] ) , one has @xmath68    for the case of quasi - stationary fields , for which @xmath69 with equal condition for the scalar @xmath70 , eqs .",
    "( [ phipsinl ] ) are correct up to order one in a small parameter representing the ratio of time derivatives to spatial derivatives ( @xmath71 is a characteristic length of the system , and @xmath72 a characteristic time of variation ) @xmath73 this is so because , as with the time derivatives in their left - hand sides , also the corrections in the right - hand sides of eqs .",
    "( [ phipsinl ] ) are of order @xmath74 .",
    "if one were simply to use this solution with @xmath75 in ( [ dalemchi ] ) the resulting equation would be @xmath76 however , the retained term is of order @xmath74 compared with the neglected one , so that in principle , by including the missing order @xmath74 terms in eqs .",
    "( [ phipsinl ] ) , a non - zero correction of that order could be found for @xmath77 .",
    "even for the simplest em sources this task is extremely difficult to perform analytically . besides",
    ", the existing uncertainties in the parameters of the theory do not allow a precise comparison of theory and experiment , but only order of magnitude estimations . in this way , at this point we will consider only the effect of the retained term in ( [ chi_final ] ) as an indicator of the order of magnitude reasonably expected of the transient effect .",
    "if a uniform magnetic field of slowly changing magnitude @xmath78 exists inside a sphere of radius @xmath71 , the magnetic field is given as ( in spherical coordinates ) @xmath79 so that@xmath80and , from ( [ chi_final ] ) , one has at leading order@xmath81where the primes indicate the time derivative .",
    "the solution of this equation that is continuous up to first order derivatives in @xmath82 is@xmath83    in this way , the rapidly dominating term for @xmath84 corresponds to a specific force ( per unit mass)@xmath85        the solution ( [ force ] ) is valid also for a solenoid of linear dimension @xmath86 for @xmath87 , so that we can very easily estimate the specific force for the case of a solenoid whose current is switched either on or off . for a linear ,",
    "cylindrical solenoid of length @xmath88 and radius @xmath71 , with @xmath89 turns and magnetic permeability @xmath90 one has @xmath91with self - inductance@xmath92and where the electric current @xmath93 satisfies@xmath94when it is switched on , and @xmath95when it is switched off , with @xmath96 the voltage of the power supply , @xmath9 the circuit resistance and @xmath97 . during the whole transient of the turning on or off of the magnetic field , the force ( [ force ] ) generates an `` impulsive '' velocity on a moving mass of value@xmath98using the previous expressions it results that@xmath99where the @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) sign corresponds to the switching on ( off ) of the current in the solenoid .    if the moving mass is the bob of a pendulum , by switching on and off the current to match the natural period of oscilation of the pendulum one could obtain a resonant forcing with noticeable effects .",
    "a sketch of the disposition of pendulum and coil for this kind of experiment can be seen in fig . 1 .",
    "a simple simulation was performed of the motion of a pendulum with a linear friction model , and a periodic impulsive forcing ( alternating in sign ) with amplitude @xmath102 and period @xmath103 . for low enough friction ( about @xmath104 free oscillations for a @xmath105 decay of the amplitude ) and @xmath103 matching the natural frequency of the pendulum with relative error less than @xmath106 , using a coil of @xmath107 turns ,",
    "@xmath108 , and length of the pendulum about @xmath109 , sources values of a few @xmath110 resulted in permanent amplitude oscillations of the order of @xmath111 , which should be easily appreciated .",
    "we have derived the equations for the expected gravitational effects of a transient quasi - stationary magnetic field , as predicted by mrl theory , and simulated the expected results in a simple enough experiment , which could easily discriminate the transient effects predicted ."
