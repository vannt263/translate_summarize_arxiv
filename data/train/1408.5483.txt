    "current improvements in cosmological measurements strongly favor the standard model of the universe being spatially flat , homogeneous and isotropic on large scales and dominated by dark energy consistently with the effect of a cosmological constant and cold dark matter .",
    "such a concordance model is referred to as @xmath0-cold dark matter ( @xmath0cdm ) model in the literature and depends on six cosmological parameters : the density of dark matter , the density of baryons , the expansion rate of the universe , the amplitude of the primordial fluctuations , their scale dependence , and the optical depth of the universe .",
    "these parameters are enough to successfully describe all current cosmological data sets , including the measurements of temperature and polarization anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) ( see , e.g. , ref . @xcite and references therein ) . therefore , according to the @xmath0cdm model the universe is well described by a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric , whose gravity source is a mixture of non - interacting perfect fluids including a cosmological constant .",
    "observations of distant type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) first pointed to the so - called _ dark energy _ as a major actor in driving the accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite . combined observations of large scale structure and",
    "the cosmic microwave background radiation then provided indirect evidence of a dark energy component with negative pressure , which gives the dominant contribution to the whole mass - energy content of the universe ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . at present , all existing observational data are in agreement with the simplest picture of dark energy as a cosmological constant effect , i.e. the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "nevertheless , no theoretical model determining the nature of dark energy is available as yet , leaving its existence still unexplained .",
    "other possibilities of a ( slightly ) variable dark energy have also been considered in recent years .",
    "these models include , for instance , a decaying scalar field ( quintessence ) minimally coupled to gravity , similar to the one assumed by inflation @xcite , scalar field models with nonstandard kinetic terms ( @xmath1essence ) @xcite , the chaplygin gas @xcite , braneworld models and cosmological models from scalar - tensor theories of gravity ( see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the possibility that the acceleration of the universe could be driven by the bulk viscosity of scalar theories has also been explored @xcite .",
    "relaxation processes associated with viscous fluid have been shown to reduce the effective pressure , which could become negative for a sufficiently large bulk viscosity , so mimicking a dark energy behavior @xcite .",
    "the present paper falls in the line of cosmological models with modified equation of state @xcite .",
    "the main idea is to postulate that the cosmological fluid obeys a non - ideal equation of state with `` asymptotic freedom , '' namely ideal gas behavior ( pressure and density changes in linear proportion to each other ) at both low and high density regimes , with a liquid - gas coexistence loop in between .",
    "such non - ideal equation state supports a phase transition , which models the growth of the dark matter - energy component of the universe , as a natural consequence of the fluid evolution equations .",
    "the idea of an asymptotic - free , non - ideal equation of state was first proposed by shan and chen ( sc ) in the context of lattice kinetic theory , with the primary intent of producing a liquid - vapor coexistence curve with _ purely attractive _",
    "interactions @xcite ( see appendix a ) . its distinctive feature is to replace hard - core repulsive interactions , as needed to tame unstable density build - up , with a purely attractive force , with the peculiar property of becoming vanishingly small above a given density threshold , i.e. a form of effective `` asymptotic freedom '' @xcite .",
    "the sc motivation was purely numerical , namely do away with the very small time - steps imposed by the hard - core repulsion in the numerical integration of the lattice kinetic equations .",
    "indeed , in the last two decades , the sc method has met with major success for the numerical simulation of a broad variety of complex flows with phase - transitions @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we maintain that the peculiar properties of the sc equation of state may offer fresh new insights into cosmological fluid dynamics , and most notably for the development of a new class of cosmological models with scalar gravity .",
    "in particular , given that the sc approach has proven very successful in dispensing with hard - core repulsion in ordinary fluids , it might be envisaged that , in the cosmological context , it would permit to do away with the repulsive action of the cosmological constant .",
    "as we shall see , this is just the case : a cosmological frw fluid obeying the sc equation of state naturally evolves towards a present - day universe with a suitable dark - energy component , with no need of invoking any cosmological constant .",

    "equivalently , here we have denoted @xmath16 , and expressed the saturation scale in terms of the free parameter @xmath17 .",
    "the quantity @xmath14 can be interpreted as the density of a chameleon scalar field @xcite , reducing to ordinary matter , i.e. , @xmath18 , in the low density limit @xmath19 and asymptotically goes to a uniform constant in the opposite limit .",
    "this scalar field carries a purely attractive interaction and consequently it contributes a negative pressure to the equation of state .",
    "since the associated force vanishes in the limit @xmath20 , this regime corresponds to an effective form of `` asymptotic freedom , '' occurring at cosmological rather than subnuclear scales .",
    "similarly to the case of lattice kinetic theory , in which the stabilizing effect of hard - core repulsion is replaced by an asymptotic - free attraction , the repulsive effect of the cosmological constant is here replaced by a scalar field with asymptotic - free attraction . at present",

    "we have presented a new class of cosmological models consisting of a frw universe with a fluid source obeying a non - ideal , shan - chen - like equation of state .",
    "the aim of this study was to explain the today dark energy abundance within a different approach with respect to the standard one , which postulates the existence of a mixture of non - interacting perfect fluids as source of a frw cosmology , including a cosmological constant as responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "we have shown that , in the case of a simple model without any additional component in the cosmological fluid , starting from an ordinary equation of state at early times ( e.g. , satisfying the energy condition typical of a radiation - dominated universe ) , the sc pressure changes its sign at a certain time in the past and remains negative for a large time interval , including the present epoch .",
    "this implies that the equation of state governing the evolution of the present - day universe is typical of dark energy . as a result ,",
    "such a dark energy component develops , with no need of invoking any cosmological constant . in order to account for the presence of matter density today we have then added to the sc fluid the contribution due to pressureless matter .",
    "the latter is shown to significantly affect the evolution of the sc density , which exhibits a twofold behavior depending on the parameter choice : it either evolves between two equilibrium states or indefinitely grows as the initial singularity is approached and vanishes at late times .",
    "furthermore , the additional matter component acts so as to contrast the onset of sc instabilities .",
    "in fact , a first order perturbation analysis reveals that a plain sc model is in general unstable against perturbations , whereas the inclusion of a pressureless matter component has a stabilization effect on the sc fluid , at least for those solutions evolving between two equilibrium states .",
    "we have also provided some observational tests in support to our model .",
    "more precisely , we have drawn the hubble diagram ( distance modulus vs redshift ) as well as the expansion history of the universe ( hubble parameter vs redshift ) , showing that they are consistent with current astronomical data .",
    "the model opens up several directions for future investigations , for instance a systematic exploration of the remaining parameters of the model , the analysis of different forms @xmath153 of the shan - chen excess pressure field and the inclusion of further additional components in the cosmological fluid , as well as a more accurate stability analysis exploring different initial conditions for the perturbation equations .",
    "it is well known that non - ideal fluid equations of state , say of van der waals type , result from underlying atomic potentials exhibiting short - range ( hard - core ) repulsion and long - range ( soft - core ) attraction .",
    "the prototypical example are lennard - jones fluids , whose spherically symmetric potential takes the so - called @xmath154 form v(r ) = 4 u , where @xmath155 is the typical equilibrium intermolecular distance , @xmath156 the typical strength of the interaction and @xmath157 is a natural dimensionless radial variable .",
    "the short - range @xmath158 branch leads to very strong repulsive forces on molecules penetrating the hard - core region @xmath159 ( actually @xmath160 ) , and consequently to impractically short time - steps in the numerical integration of the equations of motion of molecular fluids . to circumvent this problem , and with specific reference to _ lattice _",
    "fluids for which the time - step is fixed by the lattice size hence can not be reduced on demand shan and chen @xcite proposed a synthetic \" repulsion - free potential .",
    "more precisely , repulsion is replaced by a density - dependent attraction , and the density dependence is tuned in such a way that attraction becomes vanishingly small beyond a given density threshold , so as to prevent the onset of instabilities due to uncontrolled density pile - up . since high - density implies short spatial separation , the shan - chen potential implements a form of effective `` asymptotic freedom , '' meaning by this that molecules below a certain separation behave basically like free particles .",
    "mathematically , the shan - chen interaction leads to the following pair pseudo - potential [ scpot ] v(x , x)=(x)g(x - x)(x ) , =x+e_a , where @xmath161 denotes a generic spatial direction in the lattice ( the explicit dependence on time of the various functions has been omitted here to simplify notation ) .",
    "for instance , a typical two - dimensional lattice features one rest particle ( @xmath162 ) , @xmath163 nearest - neighbors ( @xmath164 ) , and @xmath163 next - nearest - neighbors ( @xmath165 , @xmath166 being the lattice light speed . \"    in the above , @xmath167 $ ] is a local functional of the fluid density and @xmath168 is the green function of the interaction . for the sake of simplicity , shan and chen took @xmath169 for @xmath170 and zero elsewhere , so that @xmath171 codes for attractive interaction .",
    "the associated force per unit volume of the fluid is then @xmath172 which equals @xmath173 in the limit @xmath174 .",
    "taylor expansion of the above expression gives @xmath175 where we have taken into account that @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "higher order terms describe physical properties such as surface tension , which play a crucial role in the dynamics of complex fluids , and are not discussed here . confining our attention to the contribution of the above force to the equation of state , it is easy to show that such contribution writes as an excess pressure of the form ( in lattice units @xmath178 : @xmath179 note that for attractive interactions",
    ", i.e. , @xmath171 , this excess pressure is negative .",
    "the functional form @xmath180 was chosen in ref .",
    "@xcite in such a way as to realize a vapor - liquid coexistence curve : @xmath181 where @xmath182 is a reference density , above which asymptotic freedom \" sets in .",
    "the definitions of @xmath14 and @xmath183 adopted here slightly differ from those used in section ii in order to follow the notation of the original work @xcite .",
    "it is readily checked that , via the equations @xmath184 and @xmath185 , the excess pressure ( [ pstar ] ) gives rise to the following set of critical values @xmath186 , @xmath187 and @xmath188 at which phase separation starts - off , having set @xmath189 , for simplicity . in the low density region , @xmath190 , @xmath191 and",
    "the shan - chen equation of state reduces to @xmath192 , @xmath193 being the sound speed of the ideal fluid .",
    "this is is clearly unstable for @xmath171 , as it yields @xmath194 for @xmath195 .",
    "this instability is tamed by letting the shan - chen force go to zero for @xmath196 . in the high density limit ,",
    "the shan - chen equation of state reduces to @xmath197 . consistently with the formal analogy with `` asymptotic freedom , '' this equation of state bears a close formal resemblance to the bag model of quark matter @xcite .",
    "these considerations suggest that the shan - chen model might have a bearing beyond the purpose of a mere technical trick .    in the cosmological context , @xmath198 is best interpreted as a scalar field , interacting via gauge quanta , whose propagator is given by @xmath168 in eqs .",
    "( [ scpot])([scforce ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that non - ideal , exotic \" fluids have been proposed before as models of dark energy , one popular example in point being the ( generalized ) chaplygin gas , with equation of state @xmath199 , @xmath200 being a positive constant and @xmath201 @xcite .",
    "a remarkable property of the chaplygin model is the fact of supporting negative pressure , jointly with positive sound speed ( squared ) .",
    "the chaplygin gas was derived as an approximation to a fluid dynamic equation of state , most notably as a mathematical approximation to compute the lifting force on a wing of an airplane @xcite . lately",
    ", it has been capturing increasing interest within the high - energy and cosmological communities in view of its large group of symmetry and the fact that it can be derived from the nambu - goto @xmath202-brane action in @xmath203 spacetime @xcite .",
    "however , to the best of the authors knowledge , no microscopic basis for the chaplygin gas model has been provided as yet .",
    "interestingly , the shan - chen equation of state also supports negative pressure regimes , jointly with positive @xmath204 , for values of @xmath205 sufficiently above @xmath206 .",
    "even though any connection of the shan - chen model to string theory remains totally unexplored at the time of this writing , we note that its equation of state is grounded into a sound microscopic basis , namely , according to the expression ( [ scforce ] ) , a scalar field interacting through ( short - ranged ) gauge quanta .",
    "based on the above , it appears reasonable to speculate that the shan - chen fluid , by now a very popular model for investigating a broad variety of complex flows with phase transitions , might have an interesting role to play in cosmological fluid dynamics as well ."
