    "the main interest usually focuses on the behaviour of green s and other quantum field correlation functions at short distances which provides information about high energy particle scattering processes .",
    "these observables are very insensitive to space topology or field boundary conditions @xcite .",

    "another rich source of information about the theory is encoded in the behaviour of non - local observables like free energy or entropy that can be defined by exploiting analogies with thermodynamics .",
    "the interest on observables of this type has been recently boosted by the development of quantum information theory .",
    "the entanglement entropy @xcite provides a good measure of the vacuum entanglement structure .",
    "it can also be used to point out the existence of phase transitions since it is unbounded for critical systems and bounded for systems with a finite mass gap @xcite .",
    "it has been also pointed out that the confinement mechanism might be related to vacuum entanglement @xcite .",

    "the entanglement entropy scales in the critical case with the area of the boundary where the fluctuating modes of the vacuum are traced out @xcite@xcite .",
    "this behaviour is characteristic of black hole physics and is one of the key features of the ads / cft correspondence .    by their own nature",
    "it is quite possible that both new entropies shall depend on the global properties of the configuration space . in this note",

[ dirichlet2 ]    the boundary entropy can easily be computed for all those cases and the results are :    @xmath66    the singularity observed for quasiperiodic boundary conditions at @xmath67 is due to the existence of zero - modes which once properly incorporated into the compact theory give rise to the correct value for periodic boundary conditions ( [ peri2 ] ) ( [ peri22 ] ) with vanishing boundary entropy .",

    "this asymptotic behaviour follows an area law similar to the black hole area law @xcite . in general , for @xmath80 the coefficients @xmath81 are not universal because they are regularization dependent .",
    "however , for one - dimensional spaces , although the formula ( [ al ] ) suggests that @xmath82 could be universal , it does not happen .",
    "in fact , the asymptotic behaviour of the entanglement entropy is not given in that case by ( [ al ] ) because that entropy acquires a leading logarithmic correction s__1=c + c_0 , [ eone ] which obviously implies that the constant term is highly dependent on the regularization method .",

    "the question is whether this value is dependent or not on the boundary conditions of the fields when the theory is defined on a large bounded domain @xmath88 it is remarkable that coefficient @xmath89 turns out to be independent of the choice of boundary condition in @xmath90 when @xmath91 is chosen to have half of the size of the interval .",
    "this result can be easily understood as a consequence of the fact that the entanglement entropy is basically due to the behaviour of field correlations at the interface between @xmath74 and its complement @xmath92 which does not involve the boundary values of the fields . on the other hand",
    "the finite part @xmath82 is highly dependent on the ultraviolet regularization method .    however , when @xmath74 reaches the boundary of the whole space @xmath0 the entropy has the same asymptotic behaviour @xcite s_l= + g+ 12 c_0 , [ eon ] but with a different coefficient for the asymptotic logarithmic term and a different finite term which is related to the boundary entropy @xcite and , thus also dependent on the boundary condition .",
    "the behaviour of this quantity along the boundary renormalization group flow has then the same monotone behaviour that the boundary entropy .",
    "a similar phenomenon occurs in 2 + 1 dimensions with the constant term . in general , the entropy is given by s__1= c_1 + c + c_0 .",

    "the smoothness condition requires that the curvature of the boundaries must be always much larger than the ultraviolet cut - off @xmath78 @xcite . in that case",
    ", the remaining constant @xmath82 has a special behaviour because not only is regularisation independent but also independent on the size of @xmath74 .",
    "@xmath82 can be split in two terms @xmath96 , one @xmath97 which contains all possible dependences on the prescription used for the definition of the @xmath74 perimeter @xmath77 , and another one @xmath98 which is absolutely prescription independent . in a massive theory ,",
    "if @xmath77 is much larger than the inverse of the mass gap @xmath99 , there is a prescription which uniquely fixes the ambiguities involved in such a splitting @xcite @xcite .",
