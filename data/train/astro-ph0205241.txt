    "supernova  2002ap was discovered by yoji hirose on 2002 january 29.4 ut in the spiral galaxy m74 @xcite .",
    "it was discovered at @xmath8 , and at a distance of approximately 7.3mpc , may be the closest supernova since sn  1993j in m81 ( at 3.6mpc ) .",
    "several observers rapidly obtained spectra , and reported that it appeared similar to the peculiar sn  1998bw and caught at an earlier epoch ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "later optical spectra of sn  2002ap indicate that it does appear to be a type ic , and its optical lightcurve appears to have peaked at approximately @xmath9 , some 1.7@xmath10 fainter than sn  1998bw .",
    "unlike sn  1998bw , there has been no detection of a @xmath11-ray burst ( grb ) which could in any way be coincident with the position of sn  2002ap @xcite .",
    "however @xcite suggest that their more accurate determination of the date of peak luminosity means the time - frame for which gamma - ray data should be searched needs to be extended , and this has not yet been done systematically . in a preliminary spectral analysis @xcite",
    "suggest that it had a kinetic energy @xmath12ergs , a factor of roughly 10 less than that of sn  1998bw , but similar to the hypernova sn1997ef @xcite .",
    "the spectral similarity to sn  1998bw , the possible link between very energetic supernovae and grbs , and the lack of substantive data on rare typeic events make this bright supernova a very important object to monitor and study in detail .    a distance of 7.3mpc ( @xmath13 ) to the galaxy m74",
    "(= ngc  628 ) has been determined by @xcite and @xcite from the magnitudes of the brightest blue and red supergiants .",
    "although this method suffers from significant uncertainties ( typically @xmath14 in @xmath15 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , m74 is certainly close enough to allow extensive observations of this bright supernova for some time .",
    "supernova types  ii , ib and ic are thought to originate in the collapse of the iron cores of massive stars at the end of their nuclear burning lifetimes .",
    "but the types of stars that cause these , are not well constrained by observations .",
    "the only definite detection and determination of the spectral type of a supernova progenitor is that of sk@xmath16 , the precursor to sn  1987a ( a b3ia supergiant ; * ? ? ?",
    "the progenitor of sn  1993j in m81 was identified as a possible k0ia with some excess @xmath17 band flux from either an unresolved ob association or a hot companion @xcite . in two recent papers",
    "smartt et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2002 ) presented high - resolution prediscovery images of two nearby typeii - p supernovae , sne  1999gi and 1999em . in neither case was an actual progenitor star detected despite the depth of the exposures , however upper mass limits of the progenitor stars were derived of 9@xmath18m@xmath5 , and 12@xmath19m@xmath5 respectively .",
    "typeic supernovae probably arise in stars which have lost their h and he envelopes , and possible candidates are massive wr stars , or stripped high- or intermediate - mass stars in interacting binaries . in this _",
    "we present analysis of optical and near - ir images of m74 taken before the explosion of sn  2002ap , and ascertain if there is any sign of a massive luminous progenitor star .",
    "we have 2 sets of wide - field optical images of m74 taken before discovery of 2002ap from different sources .",
    "the first set are from the wide - field - camera ( wfc ) on the isaac newton telescope ( int ) , la palma , taken on 2001 july 24 through filters @xmath20 .",
    "the exposures were 120s in each of @xmath21 and 180s in @xmath22 .",
    "these were taken at the end of a night during the wide field survey programme on faint sky variability @xcite .",
    "the wfc comprises 4 thinned eev 4k@xmath232k ccds , with 13.5@xmath24 m ( @xmath25 ) pixels .",
    "repeat exposures of 120s in @xmath26 were taken on 2002 february 2 .",
    "the supernova core saturated in these frames , and shorter 2 - 10s exposures were taken with the telescope guiding continuously between the short and long exposures to determine an accurate position for sn  2002ap .",
    "the second set of images is from the kpno 0.9 m with the direct imaging camera taken on 1993 september 15 & 17 .",
    "multiple individual frames of exposure length between 400 - 600s were stacked together to give total exposure times of 5400s ( in @xmath27 ) , 3600s ( @xmath28 ) , 3200s ( @xmath29 ) , and 6900s ( h@xmath30 ; presented previously in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this camera has a @xmath31 tek ccd with @xmath32pixels and the seeing in both cases was @xmath33 .",
    "a @xmath34band image of m74 was taken by r.s . de jong using the bok 2.3 m .",
    "telescope of the steward observatory on 1999 october 18 with the pisces camera @xcite ; a hawaii hgcdte array of 1024@xmath231024 pixels of @xmath35 on the sky .",
    "these observations were mosaiced to cover the full optical disk of m74 and total on - source exposure time at the position of sn2002ap was 675s .",
    "the centroid of sn  2002ap , measured in the 2002 february wfc images , was located on all prediscovery images . between 7 and 14 bright stars in each of the images",
    "were used to define a transformation with standard techniques within @xmath36 , using aperture photometry to determine the centroids of the stars .",
    "the supernova position is marked in fig.1 .",
    "the errors in the sn position were calculated by taking the quadratic sum of the transformation error and the positional error of the supernova centroid , and are in the range @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "there is a nearby bright object clearly detected in @xmath39 but , at a distance of @xmath40 from the supernova centroid , it is definitely not coincident with the explosion . we have estimated limiting sensitivities for each image based on poisson statistics and the 3@xmath41 limiting magnitudes are listed in table1 for each filter .",
    "the photometric zero - points for the @xmath42 images were calibrated from the photometric sequence in the field of m74 published by @xcite .",
    "the calibration of the @xmath34band is described in @xcite .    in order to convert these observational limits to more useful limits on the ( de - reddened ) absolute magnitudes , the extinction towards the progenitor and distance to the host galaxy",
    "are required .",
    "@xcite have measured the interstellar medium nai d1 absorption feature due to the gas in m74 , and have determined a value of @xmath43 for the host galaxy .",
    "assuming a ratio of total - to - selective extinction of 3.1 , @xmath44 magnitudes .",
    "the galactic extinction estimates are listed in table1 , ( from schlegel et al .",
    "1998 , assuming r=3.1 , and conversion factors from cardelli , clayton & mathis 1989 ) , and these clearly dominate total extinction ( galactic + host ) .",
    "there is no cepheid distance determination to m74 , and @xcite point out a discrepancy between two distance modulus measurements of nearly 5 magnitudes .",
    "the distance of 7.3mpc derived by both @xcite and @xcite is intermediate between these other two , and we assume this distance in the rest of the paper .",
    "we used the distance to m74 itself rather than the mean distance to the m74 group derived by @xcite which was used by @xcite .",
    "the difference is 0.2@xmath10 , and does not have significant consquences for the conclusions presented below .    the detection limits in each filter can be converted to upper limits on the bolometric luminosity of the progenitor star ( as in smartt et al .",
    "2001 , 2002 ) .",
    "the simple equation is    @xmath45    by applying the bolometric correction ( bc ) we obtain the upper limit for the bolometric luminosity .",
    "however , the spectral type of the progenitor is unknown . to determine @xmath46 for supergiants in the temperature range o5 to m5 ,",
    "the bc for each spectral type is taken from @xcite .",
    "the other @xmath47 filters can be used in a similar way ( as discussed in smartt et al .",
    "2002 ) to provide further constraints on @xmath46 .",
    "the limiting values of @xmath46 as a function of stellar effective temperature are plotted in fig.2 .",
    "sn  2002ap lies at @xmath48 from the centre of m74 .",
    "assuming a distance of 7.3mpc , this corresponds to 9.8kpc , which is outside the main area of current star formation activity .",
    "several authors have studied the radial abundance gradients across this galaxy from hii region analysis @xcite . from these four studies ,",
    "the mean oxygen abundance at a distance of 9.8kpc is @xmath49dex , which is a factor of 2 below that of solar neighbourhood hii regions and young stars . to compare the evolutionary states of massive evolved stars with the luminosity limits derived",
    ", we use the stellar evolutionary tracks of @xcite which have a metallicity @xmath50 .",
    "however , given the scatter in the abundance measurements , an initial progenitor metallicity close to solar can not be ruled out .    in fig.2",
    "we plot on an hr diagram the upper limits on the bolometric luminosities , together with the stellar evolutionary tracks for a range of ms masses .",
    "hence there are types of massive stars at particular evolutionary states that we can firmly rule out as being the progenitor of this typeic supernova .",
    "these are as follows    1 .   massive stars with initial masses greater than @xmath630m@xmath5which have evolved off the main - sequence but",
    "not yet reached the wolf - rayet stage ; such as luminous blue variables ( lbv ) , and yellow hypergiants .",
    "these stars still have hydrogen rich envelopes , and so our constraint is in agreement with the lack of hydrogen seen in sn  2002ap and typeic sne in general .",
    "we certainly would have detected lbvs similar to galactic examples such as @xmath51carinae , pcygni , agcarinae @xcite .",
    "2 .   massive blue supergiants .",
    "the @xmath3band image should have detected a star like sk@xmath16 ( progenitor of sn  1987a ) at the 3@xmath41 level .",
    "we would certainly have detected more massive counterparts while they were b - type supergiants .",
    "we would have detected all b and a - type supergiants with initial masses greater than @xmath625m@xmath5 .",
    "red and yellow supergiants with masses greater than approximately 15m@xmath5 .",
    "such progenitors would have been detected in the @xmath52 passbands .",
    "this is consistent with the suggestion of @xcite that normal sn ii - p may come from moderate mass progenitors ( m@xmath5312m@xmath5 ) in the red supergiant phase .",
    "we can not dismiss lower mass progenitors ( less than approximately 15m@xmath5 ) at any stage of their evolutionary lives .",
    "however _ single _ stars in this mass range are unlikely to lose their hydrogen atmospheres before they reach the end of their lives , and so it is virtually inconceivable that they produce sne  ic .",
    "the prediscovery images are not sensitive to all typical magnitudes of wr stars .",
    "we stopped the shaded region in fig.2 at the edge of the o - star main - sequence ( zams mass of 85m@xmath5  and @xmath54=48000k ) , to consider the wr region separately .",
    "wolf - rayet stars span a large range in absolute magnitudes .",
    "for example , in the galaxy and the lmc they have continuum magnitudes in the range @xmath55 although it is only rarely that they have magnitudes at the brighter end of this range @xcite . however these magnitudes are measured with narrow - band filters to sample continuum regions free from the characteristic broad , strong emission lines filters often used are typically 100  wide and centred near 3650 , 4270  and 5160respectively ] .",
    "magnitude differences @xmath56 and @xmath57 can be up to @xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively for wc stars",
    "i.e. the strongest line wc stars could be @xmath60 brighter in @xmath27 than the @xcite @xmath61 magnitudes . taking that sample as representative",
    ", our sensitivity limit of @xmath62 should permit the detection of roughly 30% of wr stars . assuming a @xmath63 is appropriate for wr stars @xcite",
    ", then eqn.1 suggests an upper limit to the luminosity of a wr star progenitor of @xmath64 . applying the approximate mass - luminosity relation for wr stars from @xcite",
    ", this corresponds to an initial upper mass limit of @xmath640m@xmath5 .",
    "these approximate numbers rule out a very high mass wr progenitor , but about 70% of typical wr stars",
    "( of initial masses less than @xmath640m@xmath5 ) would not be detected and so are viable progenitors .",
    "@xcite have presented a preliminary model of the early evolution of sn  2002ap , finding a kinetic energy of @xmath65ergs and an ejected heavy element mass of m@xmath66m@xmath5 .",
    "they suggest that this is most consistent with an explosion of a @xmath65m@xmath5  c+o star , which would have had an initial main - sequence mass of m@xmath67m@xmath5 .",
    "the explosion was less energetic than that of sne  1998bw or 1997ef ( @xmath68ergs ; * ? ? ? * ) although the very broad spectral features indicate that sn  2002ap is of similar nature to these hypernovae .",
    "our non - detection forces us to conclude that a m@xmath69m@xmath5  progenitor star must either have been in an evolutionary phase hotter than @xmath615000k ( or else we would have detected it on the prediscovery images - see fig.2 ) , or the star did not go through classical single star evolution .",
    "given that the progenitor must have lost its hydrogen envelope to become a type  ic , a m@xmath69m@xmath5progenitor in an interacting binary system appears to be the most consistent explanation for the progenitor non - detection and the c+o core mass inferred in the @xcite analysis .",
    "as discussed above , the prediscovery images would not be sensitive to the majority of wr stars , and on this basis alone we can not rule them out . at lmc",
    "type metallicity , wr stars should have initial masses of @xmath7030m@xmath5@xcite , and final c+o cores of @xmath610m@xmath5 .",
    "although this appears a factor of two higher than inferred from the the @xcite explosion models , the final masses of wr stars are somewhat uncertain , and could be as low as 7m@xmath5  @xcite . also as noted above",
    ", the metallicity of the 2002ap region we have adopted is not definitive and _ could _ be close to solar , which would result in a lower initial mass for wr formation , and a slight lowering of the core mass . given all of these uncertainties we can not distinguish between the single wr scenario and the progenitor being a @xmath71m@xmath5  star in an interacting binary system which has had its outer h - rich envelope removed due to mass transfer .",
    "the latter scenario was first theoretically suggested by @xcite and the observational work of @xcite on the association of type ii , ib and ic events with massive hii regions supports the idea that the progenitors of sne ib and ic could be interacting binary stars , rather than initially very massive stars which have reached the wr phase .",
    "the results of this paper together with those of @xcite may suggest a similar origin for sn  2002ap . in comparison ,",
    "hydrodynamic modelling of the lightcurve and spectra of sn  1998bw suggests the explosion of a 14m@xmath5  c+o star which is the core of a star of initial mass 40m@xmath5@xcite .",
    "this could certainly be a wr star , although sn  1998bw was too distant to allow constraints on its progenitor from prediscovery images .",
    "the position of sn  2002ap is @xmath40 ( or 80pc ) away from the bright object clearly detected in the @xmath39 images shown in fig.1 , with only a a faint sign of the object in the @xmath72band . at h@xmath30",
    "there is weak , possibly extended emission although the sn position is clearly not coincident with any nebular flux .",
    "this object has magnitudes ( again measured with respect to the calibration of henden 2002 ) @xmath73 .",
    "this source shows some evidence of being more extended than the typical point - spread - function of the image , although the resolution and variable background are such that much higher resolution images are required to determine its exact nature . assuming a similar extinction to this object as for the supernova , it has @xmath74 , and colours which would be consistent with it being a very luminous _ single _",
    "supergiant star of type late a or f with a mass roughly of @xmath640m@xmath5 .",
    "alternatively it could be an unresolved cluster with a diameter similar to , or less than , the seeing disk i.e. roughly 100pc .",
    "it is unlikely that massive stars form individually , and one would expect that if a wr star or 20 - 25m@xmath5  initial mass binary component was the progenitor then an accompanying population of stars of lower or equivalent mass should be seen .",
    "the absolute @xmath27-magnitude of this object is roughly consistent with a star cluster with a mass @xmath75m@xmath5  ( from the galaxy isochrone synthesis spectral evolution library ( gissel ) of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although its colours are somewhat redder than one would expect from a young cluster of age less than @xmath6100myrs .",
    "the depth of the @xmath76-band is rather too shallow to constrain individual stellar objects .",
    "however the lack of any significant flux shows that there is no large scale starforming region enshrouded in dust , which could be host to an optically hidden large population of massive stars .",
    "once sn  2002ap has faded significantly , it is imperative that deep , high resolution images are taken of its environment .",
    "ideally this should be done with the _ hubble space telescope_. with the _ advanced camera for surveys _ one could resolve the nature of this object , and construct an accurate cmd ( down to @xmath77 in a very modest amount of time ) to constrain the star formation history of this region . if it remains a single object then detection of lower mass stars in this region will still produce an extinction map from multi - colour photometry .",
    "furthermore , if the progenitor was part of an interacting binary system , it is likely that the companion is a fairly massive star and may be detectable in deep images several years from now .",
    "in summary , the prediscovery images allow significant constraints to be placed on the nature of the progenitor of the nearest typeic supernova ( and probable hypernova ) to have occurred in modern times .",
    "we can rule out various evolutionary states of massive stars which would be clearly detectable on the pre - explosion images .",
    "these include very high mass ( @xmath78m@xmath5 ) wr stars , although this still leaves roughly 70% of typical wr - types as viable progenitors .",
    "we can not distinguish between the wr model and the death of a star with initial mass @xmath620 - 25m@xmath5  which has had its outer envelope stripped off through mass transfer in a binary system .",
    "however , this unexcluded fraction of wr stars may have too high a final core mass to be consistent with initial models of the supernova energetics .",
    "the galaxy m74 has been imaged by hst , gemini , cfht and wht , however the supernova position does not fall on any of these images .",
    "we have searched all the publicly available archives for deeper , higher resolution images of m74 but have found no superior images to those presented here that include the pre - explosion site of sn  2002ap .",
