    "the remarkable result shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is that this maximum value , @xmath118 , is well above the classical bound @xmath119 and that it is surprisingly independent of the initial temperature of the acoustic mode .",

    "this effect could be ascribed to quantum interference phenomena , and opens the way for the demonstration of quantum teleportation of states of macroscopic systems . however , thermal noise has still important effects so that , in practice , any experimental implementation needs an acoustic mode cooled at low temperatures ( see however refs .",

    "in fact , we see from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that by increasing @xmath116 , the useful time interval becomes narrower .",
    "that means the necessity of designing precise driving laser pulses in order to have a well defined interaction time .",
    "furthermore , the time interval within which the classical communication from alice to bob , and the phase space displacement by bob have to be made , becomes shorter and shorter with increasing temperature , because the vibrational state projected by alice s bell measurement heats up in a time of the order of @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the mechanical damping constant .",
    "the effects of mechanical damping can be instead neglected during the back - scattering process stimulated by the intense laser beam .",
    "in fact , mechanical damping rates of about @xmath122 hz are available , and therefore negligible with respect to the typical values of the coupling constants @xmath123 hz , and @xmath124 hz , determining the hamiltonian dynamics ( see methods ) .",
    "such values are obtained with the following choice of parameters : @xmath125w , @xmath126 hz , @xmath127 hz , @xmath128 hz , @xmath129 hz , and @xmath130 kg , which are those used in fig .",
    "these parameters are slightly different from those of already performed optomechanical experiments @xcite . however , using a thinner silica crystal and considering higher frequency modes , the parameters we choose could be obtained .",
    "these choices show the difficulties one meets in trying to extend genuine quantum effects as teleportation into the macroscopic domain .",
    "the continuous variable teleportation protocol presented here modifies the standard one of refs .",
    "@xcite by adding a heterodyne measurement on the `` spectator '' mode @xmath60 .",
    "this additional measurement performed by alice is important because it significantly improves the teleportation protocol .",
    "in fact , it is easy to see that if no measurement is performed on the anti - stokes mode , the resulting fidelity for the teleportation of coherent states is always smaller with respect to that with the heterodyne measurement . in particular , there is still a maximum value of the fidelity , @xmath131 in this case , independent of temperature , but the useful interaction time interval becomes much narrower for increasing temperature .",
    "it is worth remarking that the present teleportation scheme provides also a very powerful _ cooling _",
    "mechanism for the acoustic mode . as matter of fact ,",
    "its effective number of thermal excitations soon after the two homodyne measurements at alice station becomes @xmath132 .",
    "it reduces to @xmath133 in absence of entanglement , where @xmath47 represents the noise introduced by the protocol . instead , the optomechanical interaction for a proper time permits to achieve @xmath134 , i.e. , an @xmath135 reduction of thermal noise at once , at the moment of alice s measurement ,",
    "thanks to the entanglement . to this end , the classical communication and the phase space displacement at bob s site are unnecessary , since they do not affect the state variances .    in conclusion , we have proposed a simple scheme to teleport an unknown quantum state of a radiation field onto a macroscopic , collective vibrational degree of freedom of a massive mirror .",
    "the basic resource of entanglement is attained by means of the optomechanical coupling provided by the radiation pressure .",
    "here we have shown the teleportation of the quantum information contained in an unknown quantum state of a radiation field to a collective degree of freedom of a massive object .",
    "this scheme could be easily extended in principle to realize a transfer of quantum information between two massive objects .",
    "in fact victor could use tomographic reconstruction schemes , again based on the ponderomotive interaction ( see @xcite ) , to `` read '' the quantum state of a vibrational mode of another mirror and use this information to prepare the state of the radiation field to be sent to alice .",
    "the present result could be challenging tested with present technology , and opens new perspectives towards the use of quantum mechanics in macroscopic world .",
    "for example , we recognize possible technological applications such as the preparation of nonclassical states of micro - electro - mechanical systems ( mems ) @xcite , where the oscillation frequency could be higher and , consequently , the working temperature can be raised ."
