    "the rotational velocity and luminosity of disk galaxies are found to be strongly correlated ( roberts  1975 ; tully & fisher 1977 ) .",
    "this scaling relation  the `` tully  fisher ( tf ) relation ''  provides a powerful tool to tackle such problems as deriving 0 ( pierce & tully 1988 ) , or mapping the local galaxy streaming motions ( aaronson  1986 ) .",
    "these studies have been confined to nearby galaxies by the use of single dish  radio observations ( haynes & giovanelli 1991 ) or optical emission line spectra ( rubin  1985 ; mathewson  1992 ) .",
    "extending velocity width studies to more distant galaxies would be particularly valuable to investigate galaxy evolution ( kron 1986 ; van der kruit & pickles 1988 ) .",
    "current galaxy evolution models range from those with mild amounts of luminosity brightening in the past ( gronwall & koo 1995 ) to those requiring more dramatic changes ( broadhurst  1988 , colless  1990 , glazebrook  1995 ) to explain the large numbers of faint blue galaxies . by comparing a distant sample of rotation curves to local tf relations",
    ", we can directly constrain the global brightening of disk galaxies in the past .",
    "the  tully  fisher method is limited by the sensitivity of current radio telescopes to  @xmath0 0.1 . beyond this , two approaches have been used .",
    "vogt  ( 1993 ) derived rotation curves from strong optical emission lines , for two spirals at  @xmath10  0.2 . without spatial resolution , an alternative measure of distant spiral kinematics may be extracted from the velocity widths of emission lines .",
    "forbes  ( 1996 ) measured velocity widths for a sample of 18 faint field galaxies with redshifts 0.2  @xmath11  @xmath11  0.84 , while colless  ( 1994 ) examined the equivalent widths of  for a sample of 26 field galaxies with redshifts 0.1  @xmath0  @xmath0  0.7 .",
    "this paper presents rotation curves for nine field galaxies at redshifts 0.1  @xmath0  @xmath0  1 .",
    "this project combines spatially  resolved spectra from the 10  m  keck telescope with inclinations and position angles determined from the refurbished _",
    "hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) .",
    "these data provide a first glimpse into the internal kinematics of galaxies out to a redshift of  @xmath10  1 , or one  third to one  half ( for @xmath12 = 1 - 0 ) of the age of the universe .",
    "two galaxies were observed in 1994 september as part of a program described in forbes  ( 1996 ) .",
    "the other seven galaxies were studied in 1995 may ( see koo  1996 for details ) as part of the deep extragalactic evolutionary probe project ( deep ; mould 1993 ; koo 1995 ) .",
    "wfpc2 images are available for both programs in the f606w ( ) and f814w ( ) filters .",
    "spectra were acquired with the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ; oke  1995 ) .",
    "the red - blazed 600 line mm@xmath4 grating and a 2048@xmath132048 pixel ccd with scales of 1.26    and 0215 per pixel were used .",
    "the four brightest galaxies were observed in long  slit mode with a 10 slit for 30 minutes each .",
    "the other five were observed through a multi  object slitmask with a slit width of 125 and exposures totalling 1  3 hours .",
    "seeing was approximately 08 and 095 ( fwhm ) for the 1994 and 1995 observations , respectively .",
    "the spectral range varied between 4800  7400  for the forbes  objects , 6200 ",
    "8800    for the remaining long  slit observations , and approximately 7800    ",
    "1.0  for the slitmask data . since the primary goal for all the spectroscopic observations was to obtain redshifts , no attempt was made to align the slits with the major axis of each galaxy .",
    "consequently , we must consider the effects of slit misalignment during the analysis .",
    "pixel  to  pixel variations were removed by subtraction of a constant bias level and division with flat ",
    "fields generated from dome ",
    "flat images taken with the grating but _ without _ a slit .",
    "the lris ccd suffers from fringing at a level of up to 5% peak  to  peak in the far red , so the spectra were also divided by an appropriate fringing flat taken through the same slits and grating angles as the observations .",
    "this reduces fringing by a factor of four , but fringing still remains a problem in the presence of strong night ",
    "sky lines .",
    "the slitmask spectra were then corrected for slit profile variations due to small irregularities along the slit edges , and for instrumental distortions as determined from night  sky emission lines and the ends of slitlets .",
    "wavelength calibrations were based on the stronger night  sky oh emission lines ( vogt 1995 ) .",
    "the spectra were then examined for spatially  extended emission lines .",
    "seven of the 41 objects in the may 1995 redshift survey ( koo  1996 ) had such lines , and they were augmented with the two spatially  resolved sources from forbes  ( 1996 ) .",
    "the hst images were reduced using iraf - based reduction and analysis techniques ( forbes  1994 ; phillips  1996 ) .",
    "total magnitudes and colors were measured from aperture growth curves from  and  data ; inclination and position angles were estimated from the outer elliptical isophotes , and disk scale lengths were measured along the major axis as part of bulge  to  disk decompositions .",
    "error estimates are noted in table  1 , and discussed in detail in phillips  1996 .      to improve the signal  to  noise ratio ( s / n ) , the raw rotation curves were smoothed with a 3pixel ( 065 ) boxcar along the spatial axis before measurement . at each position along the slit",
    ", we then fit gaussian profiles to the strongest emission lines observed , ranging from  for the lowest - objects through  and the line , to the doublet for sources with  @xmath10  1 . the fitting algorithm ( vogt 1995 )",
    "derives the position , amplitude , width , and a linear background for a best  fit single gaussian ( double gaussian for the  doublet , with rest frame centers fixed at 3726.2 and 3728.9   ) , and calculates s / n for these parameters .",
    "three galaxies were spatially extended in more than one emission line , and a weighted average rotation velocity was calculated .",
    "a velocity profile was calculated wherever the gaussian fit met certain minimum requirements in profile height and width ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) ; the typical value was @xmath16 for both width and amplitude fits ( see details in vogt 1995 ) .",
    "the widths were also constrained to a physically reasonable range ( 1 - 10   ) . the faint galaxy 064@xmath174412 required a relaxation of height and width requirements to @xmath18 ( with typical values of @xmath15 ) as the  line strength was quite weak .",
    "determining the rotation curves of these distant galaxies poses some special difficulties not encountered with nearby galaxies .",
    "the galaxies are typically not much larger than the seeing disk ( @xmath100810 ) or the slit  width ( 10125 ) , so the resultant spectra represent a complex combination of the spatial distribution in both velocity and emission line surface brightness .",
    "moreover , the slit is usually misaligned with the major axis .    to interpret the data , we adopt a simple exponential disk model for each source , where the inclination and orientation relative to the slit matches measurements from the hst images .",
    "the velocities in the model are assumed to rise linearly with radius out to one disk scale length , and then to remain flat ( persic & salucci 1991 ) .",
    "the spatial distribution of the emission ",
    "line flux is assumed to follow the disk ( kennicutt 1989 ) , although ryder & dopita ( 1994 ) find a longer scale length than that of the continuum flux .",
    "thus , a scale length of 1.5 times that measured from the hst images was used .",
    "the model was then convolved with an appropriate gaussian to approximate the seeing , masked with a model slit , and a spectral line profile calculated at each pixel along the slit .",
    "the resulting model emission line was subjected to the same analysis as the observed lines .",
    "iterative adjustments to the circular velocity of the model were made manually until the simulated and observed emission lines matched at the velocity extremes .",
    "the model circular velocity , @xmath19 , was then adopted as the intrinsic terminal velocity , , of the galaxy .",
    "the @xmath18 errors in  shown in figure  [ tf ] were estimated by varying the inclination and position angle of each galaxy by @xmath20  10  and adopting the extrema .",
    "varying the distance to the elbow radius of the modeled rotation curve by 25% had a minimal effect upon the value of .",
    "although the model was adjusted in amplitude to fit the velocities in the outer regions of the galaxies , in most cases it provided a good fit at all galactocentric radii .",
    "the data for the nine sample galaxies are listed in table  1 .",
    "coordinates can be found for all galaxies in koo  ( 1996 ) and forbes  ( 1966 ) .",
    "we assume and 0  = 0 , though unphysical , to set upper limits on luminosity evolution .",
    "restframe @xmath21 luminosities were derived from the    color and redshift to select a model ( non  evolving ) spectral energy distribution from the set described in gronwall & koo ( 1995 ) .",
    "the models are based on those of bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) .",
    "galaxies were corrected for galactic extinction , assuming extinction at  is 0.45 a@xmath22 and at  is 0.67 a@xmath22 , and for internal extinction , following the methods of tully & fouqu ( 1985 ) and rubin  ( 1985 ) , as listed in table  1 .",
    "these extinction corrections were applied consistently with the authors prescriptions , to facilitate our final comparisons to local tf relations .",
    "images of the galaxies ( figure  [ plate ] ( plates xx12 ) ) show them to be mainly normal spirals , except for 0305@xmath1700114 which has double nuclei , and a few others with asymmetries . figure  [ plate ] also shows the observed rotation curves , the size and orientation of each slit , and the adopted model rotation curves fit to the data .",
    "the caption includes notes for individual galaxies , but 074@xmath172262 deserves special comment .",
    "this low luminosity galaxy resembles a highly  inclined , late  type barred spiral with obvious spiral arms , bright knots of star - forming regions , and highly elongated outer isophotes , but the lack of radial velocity variations greater than @xmath20 25  precludes a highly inclined disk .",
    "the object is asymmetric , shows signs of tidal disturbance , and has a possible perturbing companion 10  away on the sky .",
    "it is also possible that this is a merger in progress between two dwarf galaxies , observed perpendicular to the path of collision .",
    "this galaxy serves to illustrate that even at low redshifts , in any randomly selected sample of galaxies there exist `` disk '' galaxies quite unsuitable for study via the tf relation .",
    "an immediate  although not surprising  result is that the shapes of the rotation curves of these high redshift galaxies are similar to those of local galaxies .",
    "the high - redshift rotation curves are relatively symmetric , show a `` solid - body '' rise in the inner regions , and turnover to a relatively constant circular velocity in the outer parts .",
    "the maximum velocities ( see table  1 ) are comparable to those of local spirals .",
    "rough calculations yield masses between 1 and 5 @xmath13 @xmath23 @xmath24 , well within the range of masses found for nearby spiral galaxies .",
    "this result , combined with the apparent disks which are obvious in the hst images , shows conclusively that some _ massive _ disk systems were in place by  @xmath10 1 .    in figure  [ tf ]",
    "we compare the data to local tf relations in the rest ",
    "frame @xmath25-band , which corresponds to  at  @xmath10 0.4 and to  at  @xmath10 0.8 ( the @xmath26 corrections are small ) .",
    "the comparison in figure  [ tf]@xmath27 is to the tf relation ( inverse fit ,  as a function of @xmath28 ) for 32 spiral galaxies in the ursa major cluster ( pierce & tully 1988 , 1992 ) .",
    "this relationship is based on  velocity width measurements ( corrected for turbulent broadening ) , but we have not converted our optical ",
    "line terminal velocities to radio widths since this correction ( @xmath0  15  ) is small compared to the optical error ( mathewson  1992 ; giovanelli  1996 ) .",
    "the two sources with redshift  @xmath10  0.2 from vogt  ( 1993 ) are plotted for comparison ; with only ground  based imaging available , they are less well constrained in inclination . excluding these and the peculiar source 074@xmath172262 , we compute a weighted offset of 0.55  @xmath20  0.15 mag relative to the @xmath25-band tf relation of pierce & tully , with a dispersion of 0.71 mag .",
    "this dispersion matches the quadratic summation of errors ( 0.65 ) in the logarithmic velocity widths ( 0.47 ) , the rest ",
    "frame @xmath25 magnitudes ( 0.2 ) , and an assumed intrinsic scatter in the tf relation ( 0.4 ) ( willick  1996 and references therein ) , indicating that our error estimates are consistent .",
    "an analogous calculation for the @xmath29-band relation yields an offset of 0.36  @xmath20  0.18  mag .",
    "figure  [ tf]@xmath30 shows the same galaxies and the tf relation ( double regression fit ) for local field galaxies of hubble types sa , sb , and sc as published in rubin  ( 1985 ) , corrected to . since our galaxy types ( see table  1 ) are evenly distributed between sb and sc , we compare to a local relation midway between the sb and sc , and measure an offset of 0.38  @xmath20  0.22  mag .",
    "several sample selection effects and assumptions work to make these offsets upper limits .",
    "first , at high redshift , our samples are biased toward intrinsically luminous galaxies , which will affect somewhat our results with respect to tf relations ( teerikorpi 1984 ) .",
    "second , we have selected spatially - extended objects , which will bias our sample toward larger galaxies .",
    "third , we have selected objects with detectable emission lines , which will bias the sample toward galaxies with stronger than average star formation  and therefore higher luminosity .",
    "corrections for these biases would all _ reduce _ the true offsets .",
    "moreover , if we have not traced the rotation curve to sufficiently large radii , we may have underestimated the maximum velocities , and if galaxies were less dusty at earlier epochs , we may have overcorrected for extinction .",
    "these errors , if present , would also _ reduce _ the true offsets . finally , adopting 0  = 0.5 instead of 0",
    "= 0 would decrease the restframe luminosities by 0.1  0.4 magnitudes , and again reduce the true offset .",
    "the issue of a representative local tf sample for comparison is also critical .",
    "key factors include the photometry passband , the observations and analysis used to determine internal velocities , the selection biases due to catalog limits , the distortions due to peculiar velocities , internal extinction corrections , and the tf fitting technique ( forward , inverse , or double regression ) .",
    "note , however , that our sample lies in the central region ( @xmath31 , @xmath32  @xmath33 ) of the range fit in the local samples , where the differences between various fits are minimized .",
    "we assume an error due to these effects of 0.35 mag and combine this with the measured uncertainties in our offsets ( @xmath34 ) from local tf relations to arrive at an upper limit of @xmath2m@xmath35 mag .    in summary",
    ", we find an offset relative to local tf relations of @xmath2m@xmath36 mag as a strong upper limit .",
    "we do _ not _ see an obvious trend with redshift or morphological type , but our sample is small .",
    "our result is compatible with other kinematic studies of field galaxies at intermediate redshifts , such as rix  ( 1996 ) , who find a brightening of 0.44 mag for blue field galaxies at  @xmath10 0.3 .",
    "forbes  ( 1996 ) concluded that galaxies near  @xmath10 0.5 show a surface brightness increase of 0.6 @xmath20 0.1 mag , while schade  ( 1995 ) find a 1.2 @xmath20 0.25 mag increase in disky galaxies at redshifts 0.5 @xmath11  @xmath11 1.2 .",
    "since the average bulge  to  total ratio for the schade  sample is @xmath10 0.1 , any reductions due to a significant bulge would be small . while the samples are not directly comparable , our data suggest somewhat less brightening and exclude any total ( versus surface ) brightening by more than 1.5 magnitudes at the 99% cl .",
    "the results can be reconciled if disky galaxies of similar mass were not much brighter at  @xmath10 1 than today but had slightly smaller disk scale lengths and thus higher surface brightness .",
    "this letter presents first results in the investigation of kinematics via rotation curves in high redshift galaxies .",
    "we plan future observations to increase the sample size , and will constrain slits to lie within 30  of the major axes .",
    "we will use this larger , higher ",
    "quality data set to focus on a better understanding of sample selection biases , and will further explore a more analogous local tf relation .",
    "nevertheless , the current data clearly indicate that optical rotation curves can be measured up to  @xmath10 1 and will provide an important constraint on our understanding of the evolution of disk galaxies .",
