    "the quest for a unified theory of elementary particles has led to numerous extensions of the successful standard model ( sm ) of electroweak and strong interactions . during the last decades",
    ", string theory has been proven to be a powerful approach to describing gravity , which also enforces restrictions on the particle physics theory .",
    "grand unified theories ( guts )  @xcite may be embedded in string scenarios , while supersymmetry ( susy ) is also incorporated in a consistent way , leading to a natural solution of the hierarchy problem .",
    "although string theory does not provide a unique prediction for the precise gut symmetry and matter content , it enables a classification of possible solutions in a well defined and organised way .",
    "moreover , it provides computational tools for various parameters such as the yukawa couplings and potentials which would otherwise be left unspecified in more arbitrary extensions of the standard model .",
    "among other restrictions imposed by string theory principles , of particular importance are those on the massless spectrum . in many string constructions only small representations such as the fundamental and spinorial of the gut group are available while the adjoint or higher ones are absent in the massless spectrum .",
    "in some cases this puts model building in a precarious position since the spontaneous breaking of most successful guts requires higgs fields in the adjoint representation .",
    "but it was precisely this difficulty which gave rise to the invention of new symmetry breaking mechanisms and other alternative ways to obtain the standard model . in the case of @xmath0 for example",
    "@xcite , one manages to circumvent this obstacle by replacing it with the flipped -@xmath9- version of the model  @xcite,@xcite , while in the case of pati - salam symmetry @xmath10  @xcite the adjoint higgs field , which transforms under the gauge group as @xmath11 , is replaced by the vector - like higgs pair of fields which transform as @xmath12  @xcite,@xcite .",
    "analogously , a way out of this difficulty in f - theory models  @xcite , where the singularity is realised on a del pezzo surface , is the use of fluxes to break the gut symmetry .",
    "indeed , in the last decade or so , a considerable amount of work has been devoted to the possibility of successfully embedding guts such as @xmath0 as well as exceptional @xmath13 in an f - theory framework , leading to new features @xcite .",
    "recently , some of us have analysed various phenomenological aspects of f - theory effective models using the spectral cover description  @xcite .",
    "while , in f - constructions , r - parity conservation ( rpc ) can emerge either as a remnant symmetry of extra @xmath2 factors , or it can be imposed by appealing to some geometric property of the internal manifold and the flux @xcite , and there is no compelling reason to assume this .",
    "moreover , experimental bounds permit r - parity violating ( rpv ) interactions at small but non - negligible rates , providing a generic signature of f - theory models . in the field theory context , rpv proved to be the _ achilles heel _ of many susy guts .",
    "the most dangerous such couplings induce the tree - level operators @xmath14 and in the absence of a suitable symmetry or displacement mechanism , all of them appearing simultaneously can lead to baryon and lepton ( b and l ) violating processes at unacceptable rates  @xcite . on the other hand , in f - theory constructions ,",
    "parts of gut multiplets are typically projected out by fluxes , giving rise only to a part of the above operators . in other cases , due to symmetry arguments ,",
    "the yukawa couplings relevant to rpv operators are identically zero . as a result , several b / l violating processes , either are completely prevented or occur at lower rates in f - theory models , providing a controllable signal of rpv .",
    "this observation motivates a general study of rpv in f - theory , which is the subject of this paper .    in the present paper ,",
    "then , we consider rpv in local f - theory , trying to be as general as possible , with the goal of making a bridge between f - theory and experiment",
    ". an important goal of the paper is to compute the strength of the rpv yukawas couplings , which mainly depend on the topological properties of the internal space and are more or less independent of many details of a particular model , enabling us to work in a generic local f - theory setting .",
    "we focus on f - theory su(5 ) constructions , where a displacement mechanism , based on non - trivial fluxes , renders several gut multiplets incomplete .",
    "this mechanism has already been suggested to eliminate the colour triplets from the higgs five - plets , so that dangerous dimension-5 proton decay operators are not present .",
    "however , it turns out that , in several cases , not only the higgs but also other matter multiplets are incomplete , while the superpotential structure is such that it implies rpv terms . in this context , it is quite common that not all of the rpv operators appear simultaneously , allowing observable rpv effects without disastrous proton decay .",
    "our goal in this paper is twofold .",
    "firstly , to present a detailed analysis of all possible combinations of rpv operators arising from a generic semi - local f - theory spectral cover framework , assuming an @xmath0 gut .",
    "this includes a detailed analysis of the classification of all possible allowed combinations of rpv operators , originating from the @xmath0 term @xmath1 , including the effect of @xmath2 fluxes , with _",
    "global _ restrictions , which are crucial in controlling the various possible multiplet splittings . secondly ,",
    "using f - theory techniques developed in the last few years , we perform explicit computations of the bottom / tau and rpv yukawa couplings , assuming only _ local _ restrictions on fluxes , and comparing our results with the present experimental limits on the coupling for each specific rpv operator .",
    "the ingredients for this study have already appeared scattered through the literature , which we shall refer to as we go along .",
    "we emphasise that the first goal is related to the nature of the available _ global _ abelian fluxes of the particular model and their restrictions on the various matter curves , hence , on its specific geometric properties .",
    "the second goal requires the computation of the strengths of the corresponding yukawa couplings .",
    "this in turn requires knowledge of the wavefunctions profiles of the particles participating in the corresponding trilinear yukawa couplings and , as we will see , these involve the _ local _ flux data .",
    "once such couplings exist in the effective lagrangian , we wish to explore the regions of the available parameter space where these couplings are sufficiently suppressed and are compatible with the present experimental data .",
    "our aim in this dedicated study is to develop and extend the scope of the existing results in the literature , in order to provide a complete and comprehensive study , which make direct contact with experimental limits on rpv , enabling f - theory models to be classified and confronted with experiment more easily and directly than previously .",
    "we emphasise that this is the first study of its kind in the literature which focusses exclusively on rpv in f - theory .",
    "the remainder of the paper divides into two parts : in the first part , we consider semi - local f - theory constructions where global restrictions are imposed on the fluxes , which imply that they take integer values . in section",
    "[ semi - local ] we show that rpv is a generic expectation of semi - local f - theory constructions . in section",
    "[ curves ] we classify f - theory @xmath0 models in the spectral cover approach according to the type of monodromy which dictates the different curves on which the matter and higgs fields can lie , with particular attention of the possibility for rpv operators in each case at the level of @xmath1 operators , involving complete @xmath0 multiplets , focussing on which multiplets contain the higgs fields @xmath15 and @xmath16 . in section  [ flux ]",
    "we introduce the notion of flux , quantised according to global restrictions , which , when switched on , leads to incomplete @xmath0 multiplets in the low energy ( massless ) spectrum , focussing on missing components of the multiplets projected out by the flux , and tabulating the type of physical process ( rpv or proton decay ) can result from particular operators involving different types of incomplete multiplets .",
    "appendix  [ app : rpv ] details all possible sources of r - parity violating couplings for all models classified with respect to the monodromies in semi - local f - theory constructions .    in the second part of the paper , we relax the global restrictions of the semi - local constructions , and allow the fluxes to take general values , subject only to local restrictions .",
    "in section  [ yuk ] we describe the calculation of a yukawa coupling originating from an operator @xmath1 at an @xmath3 local point of enhancement in the presence of general local fluxes , with only local ( not global ) flux restrictions . in section  [ num ]",
    "we apply these methods to calculate the numerical values of yukawa couplings for bottom , tau and rpv operators , exploring the parameter space of local fluxes . in section  [ rpv ]",
    "we finally consider rpv coupling regions and calculate ratios of yukawa couplings from which the physical rpv couplings at the gut scale can be determined and compared to limits on these couplings from experiment .",
    "section  [ conclusions ] concludes the paper .",
    "appendix  [ app : localchirality ] details the local f - theory constructions and local chirality constraints on flux data and rpv operators .",
    "in the present f - theory framework of @xmath0 gut , third generation fermion masses are expected to arise from the tree - level superpotential terms @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where the index @xmath20 stands for fermion , @xmath21 for higgs and we have introduced the notation 10_f=(q , u^c , e^c ) , |5_f = ( d^c , l ) , 1_f=^c , 5_h=(d , h_u ) , |5=(|d , h_d ) [ mssmrpv ] the lighter generations receive masses from higher order terms , involving the same invariants , although suppressed by powers of @xmath22 , with @xmath23 representing available singlet fields with non - zero vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) , while @xmath24 is the gut scale . the 4-d rpv couplings are obtained similarly with the replacements @xmath25 ( provided that the symmetries of the theory permit the existence of such terms ) . at the level of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) superpotential the rpv couplings read  @xcite : @xmath26 in the conventional notation for matter multiplets @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a flavour index . notice that in the presence of vector - like pairs , @xmath29 , additional rpv couplings appear from the following decompositions [ eq : wrpv2 ] w 10_f10_f5_f qu^c|l+ u^c |d^c e^c+12 ",
    "qq|d^c where we have introduced the notation @xmath30 and dropped the flavour indices here for simplicity .",
    "however , as we will analyse in detail , abelian fluxes and additional continuous or discrete symmetries which are always present in f - theory models , eliminate several of these terms .",
    "we will perform the analysis in the context of the spectral surfaces whose covering group is @xmath31 ( dubbed usually as perpendicular ) and is identified as the commutant to the gut @xmath32 in the chain @xmath33 where @xmath34 is assumed to be the highest singularity in the elliptically fibred compact space . then",
    ", a crucial rle on the rpv remaining terms in the effective superpotential is played by the specific assignment of fermion and higgs fields on the various matter curves and the remaining perpendicular @xmath35 s after the monodromy action .    a classification of the set of models with simple monodromies that retain some perpendicular @xmath35 charges associated with the weights",
    "@xmath36 has been put forward in  @xcite , where we follow the notation of dudas and palti@xcite . in the following , we categorize these models in order to assess whether tree - level , renormalizable , perturbative rpv is generic if matter is allocated in different curves .",
    "more specifically , we present four classes , characterised by the splitting of the spectral cover equation .",
    "these are :    * @xmath37-splitting , which retains three independent perpendicular @xmath35 .",
    "these models represent a @xmath38 monodromy ( @xmath39 ) , and as expected we are left with seven @xmath40 curves , and four @xmath41 curves . *",
    "@xmath42-splitting , which retains two independent perpendicular @xmath35 .",
    "these models represent a @xmath43 monodromy ( @xmath39 , @xmath44 ) , and as expected we are left with five @xmath40 curves , and three @xmath41 curves . *",
    "@xmath45-splitting , which retains two independent perpendicular @xmath35 .",
    "these models represent a @xmath46 monodromy ( @xmath47 ) , and as expected we are left with five @xmath40 curves , and three @xmath41 curves .",
    "* @xmath48-splitting , which retains a single perpendicular @xmath35 .",
    "these models represent a @xmath49 monodromy ( @xmath47 , @xmath50 ) , and as expected we are left with three @xmath40 curves , and two @xmath41 curves .    in appendix  [ app : rpv ]",
    "we develop the above classes of models , identifying which curve contains the higgs fields and which contains the matter fields , in order to show that rpv is a generic phenomenon in semi - local f - theory constructions .",
    "of course , if all the rpv operators are present , then proton decay will be an inevitable consequence . in the next subsection",
    "we show that this is generally avoided in semi - local f - theory constructions when fluxes are switched on , which has the effect of removing some of the rpv operators , while leaving some observable rpv in the low energy spectrum .      in f - theory guts , when the adjoint representation is not found in the massless spectrum , the alternative mechanism of flux breaking",
    "is introduced to reduce the gut symmetry down to the sm gauge group . in the case of @xmath0",
    "this can happen by turning on a non - trivial flux along the hypercharge generator in the internal directions .",
    "at the same time , the various components of the gut multiplets living on matter curves , interact differently with the hypercharge flux . as a result ,",
    "in addition to the @xmath0 symmetry breaking , on certain matter curves we expect the splitting of the @xmath51 and @xmath52 representations into different numbers of sm multiplets .    in a minimal scenario",
    "one might anticipate that the hyperflux is non - trivially restricted only on the higgs matter curves in such a way that the zero modes of the colour triplet components are eliminated .",
    "this would be an alternative to the doublet - triplet scenario since only the two higgs doublets remain and the light spectrum .",
    "the occurrence of this minimal scenario presupposes that all other matter curves are left intact by the flux .",
    "however , in this section we show that this is usually not the case .",
    "indeed , the common characteristic of a large class of models derived from the various factorisations of the spectral cover are that there are incomplete @xmath0 multiplets from different matter curves which comprise the three known generations and eventually possible extraneous fields . interestingly , such scenarios leave open the possibility of effective models with only a fraction of rpv operators and the opportunity of studying exciting new physics implications leading to suppressed exotic decays which might be anticipated in the lhc experiments .    to analyse these cases , we assume that @xmath53 integers are units of @xmath2 fluxes , with @xmath54 representing the corresponding hyperflux piercing the matter curves .",
    "the integer nature of these fluxes originates from the assumed _ global _ restrictions  @xcite .",
    "then , the tenplets and fiveplets split according to : _ t_i= \\ {          . [ 5s ] the integers @xmath55 may take any positive or negative value , leading to different number of sm representations , however , for our purposes it is enough to assume the cases @xmath56 . then , substituting these numbers in eqs .",
    "( [ 10s],[5s ] ) we obtain the cases of table  [ table1 ] .",
