    "spectroscopy has exhibited its great importance for diagnostic of laboratory and astrophysical plasmas .",
    "emission lines arising from @xmath9 transitions of b- , c- and n - like ions have been frequently observed in solar extreme - ultraviolet spectra  [ 1 ] .",
    "they have been extensively used to determine electron temperature and/or density of stellar coronae through line intensity ratios .",
    "keenan presented electron density - sensitive ratios for b - like ions including si x , ar xiv and ca xvi etc . for c - like ions including s xi , ca xv , fe xxi and ar xiii , the electron density - sensitive ratios were also given by keenan .",
    "for n - like ions , to our best knowledge , the electron density - sensitive ratios were presented only for s x  [ 9 ] .",
    "using the ratios from these ions lines , accurate electron densities have been obtained , which are consistent with those from iron ions with same temperatures of maximum fractional abundance in ionization equilibrium  [ 10 ] .",
    "another benefit using these line ratios is that the uncertainty due to ionization equilibrium and element abundance has been eliminated .    with the launch of a new generation of x - ray satellites , including _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm _ , a large amount of high quality spectra with high spectral resolution and high effective area have been obtained for nearly all classes of astrophysical x - ray sources  [ 11 - 17 ] .",
    "this will allow us to estimate physical parameters such as the electron temperature and density of the stellar x - ray corona .",
    "the temperature has long been available before the launch of the two satellites , while the density determination of x - ray emitting layer becomes possible until the launch of satellites with the high - spectral resolution .",
    "spatial information of stars could be assessed indirectly from relationship between electron density and emission measure ( @xmath10 ) . for reliable determination of the electron density and temperature ,",
    "accurate atomic data is very important , especially electron impact excitation rates and oscillator strengths  [ 8 ] .",
    "currently , the electron density is mainly determined using triplet line ratios ( resonance , inter - combination and forbidden lines ) of he - like ions for line formation regions .",
    "ness and testa present an extensive investigation using those he - like ions for stars with different activity levels , and disclose that the electron density of stellar coronae does not exceed @xmath11@xmath5 .",
    "one reason of the extensive application of he - like ions is that a larger amount of reliable atomic data is available , because the atomic data calculation of k - shell ions is relatively simple . and some laboratory experiments conducted in tokamak",
    ", electron beam ion traps ( ebit ) and intense laser - matter interaction have been carried to benchmark the theoretical calculation for k - shell ions  [ 20,21 ] .",
    "many l - shell emission lines of iron ions have been detected for star coronae .",
    "the temperature structure of the x - ray emitting layers have been obtained using these iron lines . however , further investigation is still necessary to depict out the structure of the stellar coronae and to explain heating mechanism .    in x - ray spectra of stars with various activity ,",
    "the l - shell emission lines of non - iron elements including si , s , ar and ca have also been detected .",
    "but recent studies revealed that there are large uncertainties for the atomic data of these ions .",
    "fortunately , a large project  emission line project supported by the chandra x - ray observatory , has been opened to complete a comprehensive catalog of astrophysically relevant emission lines in support of new - generation x - ray observatories .",
    "lepson  [ 22 ] recently made an experiment for highly charged ar ions in ebit - ii to benchmark theoretical calculation .",
    "the intensity ratios of the l - shell emission lines of these non - iron ions might be used for direct density estimations of stellar coronae and fusion plasma .",
    "therefore the exploration and calibration of the line intensity ratios of the l - shell emission lines of the non - iron elements , such as si , s , ar and ca , are necessary in the next few years .",
    "argon is an abundant element , and has been detected in solar and solar - like stars , such as capella  [ 13 ] , algol  [ 23 ] and au  mic  [ 24 ] .",
    "for example , the emission lines arising from @xmath12 transitions of ar xvi have been identified by audard  [ 13 ] , and @xmath13 transition lines located near 27.043   of ar xv have also been identified in our previous work  [ 25 ] . in ionization equilibrium condition  [ 10 ] , the temperature of maximum ar xiv fractional abundance has a same value with that of he - like ne .",
    "however the triplets of he - like ne are strongly blended by forest - like features of highly charged fe ions  [ 26 ] .",
    "so the features of ar xiv may give the density information in ne ix ion formation region . at present ,",
    "apec database is the most complete and has been extensively used in x - ray spectral analyses for stars .",
    "in fact apec extends chianti database by including some experimental values of highly charged iron ions . in chianti",
    "database , emission lines of ar xiv are also included .",
    "however all the collision rates are results withs distorted wave ( dw ) approximation and using less configurations . therefore the exploration of the density - sensitive line ratios of highly charged ar xiv using more accurate atomic data will be meaningful .",
    "in this paper we present calculations of electron density - sensitive line intensity ratios of ar xiv in x - ray line formation region .",
    "present calculation of atomic structure includes more configurations than previous work , and some excitation rates are replaced by data from r - matrix method . by comparing these ratios with experimental ones conducted by lepson  [ 22 ] in the lawrence livermore electron beam ion traps ebit - ii , the electron density of the laboratory plasma is determined .",
    "the model ion for ar xiv consists of 152 fine - structure energy levels belonging to the configurations @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20  ( @xmath21 and@xmath22 ) .",
    "electron impact excitation rates are obtained by performing numerical integration of collision strengths over a maxwellian distribution .",
    "the collision strengths among the lowest 152 energy levels , along with the spontaneous radiative decay rates and energy levels were calculated using the flexible atomic code ( fac ) developed by gu  [ 27,28 ] . the atomic structure calculation in fac",
    "is based on the fully relativistic configuration interaction approximation , while the electron impact collision strengths are calculated in the relativistic dw approximation .",
    "these data are available electronically from the authors ( gyliang@bao.ac.cn ) on request . for the electron impact excitation rates among the lowest 15 levels",
    ", we adopted recent results of keenan  [ 8 ] , in which a more accurate method r - matrix ( burke and roob  [ 29 ] ) is adopted . as noted by , for example , seaton  [ 30 ] , excitation by protons will be important for the lowest levels .",
    "this will affect the x - ray emission lines indirectly .",
    "in the present analysis we have employed the rates of foster , keenan @xmath23 reid  [ 31 ] , which were calculated using a close - coupled impact - parameter method .    using the atomic data discussed above in conjunction with rate equations , relative ar xiv level populations were derived for a range of electron temperatures and densities .",
    "the rate equations are given as  [ 25,32,33 ] @xmath24 & = & \\sum_{i > j}n_ia_{ij}+n_e(\\sum_{i < j}n_ic_{ij}^e+\\sum_{i > j}n_ic_{ij}^d ) \\nonumber,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the superscript @xmath25 and @xmath26 refer to electron excitation and deexcitation , @xmath27 is the number density of level @xmath28 , and @xmath1 is the electron density . in the calculations ,",
    "following assumptions were made : ( i ) photon - excitation and de - excitation rates are negligible in comparison with the corresponding collision rates ; ( ii ) ionization to and recombination from other ionic levels are slow compared with bound - bound rates ; ( iii ) the plasma is optically thin .",
    "generally , the line intensity for a given transition line @xmath29 is given by @xmath30    in order to correctly understand the astrophysical spectra , lepson  [ 22 ] carried out an experiment in lawrence livermore electron beam ion traps ebit - ii for ar at three different energies of 600 , 650 and 1000  ev .",
    "this is part of a large project to complete a comprehensive catalog of astrophysically relevant emission lines in support of new - generation x - ray observatories . in this experiment ,",
    "several emission lines of ar xiv were detected , as shown in table 1 .",
    "@xmath31    theoretical predictions of line intensities , including hullac [ 22 ] and fac calculations by us , are also presented .    by resolving rate equations",
    ", we found that the following emission line intensity ratios of ar xiv ion , are sensitive to electron density : @xmath32 therefore they may be useful for the electron density diagnostics for all kinds of hot plasma with sufficient signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "figures 14 show the theoretical line intensity ratios as a function of the electron density at temperature ( log@xmath3(k)=6.5 ) of maximum ar xiv fractional abundance in ionization equilibrium  [ 10 ] .",
    "predictions of ratios @xmath7 and @xmath33 are much larger than one , so the determination of electron density will be very difficult due to extremely faint lines involved .    in these figures ,",
    "the solid lines refer to results using the excitation rates obtained from dw approximation , while the dotted lines refer to results using the excitation rates for the lowest 15 energy levels obtained from r - matrix approximation  [ 8 ] .",
    "the discrepancies between dw and r - matrix calculation reach up to 15% at @xmath1 = @xmath34 @xmath5 , which indicates that the resonance excitation effect is important in the calculation of the electron impact excitation rates .",
    "chianti prediction exhibits a similar result with the fac prediction in density - sensitive region as shown in fig .",
    "1 . for clarity ,",
    "chianti prediction is shown only for ratio @xmath2 .",
    "apec shows similar result with chianti prediction due to same data adopted for ar xiv .",
    "an inspection of the figures also tells us that the ratios are sensitive to the electron density .",
    "for example @xmath2 and @xmath6 , vary by factors of 4.4 and 4.3 respectively , at @xmath1 = @xmath35 and @xmath34 @xmath5 .",
    "moreover the ratio @xmath2 is insensitive to electron temperature .",
    "for example , a change in @xmath3 of 0.2  dex ( i.e. 58% ) leads to a less than 1% variation at @xmath36 @xmath5 , up to 3% at @xmath37 @xmath5 , as show in fig .",
    "the sensitivity of the line intensity ratio @xmath2 to electron density , combined with its insensitivity to @xmath3 , makes it very useful for the density diagnostics for laboratory and astrophysical plasmas .",
    "applying present line intensity ratios , we diagnose the electron density of ar laboratory plasma conducted by lepson  [ 22 ] in ebit - ii . in the experiment , energy of electron beam is fixed at 1.0  kev .",
    "however , the energy will become lower than 1.0  kev when the electrons interact with cold ar gas in trap region .",
    "the temperature of produced ar plasma is not given by lepson . for detailed information of the experiment",
    ", you can refer the paper written by lepson  [ 22 ] .",
    "recently , chen  [ 34 ] measured the electron density ( @xmath38@xmath5 ) of the laboratory plasma using triplet line intensity ratio of he - like n ion .    in table 1",
    ", we present the measured intensities relative to that of the line at 27.469   , along with the theoretical results including the hullac  [ 22 ] and fac calculations by us . in the theoretical calculation , the electron temperature adopted here is log@xmath3(k)=6.5 which corresponds to maximum ar xiv fractional abundance in ionization equilibrium  [ 10 ] , while the electron density is @xmath39@xmath5 . in the ionization equilibrium condition",
    ", the fraction of ar xiv as a function of temperature has a steep peak at log@xmath3(k)=6.5 .",
    "since emissivity almost comes from plasma with this temperature , we assume the produced plasma is isothermal plasma with temperature log@xmath3(k)=6.5 .",
    "table 1 shows that our results are in agreement with experimental measurements and are better than the hullac calculation in wavelength . for the relative intensities ,",
    "our calculation also agree with experimental measurement except for the line at 30.344   .    above section",
    "has shown that the ratio @xmath2 is sensitive to the electron density @xmath1 , while it is insensitive to the electron temperature @xmath3 .",
    "obviously this ratio is a good diagnostic tool for the electron density @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , the laboratory measurement and theoretical calculation indicate that emission lines relevant to the ratio @xmath2 are the strongest lines of ar xiv and not contaminated by other ar lines .",
    "so we can use @xmath2 to diagnose the electron density of the laboratory plasma . by comparison between the measured value and theoretical calculation as shown by the filled diamond in fig .",
    "1 , the electron density @xmath39@xmath5 is derived .",
    "this result is consistent with value @xmath38@xmath5 recently diagnosed by chen  [ 34 ] using triplet line intensity ratio of he - like n ion .",
    "table 2 shows the diagnosed electron densities of the ebit - ii plasma from different line ratios .",
    "they are obtained by comparing the theoretical line ratios with the experimental measurements which are indicated by the filled diamonds in fig .",
    "@xmath40    given the uncertainties in the theoretical and measured line ratios , the derived values of log  @xmath1 would be expected to be accurate within @xmath41  dex .",
    "the results corresponding to log@xmath3(k)=6.5 shown in table 2 , indicate that the discrepancies of diagnosed electron density from @xmath42 and @xmath7 do not exceed @xmath43  dex .",
    "the consistency of the diagnosed electron density from @xmath42 and @xmath7 further confirms that our results are reliable .",
    "@xmath6 predicts a relative higher electron density compared to @xmath2 and @xmath7 at log@xmath3(k)=6.5 .",
    "part of the reason may be due to the temperature sensitivity of @xmath6 as shown in fig",
    "a change in @xmath3 of 0.2dex leads to 10% variation in @xmath6 at @xmath37@xmath5 , which can explain the relative higher diagnosed electron density from it .",
    "the measured value of @xmath44 ( 6.33 ) exceeds the high density - sensitive limit , so no electron density can be derived as shown by fig .",
    "2 . the line at 31.360   is strongly shadowed by ar xii line at 31.374    [ 22 ] , therefore no reliable measured line intensity is available , which results in large uncertainty in @xmath33 . the line at 32.014   blends with weak lines of ar xiii at this wavelength , so a higher electron density is derived from @xmath45 .",
    "6 shows that the ratio @xmath6 is slightly sensitive to the electron temperature .",
    "at a lower electron temperature log@xmath3(k)=6.3 , the derived electron density from @xmath6 can be consistent with that from @xmath2 and @xmath7 within a much smaller uncertainty range ( 25% ) .",
    "decreasing temperature from log@xmath3(k)=6.5 to 6.3 , the uncertainty range decreases from 78% to 25% as shown in table 2 . which indicates that the electron temperature of the laboratory plasma is lower than that of maximum ar xiv fractional abundance in ionization equilibrium .",
    "table 3 lists the experimental and theoretical intensity ratios at log@xmath3(k)=6.5 and @xmath39@xmath5 . for ratios",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath45 , poor consistencies between the measurements and theoretical calculations can be found in table 3 .",
    "the temperature - sensitivity can explain the discrepancy for @xmath6 , while the contribution from those weakly ar xiii lines around 32.014   line can explain the deviation for @xmath45 .",
    "the large discrepancy for @xmath44 may be due to that the 30.344   line is strongly contaminated by ar xiii lines located at this wavelength region  [ 22 ] .",
    "we found that intensity ratios @xmath2@xmath45 of emission lines arising from @xmath12 transitions of ar xiv are sensitive to electron density . and",
    "the ratio @xmath2 is insensitive to electron temperature .",
    "for example , a change in @xmath1 of 1  dex leads to variation with factor @xmath474.4 in @xmath2 , while a change in @xmath3 of 0.2  dex ( i.e. 58% ) leads to a less than 1% variation at @xmath36 @xmath5 , up to 3% at @xmath37 @xmath5 .",
    "therefore @xmath2 is very useful for the electron density diagnostics of laboratory and astrophysical plasmas .",
    "the two lines of ar xiv relevant to @xmath2 are the strongest , and no blended ar lines have been detected in the experiment conducted by lepson  [ 22 ] in ebit - ii . by comparison between the experimental value and theoretical line intensity ratio @xmath2 , an electron density of @xmath39@xmath5 of the laboratory plasma",
    "is derived , which is consistent with value @xmath38@xmath5 recently diagnosed by chen  [ 34 ] using triplet line of n vi .",
    "the derived electron densities from @xmath6 and @xmath7 , are also consistent with that within uncertainty , which further confirms that our results are reliable . in addition , the electron density derived from these ratios eliminates the uncertainty from ionization balance and electron abundance determination . at a lower logarithmic electron temperature ( log@xmath3(k)=6.3 ) , the derived electron density from @xmath6 can be consistent with that from @xmath2 and @xmath7 within a much smaller uncertainty range ( 25% ) . which indicates the temperature of the laboratory plasma is lower than log@xmath3(k)=6.5 .",
