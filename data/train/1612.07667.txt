    "<S> @xcite these ions do not order with temperature , making the compositional disorder quenched . </S>",
    "<S> unlike the widely studied random fields ( rfs ) in magnets which linearly couple to an order parameter of the ising or heisenberg type@xcite , the quenched electric rfs of relaxors couple to a cubic order parameter  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is believed that @xmath7 is the onset temperature of a rf state in which relaxors exist  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the symmetry of the order parameter , we make the observation that the characteristic dipolar interaction of fes is equally important . </S>",
    "<S> it is well - known that the structural instability that leads to the breaking of lattice inversion symmetry and a spontaneous polarization , is the result of dipolar forces between electric dipole moments induced by the displacements of the ions associated with a zone - center transverse optic ( to ) mode  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such dipolar forces are highly anisotropic and long - ranged , which are very much in contrast with the isotropic and short - ranged exchange couplings between the spin degrees of freedom of magnets . according to the theory of phase transitions  @xcite , fes and magnets are therefore in different universality classes , rendering the standard models that describe the effects of rfs on magnetic transitions  @xcite inadequate for relaxors  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this work is then to study the random electric field problem posed by cubic relaxors within a minimal microscopic model . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that as a result of the combined effect of dipolar forces and quenched rfs a state with no - long range fe order and anisotropic , long - ranged fluctuations of polarization emerges for any amount of compositional disorder . </S>",
    "<S> we identify this disordered state as the rf state of relaxors . </S>",
    "<S> we will also show that long - ranged fe order can be induced by application of strong enough electric fields and that such transition ends at a critical point , as it is observed in experiments.@xcite    we consider a cubic lattice and choose normal mode coordinates that describe local displacements @xmath10 in the unit cell @xmath11 that are associated with the soft to mode , the condensation of which leads to the fe transition  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the model hamiltonian , @xmath12 with @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath14 is the conjugate momentum of @xmath15 ; @xmath16 is an applied electric field ; and @xmath17 is the dipolar interaction tensor with fourier transform @xmath18 \\delta _ { \\lambda \\lambda^\\prime } - 3 a_3 \\frac { q _ { \\lambda } q _ { \\lambda^\\prime } } { |{\\bm q}|^2 } ,    $ ] where @xmath19 is the magnitude of the wavevector @xmath20 ; and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are constants that depend on the lattice structure  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hereafter , we denote @xmath23 as the component of @xmath24 when @xmath25 in the direction transverse to @xmath26 ( the value of @xmath27 depends on the direction in which @xmath20 approaches zero ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath28 is the lattice stiffness and @xmath29 are anharmonic coefficients .    for the quenched random fields @xmath30 </S>",
    "<S> , we choose a gaussian probability distribution of independent random variables with zero mean and variance @xmath31 . in the absence of compositional disorder , this is a standard minimal model for ferroelectricity in cubic perovskites .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    to study the statistical mechanics of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) , it is necessary to consider thermal and quantum fluctuations at least at the level of the onsager approximation and random field fluctuations at least at the level of a replica theory .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite to do so , we generalize a variational method previously developed by one of us  @xcite to cubic symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> such method allow us to calculate the temperature and disorder dependence of relevant quantities such as the phonon frequencies , the polarization order parameter and the correlation functions in a self - consistent fashion . </S>",
    "<S> the details are presented in the methods section and supplementary material ( sm ) .    </S>",
    "<S> our model parameters are @xmath32 and @xmath33 . throughout this work , </S>",
    "<S> we have fixed the values of @xmath34 to those of typical values of oxide perovskites  @xcite and to fit the transition temperature of the conventional fe pbtio@xmath2 ( pto , @xmath35k )  @xcite assuming @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting values are given in the sm . </S>",
    "<S> our choice gives a curie - weiss constant of @xmath37k and a zone - center to phonon energy of @xmath38mev at zero temperature , which are typical of conventional fes . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the choice of the anharmonic coefficients , the low temperature fe phase predicted by the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) in the absence of compositional disorder has tetragonal ( @xmath39 ) or rhombohedral ( @xmath40 ) symmetry  @xcite . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we have chosen @xmath41 , as we will study the field - induced fe transition of relaxors , which is typically a cubic - to - rhombohedral structural phase change .  </S>"
