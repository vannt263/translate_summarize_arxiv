    "in recent years considerable effort has been dedicated to determining when the morphological characteristics of galaxies were set in place . in the case of spiral galaxies",
    "a major issue is the relative timescale of bulge and disk formation ( e.g. bouwens , cayon , & silk 1999 ) .",
    "one class of model argues that bulges form early - on , prior to the creation of stable disks , as the result of mergers or a monolithic collapse .",
    "indeed , cosmological models that assume a cold dark matter ( cdm ) dominated universe predict that large galaxies formed through the accretion of small gas - rich proto - galactic fragments . these fragments were likely short - lived , as they were consumed in major mergers that altered morphologies through kinematic heating and spurred large - scale episodes of star formation ( e.g. somerville , primack , & faber 2001 ) . given the chaotic state of the early universe , and the difficulty in maintaining stable disks in such environments ( e.g. weil , eke , & efstathiou 1998 ) , it might be anticipated that bulges were the first long - lived structures to form in the systems that would eventually become spiral galaxies .",
    "this is consistent with the relative colors of bulges and disks in the hubble deep field ( abraham et al .",
    "1999 ) , and with the age of the galactic bulge ( e.g. feltzing & gilmore 2000 , ortolani et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "at the other extreme are models in which disks formed first , and bulges are the result of secular processes involving disk material .",
    "the motion of gas in the disk can lead to the formation of spheroidal structures , and bars , which may form when gas is channeled towards the central regions of a galaxy , are key elements in this process .",
    "the bar transports angular momentum from the central regions of the galaxy to larger radii , and stars that formed in the bar will be scattered out of the disk to form a spheroidal structure when the bar buckles ( e.g. friedli & benz 1995 ) .",
    "stars that form in the inner regions of a galaxy in the absence of a bar may also be scattered into the surrounding bulge by interactions with molecular clouds ( kim & morris 2001 ) .",
    "consequently , the inner bulges of systems that are experiencing , or did experience , nuclear star formation might contain a diffuse population of intermediate age stars that did not form _ in situ_.    evidence that material originally in the disk contributes to the formation of bulges comes from the structural properties of the spheroids in late - type galaxies . rather than following an r@xmath10 profile that is the expected signature of violent relaxation , the central spheroids of late - type spiral galaxies follow sersic profiles with exponents that are indicative of a more leisurely formation process ( e.g. balcells et al .",
    "2003 ; courteau , de jong , & broeils 1996 ; andredakis , peletier , & balcells 1995 ) .",
    "it might also be anticipated that the stellar contents of bulges will show a morphological dependence if they are built up by secular processes , in the sense that the luminosity - weighted ages of bulges will become younger as one moves to later morphological types .",
    "nevertheless , some exponential bulges have colors that are similar to those of bulges that follow r@xmath10 light profiles ( carollo et al .",
    "2001 ) , suggesting that secular evolution may have occured early - on , but was subsequently curtailed .",
    "the development of bulges from disk material may also affect the large scale properties of disks , as the mixing caused by bars will smooth out pre - existing abundance profiles in the disk ( e.g. friedli & benz 1995 ) .",
    "the monolithic collapse and secular evolution models of bulge formation make certain predictions about the properties of bulges and their component stars .",
    "if bulges form early - on in violent collapse episodes then they will be made up of old stars .",
    "metallicity gradients that are the signatures of dissipation should also be present .",
    "finally , the chemical contents of stars formed in such a manner will show the signatures of rapid enrichment .",
    "on the other hand , bulges that are assembled solely from secular processes will be comprised of young or intermediate age stars .",
    "there may be an age gradient , in the sense that the youngest stars are located closest to the disk plane .",
    "the chemical compositions of stars in a bulge assembled in such a way will also show the signatures of a slow enrichment history .    as noted by bouwens et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , reality likely falls somewhere between the extremes defined by the monolithic collapse and secular evolution models .",
    "indeed , bulges almost certainly do not evolve in isolation , and there are observational indications that the evolution of bulges and disks are coupled , even long after the bulge is in place .",
    "there is a high incidence of distinct nuclear sources in the central regions of nearby bulges , which have spectrophotometric properties that differ from those of the surrounding bulge and show evidence of recent star formation ( e.g. boker et al . 1999 , 2002 ; carollo et al .",
    "reservoirs of cool gas must be present near the centers of these galaxies , and the surrounding disks are a likely source of this material .",
    "this interplay between disks and bulges has been on - going for some time , as central blue knots are seen in many disk galaxies at intermediate redshifts ( ellis , abraham , & dickinson 2001 ) .",
    "the observational challenges inherent to studies of very distant systems can make it difficult to use them to distinguish between the various processes that affect bulge evolution ( e.g. bouwens et al . 1999 ) .",
    "however , the interplay between disks and bulges will have observational consequences in nearby spiral galaxies , and so these systems are key laboratories for testing models of bulge evolution",
    ". studies of the resolved stellar contents in the bulges of nearby galaxies can be used to search for the young and intermediate age stars that are the expected signatures of secular processes . moreover ,",
    "if stars on the rgb are resolved then it may be possible to search for the abundance gradients that are the expected signatures of a dissipational collapse .    as the closest external spiral galaxy",
    ", m31 is an obvious target for detailed study .",
    "there are hints that , like many other nearby systems , the central regions of m31 may have experienced star formation in the not too distant past .",
    "the colors of the nucleus differ from those of the surrounding bulge ( king , stanford , & crane 1995 ; davidge et al . 1997 ; brown et al . 1998 ; lauer et al . 1998 ) , suggesting a distinct stellar content , such as might remain after the termination of star formation during the last few gyr .",
    "there are also spectroscopic signatures of a central young and/or intermediate age population ( e.g. bica , alloin , & schmidt 1990 ; davidge 1997 ; silchenko , burenkov , & vlasyuk 1998 ) , although a population of resolved intermediate - aged stars has yet to be detected in the inner regions of m31 .",
    "in fact , the brightest red stars are well - mixed throughout the inner bulge , and so likely formed with the main body of the bulge ( davidge 2001 ) . in addition , the brightnesses and densities of luminous agb stars in the bulge of m31 are similar to those in systems that are as disparate as m32 and ngc 5128 , further supporting the notion that they come from an old population ( davidge 2002 ) .",
    "the red giant branch of the m31 bulge has a color that is consistent with a near - solar metallicity ( jablonka et al .",
    "1999 ; stephens et al . 2001 ) , although the rgb - tip may be depressed with respect to larger galactocentric distances ( jablonka et al .",
    "this latter result is counter to what would be expected if metallicity decreases with increasing galactocentric distance , but could be indicative of an age gradient .",
    "additional hints into the star forming history of the central regions of m31 come from studies of stars in the disk of the galaxy .",
    "morrison et al . ( 2004 ) find a population of globular clusters in m31 that have disk kinematics and span a range of metallicities , suggesting that a stable disk was in place at very early epochs , so that secular interactions between the disk and bulge may have started early - on .",
    "young and intermediate age stars are seen at moderate to large galactocentric distances ( e.g. richer , crabtree , & pritchet 1990 ; davidge 1993 ; brewer , richer , & crabtree 1995 ; cuillandre et al .",
    "2001 ; sarajedini & van duyne 2001 ; ferguson & johnson 2001 ) , and there was large scale star formation throughout much of the disk up to 1 gyr in the past ( williams 2002 ) .",
    "however , star formation at present appears to be restricted to the spiral arms , where the star formation rate has not changed during the past gyr ( williams 2002 ) .",
    "the metallicity distribution is remarkably similar over a large range of galactocentric distances , peaking near [ fe / h ] @xmath11 , with only a very modest number of stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath12 , even in fields that sample the halo ( e.g. bellazzini et al .",
    "finally , there have been interactions between m31 and its companions ( e.g. saito & iye 2000 ; choi , guhathakurta , & johnston 2002 ; ferguson et al .",
    "2002 ) , which have probably influenced the star - forming history of m31 , and may have triggered flows of gas into the central regions of the galaxy .    are there spatially resolved young or intermediate age stars in the innermost regions of m31 ?",
    "do studies of the photometric properties of resolved rgb stars reveal signs of a metallicity gradient in the inner spheroid , as predicted if the bulge experienced a dissipational collapse ?",
    "in the present study , deep @xmath0 and @xmath1 images obtained with the altair adaptive optics ( ao ) system @xmath13 niri imager on gemini north ( gn ) are used to probe the age and metallicity distributions in four m31 fields .",
    "the near - infrared is an important wavelength region for studies of this nature .",
    "the photometric properties of very red stars at visible wavelengths are affected by line blanketing , with the result that the upper rgb of stars with near - solar metallicities slumps over on visible wavelength cmds .",
    "this makes it difficult to detect the most metal - rich upper rgb stars , and so the mean metallicity of the rgb may be underestimated .",
    "line blanketing also causes the agb to be a near horizontal sequence on cmds constructed from data with observations shortward of @xmath14 m ( e.g. figure 5 of richer et al .",
    "1990 ) . however , the agb forms a sequence that is closer to vertical on near - infrared cmds ( e.g. davidge 2000a ) , thereby making it easier to resolve agb stars in crowded fields and identify the agb - tip .",
    "there is also a well - calibrated relation between the slope of the rgb and metallicity in the near - infrared ( e.g. ferraro et al . 2000 ; kuchinski et al . 1995 ) . finally , interstellar extinction is less of a concern in the infrared , reducing complications caused by the non - uniform distribution of dust throughout the m31 disk ( e.g. cuillandre et al .",
    "2001 ; williams 2002 ) .    the fields that were observed sample a range of stellar densities , from the outer disk , where the incidence of crowding is negligible , to a distance of only two arcmin from the galaxy center , where crowding is a significant concern ( e.g. davidge 2001 ; stephens et al .",
    "three of the fields are dominated by bulge stars , while the fourth is dominated by disk stars . with an angular resolution of 0.08 arcsec fwhm in @xmath1 , which corresponds roughly to 0.3 parsecs at the distance of m31 , these are the highest angular resolution near - infrared images yet obtained of this galaxy .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "details of the observations , the data reduction procedures , and the photometric measurements are discussed in  2 . in  3 and 4",
    "the photometric properties of stars in the disk and bulge fields are discussed , while in  5 the issue of crowding is addressed .",
    "a summary and discussion of the results follows in  6 .",
    "the data were recorded during the night of november 18/19 ( ut ) 2003 with the altair adaptive optics ( ao ) system and niri imager on gemini north ( gn ) .",
    "altair is a natural guide star ao system , the key elements of which are a 177 element deformable mirror ( dm ) , conjugated to an altitude of 6.5 km above the mauna kea summit , and a @xmath15 shack - hartmann wave front sensor ( wfs ) .",
    "herriot et al . ( 2000 ) give a complete description of altair .",
    "niri is the facility infrared imager on gn , and this instrument is described in detail by hodapp et al .",
    "the f/32 camera was used for these observations , and so each pixel on the @xmath16 insb detector subtends 0.022 arcsec on a side , while the total imaged field is @xmath17 arcsec .",
    "the target fields were selected based on the availability of a guide star with @xmath18 , which is the brightness that will allow altair to provide the maximum correction during typical observing conditions .",
    "four fields in m31 that sample regions with very different stellar densities were observed through @xmath0 and @xmath1 filters .",
    "table 1 lists ( 1 ) the field names used throughout this study , ( 2 ) the co - ordinates and guide star catalogue identification numbers of the guide stars , ( 3 ) the angular distance from the center of m31 , ( 4 ) @xmath7band disk and bulge surface brightnesses for each field based on the kent ( 1989 ) small bulge model , and ( 5 ) the exposure times for each field .",
    "walterbos & kennicutt ( 1998 ) compute an effective radius of 2.0 kpc for the m31 bulge , which corresponds to 9 arcmin , and 2 of the 4 fields fall within this radius .",
    "the guide star for bulge 1 is not in the guide star catalogue because of its close proximity to the center of the galaxy .",
    "a four point square dither pattern , that was 4 arcsec on a side , was employed in @xmath19 and @xmath20 , while a 5 point dither pattern , which was the same pattern used in @xmath19 and @xmath20 but with an extra point in the middle , was used in @xmath1 . the uncorrected image quality while these data were recorded , calculated from data supplied by the altair wfs , ranged between 0.45 and 0.80 arcsec fwhm at visible wavelengths .",
    "the corrected image quality at a few arcsec distance from the ao reference star is typically 0.08 arcsec fwhm in @xmath1 , and 0.10 arcsec fwhm in @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the data were reduced using a standard pipeline for infrared observations .",
    "the initial steps in the reduction sequence were : ( 1 ) the subtraction of a dark frame , ( 2 ) the division by a flat - field frame , ( 3 ) the removal of the dc sky level on a frame - by - frame basis , and ( 4 ) the removal of interference fringes and the thermal signatures of warm objects along the optical path .",
    "the calibration frame used in the last step was constructed by median - combining sky - subtracted images of all m31 fields .",
    "the processed images were registered to correct for dither offsets and then median - combined to suppress bad pixels and cosmic rays .",
    "a small number of exposures in which the image quality was noticeably poorer than average were not included when creating the combined images .",
    "finally , the combined images of each field were trimmed to the area of common exposure time , which is typically @xmath21 arcsec .",
    "the final @xmath22band images of the disk 1 and bulge 1 fields , which have the lowest and highest stellar densities in the current sample , are shown in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "stellar brightnesses were measured with the point spread function ( psf ) fitting program allstar ( stetson & harris 1988 ) , using psfs and stellar co - ordinates obtained with tasks in daophot ( stetson 1987 ) .",
    "a single spatially non - varying psf , typically obtained from 30  60 stars , was constructed for each field @xmath13 filter combination .",
    "anisoplanicity distorts the psf near the edge of some of our images ( e.g. mcclure et al .",
    "1991 ) , and only those portions of the datasets that were deemed to have stable psfs , as determined from a visual inspection of the sharpness and shape of the psf , were considered for photometric investigation . in @xmath19",
    "the maximum radius for psf stability was roughly 5 arcsec from the guide star , while in @xmath20 this radius was typically @xmath23 arcsec .",
    "the psf was stable over an even larger portion of the field in @xmath2 .",
    "the disk 1 data were recorded during exceptionally good conditions , and there is no sign of anisoplanicity in these data .",
    "consequently , photometry was done over the entire field .",
    "no attempt was made to do photometry within 2 arcsec of the reference star in any field , as the psf wings of this very bright object hinder the detection of faint stars .",
    "the photometric measurements used in this study were made by td .",
    "an independent set of photometric measurements was made by ko , also using daophot .",
    "the two sets of calibrated photometry agree within the uncertainties , lending confidence to the photometric measurements .",
    "the photometric calibration was set using observations of standard stars from hawarden et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and hunt et al .",
    "the standard deviation of the individual standard star measurements about the final zeropoints , obtained with a 25 pixel radius aperture to match the psf radius used for the m31 photometry , is @xmath24 mag in all three filters .",
    "aperture corrections were measured from the psf stars in each frame .",
    "the presence of faint , unresolved stars introduces uncertainties in these measurements , that will depend on the stellar density of the field in question .",
    "we estimate that the aperture corrections in disk 1 , disk 2 , and bulge 2 have uncertainties of a few hundredths of a mag , while in bulge 1 the aperture correction may have an uncertainty of @xmath24 mag .",
    "the photometric calibration was checked using the published 2mass brightnesses of the ao guide stars in bulge 1 , bulge 2 , and disk 2 ; this was not possible for disk 1 as the ao guide star was not detected by 2mass .",
    "the central cores of the guide stars are saturated in the images , and so the total brightness was estimated from the wings of the psf . for bulge 1 and 2",
    "the estimated brightness of the guide star agrees with that measured by 2mass to within a few hundredths of a magnitude .",
    "however , for disk 2 , which has the brightest , and hence most heavily saturated ao reference star , there is a 0.25 mag difference in @xmath2 between the brightness measured from the altair data and that measured by 2mass , in the sense that the altair brightness is the fainter of the two . given that ( 1 ) the bright stellar contents in these fields scale well with surface brightness (  5 ) , and ( 2 ) the altair and 2mass brightnesses of the guide stars in bulge 1 and 2 are in good agreement , we suspect that the ao guide star for disk 2 is a photometric variable .",
    "artificial star experiments were run to determine sample completeness , estimate the uncertainties introduced by photon statistics and crowding , and assess systematic effects in the photometry .",
    "the artificial stars were created using the psfs constructed for the photometric analysis , and so these experiments do not include the effects of anisoplanicity .",
    "the artificial stars were distributed randomly throughout the frames , avoiding the high surface brightness region immediately surrounding the ao guide stars .",
    "the stars were assigned colors ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) and brightnesses ( @xmath2 between 16 and 21 ) appropriate for agb and rgb stars in m31 , and were distributed in brightness according to a power - law luminosity function ( lf ) with exponent 0.2 . between 200 and 240 stars were added to each frame over two runs , with a minimum of 10 stars per brightness bin .",
    "this number of stars per run was selected to prevent artificially increasing the level of crowding at the faint end in each simulation . while the number of artificial stars used in this study is modest , it is still sufficient to assess the extent of blending and determine the brightness at which sample incompleteness becomes significant in each dataset ( see below ) .",
    "the completeness fractions of stars detected in both @xmath20 and @xmath2 , @xmath27 , the mean difference between the actual and measured @xmath2 brightnesses , @xmath28k , and the standard deviation about @xmath28k , @xmath29 , are shown in figure 3 .",
    "the difference between the actual and measured brightnesses for all of the recovered artificial stars in the two most crowded fields , bulge 1 and 2 , is shown as a function of @xmath2 in figure 4 .",
    "as @xmath27 drops @xmath28k and @xmath29 increase , and the the magnitude at which sample incompleteness reaches 50% is correlated with field surface brightness , which measures the degree of crowding .",
    "@xmath28k is of particular interest as it monitors systematic effects in the photometry . in low density environments , systematic errors in stellar brightnesses",
    "will become significant only when statistical errors imposed by the night sky level and integration time become large , as faint sources that coincide with positive peaks in the sky noise spectrum will preferentially be detected .",
    "the situation is different for very crowded environments , where systematic errors due to crowding , including blending , may occur well above the limit imposed by photon statistics .",
    "it should be noted that in crowded fields the systematic effects on colors , especially those spanning small to intermediate wavelength intervals , will likely be smaller than in single filter measurements , as the photometry in both filters will be affected by crowding by roughly the same amount .    in both disk fields and bulge 2 @xmath28k and @xmath29",
    "only depart significantly from the values defined at the bright end when @xmath30 , although it is evident from figure 4 that a modest fraction of objects in bulge 2 with @xmath31 may be blends of fainter objects .",
    "that @xmath28k and @xmath29 in these fields are near 0 over much of the brightness range explored by the artificial star experiments suggests that crowding and blending is not a factor in these fields . however , the situation is different in bulge 1 , which is the most crowded field . in this field",
    "@xmath28k @xmath32 magnitude when @xmath33 , while @xmath29 grows quickly when @xmath34 .",
    "a modest fraction of objects in bulge 1 at the bright end are likely blends .",
    "indeed , of the 45 artificial stars with @xmath35 , 3 were recovered with brightnesses that exceed the actual values by at least 0.5 magnitudes , indicating that they were blended with stars of similar brightness .",
    "the frequency of such blends is thus @xmath36 , where the quoted errors are @xmath37 uncertainties .",
    "disk 1 differs from the other fields observed with altair in that ( 1 ) the stellar density is low , so that crowding is not an issue , and ( 2 ) the stellar content is dominated by disk stars .",
    "the @xmath5 and @xmath38 cmds of stars in disk 1 are plotted in the left hand panels of figures 5 and 6 .",
    "the number of stars plotted in each cmd is stated in each panel .",
    "given the modest number of bright giants detected in this field then only limited conclusions can be drawn from these data .",
    "the rgb in disk 1 is wider than what is expected soley from the photometric errors predicted from the artificial star experiments .",
    "this is demonstrated in table 2 , where the standard deviation in @xmath39 and @xmath40 for stars with @xmath2 between 17.5 and 18.5 , which corresponds roughly to the top 1 magnitude of the rgb , listed in columns 2 and 4 , are compared with the dispersion predicted from the artificial star experiments , which are listed in columns 3 and 5 .",
    "an f - test indicates the observed and predicted dispersions differ well in excess of the @xmath41 significance level .",
    "a number of factors likely contribute to the broadening of the rgb , including anisoplanicity , differential reddening , and the dispersion in mean metallicity that is seen throughout the disk and halo of m31 ( bellazzini et al .",
    "the latter may dominate .",
    "in fact , the metallicity distribution functions ( mdf ) constructed by bellazzini et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have an approximate standard deviation of @xmath6 dex in [ fe / h ] , and this will introduce a dispersion of @xmath24 mag in @xmath40 near the rgb - tip ( ferraro et al .",
    "the result of subtracting in quadrature the scatter due to photometric errors from the observed dispersion in @xmath40 is shown in the last column of table 2 .",
    "this ` residual ' scatter is close to that predicted from a @xmath6 dex dispersion in metallicity .",
    "while the @xmath38 cmd goes considerably deeper than the @xmath5 cmd , @xmath40 is much more sensitive to metallicity than @xmath39 , and so the @xmath42 cmd is used to investigate the metallicity of stars in this study .",
    "the left hand panel of figure 7 shows the @xmath43 cmd of disk 1 , assuming a distance modulus of 24.4 ( van den bergh 2000 ) , and e(b  v ) = 0.1 due to foreground material ( burstein & heiles 1984 ) .",
    "these values are used throughout the paper .",
    "the reddening law from rieke & lebofsky ( 1985 ) was adopted to compute a@xmath44 and e(j  k ) .",
    "also shown on figure 7 are the rgb loci of the globular clusters 47 tuc ( [ fe / h ] = 0.8 ) and ngc 6528 ( [ fe / h ] = 0.0 ) , based on the rgb colors listed in table 2 of ferraro et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ; the cluster metallicities are taken from the harris ( 1996 ) database .",
    "inspection of figure 7 suggests that disk 1 is dominated by relatively metal - rich stars , with a mean [ fe / h ] close to that of ngc 6528 .",
    "the mdf is evidently skewed to high values , as no stars significantly more metal - poor than 47 tuc have been detected , although with only a modest number of stars in the cmd then even a population of giants that are more metal - poor than 47 tuc and account for @xmath45 10% of the total number of stars may be missed due to small number statistics . nevertheless , the relatively high mean metallicity of the disk 1 field is a robust result , that is consistent with other studies of the outer regions of m31 ( e.g. bellazzini et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the @xmath2 lf of disk 1 , based on stars that are detected in both @xmath20 and @xmath2 , is shown in figure 8 .",
    "whereas a 0.25 mag binning interval is used to construct the lfs of the fields closer to the center of m31 , the low density of stars in disk 1 necessitates the use of a coarser binning interval . despite the large error bars in the individual bins , it is evident that the disk 1 lf roughly follows a power - law .",
    "davidge ( 2000b ) used the cfht ao system to investigate the stellar content in the metal - rich globular cluster ngc 6528 , which has a metallicity and age that is comparable to that of stars in baade s window ( e.g. momany et al .",
    "a least squares fit of a power - law to the ngc 6528 lf shown in figure 3 of davidge ( 2000b ) , neglecting the bins containing the hb and rgb - bump , gives an exponent @xmath46 .",
    "for comparison , davidge ( 2001 ) found that the @xmath2 lfs of metal - poor globular clusters tend to have @xmath47 , although there is considerable scatter , with some clusters having exponents similar to that measured in ngc 6528 .",
    "given that the rgb in disk 1 has a color consistent with ngc 6528 , a power - law with @xmath46 was fit to the lf entries with @xmath2 between 18 and 21 , and the result is plotted in figure 8 .",
    "the @xmath46 power - law provides a reasonable fit to the data , although there is considerable scatter due to small number statistics .",
    "we have not attempted to measure the brightness of the rgb - tip in disk 1 because of the modest number of stars .",
    "however , it is evident from figure 7 that the vast majority of the stars in disk 1 have m@xmath48 , and hence are on the rgb ( ferraro et al .",
    "there is only one star significantly brighter than the rgb - tip in disk 1 , and this object is likely evolving on the agb .",
    "an intermediate age population might be expected in disk 1 given the detection of intermediate age stars in the halo ( brown et al .",
    "2003 ) and outermost disk ( ferguson & johnson 2001 ) of m31 .",
    "unfortunately , the agb content of disk 1 provides only loose limits on age because of the tiny area sampled by altair@xmath13niri coupled with the low surface density of stars .",
    "the single bright agb star has m@xmath49 .",
    "models predict that the agb - tip should occur near m@xmath49 in solar metallicity systems with ages in excess of @xmath50 gyr ( girardi et al .",
    "2002 ) , and this is consistent with the intrinsic @xmath22band brightnesses of long period variables ( lpvs ) in metal - rich globular clusters ( e.g. frogel 1983 ) .",
    "therefore , based solely on the single bright agb star detected here , there is no evidence for a population younger than a few gyr , although this conclusion may change when a larger area is surveyed .",
    "the @xmath38 and @xmath5 cmds of disk 2 are shown in the right hand panels of figures 5 and 6 , while the @xmath43 cmd is shown in the right hand panel of figure 7 .",
    "the standard deviations of the colors of stars with @xmath2 between 17.5 and 18.5 are listed in table 2 . as in disk 1 ,",
    "the disk 2 rgb is wider than expected from photometric errors alone .",
    "the scatter that remains after removing the contribution from photometric errors is broader than in disk 1 .",

    "the surface brightnesses of f1 and f174 differ by almost 1 magnitude per arcsec@xmath87 , and the excellent agreement between the lfs of these fields in figure 16 suggests strongely that blending is not a major factor at the bright end of the nicmos data .",
    "the bulge 2 lf is in good agreement with the nicmos measurements over most of the brightness range considered .",
    "while the bulge 1 data consistently falls some 0.3  0.4 dex above the lfs of the nicmos fields , this is likely not a consequence of crowding .",

    "( 2003 ) .    in  3 and 4 it was demonstrated that the rgbs of disk 1 and bulge 1 have @xmath40 colors that are consistent with the rgb of the metal - rich globular cluster ngc 6528 , while the rgbs of disk 2 and bulge 2 have @xmath40 colors that are redder than the ngc 6528 sequence . before discussing this result further",
    ", it should be noted that other colors give similar results .",
    "in particular , we have compared the @xmath90 cmds of the four fields observed with altair with fiducial globular cluster sequences from table 6 of valenti , ferraro , & origlia ( 2004 ) .",
    "the rgbs of disk 1 and bulge 1 on the @xmath90 cmds agree well with the rgb of the metal - rich globular cluster ngc 6440 , which has a metallicity that is only slightly lower than that of ngc 6528 , while the rgbs of disk 2 and bulge 2 are significantly redder .",
    "the mean metallicities of the four fields observed with altair , as inferred from the color of the rgb , are likely reliable to no more than a few tenths of a dex .",
    "the uncertainty in the photometric calibration is @xmath91 magnitude , which introduces uncertainties of @xmath92 dex in [ fe / h ] .",
    "an even greater source of potential error is the patchy dust absorption that occurs throughout the central regions of m31 . in ",
    "4.2 it was argued that this introduces uncertainties of @xmath59 magnitudes in the intrinsic rgb colors , with the result that the mean metallicity in each field can not be estimated to better than a few tenths of a dex .    while the color of the rgb can be affected by uncertainties in the photometric calibration and the mean line - of - sight extinction ,",
    "this is not the case for the scatter at a given brightness within a particular field . after accounting for the dispersion caused by photometric errors , as predicted by artificial star experiments ,",
    "the widths of the upper rgbs of all four fields on the @xmath5 cmds are consistent with a metallicity dispersion with a standard deviation @xmath6 dex in [ fe / h ] .",

    "5.2 it was demonstrated that the @xmath22band lfs of the 4 altair fields scale with @xmath7band surface brightness . in old solar metallicity populations the integrated @xmath7band light is dominated by main sequence stars ( e.g. buzzoni 1989 ) . for comparison ,",
    "the @xmath22band lfs constructed from the altair data are dominated by stars on the upper rgb and agb .",
    "the comparisons in figure 15 thus show that the ratio of agb @xmath13 rgb stars to main sequence stars , which is a quantity that is sensitive to age , appears not to change over a range of disk - to - bulge ratios .    in the following sub - sections",
    "the results obtained from the altair data are discussed in the context of other observations . given that disks and bulges are structurally distinct entities , the stellar contents of the disk and bulge of m31 are discussed separately .",
    "however , the reader is reminded that there are mechanisms that may couple the stellar contents of disks and bulges ( e.g. kim & morris 2001 ) .",
    "that the metallicities of rgb stars in disk 1 and 2 differ by no more than a few tenths of a dex suggests that the metallicity gradient among rgb stars in the disk of m31 must be modest in size , and this conclusion is consistent with some , but not all , studies of the chemical content in m31 .",
    "for example , trundle et al .",
    "( 2002 ) find that the chemical contents of bright supergiants do not show radial variations in m31 , while bellazzini et al .",
    "( 2003 ) find that the abundance distributions of rgb stars in a number of fields are similar .",
    "in contrast , blair , kirshner , & chevalier ( 1982 ) find radial gradients in the abundances of nitrogen and oxygen in m31 hii regions , which are consistent with radial variations in the c to m giant ratio when r@xmath93 kpc if these are interpreted as a metallicity effect ( brewer , richer , & crabtree 1995 ) .",
    "radial variations in mean age and metallicity are common in spiral galaxies ( e.g. bell & de jong 2000 ) , and gradients of this nature were likely imprinted during disk formation . however ,",
    "as noted in the previous paragraph , there are some indications that mixing may have been highly effective throughout a large portion of the m31 disk , at least among stars with ages comparable to objects on the rgb .",
    "what processes could have smoothed population gradients in the disk of m31 ?",
    "radial flows of gas and stars in disks can be induced by a number of processes , including spiral density waves ( e.g. casuso & berkman 2001 ; sellwood & binney 2002 ) , viscosity ( silk 2001 ; ferguson & clarke 2001 ) , galaxy - galaxy interactions ( barnes & hernquist 1992 ; mihos & hernquist 1996 ) , dynamical friction ( noguchi 1999 ; 2000 ) and the infall of angular momentum - rich gas from the halo ( ferguson & clarke 2001 ) .",
    "the outward movement of gas clouds may drive the age distribution near the disk edge to younger values ( ferguson & clarke 2001 ) .",
    "in fact , intermediate age populations at large galactocentric distances , possibly related to the disk , are seen in the sc galaxies ngc 2403 and m33 ( davidge 2003a ) , as well as in the outer regions of the m31 disk ( ferguson & johnson 2001 ) .    of the various mechanisms that might cause mixing , tidal interactions between m31 and its companions are potentially attractive given the evidence that m31 and its satellites have interacted .",
    "for example , there is a warp in the hi disk ( e.g. sawa & sofue 1982 ) , while the star forming history of ngc 205 appears to be coupled with its orbit about m31 ( davidge 2003b ) . perhaps most significantly , there are well - defined tidal tails extending from some m31 companions ( e.g. ferguson et al .",
    "however , tidal interactions should also cause mixing of gas , and so this process does not explain the abundance gradients found by blair et al .",
    "( 1982 ) . clearly , it will be of interest to determine if rgb stars in other disk systems , such as m81 , show evidence for an abundance gradient , or are as well mixed as in m31 .",
    "the bulge of m31 likely contains a radial metallicity gradient .",
    "davidge ( 1997 ) estimated that @xmath28[fe / h]/@xmath28log(r ) @xmath94 from a grid of long slit spectra that mapped the central 1 arcmin of m31 .",
    "this is shallower than what is seen in the outer regions of the bulge of the milky - way ( minniti et al .",
    "1995 ; tiede , frogel , & terndrup 1995 ) , although ramirez et al .",
    "( 2000 ) find that the metallicity gradient in the galactic bulge may flatten in the central few hundred parsecs .",
    "if the gradient measured by davidge ( 1997 ) is assumed to extend to larger radii then the mean metallicities of bulge 1 and 2 will differ by 0.15 dex .",
    "this is likely a lower limit as the abundance gradient outside of the inner regions of the m31 bulge may steepen , as is the case in the milky - way ( ramirez et al .",
    "the bulge 1 and 2 data may contain signs of a metallicity gradient in the m31 bulge . in ",
    "4.2 it was demonstrated that the rgb - tip in bulge 1 appears to the brighter than that in bulge 2 .",
    "while the artificial star experiments indicate that some of the stars in bulge 1 near the rgb - tip are likely blends , the number of such objects will account for only @xmath95 of the total at this brightness (  2.4 ) , and this is clearly not enough to explain the difference in the rgb - tips in figure 13 .",
    "we further note that the difference in rgb - tip brightness is also not a consequence of small number statistics , as numerical simulations indicate that only 45 stars are needed on the upper 2.5 mag of the rgb to measure the rgb - tip brightness to within @xmath24 mag ( crocker & rood 1984 ) , and the upper rgbs of bulge 1 and 2 contain far more stars than this .",
    "a metal - rich population in bulge 1 that is not seen in bulge 2 could explain the difference in rgb - tip brightnesses , as the brightness of the rgb - tip in @xmath2 depends on metallicity , in the sense of becoming brighter and redder with increasing metallicity .",
    "the calibration between the @xmath22band brightness and metallicity among globular clusters derived by ferraro et al .",

    "it should be emphasized that the rgb colors of bulge 1 and 2 are not consistent with this interpretation , although this could be a consequence of reddening internal to m31 ( e.g.  4.2 ) .",
    "clearly , spectroscopic observations of individual stars will be the most secure means of measuring metallicities , and integral field spectrographs coupled to adaptive optics systems , such as altair @xmath13 nifs on gemini north , will be required to overcome crowding in the high stellar density fields near the center of m31 .

    "third , efforts to measure the peak brightness of the agb are complicated by stellar variability .",
    "if the brightest agb stars in the bulge of m31 are lpvs like those in the galactic bulge then they will have amplitudes of up to @xmath96 mag in @xmath2 ( glass et al .",
    "in fact , it is likely that the brightest stars imaged in the bulge of m31 at any given time are lpvs near the peak of their light curves , and this can be confirmed with multi - epoch observations , as has been done for m32 by davidge & rigaut ( 2004 ) .",
    "the brightest agb stars in bulge 1 and 2 have m@xmath97 , and m@xmath51 , and hence are not different from what is seen in the galactic bulge ( frogel & whitford 1987 ) .",
    "if these stars are lpvs near the peak of their light curves then they will have a mean brightness m@xmath98 .",
    "this is consistent with the expected agb peak brightness in an old solar - metallicity system ( girardi et al .",
    "the peak agb brightness in the m31 bulge is also comparable to that of the brightest agb star in the metal - rich globular cluster ngc 6553 ( guarnieri , renzini , & ortolani 1997 ) , which has an old age ( e.g. ortolani et al . 1995 ) .",
    "these data thus suggest that an old population dominates in the inner regions of m31 .",
    "as noted above , peak stellar brightness does not offer an ironclad means of probing age .",
    "in fact , there are a number of sources with m@xmath99 in bulge 1 and 2 and the disk 2 field that have very red colors , and these provide additional insights into the stellar content near the center of m31 that contradicts the notion that these fields are dominated by an old stellar population . in particular , hughes & wood ( 1991 ) investigated the near - infrared photometric properties of lpvs in the lmc , and found that the vast majority of objects with @xmath100 are c stars ; of the three objects in their sample with @xmath100 that are not c stars , two are very luminous ( m@xmath101 ) and have periods in excess of 600 days .",
    "davidge ( 2003b ) used @xmath39 and @xmath40 colors to identify c stars in ngc 205 , and recovered c stars identified previously by richer , crabtree , & pritchet ( 1984 ) from narrow - band photometry .    based on the photometric study by hughes & wood ( 1991 ) ,",
    "we identify objects with @xmath100 in the altair cmds as c stars .",
    "these stars tend to have m@xmath44 between 7 and 8.5 .",
    "observations indicate that c star production does not occur in systems with ages in excess of 6 gyr , and that the maximum age for c star production drops as one moves to higher metallicities ( e.g. cole & weinberg 2002 ) .",
    "hence , the presence of c stars indicate that there is likely an intermediate age population in disk 2 and bulge 1 and 2 .",
    "the identification of the very red objects in m31 as c stars has potential implications for the bulge and inner disk of the milky - way , as a population of very red objects is also seen in the @xmath5 cmd of baade s window shown in figure 17 of frogel & whitford ( 1987 ) .",
    "the main stellar sample considered by frogel & whitford ( 1987 ) consists of m giants that were selected from grism surveys , and only two of the stars identified as m giants have @xmath100 .",
    "both of these objects have spectral types from blanco , mccarthy , & blanco ( 1984 ) , are photometrically variable , and have two @xmath40 colors listed in table 1 of frogel & whitford ( 1987 ) .",
    "star # 87 ( spectral type m8 ) has @xmath102 and 1.76 , and so may or may not meet the near - infrared color criterion for c star status depending on the epoch of observation .",
    "star # 250 ( spectral type m7 ) is clearly more interesting , as it has @xmath103 in both measurements ; however , it is also one of the faintest stars classified by blanco et al .",
    "( 1984 ) , and so presumably falls near the faint limit of their data .    the remainder of the stars with @xmath100 in the frogel & whitford sample are lpvs from the sample that was observed by glass & feast ( 1982 ) . to the best of our knowledge",
    "these objects do not have spectra , presumably because they are relatively faint at visible wavelengths .",
    "in fact , the tcd shown in figure 2 of frogel & whitford ( 1987 ) indicates that a star with @xmath104 will have @xmath105 .",
    "the lpvs in figure 17 of frogel & whitford ( 1987 ) tend to have @xmath106 between 6 and 7.5 ( i.e. m@xmath44 between 7 and 8.5 ) , and so will have @xmath107 between 16 and 17.5 . after dimming to account for extinction , these stars will have @xmath108 between 17 and 18.5 .",
    "azzopardi , lequeux , & rebeirot ( 1985 ) conducted a grens survey of baade s window , and found 15 c stars with @xmath108 between 15.5 and 17.5 .",
    "azzopardi et al .",
    "( 1985 ) argued that these stars are too faint to be c stars associated with the galactic bulge ; however , the arguements given in the previous paragraph indicate that at least some of the objects found by azzopardi et al .",
    "( 1985 ) have @xmath108 brightnesses that are consistent with them being very red c stars at the distance of the galactic bulge . to be sure",
    ", some of these objects may be dwarf c stars , which are difficult to identify using spectrophotometric information alone ( e.g. downes et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the only ironclad means to confirm the nature of the c stars indentified by azzopardi et al .",
    "( 1985 ) is to obtain proper motions for these objects , which will allow their distances to be measured .",
    "the detection of intermediate age stars in the altair data is perhaps not a surprise .",
    "spectroscopic studies suggest that there is a centrally - concentrated young or intermediate - age component in m31 ( bica et al .",
    "1990 ; davidge 1997 ; silchenko et al .",
    "the geometric center of m31 has a very red @xmath109 color ( davidge et al .",
    "1997 ) , which may be due to a population of agb stars that formed during the past gyr .",
    "studies of the innermost regions of the galactic bulge may provide clues about the nature of the central regions of m31 .",
    "contrary to expectations ( e.g. figer et al .",
    "2000 ) , star formation occurs near the center of the galaxy .",
    "there is a cluster of young stars around sgra * ( lebofsky , rieke , & tokunaga 1982 ; krabbe et al .",
    "1991 ; davidge et al . 1997 ; blum et al .",
    "2003 ) , as well as other young clusters within the central 100 pc ( e.g. cotera et al . 1996",
    "; figer et al . 1999 ) , and at even larger distances ( launhardt , zylka , & mezger 2002 ) .",
    "the structural properties of the region near the galactic center ( serabyn & morris 1996 ) , the presence of shells at large r@xmath110 that apparently originate from the inner regions of the galaxy ( bland - hawthorn & cohen 2003 ) , and the analysis of the stellar content near the galactic center ( blum et al . 2003 ) together suggest that the current star forming activity near the galactic center is not a unique event , but is likely an on - going or episodic phenomenon with a time scale shorter than a gyr .",
    "nuclei similar to sgra are also common in nearby spiral galaxies , further supporting the arguement that nuclear star formation is episodic ( e.g. davidge & courteau 2002 ) .",
    "the timescale for the disruption of star clusters near the galactic center is short ( e.g. figer at al .",
    "1999 ) , and individual stars may be scattered out of the disk plane by interactions with giant molecular clouds ( kim & morris 2001 ) . consequently , the stars that form along the plane of the disk in the inner regions of a spiral galaxy can diffuse away from their natal locations , and be injected into the surrounding bulge .",
    "processes of this nature could explain the presence of a diffuse intermediate age population in the inner galactic bulge ( wood & bessell 1983 ; harmon & gilmore 1988 ; lopez - corredoira , garzon , & hammersley 2001 ; but see also ven der veen & habing 1990 ) .",
    "the spatial distribution of the c stars seen in bulge 1 and 2 provide clues about their origins .",
    "if they formed in a nuclear region then it can be anticipated that they would be concentrated towards smaller radii .",
    "such a trend is not seen in the altair data , although the uncertainties are high .",
    "the very red objects in the stephens et al .",
    "( 2003 ) sample , which were identified as lpvs in that study , are also uniformly distributed .",
    "perhaps the greatest challenge to any model that tries to associate the c stars with nuclear star formation comes from the @xmath111 cmds of the innermost regions of m31 constructed by davidge ( 2001 ) .",
    "these cmds have relatively tight , well - defined sequences , with only a modest number of red stars near the bright end , indicating that the number density of c stars may actually drop towards very small radii in m31 . given these arguements",
    ", it appears that the c stars did not form in the nuclear regions of m31 , but more likely originated over a much larger area .",
    "studies of late - type spiral galaxies indicate that the density of molecular star - forming material is coupled to disk properties , such as the central disk density ( boker , lisenfeld , & schinnerer 2003 ) , rather than properties of the inner spheroid , and so it is likely that the c stars in bulge 1 and 2 formed as part of the inner disk of m31 , rather than the inner spheroid .",
    "nevertheless , the presence of c stars in the inner regions of m31 suggests that the bulge of this galaxy may be subject to secular processes .",
    "kim & morris ( 2001 ) argue that @xmath112 gyr is required for stars in the inner galaxy to scatter and form an aspect ratio similar to that of the most luminous agb stars in the galactic bulge .",
    "this is shorter than the upper age limit of c stars based on statistical studies ( cole & weinberg 2002 ) , so it is possible that c star progenitors may survive long enough to be redistributed throughout the inner bulge",
    ". a radial velocity study of the bright , red stars that occur throughout the central few arcmin of m31 will provide insight into the nature of these objects .",
    "we close by noting that with r@xmath113 arcmin , bulge 1 does not overlap with the central region that has been the target of population studies based on integrated spectroscopic information .",
    "nevertheless , the spatial distribution of the c stars detected here suggests that they are well - mixed throughout the sight line within a few arcmin of the center of m31 , and so it seems reasonable to expect that some c stars will almost certainly occur at smaller r@xmath110 than sampled by bulge 1 .",
    "if this is the case then the c stars seen here may be the brightest members of the intermediate - age population that has been detected spectroscopically .",
