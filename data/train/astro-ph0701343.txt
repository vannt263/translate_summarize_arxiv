    "no self - respecting theory of the universe can be considered complete without a solution to these problems , the most successful of which is inflation @xcite .    however , inflation is far from rising to the level of a theory .",

    "we consider a restricted class of k - inflation models for which the modification to the scalar kinetic term depends on the field but _ not _ on its derivatives .",
    "this might at first appear to be a trivial modification , since in such a case one can always transform the non - canonical scalar into a canonical one via a field redefinition . however , it is reasonable to expect that some models which appear complex or highly contrived when viewed in a canonical basis may have a simple description in an equivalent non - canonical representation .",
    "therefore , it is useful to develop a set of tools for analyzing slow roll inflation directly in terms of a non - canonical field , without resorting to field redefinitions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : ncinflation ] , we generalize the standard slow roll expansion to the case of simple non - canonical lagrangians , and derive expressions for the scalar and tensor power spectra generated by a non - canonical inflaton . in section [ sec : slinky ] we introduce the example of `` slinky '' inflation @xcite , which is an exactly solvable non - canonical inflation model with a highly nontrivial canonical equivalent which consists of a field oscillating on a _ multi - valued _ potential . in section [ sec : perturbations ] we calculate the curvature power spectrum for slinky inflation , which displays both power - law and oscillatory regions .",
