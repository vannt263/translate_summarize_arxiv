    "since its discovery in the 1970 s @xcite , the nature of the smectic @xmath0- smectic @xmath1 transition has been a topic of great interest .",
    "early work showed that many systems exhibit a continuous @xmath2 transition which could be described by a mean field model near tricriticality . a tricritical point , with associated neighboring 2nd order and weakly 1st order transitions",
    "was later found @xcite .",
    "the origin of an @xmath2 tricritical point has been of significant interest , with two main mechanisms having been proposed .",
    "the first is the coupling of the tilt to biaxiality , which in chiral systems is related to the size of spontaneous polarization @xcite .",
    "the second is the width of the @xmath0 phase .",
    "another mechanism , involving a coupling between tilt and smectic elasticity has also been proposed @xcite , but this seems less likely . until now , a comprehensive theory that addresses the effect of biaxiality on the nature of the @xmath2 transition has not been produced .",
    "more recently , much attention has been given to de vries materials , which exhibit an @xmath2 transition with an unusually small change in layer spacing and a significant increase in birefringence ( associated with an increase in orientational order ) upon entry to the @xmath1 phase @xcite .",
    "some de vries materials exhibit another unusual feature , namely a birefringence that varies nonmonotonically with temperature @xcite ; in particular , the birefringence decreases as the @xmath2 transition is approached from within the @xmath0 phase . de vries materials generally seem to have unusually small orientational order and follow the phase sequence isotropic ( @xmath4 ) - @xmath0 - @xmath1 . in several de vries materials , the @xmath2 transition seems to occur close to tricriticality @xcite .",
    "separate theoretical models @xcite have been developed , each of which predicts the possibility of a continuous @xmath2 transition with the two main signatures of de vries behavior : small layer contraction and increase in birefringence upon entry to the @xmath1 phase .",
    "there are differences between the assumptions used in the models , the most significant of which is the treatment of the temperature dependence of the layering order parameter ; the model of gorkunov _ et al _ @xcite does not take this into account while that of saunders _ et al _ does @xcite . given the absence of a nematic phase in de vries materials , incorporating the temperature variation of the layering order parameter is of crucial importance in the modeling of de vries materials .",
    "it seems most likely that the @xmath5 transition in de vries materials is primarily driven by the development of layering order , with orientational order being secondarily induced by the layering order .",
    "this is consistent with the general observation @xcite that de vries materials have unusually strong layering order and unusually weak orientational order .",
    "additionally , only by including temperature dependent layering , does one predict @xcite the unusual , yet experimentally observed @xcite , possibility of a nonmonotonic temperature dependence of birefringence .",
    "neither model considers the effect of biaxiality on the @xmath2 transition .",

    "the concentration would lead to an increase in the orientational order .",

    "these two boundaries meet at the tricrtical point : ( @xmath7 ) .",

    "the region in which the behavior is @xmath3-like shrinks to zero as the tricritical point is approached .",
    "also shown as double ended arrows , are the three distinct classes of transitions ( at fixed concentration ) : @xmath3-like , tricritical and 1st order . ]    in this article , we present and analyze a new generalized nonchiral landau theory , based on that developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which includes orientational , layering , tilt and biaxial order parameters .",
    "the model naturally produces a coupling between tilt and biaxiality and we show that this coupling leads to an @xmath2 tricritical point .",
    "we show that the effect of biaxiality is stronger in systems with small orientational order , @xmath8 , so that a tricritical point and associated neighboring 1st order transition can be accessed by systems with sufficiently small orientational order , @xmath9 . here",
    "@xmath10 is the value of the orientational order at which the system exhibits a tricritical @xmath2 transition .",
    "this means that the two mechanisms that have been proposed as leading to tricriticality , the coupling of tilt to biaxiality and the width of the @xmath0 phase , may in fact be two sides of the same coin . systems with a narrow @xmath0 phase , which are thus close to the @xmath4 phase , will have small orientational order , which according to our model , leads to an enhanced effect of the biaxiality on the nature of the @xmath2 transition .",
    "for materials with excluded volume interactions , a decrease in orientational order could be achieved by decreasing concentration .",

    "the model is also used to examine the behavior of the layer spacing and birefringence for the three possible transitions ( @xmath3-like , tricritical , 1st order ) .",
    "we show that , for all three types of transitions , an unusually small layer contraction can be directly attributed to unusually small orientational order , @xmath8 .",
