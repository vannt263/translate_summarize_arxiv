    "three discoveries in the last century have radically changed our understanding of the universe - as opposed to the idea of einstein s static universe hubble and slipher(1927 ) showed that it is expanding .",
    "secondly cmbr as also primordial nucleosynthesis analysis in the sixties point to an initial hot dense state of the universe , which has been expanding for the last 13.5 gyr . finally ,",
    "if we put faith in einstein s theory and frw type of model then as standardised candles type ia supernova suggest  @xcite that the universe is undergoing accelerated expansion with baryonic matter contributing only five percent of the total energy budget .",
    "later data from cmbr probes  @xcite also point to the same finding .",
    "this has naturally led a vast chunk of cosmology community to embark on a quest to attempt to explain the cause of the apparent acceleration .",
    "the vexed question in this field is the possible identification of the processes likely to be responsible for triggering the late inflation .",
    "researchers are plainly divided into two broad groups - either modification of the original einstein s theory or introduction of any exotic type of fluid like a cosmological constant or a quintessential type of scalar field .",
    "but the popular explanation with the help of a cosmological constant is beset with serious theoretical problems because absence of acceleration at redshifts @xmath0 implies that the required value of the cosmological constant is approximately 120 orders of magnitude smaller than its natural value in terms of planck scale  @xcite . as for the alternative quintessential field",
    "@xcite we do not in fact have a theory that would explain , not to mention predict , the existence of a scalar field fitting the bill without violating the realistic energy conditions .",
    "moreover we can not generate this type of a scalar field from any basic principles of physics .",
    "other alternatives include k - essence  @xcite , tachyon  @xcite , phantom  @xcite and quintom  @xcite .",
    "so there has been a resurgence of interests among relativists , field theorists , astrophysicists and people doing astroparticle physics both at theoretical and experimental levels to address the problems emanating from the recent extra galactic observations without involving any mysterious form of scalar field by hand but looking for alternative approaches based on sound physical principles .",
    "alternatives include , among others , higher curvature theory , axionic field and also brans- dicke field .",
    "some people attempted to look into the problem from a purely geometric point of view - an approach more in line with einstein s spirits .",
    "for example , wanas  @xcite introduced torsion while neupane  @xcite modifies the spacetime with a warped factor in 5d spacetime in a brane like cosmology and finally addition of extra spatial dimensions in physics as an offshoot of prediction from the string theory  @xcite .",
    "while this torsion inspired inflation has certain desirable features the problem with wanas model is that the geometry is no longer riemannian .",
    "further a good number of people  @xcite have done away with the concept of homogeneity itself and have argued that accelerating model and consequent introduction of exotic matter field have to be invoked only in frw type of cosmology . in tolman",
    "bondi like inhomogeneous model the apparent dimming of the signals may be explained as a consequence of inhomogeneous distribution of matter .",
    "+   + while the above mentioned alternatives to explain away the observed acceleration of the current phase have both positive and negative aspects the one that caught the attention of a large number of workers is the introduction of a chaplygin type of gas as new matter field to simulate a sort of dark energy .",
    "the form of the matter field is later generalised through the addition of an arbitrary constant as exponent over the mass density and is generally referred to as generalised chaplygin gas(gcg )  @xcite . though it suffers from the serious disqualification that it violates the time honoured principle of energy conditions its theoretical conclusions are found to be in broad agreement with the observational results coming out of gravitational lensing or recent cmbr and sne data in varied cosmic probes  @xcite .",
    "this is generally achieved through a careful maneuvering of the value of the newly introduced arbitrary constant . to further fine tune the match between the theory and the very recent observational fallouts the gcg",
    "is again modified via the addition of an ordinary matter field , which is termed in the literature as modified chaplygin gas(mcg )  @xcite .",
    "the viability of such scenarios has been tested by a number of cosmological probes , including sne ia data  @xcite , lensing statistics  @xcite , age - reshift tests@xcite , cmb measurements  @xcite , measurements of x ray luminosity of galaxy clusters  @xcite , statefinder parameters  @xcite . in our previous work",
    "@xcite we have studied chaplygin gas model in inhomogeneous space time . in the present work we have revisited the dynamics of the frw model taking mcg as matter field and have tried to discuss some as yet unexplored region and have got some interesting results .",
    "we have organised the paper as follows : in section 2 the mathematical formulation is given and we have ended up with a hypergeometric solution and also an effective equation of state as @xmath1 in section 3 .",
    "so depending on initial conditions our model mimics both @xmath2 and quiessence models and the evolution is also shown graphically .",
    "we have also made some detailed discussion on acoustic wave in our model and find that all possibilities like less / greater than light velocity and even imaginary values exist in our model .",
    "relevant to mention that imaginary sound velocity is not that much discouraging in this context because it gives rise to perturbation and consequent structure formation  @xcite .",
    "the interesting thing in our analysis is that we have taken the first order approximation of the field equation as key equation and subsequently found out the exact solutions .",
    "we are not aware of attempts of similar kind in the past literature",
    ". moreover it is also found that if an arbitrary constant appearing in our solution be taken negative the cosmology bounces back from a minimum .",
    "we have also made a detailed analysis of flip time both analytically and graphically in this section . in section 4",
    "these conclusions are checked in the framework of well known raychaudhury equation .",
    "the paper ends with a discussion in section 5 .",
    "we consider a spherically symmetric homogeneous spacetime given by @xmath3    where the scale factor , @xmath4 depends on time only .",
    "a comoving coordinate system is taken such that @xmath5 and @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the 4- velocity .",
    "the energy momentum tensor for a dust distribution in the above defined coordinates is given by    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the matter density and @xmath10 the isotropic pressure .",
    "the independent field equations for the metric ( 1 ) and the energy momentum tensor ( 2 ) are given by    @xmath11    @xmath12    from the the bianchi identity we get for the homogeneous model the conservation law    @xmath13    which , in turn , yields    @xmath14    at this stage we assume that we are dealing with a modified chaplygin type of gas ( mcg ) obeying an equation of state    @xmath15    where @xmath16   and  @xmath17 are constants .",
    "the exponent @xmath17 , from most observational constraints , hovers around unity  @xcite and the constant @xmath18 ranges from @xmath19 to zero .",
    "similarly the positive definite constant @xmath20 is also not exactly arbitrary . in the equation ( 7 ) when the last two terms start to be of the same order of magnitude the pressure vanishes . in this case",
    "the fluid has pressureless density@xmath21 corresponding to some cosmological scale @xmath22 given by @xmath23 . many variants of chaplygin gas model have come up in the literature and the equation ( 7 ) refers to what is generally known as the modified chaplygin gas model ( mcg )  @xcite such that @xmath24 gives generalized model ( gcg )  @xcite and if in addition @xmath25 one recovers the original model .",
    "moreover , the first term on the r.h.s . of the equation ( 7 ) gives an ordinary fluid obeying a barotropic equation of state ( eos ) so that we here are essentially dealing with a two fluid model .",
    "further , the equation ( 7 ) points to an eos that interpolates between standard fluids at high energy densities and chaplygin gas fluids at low energy densities . in the 4d framework",
    "the dynamics of the mcg model has been studied in the reference  @xcite and a perturbative study looking for some generic features is carried out in  @xcite . on the other hand fabris _",
    "@xcite , in an interesting work , have used a perturbative analysis to confront observational data within this model and taking the particular case of power spectrum observational data have concluded that the recent data restricts the value of @xmath26 such that the gcg is recovered and the mcg is almost ruled out . moreover , in the case of mcg model recent supernova data seem to favour negative values of the parameter @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "when one attempts to address issues concerning structure formation the study of cases with negative values of @xmath17 becomes more sensible since this implies imaginary sound velocities , hence plagued with the possibility of instabilities  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand it has been argued that @xmath27 is also plausible  @xcite . with the help of equations ( 6 ) & ( 7 ) a little mathematics shows that an expression for density comes out to    @xmath28^{\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha}}\\ ] ]    where @xmath29 is an integration constant .",
    "the above equation ( 8) yields a first integral as @xmath30^{\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha } } \\ ] ]    plugging in the expression of @xmath31 from equations ( 3 ) and ( 9 ) we finally get    @xmath32^{\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha } } \\ ] ]    [ fig : subfigureexample ]    using equation ( 10 ) we have drawn the figure-1 , where the evolution of @xmath4 with @xmath33 is shown .",
    "this figure shows that as @xmath17 increases the rate of change of scale factor decreases .",
    "a cursory look at the equation also points to this type of variation of the curves .",
    "in fact the equation ( 10 ) suggests that with @xmath17 , @xmath34 becomes flatter .",
    "+ at this stage if we consider @xmath35 ( figure-1b ) we get from the equation ( 7 ) that as @xmath17 increases ( @xmath36 ) the first term on the r.h.s . reduces to zero while the second term decreases for a particular @xmath31 .",
    "we get identical results for @xmath37(figure-1c ) .",
    "now , @xmath31 being a small fraction at the late stage of evolution of the universe any increase in its value in the exponent finally increases its magnitude so that the pressure becomes more negative , which , in turn drives the expansion more vigorously .",
    "our analysis is based on different sets of observational data . by using a large sample of milli - arc second radio sources recently updated and extended by gurvits et al  @xcite along with the latest snei data as given by reiss et",
    "al  @xcite , alcaniz and lima  @xcite showed that the best fit data for these observations are @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 ( udme ) and @xmath41 @xmath39 @xmath40 ( cgcdm ) , where @xmath42 , where @xmath21 is the present density of the chaplygin gas . in another work lima et",
    "al  @xcite showed at @xmath43 confidence level by the bao ( baryon acoustic oscillation ) and gold sample analysis , the range of @xmath17 is @xmath44 while bao @xmath39 snls analysis provides @xmath45 .",
    "both the results predict @xmath17 to be nearly equal to unity .",
    "in contrast to this result fabris et al  @xcite as pointed out earlier ruled out the existence of @xmath46 for the mcg model in the context of power spectrum observational data . in this context",
    "the relations @xmath47 and @xmath48 seem interesting .",
    "when the value of @xmath17 is nearly equal to unity there remains a tiny value of @xmath46 , which is not exactly in line with the work of fabris et al  @xcite .",
    "lastly lu et al  @xcite gives for the mcg best fit data @xmath49 and @xmath50 in the light of 3 yr wmap and sdss data .",
    "it is very difficult to get the exact temporal behaviour of the scale factor , @xmath51 from the equation ( 10 ) in a closed form because integration yields elliptical solution only .",
    "however , the equation ( 10 ) does give significant information under extremal conditions as briefly discussed below .",
    "* deceleration parameter : * + at the early stage of the cosmological evolution when the scale factor @xmath4 is relatively small the second term of the last equation ( 10 ) dominates which has been already discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "so we will be very brief on this point . from the expression of the deceleration parameter , @xmath52 we get    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is the hubble constant . with the help of the eos given by ( 7 ) we find    @xmath55    which via equation ( 9 ) gives    @xmath56^{-1}\\ ] ]     and @xmath31 for different values of @xmath17 . here",

    "i.e. _ , flip occurs at a lower density , _",
    "i.e. _ , it occurs at a later time .",
    "we know from lima s  @xcite that the value of @xmath17 is restricted to @xmath60 such that acceleration is a recent phenomenon .",
    "this result is encouraging . as discussed in the last section",
    "lu et al  @xcite argued that @xmath61 also conforms to the observational analysis .",
    "this finding is particularly relevant to our case in the sense that higher values of @xmath17 signify a lower @xmath59 , i.e. , more recent accelerating phase . the above analysis in conformity with the nature of @xmath62 curve in figure-2 .",
    "* case  a :*   at the early stage when the scale factor , @xmath4 is very small the equation ( 13 ) reduces to    @xmath63    evidently the deceleration parameter has contribution from the baryonic matter content only such that , @xmath52 mimcs the ordinary fluid behaviour with magnitudes @xmath64 and @xmath65 for radiation and dust respectively as in a frw model . when @xmath66 the equation ( 14 ) gives , @xmath67 evolving as a @xmath2 model .",

    "we also find that at the late stage of evolution as @xmath71 , @xmath72 so we asymptotically get @xmath73 from this chaplygin type of gas , which corresponds to an empty universe with cosmological constant such that the equation ( 11 ) implies that the deceleration parameter , @xmath74 reduces to @xmath75 . interestingly @xmath76 always remains greater than @xmath75 , thus avoiding the undesirable feature of big rip . in this context",
    "we call attention to a recent work of z. k. guo and y. z. zhang @xcite where a new variant of cg is taken in the form of    @xmath77    where unlike the original cg , @xmath20 is taken as a function of the scale factor @xmath51 . for mathematical simplicity",

    "we have studied the key equation ( 10 ) with the help of deceleration parameter . from the definition of the deceleration parameter @xmath52",
    "we have calculated the flip density @xmath59 . at the larger values of @xmath17 the @xmath59 decreases , i.e. , flip occurs at lower density or at a later time .",
    "since the acceleration is a recent phenomena , this result is in agreement with the observational analysis that the value of @xmath17 is nearly equal to the unity ( @xmath17 is @xmath112 ) . from the figure-2",

    "so we asymptotically get @xmath219 from this chaplygin type of gas , which corresponds to an empty universe with cosmological constant such that the equation ( 11 ) implies that the deceleration parameter , @xmath74 tries to attain to @xmath75 .",
