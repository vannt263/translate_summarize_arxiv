    "recently it has been shown ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) that intermittent pulsations can be observed during the transient outbursts of some accreting millisecond pulsars ( amps ) .",
    "it was emphasized ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) that a new class of pulsators is emerging with a variety of phenomenology i.e. , pulsations lasting only for the first two months of the outburst ( hete j1900.1 - 2455 , @xcite , @xcite ) , switching on and off throughout the observations ( sax j1748.9 - 2021 , @xcite , and hete j1900.1 - 2455 @xcite ) , or even appearing for only  150 s over 1.3 ms of observations ( aql x-1 , @xcite ) .",
    "this is different from the behavior of other known amps , where the pulsations persist throughout the outburst until they drop below the sensitivity level of the instrumentation .",
    "@xcite and @xcite pointed out the clear , albeit non - trivial , connection between the appearance of pulsations in hete j1900.1 - 2455 and sax j1748.9 - 2021 and the occurrence of thermonuclear bursts ( type i x - ray bursts ) .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that increases of pulse amplitude in hete j1900.0@xmath02455 sometimes but not always follow the occurrence of type i bursts nor do all bursts trigger an increase in pulse amplitude .",
    "@xcite showed that in  the pulsations can re - appear after an absence of pulsations of a few orbital periods or even a few hundred seconds .",
    "all the pulsing episodes occur close in time to the detection of a type i x - ray burst , but again not all the type i bursts are followed by pulsations so it is unclear if the pulsations are indeed triggered by type i x - ray bursts .",
    "+ the pulse energy dependence and the spectral state in which pulsations are detected also differ between these objects .",
    "as shown by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , the fractional amplitude of the pulsations in amps monotonically decreases with increasing energies between 2 and @xmath1kev .",
    "however in igr j00291 + 5934 , @xcite found a slight decrease in the pulse amplitude between 5 and 8 kev followed by an increase up to energies of 100 kev .",
    "for the single pulse episode of aql x-1 the pulsation amplitude increased with energy between 2 and @xmath1kev ( @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly in aql x-1 the pulsations appeared during the soft state , contrary to all the other known amps which pulsate solely in their hard state ( although many of these objects have not been observed in a soft state ) .",
    "therefore it is interesting to investigate these issues for  as well .",
    "+ in order to study these various aspects of  an improved timing solution is necessary .",
    "the spin frequency of the neutron star and the orbital parameters of  were measured by @xcite using a frequency - domain technique that measures the doppler shift of the pulsar spin period due to the orbital motion of the neutron star around the center of mass of the binary .",
    "the source was found to be spinning at a frequency of 442.361 hz in a binary with an orbit of  8.7 hrs and a donor companion mass of @xmath2 .",
    "however , the timing solution obtained with this technique was not sufficiently precise to phase connect between epochs of visible pulsations .",
    "the intermittency of the pulsations creates many gaps between measurable pulse arrival times , complicating the use of standard techniques to phase connect the times of arrival ( toas ) .",
    "the current work presents a follow - up study to the discovery paper of intermittent pulsations in  ( @xcite ) and provides for the first time a timing solution obtained by phase connecting the pulsations observed during the 2001 outburst . in ",
    "2 we present the observations and in  3 we explain the technique employed to phase connect the pulsations . in ",
    "4 we show our results and in  5 we discuss them . in  6 we outline our conclusions .",
    "we reduced all the pointed observations from the _ rxte _ proportional counter array ( pca , @xcite ) that cover the 1998 , 2001 and 2005 outbursts of .",
    "the pca instrument provides an array of five proportional counter units ( pcus ) with a collecting area of 1200 @xmath3 per unit operating in the 2 - 60 kev range and a field of view of @xmath4 . the number of active pcus during the observations varied between two and five .",
    "we used all the data available in the event mode with a time resolution of @xmath5 and 64 binned energy channels and in the good xenon mode with a time resolution of @xmath6 and 256 unbinned channels ; the latter were re - binned in time to a resolution of @xmath7 .",
    "all the observations are listed in table 1 .",
    ".observations analyzed for each outburst[tbl : obslist ] [ cols= \" < , > , > , > , < \" , ]     [ table2:data ]    to check whether the timing noise is energy dependent , we selected three energy bands : a soft band ( 5 - 13 kev ) , an intermediate band ( 11 - 17 kev ) and a hard one ( 13 - 24 kev )",
    ". then we repeated the procedure , fitting all the significant toas with a constant spin frequency and circular keplerian orbit , without increasing the statistical errors on the toas .",
    "the two solutions of the soft and intermediate bands were in agreement to within 1@xmath8 for @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11@xmath12 , while the hard band solution deviated by more than 3@xmath8 for the spin frequency .",
    "the reduced @xmath13 of the sinusoidal fit to the pulse profiles in the highest energy band was systematically larger than in the other two bands . fitting a second and a third harmonic",
    "did not significantly improve the fit according to an f - test .",
    "the bad @xmath13 can be ascribed to a non - poissonian noise process that dominates at high energies or to an intrinsic non - sinusoidal shape of the pulse profiles .",
    "since the hard energy band has a count rate approximately 10 times smaller than the soft band , the influence of this on the global timing solution calculated for the energy band 5 - 24 kev is negligible .",
    "we refolded all the profiles and calculated another solution for the 5 - 17 kev energy band to avoid the region of high energies and found an agreement to within 1@xmath8 with the solution reported in table 2 and with the solution obtained for the 5 - 13 kev and for the 11 - 17 kev energy bands .",
    "this also shows that the timing noise is substantially independent from the energy band selected for energies below 17 kev .",
    "we checked for the possible existence of characteristic frequencies in a power density spectrum ( pds ) of the timing residuals using a lomb - scargle technique .",
    "no peaks above three sigma were found in either the pds of the upper and lower group toas or the pds of the global solution combining these two groups .",
    "the post - fit timing residuals are also not correlated with the reduced @xmath13 of each fitted pulse profile .",
    "we also checked the influence of very large events ( vle ) due to energetic particles in the detector on the toa residuals but no correlation was found .",
    "there is also no link between the source flux and the magnitude of the timing residuals and between the timing residuals and the orbital phase .      to look for possible pulse profile changes",
    ", we fitted all significant folded pulse profiles with a fundamental and a second harmonic sinusoid ( plus a constant level ) .",
    "no significant second harmonic detections ( @xmath14 ) were made in the 5 - 24 kev energy band with upper limits of 0.9% , 0.5% and 0.4% rms amplitude at 98@xmath15 confidence for the 1998 , 2001 and 2005 pulsations episodes respectively .",
    "we repeated the procedure for different energy bands , obtaining similar results .",
    "+ the pulse profiles of  are therefore extremely sinusoidal with the fundamental amplitude at least @xmath16 times that of the second harmonic both in the soft and hard energy bands .",
    "thus there are no detectable pulse profile shape variations nor the possibility to detect sudden changes of the relative phase between the fundamental and the second harmonic such as observed in sax j1808.4 - 3658 ( @xcite , @xcite ) and xte j1814 - 338 @xcite .",
    "we analyzed the energy dependence of the pulse profiles selecting ten energy bands and measuring the strength of the pulsations .",
    "we folded all the observations where we detect significant pulsations .",
    "the pulse fraction is as small as @xmath17 rms between 2.5 and 4 kev and increases up to @xmath18 rms above 17 kev following a linear trend .",
    "counting statistics prevents the measurement of pulsations above 24 kev . fitting a linear relation to the points in fig .",
    "[ energy ] gives a slope of @xmath19 .",
    "the pulses of  exhibit a similar energy dependence to aql x-1 @xcite , which is opposite to that measured in three other amps ( sax j1808.4 - 3658 @xcite , xte j1751 - 305 @xcite , xte j0929 - 314 @xcite ) , where the amplitude is stronger at low energies and decreases at high energies . in another source",
    "however ( igr j00291 + 5934 ) @xcite pointed out an increase of the fractional amplitude with energy which seems to resemble what has been observed for  and aql x-1 . in igr j00291",
    "+ 5934 a slight decrease in the fractional amplitude between 5 and 8 kev is followed by a slight increase up to 100 kev . however between 6 and 24",
    "kev the slight increase is also consistent with a constant when considering the 1@xmath8 error bars . in  and",
    "aql x-1 the increase in fractional amplitude with energy is much steeper .",
    "we did not detect any significant time lag between soft and hard photons , with an upper limit of @xmath20s at the @xmath21 level , using a coherent analysis between the 2.5 and 24 kev bands ( see fig .  [ energy ] ) .",
    "if a time lag with a magnitude smaller than our limit exists , this might explain the dependence of toa on pulse amplitude if for example low amplitude pulses are dominated by soft photons whereas the high amplitude pulses are dominated by hard photons or vice versa . to check this possibility",
    "we re - folded all the low and high amplitude pulses selecting a low energy ( 5 - 13 kev ) and an high energy band ( 13 - 24 kev ) .",
    "the folded profiles do not show any strong energy dependence , with the low and high energy bands equally contributing to the low and high amplitude profiles .",
    "therefore energy dependent lags are unlikely to be the origin of the toa dependence on amplitude .      in both the 2001 and 2005 outbursts the pulsations disappear at both low and high x - ray flux . in fig .",
    "[ lc_pulses ] we show the light curve of the 2001 outburst , with pulsating episodes indicated with filled circles .",
    "the pulses appear in a broad flux band but not below @xmath22 and not above @xmath23 .",
    "it is also intriguing that pulsations sporadically disappear on a timescale of a few hundred seconds even when the flux is in the band where we see pulsations .",
    "the few non - pulsating episodes at high and low flux could be random , however some non - pulsing episodes are observed at the same fluxes where we observe pulsations at different times .",
    "this indicates the absence of a flux threshold above or below which the pulse formation mechanism is at work .",
    "the possibility that the pulsations are triggered by type i x - ray bursts can be tested by measuring the evolution of the fractional amplitude of the pulsations in time .",
    "our time resolution corresponds to the time interval selected to fold the data , i.e. , @xmath24s . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ resamp ] , there are cases in which the fractional amplitude increases after a type i burst ( e.g. , mjd 52191.74 , 52192.25 , 52192.31 , 52196.24 , 52198.2 , 52198.36 , 53534.46 ) on timescales of a few hundred seconds , while after other type i bursts the fractional amplitude does not change significantly ( mjd 52190.38 , 52190.47 , 52193.32 , 52193.40 , 52193.45 , 52195.3 , 52195.5 ) or increased prior to the type i burst ( mjd 52195.62 ) . in four cases pulsations are present without any occurrence of a type i burst ( mjd 52181,52190.30 , 52191.65 , 52198.27 ) and in one case the fractional amplitude decreases after the burst ( mjd 52192.40 ) . clearly there is no single response of the pulsation characteristics to the occurrence of a burst .",
    "there is also no clear link between the strength of a type i burst and the increase of the pulsation amplitudes as is evident from fig .",
    "[ resamp ] . the maximum fractional amplitude ( @xmath25 rms ) is reached during the 2005 outburst , after a type i x - ray burst .",
    "however , after @xmath26s the pulsations were not seen anymore .",
    "we use the 16 s time resolution standard 2 mode data to calculate x - ray colors .",
    "hard and soft colors are defined respectively as the 9.716.0 kev / 6.09.7 kev and the 3.56.0 kev / 2.03.5 kev count rate ratio .",
    "the energy - channel conversion is done using the pca_e2c_e05v02 table provided by the rxte team .",
    "type i x - ray bursts were removed , background subtracted , and dead - time corrections made . in order to correct for the gain changes as well as the differences in effective area between the pcus themselves",
    ", we normalized our colors by the corresponding crab nebula color values ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see table 2 in @xcite for average colors of the crab nebula per pcu ) that are closest in time but in the same rxte gain epoch , i.e. , with the same high voltage setting of the pcus @xcite .",
    "the pca observations sample the source behavior during three different outbursts ( see fig 1 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in figure  [ ccd ]",
    "we show the color  color diagram for all the observations of the three outbursts .",
    "grey circles mark the 16 second averaged colors while black crosses and triangles mark the average color of each of the 8 observations from which pulsations were detected . as it can be seen , pulsations only appear in soft state of the source ( banana state ) . during the observations of the 1998 outburst , the source was always in the so called island / extreme island state while during the 2001 and 2005 outburst the source was observed in both island and banana state .",
    "we also used the new phase - coherent timing solution presented here to search for possible radio pulsations from sax j1748.9@xmath02021 .",
    "for this , we used 2-ghz archival radio data from green bank telescope ( gbt ) observations of the 6 known radio millisecond pulsars ( msps ) in the globular cluster ( gc ) ngc  6440 ( see @xcite for a description of these data ) .",
    "the known radio pulsars in ngc  6440 have spin periods from 3.8@xmath0288.6ms and dispersion measures ( dms ) between 219@xmath0227pc @xmath27 . with a spin period of 2.3ms ,",
    "sax  j1748.9@xmath02021 is thus the fastest - spinning pulsar known in ngc  6440 , where the average spin period of the radio pulsars ( 11.3ms when the 288-ms pulsar b1745@xmath020 is excluded ) is relatively long compared to other gcs .",
    "we searched 11 data sets taken between 2006 december and 2007 march .",
    "these data sets have total integration times between @xmath28hr and a combined total time of 20.3hr ( 73ks ) .",
    "the data were dedispersed into 10 time series with trial dms between 219@xmath0228pc @xmath27 . to check",
    "if pulsations were present , these time series were then folded with the timing solution presented in this paper . because potential radio pulsations may also be transient , we folded not only the full data sets , but also overlapping chunks of 1/4 , 1/10 , and 1/50 of the individual data set ( thus probing timescales between 100s and hours ) . furthermore , because these data were taken 6 years after the data that was used to construct the timing solution , we folded the data using both the exact period prediction from the timing solution as well as allowing for a small search around this value .",
    "no obvious pulsations were detected in this analysis , where the reduced @xmath29 of the integrated pulse profile was used to judge if a given fold was worthy of further investigation .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising as radio pulsations have , as of yet , never been detected from an lmxb or amp .",
    "nonetheless , we plan to continue these searches on the large amount of available radio data which we have not yet searched with this technique .",
    "we have presented a new timing solution for obtained by phase connecting the 2001 outburst pulsations .",
    "we discovered the presence of timing noise on short ( hundred seconds ) and long ( few days ) timescales .",
    "we can not exclude the presence of timing noise on different timescales , since the short and the long timescales found are also the two timescales the toas probe .",
    "the pulse profiles of  keep their sinusoidal shape below 17 kev throughout the outburst , but do experience considerable shifts relative to the co - rotating reference frame both apparently randomly as a function of time and systematically with amplitude . above 17 kev",
    "the pulse profiles show deviations from a sinusoidal shape that can not be modeled adding a 2nd harmonic .",
    "the fit needs a very high number of harmonics to satisfactory account the shape of the pulsation .",
    "this is probably due to the effect of some underlying unknown non - poissonian noise process that produces several sharp spikes in the pulse profiles .",
    "the lack of a detectable second harmonic prevents us from studying shape variations of the pulse profiles such as was done for sax j1808.43658 @xcite where sudden changes between the phase of the fundamental and the second harmonic were clearly linked with the outburst phase . +",
    "another interesting aspect is the energy dependence of the pulse profiles , which can be a test of current pulse formation theories . in one model of amps ,",
    "@xcite explain the pulsations by a modulation of comptonized radiation whose seeds photons come from blackbody radiation .",
    "the thermal emission is given by the hot spot and/or emitting column produced by the in - falling material that follows the magnetic dipole field lines of the neutron star plasma rotating with the surface of the neutron star .",
    "part of the blackbody photons can be scattered to higher energies by a slab of shocked plasma that forms a comptonizing region above the hot spot @xcite .    in three amps",
    "@xcite the fractional pulse amplitudes decreases toward high energies with the soft photons always lagging the hard ones .",
    "however in  the energy dependence is opposite , with the fractional pulse amplitudes increasing toward higher energies and no detectable lags ( although the large upper limit of @xmath30s does not rule out the presence of time lags with magnitude similar to those detected in other amps ) .",
    "moreover , all the pulsating episodes happen when the source is in the soft state ( although not all soft states show pulsations ) .",
    "this is similar to aql x-1 ( see @xcite ) where the only pulsating episode occurred during a soft state , and the pulsed fraction also increased with energy .",
    "remarkably all the other sources which show persistent pulsations have hard colors typical of the extremely island state .    both the energy dependence and the presence of the pulsations during the soft state strongly suggest a pulse formation pattern for these two intermittent sources which is different from that of the other known amps and the intermittent pulsar hete j1900.1 - 2455 . as discussed in @xcite , @xcite , a hot spot region emitting as a blackbody with a temperature constrast with respect to the neutron star surface produces pulsations with an increasing fractional amplitude with energy in the observer rest frame .",
    "the exact variation of the fractional amplitude with energy however has a complex dependence on several free parameters as the mass and radius of the neutron star and the number , size , position and temperature of the hot spot and viewing angle of the observer .",
    "the observed slope of 0.2@xmath31 is consistent with this scenario , i.e. , a pure blackbody emission from a hot spot with a temperature constrast and a weak comptonization ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however it is not possible to exclude a strong comptonization given the unknown initial slope of the fractional amplitude .",
    "the pulse shapes above 17 kev are non - sinusoidal and are apparently affected by some non - poissonian noise process or can be partially produced by an emission mechanism different from the one responsible of the formation of the soft pulses ( see for example @xcite for an explaination of how the soft pulses can form ) .",
    "we found that the toas of the pulsations are independent of the energy band below 17 kev but selection on the fractional amplitude of the pulsations strongly affects the toas : high amplitude pulses arrive later .",
    "however , this does not affect the timing solution beyond what is expected from fitting other data selections : apparently the toas are affected by correlated timing noise . if we take into account the timing noise ( @xmath32 ) in estimating the parameter errors , then the timing solutions are consistent to within 2@xmath8 .",
    "in the following we examine several possibilities for the physical process producing the @xmath32 term .",
    "the occurrence of type i x - ray bursts in coincidence with the appearance of the pulsations suggests a possible intriguing relation between the two phenomena .",
    "however as we have seen in  4.4 , there is not a strict link between the appearance of pulsations and type i burst episodes . only after @xmath33 of the type",
    "i bursts the pulsations appeared or increased their fractional amplitude .",
    "the appearance of pulsations seems more related with a period of global surface activity during which both the pulsations and the type i bursts occur .",
    "this is different from what has been observed in hete j1900.1 - 2455 @xcite where the type i x - ray bursts were followed by an increase of the pulse amplitudes that were exponentially decaying with time .",
    "we note that during the pulse episodes at mjd 52191.7 , 52193.40 , 52193.45 and 52195.5 the toa residuals just before and after a type i burst are shifted by 300 - 500@xmath34s suggesting a possible good candidate for the large timing noise observed .",
    "however in two other episodes no substantial shift is observed in the timing residuals ( see fig .  [ resamp ] ) .",
    "we also note that there is no relation between the type i burst peak flux and the magnitude of the shifts in the residuals .",
    "the timing noise and its larger amplitude in the weak pulses might be related with some noise process that becomes effective only when the pulsations have a low fractional amplitude .",
    "@xcite have shown that above certain critical mass transfer rates an unstable regime of accretion can set in , giving rise to low-@xmath35 modes in the accreting plasma which produce an irregular light curve .",
    "the appearance of these modes inhibits magnetic channeling and hence dilutes the coherent variability of the pulsations .",
    "such a model can explain pulse intermittency by positing that we see the pulses only when the accretion flow is stable .",
    "the predominance of timing noise in the low fractional amplitude group could be explained if with the onset of unstable accretion the @xmath35-modes gradually set in and affect the pulsations , lowering their fractional amplitude until they are undetectable .",
    "however the lack of a correlation between pulse fractional amplitude and x - ray flux is not predicted by the model .",
    "another interesting aspect are the apparent large jumps that we observe in the phase residuals on a timescale of a few hundred seconds .",
    "similar jumps have been observed for example in sax j1808.4 - 3658 during the 2002 and 2005 outbursts ( @xcite . in that case however the phases jump by approximately 0.2 spin cycles on a timescale of a few days , while here we observe phase jumps of about 0.4 cycles on a timescale of hundred seconds .",
    "other amps where phase jumps were observed ( xte j1814 - 338 @xcite , xte j1807 - 294 @xcite ) have shown timescales of a few days similar to sax j1808.4 - 3658 .",
    "this is a further clue that the kind of noise we are observing in  is somewhat different from what has been previously observed .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to phase connect the intermittent pulsations seen in  and we have found a coherent timing solution for the spin period of the neutron star and for the keplerian orbital parameters of the binary . + we found strong correlated timing noise in the post - fit residuals and we discovered that this noise is strongest in low fractional amplitude pulses and is not related with the orbital phase . higher - amplitude ( @xmath36 rms ) pulsations arrive systematically later than lower - amplitude ( @xmath37 rms ) ones , by on average 145@xmath38s .",
    "the pulsations of  are sinusoidal in the 5 - 17 kev band , with a fractional amplitude linearly increasing in the energy range considered .",
    "the pulsations appear when the source is in the soft state , similarly to what has been previously found in the intermittent pulsar aql x-1 .",
    "the origin of the intermittency is still unknown , but we can rule out a one - to - one correspondence between type i x - ray bursts and the appearance of pulsations ."
