    "over the last hundred years , a vast amount of experimental evidence about anomalous transport processes has accumulated in the scientific literature  @xcite .",
    "this triggered a lot of theoretical research aiming to understand and predict such processes , and as a consequence , a great variety of mathematical models for anomalous diffusion have been proposed . among these models ,",
    "the most successful in terms of predictions and wide range of applications are the continuous time random walk formalism , the lvy flights model , and the fractional generalizations of the advection - diffusion equation  @xcite .",
    "such models are specially well suited for describing sub and superdiffusion due to scale free waiting times and jump lengths in the diffusing particle dynamics , but give poor results for anomalous diffusion due to long range correlations in the particle displacements  @xcite .",
    "this type of anomalous diffusion ( superdiffusion or subdiffusion caused by long - range correlation ) is ubiquitous in pre - fractal and heterogeneous porous media  @xcite , and a considerable fraction of the models found in the literature were developed to describe it . to our knowledge",
    ", the first generalization of the diffusion equation for fractal geometries was proposed by oshaughnessy and procaccia  @xcite , and although they did not solved the problem , they gave a good approximation for the probability distribution function for finding a diffusing particle at a distance @xmath0 from the origin at time @xmath1 , for specific fractal domains .",
    "this led the scientific community to develop several generalizations of the diffusion equation for describing diffusion in pre - fractal geometries  @xcite , and even though this is still an open problem , some of these models are valid models for anomalous diffusion and a good starting point to study the consequences that this transport process has in phenomena where diffusion plays an important role . as an example of this ,",
    "think of diffusion limited chemical reactions and all the interesting dynamical states exhibited by these systems : how does anomalous diffusion affect their dynamic behavior or the conditions for their appearance ?",
    "is it possible for chemical systems to generate exotic emergent structures under anomalous diffusion conditions ? in this context , there are some studies about the interplay between anomalous diffusion and turing patterns , and also between anomalous diffusion and wave - front propagation in chemical systems  @xcite ; however in the majority of these cases anomalous diffusion was modelled either with the continuous time random walk formalism or with fractional derivatives  @xcite .",
    "although these approaches are interesting from a mathematical point of view and because their potential physicochemical implications , like weaker conditions for diffusion driven instabilities in a system of two chemicals under subdiffusion , or turing patterns moving with constant velocity , they still need experimental verification , and some of them , a derivation form first principles.on the other hand , the essential ingredient in many of the generalized diffusion equations for transport in pre - fractal geometries or highly heterogeneous porous media , and in particular the model put forward by oshaughnessy and procaccia , is a space - dependent diffusion coefficient with a power - law functional form  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we explore the effects of this type of diffusion coefficients ( and therefore , of this type of anomalous diffusion ) in the context of pattern formation in reaction - diffusion systems ; more precisely , in the emergence of concentration patterns generated through a diffusion driven instability.the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . as a part of the introduction , subsection [ ssec:1 ] , we deduce the generalized diffusion equation we use along the paper and discuss some of its properties . in section [ sec:2 ] we present the reaction - diffusion model and find the necessary and sufficient conditions for a diffusion driven instability along with the generalized dispersion relation . in section [ sec:3 ]",
    "we present and discuss the numerical results for normal diffusion , subdiffusion and superdiffusion .",
    "finally , in section [ sec:4 ] we draw some conclusions about this work .",
    "+      in the absence of chemical reactions , the concentration of any chemical species must fulfill the local conservation law given by the continuity equation @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the particle flux at point @xmath4 at time @xmath1 and @xmath5 ; @xmath6 represents a space - dependent diffusion coefficient and @xmath7 the local concentration of a chemical species at time @xmath1 .",
    "+ we consider the spatial region where diffusion takes place as a two dimensional disk , and assume that the medium heterogeneities are only along the radial coordinate . therefore , the diffusion coefficient must be a function of the radial coordinate only , and by hypothesis is given by @xmath8 with @xmath9 a constant with the appropriate physical units .",
    "+ writing the particle flux in polar coordinates @xmath10 ( with @xmath11 and @xmath12 unitary vectors along the radial and azimuthal directions respectively ) , and substituting it in eq.([eq : econt ] ) , we arrive at the following two dimensional generalized diffusion equation @xmath13 the first important thing to notice about eq.([eq : ediff ] ) is that it implies an anomalous behaviour for the mean square displacement for the chemical species @xmath14 ; this is shown in the following expression  @xcite @xmath15 from eq.([eq : msd ] ) it follows that for positive values of @xmath16 , eq.([eq : ediff ] ) describes a subdiffusive regime , whereas for negative values of such parameter a superdiffusive regime is implied . at this point , it is important to mention that , when equations of the type eq.([eq : ediff ] ) has been proposed in the literature for studying diffusion in domains with pre - fractal structure , the parameter @xmath16 is always taken positive  @xcite , and when deduced in such a context , it also takes positive values  @xcite . in our case",
    "we consider that @xmath16 takes either positive or negative values , implying that in this work , eq.([eq : ediff ] ) is not intended to describe diffusion in domains with fractal structure , instead it is taken as a model of anomalous diffusion for heterogeneous domains .",
    "+ when eq.([eq : ediff ] ) is posed as an initial boundary value problem with homogeneous boundary conditions , the eigenfunctions associated to each of the differential operators can be obtained using separation of variables , _",
    "i.e. _ by assuming a solution of the form @xmath17 , it follows that the radial , temporal and angular functions satisfy the eigenvalue equations @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 with @xmath21 , are constants of separation given by the following expressions : @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",

    "+ notice that for each number @xmath81 lying inside the instability window , _ i.e. _ whenever they lie between the numbers shown in eq.([eq : zerosh ] ) , the corresponding eigenmode will grow exponentially fast until the nonlinear terms comes into play and saturate its growth .",

    "this result means that for fixed chemical kinetics parameters , it is easier to have several unstable eigenmodes in the superdiffusive regime than in the normal and subdiffusive cases , implying that turing patterns with mixed symmetries are more likely to occur under superdiffusion conditions .",

    "depending on the kinetic parameters @xmath89 and @xmath90 , turing patterns in the * bvam * model under normal diffusion conditions are either spots or stripes ; the quadratic term @xmath90 favors spots while the cubic term @xmath89 produces stripes  @xcite . using values for these kinetic parameters such that spot patterns are favoured , barrio _ et al .",
    "_ show that hexagonal and pentagonal patterns ( centrosymmetric and noncentrosymmetric ) are the most pervasive symmetries for turing patterns on circular geometries of different size .",
    "this result can be seen in fig.([fig:2 ] ) , where the symmetries of the obtained concentration patterns are plotted as a function of disc radius .",
    "the numerical calculations made for this figure were done with an increase in @xmath91 parameter of @xmath92 units .",
    "the sparse regions ( no symmetries reported ) of fig.([fig:2 ] ) are regions were the patterns symmetries were not clear , and could be solutions without rotational symmetry or more symmetric solutions with deffects ; such cases were not included in the figure .",
    "+    in fig.([fig:3 ] ) we show centrosymmetric pentagonal and hexagonal turing patterns , and two new symmetries that were not reported in barrio s _ et al . _",
    "work for normal diffusion conditions , _",
    "i.e. _ two - fold and tetra symmetric turing patterns .",
    "+ in figure ( [ fig:4 ] ) we show the symmetries obtained under subdifussive conditions as a function of disc radius for the same values of @xmath91 used for fig.([fig:2 ] ) .",
    "notice that in both cases , fig.([fig:4]a ) and fig.([fig:4]b ) , centrosymmetric patterns are more frequent than their normal diffusive counterpart , confirming the linear analysis result which states that it is easier to find pure symmetries ( one or few excited eigenmodes ) when subdiffusion is present .",
    "moreover , notice that the first well defined rotational symmetries appear at smaller radius than in the normal diffusion case , and that the symmetry - radius structure of fig.([fig:2 ] ) change completely as subdiffusion becomes stronger , with new symmetries ( eigth - fold symmetry ) added for the strongest subdiffusive case ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "+    in fig.([fig:5 ] ) we show three and eight - fold symmetric turing patterns obtained under the subdiffusive regime .",
    "notice that because the eigenfunctions with @xmath94 are zero at the origin , the eight - fold symmetric turing pattern must be a mixture of more than one unstable eigen - mode .",
    "this is also the case for the five and six - fold symmetric turing patterns of fig.([fig:3]a ) and fig.([fig:3]b ) for normal diffusion . for a more thorough discussion about this point see  @xcite .      when the system is in the superdiffusive regime , _",
    "i.e. _ when @xmath95 , stationary concentration patterns with rotational symmetries are less common .",
    "however , for weak superdiffusive regimes , _",
    "i.e. _ for @xmath96 and for the @xmath91 parameter explored values , many of them still conserve some of the original symmetries of the stationary steady state , _",
    "i.e. _ reflection symmetries . on the other hand , as the superdiffusive regime becomes stronger , some interesting mixtures of symmetries and spiral - like patterns appear , see fig.([fig:6 ] ) , and most importantly , scale - invariant or self - similar turing patterns emerge , see fig.([fig:7 ] ) and ( [ fig:8 ] ) .",
    "the fact that turing systems under appropriate conditions can produce well organized self - similar concentration patterns is an interesting result , since to our knowledge , all physicochemical systems capable of producing structure at a wide range of length scales , produce only structures with statistical self - similarities or disordered fractals ; think for example in critical phase transitions or the percolation and diffusion limited aggregation models  @xcite . in the context of physicochemical systems which produce structure through spontaneous symmetry breaking , this is also the case , see for example sharon _",
    "_ study of fractal patterns on thin sheets and biological membranes  @xcite .",
    "+ also in the superdiffusive regime , we found centrosymmetric ( or almost centrosymmetric ) patterns which did not repeat the same motif at different scales , examples of this kind of patterns can be seen in fig.([fig:9 ] ) .",
    "+    finally , it is worth mentioning that in the superdiffuve regime , our linear stability analysis is only valid for @xmath97 $ ] . for @xmath57 , berding and",
    "colleagues  @xcite , showed that the eigenfunctions of the generalized diffusion equation , the equivalent of eq.([eq : eigdif ] ) for @xmath57 , in an annular domain with zero flux boundary conditions , are @xmath98 with @xmath46 and @xmath99 integers .",
    "interestingly , in this work , the authors also show that the level curves of eq.([eq : eigdifi ] ) are logarithmic spirals .",
    "opposite to many physicochemical systems that are capable to generate structure at a wide range of length scales , structures which are commonly considered as disordered pre - fractals , this work shows that some diffusion limited chemical reactions under specific conditions can produce well ordered , self - similar stationary concentration patterns . although this exotic emergent structures are consequence of a special type of superdiffusion generated by the medium heterogeneity , which is still open to debate and experimental verification , we believe this is an important result , since in many real systems , specially in biology , self - similar well ordered structures are common .",
