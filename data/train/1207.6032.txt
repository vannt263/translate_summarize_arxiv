    "ever since showed an ir excess in some wc9 stars , it has been known that certain late - type wcs produce dust .",
    "this dust is composed of amorphous carbon grains and its formation is also favored in suitable wc + o binaries ( i.e. binaries with large enough separations with respect to each star s luminosity , so that the ionizing flux from the stars can not prevent dust formation ) , presumably because of the high densities attained in the shocked region between the colliding winds .",
    "cv ser (= hd 168206 = wr113 , @xmath2 ( j2000.0 ) = 18:19:07.36 , @xmath3 ( j2000.0 ) = -11:37:59.2 , v = 9.2 ) is a long - studied wc8d+o8 - 9iv spectroscopic binary @xcite with atmospheric eclipses and a 29.704d period @xcite .",
    "following the first published light - curve by @xcite , various other light curves have shown different eclipse depths or even no eclipse whatsoever ( e.g. ) .",
    "different explanations were given , including the possibility that the authors had used the wrong orbital period .",
    "however , even when no eclipses were found in the optical continuum , @xcite showed that the system was still eclipsing in the @xmath4 emission line ( confirmed by @xcite ) .",
    "since then , two most ( microvariability and oscillations of stars ; see below ) runs conducted in 2009 and 2010 also show varying depths , possibly implying a varying mass - loss rate .",
    "cv ser was also shown to produce dust .",
    "this phenomenon was seen as a plausible explanation for the variation in its optical eclipses .",
    "it has since been classified as a persistent dust producer @xcite .",
    "several studies have been carried out to refine the orbital solution of cv ser .",
    "most of them found a quasi circular orbit ( e.g. @xcite ) but more recently , @xcite have cast some doubt on that result , finding an eccentricity of 0.19 .",
    "initially , the goal of this project was to monitor stochastic short - term absorption features in cv ser s light curve involving light from the orbiting o star in order to try and link them to clumps in the wr wind . because of its high sensitivity , the most space telescope seemed like the perfect instrument to carry out this research .",
    "the system was observed in 2009 for more than a complete orbital cycle , since the anticipated absorption associated with the clumps should vary with the orbital phase , depending on the part of the wr wind illuminated by the o star along the line of sight ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "if the clumps produce observable absorption throughout the orbit , one would expect to find shorter and deeper variations near @xmath5 ( wr at inferior conjunction ) and almost no random variations ( unless one of the stars undergoes intrinsic variability ) around @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , the scatter of the residuals from a given light curve fit should vary with phase , being larger around @xmath5 .",
    "these variations would be a few mmag deep , as expected from the typical relative density enhancement in clumps .",
    "section  [ sec : obs ] will briefly summarize the observations ( both photometric and spectroscopic ) of cv ser taken for this study .",
    "the specific results for each observing run are presented in section  [ sec : anal ] , and then are briefly discussed in section  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "two photometry runs ( 2009 and 2010 ) were carried out using the most space telescope @xcite , a 150-mm aperture rumak - maksutov telescope with , initially , 2 ccds ( 1 for science and 1 for tracking ; however , the tracking ccd was lost in 2007 after being hit by a cosmic ray and tracking and science images are now both obtained on the same ccd ) on a polar , sun - synchronous , low - earth 101-minute orbit .",
    "most is used for optical photometry , with a wideband filter ( 3000  , centered around 5250  ) .",
    "the first run was obtained contiguously from 2009 june 27 to 2009 august 11 .",
    "this 45-day observation encompassed 2 eclipses of cv ser , with millimagnitude precision .",
    "most data points are 0.5 min apart , except when the satellite went over the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) .",
    "part of the run was also shared with another target , giving an overall somewhat inhomogeneously distributed data set .",
    "one particularity of this light curve is the difference of depth between both eclipses , which will be discussed in more detail in the next section .",
    "because of this interesting behavior , cv ser was observed once again with most the following year , from 2010 june 14 to 2010 july 11 , in similar conditions .",
    "however , this run covered only one eclipse of cv ser .",
    "spectroscopy was obtained at both observatoire du mont - mgantic ( 2009 and 2010 ) and the dominion astrophysical observatory ( 2009 only ) .",
    "details of these observations are summarized in table  [ tab : spectro ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     finally , one of the secondary aims of the spectroscopic part of this study was to confirm the spectral types of both orbital companions . in order to disentangle the spectra of both stars , the `` shift and add '' method described in @xcite was to be used .",
    "this method is iterative and uses the orbits to `` shift '' the spectra to the reference frame of the wr star .",
    "then , the spectra are `` co - added '' and the resulting compound spectrum is then shifted back to our reference frame to be subtracted from the initial spectra , revealing the spectra of the o star .",
    "after a few iterations , it is possible to get the spectrum of each star .",
    "since the orbit of the o star was not obtained in this study , we used the orbit found in a previous study with similar ephemeris @xcite .",
    "the method was applied over 10 iterations . however , the obtained o spectrum is heavily contaminated by artefacts due to the strong wr emission lines",
    ". this may be partly due to a slightly wrong orbital solution . in any case",
    ", it is impossible to confirm the spectral classification of the o companion based on these results .",
    "however , the wr spectrum does confirm the previous wc8d classification ( the ` d ' denotes the detection of dust in the ir ) , since it corresponds to the features found in @xcite . in particular , the civ @xmath75808/ciii @xmath75696 peak flux ratio is about 0.7 , which lies well within the 0.5 - 2.0 range associated with the wc8 spectral type ( this ratio goes up to @xmath8 if the excess emission produced in the wind collision zone is removed ) .",
    "it should also be mentioned that no attempt was made to detect the hypothetical cirs in the spectroscopic data , as the signal is complicated by the presence of excess emission from the wind collision zone .",
    "after having eliminated the other possible causes for the change in eclipse depth observed in the 2009 most photometry , the deduced 62% increase in @xmath1 over one 29.704d orbital period is a truly remarkable finding , unprecedented for wr stars . even more intriguing",
    "is the fact that the following year , the mass - loss rate had gone back to a lower value , suggesting that it may vary considerably over short to long timescales .",
    "the derived values of @xmath1 are also fairly low for a wr star . according to",
    ", variations in wind density should cause the spectral type to change , but this effect is not observed here , adding to the mystery , although these results are not necessarily incompatible since it is noted that the dependence on the wind density is weaker for late - type wc stars ( wc8 and wc9 ) . in any case , this definitely constitutes a challenge to both theorists and observers , since there is a dire need for a theoretical explanation as to what could drive such an impressive variation of the mass - loss rate , while constant monitoring would be required in order to get a better idea of the long - term behaviour of this parameter .",
    "one alternate explanation could conceivably be the presence of thin - shell instabilities in the wind collision zone .",
    "however , this will only affect the light curve dips stochastically , not systematically . in any case",
    ", it is not so much the details of the wind collision which determine the eclipse s shape and depth ; rather it is the global wind of the wr component in which the o star orbits .",
    "as for the primary goal of this study , it was not possible to systematically link the stochastic photometric variability to the clumping phenomenon .",
    "there was no clear phase dependence of the scatter of the light curves .",
    "the variability is then probably due to noise ( the combination of the unquantifiable absorption due to clumping and other stochastic phenomena ) , but also to cirs in the wr wind , as the analysis of the light curve residuals suggests .",
    "the repeated signature ( both in 2009 and 2010 ) offers a rather robust clue towards that hypothesis .",
    "this finding is very interesting in the actual context of cirs in wr stars , since more and more cir candidates are showing up ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . even though they have mainly been considered as an exception up until now",
    ", cirs in wr winds might just prove to be the rule after all .",
    "further studies will be necessary in order to find cyclical spectroscopic evidence supporting this possibility .",
    "however , their origin remains mysterious , especially since no magnetic fields have been detected in the extended atmospheres of wr stars yet .",
    "nevertheless , this scenario should not be ruled out since at the base of the winds , where the cirs originate , the magnetic field might have much higher values than our current detection limits but still is not detected simply because this region is obscured by the dense wind ( or perhaps due to cancellation in small dipole loops as seen on sunspots ) .",
    "non radial pulsations ( nrp ) or starspots have also been suggested as possible causes for this phenomenon @xcite .",
    "finally , what was initially thought to be a possible dust event during the 2010 observations can not conclusively be determined as statistically significant .",
    "however , the perceived asymmetry in the light curve is reminiscent of the model presented by .",
    "although this model was used to characterize the condensation of dust clouds and its effect on a light curve , and as such is very unlikely linked to these observations ( since such a dust event should create a much deeper dip in the light curve and the probability of it occurring exactly at the same time as the eclipse is rather low ) , it still gives way to a very important question : what role can dust play in cv ser s bizarre behaviour ?",
    "could a variation of the quantity of dust persistently produced by the wr star affect the light curve in the same way it has been inferred that a variation of the total mass - loss rate might ? in order for such an explanation to arise , one must first postulate that the dust distribution in the wind is the same as the free electron and hence overall density distribution , in order to preserve the system s geometrical properties and to reproduce the same eclipse profile found in the light curve . as to whether this assumption makes physical sense , it is hard to determine whether the dust could be produced ( or maintained ) following such a spatial distribution , since the production of dust in late wc stars is not yet well understood .",
    "however , it is fairly straightforward to calculate what quantity of dust would be needed to produce a similar effect to that of an increased mass - loss rate on the light curve .",
    "assuming mie scattering , we get a cross - section , for one grain of average radius @xmath9 , of @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the cross - section efficiency . choosing @xmath9 to be @xmath12 @xmath13 m ( as in wr140 : @xcite ) , we find that @xmath14 for wavelengths of the order of 5000  , giving a value of @xmath15 @xmath16 . however , using a density inside the dust grains of @xmath17 g/@xmath18 , we find that each grain is composed of roughly @xmath19 carbon atoms .",
    "since the most common carbon ion in the wr wind is ciii , for each atom of carbon we should expect to find 2 free electrons .",
    "then , the thomson cross - section of the number of free electrons needed to combine with @xmath19 carbon atoms to produce one grain is @xmath20 @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , scattering by the equivalent quantity of recombined carbon in the form of a dust grain is about @xmath21 times more efficient , therefore an appreciable increase in the depth of the eclipse could be caused by recombination of a negligibly small quantity of carbon and its condensation in the form of dust .",
    "possible support for this is seen in the ubv light curve of cv ser obtained from 1984 to 1994 by dzhapiashvili ( anthokhin , priv . com . )",
    "in which the eclipse depth varies strongly with wavelength .",
    "therefore , if dust plays any role in these varying eclipse depths , the 62% value for the increase of @xmath1 over an orbital period in the 2009 data obtained in this study should probably be considered as an upper limit .",
    "unfortunately , not much more can be deduced about the production of dust in cv ser , except that it remains a very interesting phenomenon and should be further studied . indeed ,",
    "with its troubled history and intriguing behaviour , cv ser might prove to be a key system for understanding the production of dust in wc+o binaries .",
    "it does not appear clear whether this process is necessarily due to the wind collision zone or if it originates in wind shocks and is then intrinsic to the wr component .    in conclusion , this work possibly raises more questions than it answers , but we conclude without a doubt that cv ser is a very important system that might hold the answer to old problems .",
    "hopefully , our findings will motivate the community to take a deeper look into this remarkable object in the years to come .",
