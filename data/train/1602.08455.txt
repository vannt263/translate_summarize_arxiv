    "in traditional data networks such as internet , there are usually some assumptions of the network model e.g. the existence of at least one end - to - end path between source - destination pair @xcite .",
    "any arbitrary link connecting two nodes is assumed to be bidirectional supporting symmetric data rates with low error probability and latency @xcite .",
    "messages are buffered in intermediate nodes ( e.g. routers ) and further forwarded to the next - hop relay or successfully received by the destination . in this case , each message is not expected to occupy the buffer of nodes for a long period of time .",
    "however , these all above usually fail in the context of delay tolerant networks ( dtns)@xcite . some applications , e.g. , email service , address the delivery success while having relatively flexible requirement of latency , which is known as  delay - tolerant \" . for further popularizing these kind of applications",
    ", we have to reconsider the widely used network architecture so as to relax the assumption of the continuous end - to - end connectivity that tcp / ip based @xcite .",
    "recently years there have seen the wide adoptions of mobile devices such as smartphones , laptops and tablet pcs .",
    "the mobile devices may form a network in an ad hoc manner , to work as an auxiliary to cellular networks for some services such as social information sharing .",
    "many researchers use the term `` social delay tolerant networks ( sdtns ) '' to describe this special kind of dtn , where mobile users move around and communicate with each other via their carried short - distance wireless communication devices @xcite . since sdtns experience intermittent connectivity incurred by the mobility of users , routing is still the most challenging problem @xcite for such networks .",
    "the fundamental characteristics of stdn is that there exist potential social relationships behind the nodes in the network , which in turn affects the movement pattern of nodes .",
    "many previous works have explored how to leverage the social relationships so as to enhance the routing performance .",
    "for example , social - aware routing algorithms based on social network analysis have been proposed , such as bubble rap @xcite , simbet @xcite . besides , algorithms that based on some custom defined social metrics are proposed in @xcite .    in many real sdtns , mobile users that have a common interest",
    "generally will visit some locations that are related to this interest .",
    "previous works observed that 50% of mobile users in this network spent 74.0% of their time at a single access point ( ap ) to show the characteristic of frequently visiting a few locations @xcite .",
    "this indicates the feasibility to `` connect '' some nodes through their commonly visited locations where some cache devices are deployed for buffering the message , e.g. throwbox proposed in @xcite .",
    "cache devices have several advantages over ordinary nodes .",
    "first , there would usually be some stable connections between nodes and the cache device @xcite , which hardly exist between two ordinary nodes due to their mobility .",
    "second , they are fixed as a kind of network infrastructures , and their capacity can be much more sufficient than the ordinary nodes . from the above discussion , intuitively we can deploy cache devices in frequently visited locations to improve the routing performance in sdtns .    in this paper , we focus on the multi - copy unicast routing problem in sdtns , where there is one source - destination nodes pair for each packet , and there can be multiple replicas of the packet in the network .",
    "different from previous works that based on classical social network analysis or custom defined social metrics , our scheme makes use of the movement records collected by nodes .",
    "the basic idea is to view the set of nodes holding a packet or its replicas as an entirety , thus extracting its frequently visited locations from the movement records .",
    "the frequently visited locations of the destination node is obtained in the same way .",
    "then we get the intersection between the two locations sets and then derive the co - delivery probability for the whole relay node set .",
    "our goal is to calculate the optimal nodes set that maximizes the co - delivery probability .",
    "in addition , since that each generated message is only valid before reaching its deadline , we take the message time - to - live value into consideration when extracting the movement pattern from the movement records . under this model , we propose the movement pattern - aware optimal routing ( mpar ) for sdtns .",
    "we adopt the optimal opportunistic routing scheme by maintaining an optimal node set for the destination node . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first work to exploit the social - aware routing algorithm that leverages the movement pattern of a group of nodes .",
    "our main contributions are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we present a periodical time - aware movement record model and extract the movement pattern from the movement record of nodes .",
    "each node set is viewed as an entirety during the whole routing process .",
    "corresponding movement pattern can be extracted from the same set in different time intervals .",
    "the frequently visited locations are directly corresponding to the movement pattern for each node(s ) set .",
    "2 .   under our network model that cache devices are deployed in several positions , we analyze two key performance metrics , based on which the routing problem is formally proved to be an @xmath0 combinatorial optimization problem .",
    "two search algorithms are proposed to solve the optimization problem , which are respectively based on the local search scheme and the tabu search scheme .",
    "the key elements of the tabu search scheme are specifically defined for our optimal set search problem .",
    "two respective movement pattern - aware routing schemes are designed based on the local search algorithm and the tabu search algorithm , which is called local - mpar and tabu - mpar and are respectively corresponding to the reactive routing strategy and the proactive routing strategy .",
    "tabu - mpar is proved able to guide the relay node(s ) set in evolving to the optimal one .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : preliminaries ] we introduce the system model . in section [ sec : overview ] we analyze some key properties behind the routing , and model the routing as an optimal search problem . we discuss the computational hardness of this problem and propose a heuristic method to approximately obtain the optimal solution in section [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "the details about the routing algorithm are given in section [ sec : routing ] .",
    "section  [ sec : simulation ] analyses the simulation result .",
    "we conclude the paper in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the proofs of theorem 1 and 2 are presented in the appendix .",
    "in this section , we give the system model and the assumptions behind our scheme .",
    "we consider a sdtn composed of @xmath1 nodes @xmath2 moving among @xmath3 locations @xmath4 .",
    "each mobile node frequently visits some locations @xmath5 .",
    "this model is derived from the case of real mobile networks .",
    "a typical example is the wi - fi campus network at dartmouth college .",
    "another sdtn that follows this characteristic is the vehicular ad - hoc networks ( vanets ) , where lots of buses and taxies move among bus stations and taxi stops . like in the previous work @xcite",
    ", we assume that the behavior of each node @xmath6 visiting any location @xmath7 follows the poisson process .",
    "in other words , the time interval that each node visits a location follows an exponential distribution . besides",
    ", each location in our model is assumed to have a throwbox@xcite to store and transmit messages .",
    "and we assume that the capacity of the throwbox is sufficient enough to take custody of messages .",
    "we assume that each message has a time - to - live value @xmath8 , indicating the remaining life time of the message . with the time passing ,",
    "@xmath8 gradually decreases , and when @xmath8 is zero , the message is deleted from nodes buffer .",
    "this time - to - live field prevents a message from staying in the network for a very long time , and allows the application to assign a deadline for the message . for applications such as news dissemination or advertising publishing ,",
    "the message is only valid before its deadline .",
    "when the message reaches the deadline , there is no need to continue buffering the message .      as a large number of mobile devices",
    "are carried by human - beings or relative to the society of people , we assume that the movement patterns of nodes are of periodicity .",
    "for example , smith goes to work on monday to friday , so that his frequently visited locations might be composed of home , office , some bus - stations and a few nosheries . on the weekends",
    ", he usually goes to a club or some coffee bars , or other places different from those visited on workdays .",
    "however , his actions usually repeat per week , i.e. , there exists some periodicity for his movement records . from this point",
    ", we assume the period time is @xmath9 .",
    "normally , the length of @xmath9 will be several days",
    ". then we divide @xmath9 into @xmath10 slots .",
    "the length of each slot is thereby @xmath11 .",
    "we represent the time points sequence as @xmath12 , then any two time points @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xmath15 form a time interval @xmath16 $ ] , as shown in  [ fig : time_slots ] .",

    "before discussing the details of our routing scheme , let us overview the routing problem .",
    "we first discuss how to extract the movement pattern of a set of node(s ) in section [ sec : movement pattern ] .",
    "then we analyze some key properties behind the routing in section [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "finally , the routing problem is formally defined as an optimal search problem in section [ sec : formalization ] .",
    "the movement pattern is extracted from the records of node(s ) .",

    ".    for example , assume that we have a network case , that there are four nodes and two locations in total and @xmath47 is the destination node , and @xmath9 is divided into two time slots @xmath48 and @xmath49 , as shown in  [ fig : example1 ] .",

    "however if there is a neighborhood solution @xmath51 has the better evaluation function value than the current recorded best one , we absolve the corresponding tabu element and move the solution vector to @xmath51 .    the tabu search process of the example in  [ fig : example1 ] is shown in  [ tab : tabu_search ] .",
    "like the local process illustrated in  [ tab : example1 ] , the source node is @xmath52 and thus the initial solution is @xmath53 $ ] . for simplification , the tabu length @xmath54 constants at 3 rather than being randomly chosen .",
    "besides , the variable @xmath55 in definition  [ def : stop_rule ] of stop rule is set to be 3 .    in step 1 ,",
    "the tabu table @xmath50 is empty , so all the next options are choosable . according to line 5 in algorithm  [ alg : framework ]",
    ", we choose the solution vector @xmath56 $ ] that has the maximal evaluation function value . in step 2 ,",
    "the first position of the solution vector is tabued , so the next solution vector can be chosen only between @xmath57 $ ] and @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "the search procedure continues until it reaches step 5 , where the best recorded solution has not changed after @xmath59 steps , so the tabu search procedure stops .",
    "overview the whole process , we can quickly go through the solution space and jump out of the trap of local optimum , which can not be achieved by the local search algorithm in  [ tab : local_search ] .",
    "[ tab : tabu_search ]",
    "in this section , we give the details about the routing process .",
    "we implement two routing protocols , local - mpar and tabu - mpar , based on two search algorithms , the local search algorithm and the tabu search algorithm respectively . in local - mpar , the other node(s ) s @xmath60 value for any one node is required when they encounter , while in tabu - mpar , we assume that each node knows the @xmath60 values of all other node(s ) in advance .    in this paper , we investigate the routing process for a single message ( it may have one or more than one replicas ) . to illustrate this further",
    ", we refer to the concept in epidemic routing protocol @xcite that treats the message as virus .",
    "then a successful message replication operation can be viewed as an infection process .",
    "the delivery operation is excluded in our discussion , i.e. , when we say @xmath61 infects @xmath62 , @xmath62 is not the destination node .",
    "start from this point , we can classify all the nodes in the network into three kinds .",
    "* _ infected node . _",
    "an infected node is a node holding the message or any of its replicas .",
    "however an infected node can not infect other pure nodes . *",
    "_ pure node . _",
    "a pure node is a node not holding the message or any of its replicas .",
    "it can be infected by any infectious node .",
    "* _ infectious node . _",
    "an infectious node is a special kind of infected node that is able to infect other pure nodes .",
    "an _ infectious _ state is able to move to an _ infected _ state , which means that it still holds the message but unable to add new ones to the network .",
    "pure _ state can also be transferred to an _ infected _ state or infectious state , which means that it receives the message .",
    "we further explain these states by referring to epidemic @xcite and sprayandwait @xcite protocols .    in epidemic routing",
    ", there are only two kinds of nodes , _ pure node _ and _ infectious node_. the replicas distribution process ends when all the pure nodes are infected and become infectious nodes .",
    "sprayandwait routing employs all the three kinds of nodes . in its source edition",
    ", there is only one infectious node in the network , while in its binary edition the infectious nodes can be multiple but limited in a fixed number .",
    "the replicas distribution process ends when there is no infectious node in the network .    actually ,",
    "these three kinds of node exist in all kinds of routing protocols in mobile delay tolerant networks . specifically , epidemic and sprayandwait",
    "are two most representative zero - knowledge based routing protocols .",
    "all other replicas distribution process in any routing protocol can more or less be viewed as the improvement of these two basic schemes , by letting the node state transfers among _ pure _ , _ infected _ and _ infectious_. before introducing the local - mpar and tabu - mpar , we propose three postulations about the routing .",
    "[ post : replication ] any node @xmath61 replicates the message to @xmath62 only if @xmath62 currently does not hold any of its replicas .    [ post : deletion ] the operation of cleaning messages out of the buffer caused by time - to - live deadline or buffer size constraint is called `` drop '' , while that caused by state transition is called `` deletion '' .",
    "the set of nodes holding the message or any of its replicas is denoted by @xmath42 , which is compose of all infectious nodes and infected nodes .",
    "then we have the following theorem .    [ theorem : replication_deletion ] the replication operation is corresponding to the transition from w to g and deletion operation to the transition from g to w.    from the definition of the three states , a node holding the message can be either in state b or g , and a node not holding the message is accurately corresponding to state w. since that there is no direct transition between b and w , a node in state b transfers to w has to pass the state g , and vise versa .",
    "then from postulation  1 , the replication operation is corresponding to the transition from w to b or w to t , i.e. w to g. from postulation  2 , the deletion operation is corresponding to the transition from b to w or g to w , i.e. g to w.      in local - mpar algorithm , each node could be of all the three states . however , we only allow not more than 1 _ infectious _ node exists for each generated message .",
    "the basic idea of local - mpar is to dynamically adjust the set @xmath42 that includes all nodes holding the message , so as to maximize the co - delivery probability @xmath63 .",
    "algorithm  [ alg : local - mpar ] shows the local - mpar process .",
    "there are three stages in local - mpar . in the initial stage ,",
    "the source node @xmath64 generates a message @xmath65 , and then set its state to be infectious .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath42 is initialized to be composed of only @xmath64 . for the node set @xmath42 , we have the following postulation .",
    "[ post : n ] in local - mpar , the node set @xmath42 is always maintained by the active node .",
    "the whole routing process can be viewed as the dynamical adjustment of the node set @xmath42 , as shown in the second stage .",

    "we name the table position in row b column g as bg , by parity of reasoning .",
    "we can see from  [ tab : local - mpar ] that the state transition happens only if either @xmath61 or @xmath62 is in infectious state , i.e. state b. there is nothing in bb because that it can not be true that both @xmath61 and @xmath62 are in infectious state in local - mpar .        [",

    "lemma  1 directly shows that any happened replication or deletion operation can be informed to the infectious node immediately , so that @xmath42 would be updated in time . either a replication or deletion operation just causes 1 replicas difference in the network , thus only adding or removing one element in the set @xmath42 , which indeed transfers the correspondent solution vector to one of its neighborhoods @xmath67 .",
    "we can see from  4 that n would not vary if and only if @xmath68 , i.e. , if and only if the solution reaches the local optimum .",
    "there still remains one question .",
    "since there is only one infectious node in local - mpar , how should we choose the infectious node ?",
    "the basic principle is to choose the node with the smallest expected delay to arrive at another frequently visited location , i.e. @xmath69 $ ] in equation  [ eq : delay ] . in  [ tab : local - mpar ] gb , when there is no need to change @xmath61 from g to w , we should consider that whether to change @xmath61 to be the infectious node .",
    "if @xmath70 $ ] is less than @xmath71 $ ] , then we deem that @xmath61 is more suitable to be the message duplicator , because it is expected to visit other location(s ) sooner , which means more transmission opportunities .",
    "conversely , if the duplicator responsibility moves to @xmath62 , i.e. g@xmath72b happens in @xmath62 , we should symmetrically have b@xmath72 g happens in @xmath61 to keep the uniqueness property of the infectious node , as shown in  [ tab : local - mpar ] bg .",

    "there is two main differences compared to local - mpar .",
    "first , there is no need to update the node set @xmath78 in other node , since that it had been computed in the source node @xmath64 before and added to the message head .",
    "second , when any two nodes @xmath61 and @xmath62 encounter , we reallocate the tickets before start the state transition process .",

    "the working time for each simulation day constants at 8 simulation hours for each person .",
    "each person s probability to do evening activity is set to be 0.5 .",
    "besides , we set the probability of owning a car for each person to be 0.2 , so people might drive themselves to these places instead of taking public vehicles .",
    "the walking speed of pedestrians is set to be 0.81.4 m / s . as shown in  [ fig : manhattan ] , there are three kinds of locations in the simulation , i.e. home , office and meeting spot . there is a loop line for buses in the center of the entire manhattan square , so the pedestrians can take a bus to reach their destinations .",
    "we put a throw box in every home , office and meeting spot .",
    "the capacity of each throwbox is set to be sufficient enough to take custody of all received messages .",
    "all the nodes communicate with the bluetooth interface , of which the transmit diameter is 10 m and the transmit speed is 250kb / s . since that each spot ( home , office and meeting spot ) is set to be a point in the map ,",
    "if a node reach the spot , it is ensured to encounter with the throwbox so as to have its messages taken custody .",
    "we compare the mpar algorithm with the existing social - aware algorithms : delegation forwarding ( df ) @xcite and simbet routing @xcite .",
    "four performance metrics commonly used are examined : delivery ratio , average latency overhead ratio and average hop count .",
    "simulation results demonstrate that the mpar algorithm can significantly improve sdtns routing performance .      in the simulations ,",
    "30,000 messages are generated by randomly selecting source and destination nodes among all the pedestrians .",
    "the size of each message is between 500k and 1 m . in simulations on evaluating the four metrics , we set @xmath104=200 , 400 , 600 and 800 , respectively .",
    "the simulation area is adjusted according to @xmath104 to keep the connectivity of the network .",
    "the entire simulation time is set to be 12 days .      in the simulation of varying the time - to - live value",
    ", we set the buffer size constant at 200 m .",
    "the time - to - live value is set from 10 to 30 hours .",
    "the simulation results are shown in  [ fig : delivery_ttl ] , [ fig : latency_ttl ] , [ fig : overhead_ttl ] and [ fig : hop_ttl ] .",
    "these results show that the two mpar algorithms significantly outperform df and simbet .",
    "compared with df , tabu - mpar and local - mpar increase the delivery ratio by about 71.1% and 37.8% , and reduces the average latency by approximate 79.2% and 60.1% , respectively .",
    "compared with simbet , tabu - mpar and local - mpar increase the delivery ratio by about 95.2% and 55.3% , and reduces the average latency by about 50% and 70% . regarding the results in  [ fig : overhead_ttl ] , both tabu - mpar and local - mpar have a comparably lower overhead ratio than df and simbet . for the three social - aware routing algorithm tabu - mpar , local - mpar and simbet ,",
    "the overhead performance is much better than df , especially when the message ttl is set to be relatively large . when the number of nodes is smaller , the improvement is a little more apparent .",
    "since that the mpar routing algorithms constrain the maximal number of replicas and utilize the throwbox to deliver messages , the number of relay operations is very low .",
    "moreover , along with the increasing of nodes , the overloads for each node is released , so the overhead ratio becomes lower .",
    "[ fig : hop_ttl ] shows the average hop count performance .",
    "we can see that the two mpar algorithms have smaller average hop count than the other two ones . with the number of nodes increasing , the average hop count increases .",
    "this is because the simulation area is correspondingly magnified and it needs more nodes to cooperate to delivery each message .      in the simulation of varying the buffer size",
    ", we set the message time - to - live constant at 16 simulation hours .",
    "the buffer size is set from 50 to 300 mb .",
    "the simulation results are shown in  [ fig : delivery_buffer ] , [ fig : latency_buffer ] , [ fig : overhead_buffer ] and [ fig : hop_buffer ] .",
    "we can see from the results that the two mpar algorithms significantly outperform df and simbet .",
    "compared with df , tabu - mpar and local - mpar increase the delivery ratio by about 83.8% and 40.3% , and reduces the average latency by about 83.8% and 57.8% , respectively .",
    "compared with simbet , tabu - mpar and local - mpar increase the delivery ratio by nearly 3 and 2.5 times , and reduces the average latency by about 80% and 60% .",
    "regarding the results in  [ fig : overhead_buffer],tabu - mpar and local - mpar have almost the same overhead ratio , which is a little bit lower than simbet and is much lower than df when the buffer size is smaller than 120 m .",
    "when there are only a few nodes in a relatively small area , the improvement of the overhead ratio of the social - aware routing schemes is more obvious , as shown in  [ fig : overhead_buffer ] . the same as the results in the simulation of varying ttl , we can see from  [ fig : hop_buffer ] that the two mpar algorithms have smaller average hop count than the other two ones . with the number of nodes increasing , the average hop count increases .",
    "the reason is as same as in section 6.3.1 that the simulation area is correspondingly magnified and it needs more nodes to cooperate to delivery each message .",
    "in this paper , we proposed a movement pattern - aware routing protocol mpar for sdtns .",
    "we present a periodical time - aware movement record model and extract the movement pattern from the movement record of nodes , and then each node set is viewed as an entirety during the whole routing process .",
    "two key properties for routing are analyzed and consequently the routing problem is modeled to be a combinatorial optimal search problem .",
    "two search algorithms are proposed to solve the optimization problem , which are respectively based on the local search scheme and the tabu search scheme .",
    "two respective movement pattern - aware routing schemes are designed based on the local search algorithm and the tabu search algorithm , which is called local - mpar and tabu - mpar and are respectively . in addition , we prove that the tabu - mpar can guide the relay node(s ) set in evolving to the optimal one .",
    "we demonstrate how the mpar algorithm significantly outperforms the previous ones through extensive simulations , based on the synthetic sdtn mobility model .",
