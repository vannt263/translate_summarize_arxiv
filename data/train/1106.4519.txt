    "both major contending theories of planet formation , core accretion and gravitational instability , require collection of solid material into a dense mid - plane layer within circumstellar disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "to understand this first stage in the generation of planetary embryos we must determine the necessary conditions for grain sedimentation and if the relevant physical processes act uniformly with particle size . numerical simulations incorporating gas drag and stellar gravity predict that larger grains are expected to settle into the disk mid - plane more efficiently than smaller grains ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , these simulations predict extremely short timescales for the growth and migration of dust particles that are inconsistent with observations , suggesting that some additional disk physics needs to be included ( see @xcite ) .",
    "observational results , and modeling thereof ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have begun to lay the foundation for grain sedimentation and its relation to grain growth , providing evidence in support of larger grains being more concentrated towards the disk mid - plane . although these works hint that grain growth , radial migration , and sedimentation are intimately connected , observations that resolve the spatial distribution of large grains are necessary to complete this picture .",
    "study of the largest dust grains and their spatial distribution requires observations at long wavelengths ( commensurate with grain size ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "unambiguous grain vertical distribution information can only come from protoplanetary disks which are edge - on to our line of sight ( section [ secsamp ] ) .",
    "edge - on protoplanetary disk systems imaged in scattered light typically subtend @xmath10.3 - 3@xmath2 in the vertical direction ( see table [ tabtargets ] references ) .",
    "to identify vertical grain stratification , thermal emission from disk atmosphere grains must be separated from that of grains settled to the disk mid - plane with high angular resolution observations .",
    "hence , to study the vertical distribution of large grains , one must map edge - on disk systems with a long - baseline radio interferometer such as the nrao expanded very large array ( evla ; @xcite ) .    in this contribution",
    "we present an evla survey of edge - on protoplanetary disk systems .",
    "target selection and observations are discussed , and first results on the source iras04368 + 2557 are reported .",
    "edge - on disks are selected because of their favorable geometry : each beam of an edge - on disk map samples a single disk altitude . from spectral index maps of edge - on disk systems",
    "we will measure the maximum grain size per synthesized beam and hence the vertical distribution of grains as a function of grain size .",
    "some assumptions regarding disk axisymmetry may be necessary to delineate optical depth effects from true grain size variation , especially near the disk mid - plane ( see also discussion in section [ secgg ] ) .",
    "we arbitrarily restrict our sample to disks with inclination angle @xmath375@xmath4 ( where 0@xmath4 is face - on to our line of sight ) to limit confusion between radial and altitude flux variations .",
    "all sources in our sample have been selected based on the existence of scattered light images that allow a determination of the disk inclination to a few degrees .",
    "ultimately , such a sample will enable more powerful global panchromatic analyses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "disk systems observed in the first evla observing cycle are listed in table [ tabtargets ] .",
    "preliminary observations aim to identify microwave - bright disks for future mapping and to characterize the overall degree of grain growth for each disk system based on measurement of their long - wavelength opacity index @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8@xmath9 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath5 provides information on the size of grains relative to the observing wavelength , where @xmath5@xmath101 indicates grains comparable to or larger than the observing wavelength ( e.g. , @xcite ; section [ secgg ] discusses how disk optical depth affects the determination of @xmath5 ) .",
    "these goals require total power measurements ( i.e. , unresolved disk measurements ) which are best done in compact array configurations .",
    "disk flux measurements are made at 7 and 13 mm .",
    "robust measurement of the opacity index @xmath5 requires removing emission from processes other than dust thermal emission .",
    "young stellar objects are known to emit in the microwave due to free - free emission from ionized jets and disk - winds and gyrosynchrotron emission from coronal processes ( see e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "previous works have shown that free - free and gyrosynchrotron emission ( hereafter non - disk emission ) can contaminate the 7 - 13 mm wavelength region at a level that is anywhere from 0 - 100% of the detected flux ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is assumed that measurements longward of 20 mm are probing only non - disk emission ( this is not always the case ; see @xcite ) .",
    "we perform observations at both 35 and 60 mm so that there are two data points with which to determine the spectral slope of non - disk emission components .",
    "non - disk emission is known to be variable ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". proper removal of this variable emission requires observations of the non - disk component that are as close in time as possible to observations of the disk component . to obtain quasi - simultaneous observations across all bands",
    ", we intertwined scans at 7 , 13 , 35 , and 60 mm within a continuous observing block ( which can span 3 - 5 hours ; see table [ tab04368 ] ) .",
    "although these disk and non - disk measurements are not perfectly simultaneous , the assumption is that averaging 35 and 60 mm scans taken over the entire observing block will yield an accurate measurement of the non - disk emission component during 7 and 13 mm scans .",
    "we test this strategy in section [ secvar ] .",
    "of the 11 sources observed in the first evla cycle , 9 were detected ( table [ tabtargets ] ) . in this section observations of iras04368 + 2557 ( l1527irs ) are presented as a case study of the methodologies outlined above .",
    "iras04368 + 2557 is an embedded class 0 object in the l1527 dark cloud in taurus @xcite .",
    "although optically faint ( e.g. , @xcite ) , iras04368 + 2557 is bright in the sub - millimeter @xcite , millimeter @xcite , and microwave @xcite .",
    "millimeter and sub - millimeter results to date show that iras04368 + 2557 is composed of a substantial envelope that is infalling onto the central source @xcite .",
    "vla imaging detects jet emission emanating from the central protostar @xcite and provides evidence of a @xmath124au binary companion @xcite .",
    "the disk surrounding the central source is probed most recently by @xcite who present 3.78@xmath11 m imaging that resolves the inner envelope and disk structure of iras04368 + 2557 .",
    "the only unambiguous detection of disk thermal emission comes from @xcite who resolve the disk at 7 mm .",
    "our observations provide the first nearly simultaneous , multiband , compact configuration radio frequency observations of iras04368 + 2557 .",
    "iras04368 + 2557 was observed with all 27 evla antennas .",
    "some details of the observations are given in table [ tab04368 ] .",
    "the widar correlator was set up with two 128mhz sub - bands centered on the frequencies listed in table [ tab04368 ] .",
    "each sub - band had 4 polarization products ( rr , ll , rl , lr ) and sixty - four 2000khz channels . observations at 7 and 13 mm were performed in `` fast - switching '' mode ; target source scans were interleaved with frequent visits to a nearby calibration source to freeze out rapid atmospheric phase fluctuations .",
    "cycle times of 2 and 4 minutes were used for 7 and 13 mm , respectively .",
    "the primary calibration source 3c286 was used to measure the complex bandpass and to set the absolute flux scale .    to probe the stability of the non - disk emission component over long and short time",
    "baselines we retrieved vla archival 35 mm observations of iras04368 + 2557 ( see table 2 ) . to maintain homogeneity in this data set we only use observations performed with all vla antennas .",
    "vla observations were made in both circular polarizations with an effective bandwidth of 92mhz centered at a frequency of 8.46ghz .",
    "data from ar0350 and ar0465 are presented in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "all other data are unpublished to the best of our knowledge .",
    "while our reductions agree well with those of @xcite , we find a significantly lower flux density for iras04368 + 2557 than do @xcite .",
    "further investigation shows that our measurement is consistent with what is displayed in figure 2 of @xcite , but that this and our measurement are both inconsistent with what is listed in their table 2 .",
    "all data are reduced using the astronomical image processing software ( aips ; @xcite ) .",
    "vla data are edited and calibrated following standard vla data reduction procedures .",
    "evla data are edited and calibrated in a similar manner , except for the addition of first pass fringe fitting to set the interferometer delays ( performed on the primary calibrator , 3c286 ) and bandpass calibration .",
    "standard high - frequency reduction techniques are employed for 7 mm data .",
    "iras04368 + 2557 is detected at all observed frequencies with @xmath310@xmath12 significance .",
    "we assume absolute flux density scale systematic uncertainties of 15% and 5% for 7 and 13 mm , respectively ; these are included in the table [ tab04368 ] uncertainties .",
    "absolute flux densities for 35 and 60 mm are assumed to be limited by the rms noise level in cleaned maps .",
    "figure [ figcntrs ] shows contour maps from the evla data ; iras04368 + 2557 is not resolved in any of the evla images .",
    "figure [ figvar ] presents 35 mm measurements of iras04368 + 2557 from each epoch listed in table [ tab04368 ] .",
    "inter - epoch measurements are made by imaging all data obtained in the time interval listed for that epoch .",
    "intra - epoch measurements are made by imaging the smallest time interval that yields an @xmath010@xmath12 detection of iras04368 + 2557 .    except for the 2002 data , no significant ( @xmath133@xmath12 ) inter - epoch variability is detected .",
    "the 2002 observations were done with the most extended array configuration and emission structures could have been resolved out by the widely separated baselines resulting in lower than average flux densities .",
    "intra - epoch measurements reveal two transient events .",
    "the first is a mini - flare observed near the end of the 26 minute long ut 1997 aug 14 scan .",
    "the second is the radio jet detected by @xcite which appears only near the end of the ut 2002 feb 08 data set .",
    "out of eighteen @xmath025 minute long 35 mm iras04368 + 2557 sequences , one exhibits a flare event and one exhibits a jet event .",
    "the occurrence rate of such events in 25 minute windows is @xmath16% if the events are unique and @xmath111% if they are the same phenomenon .",
    "compared to previous studies of young stellar object centimetric variability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the results presented herein appear to agree best with the @xcite study of short and long term variability in six young stellar objects . at a wavelength of 60 mm",
    "they find that 4 out of 6 young stellar objects show short term variability and that 3 out of 6 objects show long term variability ( the positive variability detections are not necessarily from the same objects in each group ) .",
    "hence , their results suggest that young stellar objects appear to be just as likely to have short term variability as they are to exhibit long term variability .",
    "such conclusions seem to contradict the results of @xcite and @xcite , where it is found that there are generally lower levels of variability on shorter timescales .",
    "however , of the above mentioned studies , only @xcite analyze variability on intra - epoch ( less than day ) timescales .",
    "it could be the case that even seemingly stable sources have sporadic variability that can only be probed on the shortest timescales . if the event occurrence rate derived above for iras04368 + 2557 is representative of stars in the same class , then such sources might exhibit short - duration flares in as many as one out of ten 25 minute observing windows .",
    "however , since less than ten sources have been probed on intra - epoch timescales , it is likely premature to extend their results to other sources .",
    "monitoring similar to that presented here and in @xcite of new and previously studied young stellar objects can further address variability timescales and strength in a more statistical sense .",
    "for weak flare events like those detected here , averaging over the duration of an observing block sufficiently suppresses the flare effect .",
    "stronger flares can likely be identified by analyzing all data in a time - series fashion .",
    "no strong flares are present in the evla data .",
    "figure [ fig04368sed ] shows the evla flux measurements of iras04368 + 2557 with literature measurements at millimeter and sub - millimeter wavelengths .",
    "the 450 and 850@xmath11 m measurements @xcite were made with beam sizes of 9 and 15@xmath2 , respectively , while the 1.3 mm measurement @xcite was made with a beam size of 11@xmath2 .",
    "the 2.7 mm measurement @xcite was made with a synthesized beam size of 6@xmath2 @xmath14 4.9@xmath2 ( pa + 163@xmath4 ) .",
    "the non - disk emission component is fit with @xmath15@xmath16@xmath17@xmath18 ( where @xmath15 is the spectral index f@xmath19 @xmath7 @xmath8@xmath20 ) , consistent with non - disk indices assumed by @xcite .",
    "an extrapolation of the non - disk emission fit is subtracted from 7 and 13 mm measurements ; uncertainties of each flux measurement and the spectral index are propagated into the corrected flux uncertainties .",
    "we calculate for iras04368 + 2557 @xmath15@xmath21@xmath171.93@xmath220.25 and @xmath15@xmath23@xmath172.87@xmath220.17 using the corrected 7 mm flux density .",
    "we use different spectral indices for wavelengths @xmath101 mm and @xmath31 mm since single power - law fits to all sub - millimeter and millimeter data points are discrepant with the 450@xmath11 m flux measurement at the @xmath05@xmath12 level .",
    "the spectral index from 450@xmath11 m to 1.3 mm is consistent with rayleigh - jeans emission suggesting that the disk is opaque at these wavelengths .",
    "in the case of the 450@xmath11 m to 2.7 mm measurements , there is likely contamination from extended envelope structure detected around iras04368 + 2557 ( see below and * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . if these measurements are contaminated by envelope emission , then the disk - only @xmath15@xmath23 is smaller ( flatter ) than the value quoted above .",
    "it is noted that the evla 7 mm flux measurement is roughly consistent with the total flux density estimated for the resolved structures detected by @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the disk structure is fairly compact ( relative to the envelope structure ) , in agreement with scattered light images presented by @xcite .",
    "iras04368 + 2557 is resolved at wavelengths shorter than 7 mm with beam sizes larger than the evla 7 mm synthesized beam implying that those flux measurements include envelope emission .",
    "synthesis of the above suggests that accurate measurement of grain growth from spectral indices requires data sets having beam sizes comparable to the disk angular size when contaminating sources are present .    extracting an opacity index @xmath5 from the above measured @xmath15@xmath23",
    "is complicated not only by envelope contamination but also by edge - on disk geometry .",
    "when calculating @xmath5 one must account for optically thick inner disk emission sampled by the flux measurements .",
    "should no optically thick emission be present , then @xmath5 is simply @xmath15@xmath23@xmath242 . in the case",
    "that optically thick emission is present in the measurements , @xmath5 takes the form of @xmath25(@xmath26@xmath242 ) where @xmath27 is the ratio of optically thick to optically thin emission @xcite .",
    "as discussed above , the disk orbiting iras04368 + 2557 appears to be completely opaque out to wavelengths as long as @xmath11 mm .",
    "thus , significant optically thick emission may be present even at wavelengths near 10 mm .",
    "estimates of @xmath27 are typically made assuming some disk mass density profile and by measuring the temperature profile from spectral indices and disk flux levels in the optically thick wavelength regime @xcite .",
    "however , equation 10 of @xcite shows that mapping spectral indices and disk flux levels into temperature profiles is confounded when disks are nearly edge - on .",
    "modeling of edge - on disk spectral energy distributions and resolved images can recover their true disk temperature profiles .",
    "due to this additional modeling and envelope contamination uncertainties , we leave derivation of the opacity index for the iras04368 + 2557 disk to future works .",
    "the 13 mm measurement appears to fall short of the @xmath8@xmath28 fit after being corrected for non - disk emission .",
    "this flux deficit suggests a break in the disk emission spectral index from 7 to 13 mm , but is marginally significant .",
    "if envelope contamination is present as discussed above , then its removal would increase the significance of the deficient corrected 13 mm measurement .",
    "comparison to other protoplanetary disk systems shows that such a break would be unusual ( e.g. , @xcite ) and suggestive of a cut - off near pebble - sizes in the disk grain size distribution .",
    "if these characteristics of iras04368 + 2557 are confirmed , then there may be a connection between its potential @xmath124au binary companion ( @xcite ) , its apparent 7 mm outer disk truncation @xcite , and its possible lack of large disk grains .",
    "we are carrying out an expanded very large array program to map the vertical distribution of large grains in edge - on protoplanetary disks .",
    "the ultimate goal of this survey is to study grain growth and sedimentation as the first stages of planet formation .",
    "our compact array observational strategy aims to provide accurate disk thermal emission measurements in the microwave by sampling non - disk emission in concert with disk measurements .",
    "first evla results for iras04368 + 2557 show that the protoplanetary disk around this source is likely optically thick out to millimeter wavelengths and that it may have a dearth of `` pebble - sized '' grains .",
