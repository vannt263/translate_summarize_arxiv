    "although the hydrodynamic large deviation theory does not predict the correct scaling of the current deviation , the analysis of section [ sec : vortices ] suggests that local current fluctuations are dominated by vortices .",
    "restarting at the microscopic level , the variance of the integrated current is computed for the ssep on a general graph ( section [ sec : general graph ] ) and explicit expressions are obtained for the current through a slit for the ssep on a two - dimensional torus ( section [ sec : z2 ] ) .",

    "this imposes a cut - off and the computation ( [ eq : loga ] ) based on ( [ eq : mother 2 ] ) leads to @xmath112 of order @xmath113 .",
    "this logarithmic dependence will be confirmed for the ssep by a direct computation of the current fluctuations in sections [ sec : general graph ] and [ sec : z2 ] .    expression ( [ eq : loga ] ) shows that the cost of the fluctuations due to the vortices is low and one may wonder if the vortices are the optimal minimizers of ( [ eq : mother 2 ] ) or whether one should expect a more complex structure . to check this , we first note that the current @xmath50 in is divergence free , thus it can be represented as the sum of the curl of a vector field @xmath114 and a constant vector field @xmath115 @xmath116 and the current constraint ( [ eq : statio current ] ) becomes @xmath117 choosing the density equal to @xmath100 , ( [ eq : mother 2 ] ) reduces to the varitional principle @xmath118 where @xmath119 and @xmath120 satisfy the constraint",

    "this would lead to a @xmath119 which diverges logarithmically at the edges of the slit and therefore can not satisfy condition ( [ eq : stream current ] ) for any non - zero @xmath122 .",
    "nevertheless , using a cut - off similar to @xmath99 in ( [ eq : local vortex ] ) , we can recover the vortex like structures ( [ eq : test current ] ) .    for more general diffusive systems",
    "the hydrodynamic large deviations are governed by functionals of the type ( [ eq : mother ] ) which depend on diffusion and conductivity matrices @xcite .",
    "one could extend the previous discussion to these cases and the large deviation function @xmath123 would vanish as soon as @xmath124 . for open systems ,",
    "similar computations can be done as the fluctuations are dominated by vortices localized at the edges of the slit ( [ eq : test current ] ) and the reservoirs play a negligible role .",
    "we note that in analogy to ( [ eq : 2.7 ] ) we can consider the partial current specified in ( [ eq : 2.9 ] ) as a limiting case of an integrated current in a domain @xmath125",
