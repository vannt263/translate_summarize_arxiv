    "the description of electroweak symmetry breaking in the standard model , in terms of a fundamental scalar higgs field , is almost certainly incomplete .",
    "the quadratically divergent radiative corrections to the higgs mass suggest the existence of new physics at tev energies that stabilizes the weak scale . until recently , all theories for this stabilization",
    "could be grouped into two categories : those that rely on new strong dynamics or compositeness near a tev ( such as technicolor , composite higgs , or theories with a low fundamental planck scale ) , and those with low - scale supersymmetry .",
    "theories with low scale supersymmetry are particularly attractive since they allow a perturbative description of the physics that softens the quadratic divergences , and naturally lead to light higgs bosons , as seems favored by precision electroweak data .",
    "recently , a qualitatively new category of realistic theories of electroweak symmetry breaking has been introduced @xcite .",
    "these models , based on the physics of `` theory space ''  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , offer a new mechanism for softening the quadratic divergences in the higgs mass .",
    "electroweak symmetry breaking is accomplished with naturally light higgs bosons , which descend from non - linear sigma model fields whose mass is protected by `` chiral '' symmetries of the sigma model ( the first attempts at models of this kind were the `` composite higgs '' theories @xcite ) .",
    "the physics is perturbative at energies parametrically above the tev scale , ultimately requiring uv completion near @xmath0 tev where the non - linear sigma model fields become strongly coupled .",
    "however , the physics of electroweak symmetry breaking and the new physics at the tev scale is weakly coupled .",
    "these models are fully realistic , incorporating fermion masses without producing dangerous flavor - changing neutral currents . additionally , there are new stable weakly interacting scalars which can provide wimp dark matter",
    ".    in @xcite the construction of naturally light scalars with gauge , yukawa and quartic self - couplings from theory space was described , and one fairly simple model of electroweak symmetry breaking was presented . in this paper , we describe this model in more detail and begin an exploration of its phenomenology .",
    "we start by describing the bosonic field content and symmetries of these models which are associated with an @xmath1 toroidal theory space ( or `` moose '' diagram ) and discuss how the light ( or `` little '' ) higgs fields emerge at low energies .",
    "subsequently we incorporate the standard model fermions along with their yukawa couplings .",
    "the chiral symmetry structure of the theory guarantees the absence of quadratic divergences in the little higgs masses at low orders in perturbation theory .",
    "we then explicitly compute the leading one - loop radiative corrections to the little higgs potential , verifying the absence of quadratic divergences .",
    "we find a calculable negative contribution to the little higgs mass squared from the large top yukawa coupling , which can naturally drive electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) .",

    ", we look at the simple circular theory space studied in @xcite with only 3 sites . turning on a uniform background value for the link fields : @xmath187 , the mass matrix squared , @xmath188 , for the charged gauge bosons is proportional to : @xmath189 we can easily see that @xmath190 does nt depend on @xmath110 since @xmath110 does nt appear anywhere on the diagonal . in terms of mass eigenstates , turning on v increases the mass squared of light fields but decreases the mass of heavy fields .",
    "it is similarly easy to see that @xmath191 does nt depend on @xmath110 , so there is neither quadratic nor log divergence at one loop in this model . in the @xmath2 case ,",
    "the mass matrix is proportional to : @xmath192 again there is no @xmath110 on the diagonal and thus no quadratic divergence .",
    "however @xmath193 , and so there is a log divergence in this case .    in our model with a 2 dimensional lattice of sites the mass matrices are larger , but the same observations hold true .",
    "radiative corrections generate mass terms : @xmath194 note that there is no @xmath195 term or linear term in @xmath132 due to the @xmath86 symmetry .",
    "if @xmath196 and @xmath197 , we will trigger electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) .",
    "since the quartic potential vanishes for @xmath198 , we also require @xmath199 to avoid rolling away along this flat direction .",
    "one might worry that after ewsb , @xmath200 and @xmath132 could get large vevs .",
    "however , the @xmath86 symmetry which leads to an unbroken @xmath201 symmetry even after electroweak symmetry breaking forbids odd powers of @xmath200 and @xmath132 . with positive @xmath202 ,",
    "both vevs vanish .    for @xmath183 , the mass terms in",
    "are dominated by finite contributions which are in principle calculable . in the @xmath2 case ,",
    "most of them are log divergent at one loop and therefore not calculable .",
    "however , a spurion analysis shows that even in that case , the mass _ difference _ between @xmath147 and @xmath203 is dominated by ir effects and is finite at one loop . in the limit where yukawa couplings are neglected",
    ", the theory has a @xmath88 symmetry under which @xmath147 and @xmath203 form a doublet and are therefore degenerate .",
    "consequently , the mass difference must come from fermion loops . by computing the fermionic contribution to the one - loop coleman - weinberg potential when @xmath2 , we find that this is indeed the case , the result being : @xmath204 this is negative for any values of @xmath205 and therefore can trigger ewsb in a natural way .",
    "this is an improvement over @xcite where ewsb was triggered by a non - zero @xmath129 ; here it is driven by top quark radiative corrections , much as in the mssm .      in the very low energy theory ,",
    "keeping only the classically massless modes , the higgs would get a quadratically divergent mass .",
    "it is the appearance of the heavy modes that cancel this divergence .",
    "for example it is the appearance of heavy `` kk '' gauge bosons at energy @xmath206 which cancels the divergence of the low energy gauge boson loop .",
    "similarly , it is the heavy fermions introduced to `` delocalize '' the top quark which cancel the divergent top quark loop of the very low energy theory . finally , the heavy scalars which get masses from the plaquettes are necessary to cancel the divergence from the higgs quartic couplings .",
    "this observation allows us to estimate the various scales of the theory such as the higgs mass and the cutoff @xmath207 .",
    "for example the one loop gauge contribution to the higgs mass is approximately @xmath208 where @xmath209 is the low energy coupling , i.e. the coupling of the unbroken gauge group .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the standard model case where : @xmath210 the presence of an extra @xmath211 factor in our case allows us to take the cutoff of our theory parametrically above the tev scale , near @xmath212 10100 tev , and still have perturbative new physics at the tev scale stabilizing the higgs .",
    "a similar conclusion can be reached for the quartic couplings .",
    "the same simple estimate can be done for the top quark contribution , but it is more model dependent : @xmath213 where @xmath214 is the top yukawa coupling given parametrically by @xmath215 . again the additional @xmath216 factor allows us to choose the cutoff in the @xmath217 tev region .",
    "to summarize , in the very low energy theory beneath the masses of the heavy modes , we have the standard model with 2 higgs doublets and other scalars in the @xmath218 gev region . at roughly @xmath219 tev , heavy fermions , scalars and vector bosons responsible for stabilizing the higgs mass appear .",
    "finally , at @xmath212 10100 tev our description of the physics in terms of non - linear sigma model fields breaks down and a uv completion is needed .",
    "although we can imagine many different possibilities for this uv completion ( such as susy , new strong dynamics , low scale quantum gravity , etc . ) , they do not affect our description of electroweak symmetry breaking and we do not discuss it here .",
    "the important point is that the cutoff of our theory ( where it becomes strongly coupled and a uv completion is needed ) is parametrically above the scale where perturbative new physics appears to stabilize the weak hierarchy .",
    "as we have seen , our theory has a natural geometric @xmath86 symmetry , generated by the @xmath69 rotation @xmath68 on theory space .",
    "the scalars @xmath220 , together with the standard model fermions , are charged under this @xmath86 , and it is then broken along with the electroweak symmetry when the higgs acquires its vev .",
    "however the combination @xmath221 of @xmath222 with a gauge transformation @xmath223 and a phase transformation on the fermions remains unbroken even after electroweak breaking : @xmath224 where @xmath225 is a fermion number under which @xmath226 s and @xmath154 s have charge @xmath227 and @xmath228 s and @xmath229 s have charge @xmath230 . under p ,",
    "the standard model higgses and fermions are even , @xmath231 while @xmath121 are odd @xmath232 since this is an unbroken symmetry even after ewsb , @xmath200 and @xmath132 do not acquire vevs as claimed earlier .",
    "furthermore , the lightest scalar in the @xmath121 sector will be exactly stable .",
    "depending on the parameters of the theory , this stable particle may be neutral , a linear combination of @xmath233 and @xmath132 .",
    "this particle with a mass in the @xmath218 gev range provides a natural wimp candidate for the dark matter of the universe , with weak - scale mass and cross - section .",
    "in this section we examine the smallest model , with @xmath2 , in detail .",
    "the price we pay for using such a small moose is the presence of small loops in the diagram , which are associated with operators generated with log divergent coefficients at one - loop .",
    "these operators must then be included in our lagrangian with arbitrary coefficients of natural size @xmath234 . for @xmath183 ,",
    "the natural size of the analogous operators is much smaller , and therefore negligible compared to the finite one - loop radiative correction .",
    "the gauge group of this model is @xmath235 .",
    "the @xmath86 symmetry allows for 2 independent @xmath160 couplings , but for simplicity we will take them to have a common value @xmath236 .",
    "the @xmath237 and @xmath162 gauge couplings are @xmath238 and @xmath239 .",
    "the moose diagram for the model is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : neq2moose ] .",
    "the relevant parts of the lagrangian are the kinetic terms , the 4 plaquettes , the 4 @xmath27 plaquettes , the fermion interactions and the operators generated with log divergence mentioned earlier .",
    "b ) is an unfolding of a ) .",
    "there are 4 independent sites : in b ) , any two sites related by a reflection through the vertical or the horizontal axis are identified .",
    "an example of this identification is shown by the dotted arrows .",
    "there are 8 independent link fields represented by the thick arrows .",
    "a ) shows clearly the sites and links while b ) makes the plaquettes and all the discrete symmetries apparent.,width=529 ]    for this particular model , the notation introduced earlier for the general @xmath59 torus is incomplete since there are two different links between every pair of adjacent sites .",
    "therefore , instead of writing down formul , we will represent these operators by pictures .",
    "the operators that can be generated purely through gauge interactions are represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : operator1 ] .",
    "we call the resulting operators @xmath240 , @xmath241 , @xmath242 and @xmath243 .",
    ", @xmath241,@xmath244 and @xmath243 included in the @xmath2 torus lagrangian .",
    "they consist of a product of links forming a closed path .",
    "the links included in the product are represented by the arrows , and the large base indicates a trace should be included before the corresponding link .",
    "the @xmath27 indicates that a @xmath27 matrix should be inserted in the product .",
    "the final @xmath86 invariant operators are obtained by summing over the @xmath87 rotations of these pictures .",
    "e ) is an example of this notation relevant for @xmath244.,width=529 ]    these operators appear with coefficient of natural size @xmath245 .",
    "we also have two operators induced through plaquette interactions , @xmath246 and @xmath247 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : operator2 ] .    and @xmath248 can be generated by the plaquette .",
    "again , they are gauge invariant products of the links represented by arrows , the large base representing a trace and they are implicitly symmetrized by @xmath87 rotations.,width=377 ]    these operators need two plaquettes to be generated and have natural size @xmath249 .",
    "thus our lagrangian contains : @xmath250 where the ellipses represent subdominant terms of order @xmath251 and higher .",
    "note that we have scaled the coefficients of these operators with the largest gauge coupling ; their natural sizes might somewhat smaller , corresponding to small values of the @xmath252 s and @xmath253 s .",
    "the very low energy theory contains the sm particles , two higgs doublets @xmath254 , one complex @xmath237 triplet scalar @xmath200 and one complex singlet scalar @xmath132 .",
    "the scalar potential comes from three sources : first the plaquettes give a quartic interaction for the little higgses .",
    "second , the operators in @xmath170 give mass terms .",
    "we assume that these mass squared terms are all positive .",
    "finally , in order to break the electroweak symmetry , we need a negative mass squared for the higgs .",
    "as advertised , this is achieved through the one loop top yukawa contribution to the higgs potential which was given in equation : @xmath255 to quartic order , the potential for the higgs doublets is then given by : @xmath256 where @xmath257 is given in term of the coefficients appearing in @xmath170 : @xmath258\\ ] ] assuming @xmath259 and @xmath260 , @xmath147 gets a vev : @xmath261 the physical spectrum is easily derived in unitary gauge where : @xmath262 the masses are : @xmath263    note that in this model @xmath264 can not decay to fermions or gauge bosons at tree level .",
    "after ewsb , the quartic potential generates cubic terms of the form @xmath265 and therefore these decays will dominate if kinematically allowed .",
    "otherwise @xmath264 will decay at loop level , for instance to gauge bosons via light scalar loops .",
    "similar considerations apply to @xmath266 .",
    "next we turn to the triplet and singlet masses .",
    "there are two electrically charged scalars , @xmath267 and @xmath268 , with masses @xmath269 the mass splitting can be related to the higgs doublets masses : @xmath270 there are also 2 complex neutral scalars , @xmath271 and @xmath272 , which are linear combinations of @xmath233 and @xmath132 .",
    "the lightest of @xmath273 , @xmath274 , @xmath271 and @xmath272 is stable since all these are odd under the discrete @xmath221 symmetry introduced in section [ sec : dark ] .",
    "phenomenologically , we need the neutral states to be lightest for dark matter .",
    "the charged states will then typically decay to neutral states along with ( on or off - shell ) @xmath275 s .",
    "in addition to the little higgses , the theory contains heavy tev scale modes that are responsible for stabilizing the weak scale : 3 @xmath237 triplets , @xmath276 , 3 @xmath237 doublets @xmath277 and 3 @xmath237 singlet @xmath278 vector bosons ; 1 complex and 1 real @xmath237 triplet @xmath279 , 3 @xmath237 doublets @xmath280 and 1 complex and 1 real @xmath237 singlet scalars @xmath281 .",
    "there are also heavy fermions which we denote collectively by @xmath153 .",
    "table [ table : heavy ] gives the masses of these modes before ewsb , their quantum numbers , their main decay modes and their transformation properties under the unbroken @xmath221 symmetry introduced in section [ sec : dark ] . for gauge bosons ,",
    "the masses are calculated by diagonalizing the mass matrix found by setting the link fields to unity in the kinetic term .",
    "the scalar mass matrix is extracted from the plaquette potential , expanding the exponentials to quadratic order .",
    "likewise , the interaction between the different modes are given by expanding the plaquettes and kinetic terms .",
    "the kinetic terms give vector - vector - scalar and scalar - scalar - vector couplings while the plaquettes give scalar - scalar - scalar coupling .",
    "it is straightforward to see that , when the little higgses are uniform in theory space , there are no little higgs - little higgs - heavy scalar couplings .      as an illustration ,",
    "we have chosen a typical set of parameters and calculated the full spectrum of the theory .",
    "for the input parameters in table [ table : para ] , the resulting spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] . with this choice of parameters ,",
    "the lightest higgs mass is 174 gev at tree level , and the uv completion scale is at 10 tev .",
    "it is interesting to compare the values of the input coefficients for the special operators with the low - energy one - loop log - divergent radiative corrections , ignoring the log factor . in all cases ,",
    "these input values are comparable to the one - loop corrections , demonstrating the absence of fine - tuning in these couplings .",
    "finally , the finite negative contribution to the higgs mass squared from the large top yukawa coupling is @xmath282 gev@xmath283 . for our light higgs mass @xmath284 gev ,",
    "this required a bare positive mass squared of @xmath285gev@xmath283 .",
    "these mass squared choices are moderately tuned at the 10% level .",
    "this modest tuning can be reduced either with a somewhat heavier higgs or with lighter masses for the vector - like @xmath153 fermions .",
    "@xmath286        @xmath287",
    "we have studied a class of realistic models of electroweak symmetry breaking in which the higgs appears as an extended object in theory space . this class of models , first introduced in @xcite ,",
    "is based on toroidal theory spaces .",
    "we reviewed and extended the analysis of the @xmath288 torus and studied the @xmath2 case in detail .",
    "although our analysis was based on a specific theory space , the mechanism of ewsb applies more generally .",
    "a robust prediction of all such models is the presence of at least two naturally light higgs doublets .",
    "this is a consequence of the higgs quartic couplings descending from plaquette interactions , producing commutator squared potentials . in the specific models studied in this paper",
    "there are additional weak triplets and singlets scalar at low energy .",
    "theory spaces often have geometric discrete symmetries , such as the @xmath86 symmetry which is broken to a @xmath201 after electroweak symmetry breaking in the model we discussed .",
    "the light triplets and singlets are odd under this symmetry and therefore the lightest of these states is stable , providing a wimp dark matter candidate .",
    "we also showed that the top quark can drive the higgs mass negative and trigger ewsb in a natural way . at tev energies ,",
    "new physics appears to stabilize the weak scale .",
    "this new physics takes the form of new heavy particles which soften each of the quadratic divergences of the low energy theory : heavy gauge bosons cancel quadratically divergent gauge boson loops , heavy scalars cancel the quadratic divergence from the low energy quartic couplings and heavy fermions cancel the quadratic divergence from the top loop .    in the @xmath2 case , we computed the full spectrum of the theory for a typical set of parameters , and briefly discussed the primary decay modes for the new fields , leaving a more detailed study of both the collider phenomenology and cosmological implications of this theory to future work",
    ".    how do our theories compare with supersymmetric models of electroweak symmetry breaking ?",
    "one of the features that makes supersymmetry attractive is its ability to accommodate precision electroweak data , as a consequence of its weakly coupled description of ewsb . since our models are weakly coupled at the tev scale , they share this success . in supersymmetry , there is often a flavor problem associated with flavor - changing neutral currents for the light generations , mediated by superpartners . in our models ,",
    "the only new states which carry flavor are the heavy fermions which `` delocalize '' the top quark in theory space , and so there are no flavor - changing interactions involving the first two generations at the tev scale .",
    "( this is similar to the situation in the `` more minimal '' supersymmetric models with heavy first two generation scalars @xcite ) .",
    "the supersymmetric standard model also has the virtue that it can be extrapolated to energies much higher than the tev scale .",
    "a remarkable success of such an extrapolation is the supersymmetric prediction of gauge coupling unification .",
    "this prediction remains one of the most compelling arguments for supersymmetry and the energy desert .",
    "by contrast , our effective theory description of the physics breaks down at relatively low scales , @xmath212 10100 tev .",
    "there are straightforward uv completions of our non - linear sigma models into linear sigma models , but like the standard model , these themselves suffer from a ( slightly reduced ) `` hierarchy problem '' .",
    "we can instead consider supersymmetrizations of these linear sigma models above @xmath212 10100 tev , or perhaps strongly coupled gauge dynamics or even low scale gravity models above this scale .",
    "whatever this uv completion physics is , it completely decouples from the physics of ewsb , and is therefore irrelevant for upcoming collider experiments . as for gauge coupling unification ,",
    "there have been a number of recent proposals on retaining this success at low energies ( see for instance @xcite ) , or recovering the correct prediction of the weak mixing angle from different group - theoretic structures @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to pursue combining these ideas with our models , and some work along these lines is already in progress @xcite .",
