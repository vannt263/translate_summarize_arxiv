    "blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxies have been suggest as the best local analogs to such galaxies  @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the bcds have x - ray emission dominated by high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs )  @xcite .",

    "linden  et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) explain that the mechanism driving this bright hmxb population increase is due to an increase in the fraction of binaries accreting through roche lobe overflow ( rlo ) as opposed to wind accretion systems .",

    "these objects would have properties similar to the galaxies that have been observed using the lyman break technique @xcite .",

    ", we observed a sample of ten lyman break analogues ( lbas ) .",
    "these galaxies are part of a rare population of local galaxies which have properties that match the high - redshift , star - forming lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) with regards to stellar mass , star formation rate , and metallicity  @xcite .",

    "the sample of lba galaxies discussed in this paper also meet this criterion ( see table  [ tab : results ] ) .",
    "as with the blue compact dwarf galaxies , the lba x - ray luminosity is expected to be enhanced with respect to star formation rate due to relatively low metal content @xcite .",

    "determining the @xmath9/sfr relation for this sample of analogues will allow us to better understand the role of hmxbs in the early universe .",

    "m12 does not directly provide metallicity measurements for their data , so in this case we compare with the results of @xcite , who found reported metallicities for 19 of the galaxies in m12 .",

    "we find the relation @xmath29 with a dispersion of @xmath4  dex ( see figure  [ fig : lx_sfr ] ) . in this case , the x - ray luminosity was calculated from the net counts in the @xmath3  kev range using @xmath30 plus the galactic absorption along the line of sight ( see table  [ tab : results ] ) .",
    "we wish to compare these results to the results of m12 , but their @xmath1sfr relation uses only resolved xrb point sources , whereas our results use the total , unresolved x - ray emission from the galaxies . in a follow - up paper ,",

    "they found that this also correlates linearly with sfr such that , @xmath31 with a dispersion of @xmath32  dex .",
    "@xmath33 is the unresolved emission , from which the contribution of backgrounds and unresolved hmxbs was subtracted .",
    "the sample consisted of a subset of 21 out of the original 29 galaxies used in the m12 paper i. expanding this relation to the @xmath3  kev range , using the two - component thermal plus power law model discussed in @xcite , we find a conversion factor of 1.17 .",

    "we split the sample into the @xmath25 m12 subset ( blue squares ) and the remaining galaxies ( @xmath42 ) , which consist mostly of bcds found in @xcite ( green circles , black triangles ( @xmath9 upper limits only ) ) .",
    "the errors on luminosity @xmath43 for the comparison sample are estimated from threshold luminosity and measured luminosity ( table  1 in @xcite ) , assuming poisson errors . all data from @xcite",
    "have been corrected to be consistent with the measurement techniques used in this paper , as described in the previous section .",
    "we exclude data that have only upper limits on @xmath9 from our fitting procedure .",
    "testing for a correlation between metallicity and @xmath9/sfr over all 39 galaxies in the combined data set , we find a negative correlation at the 99.9% significance level , based on a spearman s rank correlation test .",

    "@xcite used population synthesis to show that for star forming regions with @xmath60 , the bright hmxb population would be enhanced . @xcite also used population synthesis and simulations to show that the x - ray luminosity per sfr increases by nearly a factor of ten for metallicities less than 10 per cent solar .",
    "@xcite fit a polynomial to the x - ray luminosity per sfr as a function of metallicity . using their parameters and solar values of @xmath61 and @xmath62 ,",
    "we calculated an expected mean value of @xmath63/sfr@xmath64 in the @xmath65  kev range .",
    "this is completely consistent with our results .",
    "the possible existence of a @xmath9sfr  metallicity plane is intriguing but not unexpected from simulations @xcite . from figure",
    "[ fig : sfr_metal ] , one can see that the three distinct populations of galaxy types ( bcds , spirals , lbas ) occupy three distinct regions of the sfr  metallicity space .",
    "thus the existence of a plane may arise from different @xmath9sfr relations for these galaxy types and not necessarily the metallicity .",
    "the fact that lbas have marginally enhanced x - ray emission relative to the m12 sample in the same metallicity range may suggest that other galactic properties , such as hi gas fraction , affect the @xmath9sfr relation . a study of bcds or lbas over a wider range in metallicity and sfr ( unsampled regions of figure  [ fig : sfr_metal ] ) could shed light on whether the @xmath9sfr  metallicity relation holds or if other properties need to be considered . expanding",
    "the metallicity range of each galaxy type would allow for a better test of the correlations seen between x - ray luminosity , sfr , and metallicity as it provides a more uniform sample .",
    "we find that the @xcite prediction ( black line , figure  [ fig : plane_results ] ) provides a fit that is not significantly worse than the power law relation ( red dashed line ) . from figure",
    "[ fig : plane_results ] one can see that this is not surprising since the fragos prediction straddles the straight power law fit .",
    "neither the power law model nor the fragos model are physically motivated but instead are parameterized fits .",
    "previous studies of local analogues to early universe galaxies have shown enhanced x - ray binary populations  @xcite and enhanced total x - ray luminosities  @xcite relative to the sfr of the respective galaxies .",
    "we continued this line of study by examining the x - ray luminosity per sfr of a sample of ten local analogues to the high redshift lyman break galaxies .",
    "five of the lbas we studied had been previously observed and analysed by @xcite .",
    "the other five lbas were observed by chandra specifically for this study .",
    "our results may be summarized as follows :    1 .   the @xmath9/sfr relation for our sample is given by @xmath66 with a dispersion of @xmath4  dex . compared to the m12 result for unresolved sources @xmath67",
    ", we find a factor of @xmath35 increase in @xmath9/sfr with a chance probability of 0.018 that these two samples were drawn from the same population ( a significance of @xmath7 ) .",
    "we find that when including gas - phase metallicity , the above result is consistent with the prediction of @xcite based on populations synthesis models ( figure  [ fig : lx_sfr ] ) .",
    "for an average metallicity of @xmath68 or @xmath69 , @xcite predicts a value for @xmath70/sfr@xmath64 , assuming a solar oxygen abundance of @xmath71 .",
    "this is consistent with our observed value of @xmath72 .",
    "3 .   fitting the @xmath9sfr  metallicity relation with the form @xmath73 gives @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and dispersion @xmath32  dex .",
    "these three results provide further evidence that metallicity plays a major role in the evolution of the @xmath9/sfr relation for galaxies . using local galaxies as analogues suggests that the large , proto - galaxies and the small dwarf galaxies of the early universe had enhanced x - ray emission due mainly to their low metallicities .",
    "the effects of enhanced x - ray emission before and during the epoch of reionization would be increased heating of the intergalactic medium , thereby resulting in an earlier onset in the rise of the 21  cm power during this epoch .",
    "many simulations have been done to predict these effects on the redshifted 21  cm line ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . using the results of @xcite ( see their figure  2 ) , a factor of ten increase in the @xmath9/sfr relation ( as suggested by the results of @xcite and consistent with the predictions of @xcite ) would result in a weakening of the redshifted 21  cm brightness temperature by a factor of 2 - 3 ( or @xmath76 ) .",
    "this also results in an earlier onset of the rise of x - ray heating with @xmath77 .",
