    "in the event of a positive detection of a primordial gravitational wave background , confirmation of such a relationship would provide strong support for inflation .",
    "however , one could not determine from this equation alone whether inflation arose within the context of a braneworld scenario or from standard relativistic cosmology . in the latter case , next  order corrections in the slow  roll parameters lead to corrections involving the scalar spectral index and it would be interesting to determine whether similar terms arise in the braneworld model .",
