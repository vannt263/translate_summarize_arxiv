    "a silhouette disk is one of the most suitable targets to investigate the primordial composition of a planetary disk by using its central star as a background light source .",
    "the orion nebula cluster ( onc ; m42 ) and its neighbor region m43 are the nearest high - mass star - forming regions , exhibiting a number of silhouette disks . since the first discovery by @xcite , the number of the silhouette disks has significantly increased @xcite and currently the number of the pure silhouette disks is @xmath230 , which enables us to conduct a systematic study for disk absorption features .",
    "water ice in protoplanetary disks is particularly important , because it is thought to evolve to icy bodies such as comets in our solar system . in theory ,",
    "the distribution of the water ice in the protoplanetary disks has been extensively investigated as a key parameter for the planet formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which predicts the inner boundary around 2  au of the water ice presence ( `` snow line '' ) where the temperature is 170k for the ice condensation .",
    "although the mid - plane of the disks is of the greatest interest for the planet formation , it is difficult to observationally probe into the mid - plane of the disks due to high extinction .",
    "@xcite constructed the model of the water ice absorption in the circumstellar disk through the water ice detection for the edge - on disk object crbr 2422 - 3423 in @xmath3 ophiuchus dark cloud , which suggests a critical inclination angle of the disk for strong water ice detection to be around 69@xmath4 .",
    "since silhouette disks show a clear morphology of the circumstellar disks , the inclination angle of the disks can be more accurately estimated .",
    "in fact , the silhouette disks located in m42 and m43 show a wide range of the disk inclination angle , and those are very suitable for examining the critical inclination angle in a larger sample .",
    "the silhouette disks in m42 and m43 are exposed to the intense uv radiation from o and b stars , and the critical inclination angle may be increased to a larger value by dissociation and desorption process of the outer layer of the disks . since star formation occurs more commonly in high - mass star - forming regions , it is important to understand the water ice formation under such environments .",
    "strong water ice absorption at 3@xmath0 band is very useful to investigate characteristics of the water ice materials .",
    "in particular , it is well known that the profile and peak of the water ice absorption in the wavelengths of 2.93.3@xmath0 provides the information of its grain size and crystallinity .",
    "while larger water ice grains bring its absorption peak toward longer wavelength , more crystallinity causes a sharper peak at longer wavelength @xcite .",
    "the water ice feature so far detected at 3@xmath0 band toward young stellar objects is usually explained by the combination of amorphous and crystallized water ice absorption with a grain size of 0.10.5@xmath0 , whose peaks are located at 3.03.05@xmath0 and @xmath2 3.1@xmath0 , respectively @xcite .",
    "* hereafter paper i ) carried out @xmath5-band spectroscopy of five bright young stellar objects with silhouette disks in m42 and m43 and detected a deep water ice absorption ( @xmath1=0.67 ) toward d216 - 0939 in m43 , which is associated with a large silhouette disk ( @xmath21000  au in diameter ) . in the profile of the water ice absorption , the 3.2@xmath0 enhancement that is characteristics of crystallized water ice with large grains ( @xmath21@xmath0 ;",
    "* ) was seen , and it suggested grain growth and thermal processing in the disk . since the nearby star jw 671 @xcite shows no water ice feature ,",
    "the water ice detected for d216 - 0939 is concluded to reside in the protoplanetary disk of d216 - 0939 .",
    "whereas d121 - 1925 also shows the water ice absorption , its nearby star jw 370 @xcite exhibits the same depth and profile of the water ice absorption , which suggests that the water ice toward d121 - 1925 is in the foreground . there is no evidence of the water ice feature detected in the remaining three objects : d182 - 332 , d183 - 405 , and d218 - 354 .",
    "the low inclination angle of the disk is likely the primary cause for no water ice feature in the disk in the line of sight for d121 - 1925 , d182 - 332 , d183 - 405 , and d218 - 354 .",
    "another possible cause is low abundance of the water ice in the disk due to the strong uv radiation from o and b stars .",
    "increasing the number of spectra will help to understand the prevalence of water ice in the silhouette disks .",
    "adaptive optics ( ao ) with large ground - based telescopes gives us a unique opportunity to obtain the highest spatial resolution with diffraction limited images , which reaches to @xmath6 01 resolution at 3@xmath0 . at the distance to m42 ( 414 pc ;",
    "* ) and m43 ( 440 pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the direct study of the outer region of protoplanetary disks can be done with 40 au resolution .",
    "many circumstellar disks have been so far detected using ao , including the disks with high inclination angle ( @xmath780@xmath4 ) which sometimes show an edge - on morphology @xcite . in addition , ao observation has another significant advantage to provide increased sensitivity for photometry of point sources and use of a narrower slit for spectroscopy .",
    "it is crucial to use ao to increase the reachable targets associated with the silhouette disks . for ao observations , a nearby and bright reference source to sense the wavefront of light from the target region",
    "is required . for targets that do not have such nearby and bright natural stars ,",
    "an artificial laser guide star ( lgs ) is available at some large telescopes . in the outskirt regions of m42 and m43",
    ", lgs plays an essential role to make the observation of silhouette disk possible .    using the subaru telescope , we present natural guide star ( ngs ) and lgs images and spectra of four sources with silhouette disks in the outskirt of m42 and m43 regions , namely d053 - 717 , d132 - 1832 , d141 - 1952 , and d216 - 0939 @xcite . in section 2",

    "the observational procedures and applied data analysis are described in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "the ao images and spectra for all the targets are shown , and the water ice optical depths are derived after the spectral continuum fit . the water ice feature in each disk is discussed in section 5 .",
    "the summary is described in section 6 .",
    "targets were selected from all the pure silhouette disk samples @xcite with three criteria of ( 1 ) an inclination angle of @xmath755@xmath4 , ( 2 ) a distance of @xmath7 200@xmath8 from the o and b stars , and ( 3 ) a brightness of @xmath9 @xmath6 15.5 . as for the first criterion about the inclination angle , paper i found that the silhouette disks likely have the critical inclination angle of 65@xmath475@xmath4 for the detection of the water ice in disks , and it is required to confirm this possible critical angle by observing more targets with inclination angle 65@xmath475@xmath4 .",
    "the second criterion is to avoid the environmental effect of strong uv radiation from the o and b stars .",
    "in fact , the previous samples with no water ice feature in paper i are all close to the trapezium cluster , and it was difficult to distinguish the environmental cause and the geometrical cause for no water ice detection . the third criterion is for obtaining sufficient signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) for spectroscopy at @xmath5 .",

    "therefore , it is concluded that the real source associated with the silhouette disk is located behind d053 - 717 . in our ao images at @xmath9 and @xmath21 , no other source than d053 - 717 is detected .",
    "the water ice absorption exists at 3.1@xmath0 with an optical depth of 0.70 for this target .",
    "the equation between column density of water ice ( @xmath41 ) and visual extinction ( @xmath15 ) adopted in paper i , @xmath41 = ( 1@xmath3310@xmath42 ) @xmath33 ( @xmath15@xmath25@xmath43 ) @xcite is used for estimate of @xmath15 .",
    "first , the column density of the water ice toward d132 - 1832 is derived to be 1.58@xmath3310@xmath44 @xmath35 using @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "the threshold visual extinction of @xmath43 ranges from 2  mag to 10  mag as an indicator of harshness of the uv field among various star forming clouds . as a result ,",
    "@xmath15 for d132 - 1832 is estimated to be 17.625.6  mag .",
    "this @xmath15 is far greater than the average visual extinction ( 12  mag ) of the foreground `` neutral lid '' in m42 @xcite and also significantly larger than the more local visual extinction ( @xmath210  mag ) showed in figure  [ fig - sample ] @xcite .",
    "therefore the detected water ice is concluded to be localized around the object d132 - 1832 .",
    "since the nearby star 2mass j05351361 - 0518329 has no water ice absorption , there is no common water ice material in front of those two stars . assuming that d132 - 1832 and 2mass j05351361 - 0518329 are located within the same region of m42 , then the detected water ice originates from the region within a projected distance of 568 ( 2352 au ) around d132 - 1832 .",
    "since the detailed analysis of the detected water ice profile for d132 - 1832 is somewhat difficult with the s / n obtained , the overall profile of the water ice feature extracted in figure  [ fig - d132-tau ] shows no broad absorption around 3.2@xmath0 and it is similar to the optical depth detected in the taurus edge - on disks @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the detected water ice grains originate from regions further out in the circumstellar disk rather than in the inner disk where large crystallized ice grains can be produced by grain growth and thermal processing .",
    "interestingly , @xcite pointed out that d132 - 1832 has been variable in the images taken with h@xmath32 filter of @xmath30 .",
    "the central star seems clearly visible right at the center of the silhouette disk on the first observing epoch of 1998 - 04 - 04-ut , and then it becomes invisible on the second epoch of 2004 - 01 - 18-ut .",
    "this variability suggests a change of the extinction in the disk between two epochs or an h@xmath32 flare on the first epoch @xcite . the image on another epoch ( 2005 - 04 - 10-ut ) provided as an online data by @xcite still shows a little emission from the central star in the f658n and strong emission in the f775w and f850lp filters .",
    "the images taken with the f775w and f850lp filters show evidence of scattered light .",
    "it is unknown whether the central star was optically visible or invisible on the epoch of our observation ( 2011 - 10 - 23-ut ) . at the present time we can not rule out variability due to an h@xmath32 flare and",
    "the amount of scattered light is not quantitatively understood .",
    "if the cause of the variability comes from a change in the extinction , then it would imply the water ice absorption would vary as well .",
    "normalized optical depth of the water ice feature for d132 - 1832 .",
    "in contrast to d216 - 0939 , no 3.2@xmath0 enhancement of the optical depth is observed . ]",
    "while the silhouette disk around d141 - 1952 is the smallest in size among our target samples , its disk mass derived from the submm measurement is the second most massive among the four targets ( table  [ tbl - sample ] ) .",
    "assuming the abundance ratio between the water ice and the total dust mass to be similar among the protoplanetary disks , abundant water ice exists in the disk of d141 - 1925 .",
    "the silhouette disk shows the lowest inclination angle of 5560among the targets , and most likely our line of sight toward the central star does not pass through the circumstellar disk around the object .      as shown in figure  [ fig - resolved - bin ] , the d216 - 0939 spectra were spatially resolved with 01 resolution using the ao188 system with ngs mode .",
    "the bluish continua seen in the spectra of ne and sw positions are consistent with the bluer scattered light in those regions .",
    "the contamination from the central star mentioned in section 4.2 affects ne and sw by the optical depth of 0.37 and 0.51 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the significant fraction of the optical depth measured at the locations of ne and sw originates from the water ice absorption at the center position , and the water ice absorption at ne and sw is very small ( @xmath1=0.08 and 0.06 , respectively ) .",
    "these shallower optical depths at the position of ne and sw indicate that the water ice materials attributed to the absorption detected in ne and sw are located at greater height from the mid - plane .",
    "focusing on the water ice feature detected in the center location of d216 - 0939 , the profile of the water ice absorption is compared with the water ice profile reported in paper i with a larger aperture ( 045 @xmath33 08 ) in figure  [ fig - d216-comp ] . in the figure ,",
    "the profiles of the water ice absorption are found to be almost identical with a possible decrease of the optical depth around 2.9@xmath0 and 3.6@xmath0 .",
    "the pure amorphous water ice has an absorption feature at 2.9@xmath0 , and therefore the decrease at 2.9@xmath0 can be explained by the lower fraction of the amorphous water ice .",
    "although the difference of the profiles at 2.9@xmath0 is small , the water ice composition is quantitatively estimated in the following by assuming that the difference is real .",
    "we apply exactly the same method as used in paper i , and the new result of the water ice optical depth in the region of 2.83.3@xmath0 is well matched to the composition of large - size crystallized water ice particles ( 77.2%@xmath114.0% ) and small - size amorphous water ice particles ( 22.8%@xmath114.0% ) with a minimum reduced @xmath46 and 1@xmath47 uncertainty . since the composition of the water ice detected on the first epoch is crystallized water ice particles of 71.4%@xmath112.7% and amorphous water ice particles of 28.6%@xmath112.7% , the results on those two epochs are overlapping within the 1@xmath47 uncertainty .",
    "the optical depths of the crystallized water ice ( @xmath48 ) are derived to be 0.55 and 0.69 on two observing epochs of 2006 - 01 - 15-ut and 2009 - 10 - 02-ut , respectively .",
    "different apertures were used for spectroscopy on the two epochs , and therefore these derived optical depths can not be directly compared .",
    "the large aperture of 045 @xmath33 08 used for extraction of the spectrum on the first epoch contains a large amount of scattered light from the central source . since the large - size grains are thought to settle toward the mid - plane of the disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the spectrum of the scattered light does not contain a significant amount of the large - size crystallized water ice .",
    "as a result , the scattered light component dilutes the optical depth of the crystallized water ice absorption . from the @xmath21 image in figure  [ fig - objimage ]",
    ", we estimate the fluxes of the scattered light component ( with an aperture of 045 @xmath33 08 ) and the central region ( with an aperture of 0225 @xmath33 011 ) of d216 - 0939 to be 2.29 @xmath33 10@xmath49 and 8.22 @xmath33",
    "10@xmath49 w m@xmath50 @xmath0@xmath51 , respectively .",
    "if the scattered light is assumed to contain no large - size crystallized water ice feature , this dilution effect leads to the change of @xmath48 by 0.20 . in reality",
    ", the scattered light includes at least partially the large - size crystallized water ice feature .",
    "thus , the optical depth change due to the dilution effect is 00.20 , and @xmath48 in the center region is estimated to be 0.550.75 on the first epoch .",
    "this optical depth range of the large - size crystallized water ice is consistent with @xmath48=0.69 detected on the second epoch .",
    "comparison of the normalized optical depth of the water ice absorption between large aperture ( 045 @xmath33 08 ) on 2006 - 01 - 15-ut and smaller region ( 0225 @xmath33 011 ) on 2009 - 10 - 02-ut around the photo center of d216 - 0939 . ]",
    "the variability of the water ice features has been detected toward several young stellar objects @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite discovered the large variation ( @xmath52 @xmath2 0.59 ) of the water ice in the edge - on disk around hv tau c with a time interval of 2.32 years and derived the possible size of the water ice cloud to be 1.4  au .",
    "no significant change of the large - size crystallized water ice feature in the time interval of 3.63 years indicates uniform distribution of the carrier of the water ice in the disk of d216 - 0939 .",
    "since the distribution of the crystallized water ice is not known well , we assume that it is located at the distance of 30  au from the central star , which is suggested for the first time as the lower limit of the crystallized water ice distribution in ylw 16a @xcite . based on this assumption",
    ", the possible water ice cloud must be @xmath7 3.48  au in size .",
    "combined with the water ice features detected in paper i , the relationship of the water ice optical depth with the inclination angle of the disks and the distance from the o and b stars is summarized in figure  [ fig - para - ice ] .",
    "it is noted that the water ice for d121 - 1925 is attributed to the foreground material .",
    "in addition , as pointed out in the above section , the lack of a water ice feature toward d053 - 717 is not well understood , but most likely d053 - 717 is not embedded in the silhouette disk . in this updated figure with the new samples ,",
    "the rapid change of the optical depth can be found in the gray area for both the inclination angle of the disk and the distance from the o and b stars . since uv radiation responsible for photodesorption of the water ice",
    "is gradually changed as a function of the distance , it is difficult to explain such a sudden change only by the difference of the distance for d141 - 1925 ( 21418 ) and d132 - 1832 ( 29419 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "as predicted in the model by @xcite , the different inclination angle can produce this kind of rapid change of the water ice absorption .",
    "therefore , we conclude the primary parameter for explaining the detected water ice absorption to be the inclination angle of the disk , and its critical angle is confirmed to be 6575@xmath4 .",
    "this suggests that the opening half - angles of the silhouette disks are around 70@xmath4 .",
    "this angle is almost the same angle derived for crbr 2422 - 3423 in @xmath3 ophiuchus by @xcite , and the intense uv radiation does not significantly affect the critical inclination angle of the disks .",
    "we present the ao images and spectra of the four silhouette disks in the outskirt region of m42 and m43 , and the following results are reported .",
    "* no water ice feature toward d053 - 717 and d141 - 1953 was detected , and moderate absorption of the water ice was found in the disks of d132 - 1832 and d216 - 0939 . * the water ice profile of d132 - 1832 shows no signature of large - size crystallized water ice , and thus it may not have experienced grain growth in the disk . * water ice absorption in the d216 - 0939 disk was spatially resolved .",
    "the center region shows the deepest absorption , and the large - size crystallized water ice component is identical to that detected on 2006 - 01 - 15-ut . *",
    "no time variation of the water ice in the d216 - 0939 disk was detected .",
    "since the time interval is 3.63 years , this suggests a uniform distribution of the large - size crystallized water ice in the lateral direction of 3.48  au . * summarizing the optical depths of the water ice absorption in the silhouette disks ,",
    "no significant water ice absorption is detected for the disks with an inclination angle of @xmath6 65@xmath4 . omitting the peculiar sample of d053 - 717",
    "( see section 5.1.1 ) , there seems to be a critical inclination angle of the silhouette disks of 6575@xmath4 for water ice to be detected , which agrees to the model of @xcite .",
    "this implies that the opening half - angle of the silhouette disks is about 70@xmath4 .",

    "we also thank the referee for many helpful comments .",
