    "the corresponding experimental observables are loss peaks in the atom number ( upper panel ) , which appear at values of the scattering length @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , where the three- , four- and five - body states cross the free atom threshold , respectively .",
    "the resonant values of the scattering length are predicted to be universally connected by the simple relations @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite . a more recent study @xcite",

    "the experimental challenge is to discriminate the five - body recombination signal against a strong background resulting from fewer - body processes .",

    "this article presents a combined theoretical and experimental study of universal few - body physics up to five - body states .",

    "our results highlight a new level of understanding concerning few - body physics and its experimental manifestations in ultracold atomic quantum gases .",
    "the theoretical analysis of @xmath2-body recombination processes requires the description of the @xmath2-body scattering continuum .",
    "the hyperspherical framework has been successfully applied to describe recombination processes for @xmath8 @xcite . in this framework , the hamiltonian is diagonalized adiabatically as a function of the hyperradius @xmath14 , which describes the overall size of the system , leading to a set of coupled one - dimensional schrdinger equations . at ultralow temperatures and large scattering lengths ,",
    "@xmath2-body recombination events are mainly controlled by scattering processes with incoming flux in the lowest @xmath2-body scattering channel and outgoing flux in deeper loss channels .",
    "the coupling to the deep channels is assumed to remain approximately unaffected as the scattering length and the collision energy are varied throughout our regime of interest .",
    "thus , all the relevant information comes from the analysis of the lowest @xmath2-body potential curve corresponding to the incoming scattering channel .",
    "however , the extraction of the hyperspherical potential curves and couplings becomes computationally unfeasible as the number of particles increases .",
    "currently , the numerical technology allows for the calculation of potential curves of three and four - body systems but no tractable method has yet been implemented that can calculate both the potential curves and couplings for @xmath15 .",
    "however , the trapped energy eigenvalue spectrum of a five - body system can be accurately obtained with current technology .",
    "thus , the present study extracts the relevant recombination information from an analysis of the trapped spectrum .",
    "our starting point is the hyperspherical description of the ultracold @xmath2-body recombination rate @xcite , @xmath16 where @xmath17{n}$ ] with @xmath18 being the atomic mass , @xmath19 is the incoming hyperradial scattering wavenumber and @xmath20 is the diagonal element of the s - matrix for the lowest channel ( 00 ) in the @xmath21 symmetry . for purely elastic scattering @xmath22 and",
    "the recombination rate is zero . in the limit in which every @xmath2-body collision leads to losses , @xmath23 .",
    "taking the thermal average in the full loss case at a temperature @xmath24 , one obtains the unitary limit for @xmath2-body recombination at low energy : @xmath25        based on potential curves computed for the three- and four - body cases , we expect that the five - body potential curve should have the topology depicted as a solid curve in fig.[fignew ] , i.e. , the lowest potential curve exhibits a barrier that separates the inner region ( small @xmath14 ) from the asymptotic scattering region at large @xmath14 .",
    "note that the effective mock - centrifugal barrier @xcite in the lowest @xmath2-body continuum channel at large @xmath14 is guaranteed to have the form ( for finite @xmath0 ) , @xmath26 .",
    "for this potential curve topology , an extension of the semiclassical ( wkbj ) treatment of berry @xcite to include the decay to the lowest channels yields @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the wkbj phase for the inner allowed region , @xmath29 is the wkbj tunneling integral in the barrier region , @xmath30 describes the decay to deeper , non - universal , channels and is treated as a fitting parameter , and @xmath31 ensures the proper normalization .",
    "thus , the determination of @xmath29 and @xmath28 for the relevant range of energy and scattering length gives an approximate description of five - body recombination .",
    "the novelty of our approach is the determination of @xmath29 and @xmath28 from an analysis of the trapped spectrum .",
    "the five - body trapped energy spectrum is obtained using a correlated gaussian basis set expansion @xcite ; for details see [ app1 ] . in the region where the five - body resonance occurs , the spectrum exhibits a series of avoided crossings between the five - body states bound in the inner region and the outer trap region states ( see fig.[fignew ] ) . in the wkbj approximation ,",
    "the quantization condition for the trapped potential curve ( dashed curve in fig.[fignew ] ) is @xmath32 , where @xmath33 . for collision energies below the barrier local maximum and away from the avoided crossings , the allowed energy eigenvalues occur when @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is an integer and @xmath36 .",
    "the phase @xmath28 in the four - boson case near the resonance energy is known from our previous work  @xcite to be well - described by @xmath37 , where @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are fitting parameters and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the van der waals radius and energy , respectively , as defined in @xcite . using this simple form in the five - body case and imposing the eigenstate condition for bound states , the values of @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 for @xmath43",
    "are extracted .    next",
    ", an analysis of the spectrum at the avoided crossings ( see e.g.  fig.[fignew ] ) determines @xmath29 , as explained in detail in [ app2 ] .",
    "the relevant avoided crossings occur when @xmath44 . for narrow avoided crossings ( @xmath45 )",
    ", the quantization condition reduces to @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "right at the avoided crossing , the energy difference between the two states ( 2@xmath48 ) is related to @xmath49 , namely as @xmath50 .",
    "the quantization condition thus reduces to @xmath51 .",
    "consequently knowledge of @xmath28 , @xmath52 and the energy avoided crossings allows the tunneling @xmath29 to be determined . at large @xmath14",
    ", interactions can be treated perturbatively leading to an hyperspherical potential curve valid at large @xmath14 that determines @xmath52 .    by changing the trapping confinement",
    "we can change @xmath52 and by introducing short range three - body forces we can modify @xmath28 without affecting the barrier .",
    "this allow us to explore how @xmath29 depends on both @xmath53 and @xmath0 .",
    "interestingly , at low energies our numerical results are nicely fitted by the formula : @xmath54 , which is in good agreement with the predicted threshold behavior @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "we prepare an optically trapped sample of cesium atoms in the lowest sub - level of the electronic ground state under similar conditions as described in ref.@xcite .",
    "the final evaporation process , performed at a magnetic field of 894 g ( @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the bohr radius ) , is stopped before the onset of bose - einstein condensation .",
    "the sample is then adiabatically recompressed to avoid further evaporation from the trap . at this point",
    ", the sample contains about @xmath58 atoms at a temperature @xmath59 and the confining optical potential has a mean trap frequency @xmath60hz , which results in a peak number density of @xmath61 and a peak phase space density close to unity .",
    "the wide @xmath1-wave feshbach resonance with its pole at 786 g offers ideal tuning properties @xcite , superior to the low - field region investigated in our previous works @xcite .",
    "we measured the decay of the atom number in the region of negative scattering length ( from @xmath62 at 863 g to @xmath63 at 873 g ) , where the four- and five - body recombination resonances are expected .",
    "after the recompression stage , we tune the scattering length to its target value , and we measure the atom number after a variable hold time by absorption imaging .",
    "after 100ms , the typical loss fraction is around 10% at @xmath64 and almost 35% at @xmath65 .",
    "the time evolution of the number @xmath66 of trapped atoms and temperature @xmath24 are determined by the different @xmath2-body loss processes and can be expressed @xcite in terms of a system of coupled differential equations , @xmath67 @xmath68 where @xmath69 represents the @xmath2-body rate coefficients .",
    "the averaged atom densities are evaluated as @xmath70 @xmath71^{(3n-3)/2}$ ] from a thermal distribution of the harmonically trapped atoms .",
    "equation ( [ difft ] ) incorporates the anti - evaporation heating @xcite that results from the higher recombination rate in the densest part of the cloud ( @xmath72 ) .    under our experimental conditions ,",
    "the first two terms of the sums can be omitted .",
    "one - body losses , resulting from collisions with the background gas , are negligible on our experimental time scale ( @xmath73 ) , and the use of atoms in their lowest sub - state assures that two - body losses vanish ( @xmath74 ) . therefore , the three - body rate coefficient @xmath75 is the leading term contributing to the atom losses , and its resonant behavior is related to the efimov trimers .",
    "this contribution is well understood and the coefficient @xmath75 can be described by the well - established result of effective field theory @xcite .",
    "the rates of recombination events involving more particles are generally smaller than the one related to three - body losses and the contributions are difficult to discriminate because of the very similar behavior .",
    "since the rate of recombination events for typical gas densities decreases rapidly with @xmath2 , contributions with @xmath76 are considered negligible in the following .     and",
    "@xmath77 , respectively , with an additional scaling factor for @xmath77 ; see text .",
    "the error bars include the statistical uncertainties from the fitting routine , the temperature and the trap frequencies . ]    a general fit to the experimental decay curves with @xmath75 , @xmath78 , and @xmath77 as free parameters in eq.([diff ] ) and eq.([difft ] ) turns out to be practically impossible .",
    "therefore , we fix @xmath75 according to effective field theory , with parameters @xmath79 and @xmath80 as determined for three - body recombination ( @xmath81 ) in our previous experiment @xcite",
    ". we can now interpret the additional losses in terms of four - body and five - body decay . in order to avoid any fitting ambiguities , we chose the simple approach to describe these losses either in terms of an effective four - body loss coefficient @xmath82 ( setting @xmath83 ) or an effective five - body loss coefficient @xmath84 ( setting @xmath85 ) .",
    "figure [ fig.3](a ) shows @xmath82 as extracted from our experimental data in comparison with the theoretical predictions , obtained by numerically evaluating @xmath78 from eqs.([ln ] ) and ( [ 1s ] ) for our experimental conditions .",
    "here we have adjusted the decay parameter to @xmath86 , which as a non - universal parameter depends on @xmath2 .",
    "the comparison shows that the losses observed around @xmath65 can be fully attributed to the four - body recombination resonance .",
    "the four - body loss peak position @xmath87 corresponds to @xmath88 and is in very good agreement with the theoretical value @xmath89 @xcite and previous observations @xcite .",
    "in contrast the enhancement of losses centered at about @xmath64 can not be interpreted in terms of the known universal four - body cluster states , suggesting that a different loss mechanism is present .",
    "an alternative representation of the same data in terms of @xmath84 is shown in fig.[fig.3](b ) , together with the results of our theoretical model for @xmath77 ; here we adjusted the relevant decay parameter to @xmath90 .",
    "the model nicely explains the loss rates in the region where three- and four - body losses can not account for the experimental observations .",
    "remarkably , the resonance position @xmath91 is in agreement with the theoretical predictions @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "however , quantitatively , the experimental values for @xmath77 are about 15 times larger than the calculated ones . to account for this ,",
    "we introduce a corresponding scaling factor .",
    "we find that this deviation might derive from non - universal effects that modify the value of the calculated wkb phase @xmath29 by about 10% , which remains within the realistic uncertainty range of our theory .    an experimental search for higher - order recombination resonances ( @xmath76 ) that would be expected at lower values of the scattering length did not show clear signatures .",
    "a general problem arises , namely that the phase - space density can not be further increased without causing the collapse of a bose - einstein condensate at negative values of @xmath0 . to induce faster losses ,",
    "adiabatic compression can increase the density , but then the higher temperatures cause increasing problems with the unitarity limit for high @xmath2 . by decreasing the temperature , constraints by the unitarity limit",
    "can be avoided , but then losses for high @xmath2 get so small that they become practically unobservable .",

    "the red dotted line corresponds to the losses predicted for three - body recombination only , while the dashed green line and the blue solid line include also contributions from four- and five body recombination , as quantified in this work . a cut - off to the maximum losses",
    "has been applied according to eq.([uni ] ) , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "the inset shows a close up of the region of dominant four- and five - body recombination and compares the theoretical results with the experimental observations . ]",
    "based on the above results and parameters , we model the general loss behavior in the region of interest . figure [ fig.2 ] shows an example for three , four- and five - body recombination by plotting the atom losses , under typical experimental conditions , for a fixed hold time and variable scattering length .",
    "the  family portrait \" of @xmath2-body recombination highlights the different contributions and confirms how the different loss features dominate the losses at the resonant positions .",
    "the experimental data plotted in the inset show that the peak positions and the magnitude of losses are in very good agreement with the simulated losses .",
    "note that the somewhat higher experimental losses can be attributed to an additional loss that occurs during the ramp to the target magnetic field strength .",
    "by pushing the limits of ultracold few - body physics , we have explored a universal five - body recombination resonance both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "the observed series of recombination features , which we interpret in terms of three- , four- and five - body recombination resonances , provides crucial evidence for the existence of a family of universal @xmath2-body bound states tied to efimov trimers .",
    "the infinite series of @xmath2-boson cluster states represents a paradigm for the general implications of efimov physics for many - body systems .",
    "we speculate that similar scenarios also exist for other few - body systems of increasing size , containing fermionic constituents or particles of different masses , with important consequences for the interaction properties of the many - body system .",

    ". national science foundation .",
    "a. z. was supported within the marie curie project lattrics 254987 of the european council .",
    "a crucial ingredient of our recombination analysis is the accurate extraction of the five - body trapped spectrum .",
    "the trapped few - boson hamiltonian is given by @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the trapping frequency , @xmath95 is the two - body potential and @xmath96 is a three - body potential . here ,",
    "@xmath97 and @xmath98 are the ranges of the two and three - body potentials that are fixed during the calculation , and @xmath99 .",
    "the two - body potential strength @xmath100 is used to tune the two - body scattering length and @xmath101 is set to zero in most calculations ( see discussion below ) . to relate the model potential with the experimental we rely on the universal character of the low energy few - boson physics and we relate @xmath97 with the van der waals length @xmath102 so that the three- and four - body recombination peaks coincide with those experimentally observed . in this transformation , we relate the energy scales so that they scale as inverse length squared .    to extract the recombination parameters , the five - body spectrum is analyzed as a function of the scattering length and the trapping confinement . the scattering length is changed in the region @xmath103 and the trapping frequency is changed so that the corresponding trapping length @xmath104 varies in the range @xmath105 .",
    "this region of scattering lengths and energies corresponds to the low energy region where the five - body resonance occurs .",
    "the three - body interaction is used to shift the position of the five - body resonance and explore the dependence of the recombination on the scattering length .",
    "the range of the three - body potential is taken to be @xmath98 , which is smaller than the two - body @xmath97 so that it is mainly relevant at small hyperradii , i.e. so that its main contribution in our recombination formula is to change the inner phase .",
    "for the three - body interactions considered , the spectrum follows the linear dependence with the scattering length that is expected at small and negative scattering lengths .",
    "this linear dependence arises from only two - body physics which , in the hyperspherical framework , is described by the long - range behavior of the potential curves . using the zero - range model of the two - body interaction , one can derive a first order correction of the hyperspherical potential curve . here , we follow a similar procedure to that on ref .",
    "@xcite , but for a set of coordinates in which the center of mass has been removed .",
    "in this approximation , the lowest potential takes the form @xmath106 the first two terms correspond , respectively , to the hyperangular or `` mock - centrifugal '' kinetic energy and the trapping potential ; and the third term represents the interaction corrections .",
    "equation  [ hrpot ] is _ only _ valid for small @xmath107 in the region where @xmath14 is much larger than the interaction range . using perturbation analysis ,",
    "one derives the well - known corrected energy of the lowest state , @xmath108 our numerical calculations , with and without the three - body forces , show the linear behavior described in eq .",
    "[ elinear ] in the region @xmath109 .",
    "this suggests that the hyperradial potential in the @xmath110 is well described by eq .",
    "[ hrpot ] and that , in this region , the potential is independent of the three - body forces .",
    "thus , it is consistent to interpret the main contribution of the three - body interaction as a modification of the short range physics that controls @xmath111 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the calculations are carried out using a correlated gaussian basis set expansion limited to describe @xmath112 trapped states since the energetically lowest scattering continuum corresponds to zero angular momentum and positive parity . in this computation , we are only interested in the lowest trapped states which , in the hyperspherical picture , are supported mainly by the lowest potential curve .",
    "therefore , the basis set is designed to accurately describe those states .",
    "the calculations include thousands of basis functions which are optimized for different scattering lengths and trap lengths .",
    "to verify the convergence of the energies , we carry out several optimization steps .",
    "the typical spectrum obtained by this analysis is shown in fig.[s1](a ) .",
    "to extract the semiclassical recombination parameters , we repeat the same semiclassical analysis used to derive eqs .  ( 2,3 ) but for a hyperspherical potential with the trapping potential ( see fig .",
