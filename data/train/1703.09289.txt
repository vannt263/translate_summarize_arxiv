    "interactions between nucleons ( @xmath7 ) and composite nuclei ( @xmath8 ) are usually modeled by two - body effective optical or binding potentials acting between structureless particles .",
    "this scheme works quite well for stable tightly bound nuclei but may become a poor approximation for exotic nuclei that nowadays are extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "an improvement of the structureless nucleus model , at a first step , consists in explicitly considering also its lowest excited states ( @xmath9 ) , thereby accounting for the compositeness of the nucleus @xmath8 in an approximate way .",
    "this extension has been proposed long ago @xcite and applied to numerous studies of elastic and inelastic @xmath10 scattering .",
    "however , the application of interaction models including the excitation of the involved nucleus , also called the core excitation , to three - body nuclear reactions , e.g. , deuteron ( @xmath11 ) stripping and pickup , is still a complicated task .",
    "first studies of @xmath12 reactions demonstrating the importance of the core excitation @xcite were based on two - body - like approaches such as the distorted - wave born approximation ( dwba ) and coupled - channels born approximation ( ccba ) that relied on deuteron - nucleus optical potentials .",
    "only quite recently the three - body calculations have emerged that include the core excitation .",
    "extensions of the dwba @xcite and continuum discretized coupled channels ( cdcc ) method @xcite mostly focused on the breakup reactions , in particular , of @xmath13 .",
    "the calculations for neutron transfer reactions @xmath14 and @xmath15 were performed using rigorous faddeev three - body scattering theory @xcite in the form of alt , grassberger , and sandhas ( ags ) equations @xcite for transition operators , solved in the extended hilbert space @xcite .",
    "the latter works demonstrated that in the deuteron stripping and pickup the core excitation effect can not be simply simulated by the reduction of the cross section according to the respective spectroscopic factor ( sf ) .",
    "it was found that extracting the sf from the ratio of experimental and theoretical transfer cross sections , as often used with the adiabatic distorted wave approximation ( adwa ) calculations @xcite , may lead to a strong underestimation of the sf .",
    "calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite employed the rotational model @xcite for the excitation of the @xmath16 core ; the most prominent core - excitation effects have been observed for the @xmath14 transfer to the ground state of @xmath17 whose dominant component corresponds to an @xmath18-wave neutron coupled to the @xmath19 ground state , i.e. , the orbital angular momentum transfer for this reaction is @xmath5 .",
    "in contrast , for the @xmath20 transfer leading to the excited state @xmath21 the core - excitation effects have been less remarkable .",
    "it is therefore very important to clarify the systematics of the core - excitation effects in transfer reactions , investigating other types of excitation mechanisms and bound states .",
    "furthermore , a deeper understanding may be gained by disentangling the effects of two- and three - body nature .",
    "the study of @xmath22 transfer reactions intended in the present work leads to the desired goal and is interesting for several reasons .",
    "first , the @xmath23 ground state has a significant component of @xmath24-wave neutron coupled to the @xmath25 ground state , thereby allowing the extension of systematics from refs .",
    "@xcite to the @xmath24-wave neutron state and @xmath6 transfer .",
    "second , the lowest excitation of the @xmath26 core @xmath27 has a vibrational character , giving opportunity to investigate the vibrational model for the nucleon - core interaction @xcite in the context of transfer reactions .",
    "last but not least there are experimental data for @xmath22 transfer reactions at 10.5 mev / nucleon beam energy @xcite that have not yet been analyzed with rigorous faddeev - type calculations .    in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we shortly recall the three - body scattering equations with core excitation , and in sec .",

    "the numerical technique for calculating deuteron - nucleus reactions with the inclusion of the core excitation is taken over from refs .",
    "@xcite but further developments are needed to get insight into separate core - excitation contributions of the two- and three - body nature .",
    "the method is based on the integral formulation of rigorous faddeev - type three - body scattering theory for transition operators as proposed by alt , grassberger , and sandhas @xcite , but extended for the hilbert space @xmath28 whose sectors correspond to the core being in its ground ( g ) or excited ( x ) state .",
    "these sectors are coupled by the nucleon - core two - body potentials @xmath29 where the superscripts @xmath30 and @xmath31 , being either @xmath32 or @xmath33 , label the internal states of the core , and the subscript @xmath34 , being @xmath8 , @xmath35 , or @xmath36 , labels the spectator particle in the odd - man - out notation .",
    "consequently , the respective two - body transition operators @xmath37 and three - body transition operators @xmath38 couple @xmath39 and @xmath40 as well .",

    "the core - excitation effects can be separated into contributions of two- and and three - body nature .",
    "the former consists in modifying @xmath53 through intermediate core excitations , i.e. , through the terms of type @xmath54 and so on in the iterated coupled - channel lippmann - schwinger equation .",
    "the contribution of the three - body nature arises due to nondiagonal components @xmath55 and @xmath56 that are responsible for the coupling of the two hilbert sectors in eq .  ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath57 and so on , yielding , in fact , an energy - dependent effective three - body force ( e3bf ) .",

    "[ fig : cex23 ] .",
    "we note a formal similarity between these contributions and the so - called dispersive and three - nucleon force effects arising in the description of the three - nucleon system with the @xmath58-isobar excitation @xcite . since the full core - excitation effect will be extracted from the solution of eq .  , to get insight into the importance of separate two- and and three - body contributions it is enough to exclude one of them .",

    "[ fig : se ] increases with increasing energy , and their ratio becomes angle - dependent , thereby indicating that the factorization conjecture fails at higher energies .",

    "we emphasize that at forward angles this deviation is in opposite direction as compared to the excited state @xmath4 , e.g. , @xmath127 at @xmath122 mev and @xmath125 .",

    "quite surprisingly , even at @xmath117 mev it turns out to be significant .",
    "consequently , the core - excitation effect of the two - body nature must be significant as well to cancel the e3bf to a large extent , especially at @xmath117 mev , such that their sum reproduces the full core - excitation effect .",
    "we note that substantial cancellation of the corresponding two- and three - body effects due to the @xmath58-isobar excitation was often observed also in the nucleon - deuteron scattering @xcite .",
    "we studied also sensitivity of the transfer cross sections to the neutron - proton tensor force and @xmath24-state component in the deuteron .",
    "replacing the cd bonn potential in the @xmath128 partial wave by a central one reproducing deuteron binding and , roughly , @xmath36-@xmath35 @xmath129 and @xmath130 phase shifts , leads to small but visible changes ( smaller than kd - ch difference ) in the cross sections .",
    "however , we do not consider such a @xmath36-@xmath35 potential as realistic and therefore performed another test calculation with the realistic argonne v18 potential @xcite that has a stronger tensor force and a larger deuteron @xmath24-state probability as compared to cd bonn . in this case",

    "the precise value of the quadrupole vibrational coupling @xmath98 also turns out to be irrelevant provided that spectroscopic factors are fixed that we take from shell - model calculations . at this",
    "lowest considered energy we found that the core - excitation effect can be approximated to a good accuracy ( 6% for the @xmath4 state and even better for the @xmath3 state ) by a simple reduction of the single - particle cross section according to the respective sf .",
    "thus , the extraction of the sf through the ratio of experimental data and single - particle cross section as performed in ref .",
    "@xcite is a reasonable procedure .",
    "nevertheless , our prediction for a slightly stronger reduction of the @xmath4 cross section leads to an even better agreement between the shell model sf and experimental data .",
    "the situation changes dramatically at higher energy where the core - excitation effects are much more complicated than just a reduction of the cross section according to the respective sf .",
    "thus , in this regime one really needs to perform full calculations with the core excitation and should not rely on a single - particle cross section to extract the sf .",
    "for example , we found that at 31.5 mev / nucleon beam energy the sf extracted in this naive way would be about 70% too small for the @xmath4 state but 80% too large for the @xmath3 state .",
    "this also demonstrates that core excitation acts very differently in the @xmath18 and @xmath24-wave neutron states . in the @xmath18-wave case",
    "the results are qualitatively consistent with previous findings for reactions involving the @xmath17 but based on the rotational model .",
    "taking into account also the study of the @xmath138 reaction , we are able to make an important conclusion on a systematic effect of the quadrupole core excitation at higher energies : it substantially suppresses reactions with @xmath5 transfer but enhances those with @xmath6 .",
    "the shape of the angular distribution of the differential cross section is changed in both cases .",
    "of course , the quantitative size of these effects depends on the collision , binding , and excitation energies .",
