    "cool stars with convective envelopes exhibit long - term photometric and spectroscopic variations , which indicate long - term changes of surface magnetic flux .",
    "many stars show single or multiple cycles with some irregularities , while others are characterised by relatively unchanging total radiative flux , hence they are called _ flat activity stars_. whether these stars represent grand minimum states is not yet certain .",
    "the current paradigm concerning the physics of activity cycles in cool stars is based on solar dynamo models , which incorporate the generation and transport of magnetic flux within the convection zone .",
    "there are several unknowns regarding rapidly rotating cool stars , in particular the internal rotation , flows , magnetic field geometry , and their complex interplay .",
    "therefore it is probably more appropriate to extrapolate the solar paradigm _ gradually _ towards faster rotating sun - like stars or to cooler dwarfs .",
    "we expect the dynamo strength to increase with decreasing rossby number , in parallel with the empirical rotation - activity relation .",
    "simple mean - field dynamo models suggest that the cycle period decreases as the dynamo number increases .",
    "however , recent flux transport dynamo models by @xcite have shown that , to match the observed dependence , meridional flow should either increase its strength with the rotation rate ( hereafter @xmath0 ) , which is incompatible with 3d full - sphere simulations , or have preferred patterns which are difficult to justify . as an alternative explanation for the observed relation ,",
    "@xcite have shown that turbulent pumping of magnetic flux throughout the convection zone can decrease the cycle period with increasing @xmath0 and decreasing meridional flow speed .",
    "however , it should be noted that recent mean - field models of differential rotation indicate an increase of meridional flow speed with @xmath0 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kitchatinov & olemskoy 2012 ) ) .",
    "magnetoconvection simulations in 3d of the entire stellar convection zone have been presented by @xcite , who demonstrated self - organisation of large - scale toroidal magnetic structures in the midst of the convection zone of a sun - like star .",
    "these structures turn out to be anti - symmetric around the equator , stationary for 3@xmath1 , and exhibit occasional polarity reversals for @xmath2 .",
    "we have recently presented numerical simulations combining generation , buoyant rise , and surface transport of magnetic flux in various cool star convection zone configurations ( @xcite ) .",
    "our composite models are based on a mean - field overshoot dynamo , the period of which decreases with @xmath0 . with increasing @xmath0",
    "the latitudinal distribution of the emerging flux at the surface deviates significantly from that of the dynamo waves at the base of the convection zone , owing to a poleward deflection of rising flux tubes .",
    "when the rotation period is 9  days for a sun - like star , our models indicate that the periodic dynamo in the deep convection zone can lead to a non - cyclic surface activity .",
    "the existence of such moderately active but non - cycling stars were reported by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hall & lockwood ( 2004 ) ) .",
    "a similar situation can occur for coronal x - ray cycles in some cool stars : @xcite have shown that sufficiently overlapping magnetic cycles in the surface activity can lead to the absence of x - ray cycles .    considering mean - field dynamo models ,",
    "@xcite have suggested that the dynamo must be operating in two distinct layers within the convection zone , to explain the observed poleward moving starspots in the k1-subgiant component of hr 1099 .",
    "our simulations of a k1-type subgiant star with @xmath0 and surface shear adopted from hr 1099 have demonstrated that a deep - seated stellar dynamo with a well - defined period and amplitude can co - exist with fluctuating cycles of surface magnetic flux ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* iik et al . 2011 ) ) .",
    "further analysis indicates that the short - period cycle at the surface results from the underlying dynamo , while the long - period cycle signal is caused by stochastic emergence of bipolar regions at very high latitudes , where the effects of surface transport are relatively weak ( @xcite ) .",
    "this can be an explanation for the long - term cycle in hr 1099 reported by @xcite .",
    "it is clear that we still lack a rigorous physical understanding of the relations between the emerging flux , rotation rate , convection zone structure , and cycle properties of cool stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "how does the link between a tachocline dynamo and surface transport change with rotation rate and convection zone structure , as we depart from solar parameters ? how do turbulent transport properties change with @xmath0 ?",
    "how does the dynamical disconnection of rising magnetic flux tubes vary with stellar parameters ?    such problems will remain as challenges in the future , but observations will reduce the theoretical degrees of freedom .",
    "the recent successes of the babcock - leighton type solar dynamo models in explaining various aspects of solar magnetism is encouraging for stellar modelling .",
    "based on our recent models , we conclude that the combined effects of flux generation , emergence and transport should be considered in models of stellar magnetic fields , because their interrelations are sensitive to changes in stellar parameters .",
