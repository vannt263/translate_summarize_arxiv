    "this version of ncqed differs from ordinary qed in several ways : ( @xmath21 ) the @xmath22 vertex picks up a lorentz violating phase factor given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the incoming and outgoing electron momenta ; ( @xmath26 ) the nc theory predicts trilinear and quartic couplings between the photons that are , to leading order , linear and quadratic in the parameters @xmath4 , respectively , and are kinematics dependent ; ( @xmath27 ) only the charges @xmath28 are allowed by gauge invariance in ncqed@xcite .",

    "this restriction to @xmath28 implies that we can only examine the nc effects for the handful of processes which have external charged leptons or photons .",
    "despite this limitation , ncqed provides a testing ground for the basic ideas behind nc quantum field theory and has had its phenomenological implications examined by a number of authors@xcite . as we will see , the hallmark signal at colliders for ncqed is the appearance of an azimuthally - dependent cross section in @xmath29 processes ; the azimuthal dependence arises from the existence of the two preferred directions discussed above .",

    "we assume the incoming @xmath39 direction to be along the @xmath40axis .",
    "the first process we consider is bhabha scattering which proceeds through both @xmath41 and @xmath42channel gauge boson exchanges .",

    "we find that beam polarization is not particularly useful for nc searches in bhabha scattering ; the left - right polarization asymmetry , @xmath51 , is found to be rather insensitive to nc effects showing , in particular , little azimuthal dependence .",
    "the reach for @xmath52 in this case for clic energies is also presented in figure  [ e3064_fig1 ] where we see that it is of order @xmath53 .",
    "figure  2 shows that similar results are obtained at lower energy colliders .",

    "note that , unlike bhabha scattering , mller scattering is sensitive to a finite @xmath30 . if either @xmath56 or @xmath57 is nonzero , an azimuthal dependence is seen in the cross section as displayed in fig .  3 .",
    "( note that there is no sensitivity to a nonvanishing @xmath58 . )",
    "the oscillatory behavior is somewhat more pronounced here than in bhabha scattering .",
    "again , no additional sensitivity arises from the azimuthal dependence of @xmath51 .",
    "the reach for @xmath52 from mller scattering is seen from fig .",
    "[ e3064_fig2 ] to exceed that for bhabha scattering .",
    "figure  4 shows that similar results are obtained at lower energy colliders .",
    "the last case we consider is pair annihilation .",
    "in addition to the new phases that enter the @xmath42 and @xmath54 channel amplitudes , there is now an additional @xmath41channel photon exchange graph involving the nc - generated three photon vertex discussed above .",
    "this new amplitude is proportional to the sine of the phase : @xmath59 $ ] . as in bhabha scattering",
    ", this modification to the sm result appears to lowest order as a dimension-8 operator that probes finite @xmath16 .",
    "as before , the @xmath47 distribution is modified for all values of the @xmath46 , but a nonvanishing @xmath48 and/or @xmath49 is required to produce an azimuthal dependence .",
    "the resulting angular distributions are shown in fig .  5 for the case @xmath14 . writing @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , fig .  6 displays the reach for @xmath16 for clic energies for several values of @xmath63 .    in summary",
    ", we have examined the effects of ncqed in several @xmath29 scattering processes at high energy @xmath0 colliders .",
    "we find that these effects produce an azimuthal dependence in the cross sections , providing a unique signature of the lorentz violation inherent in these theories .",
    "the search reaches for the nc scale in a variety of processes are summarized in table 1 for both @xmath64 gev and clic energies .",
    "we display the @xmath65 cl search limits on the nc scale @xmath52 from the various processes considered above at a 500 gev @xmath0 linear collider with an integrated luminosity of 500 fb@xmath1 or at a 3 or 5 tev clic with an integrated luminosity of 1 ab@xmath1 .",
    "the sensitivities are from the first two papers in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath66 and @xmath67 analyses of godfrey and doncheski include an overall @xmath68 systematic error not included by hewett , petriello and rizzo .",
