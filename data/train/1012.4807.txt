    "the quasar q2237 + 0305 was discovered in 1984 @xcite during a spectroscopic survey of nearby galaxies .",
    "the spectrum of the nucleus of the barred spiral galaxy 2237 + 0305 ( @xmath3=0.0394 ) was found to be superimposed by a quasar component at a redshift of @xmath0 = 1.695 .",
    "+ the first high resolution observations of the system showed three images of the quasar @xcite .",
    "this number was soon corrected by @xcite who first observed all four known point like quasar images around the core of the galaxy .",
    "the images are arranged in a nearly symmetric way , hence the name ` the einstein cross ' .",
    "+ spectroscopy proved that they are images of a single quasar .",
    "the images are separated by up to 1.8 from each other , and are labeled a through d. + after the prediction by @xcite and initial theoretical studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , microlensing was first detected in q2237 + 0305 @xcite .",
    "in fact , this detection of ` quasar microlensing ' was the first evidence for microlensing generally , including stellar microlensing in the galaxy which was not discovered until 1993 @xcite .",
    "today ` the einstein cross ' is one of the best studied multiply lensed quasars and there have been a lot of monitoring programs in the optical @xcite where much microlensing activity has been observed .",
    "the quasar has also been detected in the uv @xcite , the nir @xcite , the mir @xcite and the radio regime @xcite .",
    "however , there is no published light curve of q2237 + 0305 in the x - ray regime yet .",
    "+ the x - ray emission of q2237 + 0305 was first detected with _",
    "rosat / hri _ observations in 1997 @xcite .",
    "since then there have been other x - ray observations of q2237 + 0305 like a single spectroscopic observation with _ xmm - newton _ from 2002 ( data set i d : 0110960101 ; pi : watson ) @xcite and two _ chandra _ observations @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study ten archival _ chandra _ observations ranging from january 2006 until january 2007 and compile the first x - ray light curve of q2237 + 0305 .",
    "the data we use was taken by the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ @xcite in the period between january 9 , 2006 ( julian date 2453745.0 ) and january 14 , 2007 ( julian date 2454114.9)(pi : kochanek ) .",
    "the exposure time was @xmath4 8 ks per observation . in table",
    "[ datatable ] we list the ten observation ids , the exposure times and observation dates . the observation ids are listed in order to reference the individual images .",
    "we obtained the data from the chandra data archive .",
    "figure [ 6831_raw_labled ] shows all ten observations .",
    "the brightness variabilities of the four images are already visible .",
    "the four quasar images are labeled in the common way from a to d.          all ten images were obtained with the acis - s detector in _ vfaint _ mode .",
    "acis - s is one of the two detectors in the acis ( advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ) @xcite instrument . in our data set",
    "q2237 + 0305 was placed on the back - illuminated chip s3 ( 1024 @xmath5 1024 pixel ) .",
    "+ the _ vfaint _ mode provides the observer with the event position in detector coordinates , the event amplitude , the arrival time , and the pixel values in a 5@xmath55 island ( compared to the 3@xmath53 island in _ faint _ mode ) . in our case a subarray of only half of the acis - s array was used for the benefit of reducing the read - out time to 1.7 seconds avoiding pile - up effects .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]         although the light curve is only sparsely sampled it shows flux variabilities in a wide range and for each of the four quasar images .",
    "most prominent are the variations in image a and the general and very steep increase in the fluxes of all four images for the last two epochs .",
    "as we are looking at images originating from a single quasar , variations in all four images are due to processes in the quasar itself because the time - delay is expected to be of the order of a few hours only ( see below ) .",
    "however , stars in the lensing galaxy may also induce brightness variations through microlensing which hence are different for each of the quasar images . in the following we will separate both types of variability .",
    "microlensing in the optical is a well known phenomenon in q2237 + 0305 ( e.g. recent studies including @xcite ) .",
    "thus we here analyse the x - ray light curve to find evidence for x - ray microlensing in ` the einstein cross ' .",
    "+ if part of the flux variations are due to microlensing , the pairwise flux ratios of the quasar images should not be constant .",
    "we therefore have to consider that the flux @xmath6 of each image @xmath7 at time @xmath8 is a result of different factors .",
    "@xmath9     + hence the brightness is affected by :    * * @xmath10 * : the time - dependent flux of the quasar as the source of the x - ray radiation .",
    "it is the same for each quasar image .",
    "* * @xmath11 * : the magnification factor that originates from the macro lens model and its local lensing parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "it therefore depends on which quasar image we are looking at . * * @xmath14 * : the variable magnification factor due to microlensing changes with time and is different for each quasar image .",
    "we do not need to correct for time - delays between the images as they are negligible @xcite .",
    "as we are interested in microlensing we form the pairwise flux ratios between all quasar images @xmath7 and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) :    @xmath17    this way the intrinsic fluctuations of the quasar cancel out .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ ratiosixplot ] where we logarithmically plotted the pairwise flux ratios of the quasar images for every observation and according to equation ( [ ratioequation ] ) .",
    "the difference to a light curve including the macro magnification @xmath18 is just a constant offset in the logarithmic plot and is of no importance for our analysis .",
    "additionally , we also plotted the mir flux ratios @xcite , i.e. the macro magnification ratios , for each pair of quasar images .        in figure [ ratiosixplot ]",
    "we see that the ratios @xmath19 and @xmath20 show a similar variation signature ( with the exception of the first data point ) , i.e. an increasing flux ratio that has a maximum in the fith epoch and decreases afterwards .",
    "this behaviour is not mirrored by the ratio @xmath21 for these epochs , which supports the view that the maximum in the ratios @xmath19 and @xmath20 is caused by microlensing in image a. the variations of ratios @xmath22 and @xmath23 are consistent with an independent low - amplitude microlensing signal in image d when compared with the ratio @xmath21 .",
    "however , the evidence for microlensing is most prominent in image a and the ratio @xmath19 which is why we only focus on this quasar image and image ratio , respectively .    the arguments given above and the fact that the correlated variations especially in the ratio @xmath19 do not support random fluctuations as the cause , leads to the conclusion that we have observed microlensing induced variabilities .",
    "however , by comparing the observed flux ratios with the macro magnification ratios , we find that all quasar images may be affected by microlensing because their ratios are not consistent with the mir data .",
    "the flux ratios can also be affected by substructures in the lensing halo , however , due to the higher mass scale the time - scale of the variations induced by substructures is much longer ( due to the higher mass - scale ) than the time - scale considered in our analysis @xcite .",
    "focussing on the ratio of image a to image b and comparing it to ogle @xcite observations ( v - band , restframe uv ) obtained at the same time , we find that the maximum as well as the subsequent flattening of the ratio in the x - ray regime coincides with the optical observations .",
    "this is shown in figure [ a - b_ogle_xray ] where the @xmath19 ratio in the x - rays is overplotted with the ogle data .",
    "for the most prominent peak around julian date 2453937.5 , the increase since julian date 2453856.0 of the x - ray ratio a / b is larger by a factor @xmath2 compared to the signal in the optical .",
    "furthermore , also the a - b difference light curve in the uv @xcite for that period shows similar characteristics .",
    "however , the events are less distinct at uv and optical wavelengths which is exactly what we expect as the uv and the optical emitting regions are thought to be larger than the x - ray emitting region @xcite .",
    "the inset in figure [ a - b_ogle_xray ] shows theoretical light curves for two gaussian sources crossing a straight caustic .",
    "the radii are different by a factor of 6.7 .",
    "the fact that there is strong evidence for microlensing in image a and d does not explain the high flux rates for the last two epochs and the flux rate drop for the third observation as the microlensing in image a had its peak at jd 2453937.5 ( july 2006 ) .",
    "these fluctuations can only be explained by intrinsic variations of the quasar itself .",
    "x - ray variability on such short time scales of weeks indicates that the emission generation takes place in a relatively compact region and that the emission processes , that make quasars so luminous , are highly variable .",
    "such strong variations are not seen in the optical ogle light curve .",
    "merely , the minimum at jd @xmath4 2454010 can be seen .",
    "in this paper we have analysed archival _",
    "chandra _ data of the gravitationally lensed quasar q2237 + 0305 .",
    "we compiled an x - ray light curve for all four images .",
    "the data set comprises ten epochs ranging from january 2006 to january 2007 . because of the blended nature of the four images ( see figure [ 6831_raw_labled ] ) it was necessary to simultaneously fit appropriate psfs to all four images in order to obtain proper photometry .",
    "for this , we used a simulated psf which accounts for the optical properties of the _ chandra _ observatory and the spectrum of the quasar x - ray emission .",
    "the fitting was accomplished by a two - dimensional fitting algorithm and a grid search by minimising cash s c - statistic .",
    "finally we analysed the light curve and found evidence for microlensing variations in quasar image a ( see figure [ ratiosixplot ] ) . the x - ray microlensing signal in image a coincides with the signal in the optical ogle light curve . assuming that this parallel behaviour is caused by the same process , i.e. one source that is microlensed , the amplitude of the microlensing signal is a direct measure for the source size in the particular wavelength regime @xcite . as the microlensing signal in the x - ray regime is much more prominent than in the optical",
    ", this suggests that the x - ray emission region is much smaller than the optical emission region of the quasar @xcite . in a future paper ( zimmer et al .",
    "2010 , _ in prep .",
    "_ ) we will make use of this effect to measure the size of the x - ray and the optical emission region in q2237 + 0305 . while the time - delays in q2237 + 0305 are negligible the intrinsic variations have to be considered in the analysis .",
    "figure [ cashlightcurve ] clearly shows how strong these variations are in the x - ray regime .",
    "we do not find such strong fluctuations in the optical .",
    "this indicates that the mechanism powering the quasar is variable and leads to brightness variations by a factor of @xmath4 4 on time - scales of less than 30 days .",
    "we acknowledge the use of galfit 2.03 and thank the galfit team for providing an adaptable galfit source code .",
    "we also like to acknowledge the usage of the plotting package _ veusz _ and its lead author jeremy sanders .",
