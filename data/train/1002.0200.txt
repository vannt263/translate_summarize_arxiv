    "the relationship between energy and information has been investigated extensively in the context of computation energy cost including a modern analysis of maxwell s demon @xcite-@xcite . in this letter , we show a new energy - information relation from a different point of view .",
    "recently , it has been reported that energy can be transported by local operations and classical communication while retaining local energy conservation and without breaking causality @xcite-@xcite .",
    "such protocols are called quantum energy teleportation ( qet ) and are based on ground - state entanglement of many - body quantum systems including spin chains @xcite , cold trapped ions @xcite  and quantum fields @xcite . by performing a local measurement on a subsystem a of a many - body system in the ground state , information about the quantum fluctuation of a can be extracted . because the post - measurement state is not the ground state in general , some amount of energy is infused into a as qet energy input during this measurement , and the ground - state entanglement gets partially broken .",
    "next , the measurement result is announced to another subsystem b of the many - body system at a speed much faster than the diffusion velocity of the energy infused by the measurement . soon after the information arrives at b",
    ", energy can be extracted from b as qet energy output by performing a local operation on b dependent on the announced measurement data .",
    "the root of the protocols is a correlation between the measurement information of a and the quantum fluctuation of b via the ground - state entanglement .",
    "due to the correlation , we are able to estimate the quantum fluctuation of b based on the announced information from a and devise a strategy to control the fluctuation of b. by the above - mentioned selected local operation on b , the fluctuation of b can be more suppressed than that of the ground state , yielding negative energy density around b in the many - body system .",
    "the concept of negative energy density has been investigated in quantum field theory for a long time @xcite .",
    "quantum interference among total energy eigenstates can produce various states containing regions of negative energy density , although the total energy remains nonnegative .",
    "the regions of negative energy density can appear in general many - body quantum systems by fixing the origin of the energy density such that the expectational value vanishes for the ground state . in spite of the emergence of negative energy density",
    ",  the total energy also remains nonnegative for the general cases . in the qet protocols , during the generation of negative energy density at b , surplus positive energy",
    "is transferred from b to external systems and can be harnessed as the qet output energy . here",
    "it should be emphasized that this output energy existed not at a but at b _ even _ _ before _ the start of the protocol and was hidden inside the zero - point fluctuation of b. of course , this zero - point energy is not available by usual local operations for b. however , by using a local operation dependent on a s information , it becomes possible to dig out b s zero - point energy by pair creation of the positive output energy from b and the negative energy of b. hence , we do not need to hire any physical carrier of energy from a to b like electric currents and photons , at least , during short - time qet processes .",
    "needless to say , after the completion of qet process , the positive energy of a compensates for the negative energy of b during late - time free evolution of the many - body system .",
    "the amount of output energy from b is upper bounded by the amount of input energy to a.    using the usual protocols of quantum teleportation , quantum states can be transported from one party to another by the consumption of shared entanglement between the two parties @xcite . as is well known @xcite , transfer of a large number of quantum states",
    "requires a large amount of consumption of shared entanglement as a physical resource . taking into account the fact",
    ", it seems natural for the qet protocols to expect that a large amount of teleported energy also requests a large amount of consumption of the ground - state entanglement between a and b. if such a non - trivial relation exists between teleported energy and breaking of ground - state entanglement by measurement , the relation may shed new light on the interplay between quantum physics and quantum information theory . in this letter , the first example of the energy - entanglement relation for a minimal qet model",
    "is presented .",
    "the minimal qet model is the smallest physical system for which non - trivial qet can be implemented ; this model consists of two qubits with an interaction of the ising spin chain in the presence of a transverse magnetic field .",
    "we explicitly show that for the minimal model , the consumption of entanglement between a and b during the measurement of a is lower bounded by a positive value that is proportional to the maximum amount of energy teleported from a to b. in addition , we obtain another inequality in which the maximum amount of energy teleported from a to b is lower bounded by a different positive value that is proportional to the amount of entanglement breaking between a and b by the measurement of a. these energy - entanglement inequalities are of importance because they help in gaining a profound understanding of entanglement itself as a physical resource by relating entanglement to energy as an evident physical resource .",
    "first of all , we introduce the minimal qet model .",
    "the system consists of two qubits a and b. its hamiltonian is the same as that of the ising spin chain in the presence of a transverse magnetic field as follows : @xmath0 , where each contribution is given by @xmath1 and @xmath2 and@xmath3 are positive constants with energy dimensions , @xmath4 is the x - component of the pauli operators for the qubit a ( b ) , and @xmath5 is the z - component for the qubit a ( b ) .",
    "the constant terms in eqs .",
    "( [ 1])-([3 ] ) are added in order to make the expectational value of each operator zero for the ground state @xmath6 : @xmath7 because the lowest eigenvalue of the total hamiltonian @xmath8 is zero , @xmath8 is a nonnegative operator:@xmath9 .",
    "meanwhile , it should be noticed that @xmath10 has a negative eigenvalue , which can yield negative energy density .",
    "the ground state is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the eigenstate of @xmath5 with eigenvalue @xmath13 .",
    "when local operations are performed to this system , we connect the system with a local appratus and ( or ) add local external forces like magnetic field .",
    "however , time interval of the operations is assumed to be quite short , as often argued in quantum information theory .",
    "thus interaction terms between the system and the external apparatus vanish in the hamiltonian after the short - time operation .",
    "let @xmath14 denote a set of povm measurements @xcite for a which measurement operators @xmath15 with measurement output @xmath16 commute with the interaction hamiltonian @xmath17 .",
    "the measurement operator @xmath15 takes the form of @xmath18 the coefficients @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are real constants which satisfy @xmath23 the povm corresponding to @xmath15 is defined by @xmath24 which satisfies the completeness relation , @xmath25 by introducing the emergence probability @xmath26 of output @xmath16 for the ground state and a real parameter @xmath27 , the povm is written as follows : @xmath28 by taking suitable values of @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , all values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 are permissible as long as they satisfy @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the post - measurement state of the two qubits with output @xmath16 is given by @xmath32 this measurement excites the system and the average post - measurement state has a positive expectational value @xmath33 of @xmath8 , which energy distribution is localized at a. in fact , the value defined by @xmath34 is computed as @xmath35 this infused energy @xmath33 is regarded as the qet energy input via the measurement of a. during the measurement , @xmath33 is transfered from external systems including the measurement device with a battery respecting local energy conservation .",
    "the qet energy conservation law during local measurements to a qubit of a spin chain has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the key feature of this model is that any measurement of @xmath14 does not increase the average energy of b at all . by explicit calculations , the average values of the hamiltonian contributions @xmath10 and",
    "@xmath17 are found to remain zero after the measurement and are the same as those of the ground state .",
    "this measurement does not yield instantaneous change of @xmath17 .",
    "therefore we have no direct force of a affecting b after the measurement .",
    "thus , we can not extract energy from b by the standard way soon after the measurement .",
    "in fact , if any local unitary operation @xmath36 independent of a s measurement result is performed to b , the post - operation state @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 the energy difference after the operation is calculated as @xmath39   -e_{a}=\\langle g|w_{b}^{\\dag } \\left (   h_{b}+v\\right )   w_{b}|g\\rangle,\\label{e01}\\ ] ] where we have used @xmath40@xmath41   = 0,\\ ] ] and the completeness relation of the povms:@xmath42 from eq .",
