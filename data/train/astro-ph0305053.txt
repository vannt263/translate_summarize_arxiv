    "the cherenkov light emitted in atmosphere by ultrarelativistic electrons of extensive air showers ( eas ) of cosmic rays ( crs ) carries the important information on the primary energy and shower development in atmosphere . at the yakutsk array air cherenkov light measurements",
    "are used to estimate the primary energy in the model independent manner , and the lateral distribution form of the light on the ground is used to infer the position of shower maximum in atmosphere , @xmath0  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we have derived the energy spectrum of cosmic rays in the range @xmath1 to @xmath2 pev using the independent measurement technique via air cherenkov light and compared it with our previous spectrum obtained with eas charged particle measurements as well as the results of other giant arrays .",
    "during more than 30 years of lifetime the yakutsk array is detecting muonic , electronic and cherenkov light components of eas .",
    "the actual detector arrangement of the array is shown ( fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] ) .",
    "open circles are charged particle detectors given as the background here . filled",
    "circles show the cherenkov light detectors - open photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) of 176 @xmath3 and 530 @xmath3 acceptance area , forming a medium subarray .",
    "filled squares indicate pmts of autonomous subarray with independent trigger .",
    "this subarray was added in 1995 with the aim to study air showers in the energy range @xmath4 ev via the cherenkov light measurements .    during @xmath5 hours of observation in moonless nights there",
    "were detected @xmath6 showers of energy above @xmath7 ev by the medium array .",
    "they were selected using the double trigger condition : i ) three or more scintillator stations have detected the charged particle density above the threshold 1 particle / m@xmath8 ; ii ) the cherenkov light intensities in three or more pmts are greater than @xmath9 photons / m@xmath8 depending on the acceptance area of pmt .",
    "the autonomous array data consist of @xmath10 showers with @xmath11 ev detected during @xmath12 hours of observation .",
    "the cherenkov trigger condition only is used to select these showers .    for absolute calibration of pmts",
    "the cherenkov radiation of relativistic particles in distilled water was used  @xcite .",
    "the variations in cosmic ray intensity measured with cherenkov detectors itself are used to monitor the atmospheric transparency  @xcite .",
    "the detector arrangement of the yakutsk array .",
    "a description of the points is given in the text . ]",
    "we have summarized our lateral distribution function ( ldf ) measurements of the cherenkov light intensities in fig .  [",
    "fig : ldf ] . the data of both subarrays ( zenith angle @xmath13",
    ") are parameterized by the light intensity at 150 m from the shower core , q@xmath14 , the only core distance really present in the shifting range of measurements when the primary energy is rising from @xmath15 to 10@xmath16 ev .",
    "the data are consistent with the previous results of the yakutsk array concerning the cherenkov light and can be described by the suitable eas model simulation  @xcite .",
    "there s seen no abrupt change of ldf parameters , so we choose rather smooth approximation curve to fit the experimental data in the whole energy range :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 m ; @xmath19 m ; @xmath20     air cherenkov light radial distributions .",
    "our experimental data are given by the points .",
    "the curves are approximations along equation  [ eq.ldf ] for given q@xmath14 . ]",
    "the total flux , q@xmath21 , of the cherenkov light emitted by the shower in atmosphere is used to estimate the primary energy .",
    "the detector design of the yakutsk array is appropriate to measure q@xmath21 in the range above about @xmath22 m@xmath23(table  [ tab : table1 ] ) .",
    "the authors are grateful to russian ministry of science and technology for the support of the yakutsk array under the program # 01 - 30 unique research facilities in russia. our special thanks to the yakutsk group members who made the essential contributions to data acquisition and analysis .",
