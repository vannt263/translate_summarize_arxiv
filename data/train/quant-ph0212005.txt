    "since the first recognition of the advantages of ion traps for quantum computing @xcite , various proposals to achieve quantum gates between pairs of trapped ions have been put forward  @xcite . in all cases each ion stores one or more qubits in its internal state , and",
    "most proposals have envisaged two or more ions in the same harmonic well , with the joint motional degree of freedom ( normal mode of oscillation ) serving as a further carrier of quantum information , which can be coupled to any chosen ion by laser excitation  @xcite .",
    "more recently a  method of a qualitatively different form was proposed , in which the ions need not be in the same harmonic well , and a quantum gate is achieved through a more direct use of the coulomb repulsion between ions @xcite .",
    "two ions in neighbouring harmonic wells are pushed by a force which depends on their internal state .",
    "therefore , their mean separation depends on their internal state while the force acts .",
    "it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the phase acquired from the coulomb energy has the form of single - qubit rotations combined with the controlled - phase gate @xmath1 .",
    "this `` pushing gate '' is significant for three reasons .",
    "first , it was shown  @xcite that in the right conditions the gate is unusually insensitive to the details of the motion of the  ions , i.e. the quantum phases depend primarily on the  mean positions of the ions , and are insensitive , for example , to the ion temperature .",
    "secondly , the gate can be faster than those previously proposed .",
    "thirdly , the fact that the gate can act on ions in separate wells is useful for scaling the computer up to large numbers of ions , because it is possible to move the ions around without ever having to `` tease apart '' two ions which were initially in the same well",
    ".    for these reasons the `` pushing gate '' is a promising idea , but various aspects were left unclear in work up till now , as follows .",
    "\\(i ) the method generates single - qubit rotations simultaneously with the desired two - qubit phase gate . in the  original work",
    "@xcite it was assumed that these rotations would be unproblematic , since they are known from the  experimental parameters and can be undone afterwards , if so desired , by any available single - qubit gate method .",
    "therefore , the explicit calculation of these phases was not carried out . however ,",
    "if the rotation angles are large compared to @xmath0 they will be sensitive to experimental imprecision .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to calculate them and if possible , find ways to suppress or compensate for them .",
    "\\(ii ) a state - dependent pushing force was introduced without analysing in sufficient detail the physical mechanism which gives rise to the force .",
    "\\(iii ) the proposal assumed that the force is independent of position , and it was unclear to what extent the  good behaviour of the gate relied on that assumption .",
    "\\(iv ) the effect of imprecision or fluctuations in the  parameters was not considered .",
    "the reason it is important to clarify these points is that until this is done , it is not clear whether the good performance of the gate is genuine , or whether it is an  artifact of some unphysical assumption , such as an unreasonably high laser intensity or an unreasonably high precision in parameters",
    ". this paper will address the points just listed .    in sec .",
    "[ gc ] we introduce the basic concept of a generalised phase gate in order to bring out the physics without reference to any specific physical system . we also examine the double @xmath0-pulse `` spin - echo '' which was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite as a way to improve the fidelity .",
    "the `` spin - echo '' is used to cancel a  correlated error which might be large , so there is a danger that a  small imprecision in this part of the evolution might result in a  large loss of fidelity .",
    "therefore , we examine the influence of imprecision in the  @xmath0  pulses .    in sec .  [ ions ] we introduce the ion trap system .",
    "first , we show how the gate works in a qualitative way , and then we write down the hamiltonian and deduce the  classical trajectories of the ions under the influence of the  two trapping potentials , their coulomb repulsion , and the  state - selective and time - dependent pushing force which is , for this section , assumed to be independent of position .    sec .",
    "[ dp ] then obtains all the quantum phases which arise in the evolution in the semiclassical approximation , where the trajectories are classical and the quantum phase is obtained from a path integral along the  classical trajectory .",
    "our main purpose is to obtain the  single - qubit rotation phases which were not calculated in the  original paper @xcite . in order to make",
    "the treatment self - contained we also rederive the two - qubit phase which is the central feature of the gate .",
    "[ force ] considers an explicit choice for the pushing force .",
    "the most natural choice is the dipole force from a  non - resonant laser beam .",
    "this has the unavoidable consequence that unwanted scattering of photons will occur , which reduces the fidelity .",
    "we calculate the photon scattering and hence the loss of fidelity .    in sec .",
    "[ fluct ] we examine the influence of fluctuations in the laser intensity .",
    "this is important because the single - qubit phases introduced by the gate are large , so that in some parameter regimes small changes in laser intensity can cause single - qubit rotations much larger than  @xmath0 , destroying the fidelity .",
    "we propose a way to largely circumvent this problem by appropriately choosing the  directions of the forces and the distance scale of the potential energy function ( e.g. ac stark light shifts ) , which provides the force .    in sec .",
    "[ non - uni ] we examine the effect of position dependence of the force , which is a major constraint on the  temperature of the ions .",
    "it is also non - negligible since tightly focused laser beams , or a laser standing wave , must be used to get sufficient dipole force without unreasonably high laser power .    in sec .",
    "[ infid ] we consider the total fidelity of the gate , including the effects of imperfect  @xmath0  pulses , photon scattering , positional dependence of the force , and non - zero temperature of the ions .",
    "we give example values for the calcium ion , and discuss the results in comparison to other gate methods in ion traps .",
    "in this section we shall introduce a general concept of a  two - qubit phase gate .",
    "we discuss the fidelity of the  phase gate and also the fidelity of the gate incorporating a double @xmath0-pulse or `` spin - echo '' method to cancel one source of infidelity .",
    "finally , we treat the latter case with imperfect @xmath0 pulses .",

    "the  two - qubit phase gate with the  phase @xmath13 is equivalent ( up to additional single - qubit rotations ) to a two - qubit controlled - not ( cnot ) gate , which together with single - qubit rotations forms a universal set of gates for quantum computation @xcite .      in practice for a particular physical system the phases @xmath4 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) are not accurately known and they may vary from one realisation of the gate to another . on the  other hand , we can assume the single - qubit rotations  ( [ gc5 ] ) are applied with a very high accuracy . a good choice for the phases @xmath4 in eq .",

    "01  |_01 , + _ 10  |_10 , & _ 11  |_11 .",

    "the precision of the gate is limited by the degree to which @xmath2 is not perfectly predictable from one realisation of the gate to another , owing to technical noise and the finite temperature of the  trapped ions .      in order to calculate the fidelity of the phase gate we have to compare an  output state of a  perfect gate and an  actual gate .",
    "we will define the fidelity as follows [ gc12 ] f= |_perf|_act|^2 , where the perfect state is produced by the perfect phase gate  ( [ gc2 ] ) for @xmath13 , giving [ gc - perf ] |_perf= p_|_0 , while the actual state follows from the actual gate given by the  transformation  ( [ gc10 ] ) , that is [ gc - act ] |_act= sg|_0 .",

    "the 1995 proposal of cirac and zoller  @xcite required ground state cooling @xmath350 and required the  gate rate  @xmath24 to be small compared to @xmath351 , where @xmath352 is the lamb - dicke parameter  @xcite .",
    "the work of mlmer and srensen @xcite and others has revealed methods which allow the  requirement on cooling to be relaxed to @xmath353 .",
    "the `` pushing gate '' , by contrast , allows a fast gate rate @xmath354 , with simultaneously high temperature .",
    "the standing - wave configuration places the stronger constraint on temperature , but even for this case the lamb - dicke condition @xmath355 is sufficient .",
    "the examples with @xmath311 and @xmath312 show that the gate could be demonstrated with modest requirements on the laser beam power and size . a trap separation below approximately @xmath356",

    "the same laser parameters with the standing - wave configuration would allow a gate time of @xmath361 at infidelity @xmath362 .    in the longer term it would be desirable to have a  system consisting of a large number ( @xmath363 ) of trap pairs , with many gate operations performed simultaneously .",
    "with trap separations of the order of micrometres and a  gate rate of order 10mhz , the infidelity of order @xmath364 would be available if the laser intensity noise were small enough . however reducing",
    "the total laser power may become an important consideration for a large processor .",
    "the main results of this paper are :    \\(i ) the single - qubit rotations have contributions from the coulomb repulsion , the light ( ac  stark ) shift , the  trapping potential , and the kinetic energy . when the  parameter regime is such that the two - qubit phase is insensitive to ion temperature , then the coulomb contribution to the single - qubit phases is much larger than @xmath0 ( @xmath365 ) and proportional to the size of the pushing force . this is dangerous because it implies that laser intensity fluctuations just of the order of @xmath366 could be sufficient to destroy the fidelity .",
    "\\(ii ) the dipole force was introduced .",
    "it is found that the number @xmath220 of scattered photons during the gate varies as @xmath367 for wavelength @xmath199 and laser power @xmath196 for a laser beam focused such that the waist size is proportional to the wavelength .",

    "the infidelity associated with photon scattering increases with the trap separation @xmath82 and the trapping frequency @xmath92 , while the infidelity associated with finite ion temperature falls with @xmath82 and @xmath92 .",

    "\\(iii ) a lack of spatial uniformity in the pushing force is found to be a significant consideration when the distance scale ( @xmath191 or @xmath208 ) of the force profile is smaller than the separation @xmath82 of the ions . in this situation ,",
    "the effect of a  finite temperature of the ions is primarily to cause fluctuations in the size of the force they experience , and hence fluctuations in the phase of the  gate .",

    "\\(iv ) using the @xmath0-pulse method ( `` spin - echo '' ) , we find that a given infidelity ( @xmath295 or @xmath61 ) in the @xmath0 pulses simply reduces the overall fidelity by approximately @xmath295 or @xmath61 .",
    "an equivalent error occurs if a parameter of the pushing gate changes slightly between two successive applications . the most likely source of such fluctuations is laser intensity noise .",
    "it is shown that the single - qubit phases can be made first order insensitive to laser intensity noise , by choosing the distance scale ( `` sweet spot '' ) of the laser intensity gradient so that the ac  stark light shift balances the contribution from coulomb repulsion .",
    "this greatly reduces the requirement on laser intensity stability , indeed in practical terms it may make the difference between a feasible gate and an unfeasible one .    to conclude overall",
    ", the analysis of the points summarized above was necessary to assess the `` pushing gate '' , and to gain insight into its physical mechanism .",
    "the  analysis which has been presented is sufficiently complete to describe an experimental realisation .",
    "even though it  was found that the fidelity of the gate will not be as high as was originally predicted , it still performs well in that ( i ) it does not require ground state cooling and ( ii ) with sufficient laser power neither is cooling to the lamb - dicke limit required , while the gate time can be close to the inverse of trap vibrational frequency , making it a fast gate in comparison with others which have been proposed for ion traps .",
