    "wormholes ( whs ) are hypothetical short topological tunnels connecting two different distant asymptotically flat regions of the universe , or such regions belonging to different universes in the model of the multiverse @xcite .",
    "they are typical relativistic objects .",
    "the problem of wormholes has a long history . in the framework of general relativity ,",
    "first attempts to construct such objects were performed by flamm @xcite and einstein and rozen @xcite .",
    "later on , many theoretical aspects of the wh problem were investigated , see , for example @xcite . during the last few decades ,",
    "interest in wormholes increased in connection with the early universe @xcite and various problems in physics and astrophysics @xcite .    in the works",
    "@xcite the hypothesis that some known astrophysical objects ( e.g. quasars and active nuclei of some galaxies ) could be entrances to wormholes was considered .",
    "wormholes may have existed as primordial objects in early stage of the expanding universe @xcite .",
    "it is possible that such primordial wormholes could be preserved after the end of the inflation @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis can explain some observable facts in astrophysics and can predict new phenomena @xcite .",
    "in the middle of the last century it was shown in general relativity that a vacuum wh pinches so quickly that it can not be traversed even by a test signal moving with the velocity of light ( see review in @xcite ) . in order to prevent the shrinking of a wh and to make it traversable ,",
    "it is necessary to thread its throat with so - called exotic matter which is matter that violates the averaged null energy conditions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "different types of wormholes may exist depending on the type of exotic matter in their throats @xcite .",
    "for example it could be a `` magnetic exotic matter '' in which the main component is a strong ordered magnetic field plus a some amount of a `` true exotic matter '' @xcite .",
    "another type is a `` scalar exotic matter '' in the form of a scalar field with a negative energy density @xcite .",
    "one more type is a mixture ; `` magnetic - negative dust exotic matter '' which is a mixture of an ordered magnetic field and dust ( matter with zero pressure ) with negative matter density @xcite .",
    "the physical properties of different types of whs are different .",
    "whs with scalar exotic matter were the subject of very intense investigations both analytically and numerically .",
    "possible dynamics of such whs has been analyzed analytically for example in papers @xcite . the most important , however , was the numerical analysis @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the static whs of this type are unstable .",
    "perturbations trigger the evolution of the wh and the evolution of the exotic scalar field which maintains it . as a result ,",
    "the wh either collapses or expands . in the case of the collapse - a black hole ( bh )",
    "if the collapsing wh has both the exotic scalar field and the magnetic field , the structure of the singularity inside the resulting bh requires special investigation .",
    "the reason for extra attention is that the magnetic field in whs or their remnants has special manifestation in the astrophysical observations in the hypothesis of the existence of whs in the universe @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to analyze ( under simplifying assumptions ) the nature of the singularity created during the collapse of the wh with the exotic scalar field and with the magnetic field .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we describe a model in the framework of which we analyze the problem . in the subsection [ sec : model_equations ]",

    "[ sec : model_leadorderqne0 ] we use the leading order analysis for the case with the magnetic field . in the subsection",
    "[ sec : model_numericalanalysisepsless0 ] the numerical analysis is applied to the case with the magnetic field . in the section [ sec : conclusions ]",
    "we discuss the results .",
    "we consider collapse of a wh with the formation of a bh .",
    "the main feature inside a bh is its space - time singularity .",
    "our goal is to investigate the nature of this singularity , using some simplifying assumption .",
    "first , we consider the spherical wh and bh nonlinearly perturbed by a minimally coupled and self - gravitating massless exotic scalar field @xmath0 with the negative energy density @xmath3",
    ". we will also consider the same case but with an additional radial magnetic field .",
    "it was shown ( see @xcite ) that , in the considered model , in the close vicinity of a space - like singularity of a bh , all processes , as a rule , have high temporal gradient ( much higher than the spatial gradients along the singularity ) and that the processes depend on the properties of a very restricted space region .",
    "it follows from here that , for clarification of some physical processes , one can use a homogenous approximation and that all processes and geometry depend on the time coordinate only .",
    "we assume also that in the close vicinity of a time - like singularity of a bh one can use a homogenous approximation also , but now all processes and geometry depend on the radial space coordinate only .",
    "we start with the general homogeneous spherically symmetric line element : @xmath4 @xmath5 inside a bh the region between the event horizon ( eh ) and the cauchi horizon ( which exists in the case with the radial magnetic field ; we will call it ( ) ) is so - called @xmath6-region ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in this region",

    "are given by : @xmath17 where the constant @xmath18 characterizes the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "the exotic scalar field @xmath0 is governed by the klein - gordon equation @xmath19 (; denotes the covariant derivative ) , whose first integral reads @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a constant and @xmath22 is the metric determinant . for the exotic field ,",

    "substitution of ( [ eq:6 ] , [ eq:8 ] - [ eq:12 ] ) into ( [ eq:3 ] ) , ( [ eq:4 ] ) enables us to find the unknown functions @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",

    "let us consider the leading order terms in a series expansion for the metric functions and the leading order terms in the einstein equations ( [ eq:3 ] ) , ( [ eq:4 ] ) , @xmath37 near the singularity @xmath38 .",

    "we demand also that the corresponding terms in the einstein equations ( [ eq:3 ] ) , ( [ eq:4 ] ) tend to zero when @xmath42 , otherwise this method does nt work ( see appendix [ append ] ) . in the vicinity of @xmath38 the solution of ( [ eq:3 ] ) , ( [ eq:4 ] )",

    "these constants have direct physical meaning in the case of empty ( without @xmath0 field ) bh , when .",

    ", @xmath47 determines the strength of this field .",

    "@xmath47 are essential physical parameters , and @xmath46 is a gauge parameter . using the arguments which are analogous to the arguments of burko @xcite one may conclude that the dependence on two physical and one gauge parameter means that the solution is generic . if we suppose that in the solution ( [ eq:13 ] ) , ( [ eq:14 ] ) @xmath57 , @xmath58 , then it means that @xmath59 , @xmath60 ; @xmath8 is the time coordinate and @xmath7 is the space coordinate . in this case",
    "@xmath38 is a time - like singularity .",
    "probably it corresponds to negative mass of the object and a naked singularity .",

    "we will represent the results for the case of the exotic scalar field @xmath0 with @xmath61 , and compare them with the results for the case of the ordinary scalar field @xmath2 with @xmath62 .",
    "for the latter case @xmath2-field with @xmath62 , we consider also the case of the presence of the magnetic field @xmath63 to emphasize the essential difference the cases @xmath37 and @xmath64 .",
    "we start the computation from @xmath65 , and set @xmath66 , @xmath67 equal to their values at @xmath34 for the zero matter content schwarzschild ( or reisner - nordstrm if @xmath63 ) solution with initial @xmath68 and @xmath69 if @xmath63 . here",
    "@xmath70 is the value of the event horizon for the zero matter content bh with the same parameters .",
    "we consider several values of @xmath32 , which is the characteristic of the initial amplitude of the scalar field .",
    "the parameters of the model , including the exponent @xmath47 , depend on the value of the scalar field @xmath32 .",
    "we start from the extremely small amplitude @xmath71 and consider the cases ( see figure [ fig:1 ] ) : @xmath72 in figure [ fig:1a ] one can see the propagation ( @xmath7 vs. @xmath8 ) of the incoming signal with the velocity @xmath73 ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "figure [ fig:1b ] shows the mass function ( see @xcite ) : @xmath74 figure [ fig:1c ] presents the evolution of the metric functions , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and figure [ fig:1d ] shows the evolution of the values @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "it is clear from the results shown in figures that for this extremely small amplitude @xmath71 in the case @xmath37 the propagation of the light - like signal , evolution of @xmath39 and @xmath40 and and are practically the same for and the difference is not visible in the plots .    on the other hand , the behavior of the mass function for the cases @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( figure [ fig:1a ] ) is quite different",
    "of course the reason for this is the opposite signs of @xmath79 for these two cases .",
    "the physical processes which can lead to a nonlinear change of the mass function are the following :    * the mass @xmath45 inside a sphere can change because of the work of pressure forces on the surface of the sphere , * the mass can change due to the mass inflation @xcite .",
    "both processes are described in @xcite .",
    "the process * b ) * is important near the in the case of presence of the magnetic field @xmath63 and @xmath80 . in the case",
    "@xmath37 does not exist .",
    "thus in the case @xmath37 the process * b ) * is not important , and variations of mass function is small and opposite for the two cases @xmath77 and @xmath78 .    the case of @xmath77",
    ", @xmath69 is quite different .",
    "figure [ fig:1a ] shows that in this case the light - like signal goes close to the initial value of @xmath7 for the horizon @xmath81 during a long period , and only after that it comes to @xmath38 ( beyond the framework of the figure ) .",
    "note that the light - like signal does not cross the @xmath82 horizon .",
    "the horizon itself shrinks down to @xmath38 under the focusing effect , as it is described in @xcite .",
    "the metric functions @xmath39 and @xmath40 go to zero very fast , and very large asymptotic values @xmath83 and @xmath84 are clearly seen in figure [ fig:1d ] . when the solution is close to @xmath81 the mass inflation manifests itself ( see figure [ fig:1b ] ) , the mass function increases dramatically .",
    "we next study the solutions for the larger values of @xmath71 .",
    "we start with the case @xmath85 and consider the following values ( see figure [ fig:2 ] ) : @xmath86    the propagation of the light - like signal ( figure [ fig:2a ] ) qualitatively is the same for all cases but for larger values of @xmath32 it comes to @xmath38 later .",
    "behavior of the metric functions , figures [ fig:2b][fig:2c ] , is interesting .",
    "the analysis of the leading order terms of the series expansion for the case @xmath62 ( this means that @xmath87 ) leads to the conclusion that @xmath88 , but @xmath47 can be positive and negative .",
    "numerical analysis shows that for rather small @xmath89 the function @xmath39 increases when @xmath42 , but for the larger @xmath90 the function @xmath91 decreases when @xmath42 ( see also table [ table:1 ] ) .",

    "the value @xmath99 where @xmath100 also increases monotonically when @xmath32 varies from @xmath101 when @xmath102 to @xmath103 when @xmath97 .",
    "the sign of @xmath104 never changes .",
    "the difference in behavior of the metric functions leads to difference in the properties of the mass function . as we mentioned above , in the case",
    "@xmath37 the horizon does not exist and the mass inflation ( the process * b ) * ) is not important for the evolution of the mass function .",
    "thus , the process * a ) * , which is related to the deformation of the volume of the reference frame , plays the main role .",
    "the longitude deformation is proportional to @xmath105 , while the transversal deformations are proportional to @xmath106 . in all cases it leads to the increase of the mass with decrease of @xmath7 . for large positive @xmath47 corresponding to large @xmath32",
    "this increase is very fast .",
    "we now turn to the discussion of the case @xmath61 , ( see figure [ fig:3 ] ) , which corresponds to the case of the collapse of the whs analyzed numerically in @xcite . here in the limit @xmath42",

    "dropping the absolute value , the limit varies from at to at the behavior of the metric functions @xmath39 , @xmath40 is similar for all cases @xmath108 , see figures    the light - like signal comes to @xmath38 later for the larger values of @xmath71 , see figure [ fig:3c ] .",
    "this property is opposite to the case of @xmath85 .",
    "the changes of the mass function @xmath45 for the cases @xmath109 and @xmath110 are also insignificant ( see figure [ fig:3d ] ) , in sharp contrast with the case @xmath85 .",

    "an assumption of @xmath112 makes the term with the magnetic field @xmath113 to be negligible , and the analysis near @xmath42 becomes the same as for the cases considered in the section [ sec : model_leadorderq=0 ] .",
    "however , one of our conclusions in section [ sec : model_leadorderq=0 ] was that @xmath114 ( [ eq:17 ] )",
    ". thus our current assumption of @xmath115 contradicts the result expressed in ( [ eq:17 ] ) .",
    "the case @xmath116 also leads to contradictions .",
    "we come to a conclusion that the only allowed values for @xmath47 are negative values , @xmath117 , which means that in the vicinity of @xmath38 we can neglect the scalar field and consider @xmath118 , @xmath119 .    to the leading order ( [ eq:3 ] ) , ( [ eq:4 ] )",

    "this is well known the reissner - nordstrm solution in the vicinity of @xmath38 .",
    "arbitrariness of the coefficient @xmath126 is related to the arbitrariness of the choice of the @xmath8 coordinate .",
    "note that now @xmath128 and @xmath129 , this means that @xmath8 is the time coordinate , @xmath7 is the space coordinate , we are in the @xmath130-region , see @xcite , and @xmath38 is a time - like singularity .",
    "we start with the case @xmath69 , @xmath78 and @xmath65 .",
    "this case differs from those discussed in section [ sec : model_numericalanalysis ] by the sign of @xmath32 only .",
    "the change of sign on @xmath32 greatly influences the physics of the processes taking place . in the case with @xmath85 the nonlinear effects of mass inflation and focusing of the horizon down to @xmath38 arized . as a result , both functions @xmath131 and @xmath39 finally come to zero at @xmath38 , and the space - like singularity arized ( see figure [ fig:1 ] ) in the @xmath6-region ( see @xcite ) . in our current case of @xmath61 there are no mass inflation and other such effects , and one can observe quite different behavior ( see figure [ fig:4 ] ) .",
    "the question is , can the collapsing configuration cross the border between the @xmath6-region ( as in figure [ fig:4 ] ) and @xmath130-region and come to an internal @xmath130-region ? to arrive to an answer , one needs to perform a deeper analysis and numerical calculations for the general case when @xmath40 and @xmath39 depend on both @xmath7 and @xmath8 coordinates . for now",

    "@xmath38 one can use an approximation where the solution depends only on one coordinate @xmath7 ( the so - called uniform approximation ) . in this region , it is possible to consider the leading order terms in a series expansion for the metric functions and the leading order terms in the einstein equations .",

    "there is the special interest in the case of the exotic scalar field @xmath0 together with the magnetic field @xmath1 . as it was mentioned in the introduction ( [ sec : intro ] ) , the magnetic field in the whs or their remnants has a special manifestation in astrophysical observations if the whs really exist in the universe .    from the leading order analysis for this case we concluded",
    "that in the vicinity of @xmath38 , @xmath47 is negative and the magnetic field dominates the scalar field , and the metric functions correspond to the reissner - nordstrm solution .",
    "thus the singularity at @xmath38 is in the @xmath130-region and is a time - like singularity in the case of our assumptions .",
    "numerical estimates demonstrate that the asymptotic behavior of the metric functions practically do not depend on the initial value of the exotic scalar field .",
    "we have investigated also the properties of the mass - function for all cases .",
    "we want to emphasize the principal difference between the collapse of the ordinary scalar field @xmath2 with @xmath85 and the magnetic field @xmath1 , and the collapse of the exotic scalar field @xmath0 with @xmath138 and the magnetic field @xmath1 . in the case of the @xmath2-field the collapse leads to the formation of the space - like singularity @xmath38 in the @xmath6-region , but in the case of the @xmath0-field",
