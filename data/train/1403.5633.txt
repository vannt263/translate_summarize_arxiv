    "recently , the ideas of braneworld and brane induced gravity @xcite@xcite attracts much attention in wide areas of physics such as particle physics , field theory , superstring theory and cosmology . in the previous paper @xcite",
    ", we inquired their dynamical foundations and established the precise formulations for a rather limited setup of the flat bulk .",
    "we fixed imperfections in the naive old formalism .",
    "for example , the induced gravity terms are proportional to the number of the extra dimensions , but not to that of whole spacetime .",
    "we showed that the induced effects depend also on the extrinsic curvature and the normal - connection gauge field , and derived the precise expressions .",
    "delicate situations for the cosmological - constant problem were discussed .",
    "things were much simplified due to the flatness of bulk . in this paper , we extend the formulation to the fully general case of the curved bulk .",
    "it will turn out that we can incorporate the bulk curvature effects in a systematic way , as far as the small fluctuations are concerned .",
    "the induced effects depend also on the bulk curvature components at the brane , in addition to the extrinsic curvature and the normal - connection gauge field .",
    "general relativity is based on the premises that the spacetime is curved affected by matter according to the einstein equation , and that the objects move along the spacetime geodesics .",
    "the gravitations are apparent phenomena of the inertial motions in the curved spacetime .",
    "this successfully explains why the motion in the  gravitational \" field is universal , i.e. blind to the object properties ( mass , charge etc . ) , and why the newton s law of gravitation holds in daily familiar gravitational phenomena .",
    "the general relativity is supported by further precise observations such as perihelion precessions of planets , light bending due to massive stars etc .. it raises , however , another fundamental question why the spacetime is curved so as the einstein equation indicates .",
    "it is supposed by sakharov in 1967 that the quantum effects of the spacetime itself may provide the origin of the gravity with the einstein equation @xcite .",
    "field theoretical formulations were developed to realize the einstein gravity as quantum effects of the matters @xcite@xcite . in these theories , the gravitational field , i. e.",
    "spacetime metric appears as a composite of the matters .    on the other hand , the composite pictures of matters achieved great successes in wide areas of physics , including molecules , atoms , atomic nuclei , hadrons and various quasi - particles in quantum systems .",
    "field theoretical treatments of particle compositeness have been explored extensively . according to feynman rules , scattering amplitudes have a pole due to a particle in its energy variable at its mass .",
    "if a pole appears in some energy channel through some mechanism without a corresponding particle field in the original setup , it indicates existence of a composite particle formed by the mechanism .",
    "for example , contact interactions of fermions are known to give rise to a composite pole through chain diagrams , when we fix the momentum cut off at a large but finite level @xcite .",
    "some degrees of freedom at the short distances are converted into those of the collective modes .",
    "such a composite is also successfully described by introducing an auxiliary field .",
    "if we eliminate the auxiliary field by using the constraint from the euler equation in the original setup , we have a system described only with constituents .",
    "its kinetic term is supplied through quantum loop diagrams .",
    "the methods are applied to , for example , superconductivity , models of hadrons , induced gauge theories @xcite , and models of composite quarks , leptons , gauge bosons , and higgs bosons @xcite . in renormalization theories ( with large but finite momentum cut off ) , vanishing of the wave - function renormalization constant of some field implies absence of the kinetic term of the field in the original setup , despite its presence after renormalization .",
    "then , the field is interpreted as a composite @xcite .",
    "vanishing of renormalization constants is called as compositeness condition .",
    "these methods have been extensively studied @xcite and widely applied in condensed - matter , nuclear , and particle physics .",
    "the field theoretical formulations of the induced gravity @xcite is developed in the context of the unified composite model @xcite . in the original setup ,",
    "the system is described only with matter fields with the assumption of general coordinate invariance . or , equivalently , it is described with metric field which lacks the kinetic term , and is taken as an auxiliary field without independent degree of freedom .",
    "the kinetic term of the metric , i.  e.  the einstein - hilbert action , is induced via quantum loop diagrams , and the metric acquires the independent degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , the metric is interpreted as the composite of the matters , and the origin of the gravitational phenomena is traced back to the quantum nature of the matters .",
    "unfortunately , we can only partially apply the renormalization theory arguments because the general relativity is not renormalizable .",
    "the simplest model of matters with general - coordinate invariance is that of scalar fields with the nambu - goto action @xcite .",
    "then , the scalar fields can be interpreted as the position coordinate of our spcetime in a spacetime with higher dimensions .",
    "note that the spacetime itself is taken as a matter , which may induce quantum effects including gravity .",
    "this interpretation lead us to the ideas of the braneworld and the brane induced gravity @xcite , @xcite , @xcite@xcite .",
    "these ideas have been studied extensively in these three decades .",
    "physical models were constructed with topological defects in higher dimensional spacetime @xcite@xcite , and they were realized as ",
    "d - branes \" in the superstring theory @xcite@xcite .",
    "they were applied to the hierarchy problem with large extra dimensions , or with warped extra dimensions @xcite , @xcite@xcite .",
    "it was argued that the brane induced gravity would imply various interesting consequencs @xcite@xcite .",
    "the ideas have been studied in wide areas including basic formalism , @xcite@xcite , brane induced gravity @xcite@xcite , particle physics phenenomenology @xcite@xcite , and cosmology @xcite@xcite .    in this paper , we explore a precise formalism to derive the expressions for the quantum induced effects on the brane embedded in a curved bulk . for definiteness",
    ", we follow the simplest model of the braneworld with the nambu - goto dynamics .",
    "we do not specify dynamics of the bulk gravity , since it is irrelevant to the short distance effects at the brane .",
    "we treat the bulk curvature only as a given external field . to define the brane fluctuations invariantly",
    ", we introduce a geodesic measure ( riemannian coordinate ) for the normal subspace to the braneworld .",
    "then , we work out the quantum effects for the small fluctuation using the methods developed in the previous paper",
    ". it will turn out that we can systematically incorporate the effects of bulk curvature , and that the induced effects depend also on the bulk curvature components at the brane , as well as on the extrinsic curvature and the normal - connection gauge field .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows .",
    "first , we define the model ( sec .  [ model ] ) , and then we derive the quantum effects ( secs .",
    "[ fluctuations][calculation ] ) .",
    "we define the brane fluctuations ( sec .",
    "[ fluctuations ] ) , formulate the quantum effects ( sec .  [ quantum ] ) , specify the method to regularize the divergences ( sec .  [ cutoff ] ) , classify the possible induced terms according to symmetries ( sec .  [ classification ] ) , and calculate them via feynman diagram method ( sec .  [ calculation ] ) .",
    "the final section ( sec .  [ conclusion ] ) is devoted to conclusion and discussions .",
    "the cosmological terms are fine - tuned , and the einstein like gravity and other terms are induced .",
    "we consider a quantum theoretical braneworld described by the nambu - goto lagrangian @xcite .",
    "we will see the quantum effects of the brane fluctuations give rise to effective braneworld gravity @xcite , @xcite , @xcite@xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 @xmath1 be the position of our three - brane in the @xmath2 dimensional spacetime ( bulk ) , parameterized by the brane coordinate @xmath3 @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 indicate the time components .",
    "let @xmath7 be the bulk metric tensor at the bulk point @xmath8 .",
    "this is taken to obey some bulk gravity theory .",
    "then we consider a braneworld with dynamics given by the nambu - goto lagrangian ( density ) : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a constant .",
    "or we write it as @xmath11 } }   \\label{ngab}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with abbreviations @xmath12 } = \\det g^{[x]}_{\\mu\\nu}$ ] , and @xmath13 } _ { \\mu\\nu } = x^i_{\\ , \\mu } x^j_{\\ , \\nu } g_{ij}(x^k ) ,     \\label{gmunux}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where ( and hereafter ) indices following a comma ( , ) indicate differentiation with respect to the corresponding coordinate component , and @xmath14}$ ] is attached to remind that they are abbreviations for expressions written in terms of @xmath15 .",
    "the tensor @xmath16}_{\\mu\\nu}$ ] is the induced metric on the brane with ( [ gmunux ] ) .",
    "we assume that @xmath15 appears nowhere other than in @xmath17 in the total lagrangian @xmath18 including the bulk lagrangian .",
    "the equation of motion from ( [ ng ] ) is given by @xmath19 } { } ^{\\mu\\nu } x ^{[x]}_{;\\mu\\nu } { } ^i = 0 ,    \\label{ngem}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20}_{;\\mu\\nu } { } ^i $ ] is the double covariant derivative with respect to both of the general coordinate transformations on the brane and to those in the bulk : @xmath21}_{;\\mu\\nu } { } ^i = x^i_{\\ , \\mu\\nu }      -x^i_{\\ , \\lambda } \\gamma^{[x]}{}^\\lambda_{\\mu\\nu }      + x^j_{\\ , \\mu } x^k_{\\ , \\nu}\\gamma^i_{jk } \\label{x[x];munu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the affine connections on the brane and bulk @xmath22}{}^\\lambda_{\\mu\\nu }      & = & \\frac{1}{2 } g^{[x ] } { } ^{\\lambda \\rho}\\left (      g ^{[x]}_{\\rho\\mu,\\nu}+ g^{[x]}_{\\rho\\nu,\\mu}- g^{[x ] } _ { \\mu\\nu,\\rho }      \\right ) , \\\\      \\gamma^i_{jk }      & = & \\frac{1}{2 } g^{il}\\left (      g_{lj , k}+ g_{lk , j}- g_{jk , l }      \\right ) , \\label{gammabulk}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively .",
    "the system is invariant under the general coordinate transformation of the bulk and the brane separately . under these symmetries",
    ", we can also have terms dependent on the curvature tensor written with @xmath23 } _ { \\mu\\nu}$ ] .",
    "they would , however , be suppressed for small curvatures as our exiting spacetime .",
    "therefore we concentrate on the case where the lagrangian is dominated by the simplest form ( [ ng ] ) .",
    "we expect that this gives a good approximation at low curvature limit in many dynamical models of the braneworld ( e.g. topological defects @xcite@xcite , spacetime singularities @xcite , @xcite@xcite , d - branes @xcite@xcite , etc . ) .",
    "it is remarkable that , as we shall see below , this simple model exhibits brane gravity and gauge theory like structure through the quantum effects .",
    "for convenience of quantum treatments , we consider the following equivalent lagrangian to ( [ ng ] ) : @xmath24    \\label{ng'}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is an auxiliary field , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the inverse matrix of @xmath25 .",
    "note that @xmath25 , unlike @xmath12}_{\\mu\\nu}$ ] above , is treated as a field independent of @xmath15 .",
    "then the euler lagrange equations with respect to @xmath15 and @xmath25 are given by @xmath28 respectively , where the covariant derivative @xmath29 is written in terms of the brane affine connection @xmath30 with respect to the auxiliary field @xmath25 .",
    "now @xmath25 in ( [ ngem ] ) is independent of @xmath15 , and , instead , we have an extra equation ( [ gmunu ] ) , which guarantees that @xmath25 is the induced metric .",
    "if we substitute ( [ gmunu ] ) into ( [ ngem ] ) , we obtain the same equation as ( [ ngem ] ) . thus the systems with the lagrangians @xmath17 and @xmath31 coincide . furthermore the argument that their dirac bracket algebrae coincide @xcite indicates their quantum theoretical equivalence .",
    "we proceed hereafter based on the lagrangian @xmath31 instead of @xmath17 .",
    "in order to extract the quantum effects of @xmath31 , we deploy a semi - classical method , where we consider those due to small fluctuations of the brane around some classical solution ( say @xmath32 ) for @xmath0 of the equation of motion ( [ ngem ] ) @xcite .",
    "namely , the solution @xmath32 obeys the classical equation @xmath33 in quantum treatment , @xmath15 itself in the lagrangian @xmath31 does not necessarily obey the equation of motion ( [ ngem ] ) , and may fluctuate from @xmath32 . among the fluctuations , only those transverse to the brane are physically meaningful , because those along the brane remain within the brane and cause no real fluctuations of the brane .",
    "they are absorbed by general coordinate transformations . in order to describe them ,",
    "we choose @xmath34 independent normal vectors @xmath35 @xmath36 at each point on the brane with the orthogonality condition @xmath37 we can arbitrarily choose a orthonormal system with @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the kronecker delta .",
    "then , we have the completeness relation of the vectors , @xmath40 throughout this paper , latin capital sufficies @xmath41 indicate bulk coordinate indices running over the range @xmath42 , greek lower case sufficies @xmath43 indicate brane coordinate indices running over the range @xmath44 , and latin lower case sufficies @xmath45 indicate extra - dimensional coordinate indices running over the range @xmath46 .",
    "bulk coordinate indices @xmath47 are raised and lowered by the metric tensors @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "we can read off from ( [ ng ] ) and ( [ gmunu ] ) that the auxiliary field @xmath25 plays the role the metric tensor on the brane . on the brane",

    ", we assumed that the bulk is flat , and we defined the fluctuation measure @xmath54 with @xmath55 in this paper , we want to consider general cases where the bulk is also curved .",
    "then , the definition of the fluctuation measure @xmath54 with ( [ x = y+prev ] ) is inappropriate , because it relies on the coordinate system of @xmath15 , and lacks the general - coordinate invariance of the bulk .",
    "we define the invariant measure @xmath56 for quantum fluctuations of the brane as follows .",
    "suppose that the geodesic curve in the direction of a normal unit vector @xmath57 of the solution brane @xmath58 hits the fluctuated brane @xmath15 at a distance @xmath59 .",
    "then , @xmath60 is the coefficients of the expansion of @xmath61 in terms of @xmath62 : @xmath63 the position @xmath15 of the fluctuated brane is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 stands for terms of o(@xmath66 ) and the higher , and recursively given by solving the geodesic equation @xcite .",
    "the higher terms of o(@xmath66 ) are unnecessary for our present purpose . if we take @xmath60 as independent variables but not functions of @xmath3 , eq .  ( [ x = y+ ] ) gives the transformation from the coordinate system @xmath67 to @xmath15 . the former is called  riemannian coordinate system \" . in the far regions off the brane in comparison with the scale of the brane curvature ,",
    "this coordinate system may encounter singularities and multi - definitions .",
    "it causes , however , no problem , since only small fluctuations are necessary for our purpose .",
    "the higher terms in @xmath60 , however , may cause another problem in practical calculation of the quantum contributions .",
    "they give rise to the higher terms in @xmath60 in @xmath31 , and hence the higher loop diagrams , which we have no systematic way to evaluate .",
    "in fact we do not even know how such large fluctuations contribute to the quantum effects .",
    "here we restricts to retain the contributions only from the small fluctuations of the brane , and neglect the terms of o(@xmath68 ) and the higher in @xmath31 .",
    "accordingly , we are to evaluate only the one - loop diagrams .    now we substitute ( [ x = y+ ] ) into the lagrangian ( [ ng ] ) . for our purpose , it is sufficient to retain explicit forms for terms up to o@xmath69",
