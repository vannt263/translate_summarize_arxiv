    "<S> conclusion. _ we have numerically observed signatures of an enstrophy cascade in decaying 2dqt , including a @xmath1 power - law spectrum , constant enstrophy flux over a wide inertial range , and a kraichnan - batchelor constant converging to @xmath4 for large vortex number . we have shown that the extent of the inertial range scales as @xmath5 for a suitably - defined superfluid reynolds number , @xmath0 , that depends only on the number of vortices and the length scale where kinetic energy is initially concentrated . </S>",
    "<S> the relevance of the classical cascade theory for describing decaying 2dqt suggests an underlying universality of decaying turbulence phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> signatures of the enstrophy cascade become observable for systems of a few hundred vortices , and may soon be within reach of cold - atom 2dqt experiments .    </S>",
