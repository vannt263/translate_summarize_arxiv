    "[ intr ]    a very useful microscopic model for the study of black holes @xcite has been the d1d5 conformal field theory ( cft ) @xcite .",
    "one makes a bound state of d1 and d5 branes , and the cft emerges as a description of the low energy dynamics of this bound state .",
    "while this cft is complicated in general , it has been conjectured that there is a point in its moduli space of couplings where it becomes particularly simple . at this orbifold point",
    "the theory is described by a sigma model whose target space is a symmetric orbifold @xcite .",
    "at the orbifold point , the cft is free ; using this free theory enables us to extend the strominger - vafa computation @xcite from extremal to near - extremal black holes @xcite .",
    "such couplings do not describe the point in moduli space where the dual gravity theory is weakly coupled , giving the supergravity approximation . in order to work towards describing interesting gravity processes such as black hole formation , one therefore needs to turn on an exactly marginal deformation operator in the cft , which deforms the theory by ` blowing up ' the orbifold singularities of the target space .",
    "the deformation operator is built out of a twist operator of the orbifold theory dressed with a supercharge @xcite .",
    "it is interesting and important to study the effect of this deformation operator @xmath4 on states of the cft @xcite .",
    "@xcite described the effect of @xmath4 on the ramond vacuum , and on states containing one or two initial quanta .",
    "@xcite considered transitions between different ramond vacua via absorption and emission of chiral primaries ; processes involving the change of angular momentum by @xmath5 units were found to be suppressed as @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite took a different tack , studying the computation of anomalous dimensions at first order in conformal perturbation theory for low - lying string states in the cft and operator mixing .",
    "@xcite studied the effect of @xmath4 for bosonic fields , when the twist links together winding numbers @xmath7 and @xmath8 to winding number @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite looked at the effect of @xmath4 in the limit when excitation wavelengths are short compared to the gap .",
    "the method of @xcite also allows handling fermions .",
    "overall , it was found that the twist involved in the deformation operator converts the vacuum into a squeezed state , with a schematic form @xmath10 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath11 in the above squeezed state are given by closed form expressions , but the derivation of these expressions was somewhat lengthy .",
    "in the present paper we find a much more direct way of obtaining @xmath11 . in our new method",
    ", we consider the ope of the stress tensor @xmath12 with the deformation operator @xmath13 .",
    "the conformal ward identity relates this ope to a derivative @xmath14 .",
    "we then find that this derivative has a simple expression , and performing an integral then gives the @xmath15 .",
    "this derivation also gives insight into the structure of these coefficients : they are seen to be given by an integral of an expression that is a product of factors , one depending only on @xmath16 and the other depending only on @xmath17 .",
    "one may consider a continuum limit where @xmath18 ; this corresponds to looking at wavelengths much shorter than the ` box size ' set by the circle on which the d1d5 cft lives ( see figure [ contlimitbb ] ) .",
    "we obtain the expression of the squeezed state in this limit , by recasting the @xmath11 as position space kernels ; thus the squeezed state is written in terms of 2-point correlations of fields generated after the twist .",
    "the product structure in the derivatives of @xmath19 and @xmath20 mentioned earlier becomes a product structure for the position space kernel found in the continuum limit : the kernel @xmath21 becomes a product of two terms , one depending only on @xmath22 and one depending only on @xmath23 .",
    "we organize the paper as follows .",
    "first we summarize earlier work in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we consider the action of the stress tensor to re - derive the form of the squeezed state using the conformal ward identity . finally in section 4 , we compute the continuum limit of the squeezed state , expressing it in terms of a position space kernel . in section 5",
    "we comment on the utility of the stress - tensor method and on the form of the squeezed state .",
    "in this section we review some facts about the d1d5 cft and summarize some results from @xcite .",
    "we compactify iib string theory as @xmath24 . wrapping @xmath25 d1 branes on @xmath26 and @xmath27 d5 branes on @xmath28",
    ", we get a bound state that is described at low energy by the d1d5 cft .",
    "it is believed that there is an orbifold point in the moduli space of couplings where the cft is given by a sigma model with target space the symmetric product of @xmath29 copies of @xmath30 @xcite . at this point",
    "the cft is given by @xmath29 copies of a @xmath31 cft containing 4 free bosons and 4 free fermions .",
    "the fact that we have a symmetric product in the target space implies that we get twist sectors where different copies of the @xmath31 cft get twisted together to make a @xmath31 cft living on a longer circle .",
    "the cft has @xmath32 supersymmetry ; we list the algebra generators and their commutators in appendix [ appa ] .",
    "the @xmath33 superalgebra contains a @xmath34 current algebra under which the fermions form doublets , labelled by an index @xmath35 .",
    "( this doublet structure is described in eqs .",
    "( [ aaone]),([aatwo ] ) . )",
    "the four bosons are grouped into representations of the @xmath36 symmetry group of the @xmath30 ; the doublets under these two @xmath34 groups are labelled by indices @xmath37 ( eq . ( [ aathree ] ) ) .",
    "we consider the euclidean theory for which the base space is a cylinder with coordinates @xmath38 and @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we deform the cft off the orbifold point by the operators [ fullstate ] o_ab(w_0)=_2^++(w_0 ) .",
    "the operator @xmath42 is a twist which links together two copies of the cft at the point @xmath43 ; the @xmath44 superscript indicates that it carries a charge @xmath45 under the @xmath34 contained in the superalgebra .",
    "@xmath46 is the supercurrent .",
    "the left and right moving parts of all operators and states are decoupled in our computations and thus in what follows we will write only the left movers .",
    "the d1d5 bound state as constructed above gives fermions that are periodic around the @xmath26 , so they are in the ramond sector .",
    "we can map ramond sector states to ns sector states by spectral flow , which is a symmetry that changes dimensions and charges as follows @xcite h=h+j + ,   j=j+ [ spectral ] while the operators themselves change as t=t - j+ ,  j^3=j^3- ( thus we get @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) .",
    "the transformations of the stress - energy tensor and the @xmath49-current under the spectral flow have been explicitly derived in appendix [ appb ] .    in @xcite the situation in figure ( [ 2-twist ] ) was studied .",
    "we start with two copies of the @xmath31 cft , each on a singly wound circle .",
    "the twist @xmath50 joins these copies into one copy of the @xmath31 cft living on a doubly wound circle .",
    "the twist operator is inserted at the point @xmath51 on the cylinder .",
    "the ramond sector ground states are doublets under @xmath34 , and we choose the initial state |0_r^-^(1)|0_r^-^(2 ) which has spin @xmath52 for each copy .",
    "the twist @xmath50 is normalized so that _ 2^+(w_0)|0_r^-^(1)|0_r^-^(2)=|0_r^-+  where @xmath53 is the ( normalised ) negative charge ramond ground state of the cft on the doubly wound circle .",
    "we first expand the modes of bosonic and fermionic fields on the cylinder .",
    "for @xmath54 , _",
    "i.e. _ below the twist insertion , these modes are given by ^(i)_aa , n&= & _ = 0 ^ 2 _ w x^(i)_aa(w ) e^nw dw ,  i=1,2 [ lone ] + d^(i)a_n&= & _ = 0 ^ 2 ^(i)a(w ) e^nw dw ,  i=1,2 [ loneqq ] and their ( anti-)commutation relations are & = & -_ab_ab^ij m _ m+n,0 , + \\ { d^(i)a_m , d^(j)b_n}&=&-^^ab^ij_m+n,0 . above the twist insertion ( @xmath55 ) the cft lives on a doubly twisted circle and the boson and fermion modes are _ aa , n&= & _ = 0 ^ 4 _ w x_aa(w ) e^w dw , [ qaone ] + d^a_n&= & _ = 0 ^ 4 ^a(w ) e^ w dw .",

    "we briefly describe the process below :    ( @xmath57 ) the first step is to perform a spectral flow on the cylinder ( [ spectral ] ) with parameter @xmath58 .",
