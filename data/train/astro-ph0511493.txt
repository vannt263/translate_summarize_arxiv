    "within our milky way , x - ray binaries have been used as a background through which to observe the 542ev absorption edge produced by photoionization of the inner k - shell electrons of oxygen @xcite . for the first time",
    ", we attempt to extend this type of x - ray absorption study to external galaxies through the use of ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) .",
    "we analyzed epic mos and pn data from the _ xmm - newton _",
    "archive for 14 bright ulx sources .",
    "we required the x - ray spectra to have atleast 5000counts for this study .",
    "a majority of the sources were examined in winter , mushotzky , & reynolds ( submitted to apj ) , where the sources were fitted with simple absorbed blackbody and power law models . in this study",
    ", we fit all of the sources with a base model of the _ grad _ model ( general relativistic multi - component disk ) with a power law .",
    "we used the @xcite abundances and absorption models ( _ tbabs _ and _ tbvarabs _ ) .",
    "the _ tbabs _ absorption model was set to the galactic value as obtained from the nh ftool in heasarc , in order to account for galactic absorption .",
    "we allowed the hydrogen column density , oxygen abundance , and iron abundance to remain free parameters within the _ tbvarabs _ model .",
    "as in baumgartner & mushotzky ( submitted to apj ) , we found that the oxygen absorption values from the three epic detectors yielded different values .",
    "thus , we followed the procedure of baumgartner & mushotzky ( submitted to apj ) in adding an _ edge _ model to account for the differences .",
    "we added an extra edge component to the mos1 and mos2 detectors at an energy of 0.53kev with optical depths of 0.22 and 0.20 respectively .",
    "the sources and spectral fit parameters will be available in winter , mushotzky , & reynolds ( in preparation ) .",
    "we compared column densities obtained from the x - ray spectral fits with hi column densities for holmberg ii x-1 , ngc 4559 x-7 .",
    "ngc 4559 x-10 , ngc 5204 x-1 ( courtesy the whisp catalog ; swaters et al .",
    "2002 ) and ngc 247 x-1 , m81 x-1 , and holmberg ix x-1 ( braun 1995 ) .",
    "these are represented as circles in figure 1 .",
    "we also compare our values with columns obtained from the e@xmath1 values for m33 x-8 @xcite and m81 x-1 @xcite using the relationship derived by @xcite : n@xmath2@xmath3 e@xmath1 .",
    "these are represented as triangles .",
    "the x - ray values correspond to the alternate measurements , with the exception of m81 x-1 . for this source",
    "the x - ray column is greater , indicating the possibility of extra absorption surrounding the source .",
    "this result is interesting considering that the x - ray measured column densities are along a direct line of sight to the ulxs while the hi measurements are an average over a larger beam area .",
    "the agreement between the two measurements implies that the ulx sources lie within roughly normal areas of the galaxy ( i.e. not in regions of higher column density such as a molecular cloud ) .",
    "we compare the oxygen abundance values obtained from the x - ray spectral fits with those from studies of hii regions in figure 2 .",
    "the circles are a comparison with a study by @xcite ( p - method ) .",
    "their method was based on spectrophotometric studies of hii regions in the host galaxies .",
    "we include with the circle symbols the o / h value obtained by @xcite for holmberg ix x-1 from an optical study of the surrounding hii region as well as the o / h value for ngc 1313 ( 8.4 ) obtained separately by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the triangle symbols represent a comparison with values obtained by @xcite using an alternate method ( r23-calibration method ) .",
    "our values are in better agreement with those of @xcite .",
    "we found that the ratio of fe / h to o / h obtained through the x - ray spectral modeling ( tbvarabs ) was roughly the solar value . the iron abundance ( from the iron l - shell edge located at 851kev ) was less well - constrained than the oxygen abundance .",
    "for the sources with greater number of counts ( @xmath4 20000counts ) and thus better constraints on abundances , the values for iron and oxygen do not deviate significantly from solar values .",
    "the values o / h and fe / h correspond to : o / h = 12 + log(o@xmath50.00049 ) ; fe / h = 12 + log(fe@xmath6 ) , where o and fe are the abundances derived from the spectral fits using the wilms solar values .",
