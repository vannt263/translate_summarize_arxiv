    "a new calculation @xcite of the galactic interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) consistent with multi - wavelength observations by dirbe and firas indicates that the energy density of the isrf is higher , particularly in the inner galaxy , than previously thought .",
    "this has implications for the inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of electrons and positrons and other electromagnetic processes in the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "another place where the enhanced isrf may play a role is the ic emission off very high energy ( vhe ) electrons accelerated in a supernova remnant ( snr ) shock .",
    "snrs are believed to be the primary sources of cosmic rays in the galaxy .",
    "observations of x - ray @xcite and @xmath0-ray  emission @xcite from snr shocks reveal the presence of energetic particles , thus testifying to efficient acceleration processes .",
    "acceleration of particles in collisionless shocks is a matter of intensive research in conjunction with the problem of cosmic ray origin @xcite .",
    "current models include nonlinear effects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and treat particle acceleration using hydrodynamic codes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the predicted spectrum of accelerated particles has a power - law form in rigidity with index which may slightly vary around @xmath2 .",
    "conventional estimates put the maximum reachable particle energy ( protons ) at or just below the knee energy ; for the case of electrons the maximum energy is lower due to the synchrotron and ic energy losses @xcite .",
    "young snrs may be capable of particle acceleration up to @xmath3 ev due to the effect of magnetic field amplification @xcite around the shock and assuming bohm diffusion and a sedov expansion law .",
    "the vhe @xmath0-ray  emission from shell - type snrs has been modelled using leptonic ( ic ) and hadronic ( @xmath1-decay ) scenarios ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the leptonic scenario fits the broad - band spectrum of a snr assuming a pool of accelerated electrons scattered off the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) producing vhe @xmath0-rays  while the magnetic field and electron spectrum cut - off are tuned to fit the radio and x - ray data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the hadronic model fits the vhe @xmath0-rayspectrum assuming a beam of accelerated protons hits a target , such as a nearby molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "the latter , if definitively proven , would be the first experimental evidence of proton acceleration in snrs . while there is no clear distinction between different models of vhe emission from snrs",
    ", some authors tend to prefer the hadronic scenario since it fits better the observed spectral shape @xcite .",
    "such a preference , however , is made based on a simplified `` one - zone '' model which typically includes cmb photons only .    in this paper",
    "we evaluate the effect of the isrf on the ic emission of electrons accelerated in snrs located at different distances from the galactic centre ( gc ) .",
    "as examples , we apply our calculations to the shell - type snr rx j1713.7 - 3946 and composite snr g0.9 + 0.1 recently observed by hess @xcite .",
    "the galactic isrf calculation uses a model for the distribution of stars in the galaxy , a model for the dust distribution and properties , and a treatment of scattering , absorption , and subsequent reemission of the stellar light by the dust .",
    "a brief description of our calculation is available in @xcite ; we re - iterate the main points here . our stellar model assumes a type classification based on that used in the sky model of @xcite , with modifications to account for results from recent experiments such as 2mass , sdss , and others ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and synthetic spectral modelling studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "dust is modelled with a mixture of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , graphite , and silicate .",
    "the dust grains are spherical and we include details of their absorption and scattering efficiencies , abundances , and size distribution in the scattering and heating calculations @xcite .",
    "stochastic and equilibrium heating of the dust grains is treated following @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the dust is assumed to follow the galactic gas distribution and metallicity gradient ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",

    "information on the calculation method , spatial and spectral distribution in the galactic plane , and a brief comparison of our calculations with previous results and the locally observed isrf are given in @xcite ; further discussion of the new isrf is deferred to a forthcoming paper ( porter & strong , in preparation ) .",
    "for an assumed isotropic isrf and electron distribution , the ic emissivity ( photons @xmath9 s@xmath10 ) is given by @xmath11    where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the dimensionless @xmath0-ray  and target photon energy , @xmath14 is the electron lorentz factor , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the differential target photon and electron number densities , and @xmath17 is given by eq.(9 ) in @xcite . to illustrate the effect of different electron spectral indices on the ic emission , we take an electron number density @xmath18 normalised so that @xmath19 @xmath9 with @xmath20 for @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the calculated ic emissivity using the isrf at @xmath24 ( upper ) and @xmath7 ( lower ) in the galactic plane .",
    "there are two essential effects that contribute to produce the total emission curves in fig .",
    "first , the variation in the electron spectral index @xmath25 increases the contribution by optical and infra - red ( ir ) photons to the @xmath0-ray  emission below @xmath26 gev and @xmath27 tev , respectively . as @xmath28 increases",
    ", the number of low energy electrons increases ; the ic scattering rate by these electrons off optical and ir photons becomes larger giving more upscattered photons . in turn , as the @xmath0-ray  energy increases , the contribution by the optical and ir photons to the total emissivity decreases from the reduction of the scattering cross - section in the klein - nishina ( kn ) regime .",
    "thus , softer electron spectra promote more efficient scattering of the optical and ir components , increasing their relative contributions .",
    "second , the density of optical and ir photons varies with position in the galaxy . toward the gc ,",
    "the optical photon density is high , almost an order of magnitude larger per target photon energy interval when compared with the optical component at @xmath7 kpc .",
    "similarly , over the inner galaxy the ir photon energy density is significantly higher than the cmb .",
    "this gives a contribution by the optical and ir photons to the total ic emission that is at least comparable to the cmb over these regions of the galaxy .",
    "kpc ( top ) and @xmath7 kpc ( bottom ) .",
    "line styles : solid line , total ; dashed , optical ; dot - dashed , infra - red ; dotted , cmb . for each panel , top - most line - sets correspond to @xmath29 , middle line - sets correspond to @xmath30 and bottom - most correspond to @xmath31 electron spectra respectively.,width=307 ]     kpc ( top ) and @xmath7 kpc ( bottom ) .",

    "[ fig2 ] is due to the reduction of the scattering cross - section in the kn regime , as described above , and not due to any cut - off we have introduced in the electron spectrum ; if a cut - off was included in the electron spectrum , it would further decrease the contribution from the cmb relative to the optical and ir components ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] ) .    to illustrate the effect of the isrf in a purely leptonic scenario",
    ", we calculate the synchrotron and ic emission using a one - zone model @xcite for the snr rxj1713.7 - 3946 .",

    "the cut - off in the ic emission for the ir in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is only partially due to the kn effect since the electron spectral cut - off energy is essentially lower .",
    "this effect plays an important role for a snr close to the gc where the isrf is dominant . in this case , the cut - off energy of the vhe @xmath0-ray  spectrum becomes universal and defined exclusively by the reduction of the scattering cross - section and not by an assumed electron spectral cut - off .",
    "note also , for energies higher than @xmath59 tev , the intrinsic spectrum will be further reduced by attenuation due to pair production on the isrf itself @xcite .",
    "we have evaluated the effect of the isrf on the ic emission of electrons accelerated in snrs .",
    "our calculation shows that for a snr located in the inner galaxy the contribution of optical and ir photons to the ic emission exceeds the contribution of the cmb and in some cases broadens the resultant @xmath0-ray  spectrum .",
    "snrs located close to the gc exhibit a `` universal '' cut - off at vhes due to the kn effect and not due to a cut - off in the electron spectrum .",

    "it is possible to fit the observed flux spectrum with a reasonable combination of model parameters .",
    "observations in the gev to sub - tev range by the glast experiment will be critical in distinguishing between leptonic or hadronic scenarios of @xmath0-rayproduction in snrs as the predictions for the spectral shape in this energy range are distinctly different .",
    "finally , we point out at least two cases for the leptonic model where the contribution of the isrf will be critical .",
    "first will be when fitting the synchrotron peak dictates a relatively _ low - energy _ cut - off in the electron spectrum . in this case , the vhe @xmath0-rays  will be produced by lower - energy electrons scattered off optical and ir photons .",
    "second will be when fitting the synchrotron peak dictates a _ high - energy _ cut - off in the electron spectrum .",
    "an equal or exceeding contribution of optical and ir protons , but with lower energy cut - off in the spectrum of upscattered @xmath0-rays  due to the kn effect , will effectively broaden the ic peak .",
    "observations of the tev emission from snrs in the inner galaxy may thus serve as a probe of the isrf near their location . in turn",
    ", observations of shell - type snrs in the outer galaxy where the cmb photons will provide the majority of the ic emission may be used to evaluate the spectrum of accelerated electrons in the shell and for studies of shock acceleration .",
