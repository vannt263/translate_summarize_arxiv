    "in this section , we shall introduce branching random walks , which are a class of stochastic processes appearing in many different branches of science , and in particular in particle physics .",
    "we show how a nonlinear diffusion equation called the fkpp equation characterizes some properties of the realizations of branching random walks .",
    "we start by recalling some elementary facts on ordinary brownian motion , before adding in the branching process .",
    "consider a one - dimensional lattice indexed by the variable @xmath0 , with lattice spacing @xmath1 .",
    "we start with a single particle at site 0 .",
    "we take the following rule for the evolution of the system from time @xmath2 to time @xmath3 , which consists in two elementary processes : the particle has the probability @xmath4 to jump on the lattice site to the left , and the probability @xmath4 to jump to the right .",
    "hence by probability conservation , the particle has the probability @xmath5 to stay at its current position ( from which we see that @xmath4 has to be chosen less than @xmath6 ) .     definition of the elementary processes and illustration of one step of the brownian motion on the lattice .",
    "the particle sits at position @xmath0 at time @xmath2 . according to the evolution rules ,",
    "it may jump left with probability @xmath4 , right also with probability @xmath4 , and it may stay at @xmath0 with probability @xmath5 . in the particular realization shown in the figure ,",
    "the particle jumps right , in such a way that its position be @xmath7 at time @xmath3 . ]    with this rule , it is straightforward to establish an equation for the probability @xmath8 that the particle be on site @xmath0 at time @xmath2 : we simply relate @xmath9 at time @xmath3 to @xmath9 at time @xmath2 with the help of the probabilities of the elementary processes .",
    "the different terms which contribute to @xmath10 stem from the following cases :    a.   the particle is at site @xmath11 at time @xmath2 and makes a right jump .",
    "this generates the term @xmath12 ; b.   the particle is at @xmath7 at @xmath2 and makes a left jump .",
    "the corresponding term reads @xmath13 ; c.   the particle is already at @xmath0 at time @xmath2 and does not move . the term which describes this case is @xmath14 .",
    "summing all contributions , one arrives at p(x , t+t)=p(x - x , t)+p(x+x , t)+p(x , t)(1 - 2 ) from which , after a trivial rearrangement , we get the finite difference evolution equation p(x , t+t)-p(x , t)=. [ eq : finitediff ] it is often easier to deal analytically with differential equations rather than difference equations .",
    "if we let the lattice spacing @xmath1 and the time step @xmath15 go to zero , the above finite - difference equation becomes a partial differential equation .",
    "we must be careful however to keep the ratio d finite and fixed when taking this limit in such a way that no relevant terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : finitediff ] ) vanish .",
    "we get = d. [ eq : diffusion ] this equation is the so - called fokker - planck equation for our process , and we recognize that it is the simple diffusion equation . to set up a well - posed problem , we need to specify the initial condition and the boundary conditions .",
    "the initial condition is a single particle at site @xmath16 at time @xmath17 , hence in the continuous limit p(x , t=0)=(x ) . as for the boundary conditions",
    ", we shall first opt for free ones , and second impose a fixed absorptive boundary . in the following",
    ", we shall set @xmath18 for simplicity .",
    "( from dimensional analysis , one may always re - establish a general diffusion constant ) .",
    "realizations of this model are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : plotrw ] .",
    "first , we choose free boundary conditions .",
    "a general solution to eq .",
    "( [ eq : diffusion ] ) is easily obtained as a superposition of exponentials , p(x , t)=__0-i^_0+i e^-xp(,t ) .",
    "[ eq : mellin ] from eq .",
    "( [ eq : diffusion ] ) , @xmath21 obeys the ordinary first - order differential equation = ^2 p(,t ) , with the initial condition @xmath22 .",
    "the solution is trivial : p(,t)=e^^2 t. one then inserts this expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mellin ] ) in order to compute @xmath8 : p(x , t)=__0-i^_0+i e^-x+^2 t = e^-__0-i^_0+i e^t(-)^2 . performing the change of variable @xmath23 and sliding the integration contour in such a way that @xmath24",
    ", we are left with a standard gaussian integral p(x , t)= _ -^+e^-^2 .",
    "finally , p(x , t)=e^- .",
    "[ eq : solutiondiffusion ] this function ( of @xmath0 ) is represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : plotgaussian ] ( at different times  @xmath2 ) .    in order to characterize such a probability distribution",
    ", it is useful to introduce the generating function of its moments : g(,t)=e^x_-^+dxp(x , t ) e^x , whose expansion in powers of @xmath25 has the moments of @xmath0 as coefficients : g(,t)=_n=0^ x^n .",
    "[ eq : expansiong ] we note that @xmath26 . expanding the latter function in powers of @xmath25 and identifying the result to eq .",
    "( [ eq : expansiong ] ) , one gets the following expression for the moments : x^2n=(2n-1)!!(2t)^n , x^2n+1=0 .",
    "another useful tool to characterize a probability distribution is the set of its cumulants .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath27 the cumulant of order @xmath28 .",
    "the generating function for the cumulants is just the logarithm of @xmath29 , namely w(,t)=g(,t)=_n=1^+ x^n_c . in the case of brownian motion , @xmath30 , and thus all cumulants except the second order one ( the variance )",
    "are zero : x^2_c=2 t ,   x^n_c=0  .",
    "the value of the variance means that the random walk explores a region of typical size @xmath31 around the origin .",
    "( of course , this is just the width of the gaussian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : solutiondiffusion ] ) in our simple case ) .",
    "so far , we have solved the diffusion problem in the case of free boundary conditions ( the particle could diffuse on the whole lattice , without any restriction ) .",
    "let us now put an absorptive boundary at position @xmath32 . if the particle hits the position @xmath33 , it is lost , and the random walk stops .",
    "_ the solution to this problem will be used later to address the branching random walk .",
    "_      let us state mathematically the problem : we need to solve the diffusion equation @xmath35 for @xmath36 , with the initial condition @xmath37 , and the boundary condition @xmath38 .",
    "it is actually possible to replace this boundary problem by an initial - value problem , taking advantage of the linearity of the diffusion equation .",
    "it is easy to check that the initial - value problem _",
    "t p=_x^2 p , p(x,0)=(x)-(x-2x ) is equivalent to the boundary problem as long as @xmath39 .",
    "this is the so - called _ method of images_. the solution is then just the difference of eq .",

    "[ fig : plotgaussian ] .",
    "let us take the large - time limit of this expression .",
    "we assume that @xmath41 be of order 1 . we may then write      the remaining gaussian factor is significant only in the range @xmath42 .",
    "the second inequality is trivial for large @xmath2 .",
    "when the first inequality is satisfied , one may expand the @xmath43 factor , and one gets p(x , t)= e^- .",

    "we consider two different boundary conditions : free boundary conditions ( black curves , eq .",
