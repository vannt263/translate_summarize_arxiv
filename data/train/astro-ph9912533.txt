    "in order to estimate the projected cluster shape we diagonalize the inertia tensor ( @xmath0 ) where @xmath1 is the @xmath2 unit matrix . the eigenvalues @xmath3 with @xmath4 define the ellipticity of the configuration under study : @xmath5 .",
    "initially the galaxy positions are transformed to the coordinate system of each cluster .",
    "then the discrete galaxy distribution is smoothed using a gaussian kernel .",
    "all cells that have a density above some threshold are used to define the moments of inertia with weight @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the mean projected apm galaxy density .",
    "this method is free of the aperture bias and we found that it performs significantly better than using the discrete galaxy distribution .",
    "inverting a set of integral equations , which relate the projected and real axial ratio distribution , we obtain the distribution of real axial ratios under the assumption that the orientations are random with respect of line of sight .    according to @xcite , if the inverted distribution of axial ratios has significantly negative values , a fact which is unphysical , then this can be viewed as a strong indication that the particular spheroidal model is unacceptable . in figure 1",
    "we present the uncorrected and corrected intrinsic axial ratio distributions .",
    "it is evident that the apm cluster shapes are better represented by that the prolate spheroids ( in agreement with @xcite ) rather than oblate beacause the former model provides a distribution of intrinsic axial ratios that is positive over the whole axial ratio range ."
