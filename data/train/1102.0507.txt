    "ec20058@xmath05234 has been the target of a long term campaign to measure the neutrino production rate in hot dbv wds .",
    "these measurements also allow us to probe for a planetary system using the pulsation timing method , see @xcite .",
    "a planetary companion will cause a wobble of the wd around the system barycenter , resulting in variations between the expected and observed arrival times of the wd pulsations ( o@xmath0c method ) .",
    "this will cause an identical sinusoidal variation in each frequency s o@xmath0c diagram .",
    "this method has resulted in a planet detection around an sdb star , see @xcite and planetary candidates and exclusions around wds , see @xcite .",
    "we were able to build an o@xmath0c diagram for four pulsation frequencies ( figure [ oc ] ) .",
    "first we note that each has a parabolic and sinusoidal component . the parabolic contribution to",
    "an o@xmath0c is indicative of a slow linear change in period .",
    "if we fit each o@xmath0c with a parabola + sinusoid we find that the four o@xmath0c diagrams can be split into two distinct sets .",
    "two of the o@xmath0cs show a positive @xmath1 and a sinusoid with a relative phase of 0 and the other two o@xmath0cs reveal a negative @xmath1 and a sinusoid with relative phase @xmath2 .",
    "the four have a sinusoidal contribution with different amplitudes but similar period .",
    "finally we fit all four o@xmath0cs simultaneously with independent parabolas and with sinusoids of identical period and phase .",
    "the functional form of our fit to the @xmath3 o@xmath0c is @xmath4    the data and the fit is shown in figure  [ oc ] .",
    "the resultant fit parameters are summarized in table 1 .",
    "[ oc ] 5234.,title=\"fig:\",width=576 ]    [ tbl1 ]    .model fit parameters .",
    "see equation [ model ] .",
    "all units for @xmath5 and @xmath6 are @xmath7 [ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]",
    "we have discovered sinusoidal behavior in pulsating wd o@xmath0cs that are not due to a planetary companion .",
    "it has been assumed that variations of this nature could only be the result of a planet + wd system .",
    "if only one of these four modes had been observed , it is very possible that the topic of this paper would be the first planet detection around a wd . even more alarming",
    "is that the o@xmath0c diagrams have sinusoidal variations with correlated phase and period .",
    "it seems plausible that two modes behaving in this way could conspire to mimic a planet + wd system .",
    "this does not eliminate the possibility of a wd planet detection with this method , but demonstrates that a sinusoidal variation in the o@xmath0c of a single mode is inconclusive .",
    "an important question is if dav and sdbv pulsators also experience the same o@xmath0c variations .",
    "qualitatively , davs and dbvs are very similar .",
    "it would seem likely that these types of variations could exist in the davs as well .",
    "the sdbvs are somewhat different from the wd pulsators , but until the physical processes driving these variations are understood we can not exclude the possibility of this behavior .",
