    "the heavy ion collisions experiments performed at rhic and lhc create a hot and dense medium , the so - called quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , that is believed to be strongly coupled . the most compelling evidence supporting this idea comes from relativistic viscous fluid dynamics simulations that reproduce the momentum anisotropy patterns measured by experiment ( see , e.g. refs .",
    "the momentum anisotropy is the translation to momentum space of the initial spatial eccentricity of non central collisions .",
    "a weakly interacting system of particles can not convert spatial anisotropy into momentum anisotropy in an efficient way , but this translation can occur quite efficiently if the particles interact strongly .",
    "the observed large magnitude of the momentum anisotropy indicates that the qgp is strongly coupled .",
    "another indication of the strongly coupled nature of the qgp is the strong quenching of high-@xmath7 probes measured at rhic @xcite .",
    "transport coefficients such as the shear ( @xmath8 ) and bulk ( @xmath9 ) viscosities are crucial inputs in fluid dynamics simulations attempting to describe the evolution of matter created in heavy ion collisions .",
    "great efforts are currently focused on developing new theoretical tools to compute these transport coefficients more accurately from microscopic models @xcite , and also on extracting them more precisely from rhic and lhc measurements @xcite .",
    "results obtained from lattice qcd calculations @xcite indicate that @xmath0 and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the entropy density , depend significantly on temperature , showing a minimum and maximum , respectively , at the critical temperature corresponding to the qgp ",
    "hadron crossover .",
    "note that although it is expected that the transport coefficients of the qgp depend on temperature , the impact of a temperature  dependent @xmath0 on momentum anisotropies as obtained from simulations has been investigated only recently @xcite .",
    "it is possible to extract an average value of @xmath0 by matching the particle spectra and elliptic flow obtained from fluid dynamics @xcite or hybrid fluid ",
    "kinetic simulations @xcite to data .",
    "see also refs .",
    "@xcite for a description of other approaches to extract values of @xmath0 from data .",
    "the optimal value of @xmath0 that comes out of all these fits is close to the lower bound @xmath12 that was found by kovtun , son and starinets @xcite ( kss bound from now on ) via the anti de sitter / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence .",
    "however , deviations from the kss bound by a factor of two or more are still possible due to uncertainties stemming from diverse sources such as the initial conditions , the dynamics of chiral fields coupled to the quark fluid , and the freeze out stage , to mention a few  see refs .",
    "very low values of @xmath0 are also favored by studies of the overall entropy production during a collision ",
    "see e.g. @xcite  and , albeit more indirectly , by the fact that flow structures such as cones and ridges are able to survive until freeze out .",
    "if dissipative effects were too large , such collective flow structures would be washed away much earlier in the evolution of the fireball @xcite .",
    "the system created in heavy ion collisions consists of a fireball of quarks and gluons that expands and cools very rapidly under its own pressure .",
    "since the fireball is formed out of a finite number of particles and has a small size in the range @xmath13@xmath14 fm , it is natural to expect that thermal fluctuations may have an observable impact on its evolution . in spite of this expectation , the role of thermal fluctuations and",
    "its impact on hydrodynamic evolution has only very recently been discussed in the context of heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that for the qgp with small values of @xmath0 near the kss bound , thermal fluctuations on top of long  lived sound and shear waves can contribute significantly to the effective value of @xmath0 as would be measured on large scales .",
    "in contrast , for larger values @xmath5 the correction coming from thermal fluctuations on sound and shear waves was found to be negligible .",
    "specifically , in @xcite the authors used kubo s formula together with second order hydrodynamics and focused on corrections to @xmath0 coming from the zeroth order ( in gradients ) , quadratic term @xmath15 in the energy momentum tensor @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the equilibrium energy density and pressure ( @xmath19 for a conformal fluid ) , respectively , and @xmath20 is the flow velocity fluctuation ( @xcite considers a vanishing background velocity ) . a related study on the effective shear viscosity of the strongly coupled qgp",
    "was carried out in @xcite using the ads / cft correspondence , where corrections to @xmath8 arising from higher order velocity gradients were computed using the idea of resumming those corrections into an effective @xmath21 depending on both frequency and momentum .    in this work",
    "we compute the correction to the shear viscosity that come from the effect of relatively small scale fluctuations of the hydrodynamic modes on their evolution on larger scales . for this purpose ,",
    "we use the equations of relativistic fluctuating fluid dynamics @xcite and focus on terms which are second order in velocity gradients ( in @xmath16 these terms are first order ) and quadratic in velocity fluctuations .",
    "the development presented here is based on a division of hydrodynamic modes in ultrasoft and soft sectors , both of them subjected to the influence of stochastic noise coming from hard ( i.e. particle  like ) modes .",
    "it is , therefore , inspired in the hard thermal loops approach to thermal field theory @xcite and particularly in earlier studies of the langevin dynamics of soft and ultrasoft modes @xcite .",
    "as this approach does not rely on kubo s formula it is different from the one adopted in @xcite .",
    "we anticipate that the correction computed here is of order @xmath22 or higher , where @xmath23 is the value of momentum beyond which the second order gradient expansion breaks down , while the correction obtained in @xcite is of order @xmath24 .",
    "since @xmath24 must be small for a fluid description to be reliable , the correction to @xmath0 obtained here is suppressed with respect to the one of @xcite , but as we will show it is still significant .",
    "we will compare our results with those of @xcite in sections [ shear ] and [ num ] .",
    "it is appropriate at this point to emphasize that our approach is purely phenomenological .",
    "it is not our intention to give a precise value of the correction to the microscopic shear viscosity arising from second order terms , but rather to provide a reasonable upper bound for it under realistic conditions for the qgp .",
    "we note that the correction that we obtain , as well as that obtained in @xcite , is inversely proportional to @xmath0 , and therefore diverges for vanishing @xmath0 . as pointed out recently by torrieri @xcite in the context of ideal quantum hydrodynamics , the cure for this divergence may lie in quantum corrections that set in for small @xmath0 and therefore `` correct the correction '' .",
    "although this is an important issue with strong implications for the study of matter created in heavy ion collisions and surely deserves further attention , here we shall not dwelve further into it since we focus on the correction to @xmath0 arising at finite values of this ratio .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ fluc ]",
    "we describe the theoretical setup and obtain the equations for the ultrasoft and soft modes . in section [ shear ]",
    "we compute the correction to the shear viscosity arising from second order soft terms , and then provide numerical estimates for a weakly and a strongly coupled theory , in particular focusing on the qgp created in heavy ion collisions .",
    "finally , we conclude with a brief summary and outlook in section [ summary ] .",
    "details on the calculation of the correction to @xmath0 are given in appendix [ app ] , while a description of the procedure used to compute the frequency that separates ultrasoft and soft modes is given in appendix [ omin ] .",
    "we consider a conformal fluid in flat spacetime with signature @xmath25 . the comoving time and",
    "space derivatives are @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations at second order in velocity gradients read @xmath28 where we have made the approximation @xmath29 which is enough for our purposes here . the brackets",
    "@xmath30 around indices denote the symmetric and traceless projection orthogonal to @xmath20 , while round brackets denote symmetrization .",
    "@xmath8 is the microscopic shear viscosity as derived e.g. by kubo s formula , and @xmath31 are stochastic noises . for recent reviews on relativistic viscous fluid dynamics as applied to heavy ion collisions",
    "@xcite .",
    "next we divide the hydrodynamic fields into `` ultrasoft '' and `` soft '' parts , @xmath32 on top of this separation into ultrasoft and soft sectors , we perfom an expansion in deviations from equilibrium characterized by a small parameter , @xmath33 , staying at linear order , thus @xmath34 in this way @xmath35 correspond to thermal equilibrium . for notational simplicity",
    "is it convenient to define @xmath36 it will be shown in the next section that @xmath37 , with @xmath38 close to but not exactly unity , and that @xmath39 , which imply that @xmath40 and @xmath41 in the local rest frame ( lrf ) .",
    "we note that @xmath42 .",
    "additional constrains arising from the normalization of @xmath20 are discussed in the next section .",
    "note that our treatment is purely hydrodynamic , i.e. assuming momenta to be small , so no attempt is made to actually derive the noise as coming from the _ hard _ sector of a microscopic field which should be described by transport equations such as boltzmann equation @xcite .",
    "so , the ultrasoft and soft modes of the hydrodynamic fields are described by the conservation equations of fluid dynamics , while the effect of the hard modes on the hydrodynamic evolution is included through the noises @xmath31 .",
    "this is not a limitation to our purpose here , since we intend to determine the correction to @xmath8 coming from long  lived _ hydrodynamic _ modes ( shear and sound waves ) .",
    "a reasonable estimate for the value of the momentum separating soft and hard modes will be given in section [ shear ] .",
    "this estimate is essentially based on the requirement that second order terms in derivatives must be smaller than first order terms , i.e. that the gradient expansion does not break down .",
    "the value of momentum that separates ultrasoft from soft modes can be computed by requiring that the equations of the soft modes be linearizable ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is done in appendix [ omin ] . due to the phenomenological nature of our approach , and taking into account",
    "that we intend to provide an upper bound to the correction to @xmath0 , we also compute this correction for different values of the soft  ultrasoft separation frequency .",
    "we will come back to this point in section [ shear ] . for the moment , let us leave this separation implicit .    in",
    "what follows we will use latin indices @xmath43 to denote spatial coordinates , i.e. @xmath44 with @xmath45 . at zeroth order in @xmath33",
    "the conservation equations for the ultrasoft modes read @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a thermal average .",
    "the zeroth order linearized equations for the soft modes are @xmath48 note that the noises are determined by the equilibrium state , as dictated by the fluctuation  dissipation theorem .",
    "their role is to enforce thermal equilibrium at zeroth order in @xmath33 , constraining the expression for the thermal correlator of velocity fluctuations which will be given in section [ shear ] .    at first order",
    "we get for the ultrasoft modes @xmath49 and @xmath50 with @xmath51    for the soft modes we get @xmath52 and @xmath53 with @xmath54    in deriving eqs .",
    "( [ 1s])([2h2e ] ) we have used that @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 , @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , and put @xmath63 which by definition are traceless and orthogonal to @xmath64 . note that we have neglected terms @xmath65 or higher in the thermal averages .",
    "moreover , we have set @xmath66 , which is a reasonable approximation since , as it will be seen later , the term we are interested in is already linear in @xmath33 . note that , since we stay at first order and @xmath65 , those terms containing @xmath67 that would appear in eqs .",
    "( [ 1s])([2h2e ] ) actually vanish because in these terms we can put @xmath68 ( see eq .",
    "( [ nabla ] ) ) .      we will now discuss the normalization of the fluid velocity . for consistency ,",
    "the velocity should be normalized both in the mean and at linear order in fluctuations , i.e. @xmath69 , because it is @xmath20 who satisfies the conservation equations ( [ hydroeq ] ) .",
    "we also require that @xmath70 which implies @xmath71 so at first order we get @xmath72    the transversality and tracelessness of @xmath73 must be satisfied both in the mean and at linear order in fluctuations .",

    "it is seen that the value of @xmath109 does not depend strongly on @xmath203 ; the variation of @xmath126 with @xmath203 is small for @xmath6 and negligible for @xmath173 .",
    "these results show that the correction to @xmath0 for the strongly coupled theory remains bounded , giving strong support to the conclusion that @xmath207 for the qgp under realistic conditions in the temperature range @xmath201@xmath4 mev .",
    "our results clearly illustrate the fact , already highlighted in @xcite , that for a strongly coupled fluid such as the qgp formed in heavy ion collisions , thermal fluctuations actually _ do _ change the value of the effective infrared @xmath0 , provided that the microscopic value of the ratio is small .",
    "specifically , we have found that in strongly coupled theories with an @xmath0 close to the kss value the correction due to second order terms in the fluid dynamic equations is _ at most _",
    "@xmath200 of the `` bare '' value , while for larger values of @xmath0 it is extremely small and can be safely neglected . for a weakly coupled theory",
    "the correction turns out to be much smaller than at strong coupling , and can be neglected even at @xmath6 .",
    "these are the main results of this work .    to put our findings into perspective",
    ", it is appropriate at this point to note that the correction @xmath126 found in ref .",
    "@xcite from the zeroth order term @xmath15 in @xmath16 is , for the same values of @xmath208 , etc .",
    "as used here , roughly @xmath209 for @xmath184 ( for @xmath173 it is negligible ) .",
    "the correction computed here , that comes from the second order ultrasoft term in the fluid dynamic equations , is at most five times smaller for @xmath6 .",
    "our results provide further support to the conclusion that , for the strongly coupled qgp created in heavy ion collisions , a value of @xmath6 at @xmath201@xmath4 mev seems to be ruled out by the effect of thermal fluctuations on the hydrodynamic evolution of the longest wavelength modes , but a value of @xmath174 is still quite plausible .",
    "in this work we compute the correction to the microscopic shear viscosity ( i.e. the one computed from kubo formula ) induced from thermal fluctuations appearing in second order gradient terms in the equations of relativistic fluid dynamics .",
    "our calculations are based on the idea of separating the hydrodynamic variables in ultrasoft and soft sectors , and determining the effect of the latter on the evolution of the former .",
    "the hard modes , which are not described by fluid dynamics , enter the conservation equations through stochastic noises . in this sense , the developments presented here fall naturally into the relativistic fluctuating hydrodynamics framework .",
    "we find that the correction to @xmath0 is positive and inversely proportional to the square of this ratio .",
    "for the conditions prevailing in heavy ion collisions , we estimate the maximum correction to the viscosity  to  entropy ratio of the qgp at @xmath210@xmath4 mev to be @xmath200 for @xmath184 and @xmath211 for @xmath174 .",
    "these results indicate that for small @xmath0 ( close to the kss bound ) the influence of soft modes on the evolution of the ultrasoft modes is significant . for larger values of @xmath0 , the corrections are indeed very small and can be safely neglected .",
    "the correction for a weakly coupled theory is much smaller than the one found at strong coupling and can be neglected even for value of @xmath0 close to the kss bound .",
    "our results support the conclusion found in @xcite that thermal fluctuations have a significant impact on the value of the effective infrared @xmath0 corresponding to the quark  gluon plasma created in heavy ion collisions , provided that the microscopic value of @xmath0 is small",
    ". our work , and those of @xcite , evidence the important fact that what could actually be extracted from data ( for example by matching computed hadron observables to measurements ) is an effective value of the ratio @xmath0 rather than the value computed microscopically . in this sense ,",
    "our work gives further support to the conclusion that a value of @xmath184 for the strongly coupled qgp that is created in heavy ion collisions seems impossible due to the effect of thermal fluctuations on the hydrodynamic evolution in the range @xmath210@xmath4 mev , whereas a value of @xmath173 is not ruled out .",
    "probably one of the most interesting things to try out is to simulate the three  dimensional evolution of the fireball created in heavy ion collisions using the equations of fluctuating hydrodynamics in order to be able to extract a value of @xmath0 which in principle should be closer to the real one ( first steps in this direction have been taken in @xcite with a boost  invariant bjorken model ) .",
    "moreover , a comparison with the values extracted from viscous hydrodynamic simulations without thermal fluctuations would allow us to directly quantify the correction to @xmath0 arising from the effects of such fluctuations on the hydrodynamic evolution of matter created in heavy ion collisions .",
    "in this appendix we describe in detail the calculation of the correction @xmath109 to the shear viscosity .",

    ", we will assume that @xmath218 is a very slowly varying function , which allows us to approximate @xmath219 with @xmath220^{-1}(x - y )   d_0(x ) s_{12}(x - y )   \\label{etacx}\\ ] ] the approximation that @xmath125 be a slowly - varying function is appropriate for our aim of providing an estimative upper bound on @xmath109 , and in any case it can be regarded as a definition of @xmath109 that is valid for all practical purposes .",
    "going over to momentum space , we can write @xmath221 or , putting @xmath222 , @xmath223 it is important to remark that the frequency integrations in eqs .",
    "( [ etaaux ] ) and ( [ etack ] ) run over all ( positive and negative ) values of the frequency .",

    "( [ etack ] ) to @xmath226 . an immediate consequence of this is that the terms @xmath227 drop out when integrated , and hence need not be considered further in what follows .",
    "assuming that the noises satisfy the fluctuation ",

    "this means that the integral must be done over modes satisfying @xmath233 , where @xmath127 is the value of the four momentum separating soft and hard modes as discussed in section [ fluc ] .",
