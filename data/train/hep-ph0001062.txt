    "inclusive charmonium production processes can be expressed in a factorized form , combining a short - distance expansion with the use of a non - relativistic qcd lagrangian ( nrqcd ) @xcite .",
    "the short - distance expansion works best for total production cross sections , provided the expansion parameter @xmath3 ( of order of the typical velocity squared of the quarks in the bound state ) is small enough .",
    "it follows that contrary to prior belief many charmonium production processes such as production in hadron - hadron collisions at large transverse momentum @xcite and at fixed target @xcite , and in @xmath2 meson decay @xcite , are actually dominated by production of a coloured @xmath1 state , followed by a long - distance transition to charmonium and light hadrons @xcite .    the theoretical prediction of charmonium energy distributions is more delicate . a long - standing problem for the nrqcd factorization approach concerns the @xmath4-distribution in inelastic @xmath0 photoproduction , where @xmath5 is the quarkonium energy fraction in the proton rest frame .",
    "the colour octet contributions to this quantity grow rapidly near @xmath6 @xcite , in conflict with observation @xcite , unless the nrqcd matrix elements that normalize the colour octet contribution are made rather small . produced in hadron - hadron collisions at large transverse momentum @xcite has been regarded as the crucial test of the theoretical framework .",
    "if recent indications from cdf of no polarization @xcite are confirmed by higher statistics data , this may indicate a problem with factorization , as suggested in @xcite , or it may imply large spin - symmetry violating corrections . ]",
    "one of the physical origins of this discrepancy is as follows : the fragmentation of the coloured @xmath1 state into @xmath0 occurs via the emission of gluons with small momentum fractions of order @xmath3 .",
    "because the momentum of these gluons is small compared to the momenta involved in the hard subprocess that creates the @xmath1 state , it is neglected in leading order in the short - distance expansion ( in @xmath3 ) ; the fragmentation into @xmath0 is described by a single number ( the ` nrqcd matrix element ' ) .",
    "this is adequate for total production cross sections , but it is not for distributions in the kinematic region , where the charmonium carries nearly maximal energy . in this region , the @xmath0 energy distribution is evidently sensitive to the energy distribution of the soft emitted gluons .",
    "in particular , we expect that the @xmath0 energy distribution should fall to zero , rather than grow , near the point of maximal energy , if the @xmath0 is produced via a colour octet state , since the emission of gluons with momentum much smaller than their typical one is rather unlikely .",
    "the inadequacy of a leading - order treatment of the short - distance expansion , and the necessity to account for the kinematics of soft gluon emission , is even more evident for @xmath0 production in @xmath2 meson decay .",
    "the leading order partonic short - distance process @xmath7 results in @xmath1 pairs with fixed ( maximal ) energy , in stark contrast to the broad energy distribution observed @xcite .",
    "the broad energy distribution of multi - body final states has to be attributed to soft gluon emission and to the fermi motion of the @xmath8 quark in the @xmath2 meson .    technically speaking",
    ", the velocity expansion of the short - distance process breaks down near the kinematic endpoint of maximal charmonium energy @xcite , because higher - order terms in the small parameter @xmath3 are compensated by inverse powers of small kinematic invariants .",
    "such a breakdown of the short - distance expansion is not specific to quarkonium production in the nrqcd approach , but occurs quite generally for inclusive processes , for example in deep - inelastic scattering as bjorken @xmath9 or in semi - leptonic or radiative @xmath2 decays @xcite .",
    "when the quarkonium carries a fraction @xmath10 of its maximal energy , where @xmath11 is small , the inclusiveness of the process is restricted by the small phase - space left for the emission of further particles .",
    "the process is then also sensitive to the fact that the physical phase space is limited by hadron kinematics , while the calculation of short - distance coefficients is carried out in terms of partons .",
    "the short - distance expansion reacts to this non - inclusiveness by exhibiting terms of order @xmath12 . in some cases",
    "one can sum the leading terms in @xmath13 to all orders and express the quarkonium production cross section as a convolution of a non - perturbative ` shape function ' with a partonic cross section .",
    "the shape function leads to a smearing of the energy spectrum .",
    "the shape function formalism is analogous to a leading twist approximation , and is appropriate for @xmath14 . in this intermediate region",
    "the framework of the nrqcd factorization approach is still valid , reorganized by a partial resummation of the velocity expansion .",
    "however , in the extreme endpoint region , @xmath15 , the twist expansion also breaks down .",
    "the leading twist expressions for several energy distributions have been derived in @xcite .",
    "but since the shape function is non - perturbative and essentially unknown , no quantitative analysis has been performed .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to explore the kinematic effect of soft gluons in the fragmentation of a coloured @xmath1 pair quantitatively .",
    "in particular , we will be interested in the question whether folding the short - distance cross section with a shape function can indeed account for the observed @xmath4-distribution in @xmath0 photoproduction .",
    "the emission of soft gluons with energy of order @xmath16 in the quarkonium rest frame can not be computed perturbatively and we have to model it .",
    "our ansatz for the soft gluon radiation function will be guided by simplicity .",
    "the important feature of the model is that it incorporates the kinematics of soft gluon radiation together with reasonable assumptions on the typical energy scales involved .",
    "the ansatz bears some similarities with fermi motion smearing @xcite and , in particular , the accmm model @xcite for semileptonic @xmath2 decays .",
    "since the precise form of the energy distribution near the endpoint depends on the ansatz for the shape function , our results do not constitute theoretical predictions .",
    "however , as we shall see , a satisfactory description of @xmath2 decay data can indeed be obtained with a reasonable ansatz for the shape function .",
    "a further cross check is provided by applying the same shape function to the @xmath0 energy distribution in photoproduction .",
    "this however , turns out to be more problematic .",
    "the paper is divided as follows : sect .",
    "2 is ` theoretical ' .",
    "we define the model and derive the equation that describes the convolution of the short - distance process with the shape function for a general production process .",
    "we also show that the model is equivalent to a specific form of the nrqcd shape function in the region where a leading twist approximation is valid .",
    "to illustrate the formalism , we consider the limit @xmath17 , in which charmonium is a coulomb bound state .",
    "we rederive nrqcd factorization for this specific case and compute the shape function in this limit .",
    "the ansatz for the non - perturbative shape function depends on a few model parameters . in sect .",
    "3 we apply the model to the @xmath0 momentum distribution in @xmath18 and tune the parameters of the model to the observed momentum distribution . in sect .",
    "4 the more complicated ( and more interesting ) case of inelastic photoproduction is considered .",
    "in this section we derive the general expression for the smeared quarkonium energy distributions on which the applications to @xmath2 decay and photoproduction will be based . to motivate our approach and to make more explicit contact with the formalism of @xcite",
    ", we begin by considering the production amplitude for quarkonium in the coulomb limit , and with emission of a single soft gluon , before generalizing the expressions to the case of interest . in the last subsection we return to the coulomb limit and",
    "compute the shape function in this limit .",
    "this provides us with an idea of the form of the shape function in a controlled , although unrealistic limit .",
    "inclusive charmonium production proceeds in two stages @xcite : first a pair of nearly on - shell and co - moving charm quarks is created in a hard process in which typical momenta are of order @xmath19 ( or larger , if there is another hard scale ) in the charmonium rest frame .",
    "the nearly on - shell @xmath1 state then fragments into charmonium via emission of soft particles with energy and momentum of order @xmath16 in the charmonium rest frame . that characterizes the non - relativistic charmonium bound state and the typical virtuality @xmath20 of the nearly on - shell @xmath21 and @xmath22 quark .",

    "the nearly on - shell heavy quark propagators that connect the hard and soft part in the figure should be considered as part of @xmath28 .",
    "see below . ]    to define the hard and soft parts in ( [ start ] ) accurately , we use the amplitude for the process @xmath29 , relevant to inelastic photoproduction , as an example .",
    "it is also instructive to take the limit @xmath17 , where @xmath30 is now of order @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the strong interaction scale .",
    "we call this the coulomb limit , because the charmonium bound state is perturbatively calculable in this limit and the dominant binding is through the coulomb force .",
    "the coulomb limit is much stronger than the non - relativistic limit . while charmonium and bottomonium are non - relativistic ( @xmath33 ) , they are not coulombic ( @xmath34 ) in reality . in particular , the nrqcd matrix elements , which are usually taken as non - perturbative parameters , can be perturbatively calculated in the coulomb limit , up to corrections suppressed by powers of @xmath35 .    a particular contribution to the @xmath29 amplitude",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "the corresponding squared amplitude is the sum of terms where both gluons are hard or both gluons are soft or one of them is hard and the other is soft .",
    "the hard - soft term is the most interesting one for inelastic photoproduction through the colour octet mechanism and we focus on it first .",
    "the other two terms will be briefly discussed later .",
    "suppose the gluon with momentum @xmath36 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is hard and the gluon with momentum @xmath37 is soft . on - shell",
    "soft gluons in nrqcd can have energy of order @xmath38 and @xmath16 @xcite ( called ` soft ' and ` ultrasoft ' , respectively , in @xcite ) .",
    "however , gluons with energy of order @xmath38 can not be radiated over the time - scale @xmath39 and do not appear as final state particles in the scattering amplitude . sends the heavy quark propagator off - shell , a subgraph with energy and momentum of order @xmath38 in the amplitude squared has no @xmath40 cut , as would be required for a non - zero contribution to the @xmath29 amplitude .",
    "rather such a subgraph can be expanded into a series of instantaneous interactions , which contribute to the potential between the heavy quarks . ]",
    "consequently , the scale of @xmath37 is @xmath16 .",
    "this is important , because this will set the scale for the energy of soft gluon emission in our model parametrization later .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we included ( dashed lines ) the instantaneous exchange of ( coulomb ) gluons with energy of order @xmath16 and momentum of order @xmath38 .",
    "if this exchange occurs between nearly on - shell heavy quark propagators with off - shellness of order @xmath16 , it is not suppressed by the small coupling constant , because the total contribution from each gluon is of order @xmath41 .",
    "if one of the heavy quark propagators is far off - shell , coulomb exchange represents an ordinary higher - order correction to the amplitude . hence we can neglect gluon exchange to the left of the gluon with momentum @xmath36 .",
    "the gluon ladder ` between ' the emission of the gluons with momentum @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively , can not be neglected , but it is summed into the coulomb green function @xmath42 , the green function for the schrdinger equation with the ( leading order ) coulomb potential . the green function is related to the quark - antiquark scattering amplitude for a quark - antiquark pair with ( small ) relative three momentum @xmath43 into a quark - antiquark pair with ( small ) relative three momentum @xmath44 with total non - relativistic energy @xmath45 .",
    "likewise the gluon ladder to the right of the gluon with momentum @xmath37 is summed and contained in the bound state wave function . for a @xmath46 state , such as @xmath0 , the bound state wave function in the bound state rest frame",

    "the amplitude is not yet in a factorized form , because the hard sub - amplitude still depends on @xmath68 and @xmath69 and its spin and colour indices are entangled with those of the remaining part of the amplitude .",
    "as described in @xcite , we can perform a spin and colour decomposition that disentangles the two parts of the amplitude .",
    "we then expand the hard sub - amplitude in the small momentum @xmath68 , which amounts to an expansion in derivative operators and a decomposition in orbital angular momentum .",
    "as a matter of principle , we could also expand the hard sub - amplitude in @xmath69 .",

    "likewise , the transverse momentum of the @xmath1 pair with respect to the beam axis @xmath475 differs from @xmath449 .",
    "this happens for two reasons : first , the loss of energy to radiation also implies a loss of transverse momentum with respect to the beam axis , if the @xmath0 is not parallel to the beam axis .",
    "second , the @xmath0 can gain transverse momentum by recoil against the soft gluons radiated during the fragmentation process . for fixed @xmath406 ,",
    "this is preferred to losing transverse momentum , because the production amplitude for the @xmath1 pair increases with smaller @xmath408 .",
    "the dominant effect is the one related to @xmath476 .",
    "the corresponding increase of the spectrum ( for @xmath278 non - zero and moderate @xmath4 ) relative to the partonic spectrum is stronger as @xmath477 is chosen smaller , since the hard cross section rises faster for smaller @xmath477 ( and would approach the collinear and soft divergence at @xmath6 , if @xmath478 ) .",
    "finally , at very large @xmath4 , the suppression due to the radiation function @xmath294 wins and turns the spectrum over to zero .    to illustrate these remarks we define an ad hoc modification of the hard cross sections @xmath479 : @xmath480 the energy spectra analogous to the upper panel of fig .",

    "the qualitative features evident in the upper panel follow from the previous discussion . at large @xmath4",
    "the spectrum turns over , but at intermediate @xmath4 , including the entire region where data exist , there is a large enhancement , which follows from the fact that the partonic matrix element is sampled very close to @xmath491 .",
    "taken at face value , the disagreement with data is worse after accounting for @xmath1 fragmentation effects .",
    "however , the theoretical prediction with small transverse momentum cut is unreliable at large @xmath4 . with no @xmath406 cut at all",
    ", we expect that the @xmath4 spectrum is drastically modified at large @xmath4 after accounting for the @xmath450 process , the virtual corrections to it , and soft gluon radiation from the initial gluon .",
    "owing to the sensitivity to large @xmath407 , the theoretical prediction is more sensitive to these modifications when gluon radiation in @xmath1 fragmentation is included .",
    "an indication of this is provided by plotting the spectrum with the modified partonic cross section .",
    "this modification of the partonic cross section , although ad hoc , may give a qualitative representation of the effects to be expected from soft gluon resummation .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] shows that the unphysical enhancement is largely reduced in this case , although it does not disappear completely .",
    "if reality turned out to resemble the lower panel , it would be difficult to disentangle colour octet contributions , given the additional normalization uncertainties of both , the colour singlet and the colour octet contributions . in this case",
    "a @xmath0 polarization measurement would provide useful additional information @xcite .",
    "the results of this analysis can be summarized as follows : with the small transverse momentum cut on the @xmath0 currently used by both hera collaborations , the region @xmath492 is beyond theoretical control .",
    "this remains true even after resummation of large higher order nrqcd corrections via the shape function , since the hard partonic cross section is sensitive to other modifications that are also difficult to control theoretically at such small transverse momentum .",
    "at present , the experimental data can not be interpreted as providing evidence for or against the presence of colour octet contributions in photoproduction .",
    "it is not necessary to reduce the colour octet matrix elements as suggested in @xcite to arrive at this conclusion .",
    "this is welcome as matrix elements of the order quoted in sect .",
    "[ bsect ] seem to be needed to account for the observed branching fraction of @xmath275 .",
    "the situation in photoproduction remains unsatisfactory . in our opinion , nothing is learnt on quarkonium production mechanisms , if a small transverse momentum cut is used .",
    "we therefore recommend that future increases in integrated luminosity should not be used to reduce the experimental errors on the present analysis , but to increase the transverse momentum cut at the expense of statistics .",
    "in this paper we provided a first investigation of the kinematic effect of soft emission in the fragmentation process @xmath98\\to j/\\psi +   x$ ] . in the nrqcd factorization approach to inclusive quarkonium production",
    "these effects appear as kinematically enhanced higher order corrections in the nrqcd expansion @xcite , which become important near the upper endpoint of quarkonium energy / momentum spectra .",
    "the shape function formalism discussed in @xcite resums these corrections and allows us to extend to validity of the nrqcd approach closer to the endpoint , although the entire spectrum is not covered even after this resummation . in the present paper , we implemented the kinematics of soft gluon radiation exactly and used an ansatz for the probability of radiation of soft gluons .",
    "this allows us to cover the entire energy spectrum , although in a model - dependent way .",
    "the model is consistent with the nrqcd shape function formalism in the energy region where the later applies .",
    "this situation is similar to the relation of the accmm model to the heavy quark expansion in inclusive semi - leptonic decays of @xmath2 mesons .",
    "the main result is provided by ( [ master ] ) , which applies to a general inclusive quarkonium production process , when the partonic final state before fragmentation consists of a @xmath1 pair and one additional massless , energetic parton .",
    "we then proceeded to two applications of the formalism .",
    "these applications are not necessarily the simplest ones conceivable , but they seem to be most interesting .",
    "we first considered @xmath0 production in @xmath2 decay , which proceeds through colour octet states by a large fraction . in this case",
    "the effect of emission in fragmentation of colour octet @xmath1 pairs has to be disentangled from fermi motion of the @xmath8 quark in the @xmath2 meson .",
    "we found that the description of the spectrum improves significantly , when soft radiation is included , and if the parameter @xmath278 that controls the energy scale for soft radiation is chosen around @xmath255mev .",
    "the shape function defined in @xcite is production process independent . assuming universality of our ansatz over the entire energy range , the same ansatz is used for inelastic @xmath0 photoproduction .",
    "we found that the energy spectrum turns over at @xmath493 , to be compared with the partonic spectrum that rises towards @xmath6 .",
    "however , at @xmath494 , the colour octet contributions to the spectrum still grow faster than the colour singlet contribution . due to the increase of the partonic cross section ,",
    "the increase is in fact faster in this intermediate @xmath4 region after @xmath1 fragmentation effects are included .",
    "we also concluded that the transverse momentum cut @xmath489gev , presently used by the hera experiments , is too small to arrive at a reliable theoretical prediction .",
    "hence , no conclusion regarding colour octet contributions and the validity of the nrqcd formalism can presently be drawn from hera data .    the formalism developed in this paper",
    "could be applied to other production processes , in which the @xmath0 energy is measured .",
    "another interesting extension is quarkonium decays , when the energy of one of the decay particles is measured , such as the photon energy in @xmath495 and @xmath496 .",
    "since decay processes are less affected by theoretical uncertainties related to colour recombination and initial state radiation than production processes , this may lead to theoretically better controlled applications of the shape function formalism .",
