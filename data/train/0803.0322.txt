    "the foundations of our present understanding of _ advection - dominated accretion _ were laid out in a series of papers by narayan & yi ( 1994 , 1995a , b , hereafter ny94 , ny95a , ny95b ) , abramowicz et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and chen et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , although some ideas were anticipated much earlier by ichimaru ( 1977 ) .",
    "the specific abbreviation adaf , which stands for _ advection - dominated accretion flow _ , was introduced by lasota(1996 ) and has become standard in the field .",
    "we review here the application of adafs to accreting black holes ( bhs ) , and in  4 we also consider their application to accreting neutron stars .",
    "the energy equation per unit volume of an accretion flow can be written compactly in the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the density , @xmath6 is the temperature , @xmath7 is the entropy per unit mass , @xmath8 is time , @xmath9 is the flow velocity , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the heating and cooling rates per unit volume .",
    "this equation states that the rate at which the entropy per unit volume of the gas increases is equal to the heating rate minus the cooling rate .",
    "since any entropy stored in the gas is advected with the flow , the left - hand side of equation ( 1 ) may be viewed as the effective _ advective cooling",
    "_ rate @xmath12 .",
    "equation ( 1 ) can then be rearranged to give @xmath13 which states that the heat energy released by viscous dissipation is partially lost by radiative cooling and partially by advective cooling .",
    "the standard thin accretion disk model ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; novikov & thorne 1973 ; frank , king & raine 2002 ) corresponds to the case when the accreting gas is _ radiatively efficient _ , so that we have @xmath14 since the gas cools efficiently , the sound speed is much less than the local keplerian speed @xmath15 and the disk is geometrically thin .",
    "also , the disk radiates about a tenth of the rest mass energy of the accreting gas , the precise fraction depending on the bh spin ( see shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) .",
    "an adaf corresponds to the opposite regime . here",
    "the gas is _",
    "radiatively inefficient _ and the accretion flow is underluminous .",
    "thus , an adaf is defined by the condition @xmath16 some papers in the literature define an adaf as a flow that corresponds exactly to a self - similar solution described in ny94 ( see  3.1 ) .",
    "this is a needless restriction . in our opinion , it is more fruitful to employ the general definition of an adaf as given in equation ( [ adafdef ] ) , and the flow is only marginally radiatively inefficient ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . nevertheless , even here , the two solutions are very distinct from each other . ] .",
    "there are two distinct regimes of advection - dominated accretion .",
    "the first , the one that we focus on in this article is when the accreting gas is very tenuous and has a long cooling time ( ny94 ; ny95b ; abramowicz et al .",
    "this regime is sometimes referred to as a riaf  a `` radiatively inefficient accretion flow ''  and is defined by the condition @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the cooling time of the gas and @xmath19 is the accretion time .",
    "the second regime of advection - dominated accretion is when the particles in the gas have no trouble cooling , but the scattering optical depth of the accretion flow is so large that the radiation is unable to diffuse out of the system .",
    "this radiation - trapped regime was briefly discussed by begelman ( 1979 ) and was developed in detail by abramowicz et al .",
    "( 1988 ) in their `` slim disk '' model .",
    "the defining condition for this regime of adafs is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the diffusion time for photons .",
    "the present review is devoted exclusively to the adaf / riaf form of accretion ( see narayan , mahadevan & quataert 1998b ; kato , fukue & mineshige 1998 ; lasota 1999a , b ; quataert 2001 ; narayan 2002 , 2005 ; igumenshchev 2004 ; done , gierlinsky & kubota 2007 for reviews emphasizing various aspects of adafs ) .",
    "we will henceforth drop the modifier riaf and refer to these flows simply as adafs .    as explained above ,",
    "an adaf is by definition very different from the standard thin accretion disk .",
    "correspondingly , it is characterized by very distinct observational signatures .",
    "both adafs and thin disks have well - known counterparts in nature .",
    "in an adaf , since most of the energy released by viscous dissipation is retained in the gas , the pressure is large , and so is the sound speed : @xmath22 , where the keplerian velocity @xmath23 is equal to @xmath24 with @xmath25 being the radius in schwarzschild units , @xmath26 .",
    "the large pressure has several immediate consequences .",
    "first , the accretion flow becomes geometrically thick , with a vertical height @xmath27 of order the radius @xmath28 ( an adaf may be viewed as the viscous rotating analog of spherical bondi accretion ) .",
    "second , the flow has considerable pressure - support in the radial direction , so the angular velocity becomes sub - keplerian .",
    "third , the radial velocity of the gas is relatively large : @xmath29 , where @xmath30 ( see below ) is the standard dimensionless viscosity parameter ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "fourth , the large radial velocity leads to a short accretion time : @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the free - fall time .",
    "finally , the large velocity and large scale height cause the gas density to be very low , and so the cooling time is very long and the medium is optically thin .",
    "the above properties are nicely illustrated in the self - similar adaf solution derived by ny94 , in which all quantities in the accretion flow behave as power - laws in radius .",
    "( a similar solution was obtained by spruit et al .",
    "1987 in a different context . )",
    "ny94 obtained a general solution for arbitrary viscosity parameter @xmath33 , adiabatic index @xmath34 , and advection parameter corresponds to a fully cooling - dominated ( no advection ) flow and @xmath35 corresponds to a fully advection - dominated ( no radiative cooling ) flow . ]",
    "@xmath36 . in the limit @xmath37 ( a good approximation ) and @xmath38 ( radiatively very inefficient flow )",
    ", the solution simplifies to @xmath39v_k =   -0.53 \\alpha v_k , \\\\",
    "\\omega & = & \\left[{2(5/3-\\gamma)\\over3(\\gamma-5/9)}\\right]^{1/2}\\omega_k =   0.34 \\omega_k , \\\\",
    "c_s & = & \\left[{2(\\gamma-1)\\over3(\\gamma-5/9)}\\right]^{1/2}v_k =   0.59 v_k.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the numerical coefficients on the right correspond to @xmath40 , a reasonable choice ( see quataert & narayan 1999 ) .",
    "the great virtue of the above self - similar solution is that it is analytic and provides an easy and transparent way of understanding all the key properties of an adaf .",
    "its biggest deficiency is that it is scale - free , which means that it is inappropriate near the inner or outer boundary of the flow .",
    "therefore , for detailed work , one must use global solutions of the adaf equations that satisfy appropriate boundary conditions ( e.g. , abramowicz et al .",
    "1996 ; narayan , kato & honma 1997c ; chen , abramowicz & lasota 1997 ; manmoto , mineshige & kusunose 1997 ; popham & gammie 1998 ; manmoto 2000 ) . calculating global solutions",
    "is somewhat involved and one may wish to employ some short - cuts ( e.g. , yuan , ma & narayan 2008 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "even the exact global solutions are somewhat limited since they solve a set of height - integrated equations . for greater realism",
    ", one might wish to work directly with numerical simulations ( e.g. , goldston , quataert & igumenshchev 2005 ; noble et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the adaf solution is gas pressure dominated . since @xmath41 , this means the gas temperature is nearly virial . under normal conditions , gas at such a high temperature",
    "will radiate copiously , especially at small radii where the temperature can approach @xmath0 k. thus , in order to have an adaf , the accreting gas generally has to be a _ two - temperature plasma _",
    "( at least at small radii ) , with electron temperature @xmath42 much less than the ion temperature @xmath43 ( ny95b ) .",
    "( the only way to avoid this condition is by having an extremely low accretion rate below about @xmath44 of the eddington rate . )",
    "typical adaf models have the two temperatures scaling as @xmath45    in order for gas in an adaf to be two - temperature , there must be weak coupling between electrons and ions . models generally assume that the coupling occurs via coulomb collisions , which is inefficient at the densities under consideration .",
    "begelman & chiueh ( 1988 ) investigated whether plasma instabilities might enhance the coupling and drive the plasma rapidly to a single temperature ; this would be problematic for the adaf solution .",
    "however , they were unable to identify a clear mechanism .",
    "for normal mass accretion rates , the electrons in a two - temperature adaf will have a thermal energy distribution ( but not necessarily the ions , see mahadevan & quataert 1997 ) .",
    "early work on two - temperature adafs assumed that viscous heating acts primarily on the ions ; for instance , ny95b took the ratio of electron heating to total heating , @xmath46 , to be zero , while esin , mcclintock & narayan ( 1997 ) assumed @xmath47 .",
    "however , an adaf does not _ require _ @xmath46 to be this small .",
    "because of a degeneracy in model parameters ( quataert & narayan 1999 ) , it is possible to have a viable adaf model with larger values of @xmath46 , provided the mass loss parameter @xmath48 , defined in  3.6 , is adjusted .",
    "more recent adaf models ( e.g. , yuan , quataert & narayan 2003 ) typically assume @xmath49 .",
    "various attempts have been made to estimate the value of @xmath46 from first principles by considering the effects of reconnection ( bisnovatyi - kogan & lovelace 1997 ; quataert & gruzinov 1999 ) or mhd turbulence ( quataert 1998 ; blackman 1999 ; medvedev 2000 ) .",
    "these studies do not agree on a single value of @xmath46 , but generally suggest that @xmath46 is likely to be much larger than @xmath50 .",
    "recently , sharma et al . ( 2007 ) considered heating by the dissipation of pressure anisotropy and showed that @xmath51 .",
    "it should be noted that , even if electrons and ions receive equal amounts of the dissipated energy ( i.e. , @xmath52 ) , the plasma can still be two - temperature .",
    "this is because a large part of the heating in an adaf is by compression ( since the density increases inward ) .",
    "once @xmath53 , which is the case for @xmath54 a few hundred , the electrons become relativistic and have an adiabatic index @xmath55 , whereas the ions continue to be non - relativistic with @xmath56 . since adiabatic heating by compression causes the temperature to scale as @xmath57 , the electrons heat up only as @xmath58 whereas the ions heat up as @xmath59 .",
    "thus , even in the limiting case of @xmath60 , adafs naturally become two - temperature at small radii . for instance , in the adaf model of sagittarius a@xmath3 ( sgr a@xmath3 ) proposed by yuan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , the authors obtain @xmath61 close to the bh even though they assumed @xmath62 .",
    "an important property of the adaf solution is that it is thermally stable ( ny95b ; wu & li 1996 ; kato et al .",
    "1997 ; wu 1997 ) .",
    "the demonstration of this property was a crucial advance .",
    "two decades earlier , in a seminal paper , shapiro , lightman & eardley ( 1976 ) , and after them rees et al .",
    "( 1982 ; ion tori ) , introduced the idea of a two - temperature accretion flow and derived a hot two - temperature accretion flow solution , the sle solution .",
    "however , that solution turned out to be thermally unstable ( piran 1978 ) .",
    "until the development of the adaf solution , and the recognition that it is different from the sle solution , no stable , hot , optically thin solution was available to model the many accretion systems whose spectra ( especially in the hard state , see below ) demand such a flow .",
    "chen et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and yuan ( 2003 ) have explored the relationships among the adaf / riaf , sle , adaf / slim disk and thin disk solutions .",
    "the adaf is a full accretion solution which incorporates consistent dynamics , thermal balance , radiation physics , etc .",
    "therefore , the radial profiles of all gas properties can be calculated self - consistently once we know the values of certain parameters : bh mass @xmath63 , accretion rate @xmath64 , viscosity parameter @xmath33 , pressure parameter @xmath65 , adiabatic index @xmath34 ( usually @xmath66 ) , viscous heating parameter @xmath46 , advection parameter @xmath67 .    actually , apart from the system - specific parameters @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( which may be estimated through observation ) , most of the other parameters are constrained . under the nearly collisionless conditions expected in an adaf , the viscosity parameter is moderately enhanced relative to a collisional gas ( sharma et al .",
    "2006 ) . in the case of dwarf novae in the hot state , smak ( 1999 )",
    "estimates @xmath68 , while numerical simulations of the magneto - rotational instability give @xmath69 ( hawley , gammie & balbus 1996 ) .",
    "thus we expect @xmath30 for an adaf ( typical values used in models are @xmath70 ) .",
    "numerical simulations further suggest that magnetic fields are generally subthermal , with @xmath71 ( e.g. , hawley et al . 1996 ) , so we expect @xmath72 . by calculating the energy loss via radiation from the hot accretion flow ( synchrotron , bremsstrahlung , compton scattering ) ,",
    "@xmath67 can be obtained self - consistently ( e.g. , ny95b ; narayan , barret & mcclintock 1997a ; esin et al .",
    "1997 ; yuan et al .",
    "thus , we have only one poorly constrained parameter : @xmath46 . the recent work of sharma et al .",
    "( 2007 ) provides a serviceable prescription even for this parameter . at large radii , where the plasma is effectively one - temperature , their formula gives @xmath73 , while in the energetically important inner region , where the plasma is two - temperature , they find @xmath74 , depending on model details .",
    "the final two parameters are discussed later : the transition radius @xmath75 ,  3.5 , and the wind parameter @xmath48 ,  3.6 .    .",

    "1998),width=316 ]    since the earliest days of x - ray astronomy , it has been clear that bh binaries ( bhbs ) have a number of distinct spectral states ( see zdziarski & gierlinski 2004 ; mcclintock & remillard 2006 ; done et al .",

    "( this is not surprising , since the gas is not losing energy through radiation . ) therefore , the above authors suggested that adafs should be associated with strong winds and jets ( see also meier 2001 ) .",
    "strong outflows have been seen in numerical simulations of adafs .",
    "the first indications came from 2d and 3d hydrodynamic simulations ( stone , pringle & begelman 1999 ; igumenshchev & abramowicz 2000 ; igumenshchev , abramowicz & narayan 2000 ) , but it was soon confirmed in mhd simulations as well ( stone & pringle 2001 ; hawley & balbus 2002 ; igumenshchev , narayan & abramowicz 2003 ; pen , matzner & wong 2003 ; machida , nakamura & matsumoto 2004 ; mckinney & gammie 2004 ; igumenshchev 2004 ) .",
    "apart from producing a gas - dominated , large - scale outflow , mhd simulations of adafs also have a second distinct outflow component along the axis in the form of a collimated , poynting - dominated , relativistic jet ( mckinney 2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "the original suggestion of ny94 that adafs would have outflows and jets has thus been confirmed by these simulations .",
    "nevertheless , some authors have disputed a connection between a positive bernoulli parameter and an outflow since it is possible to come up with explicit models that have a positive bernoulli parameter but no outflow ( paczyski 1998 ; abramowicz et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "observational evidence for the association of nonthermal relativistic jets with adafs has accumulated in recent years with the discovery of radio emission in virtually every bhb in the hard state ( corbel et al .",
    "2000 ; fender 2001 ; fender , belloni & gallo 2004 ; fender & belloni 2004 ) .",
    "the radio emission is generally too bright to be produced by thermal electrons in the accretion flow .",
    "it is therefore very likely to come from nonthermal electrons in a jet ; in fact , radio vlbi imaging has revealed a resolved jet in a few sources .",
    "thus , it is now observationally well - established that the hard state / adaf is associated with relativistic jets . according to the discussion in  3.5",
    ", the quiescent state also has an adaf and should have a ( weaker ) jet .",
    "indeed , radio emission has been seen from two quiescent systems , v404 cyg ( hjellming et al .",
    "2000 ; gallo , fender & hynes 2005 ) and a062000 ( gallo et al . 2006 ) , confirming this expectation .",
    "how much of the x - ray emission in an adaf system comes from the accretion flow and how much from the jet ?",
    "a strong correlation has been seen between radio and x - ray luminosity in the hard state and quiescent state ( corbel et al .",
    "2003 ; gallo , fender & pooley 2003 ) . at first sight",
    "this might suggest that the x - ray must also come from the jet ( e.g. , falcke , krding & markoff 2004 ) .",
    "however , since the jet flows out of the adaf and is thus highly coupled to it , any model in which the x - ray emission is from the adaf and radio is from the jet is equally compatible with the observations . in recent times ,",
    "several authors have come down in favor of an adaf origin for the x - rays ( e.g. , heinz & sunyaev 2003 ; merloni , heinz & di matteo 2003 ; heinz 2004 ; heinz et al .",
    "2005 ; yuan et al .",

    "additional evidence on this issue comes from hard state spectra indicating thermal emission ( e.g. , see fig .",
    "1 ) , which is very different from the nonthermal power - law emission one expects from a jet .",
    "markoff , falcke & fender ( 2001 ) , among others , have argued that the x - ray emission is due to synchrotron emission from a carefully tuned distrubution of nonthermal electrons .",
    "however , zdziarski et al . ( 2003 ) and zdziarski & gierlinski ( 2004 ) showed that the high - energy cutoff in the spectra of bhbs in the hard state , which arises naturally in a thermal adaf - like model , is very difficult to reproduce in a nonthermal synchrotron model .",
    "a variant of the jet model assigns the x - ray emission to thermal electrons in the `` base of the jet '' ( markoff , nowak & wilm 2005 ) , but the discussion then becomes semantic .",
    "the base of the jet is surely embedded in the underlying adaf and it is not clear that one gains anything by simply relabeling the radiation from the adaf as jet emission .",
    "the issue is discussed in greater depth in narayan ( 2005 ) , who advocates a ` jet - adaf ' model ( as described in yuan et al . 2005 ; malzac , merloni & fabian 2004 ) , in which the high energy x - ray emission in the hard state comes from the adaf and the low - energy radio ( and infrared ) emission comes from a jet .",
    "the situation is less clear - cut in the quiescent state , where nonthermal emission from the jet might dominate even in x - rays ( yuan & cui 2005 ; wu , yuan & cao 2007 ) .",
    "it is interesting , however , that the most quiescent system we know , sgr a@xmath3 , shows no sign of a jet .",
    "radio images with a resolution of @xmath110 appear to be jet - free ( shen et al . 2005 ) , while the quiescent x - ray emission is spatially resolved and appears to be from thermal gas near the bondi radius at @xmath111 , not from a jet ( baganoff et al .",
    "2001 , 2003 ) .",
    "turning our attention now to the extended wind that is predicted from an adaf , and seen in numerical simulations , one consequence of the wind is that , at each radius , a fraction of the accreting gas is lost from the system .",
    "thus , the accretion rate itself varies with radius .",
    "this is usually parameterized with an index @xmath48 such that @xmath112 .",
    "operationally , this means that , in the self - similar regime , the gas density varies with radius as @xmath113 rather than as @xmath114 in the ny94 model .",
    "unfortunately , apart from the rather general constraint that @xmath48 should lie between 0 ( no mass loss ) and 1 ( the limit of a cdaf ,  3.7 ) , there is no good theoretical estimate of the value of @xmath48 .",
    "we have to resort to numerical simulations or observations .",
    "the former tends to give somewhat larger values , e.g. , @xmath115 ( pen et al .",
    "2003 ) , while the one case where the latter approach has been tried , sgr a@xmath3 , yields a smaller value , @xmath116 ( yuan et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "another general property of adafs was highlighted by ny94 ( see also begelman & meier 1982 ) : adafs have entropy increasing inward and should be convectively unstable by the schwarzschild criterion .",
    "numerical hydrodynamic simulations of adafs confirmed the presence of strong convection ( igumenshchev et al .",
    "2000 ; narayan , igumenshchev & abramowicz 2000 ) and led to the development of an analytical self - similar model called the convection - dominated accretion flow ( cdaf ; narayan et al .",
    "2000 ; quataert & gruzinov 2000 ) .",
    "the cdaf model employs a simplified one - dimensional treatment of the accretion flow , in which all fluxes are assumed to be in the radial direction .",
    "the resulting density varies as @xmath117 . in the language of  3.6",
    ", a cdaf corresponds to @xmath118 .",
    "however , technically , an idealized cdaf has no mass outflow , only an outward flow of energy by convection ; the energy is assumed to flow out into a surrounding medium . in practice , the flow is never perfectly one - dimensional ; 2d effects intrude and one expects substantial winds and mass loss as well .",
    "a real adaf thus involves a complicated interplay between convection and winds .",
    "magnetic fields introduce further complexity , and there has been some discussion in the literature on whether mhd adafs do or do not have real convection ( machida , matsumoto & mineshige 2001 ; balbus & hawley 2002 ; narayan et al .",
    "2002b ; pen et al .",
    "2003 ; igumenshchev 2004 ) .",
    "the question has no practical significance , however , since there is general agreement that adafs have both unstable entropy gradients and strong magnetic stresses .    in the particular case of a spherical , non - rotating , mhd flow ( the magnetic analog of the bondi problem ) , some complications are absent and the problem becomes relatively clean .",
    "here one finds that convection and magnetic fields strongly influence the accretion physics , and the resulting flow is very different from the standard bondi solution ( igumenshchev & narayan 2002 ; igumenshchev 2004 , 2006 ) .",
    "this result is likely to have significant implications for astrophysics ; for instance , isolated neutron stars accreting from the interstellar medium will be very much dimmer than one might expect based on the bondi solution ( perna et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the adaf solution is essentially independent of the mass @xmath63 of the central bh .",
    "that is , if length and time are scaled by @xmath63 and the accretion rate is scaled by the eddington rate ( also proportional to @xmath63 ) , then the same solution is valid for any bh mass .",
    "therefore , any successful application of the adaf model to a bhb system has immediate consequences for supermassive bhs ( smbhs ) in an equivalent state , and vice versa .",
    "this close connection between adafs in bhbs and adafs in agn was highlighted in narayan ( 1996 ) ; it is also empirically obvious from fig .",
    "6 , which combines observations and models of bhbs and agn .",
    "the first smbh to be modeled as an adaf was the galactic center source sgr a@xmath3 ( narayan et al .",
    "this was soon followed by fabian & rees ( 1995 ) , who suggested that quiescent nuclei in nearby giant ellipticals ( e.g. , m87 ) must be accreting via adafs , and by lasota et al .",
    "( 1996a ) , who argued that low ionization nuclear emission - line region sources ( liners , e.g. , ngc 4258 ) and low - luminosity active galactic nuclei ( llagn ) must have adafs .",

    "all of these sources are relatively low - luminosity agn , where an adaf is likely to be present ( figs . 5 , 6 ) .",
    "as discussed in  3.6 , a feature of the adaf model is the presence of outflows and jets .",
    "this implies that adaf systems should generally be radio - loud .",
    "this is certainly the case for the fri and bl lac sources mentioned above .",

    "moreover , the degree of radio loudness increases with decreasing eddington ratio , again consistent with our expectation that the adaf should become more and more dominant with decreasing @xmath64 . the majority of sources in ho s plot that have @xmath119 are radio - quiet , as we would expect from fig .",

    "the jet and the extended wind from an adaf carry with them substantial kinetic energy .",
    "this energy will be dumped into the external medium and will have important consequences . in the context of galaxy formation , there has been discussion recently of the so - called `` radio mode '' of accretion ( croton et al .",

    "further observations are needed to determine the origin of optical / uv emission in these systems .",
    "in addition to the arguments discussed above , we briefly summarize three additional lines of evidence for the existence of event horizons .",

    "as in the examples above , the first argument considers quiescent systems , whereas the latter two consider active states of accretion .    in quiescence ,",
    "a soft component of thermal emission is very commonly observed from the surfaces of accreting nss , which is widely attributed to either deep crustal heating ( brown , bildsten & rutledge 1998 ) or to accretion .",
    "no such component is present in the spectrum of the quiescent bhb xte j1118 + 480 ( hereafter j1118 ) , as one would expect if the compact x - ray source is a bona fide bh that possesses an event horizon ( mcclintock et al .",

    "remillard et al .  ( 2006 ) , following earlier work by tournear et al . ( 2003 ) , measured the rates of type i x - ray bursts from a sample of 37 nonpulsing x - ray transients observed with _ rxte _ during 19962004 . among the ns sources",

    "their upper limit on the incidence of burst activity in these sources is inconsistent with the model predictions at a high statistical significance if the accretors in bhbs have solid surfaces .",
    "the results provide strong indirect evidence for bh event horizons , and it would appear that the evidence can be refuted only by invoking rather exotic physics .    likewise drawing on the extensive archive of _ rxte",

    "note that the discrepancy would be much larger if we assumed that the accretion flow is radiatively inefficient ( corresponding to the hatched region in fig .",

    ", we know that matter is being accreted at a rate @xmath161 ( shown by the horizontal dashed line in fig .",

    "the surface redshift can then be arbitrarily large : @xmath167 although the gravastar model is very artificial , it is nevertheless interesting to ask whether such a model , which has no event horizon , can explain the observations described in   4.2 , 4.5 ( abramowicz et al . 2002 ) .",
    "broderick & narayan ( 2006 , 2007 ) show that it can not .",
    "we briefly summarize the arguments here .",
    "a large value of @xmath168 means that any radiation emitted from the surface is redshifted greatly before it reaches the observer at infinity .",
    "this looks like an easy way of hiding the surface luminosity .",
    "however , a simple energy conservation argument shows otherwise . assuming steady state , in the limit as @xmath169 , the total luminosity observed at infinity , @xmath170 ,",
    "_ must _ be equal to @xmath135 ( the rate of accretion of rest mass energy ) .",
    "moreover , the effective radius of the source as viewed by a distant observer is @xmath171 , and so the surface radiation will be in the x - ray band for accreting bhbs (  4.2 ) and in the infrared for sgr a@xmath3 (  4.5 ) , exactly as in the newtonian analysis .",
    "could the large gravitational redshift cause a large delay in the signals from the surface of the star , and could this be why we do not see the radiation ?",
    "the extra delay due to relativity is easily estimated by considering null geodesics in the schwarzschild metric : @xmath172 since the dependence is only logarithmic , the extra delay is not significant .",
    "for instance , even if we take @xmath173 to be comparable to the planck length @xmath174 cm ( the smallest length we can legitimately consider ) , the delay is only @xmath175 ms for a bhb and @xmath176 s for sgr a@xmath3 .",
    "we assumed that the radiation from the surface would have a blackbody - like spectrum .",
    "is this likely ? actually , it is virtually guaranteed as @xmath177 .",
    "when the radius of an object is very close to the schwarzschild radius , most rays emitted from the surface are bent back on to the surface , and only a tiny fraction of rays escapes to infinity .",
    "the solid angle corresponding to escape is @xmath178 . in this limit",
    ", the surface behaves just like a furnace with a pinhole ( the textbook example of a blackbody ! ) , and so the escaping radiation is certain to have a nearly perfect blackbody spectrum .",
    "could the surface luminosity escape in the form of particles rather than radiation ? by the blackbody argument given above , whatever escapes must be in thermodynamic equilibrium at the temperature @xmath179 observed at infinity . for the sources of interest to us , @xmath180 ev ( sgr a@xmath3 ) and kev ( bhbs ) .",
    "in thermodynamic equilibrium , the only particles with any significant number density at these temperatures are neutrinos .",
    "even if we include all three species of neutrinos , the radiation flux is reduced by a factor of only 8/29 ( broderick & narayan 2007 ) .",
    "this is a small correction compared to the large discrepancies @xmath181 that we described in ",
    " 4.2 , 4.5 .",
    "finally , we note that our arguments for the event horizon are based on a steady state assumption .",
    "specifically , we assume that the surface luminosity is proportional to the average mass accretion rate on the surface . in the gravastar model , in particular , one can imagine scenarios in which steady state is not reached .",
    "however , broderick & narayan ( 2007 ) show that this explanation can be ruled out , at least with current gravastar models .",
    "we thus conclude that strong gravity effects are unable to weaken our arguments for the presence of an event horizon in quiescent bhbs and in sgr a@xmath3 .",
    "we must look to more conventional astrophysical explanations .",
    "the only idea that we find somewhat plausible is that the radiation we observe from quiescent x - ray binaries and sgr a@xmath3 is not produced by accretion at all , but by some other process .",
    "this would undercut all our arguments since we assume , as an article of faith , that the radiation we observe is powered by gravity through accretion .",
    "given the success of the accretion paradigm in explaining a vast body of observations on a variety of bh systems in many different spectral states , it seems rather extreme to abandon the idea of accretion in just those particular sources where we find evidence for the presence of an event horizon .",
    "the aim of this article is two - fold : to give an updated and current account of the adaf model , with an emphasis on applications to accreting bhs (  3 ) , and to review the considerable body of evidence presently available for the presence of event horizons in astrophysical bhs (  4 ) .",
    "observations of bh binaries ( bhbs ) and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) indicate that , at luminosities of a few percent or less of eddington , accretion occurs via a very different mode than the standard thin accretion disk . at these luminosities ,",
    "sources have hard x - ray spectra , quite unlike the soft blackbody - like spectra seen in more luminous sources .",
    "prior to the establishment of the adaf model , observations in the hard state were modeled in an ad hoc way using empirical thermal comptonization models . in the mid-1990s ,",
    "the adaf solution was shown to have precisely the densities , temperatures , radiative ( in)efficiencies  and stability  required to provide a physical description of the observations . moreover , since the adaf model is essentially mass - independent , observations of bhbs and agn are both explained with more - or - less the same adaf model .",
    "the model gives satisfactory results for a wide range of luminosity , from about @xmath182 down to @xmath183 of eddington ( below which there are no observations ) .",
    "the defining characteristic of an adaf is that the gas is not radiatively efficient .",
    "a significant fraction of the energy released by viscous dissipation is retained in the accreting gas and advected with the flow .",
    "the trapped thermal energy causes the accreting gas to be weakly bound to the bh .",
    "based on this property , it was predicted already in the earliest adaf papers that sources in the adaf state would have strong winds and jets .",
    "nonthermal radio emission has been detected in recent years from bhbs in the hard state and quiescent state , as well as from all agn with luminosities below @xmath184 of eddington .",

    "in contrast , the adaf model provides an entirely straightforward explanation for the faintness of quiescent bhs : a ns must radiate the trapped thermal radiation that is advected with the accretion flow and rains down on its surface , whereas the bh hides the energy behind its event horizon .",
    "additional evidence for the event horizon is provided in further comparisons of nss and bhs in outburst : the bhs lack type i x - ray bursts , and they lack a distinctive boundary - layer component of emission .",
    "both of these properties are expected if the bhs possess event horizons , but hard to explain otherwise .",
    "the supermassive bh in sgr a@xmath3 is extraordinarily quiescent .",
    "the observations strongly support the existence of an adaf , and it is consequently easy to provide a compelling argument for an event horizon .",
    "however , for sgr a@xmath3 , one can make an even stronger argument for the lack of a hypothetical material surface without at all invoking an adaf .",
    "the large radio / millimeter accretion luminosity of sgr a@xmath3 , which has a brightness temperature @xmath187 k , obviously can not be emitted by an optically - thick surface , and so it must be radiated from the accretion flow .",
    "this establishes a hard lower limit on the accretion luminosity and @xmath64 .",
    "meanwhile , high angular resolution radio observations constrain the radius of the surface to be @xmath188 .",
    "this constraint and the lower limit on @xmath185 predict a near - ir flux of thermal , blackbody - like surface emission that is far above the observed limits .",
    "the obvious explanation is that there is no material surface , only an event horizon . as an added bonus ,",
    "it is energetically impossible to explain away the lack of surface emission by appealing to mass loss in a jet .",
    "the case for event horizons in both sgr a@xmath3 and in the stellar - mass bhs is robust against appeals to strong gravity or the leading models of exotic stars .",
    "first , gr effects will be mild for nearly all conventional models of degenerate stars , whose radii are restricted to be @xmath189 and whose surface redshifts are therefore @xmath190 .",
    "secondly , even for an exotic star ( a gravastar ) with an extraordinary surface redshift of a million or more , the full accretion luminosity from its surface will be delivered as x - rays ( in binaries ) or infrared ( in sgr a@xmath3 ) to a distant observer .",
    "thus , extreme redshifts have practically no effect on the argument for the event horizon .    to play on carl sagan s famous comment",
    ", there will always be an absence of _ direct _ evidence for the event horizon , but this surely can not be taken as evidence of its absence in nature . on the contrary , and with a pun in mind , many indicators show that the event horizon is an inescapable reality ."
