    "the description of electronic and magnetic properties of upd@xmath2al@xmath3 is still under hot debate though its exotic properties has been discovered already more than 10 years ago [ 1 ] .",
    "the uniqueness of upd@xmath2al@xmath3 relies in the coexistence of the heavy - fermion ( h - f ) phenomena and the large magnetic moment of about 1.5 @xmath5 ( t@xmath6 = 14.3 k ) as well as superconductivity below 2 k. the main point of the debate is related to the understanding of the role played by @xmath7 electrons . in the band calculations these electrons are considered as itinerant [ 2,3 ] whereas surprisingly nice reproduction of many experimental results can be obtained within the crystal - field ( cef ) approach , i.e. treating f electrons as localized [ 1,4,5,6 ] . however , within the cef approach there is presently discussion about the tetravalent [ 1,4,7,8 ] or trivalent [ 5,6 ] uranium state in upd@xmath2al@xmath3 . as a great progress towards the consensus about the f electrons in heavy - fermion compounds",
    "we take the drastic change of the physical mind of fulde and zwicknagl , who advocating for years for all f electrons itinerant now propagate a model with a dual nature of f electrons , two of which are localized [ 8 ] .    the u@xmath1 ion is a kramers @xmath8 system having the kramers doublet ground state .",
    "the fine electronic structure of the u@xmath1 ion consists of five kramers doublets as the effect of charge interactions .",
    "these doublets are split in the antiferromagnetic state , i.e. below t@xmath6 of 14 k in case of upd@xmath2al@xmath3 .",
    "we have found [ 6 ] that the localized excitations revealed by inelastic - neutron - scattering experiments of krimmel et al . [",
    "9 ] are in reasonable agreement with our earlier predictions for the u@xmath1 state .",
    "the motivation for this paper is to provide further arguments for the existence of the localized @xmath9-electron states of the u@xmath1 configuration and to provide consistent explanation for properties of nppd@xmath2al@xmath3 . in the trivalent uranium state",
    "we follow our very early explanation of the overall temperature dependence of the specific heat with localized states associated with the u@xmath1 configuration [ 5 ] .",
    "our solution is along the line of our consequent long - lasting approach to transition - metal compounds underlying the importance of the crystal field , including heavy - fermion compounds .",
    "one of us ( rjr ) bears with the proudness a nick - name of mister crystal field given by v. sechovsky in 1991 , i.e. in years , when the use of the crystal - field was largely discriminated within magnetic and heavy - fermion community .",
    "it is worth to remind that 10 years ago the crystal - field topic was simply expelled from the strongly correlated electron systems conference .",
    "the inelastic - neutron - scattering experiments [ 9 ] have revealed at 25 k the existence of the crystal - field excitations with energies of 7 and 23.4 mev .",
    "this experiment at 150 k has revealed further excitations at 3 and 14 mev at the energy - loss side and at 7 mev at the energy - gain side .",
    "we have interpreted these excitations as related to the energy level scheme : 0 , 7 ( 81 k ) , 10 ( 116 k ) and 23.4 ( 271 k ) and we have ascribed this scheme to the @xmath0 ( u@xmath1 ) scheme . there",
    "the specific - heat analysis [ 5 ] has yielded the energy levels at 0 , 100 , 150 , 350 and 600 k. all of them are kramers doublets . we have noticed in ref . [",
    "6 ] that the ins scheme is similar to that derived from specific heat analysis provided that the energy scheme is reduced by about 80 percent .",
    "we have derived a new set of cef parameters of the hexagonal symmetry : b@xmath10=+5.3 k , b@xmath11=+40 mk , b@xmath12=-0.02 mk and b@xmath13=-26 mk .    for the description of electronic and magnetic properties we have applied a single - ion like hamiltonian for the ground multiplet j=9/2 [ 6 ] :    @xmath14    the first term is the crystal - field hamiltonian.the second term takes into account the intersite spin - dependent interactions that produce e.g. the magnetic order below t@xmath6 what is seen in fig . 1 as the appearance of the splitting of the kramers doublet .",
    "the derived electronic structure is shown in fig .",
    "1 . the derived parameters yield states at 81 k , 120 k , 270 k and 460 k. these energies are in very good agreement with the ins data .",
    "the highest state was not observed in ins experiment .",
    "this scheme yields the specific heat that has very similar shape as in ref .",
    "5 , a maximum is only shifted to lower temperatures by about 10 k , but we think that it is within the experimental accuracy . such good description of both thermodynamical property ( specific heat ) and spectroscopic excitations we take as very strong confirmation of the @xmath0 ( u@xmath1 ) state in upd@xmath2al@xmath15 .",
    "we are convinced that the derived u@xmath1 state in upd@xmath2al@xmath3 is consistent with the trivalent np state in the isostructural nppd@xmath2al@xmath3 derived by the mossbauer spectroscopy [ 10 ] . in order to exploit further the cef theory we recalculate cef parameters from upd@xmath16al@xmath15 to nppd@xmath2al@xmath3 using single - ion theory , i.e. making use of the stevens coefficients .",
    "we found the cef parameters for np@xmath1 : b@xmath10=-5.7 k , b@xmath11=-50 mk , b@xmath12=+0.027 mk and b@xmath13=-36 mk .",
    "the resulting energy level scheme is shown in fig .",
    "these parameters yield the magnetic moment direction of the np@xmath1 ion to lie along the hexagonal c axis , i.e. the perpendicular to the uranium moment .",
    "exactly as is observed .",
    "however , the moment value amounts to 2.2 @xmath4 that is larger than a mossbauer estimation of 1.6 @xmath4 [ 10 ] . we manage to reduce the value of the magnetic moment , not loosing the c - axis direction by increasing the value of the b@xmath13=-36 mk parameter to b@xmath13=-100 mk . with this value",
    "we get magnetic moment of 1.6 @xmath4 in the paramagnetic state and 1.79 @xmath4 in the ordered state , fig .",
    "we consider the shown parameters to be quite close to the real situation , however , more experiments are awaited , in particular the observation of the highest state in the inelastic - neutron - scattering experiment .",
    "it is pointed out that the experimentally - observed crystal - field excitations in the heavy - fermion superconductor upd@xmath2al@xmath3 are consistent with the u@xmath1 state .",
    "it makes upd@xmath2al@xmath3 to be the second , apart upd@xmath3 , uranium compound in which cef states have been unambiguously revealed .",
    "the existence of the localized @xmath7 states in heavy - fermion superconductor upd@xmath2al@xmath3 is taken as a strong support for the validity of the crystal - field model for the h - f phenomena in which the crystal - field realization of the kramers - doublet ground state is the basic ingredient .",
    "the derived u@xmath1 state in upd@xmath2al@xmath3 is consistent with the trivalent np state in the isostructural nppd@xmath2al@xmath3 derived by the mossbauer spectroscopy .",
    "our set of cef for upd@xmath16al@xmath15 yields the magnetic moment direction of the np@xmath1 to lie along the hexagonal c axis , i.e. perpendicularly to the uranium moment , exactly as is experimentally observed .",
    "description of so many different properties of upd@xmath2al@xmath3 and successful prediction of the magnetic properties of nppd@xmath2al@xmath3 we take as being not coincidence only but as indication of large physical adequacy of the developed by us the quantum atomistic solid state theory ( quasst ) [ 11,12 ] .",
    "quasst points out the necessity of discussion of electronic and magnetic properties on the atomic scale where the local symmetry , crystal field and strong electron correlations , of intra - atomic and inter - site origin , plays the fundamental role in formation of the low - energy discrete energy spectrum .",
    "the experiment by krimmel _",
    "[ 9 ] we regard as a mile stone in the experimental confirmation of the quasst theory for intermetallic , where localized and itinerant ( conduction ) electrons coexist ."
