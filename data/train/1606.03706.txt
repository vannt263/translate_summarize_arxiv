    "thus , sequence @xmath130 converges to a limit @xmath131 .",
    "therefore , @xmath132 . in other words , every surface in the @xmath2-orbit closure of @xmath5 actually belongs to the orbit of @xmath5 .",
    "if the veech group of a flat surface with poles of higher order @xmath5 is of continuous type , then @xmath112 is closed ( theorem 2.3 ) .",
    "as @xmath2 is a closed subgroup of @xmath1 , @xmath133 is closed too .",
    "this covers situations where all saddle connections of @xmath21 share the same direction and @xmath18 is degenerated",
    ".    then we consider surfaces @xmath5 such that all saddle connections of @xmath21 share the same direction @xmath88 and @xmath18 is not degenerated . without loss of generality",

    "we are going to use the iwasawa decomposition of @xmath2.every @xmath134 has a unique representation as @xmath135 where we have@xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 with @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "in particular , @xmath141 .",
    "every surface @xmath120 in the @xmath2-orbit closure of @xmath5 arises as the limit of a sequence @xmath142 where @xmath122 , we have @xmath143 . besides , @xmath144 , we have @xmath145 in the iwasawa decomposition .    first , @xmath146 is compact so there is @xmath147 and an increasing subsequence @xmath148 such that we have:@xmath149    we have @xmath150 .",
    "since all saddle connections of @xmath21 share the same direction , if there is an increasing subsequence @xmath151 such that @xmath152 , then the length of the longest saddle connection in the boundary of the core of @xmath153 grows to infinity .",
    "therefore , @xmath154 is bounded .",
    "for the same reasons ( no saddle connection can shrink to saddle connection of zero length ) , @xmath154 is bounded below by a positive number .",
    "that is why there is @xmath155 and an increasing subsequence @xmath156 such that @xmath157.to recapitulate , we get an increasing subsequence @xmath158 such that we have : @xmath159    therefore , the @xmath2-orbit of @xmath5 is closed if and only if its @xmath160-orbit is closed where @xmath161 .",
    "if @xmath18 decomposes into finite volume cylinders with commensurable moduli , then the veech group of @xmath5 is of cyclic parabolic type ( proposition 4.2 ) and the @xmath160-orbit of @xmath5 is closed .",
    "then , its @xmath2-orbit is closed too .",
    "the last case is about surfaces @xmath5 such that all saddle connections of @xmath21 share the same direction ( without loss of generality , we suppose this is the vertical direction ) and @xmath18 does not decompose into a family of cylinders of commensurable moduli .",
    "either there is a minimal component or two cylinders whose moduli are not commensurable .",
    "following proposition 4.2 , the veech group of such a surface @xmath5 is not of cyclic parabolic type and its @xmath160-orbit is not periodic.let @xmath162 be the interior of @xmath18 .",
    "since the boundary of @xmath162 is made of vertical saddle connections whose total holonomy is zero , we can glue the boundary components on each other while adding marked points if necessary or modifying the order of the conical singularities .",
    "we get a flat surface @xmath163 without poles of higher order but with some marked vertical saddle connections ( those that have been glued on each other ) .",
    "flat surface @xmath163 belongs to a stratum @xmath31 of meromorphic quadratic differentials with at most simple poles.no saddle connection shrinks under the action of @xmath160 .",
    "thus , lengths of saddle connections remain bounded below by a positive number all along the orbit .",
    "therefore @xmath164 lies in a compact subset of @xmath31 .",
    "so if @xmath164 is closed , then it is also compact and consquently @xmath164 is a periodic orbit . however , as the action of @xmath160 preserve the marked vertical saddle connections , the fact that @xmath165 is not periodic implies that @xmath164 is not periodic either .",
    "therefore , @xmath164 is not closed . as the action of @xmath160",
    "preserve the marked vertical saddle connections , the @xmath160-orbit of @xmath5 is not closed either .",
    "consequently , the @xmath2-orbit of @xmath5 is not closed in this case .",
    "this ends the proof .",
    "just as flat surfaces of finite area , the typical flat surface with poles of higher order has a trivial veech group .",
    "theorem 2.4 provides a similar result to what mller proved in @xcite . as a result of our definition of a veech group",
    ", we do not have to deal with hyperellipticity .",
    "first , we distinguish three kinds of chambers according to the shape of the core:- chambers of the first kind , such that the core is not degenerated and its boundary is a unique closed saddle connection or a pair of parallel saddle connections.- chambers of the second kind , such that the core is a unique saddle connection ( in particular , the core is degenerated).- chambers of the third kind otherwise.we first deal with chambers of the second kind .",
    "chambers of the second kind are rare because @xmath166 is a lower bound on the number of saddle connections of a surface of genus @xmath10 with @xmath167 conical singularities and @xmath85 poles of higher order provided @xmath14 ( see theorem 3.2 ) .",
    "surfaces with a unique saddle connection can only exist if @xmath13 and @xmath168 and we assume in this paper that @xmath14 .",
    "automorphisms of the sphere allow to fix three points so there is a unique surface up to scaling in strata such that @xmath32 .",
    "all these surfaces have a unique saddle connection so their veech group is of continuous type .    for a flat surface @xmath5 that belongs to a chamber of the third kind",
    ", we look for two saddle connections of @xmath21 whose holonomy vectors can be deformed independently from each other .",
    "is should be recalled that saddle connections of @xmath21 have no interior intersections.following lemma 3.3 and lemma 3.4 , if the holonomy vectors of two saddle connections @xmath69 and @xmath169 can not be deformed independently from each other , then their union @xmath170 cuts out @xmath3 into several components one of which has trivial linear holonomy .",
    "the only case where all saddle connections of @xmath21 are parallel is covered by chambers of the first kind ( one unique saddle connection or two parallel saddle connections).if the holonomy vectors of @xmath21 are not dependent from each other ( if there are at least two parameters of deformation ) , then a generic choice of periods will provide an irrational angle between the direction of a saddle connection @xmath69 and all the other saddle connections of @xmath21 that are independant from @xmath69 . since saddle connections that are not independant from @xmath69 share the same direction ( lemma 3.3 ) , then such a configuration forbids a veech group other than trivial .",
    "therefore , the generic surface in a chamber of the third kind has a trivial veech group .",
    "we come back to chambers of the first kind .",
    "since saddle connections of the boundary of the core share the same direction and the core is not degenerated , flat surfaces that belong to such chambers have a veech group that is either trivial or of cyclic parabolic type ( see theorem 2.1).following proposition 4.2 , a flat surface @xmath5 that belongs to such a chamber has a veech group of cyclic parabolic type if and only if @xmath18 splits into a finite number of cylinders with commensurable moduli in the direction of the saddle connection of @xmath21 .",
    "if there are at least two cylinders in such a decomposition , we can broaden those cylinders in order to realize every ratio of moduli without leaving the chamber . in accordance with definitions of @xcite",
    ", we say that a flat surface @xmath5 is generic in its stratum ( or its chamber ) if it lies outside a countable union of real codimension one submanifolds .",
    "there is a neighborhood of @xmath5 in the stratum such that the locus of surfaces whose veech group is of cyclic parabolic type is a countable union of real codimension one submanifolds ( corresponding to commensurable moduli ) .",
    "therefore , outside the locus of surfaces @xmath5 where @xmath18 is a unique cylinder , having a trivial veech group is a generic property .",
    "let @xmath5 be a surface such that @xmath18 decomposes into a unique cylinder for the flow in the direction of the saddle connections of @xmath21 .",
    "without loss of generality , we suppose that saddle connections of @xmath21 are vertical .",
    "we should recall that the boundary of the cylinder does not necessarily coincide with the boundary of the core because there can be conical singularities in the interior of @xmath18 .",
    "if not all saddle connections of the boundary of the cylinder are parallel , then a generic perturbation of periods will produce a surface such that the decomposition into invariant components in the vertical direction is no longer merely a cylinder .",
    "thus , in the neighborhood of such a flat surface @xmath5 in the stratum , having a trivial veech group is a generic property .    from now , we consider flat surfaces @xmath5 such that:- @xmath21 is a unique saddle connection or a pair of parallel saddle connections.- @xmath18 decomposes into a unique cylinder for the flow in the direction of the saddle connections of @xmath21.- all saddle connections of the boundary of the cylinder are parallel.outside this locus @xmath171 , the generic surface has a trivial veech group.we note that this locus is an open set in which the veech group of every surface is of cyclic parabolic type ( proposition 4.2 ) .",
    "such loci exist only in bidimensional strata .",
    "indeed , there are only two independant complex parameters ( periods of the parallel saddle connections of the boundary of the cylinder and the parameter prescribing the volume and the twist of the cylinder).a stratum @xmath6 of flat surfaces of genus @xmath10 is bidimensional if and only if @xmath13 and @xmath172 or @xmath173 .",
    "besides , there are at most two saddle connections in @xmath21 so we have @xmath174 .    in surfaces of genus zero , cutting along a waist curve of the cylinder",
    "splits the surface into two connected components .",
    "waist curves have a topological degree equal to zero so the sum of the orders of the singularities of each connected component is @xmath175 .",
    "thus , we have two types of strata of surfaces of genus zero:- @xmath25 with @xmath26- @xmath27 with @xmath28we have to add to them strata @xmath29 with @xmath30 ( because @xmath176 is empty ) to get all strata in which some surfaces belong to locus @xmath171 .    in strata",
    "@xmath25 with @xmath26 , for surfaces that belong to locus @xmath171 , cutting along a waist curve of the cylinder separates the domain of the pole of order @xmath177 ( whose boundary is a unique closed saddle connection passing through the conical singularity of order @xmath178 ) from the domain the pole of order @xmath179 ( whose boundary is a unique closed saddle connection passing through the conical singularity of order @xmath180 ) .",
    "this qualitative shape of the core defines chambers .",
    "every surface that belongs to these chambers is also in @xmath171.in strata @xmath27 with @xmath28 , for surfaces that belong to locus @xmath171 , cutting along a waist curve of the cylinder separates the domain of the pole of order @xmath177 ( whose boundary is a unique closed saddle connection passing through the conical singularity of order @xmath178 ) from a saddle connection connecting the two simple poles .",
    "this qualitative shape of the core also defines chambers .",
    "every surface that belongs to these chambers is also in @xmath171.in strata @xmath29 , every surface that belongs to locus @xmath171 belongs to chambers such that the core is not degenerated and its boundary is a unique closed saddle connection or a pair of parallel saddle connections ( chambers of the first kind as stated above ) .",
    "for every flat surface @xmath5 in such a chamber , if we decompose @xmath18 in the direction of the saddle connections of @xmath21 , we get exactly one invariant component .",
    "indeed , there is at least one invariant component because all saddle connections of the boundary share the same direction and @xmath18 is not degenerated .",
    "there is at most one invariant component because of theorem 3.5 .",
    "this invariant component is necessarily a cylinder because if it were a minimal component , there would be an additional parameter other than periods of the parallel saddle connections of @xmath21 and the parameter prescribing the volume and the twist of the invariant component .",
    "therefore , surfaces of @xmath29 that belong to locus @xmath171 coincide with chambers such that the core is not degenerated and their boundary is a unique closed saddle connection or a pair of parallel saddle connections .",
