    "in the early stage of reionization of the universe , radiation from the first generation of stars ionizes neutron hydrogen and helium to produce ionized bubbles around these stars .",
    "the subsequent growing , overlapping and merging of these isolated ionized patches lead to a full reionization of the universe .",
    "the evolution of the reionization depends on the birth rate of the first stars and the formation of ionized regions around these sources .",
    "the growth of ionized hii volume is directly related to the formation of 21 cm emission and absorption regions at the reionization epoch ( e.g. cen 2006 ; alvarez et al . 2006 ; chuzoy et al . 2006 ; liu et al .",
    "the planning and ongoing projects of detecting redshifted 21 cm signals are trying to reconstruct the redshift evolution of the reionized volume .",
    "therefore , a detailed study on the merging of ionized regions is necessary .",
    "the growth of the ionized hii volume , @xmath12 , is usually described by a rate equation ( e.g. shapiro & giroux 1987 ; madau , haardt & rees 1999 ; mellema et al .",

    "that is , the growth of the ionized volume is proportional to the emission rate of ionizing photons @xmath17 , regardless of whether the ionizing photons are produced from one source with emission rate @xmath17 or from @xmath22 sources with emission rate @xmath23 .",
    "the linear relation between @xmath20 and @xmath17 has been used in the simulations of the reionization ( e.g. ciardi et al .",
    "2003 ; iliev et al .",
    "that is , the effects of the photon kinetics in the phase space are completely ignored .",
    "a basic assumption of equation ( 1 ) is that photons emitted from the sources will immediately join the action with the atom , regardless of the photon propagation between the source and the atom .",
    "this assumption is reasonable if the time scale of the photon kinetics is much smaller than that of the problem considered .",

    "that is , for each point source , we plot a sphere around the source with radius @xmath129 corresponding to its intensity , two sources with overlapped spheres can be identified as a cluster consisting of the two sources . repeatedly applying the method to each pair of sources , one",
    "can then identify a cluster consisting of all the sources of which the @xmath129 spheres are connected . for this cluster , the ionized volume growth can be approximately described by a single source of @xmath7 , where @xmath5 is the intensity of source @xmath8 .",
    "we have developed the weno algorithm to solve radiative transfer equation beyond one physical dimension , which can precisely reveal the features of the merging of the ionized regions of uv photon sources .",
    "we show that the growth of the ionized volume around either one or two point sources generally consists of three phases : fast growth phase at the early evolution , slow growth phase at the later evolution , and a transition phase between them .",
    "the transition time @xmath0 depends significantly on the intensity of the photon sources @xmath2 , approximately to be @xmath155 .",
    "most of the photons emitted by the ionizing sources would be delayed a time @xmath0 to contribute to the ionization .",

    "the growth of the ionized volume of multiple isolated sources @xmath5 ( @xmath156 ) generally is much faster than that of a single source with intensity @xmath157 .    therefore , to calculate accurately the growth of the ionized volume at @xmath41 , one should not use eq.([eq1 ] ) , but take into account of the retardation of uv photons .",
    "this effect is more substantial if the first generation of stars are highly clustered .",
    "if the ionized spheres of these sources are merging in relativistic growth phase , the cluster would behave as a single source with intensity equal to the summation of intensities of these sources .",
    "therefore , tight clustering of uv sources will delay the development of reionization",
    ".    these results may already be useful in studying the 21 cm signals from the reionization epoch .",
    "it has been shown that a 21 cm emission and absorption region will develop around a point source once the speed of the ionization front ( i - front ) is significantly lower than the speed of light ( liu et al .",
    "the 21 cm region extends from the i - front to the front of light @xmath158 ; its inner part is the emission region and its outer part is the absorption region .",
    "therefore , the 21 cm region should be formed only at the time @xmath159 . since sources with weak intensity",
    "have small @xmath0 , while strong sources or tight clusters of weak sources have longer @xmath0 , sources with weak intensity produce 21 cm signal earlier , while strong sources , or tightly clustered weak sources produce it later .",
    "the results calculated from equation ( 1 ) will over - predict the ionization , and thus lead to less 21 cm signals . these features could be important to reconstruct the history of reionization with 21 cm tomography and/or cross correlation between redshifted 21 cm signals and emission on other bands from the center of the sources .    *",
