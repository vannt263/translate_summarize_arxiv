    "this isospin - invariant model was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and was developed to its final form by the mid 1990s .",
    "prior to fitting the eth model to the tdb@xmath28 , the data were subjected to a common fit using the @xmath63-matrix parameterisations .",
    "the tdb@xmath23 consisted of @xmath87 data points ( detailed in table 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , whereas the tdb@xmath26 comprised @xmath88 data points , i.e. , the original @xmath30 data points minus the five outliers detailed in table [ tab : op ] of this work .",
    "the common fit to these data using the @xmath63-matrix parameterisations resulted in the @xmath15 value of @xmath89 for @xmath90 dof and no additional outliers .",
    "the model fit to the data yielded the minimal @xmath15 value of @xmath91 for @xmath92 dof .",
    "the optimal values of the model parameters from the fit to the tdb@xmath28 are listed in table [ tab : modelparameters ] ; the uncertainties contain the birge factor @xmath93 , which takes account of the goodness of the fit .",
    "the table also contains the zuas12 solution for @xmath11 .",
    "the differences between these two sets of values are evident , especially for @xmath82 and @xmath84 .",
    "the correlation ( hessian ) matrix , obtained in the fit , is given in table [ tab : hessianmatrix ] .",
    "we now reflect on the final @xmath15 values obtained so far .",
    "we first concentrate on the results for @xmath11 .",
    "the separate fits to the data using the @xmath63-matrix parameterisations yielded the @xmath15 values of @xmath94 , @xmath95 @xcite , and @xmath77 ( this work ) for the tdb@xmath23 , tdb@xmath24 , and tdb@xmath26 , with @xmath30 , @xmath78 , and @xmath78 dof , respectively .",
    "the @xmath15 values obtained with the @xmath63-matrix parameterisations in the two analyses of the combined truncated databases ( i.e. , tdb@xmath27 and tdb@xmath28 ) come out very close to the sum of the corresponding results for the separate fits : @xmath96 ( instead of the sum of @xmath97 ) for the tdb@xmath27 @xcite and @xmath89 ( instead of the sum of @xmath98 ) for the tdb@xmath28 ( this work ) .",
    "( as the ndf in the tdb@xmath24 and tdb@xmath26 are ( by chance ) identical , the results are directly comparable . ) therefore , we observe that , in the case of the fits using the @xmath63-matrix parameterisations , the difference of the two @xmath15 values ( which is about @xmath99 ) reflects , almost entirely , the difference of the @xmath15 values in the separate fits to the tdb@xmath24 and tdb@xmath26 ( which is equal to @xmath100 , the smaller @xmath15 value for the fit to the tdb@xmath26 ) .",
    "the increase of the @xmath15 values in the fits to the tdb@xmath27 or to the tdb@xmath28 using the eth model ( over the result of the fits to the same data using the @xmath63-matrix parameterisations ) is due to the imposition of theoretical constraints ( e.g. , of the crossing and isospin symmetry ) ; as earlier mentioned , the fits to the data using the @xmath63-matrix parameterisations are devoid of theoretical constraints , other than the expected low - energy behaviour of the @xmath63-matrix elements .",
    "all else being equal , one would expect that the difference in the @xmath15 values between the model fit to the data and the fit using the @xmath63-matrix parameterisations would ( more or less ) be the same for the two truncated databases , i.e. , for the tdb@xmath27 and tdb@xmath28 ; however , this is far from being true .",
    "the value of @xmath101 for the difference @xmath15(tdb@xmath27)@xmath102(tdb@xmath28 ) in the fits using the @xmath63-matrix parameterisations turns into @xmath103 with the use of the eth model .",

    "evidently , the substitution of the tdb@xmath24 with tdb@xmath26 leads to a noticeable deterioration of the overall description of the experimental data in the model fits .",
    "this deterioration is a first indication of a general difficulty in the description of the tdb@xmath28 in terms of _ one _ set of parameter values of the eth model .",
    "this fact can be explained if the theoretical basis upon which the data analysis rests ( presumably , the isospin invariance in the hadronic part of the @xmath3 interaction ) is somewhat disturbed .",

    "these results establish a rather problematic situation ( from the point of view of the analysis of the measurements with the eth model ) when forcing the data of these two reactions into a common optimisation scheme ; the different values of the two intercepts demonstrate the overall tendency in the optimisation , with the generation of _ overestimated _ fitted dcs values for the @xmath2 reaction and _ underestimated _ ones for the cx reaction .",
    "it appears that the optimisation of the description of the input data is achieved at the expense of creating a bias in the reproduction of the two subsets ( reactions ) comprising the set of the input measurements .",

    "we now summarise the main results obtained so far .    *",
    "three of the values of the parameters of the @xmath63-matrix parameterisations ( i.e. , @xmath69 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 ) , extracted in the analysis of the tdb@xmath28 , differ significantly from those obtained in the analysis of the tdb@xmath27 . *",

    "the results of table [ tab : chisquaresndf ] , for the three values of @xmath12 which have been used in ref .",
    "@xcite , are consistent . *",
    "a significant difference has been seen in the @xmath38-wave phase shift @xmath5 ; smaller differences are observed in two @xmath39-wave phase shifts , i.e. , in @xmath125 and in @xmath126 . *",
    "the reproduction of the absolute normalisation of the cx data sets on the basis of the zuas12 prediction is poor below @xmath7 mev .",
    "the differences observed amount to a @xmath6 effect in the cx scattering amplitude .",
    "these differences between the zuas12 and zuas12a solutions and the predictions obtained on their basis are significant .",
    "we will now attempt to identify possible causes of the observed discrepancies .    in view of the results obtained so far , there are three assumptions , of which at most two can be simultaneously valid .    *",
    "the absolute normalisation of the bulk of the low - energy @xmath3 experimental data is reliable . * the residual contributions in the em corrections , applied to the experimental data in order to extract the hadronic part of the @xmath3 amplitude , are negligible . * the isospin invariance in the hadronic part of the @xmath3 interaction holds .",
    "we will next elaborate on each of the three possibilities arising from the nonfulfillment of the aforementioned presumptions .",
    "the first explanation for the observed differences involves a trivial effect , namely the systematic incorrectness of the absolute normalisation in the low - energy @xmath3 data .",
    "arguments have been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , to substantiate the claim that some of the reported uncertainties in the @xmath3 experimentation have been underestimated ; concerning this last issue , the data analysis dictates that the two elastic - scattering reactions are more affected than the cx .",
    "our first point concerns the statistical uncertainties of the data points . when visually inspecting the low - energy @xmath3 data , one is frequently unable to comprehend",
    "how it is possible for successive measurements ( i.e. , at neighbouring values of the cm scattering angle ) to be so different .",
    "there are many occasions in the databases where the statistical uncertainties of the data points seem questionable .",
    "our second point concerns the systematic effects .",
    "it is not understood how the absolute normalisation of some experiments , e.g. , of the fitzgerald86 data sets at the three lowest energies , may be wrong ( according to the bulk of the tdb@xmath26 ) by an average of about @xmath191 ( and of a fourth data set by @xmath192 ) , at a time when the reported normalisation uncertainty in the experiment was @xmath193 .",
    "such an effect may only be caused by any of three reasons ( or their combination ) : a ) the determination of the absolute normalisation in the experiment had been erroneous , b ) the energy of the incoming beam had not been what the experimenters expected , or c ) the normalisation uncertainty in the experiment had been grossly underestimated .",
    "our third point concerns the small values of the normalisation uncertainty reported in many low - energy @xmath3 experiments ; for instance , the reported normalisation uncertainties in @xmath194 out of the @xmath195 data sets in the initial db@xmath27 are below @xmath51 .",
    "one could possibly try to modify the small values of the normalisation uncertainty ( perhaps , by setting a lower limit at @xmath51 ) , yet such an approach seems arbitrary .",
    "consequently , one is left with no other option than to rely on an approach which places importance on the absolute normalisation of the bulk of the experimental data and to apply a reasonable procedure for the elimination of the outliers ; this is the approach which we set up in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there is one disturbing discrepancy in the entire analysis of the tdb@xmath27 which can not be easily put aside , namely , the disagreement between the @xmath123 value obtained as an extrapolation from the experimental data ( above the @xmath3 threshold ) and the one extracted directly at the @xmath3 threshold from the strong shift of the @xmath43 level in pionic hydrogen . assuming the correctness of both the absolute normalisation of the bulk of the elastic - scattering databases and of the raw measurement of @xmath196 @xcite",
    ", the two extracted values should be compatible , if a consistent set of em corrections ( i.e. , corrections which have been obtained within the same framework and which are also complete in the sense of containing the contributions from all relevant physical effects ) have been applied to the raw data . in case of important residual effects in the em corrections",
    "( see next section ) , the question surfaces as to the energy dependence of these contributions .",
    "although it is not clear how these contributions can modify so drastically the overall picture and especially the results of table [ tab : chisquaresndf ] ( any residual em contributions are expected to affect equally the description of the experimental data on the basis of the @xmath63-matrix parameterisations and of the eth model ) , the completeness of the em corrections in the @xmath3 system at low energies is an important issue which must be properly defined and treated . in refs .",
    "@xcite , some details are given on the effects which the stage - ii em corrections contain ; these effects are mostly related to the use of the physical instead of the ( unknown ) hadronic masses for the proton , the neutron , and the charged and neutral pion in the determination of the em corrections @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it may be argued that the appropriate inclusion of these effects should lead to the optimal description of the input data . if this is the case , then the iterative procedure which had been set forth in the determination of the em corrections in refs .",
    "@xcite must have captured some of these effects .",
    "unable , however , to either validate this statement or refute it , we can only encourage the theoretical re - assessment of the role of the em effects in the low - energy @xmath3 interaction .",
    "this is the last of the options which may be put forth in an attempt to explain the observed discrepancies and , admittedly , the most interesting one in physics terms .",
    "this possibility may account for the results of table [ tab : chisquaresndf ] .",
    "there has been a great amount of discussion regarding the acceptance of the conclusions of refs .",
    "one is tempted , however , to pose the question : ` why should the isospin invariance in the @xmath3 system be obeyed in the first place ? ' after all , the hadronic masses of the @xmath197 and @xmath55 quarks are different ; similarly , the masses of the nucleons differ ( beyond trivial em effects ) , and so do those of the @xmath198 s .",
    "it appears , therefore , that the appropriate question to ask is not whether the isospin invariance is violated , but at which amount it is . within the framework of the heavy - baryon chiral - perturbation theory ,",
    "the group of meiner have repeatedly treated isospin - breaking effects in the @xmath3 system at low energies and concluded that the discrepancy should be at most at the percent level ( e.g. , see ref .",
    "@xcite and the references cited therein ) .",
    "two mechanisms had been proposed in the past , to account for the violation of the isospin invariance in the hadronic part of the @xmath3 interaction at the level of feynman graphs : the first mechanism affects the elastic scattering ( @xmath199 mixing @xcite-@xcite ) , the second the cx reaction ( @xmath200 mixing @xcite ) . as both the @xmath201 and the @xmath202 states are singlets , the coupling of the former to the @xmath203 and of the latter to the @xmath37 explicitly violate the isospin invariance . given that , in the case of the elastic scattering , only one graph ( i.e. , the @xmath204-channel @xmath205-exchange graph ) is affected , whereas in the case of the cx reaction all graphs are influenced ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : isospinbreakingetapi0 ] ) , one would be prone to conclude that the isospin - breaking effects are more important in the latter case ; however , ref .",
    "@xcite concluded with the statement that `  the isospin violation from @xmath200 mixing can be safely ignored in @xmath3 partial - wave analyses . ' in fact , the possibility of large isospin - breaking effects in specific kinematical regions is not refuted in ref .",
    "@xcite ; for instance , emphasis in that paper was placed on the effects induced in the amplitude of one higher baryon resonance , which were expected to be around the @xmath206 level .",
    "unfortunately , there is no indication that the kinematical region around the @xmath3 threshold received equal attention in ref .",
    "of course , this is not very surprising given the scarcity of the low - energy @xmath3 measurements around the time ref .",
    "@xcite appeared ; in fact , below @xmath207 mev , the only cx dcs measurements , which were available at that time , were the @xmath208 data points of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we noticed that the coupling constant @xmath209 is significantly affected when substituting the tdb@xmath24 with the tdb@xmath26 .",
    "of course , if the isospin invariance is violated , there is not _",
    "one _ coupling constant @xmath209 ; one must distinguish between @xmath210 , @xmath211 , and @xmath212 . in this case , the fits to the elastic - scattering data essentially determine @xmath212 , whereas those involving the cx reaction also contain contributions from @xmath210 and @xmath211 . as a result , the value of the coupling constant @xmath209 extracted from the common fits to the tdb@xmath28 represents a weighted average of these three quantities .",
    "the differences observed imply that at least one of the two @xmath213 coupling constants differs from @xmath212 .",
    "the isospin - breaking effects on @xmath209 have been studied theoretically and generally found to be small ; for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite evaluated these effects using qcd sum rules and reported that @xmath212 should be equal to the average of the two @xmath213 values and that the splitting should be expected between @xmath214 and @xmath215 .",
    "the difference between the two @xmath209 values of table [ tab : modelparameters ] is larger , around the @xmath216 level .",
    "this study concludes the analysis of the presently - available pion - nucleon ( @xmath3 ) data below pion laboratory kinetic energy of @xmath1 mev . the separate analysis of the data for the two elastic - scattering and for the charge - exchange ( cx ) reactions was enabled via suitable parameterisations of the @xmath38- and @xmath39-wave @xmath63-matrix elements at low energies .",
    "common fits to the data were performed using either these @xmath63-matrix parameterisations or the eth model of ref .",

    "the analysis with the @xmath63-matrix parameterisations led to the identification of the outliers in the databases and tested the self - consistency of the input prior to its submission to the fits using the eth model .",
    "the optimal values of the model parameters , as well as their correlation matrix , were obtained from the ensuing fits and were used as the basis for generating monte - carlo predictions for the em - modified hadronic phase shifts , for the low - energy @xmath3 constants , as well as for the standard observables ( i.e. , for the differential cross section ( dcs ) , analysing power ( ap ) , partial - total cross section ( ptcs ) , and total cross section ( tcs ) ) for any of the three reactions , at any value of the relevant kinematical variables ( i.e. , energy and scattering angle for the dcs and ap , energy and laboratory - angle cut for the ptcs , and energy for the tcs ) .    given that the electromagnetic ( em ) corrections ( which are applied to the hadronic phase shifts in order to extract the @xmath3 partial - wave amplitudes , which , in turn , lead to the observables ) of refs .  @xcite have been obtained by using the physical , instead of the ( unknown ) hadronic , masses for the proton , the neutron , and the charged and neutral pion , we have assumed the cautious attitude of considering the various physical quantities ( i.e. , the model parameters , the low - energy @xmath3 constants , the hadronic phase shifts , etc . )",
    "not purely hadronic , but em - modified hadronic . at the present time",
    ", one can not assess the importance of the residual em effects ( i.e. , of the stage - ii em corrections ) .",

    "large effects were found both in two of the model parameters , as well as in the em - modified hadronic phase shifts @xmath5 ; significantly smaller differences have been found in two @xmath39-wave phase shifts .    assuming the correctness of the absolute normalisation of the bulk of the low - energy @xmath3 databases , as well as the negligibility of the residual contributions in the em corrections ( i.e. , of the stage - ii effects ) , these discrepancies can only be attributed to the violation of the isospin invariance in the hadronic part of the @xmath3 interaction at low energies .",
    "the effect observed is at the level of @xmath6 in the scattering amplitude below @xmath7 mev .",

    "fig : isospinbreakingetapi0 ] are the dominant ones and if the effects observed in the present study are indeed due to the violation of the isospin invariance , then the description of the experimental data ( especially when the cx reaction is included in the fits ) should improve significantly .",
    "c ) the extrapolation of the amplitudes of the eth model in the unphysical region , to the cheng - dashen point ( in order to obtain reliable values of the @xmath3 @xmath218-term ) , should be seriously investigated .",
    "finally , it would be interesting to investigate the violation of the isospin invariance using only the results from pionic hydrogen and deuterium ( i.e. , the data acquired directly at the @xmath3 threshold ) by extracting and comparing the scattering lengths and their standard combinations , in a way similar to the one introduced in ref .",
    "the results of the original experiments ( which were performed in the 1990s ) are known , as are those for pionic deuterium of the successor experiment ; the results of this experiment for pionic hydrogen are still marked as preliminary @xcite .",
