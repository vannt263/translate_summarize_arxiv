    "recently , there has been considerable attention given to properties of hadrons containing a single heavy quark with mass , @xmath0 , much larger than the typical scale of strong interactions , @xmath1 .",

    "these  heavy hadrons \" are frequently described within the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite , which represents a @xmath2 expansion of the heavy quark content of qcd .",
    "the heavy quark effective lagrangian is set up from the heavy quark transformation @xmath3 which disentangles the large @xmath4 and small @xmath5 components of the heavy quark spinor , @xmath6 . in eq ( [ hqt ] )",
    ", @xmath7 refers to the velocity of the heavy quark spinor which , _",
    "e.g. _  in its rest frame takes the form , @xmath8 .",
    "the dirac operator for the large component is expanded as @xmath9 .",
    "since the leading order term commutes with the quark spin operator , heavy mesons differing only by their spins , as _ e.g. _ pseudoscalar and vector mesons , are degenerate in the heavy quark limit , @xmath10 .",
    "the empirical spectrum of heavy mesons @xcite , @xmath11 and @xmath12 represents the most convincing evidence of the heavy quark symmetry .",
    "this degeneracy is in contrast to the spectrum of mesons containing only light quarks . here",
    "the pseudoscalars are much lighter than the vector mesons .",
    "this is understood by interpreting the light pseudoscalar mesons as the would ",
    "be goldstone bosons of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the incorporation of the heavy quark symmetry into effective meson theories is accomplished by introducing the heavy meson field , @xmath13 , in the heavy quark rest frame @xcite . here ,",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the light and heavy quark spins respectively , while @xmath16 refers to the isospin of the light quark .",
    "this field contains pseudoscalar @xmath17 and vector @xmath18 mesons on equal footing @xcite , @xmath19 according to the heavy quark symmetry the heavy spin index ( @xmath15 ) decouples completely in effective theories .",
    "the interactions of @xmath20 with the light mesons proceeds via the light quark indices @xmath21 and is governed by chiral symmetry .",
    "such effective models have been employed to not only study the properties of heavy mesons , ( spectrum , form factors , weak decays ) @xcite but also the spectrum of heavy baryons @xcite . in this context the soliton picture for baryons is commonly adopted . within this approach",
    "the baryon number is carried by a solitonic configuration of the light meson fields .",
    "heavy baryons emerge when a heavy meson is bound in the background of this soliton .",
    "this picture relies on the bound state approach to strange baryons initiated by callan and klebanov @xcite .",
    "the main difference here is that for the heavy meson both the pseudoscalar and vector meson degrees of freedom have to be taken into account as a consequence of the above mentioned degeneracy .",
    "a continuous transition from the hyperons to the heavy baryons containing @xmath22 or @xmath23quarks instead of an @xmath24quark suggests a p  wave configuration for the bound meson .    in the heavy quark limit the heavy meson wave  function , @xmath25 ,",
    "is confined to the center @xmath26 of the soliton . for a quantitative determination of this effect",
    "it is necessary to take into account the interaction amongst the heavy quark degrees of freedom before performing the transformation ( [ hqt ] ) @xcite .",
    "however , to leading order in the @xmath2 expansion it is consistent to investigate the interaction of a strongly peaked heavy meson wave  function and the light quark degrees of freedom while henceforth discarding that part of the action which only describes heavy quark degrees of freedom .",
    "up to @xmath27 corrections the binding energy of the heavy baryon is thus determined by the properties of the soliton at @xmath28 @xcite . in that case",
    "the bound state equation reduces to an eigenvalue problem for the coefficients of the operators in the general p  wave _ ansatz _ for @xmath25 .    here",
    "we study such bound systems within the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite extended to incorporate heavy quark symmetry @xcite .",
    "in contrast to skyrme type models the soliton in the njl model contains components of non - vanishing grand spin .",
    "the grand spin is the vector sum of total angular momentum and isospin , @xmath29 .",
    "the appearance of additional modes is due to the quark sub - structure of the soliton and leads to a novel coupling scheme between the heavy meson and the soliton as will become clear in the course of this paper .",
    "in particular , the largest binding energy is obtained for a heavy meson configuration which completely decouples from the grand spin zero channel of the light quarks .    in section  2",
    "we review the extension of the njl model to include heavy quarks . in section",
    "3 the bound state wave  function of the heavy meson in the background of the soliton in the njl model is constructed .",
    "the numerical results are presented in section  4 and concluding remarks are contained in section  5 .",
    "some technical details are relegated to an appendix .",
    "in njl - type quark models the interaction lagrangian is given by a four quark contact term .",
    "the heavy quark symmetry is incorporated by only taking into account the large component @xmath30 which is defined in eq .",

    "is introduced such that the lagrangian is bilinear in the quark fields , @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the dirac spinor of the light quarks in the chirally rotated representation @xmath35 @xcite . denoting by @xmath36 the root of the chiral field , @xmath37 in unitary gauge , we have @xmath38 .",

    "its explicit form may _ e.g. _ be found in ref .",
    "finally , @xmath49 refers to the dirac operator for the light quarks , @xmath50 and describes the interaction between these quarks and soliton constructed from the light mesons which in turn are quark composites .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath49 will be presented in section  3 .    in eq .",
    "( [ act ] ) we have already indicated the need for regularization . for the ongoing discussion we will employ schwinger s proper - time regularization @xcite . in the njl model this implies a continuation to euclidean space @xmath51 .",

    "subsequently , its real part is replaced by a parameter integral @xmath54 with the high momentum contribution chopped off .",
    "the imaginary part , @xmath55 is finite and remains unchanged . after computing the functional trace",
    "the action is continued back to minkowski space . to adjust the model parameters we demand the physical pion mass and decay constant , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively",
    ". then all but one parameter of the light quark sector are determined @xcite . for transparency this",
    "is commonly chosen to be the constituent quark mass , @xmath47 .",
    "subsequently , the heavy quark coupling constant , @xmath58 , is fitted to the @xmath59-meson decay constant @xmath60 as estimated from lattice qcd @xcite and qcd sum rules @xcite . since the present treatment closely follows the computation of ref .",
    "@xcite we dispense with further details although one remark is in order .",
    "as mentioned above , the light ( axial ) vector mesons are omitted in the present study . as a consequence of the missing @xmath61 mixing the relation between @xmath62 and @xmath63",
    "is modified whence reducing the numerical value of @xmath63 .",
    "this also effects the prediction for @xmath58 .",
    "we display the resulting values in table  [ tab_mes ] . for the system without the light ( axial ) vector mesons",
    "we have re - evaluated the binding energy , @xmath64 , of the heavy meson by determining the root , @xmath65 of the bethe - salpeter equation for the heavy meson field @xmath32 . for simplicity",
    "we expand this bethe - salpeter equation in powers of @xmath66 , with @xmath67 being the residual four - momentum of @xmath32 .",
    "the coefficients in this expansion depend on the proper - time cut - off , @xmath63 .",
    "it turns out that the expansion in @xmath66 converges less rapidly than in the model with light ( axial ) vector mesons .",
    "an expansion up to at least cubic order proved necessary to gain reliable results . in table [ tab_mes ] we present the predicted root , @xmath65 , and the binding energy , @xmath68 .",
    "these results were obtained from an expansion up to fifth order in @xmath66 .",
    "the analytic form of this expansion is provide in the appendix _ cf .",
    "_ eqs ( [ app2 ] ) and ( [ app3 ] ) .",
    "apparently the binding energy increases with the constituent quark mass .",
    "it should be stressed that these results correspond to the leading order of the @xmath2 expansion .",
    "( [ mtx ] ) shows that only the residual momentum , @xmath69 , is affected by the regularization as a consequence of the heavy quark transformation ( [ hqt ] ) .",
    "this is physically meaningful and crucial for a consistent interpretation of the model .",
    "indeed , the residual momentum of the heavy quark in a hadron containing a single heavy quark arises entirely from its interaction with the light degrees of freedom ( in this case light quarks ) and is thus cut off at the same scale @xmath63 . note that the cut  off",
    "@xmath63 is significantly smaller than the c or b quark masses ( _ cf .",
    "_ table [ tab_mes ] ) .",
    "before describing heavy baryons as bound systems it is appropriate to briefly explain the emergence of the soliton .",

    "furthermore , @xmath76 denotes the occupation number of the valence quark level .",
    "this level is defined to be the one with the smallest module @xmath77 .",
    "its occupation number is adjusted to describe a configuration possessing unit baryon number , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath78 .",
    "finally the chiral angle , @xmath79 is self  consistently determined by minimizing @xmath80 @xcite .    in order to compute the binding energy of the heavy meson in the soliton background the bosonized action ( [ act ] )",
    "is first expanded up to the quadratic order in the meson field , @xmath81 @xmath82 where the arguments @xmath83 of the heavy fields have been omitted . in analogy to the static energy functional ( [ eng ] ) this part of the action is composed of a purely mesonic piece as well as valence and vacuum contributions .",
    "the regularization function , @xmath84 is obtained as an expansion in the frequency @xmath85 @xmath86 this expansion is equivalent to the one in terms of @xmath66 for the meson sector . for completeness",
    "we list @xmath84 up to fifth in the appendix , _ cf . _ eq ( [ app5 ] ) .",
    "it is not surprising that this result for @xmath87 can equivalently be obtained from the expression found for the fluctuations of kaon fields in the background of the njl model soliton @xcite once the eigenenergies for the strange quark levels are set to zero .",
    "we note that in the unregularized formulation only the negative energy states contribute to the vacuum part of @xmath87 because @xmath88 in the many body interpretation of the functional integral , @xmath89 , one would phrase this result such that in the limit @xmath90 only the occupied quark orbits couple to the heavy meson . the unregularized expression ( [ runreg ] )",
    "may independently be derived when considering @xmath91 in minkowski space .",
    "here @xmath92 denotes the non  relativistic propagator in the heavy quark rest frame .",
    "however , the regularization is unavoidable since @xmath93 diverges logarithmically .",
    "nevertheless , the limit ( [ runreg ] ) serves as an independent check on our computations . from the expression ( [ runreg ] ) it also becomes apparent that the total action ( [ actexp ] ) is continuous as the energy eigenvalue associated with the valence quark orbit changes its sign .",
    "next we study the coupling of a grand spin @xmath94 , p  wave heavy meson to the soliton .",
    "such a configuration can be expressed in terms of three radial functions @xcite @xmath95 here @xmath96 denotes a ( constant ) isospinor .",
    "one might have expected the appearance of three different isospinors .",
    "however , such an _ ansatz _ is waived because it is not an eigenstate of the grand spin projection operator .",
    "skyrme model studies @xcite also indicate that the light grand spin , which is defined as the grand spin of the operator multiplying @xmath97 , has to vanish for the meson configuration with the largest binding energy . in the heavy quark limit",
    "the binding energy of this heavy meson is determined by the potential it experiences at the center of the soliton , @xmath98 . in order to extract this potential",
    "it is convenient ( and consistent ) to adopt radial functions in eq ( [ hpwave ] ) which are non  vanishing only at @xmath98 .",
    "consequently , the heavy meson field only couples to quark levels , which have non  vanishing radial functions at @xmath98 .",
    "as can be seen from the decomposition ( [ hmfield ] ) and the coupling scheme exhibited in the lagrangian ( [ lhl ] ) , these non  vanishing radial functions must occur in the lower components of the light quark fields . at first sight",
    "this appears to be surprising because the lower component of the valence quark eigenfunction happens to vanish at @xmath98 .",
    "however , one has to be aware of the fact that the heavy meson couples to the light quark states via the chiral rotation , which is off  diagonal at the origin in the presence of the soliton since @xmath99 , @xmath100 allowing the valence quark to couple to the heavy meson .",
    "in addition to the channel with grand spin zero , which includes the valence quark orbit , only the channel carrying grand spin one contains states , which do not vanish at @xmath98 .    carrying out the angular integrals as well as the flavor and dirac traces",
    "finally yields the action as a function of the values which the meson wave  functions in eq ( [ hpwave ] ) assume at @xmath98 . denoting these by @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively , we find @xmath103 the inverse propagator is a @xmath104 matrix @xmath105 denoting by @xmath106 the radial parts of the upper components of the light quark wave  functions , which are eigenstates of @xmath15 , the spectral functions are expressed as , carry the dimension @xmath107 . ] @xmath108 the sums refer to distinct quark grand spin ( @xmath109 ) channels .",
    "the equation of motion for the heavy meson reduces to a homogeneous matrix equation for @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "its solution requires adjusting @xmath85 to @xmath112 such that @xmath113 possesses vanishing eigenvalues .",
    "it is easy to show that there exist two distinct solutions to this problem @xmath114 the vectors of set ( 2 ) obviously span a two dimensional vector space causing the associated eigenstates to be degenerate .",
    "the set ( 1 ) decouples from the @xmath115 states while the set ( 2 ) is annihilated by the @xmath116 states .",
    "in particular , the set ( 1 ) corresponds to the bound state wave  function found in the heavy quark limit of properly extended skyrme type models @xcite @xmath117 the interpretation of this situation is obvious : if the background soliton field contains only @xmath116 states , as it is the case in skyrme type models , the only solution will be given by the set ( 1 ) .",
    "however , if also @xmath115 states are present an alternative solution will exist .",
    "the soliton dynamics , from which the spectral functions @xmath118 and @xmath119 are computed , then determines which of these two modes , ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) , leads to a larger binding and therefore has to be interpreted as the lightest baryon containing a heavy quark .",
    "in analogy with the meson sector we have expanded the regularization function , @xmath120 , ( [ rlexp ] ) up to fifth order in the frequency @xmath85 . in figure 1 the resultant frequency dependence of the spectral functions ( [ seta ] ) and ( [ setb ] )",
    "is shown for the special case @xmath121 . as a result of the heavy quark transformation ( [ hqt ] ) the threshold for the ( unphysical ) decay of the heavy meson into a quark ",
    "antiquark pair is given by the energy of the lowest accessible light quark state .",
    "therefore a singularity appears at @xmath122 for the mode coupling to the @xmath116 channel , while the radius of convergence is much larger in the case of the @xmath115 one channel .",
    "the latter mode apparently leads to a smaller eigenfrequency , @xmath112 .",
    "the total energy of the system consisting of the soliton and the bound meson is given by @xmath123 .",
    "as the total energy of the heavy meson in the trivial background is @xmath124 the binding energy of the heavy baryon becomes @xmath125 .",
    "this binding energy is measured with regard to a decay into a soliton and a heavy meson . when increasing the heavy quark coupling constant , @xmath58 , the curves shown in figure 1 get shifted downwards by a constant amount .",
    "hence the roots decrease and the binding energies of the baryon states containing a heavy quark become larger when the coupling gains strength . obviously , a heavy baryon constructed from an eigenmode of type ( 2 ) is more strongly bound than a type ( 1 ) heavy meson . in table",
    "[ tab_bar ] the predicted roots , @xmath112 , as well as the associated binding energies , @xmath126 , of the heavy baryon are presented . for the modes of type ( 1 ) the eigenfrequency acquires a maximum for @xmath127 . since @xmath65 increases with the constituent quark mass , @xmath47 , the binding energy for the associated heavy baryon exhibits almost no variation for @xmath128 .",
    "when @xmath47 is further increased the eigenfrequency decreases leading to a larger binding energy .",
    "this behavior of @xmath112 is due to the decrease of @xmath129 when @xmath47 grows . on the contrary",
    ", the eigenfrequency corresponding to the eigenvectors of type ( 2 ) appears to be a quickly , monotonously decreasing function of @xmath47 .",
    "this causes the binding energy of the corresponding heavy baryon to significantly increase with @xmath47 . since studies in the light quark sector of the njl model favor @xmath130 @xcite the results displayed in table [ tab_bar ] suggest the interpretation that the njl model predicts the baryon with one heavy quark to have a binding energy of about @xmath131 in leading order of the @xmath132 expansion .",
    "a less strongly bound state is obtained possessing about half of that binding energy . as discussed above the latter state",
    "corresponds to the one which is identified as the most strongly bound baryon in skyrme type models . in this context it has to be remarked that a state associated with the mode ( 2 ) does not appear in skyrme type models because in those models the background soliton is a pure @xmath116 configuration . if the njl model soliton had contained no @xmath115 components the most strongly bound baryon would have been of the same structure as in purely mesonic soliton models .    as in the bound state approach @xcite",
    "heavy baryon states with good spin and isospin are generated by canonically quantizing the collective isospin rotation , @xmath133 , of the meson fields .",
    "this adds a term of the form @xmath134 to the action .",
    "the index @xmath135 refers to the distinct sets in eqs ( [ seta],[setb ] ) .",
    "the time derivative of the collective rotation defines the angular velocity @xmath136 via @xmath137 . empolying ( iso)rotational invariance these coefficients",
    "can hence be computed from the matrix elements @xmath138 .",
    "as argued above @xmath32 only couples to quark states with @xmath139 .",
    "the bound state of set ( 1 ) has non  vanishing matrix elements only for quark levels with @xmath116 . in that case",
    "the matrix element of @xmath140 vanishes , hence @xmath141 , in agreement with the skyrme model results @xcite . for the set ( 2 )",
    "there is indeed a coupling when both quark levels ( @xmath142 and @xmath143 ) are from the @xmath144 channel .",
    "we find @xmath145/[(\\zeta+2)^2 + 2]$ ] , where the positive definite denominator is due to the normalization associated to the metric induced by the coefficient matrix of @xmath119 in eq ( [ a2abc2 ] ) .",
    "although the collective rotation removes the degeneracy in @xmath146 we will argue that @xmath147 is negligibly small without going into the details of the calculation .",
    "for quark states ( @xmath142 and @xmath143 ) from the @xmath144 channel the above mentioned matrix elements are similar to those entering the evaluation of the moment of inertia @xmath148 @xcite . as the collective quantization gives rise to a factor @xmath149 ,",
    "@xmath147 can be estimated by the contribution of the @xmath144 channel to the total moment of inertia .",
    "this contribution is very small because @xmath148 is dominated by the valence quark level , which resides in the @xmath150 channel , _",
    "e.g. _ for @xmath121 we find a contribution of only 2% .",
    "hence we conclude that there is ( almost ) no hyperfine splitting in the heavy quark limit .",
    "for a finite heavy quark mass this conclusion should change because @xmath32 will couple to channels with @xmath151 as well .",
    "we have analyzed fluctuations of mesons with a heavy quark in the background of the njl model chiral soliton in the leading order of the heavy quark mass expansion .",
    "we have succeeded in showing that at this order the associated bethe ",
    "salpeter equation possesses the bound state solution known from skyrme model studies .",
    "we have furthermore seen that this bethe  salpeter equation contains an additional solution which arises from the coupling of the heavy meson field to vacuum quark states . also , the novel bound state appears in degenerate pairs .",
    "the actual computation reveals that in the njl model the novel states are more strongly bound than those configurations known from the skyrme model .",
    "although this certainly represents an interesting feature in its own , future studies are required to find out whether or not this novel state is an artifact of applying the well  established @xmath132 expansion to the njl model . in comparison",
    "a few aspects of the skyrme model calculation for finite @xmath0 @xcite are worthwhile to be mentioned .",
    "first , the restriction to the leading order of the @xmath132 expansion has been found to be a somewhat crude approximation to the realistic cases causing states , which are predicted to be degenerate at leading order , to acquire distinct binding energies when corrections of subleading order are taken into account .",
    "we assume that a similar mechanism will remove the degeneracy of the novel states in the njl model .",
    "second , table ( 1 ) of ref @xcite shows that the transition from infinite to realistic values of @xmath0 is indeed continuous .",
    "in particular the order of bound states remains unchanged .",
    "hence one is inclined to conjecture that the novel states persist for finite @xmath0 .",
    "third , not all bound states , which are predicted within the large @xmath0 limit are permitted for finite @xmath0 because the limits @xmath152 and @xmath153 do not necessarily commute .",
    "this respresents the only mechanism which would prohibit the existence of the novel states in the case of finite @xmath0 .",
    "these issues certainly raise interest for generalizing the njl model studies to finite @xmath0 .",
    "such studies are considerably more involved because it is crucial to first perform the heavy quark transformation and to subsequently regularize the functional trace to have a consistent interpretation of the model .    in practice",
    "the binding energies of heavy baryons are measured with respect to the decay into a nucleon and the lightest meson containing the corresponding heavy quark .",
    "the experimentally observed binding energies are @xmath154 and @xmath155 for the @xmath156 and @xmath157 , respectively @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that these baryons are degenerate in the heavy quark limit . in reasonable agreement with these data",
    "our numerical analysis yields a binding energy of about @xmath131 for the most strongly bound heavy baryon when the only free parameter of the model is adjusted to reproduce the properties of the light baryons .",
    "the less strongly bound heavy baryon with a predicted binding energy around @xmath158 may eventually be associated with @xmath159 .",
    "this baryon is bound by about ( @xmath160 ) against the decay into a nucleon and a @xmath161meson .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the main purpose of the present paper was to discuss the novel coupling scheme between the heavy meson and the soliton rather than to achieve a precise agreement with the experimentally observed binding energies .",

    "<S> therefore the bound state equation reduces to an eigenvalue problem for the coefficients of the operators contained in the most general p - wave _ ansatz _ for the heavy meson . within the njl model a novel feature arises from the coupling of the heavy meson to the various light quark states . in this respect conceptual differences to skyrme model calculations are discovered : the strongest bound state is given by a heavy meson configuration which is completely decoupled from the grand spin zero channel of the light quarks . </S>"
