    "complex networks are an essential part of modern society . many social  @xcite , biological  @xcite , transportation  @xcite and communication  @xcite systems can be cast into the form of complex networks , a set of nodes joined together by links indicating interactions .",
    "the investigation of complex networks was initiated by erds and rnyi  @xcite in 1950s .",
    "they introduced a kind of simplest and most straightforward complex networks , described as random graphs . in a random graph ,",
    "@xmath7 nodes are connected randomly with the probability @xmath8 .",
    "this model has guided our thinking about complex networks for decades since its introduction . in 1999",
    "barabsi and albert  @xcite began to put the emphasis on the network dynamics and constructed networks with the algorithm of _ growth _ and _ preferential attachment_. according to the ba model , the network grows over time by the addition of new nodes and links .",
    "a node newly added to the network randomly selects @xmath9 other nodes to establish new links , with a selection probability that increases with the number of links of the selected node .",
    "one of the most relevant is given by the scale - free nature of the degree distribution @xmath10 , defined as the probability that a randomly chosen node has degree @xmath11 ( i.e. , it is connected to other @xmath11 nodes ) . in mathematical terms",
    ", the scale - free property translates into a power - law function of the form @xmath12 .",
    "recently the security of complex networks to the random failures or intentional attacks has attracted a great deal of attention  @xcite .",
    "the random failure is simulated as the deletion of network nodes or links chosen at random , while intentional attack as the targeted removal of a specific class of nodes or links .",
    "the work by albert _",
    "@xcite demonstrated that scale - free networks , at variance of random graphs , are robust against random failures of nodes but vulnerable to intentional attacks .",
    "the analytical approach  @xcite has also been developed for investigating the error and attack tolerance .    however , despite the fine work of studies on network tolerance , little effort has been made on the repair of the attacked networks . in this paper",
    ", we propose a simple model and study the evolution of complex networks under continuous attacks and repairs .",
    "this effect can be pictured for the organism : the organism has to experience various dna damages and corresponding repairs during its growth .",
    "the effect can be also exemplified by the internet : the development of internet always follows the contest of virus attacks and protections .",
    "our model is aiming at investigating the stability appearing in the evolution of complex systems frequently attacked by internal or environmental agents .",
    "the model shows that complex networks will become more stable in the evolution and eventually reach the stationary states .",
    "we also discuss the topological changes of complex networks before and after the evolution",
    ". it will be useful for understanding the dynamics of complex systems .",
    "we start by constructing a network according to the erds - rnyi random graph ( rg ) model or barabsi - albert scale - free ( sf ) model .",
    "the algorithms of rg and sf networks have been mentioned in the introduction .",
    "the dynamics of our model is defined in terms of the following two operations :    1 .",
    "_ attack _ : find a node with the maximum degree @xmath13 and remove all its links .",
    "( if several nodes happen to have the same highest degree of connection , we randomly choose one of them . ) 2 .",
    "_ repair _ : reconnect this node with the other nodes in the network with probability @xmath14 .",
    "then , the evolution comes into the next monte carlo time step .",
    "the random repair is considered because most of the time our operation to the system is more or less blinded due to incomplete information .",
    "in addition , the size of the system remains unchanged during the evolution since the way of simulated attacks is the deletion of links . in order to reduce the number of parameters in the model",
    ", we set the repair probability @xmath14 the same as the connection probability @xmath8 in rg networks .",
    "this set also implies that the information does not increase from initial construction to later repairing .",
    "we have performed extensive numerical simulations to study the evolution of rg and sf networks .",
    "it can be easily seen that the maximum degree @xmath13 has a tendency to decrease in the evolution . in fig . 1 , we give a snapshot of the maximum degree @xmath13 versus time step @xmath15 with @xmath16 10 000 nodes and repair probability @xmath17 for rg and sf networks .",
    "we find that the fluctuation of @xmath13 is very large for rg networks .",
    "for sf networks , @xmath13 decreases very steeply at first and then steadily with @xmath15 .",
    "the behavior of scale - free networks is rooted in their extremely inhomogeneity in which the removal of a few highly connected nodes dramatically reduces the connections of the networks .     versus time step @xmath15 with size @xmath16 10 000 and @xmath17 for ( a ) random graphs ; ( b ) scale - free networks.,width=302,height=226 ]    [ fig1 ]    from intuition , a node with less links to others",
    "will be attacked less frequently .",
    "thus a network with smaller maximum connection degree is more stable . to describe the stability of the network",
    ", we introduce a new quality , _ invulnerability _ @xmath0 .",
    "the definition of @xmath0 is analogous to that of the _ gap _ @xmath18 in the bak - sneppen evolution model  @xcite , which is used to simulate the evolution of species .",
    "considering an evolution of network with maximum degrees @xmath19 , @xmath20 , ... , @xmath21 , invulnerability @xmath0 at time @xmath15 is defined    @xmath22    i.e. , the inverse of the minimum of all the maximum degrees in the evolution before moment @xmath15",
    ". initial value of @xmath0 is equal to @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath0 reflects the attack tolerance of the network .",
    "when @xmath0 is small , the network is vulnerable to attack and behaves less stability .",
    "obviously from definition , @xmath0 is non - decreasing function of evolution , and some fluctuations in @xmath13 have been filtered out .     versus step @xmath24 with @xmath16 10 000 and @xmath17.,width=302 ]    [ fig2 ]    in fig .",
    "2 we plot the evolution @xmath0 versus @xmath24 of rg and sf networks under @xmath16 10 000 and @xmath17 .",
    "we observe that in both networks @xmath0 increases very quickly at small @xmath15 but slowly at large @xmath15 and finally reaches a stationary value @xmath1 when @xmath15 is large enough .",
    "the increase of @xmath0 indicates that the system is getting more and more stable in general by experiencing continuous attacks and repairs .",
    "this figure is similar to the envelope function of bak - sneppen evolution model . without interference from outside world",
    ", the network evolves to a stationary state , and the process takes place over a very long transient period .      in this section",
    "we will present the properties of stationary value @xmath25 in the stationary state for rg networks . in rg networks ,",
    "the average degree @xmath26 is determined by the connection probability @xmath8 and the size @xmath7 , @xmath27 . with @xmath28 fixed and @xmath29 , we find that @xmath30 stays unchanged at 0.2 with size @xmath7 ranging from 100 to 10 000 .",
    "this result is interesting , because it shows that the stationary value @xmath30 depends not on the network size @xmath7 , but the average degree @xmath26 .     versus @xmath26 with size @xmath7 ranging from 100 to 10 000.,width=226 ]    [ fig3 ]    to get the relationship between @xmath30 and @xmath31",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "3 @xmath30 as a function of @xmath26 in a log - log plot .",
    "we find that @xmath30 has a power - law dependence on the average degree @xmath26 ,    @xmath32    where the exponent @xmath33 is about 1.5 .",
    "3 illustrates that after the network has relaxed to the stationary state , the stability of the network will increase rapidly with the decrease of average degree @xmath26 .",
    "thus , when the @xmath26 is small , i.e. , less communications and interactions in the network , the system will be more stable .",
    "the properties of stationary value @xmath34 in the stationary state for sf networks will be illustrated in this section . in fig .",
    "4 , we plot @xmath35 as a function of repair probability @xmath3 in a semi - log coordinate with @xmath16 1000 ( circles ) ; 5000 ( squares ) and 10 000 ( triangles ) . we find that @xmath34 decreases with the increase of @xmath7 or @xmath3 . while large @xmath7 or @xmath3 means the large number of links in networks . in other words ,",
    "the stability of the system relies on the internal interactions within the system , that is , the stronger the interactions , the less stable the system . from fig .",
    "4 we can also observe that in this semi - log plot @xmath35 has an approximately linear decrease with @xmath3 under fixed @xmath7 , i.e. , an exponential relationship between @xmath34 and @xmath3 ,    @xmath36    where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are two fitting parameters related to the size @xmath7 .     versus repair probability @xmath3 with size",

    "[ comparison ] , we display the topological changes of rg and sf networks under @xmath16 10 000 and @xmath17 .",
    "we use the superscript @xmath39 and @xmath15 to distinguish the initial and stationary states .",

    "this result is rooted in the homogeneity of rg networks . since in rg networks",
    "all nodes have approximately the same number of links , majority of nodes in the network will be impacted by the attacks and , hence , the rapid decrease of @xmath4 .",
    "_ characteristic path length_. the characteristic path length @xmath41 is the average length of the shortest paths between any two nodes in the network .",
    "@xmath42 in the stationary state is a little larger than @xmath43 , which exhibits that it will take a little longer for the nodes in the network to communicate with each other after the evolution .",

    "@xmath47 for rg and sf networks are increased by @xmath48 and @xmath49 , compared with @xmath50 in the initial states .",

    "_ assortativity_. the assortativity @xmath6 in the range @xmath51 is another interesting feature of complex networks .",
    "a network is said to show assortative , @xmath52 , if the high - degree nodes in the network preferentially connect to other high - degree nodes .",
    "by contrast , a network is disassortative , @xmath53 , if the high - degree nodes tend to connect to other low - degree nodes .",
    "the values of @xmath54 and @xmath55 have shown that both rg and sf networks turn to strongly assortative networks in the stationary states from initial weakly assortative or even disassortative ones .",
    "_ degree distribution_. fig .",
    "4(a ) and 4(b ) display the degree distributions @xmath10 of rg and sf networks in the initial and stationary states under @xmath16 10 000 and @xmath17 .",
    "for rg networks , the degree distribution @xmath56 in the stationary state is a gaussian one with mean value @xmath57 and standard deviation @xmath58 , while the @xmath59 in the initial state is a poisson distribution with @xmath60 and @xmath61 . for sf networks , @xmath62 and @xmath63",
    "are both power - laws , @xmath64 , with the similar exponent about 2.4 .",
    "the differences between @xmath62 and @xmath63 are that the fat tail in @xmath62 vanishes ; and the maximum degree decreases from the initial value of 241 to 50 in stationary state .",
    "besides , fig .",
    "4(a ) and 4(b ) show that the shape of the degree distributions is almost the same for rg and sf networks in initial and stationary states .",
    "it suggests that the general structures of the systems do not change even after a long time evolution to the stationary states .",

    "it implies that the system after undergoing a long period of evolution is composed of small highly clustered clusterings , which well fits the natural world . in ecosystems ,",
    "agents autonomously form communities , in which individuals are highly correlated .",
    "commercial airlines , for reasons of efficiency , prefer to have a small number of hubs where all routes would connect .",

    "we give further information on the evolution of the networks by comparing the topological changes between the initial and stationary states .",
    "we conclude that the networks in the stationary states are composed of small highly clustered clusterings , which well fits the evolution of complex systems in natural world .",
    "still , there are many issues to be addressed , such as the correlations and the fluctuations in @xmath13 in the evolution , especially after the stationary state .",
    "these fluctuations may tell us more about the nature of the stationary state .",
    "the behavior of the average degree in the evolution also may shed some light on the dynamics of the networks .",
    "in addition , it is worthwhile to investigate whether the evolution of networks demonstrate self - organized criticality ( soc ) , according to the similarity between the evolution of invulnerability @xmath0 with that of the envelope function @xmath18 in bak - sneppen model .",
