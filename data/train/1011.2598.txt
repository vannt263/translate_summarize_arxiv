    "a major impediment to using semi - classical general relativity is calculating the renormalized expectation value of the stress tensor .",
    "properly renormalized values for @xmath2 and @xmath3 provide information on particle production and spontaneous symmetry breaking , and are also required to calculate backreaction . since in general relativity energy density is itself a source of curvature , great care must be taken in deciding what may be dismissed as ` unphysical ' .",
    "fortunately , there are several generally accepted renormalization schemes for curved space - times @xcite . our purpose is to present a compact formula for the renormalization terms that may be applied to @xmath2 and @xmath3 calculations in arbitrary black hole space - times of even dimension .",
    "calculating @xmath3 for a general d - dimensional black hole space - time is difficult . for a scalar field , @xmath4 and its derivatives ,",
    "so we start with the simpler problem of calculating @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the hartle - hawking vacuum .",
    "note that @xmath2 is the coincidence limit of the two point function @xmath7 , and so may be expressed in terms of green s functions . in particular , the feynman green s function is related to the time ordered propagator , @xmath8 .",
    "a wick rotation allows us to work in euclidean space where @xmath9 .",
    "the euclidean green s function , @xmath10 , now obeys @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the laplace - beltrami operator in @xmath13-dimensional curved euclidean space . to solve for @xmath10 , start with the euclidean metric for a static space - time in @xmath13 dimensions with line element",

    "the only restriction for this method is that the metric must be diagonal .",
    "if the scalar field is at temperature @xmath20 , then the green s function is periodic in @xmath21 with period @xmath22 . assuming a separation of variables , standard green s function techniques lead to the formal solution @xmath23 where @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are eigenfunctions of the helmholtz equation obtained from the from the angular part of eq .",

    ", this procedure does not give the correct results for the green s function with finite point separation because it ignores global space - time properties that determine the green s function  such as the effective potential around a black hole ",
