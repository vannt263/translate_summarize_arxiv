    "the buckling of a piece of paper hitting an obstacle when ejected from a printer , the insertion of a catheter in to an artery@xcite or of steel piping in to a wellbore@xcite , even the so - called inverse spaghetti problem @xcite are all examples of mechanical settings where an elastic rod is forced out of a constraint and pushed against an obstacle . during this process the length of the rod subject to deformation changes , and when the rod is injected through a sliding sleeve , a configurational or eshelby - like force is generated , that until now has been ignored in the above - mentioned problems @xcite .",
    "this force has recently been evidenced for a cantilever beam by bigoni et al .",

    "the aim of this article is to provide direct theoretical and experimental evidence that the effect of configurational forces on the injection of an elastic rod is dominant and can not be neglected .",

    "the elastic system is analytically solved in section [ caricodipunta ] , through integration of the elastica ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is shown that eshelby - like forces strongly influence the loading path and yield a surprising force reversal , so that certain equilibrium configurations are possible if and only if the applied force changes its sign .",
    "the change of sign is shown to occur when the rotation at the inflexion points exceeds @xmath0 ( corresponding to @xmath1 ) , a purely geometric condition independent of the bending stiffness @xmath2 and distance @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , it is also proven that during loading two points of the rod come into contact and , starting from this situation ( again defined by a purely geometric condition ) , the subsequent configurations are all self - intersecting elastica .",
