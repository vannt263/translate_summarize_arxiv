    "we focus on the effects of extra power sources deep in the planet .",
    "possible heat sources include tidal dissipation due to orbital eccentricity @xcite , `` thermal tides '' @xcite , ohmic heating @xcite , and conversion of a portion of the absorbed stellar flux into kinetic energy in the atmosphere , which is then dissipated at a greater depth @xcite .",
    "while some of these mechanisms ( e.g. ohmic heating , kinetic energy dissipation ) are driven by the stellar irradiation , others ( e.g. tidal dissipation ) are not . if , as some studies suggest , excess planet inflation is correlated with the stellar irradiation @xcite , then the former class of heat deposition mechanisms is favored .",
    "we do not attempt to determine which power sources are more plausible .",
    "alternatively , in the current work we study the effects of a general power source on the cooling , and therefore the radius , of a hot jupiter . specifically , we are interested in the dependence of the planet s cooling history on the amount of additional power , and on the depth at which this power is deposited inside the planet .",
    "recently , @xcite have conducted such a study numerically ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this work we present a simple analytical model for the cooling of insolated gas giants in the presence of heat deposition somewhere in their envelope .",
    "despite our simplifications , this model describes the essential processes , and provides an intuitive explanation to the main trends of the scenario .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : irradiated ] we present our model for irradiated planets , without additional heat sources .",
    "the effects of additional deposited heat are studied in sections [ sec : deposition ] and [ sec : radius ] . in section [ sec : comparison ]",
    "we compare our results to the calculations of @xcite , and the main conclusions are summarized in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section we present our simplified `` toy model '' for irradiated gas giants , without additional heat sources .",

    "many aspects of the deposition - free model are essentially similar to a previous analytical work by @xcite , and are also implemented by @xcite .",
    "isolated gas giants , such as jupiter , are almost fully convective , with convection beginning at an optical depth @xmath11 @xcite ; see also @xcite for a reexamination .",
    "insolated planets , on the other hand , are expected to develop a deep radiative envelope @xcite .",
    "the analysis of irradiated planets is simpler when considering their profiles in the @xmath12 plane , with @xmath13 denoting the optical depth at radius @xmath14 , from the planet surface , at radius @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the radiative energy density .",
    "the density , temperature , and opacity are denoted by @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , respectively , and @xmath20 is the radiation constant .",
    "our main simplification is to assume that this profile can be approximated by a power law in the convective interior @xmath21 with @xmath22 denoting the central radiation energy density , determined by the central temperature @xmath23 .",
    "this scaling can be derived in the case of a power - law opacity @xmath24 , as assumed by @xcite and @xcite .",

    "as explained in sections [ sec : transition ] and [ sec : luminosity ] , the internal luminosity of a planet is determined by the location of the radiative - convective boundary . the optical depth ( and pressure level ) of this boundary",
    "is given by the opacity power - law which is suitable for the ( almost isothermal ) radiative - zone temperature , and does not depend on the deeper opacity structure .",
    "for planets without additional heating , this temperature is typically below @xmath33 , and we therefore get @xmath40 , by taking @xmath41 @xcite . throughout the majority of this work we adopt the approximation of small inflations relative to the zero - temperature radius ( see section [ sec : radius ] ) , implying roughly constant central densities and pressures .",
    "consequently , a constant @xmath42 is suitable for a jupiter - size planet .",

    "* ) reveals that the ratio between central and photosphere temperatures , which is given by setting @xmath11 in equation , @xmath43 , is @xmath44 , and changes only by a factor of 2 during the cooling of a jupiter mass isolated planet , consistent with our estimate .    in section [ sec : deposition ]",
    "we show that heat deposition raises the radiative - convective boundary temperature above @xmath33 , requiring a more general form , which takes into account the strong dependence of the @xmath36 opacity on the temperature @xmath45 in this case we get @xmath46 from equation , which is suitable for temperatures above @xmath33 . as we show in section [ sec : transition ] , the convective profile must satisfy @xmath47 .",
    "proximity to a star dictates an equilibrium temperature @xmath48 on the planet surface , which we take as the photosphere , at @xmath11 .",

    "close to the surface , @xmath57 is constant ( in space ) , since it is the result of cooling of the entire planet , and the heat capacity of the outer layers is negligible .",
    "therefore , we can integrate equation and find the radiative profile @xmath60 where the distinction between the boundary conditions @xmath61 at @xmath62 and @xmath11 is negligible , since we are generally interested in @xmath63 .",
    "@xcite use a similar boundary condition ( with @xmath61 at @xmath64 ) , while @xcite and @xcite define a temperature @xmath65 for their boundary condition , which is correlated with @xmath48 , therefore leading to similar conclusions .",
    "more elaborate boundary conditions , which incorporate a frequency - dependent opacity , and require the solution of the radiative transfer equation , or the use of a two - stream approximation @xcite , are beyond the scope of this work , and their effect on the temperature deep inside the radiative zone ( and therefore on the cooling rate ) can be modeled by a somewhat different effective @xmath48 .",
    "we remark that an atmosphere which is more transparent in the optical regime ( although this does not seem to be the case for hot jupiters ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may induce a greenhouse effect , which can be treated with our model as heat deposited at @xmath66 , where the depth for optical light is unity .",
    "planar symmetry , and the focus on the outer layers of the planet throughout this work , are justified both self - consistently in section [ sec : luminosity ] , and by @xcite , who find that during the 10gyr evolution of a hot jupiter , the radiative region penetrates only a few percent of the radius .      according to the schwarzschild criterion , when the radiative temperature gradient becomes larger than the adiabatic gradient , convective instability develops .",
    "differentiating equations and shows that convection sets in when @xmath67 we see from equation that at @xmath68 the profile is radiative .",
    "we also see that to ensure convection at @xmath69 , we must have @xmath47 .",

    "in other words , as long as the central temperature of the planet is high enough to ensure that a convective profile will reach @xmath11 without dropping below @xmath48 , the planet remains fully convective .",

    "this numeric value is estimated by substituting the parameters @xmath191 and @xmath192 , which are kept constant in sb2013 , the observed temperature @xmath193 @xcite , and taking the adequate @xmath46 and @xmath34 .",
    "the model of sb2013 for hd209458b is indeed inflated by @xmath194 , due to the irradiation of the parent star , even without extra power sources ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in agreement with our estimate .",
    "the zero - temperature radius @xmath195 is estimated using @xcite and @xcite , for the given surface gravity .",

    "the fraction of incident flux @xmath204 is given by sb2013 , and the translation of deposition pressure to optical depth is done approximately by @xmath205 , with @xmath19 taken from @xcite , and uncertainties going into the fitting parameter @xmath202 .",
    "the parameters in figure [ fig : compare_log ] , @xmath206 , are not , strictly speaking , a best fit , but only an illustration . a second fit , with @xmath207 and the predicted @xmath208 ,",

    "this fit , however , incorporates the more accurate nonlinear radius correction @xcite to equation .",
    "while our model is not exact , as seen in figure [ fig : compare_log ] , it does manage to describe the main trends of atmospheric heating , and , given the general uncertainties and approximations of the model , it fits the numerical calculations reasonably well over several orders of magnitude in pressure level and flux .",
    "when the realistic radius - temperature relation is used , the analytically predicted power @xmath208 fits the results adequately . with the approximated linear radius - temperature relation ,",
    "however , we fit @xmath209 to the numerical results .    in the `` weak heating '' regime @xmath210 ,",
    "it is possible to linearize equation @xmath211 which has the advantage of a single fitting parameter @xmath212 , allowing for a more intuitive interpretation of the results .",
    "in this work we presented a simplified analytical model for irradiated giant gas planets , which includes an additional heat source , deposited at an arbitrary depth inside the planet s atmosphere .    for an irradiated planet with no extra heat sources , we found useful approximate scaling relations for the internal luminosity @xmath57 of the planet , and for the radiative - convective boundary , marked by an optical depth @xmath74 .",
    "explicitly , the radiative - convective boundary and the internal luminosity are given by @xmath213 with @xmath0 , @xmath214 denoting the equilibrium luminosity and radiation energy density imposed by the stellar irradiation , respectively ( @xmath48 is the equilibrium temperature ) .",
    "@xmath70 is the central radiation energy density of the planet , and @xmath71 represents its optical depth ( with opacities extrapolated from the outer layers of the planet inward ) . the power @xmath6 is related to the adiabatic index of the planet and to the opacity near the planet s edge .",
    "in addition , we identified the condition @xmath215 , as the boundary separating insolated ( irradiated ) planets ( @xmath112 ) from isolated ones ( @xmath216 ) .",
    "these relations serve as an intuitive interpretation of well - known results @xcite .",
    "we addressed the effects of possible additional heat sources , parametrized by additional luminosity @xmath1 , deposited at an optical depth @xmath2 .",
    "such heat sources lower the internal luminosity of the planet , slow its evolutionary cooling , and are therefore candidates for solving the puzzle of over - inflated hot jupiters ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references within ) .",
    "according to our model , the figure of merit in this context is @xmath136 , with @xmath130 necessary for a significant effect .",
    "concretely , an outer convective layer is formed in this case , between optical depths @xmath3 and @xmath2 , which is equivalent to an enhanced stellar irradiation @xmath217 the internal luminosity is therefore reduced from a value of @xmath111 without extra heating to , roughly , @xmath218 with a further threshold of @xmath111 required for a significant effect .",
    "since the inflation of a planet , relative to its zero - temperature radius , is proportional to its central temperature , these relations provide an intuitive explanation to the dependence of inflation on the deposition depth @xcite , and to the large equilibrium radii , in the case of very deep heating @xcite .",
    "quantitatively , we compared our model to the recent parameter survey of @xcite .",
    "the model , though not exact , fits the numerical results adequately , considering its simplifying assumptions and approximations .",
    "the scaling laws presented in this work , combined with potential observational correlations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , may be used to rule out or to favor specific energy sources , or even the entire additional heat source paradigm .",
