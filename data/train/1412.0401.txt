    "the first property is that no edge loop is null - homotopic and the second is that no two edge loops are homotopic , keeping the vertex fixed .",
    "we call a triangulation with the first property _ essential _ and with both properties _ strongly essential_. similarly , for ideal triangulations of the interiors of compact manifolds , we say that the triangulation is _ essential _ if no ideal edge is homotopic into a vertex neighbourhood keeping its ends in the vertex neighbourhood , and is _ strongly essential _ if no two ideal edges are homotopic , keeping their ends in the respective vertex neighbourhoods .",

    "four different constructions are given of essential and strongly essential triangulations , each using a different condition on the underlying manifold .",

    "the first construction applies to closed @xmath2-irreducible 3manifolds different from @xmath3 and with non - zero first homology with @xmath4 coefficients . for these manifolds ,",
    "an essential triangulation is constructed using one - sided heegaard splittings . a similar construction , using heegaard splittings with compression bodies each containing a torus boundary component , gives essential ideal triangulations of the interiors of compact orientable irreducible atoroidal 3manifolds with boundary consisting of two incompressible tori .",
    "the second construction gives strongly essential triangulations of closed haken 3manifolds using hierarchies .",
    "a variation of this construction produces strongly essential ideal triangulations of the interiors of compact irreducible atoroidal 3manifolds with boundary consisting of incompressible tori .",
    "the third construction shows how strongly essential triangulations of non - compact complete hyperbolic @xmath0manifolds can be obtained by subdividing the polyhedral decompositions of epstein and penner  @xcite .    in the fourth construction , a one - vertex strongly essential triangulation of a closed @xmath0manifold with a riemannian metric of constant negative or zero curvature",

    "we expect that these constructions will extend to higher dimensional manifolds , but in this paper we focus on dimension three .",

    "the class of semi - angle structures contains the class of taut structures .",
    "moreover , examples of taut triangulations which are not strongly essential are given , as well as an example of a taut triangulation which is strongly essential , but does not support a strict angle structure .    in the last section ,",
    "we show that there are algorithms to decide whether a given triangulation of a closed 3manifold is essential or strongly essential , based on the fact that the word problem is uniformly solvable in the class of fundamental groups of compact , connected 3manifolds .",
    "similarly , building on work of friedl and wilton  @xcite , we show that there is an algorithm to test whether an ideal triangulation is essential based on the fact that the subgroup membership problem is solvable in the same generality",
    ". however , to test whether an ideal triangulation is strongly essential , we require the double coset membership problem to be solvable for pairs of peripheral subgroups .",
    "building on work of aschenbrenner , friedl and wilton  @xcite , we restrict this algorithm to the following three classes : topologically finite hyperbolic 3manifolds , compact seifert fibred spaces , and compact , irreducible , orientable , connected 3manifolds with incompressible boundary consisting of a disjoint union of tori .",
