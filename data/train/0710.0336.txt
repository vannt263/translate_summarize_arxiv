    "the application of flavor symmetries , notably su(3 ) , to charmed particle decays can shed light on some fundamental questions .",
    "often it is useful to know the strong phases of amplitudes in these decays .",
    "for example , the relative strong phase in @xmath0 and @xmath1 is important in interpreting decays of @xmath2 mesons to @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "such strong phases are non - negligible even in @xmath2 decays to pairs of pseudoscalar mesons ( @xmath5 ) despite some perturbative qcd expectations to the contrary , and can be even more important in @xmath6 decays . in the present report",
    "we shall illustrate the extraction of strong phases from charmed particle decays using su(3 ) flavor symmetry , primarily the u - spin symmetry involving the interchange of @xmath7 and @xmath8 quarks .",
    "we begin in section 2 by discussing the overall diagrammatic approach to flavor symmetry . in section 3",
    "we treat cabibbo - favored decays , turning to singly - cabibbo - suppressed decays in section 4 and doubly - cabibbo - suppressed decays in section 5 .",
    "we note specific applications to @xmath9 and @xmath10 decays to @xmath11 in section 6 , mention some other theoretical approaches in section 7 , and conclude in section 8 .",
    "we use a flavor - topology language for charmed particle decays first introduced by chau and cheng @xcite .",
    "these topologies , corresponding to linear combinations of su(3)-invariant amplitudes , are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : tcea ] .",
    "cabibbo - favored ( cf ) amplitudes , proportional to the product @xmath12 of cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) factors , will be denoted by unprimed quantities ; singly - cabibbo - suppressed amplitudes proportional to @xmath13 or @xmath14 will be denoted by primed quantities ; and doubly - cabibbo - suppressed quantities proportional to @xmath15 will be denoted by amplitudes with a tilde .",
    "the relative hierarchy of these amplitudes is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath18 is the cabibbo angle .    0.3 in",
    "a detailed discussion of amplitudes and their relative phases for cabibbo - favored charm decays was given in ref .",
    "the main conclusions of that analysis were large relative phases of the @xmath19 and @xmath20 amplitudes relative to the dominant @xmath21 term , and an approximate relation @xmath22 .",
    "the present updated data confirm these results .    in table",
    "[ tab : cf ] we show the results of extracting amplitudes @xmath23^{1/2}$ ] from the branching ratios @xmath24 and lifetimes @xmath25 , all from ref .",

    "new ( mainly lower ) preliminary branching ratios for many @xmath29 decays reported at this conference @xcite will change some of the results slightly once they are incorporated into averages .

    "the decays @xmath34 and @xmath35 are related to one another by the u - spin interchange @xmath36 , and su(3 ) symmetry breaking is expected to be extremely small in this relation @xcite .",

    "in contrast to the case of @xmath33 , the decays @xmath44 are not related to one another by a simple u - spin transformation .",
    "amplitudes contributing to these processes are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : dpint ] .",
    "although both processes receive color - suppressed ( @xmath19 or @xmath45 ) contributions , the cabibbo - favored process receives a color - favored tree ( @xmath21 ) contribution , while the doubly - cabibbo - suppressed process receives an annihilation ( @xmath46 ) contribution . in order to calculate the asymmetry between @xmath47 and @xmath48 production in these decays due to interference between cf and dcs amplitudes ,",
    "one can use the determination of the cf amplitudes discussed previously and the relation between them and dcs amplitudes .",

    "a similar exercise can be applied to the decays @xmath53 and @xmath54 , which are related by u - spin to the @xmath55 decays discussed here .",

    "the error on @xmath67 is not yet conclusively determined , as a result of uncertainty in fits to @xmath9@xmath10 mixing . for an eventual integrated luminosity at cleo of 750 pb@xmath66 and a cross section of @xmath68 nb one can estimate by rescaling the calculation in ref.@xcite an eventual error of @xmath69 .",
    "one can invoke effects of final state interactions to explain arbitrarily large su(3 ) violations ( if , for example , a resonance with su(3)-violating couplings dominates a decay such as @xmath70 or @xmath71 ) . as one example of this approach @xcite , both resonant and nonresonant scattering can account for the observed ratio @xmath72 .",
