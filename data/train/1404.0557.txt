    "the dispersion law for the one - dimensional ( 1d ) interacting bose gas has been calculated in a number of works .",
    "in particular , exact microscopic solutions were obtained for the uniform gas @xcite and the lower levels were found for the gas in a set of elongated traps @xcite .",
    "the experimental @xcite ratio between the lowest compressional mode and the dipole oscillation frequencies , @xmath3 , approximately agrees with the theoretical one @xcite . in the mentioned models",
    "@xcite , the actual non - point interatomic potential @xmath4 was replaced by the point - like one , @xmath5 . in works",
    "@xcite , the hydrodynamic equations were solved .",
    "they can be regarded as a consequence of the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xcite@xmath6 in the absence of external field ( @xmath7 ) , the gp equation can be derived from a more general gross equation @xcite @xmath8 if the substitution @xmath9 is made .",
    "the replacement of the actual non - point potential by the point - like one is believed to be quite justified if the @xmath10-wave scattering length @xmath11 is much shorter than the average interatomic distance .",
    "theoretical predictions made owing to this replacement approximately agree with experimental data obtained for _ non - uniform _ gases in a trap .",
    "the dispersion law for the uniform 1d gas with the point interaction is identical at the zero @xcite and periodic @xcite boundary conditions ( bcs ) .",
    "however , as was found in the recent publication @xcite , the dispersion law in the uniform gas is different at zero and periodic bcs for a non - point potential of the general form @xmath4 : this is the well - known bogolyubov law @xcite @xmath12 under periodic bcs , and the dispersion law @xmath13 under zero bcs .",
    "the difference consists in the factor @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the number of non - cyclic coordinates .",
    "this result is the first evidence that boundaries strongly affect the dispersion law in a uniform system of interacting bosons at @xmath16 .",
    "the transition to the thermodynamic limit in this system is incorrect , because it leads to different results for closed and open systems .",
    "this is not a trivial effect ; the discussion why it is possible can be found in work @xcite . to verify this strange , at first sight , result , we tried @xcite to analyze the problem in the framework of gp approach .",
    "it turned out that , if the gross equation ( [ 4 ] ) instead of the gp one is solved , two dispersion laws are obtained for the uniform 1d gas with the boundaries and without an external field : bogolyubov ( [ 2 ] ) and new ( [ 5 ] ) with @xmath2 .",
    "however , bcs were taken into consideration in ref .",
    "only partially ( it was taken into account that the wave function ( wf ) of the system changes its behavior at the boundary , but the wf value at the boundary was not set ) , and only a particular rather than general solution was found for the wf .",
    "below , we will solve the problem more precisely : a general solution for the wf will be derived , and the solutions for the wf and the dispersion law _ at zero bcs _ will be determined .    as has already been marked @xcite , solution ( [ 5 ] )",
    "has not been found earlier because either ( i ) periodic bcs were used or ( ii ) zero bcs were adopted , but the actual , non - point potential was replaced by the point - like one . in the latter case , the effect becomes lost @xcite .",
    "we confine the analysis to the simplest case of uniform 1d gas . it is not easy to solve even this problem . some considerations concerning the non - uniform gas in a trap",

    "the error obtained for @xmath59 in this case is small , and the value of @xmath171 for the packet is uniquely determined from the system of equations .",

    "most likely , the dispersion curve ( fig .  [ fig2 ] ) has a dip because small @xmath59 s were determined inaccurately .",
    "perhaps , there may exist another representation of packet ( [ 6 - 10 ] ) as a sum of harmonics , for which the wave packet has a single sharp maximum at small @xmath59 .",

    "is stretched tenfold along the @xmath219-axis , so that @xmath220 in the figure corresponds to the real @xmath220 , and @xmath221 in the figure to real @xmath222 .",

    "figure  [ fig5 ] illustrates solution ( [ 6 - 10 ] ) in the @xmath219-space ( for two arbitrary @xmath171-roots ) .",
    "the curve composed by squares looks rather strange .",
    "this density distribution is probably unstable .",
    "notice that , at small @xmath54 , the number of zeros for the function @xmath56 is considerably less than that for @xmath223 , with those two numbers getting closer as @xmath224 grows .",
    "according to the analysis given above , the following points correspond to the bogolyubov curve : one @xmath90 for every @xmath225 , two very close @xmath226 s for every @xmath227 ( @xmath228 ) , and one @xmath90 for @xmath229 .",
    "we may average over the nearest levels and consider that any interval @xmath230 includes @xmath231  points .",
    "the free energy of the system equals @xcite@xmath232 in our case , @xmath233 for the bogolyubov curve , @xmath234 does not depend on @xmath108 and leads only to the summand @xmath235 .",
    "it is unobservable , because it changes the system entropy @xmath236 but not the total energy @xmath237 and the heat capacity @xmath238 .",

    "according to available data , @xmath240 for frequencies with numbers @xmath241-@xmath242 , and @xmath243 for frequencies with numbers @xmath244 .",
    "moreover , @xmath245 chaotically changes when passing to next levels .",
    "no evident growth or decrease of @xmath245 was observed as @xmath108 grew .",
    "we found two possible dispersion laws for the uniform 1d bose gas in a box : the bogolyubov law and a new one ( [ 5 ] ) with @xmath246 .",
    "a similar problem was solved for the @xmath15-dimensional case using a more exact method @xcite , and dispersion law ( [ 5 ] ) with @xmath14 was obtained . unlike the gp method , the approach @xcite catches the structure of the system ground state . in this approach ,",
    "different ground states ( with different energies @xmath247 ) correspond to the bogolyubov and new dispersion laws .",
    "therefore , the system should be so ordered that either all phonons obey the bogolyubov dispersion law or they have dispersion law ( [ 5 ] ) with @xmath14 . in the 2d and 3d cases ,",
    "@xmath247 is lower for the new solution @xcite ; therefore , it has to be realized in the nature , whereas the bogolyubov ordering should be unstable",
    ".    how can all that be verified experimentally ?",
    "the dispersion law should be measured for the uniform bose gas , with boundaries and cyclic , and the results should be compared .",
    "a cyclic system of any dimensionality is characterized by the bogolyubov dispersion law only .",
    "as far as we know , uniform 1d systems have not been created yet .",
    "a three - dimensional system can not be made closed .",
    "however , such an experiment is quite possible for 2d films ; and this is probably the main way of verification @xcite .    a huge number of experiments are carried out now with gases in traps , but they seem not to be useful in verifying the effect .",
    "the reason is as follows . in the case of uniform system ,",
    "when changing from periodic bcs to zero ones , the second dispersion law manifests itself owing to the interaction between the harmonics in the potential expansion and the harmonics in the expansion of density oscillations in the integral in the gross equation .",
    "gas in a trap is a cloud , which is dense near the center . at a distance of about the thomas - fermi length from the center ,",
    "the concentration becomes low and rapidly decreases further .",
    "the cloud is in a vessel , the size of which is much larger than the thomas - fermi length ; therefore , the gas atoms are practically absent near the vessel walls . for this system ,",
    "oscillatory functions are characteristic ones .",
    "if the system becomes closed in the region of boundaries , oscillatory functions change only in this region .",
    "however , both the concentration and the low - order oscillatory functions are small there ; therefore , the integral in the gross equation must be almost identical under zero and periodic bcs . accordingly",
    ", the dispersion laws must also be close to each other .",
    "if the system is uniform , the characteristic functions are plane waves ( not small in the _ whole _ space ) , and the change from periodic to zero bcs manifests itself in eq .",
    "( [ 20 ] ) as the increment modification , @xmath248 , and a factor of 1/2 before @xmath249 . as a result",
    ", the integral in the gross equation brings about different solutions for periodic and zero bcs .    for gases in the trap",
    ", the integral in the gross equation does not feel the difference between the topologies of closed and open systems .",
    "therefore , it can be calculated approximately , assuming the potential to be point - like and thus changing to the gp equation .",
    "this is an ordinary way .",
    "the gp equation leads to the bogolyubov formula for the dispersion law in a uniform system .",
    "this circumstance favors the application of this formula rather than eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) as the basic dispersion law in the local density approximation ( lda ) . in the work by stringari @xcite ,",
    "the low - lying 3d levels were calculated from the gp equation , and they agreed with the experiment @xcite .",
    "for a 1d gas in the trap , experimentally measured lower levels @xcite approximately agree with theoretical ones @xcite . for the linear and square - law regions in the dispersion curve in the 3d geometry",
    ", the theory ( @xcite and lda ) approximately agrees with the experiment for @xmath250na @xcite and @xmath251rb @xcite atoms ( see also review @xcite ) .",
    "notice that , in the often used lda , the dispersion law for a localized wave packet in a non - uniform medium is assumed @xcite to be the same as for a packet in an infinite uniform environment of the same density .",
    "however , the localized packet is a superposition of nonlocal modes ; therefore , the dispersion law for the packet can turn out a nonlocal property . for today",
    ", there is no clear evidence that this is so , but the rigorous substantiation of lda is also absent .",
    "the accuracy of lda can be elucidated by constructing a wave packet on the basis of exact solutions for nonlocal modes of non - uniform system .",
    "in this work , we tried to find a dispersion law for the one - dimensional _ uniform _ bose gas under zero boundary conditions .",
    "we proceeded from the gross equation ( [ 4 ] ) making allowance for the non - point character of interaction .",
    "two solutions were found : the known bogolyubov dispersion curve ( which is reproduced with a high accuracy ) and a new curve @xmath194 that lies below the bogolyubov one .",
    "the new curve can be reliably determined at large @xmath108 s and not so reliably at small @xmath108 s .",
    "it agrees well with a solution for @xmath194 found by a different method @xcite for a one- , two- , and three - dimensional systems .",
    "the stability of solutions was not analyzed .",
    "which of two dispersion laws is realized in experiment can be elucidated by studying homogeneous rarefied he  ii films @xcite .",
    "an actual non - point potential is replaced by the point - like one , because the former is very complicated and is not known precisely , whereas the latter simplifies the equations very much . as far as we understand",
    ", this replacement is justified for the description of atomic scattering . however , for studying the collective properties of bose gas at @xmath16 , it is not justified , since the new solution becomes lost .",
    "collective oscillations and fourier components of potential are modulated by the walls @xcite , and they mutually interact in the integral in the gross equation .",
    "if the non - point character of interaction is taken into account , the fourier components strongly change , and a new solution for collective modes emerges .",
    "the problem of an influence of boundaries is interesting but not simple . to make this issue clear , unbiased researches using various theoretical methods and special experiments are required .",
