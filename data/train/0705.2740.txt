    "direct or prompt photons are photons that emerge directly from the hard scattering of the partons and not from secondary decays or as the radiation product of initial or final state partons . since these photons come directly from parton - parton hard scattering , they provide a clean signature of the underlying hard scattering dynamics .",
    "prompt photon production in hadronic interactions provides a precision test of pqcd predictions as well as information on the gluon density inside the colliding hadrons .",
    "theoretical investigations have shown@xcite that the cross - section for direct photon production has a pseudorapidity ( @xmath7 ) dependence which is sensitive to the parameterization of the gluon distributions@xcite .",
    "the lhc energy will provide an opportunity to determine gluon density in a proton in new kinematic region of @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( @xmath10)@xcite . the analysis of the lhc data in combination with results from the tevatron and hera would allow to extend the qcd analysis in @xmath9 region @xmath11@xcite .",
    "the study of physics beyond the sm at the lhc also requires a complete understanding of the qcd processes .",
    "some of the qcd processes constitute major background to other sm processes , and also to signals of new physics .",
    "thus these processes need to be well understood precisely in the new energy regime . in this work ,",
    "we have concentrated on the qcd process pp @xmath12 + 1 jet + x , where x can be anything .",
    "this process is a major background to other standard model processes such as h @xmath13@xcite , @xmath14@xcite , and signatures of physics beyond the sm such as large extra dimensions@xcite and susy@xcite .",
    "inclusive direct photon production has been studied extensively by various experiments from fixed target energies@xcite to tevatron collider@xcite .",
    "a recent study by the d0 experiment at tevatron has reported on the measurment of the triple differential cross - section for @xmath15 + jet at @xmath1=1.96 tev@xcite . in this work ,",
    "the photon + jet cross - sections has been compared to the next - to leading order ( nlo ) based on the program jetphox@xcite with cteq6.1 m pdf set of parton distribution functions@xcite . however , both the completeness of theoretical calculations and consistency of the available data have been subject of intense discussion .",
    "the results from various experiments have shown a definite pattern of deviation from theory at low @xmath16 where the measured cross sections have a steeper slope .",
    "the origin of the disagreement has been attributed to the effect of initial - state soft gluon radiation which is not properly accounted for in the theoretical calculations .",
    "it has been shown that the inclusion of some additional transverse momentum `` @xmath17 '' smearing of the partonic system due to soft - gluon emission yields better description of the data@xcite .",
    "these effects are however expected to be negligible in the kinematic range explored in the present analysis .    at the leading order ,",
    "the direct photon production is defined by two qcd processes ; quark - gluon compton scattering , @xmath18 and quark - antiquark annihilation , @xmath19 . due to abundance of low momentum fraction gluons in the proton at the lhc energy ,",
    "compton scattering becomes the dominant process contributing to the prompt photon production over most of the kinematical region .",
    "unfortunately , the advantages of photon as a clean probe of parton distributions are offset by large qcd backgrounds which are @xmath20 to @xmath21 times larger than that of direct photon signal .",
    "the background contribution to direct photon is mainly caused by the events where high @xmath16 photons are produced in the decays of neutral mesons such as @xmath22 , @xmath7 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 ; and from events where the photons are radiated from the quark ( i.e , bremsstrahlung photons in the next - to - leading order qcd subprocesses such as @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) .",
    "any analysis must separate true direct photons ( those coming from the hard scattering ) from those copiously produced in the decays of @xmath22 , @xmath7 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and bremsstrahlung photons emerging from high @xmath28 jets .",
    "isolation cuts imposed on reconstructed photon candidates effectively suppress these backgrounds@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to study the @xmath0 + jet events and its background processes with full detector simulation and reconstruction , and optimize the signal over background ( s / b ) ratio at the lhc energy .    in this work",
    ", we present the geant4 simulated results of level-3 triggered photons ( also called high level trigger ( hlt ) photons ) using cms software packages .",
    "the event generation for @xmath29 + jet signal and background processes has been done using cmkin@xcite .",
    "the passage of particles through the detector geometry , showering , energy loss in the calorimeters and reconstruction of the events are modeled in the cms simulation and reconstruction packages namely , oscar@xcite and orca@xcite respectively .",
    "the simulated result has been compared with the theoretical calculations .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows . in the next section",
    ", we discuss the physics of @xmath0 + jet .",
    "section 3 gives a brief description of the cms detector relevant for the present analysis . in section 4 ,",
    "we discuss event generation .",
    "section 5 describes photon isolation and its effect on signal and background . in section 6",
    ", we discuss the effect of @xmath3 cut between the photon and the jet on s / b .",
    "statistical and systematic uncertainties are discussed in section 7 . in the last section",
    ", we summarize this analysis with the conclusions .",
    "[ fig : lo ] shows the two leading order ( lo ) processes namely , `` quark - antiquark annihilation '' and `` quark - gluon compton scattering '' which contributes to @xmath0 + jet events . in quark - antiquark annihilation ,",
    "a direct photon is produced along with an outgoing gluon while in quark - gluon compton scattering , a gluon scatters from a quark producing a photon in the final state along with the scattered quark .",
    "an example of a next - to - leading order ( nlo ) real correction and corresponding virtual corrections ( which cancel the soft and collinear divergences arising from the real radiation ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nlo ] .",
    "if the initial parton energies are equal , the photon and the jet are produced back to back ( @xmath30 ) . in case of large imbalance between initial parton energies , the photon and the jet tend to be produced at small angles , either both forward or backward .",
    "since the gluon momentum distribution increases monotonically at lower momentum fraction values@xcite , high @xmath7 photons are likely to come from gluon compton scattering process rather than annihilation process .",
    "the main background to the direct photon signal comes from jet fluctuations .",
    "while most of the jets consist of many particles , thus easily distinguishable from a single photon , a small fraction ( @xmath31 - @xmath32 ) of jets fragments in such a way that a single particle carries most of the momentum of the parent parton .",
    "the lightest and therefore most commonly produced neutral meson , the @xmath33 decays into two photons with a branching ratio of @xmath34 .",
    "photons produced in decays of high @xmath35 @xmath33 ( and other neutral mesons ) are very close to each other in the electromagnetic calorimeter forming a single shower thus mimicking a direct photon . therefore , non - direct photons are common in hadronic collisions .",
    "since jet production rates are @xmath20 times larger than that of direct photons ( depends on @xmath36 and @xmath16 ) , the number of jets which fragment to a single meson and then decay to photons , referred as electromagnetic ( em ) jets , are comparable to the level of direct photons . the background to direct photon + jet can also come from photons produced in initial and final state radiation . in these cases ,",
    "the photon is not produced directly from the interaction vertex , and therefore , is not really a `` direct '' photon . in order to reduce the background contribution , an isolation criterion is imposed on the photon : typically a cone of size r ( in pseudorapidity @xmath37 and azimuthal angle @xmath38 ) around the photon is required to have less than a certain amount of energy . since a photon produced through bremsstrahlung tends to be collinear with the parent quark ( and thus the jet resulting from the quark s subsequent fragmentation ) , the requirement that the photon be isolated removes all but very large angle radiations .",
    "[ fig : dirph - bkjets2 ] and  [ fig : dirph - bkanam1 ] show major backgrounds to direct photons , namely , the em jets and the bremsstrahlung .",
    "the compact muon solenoid ( cms ) is a general purpose detector with 4@xmath39 steridian coverage for efficient detection and precise energy / momentum measurement of electrons , photons , muons , hadrons ( jets ) and missing transverse energy . from inside to outside",
    ", it comprises of a pixel detector , a silicon microstrip tracker system , a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) , a sampling hadronic calorimeter ( hcal ) , a 4 tesla soleniodal magnet and the muon detectors .",

    "the following part of the tracking system consists of silicon microstrip detector modules arranged in ten concentric layers in barrel and nine disks in the endcaps providing a single point resolution between 23 - 52 @xmath40 m in r-@xmath43 and 230 - 530 @xmath40 m in z. it provides the necessary lever arm for accurate momentum measurement and improves the precision of vertex measurement .",

    "the crystals are 23 cm long , have short radiation length(@xmath52 = 0.89 cm ) of moliere radius(21.9 mm ) and correspond to @xmath4226@xmath52 , thereby containing more than 99@xmath53 of the shower energy .",

    "at the lhc center of mass energy , the cross - sections for the channels pp @xmath77 + jet and pp @xmath78 jets are very large , thus making it nearly impossible to simulate direct photon signal and its background processes equivalent to an integrated luminosity of @xmath79 . in order to achieve this , a selection based on kinematic information of the particle",

    "<S> isolation cuts have been optimized for direct photon which improves the signal over background ratio by @xmath2 as compared to previous studies done in cms . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of a large @xmath3 cut between the photon and the leading jet at @xmath4 in the analysis leads to a further increase of @xmath5 in s / b , thus giving an overall gain of @xmath6 in s / b ratio .    </S>",
