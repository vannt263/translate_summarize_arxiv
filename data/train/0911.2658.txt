    "dynamics of counterion atmosphere in the vicinity of polyelectrolytes can be used as an important structural tool in order to better understand their functional properties and is thus of fundamental importance also for various areas of bio - nanotechnology and bio - medical sciences in general . in biological context , charged polyelectrolytes like deoxyribonucleic acid ( dna ) , ribonucleic acid ( rna ) , polypeptides and polysaccharides such as hyaluronic acid ( ha ) are essential for life and make their mark in many structural and functional aspects of the cellular environment @xcite .",
    "dna is in many respects a paradigm of a semiflexible highly charged polymer whose complex behavior was studied in great detail . in aqueous solutions",
    "it assumes a conformation of an extended statistical coil , whereas _ in vivo _ long genomic dna is usually compactified to fit within the micron - sized nucleus of eukaryotic cells or even smaller nano - scale viral capsids @xcite .",
    "ha is a member of the glycosaminoglycan family and is an alternating copolymer of d - glucuronic acid and n - acetyl glucosamine that occurs in connective tissue and mucous substances in the body .",
    "similarly as in the case of dna , ha always comes as a highly asymmetric salt with positive counterions , in our case as sodium salt na - ha . in aqueous solutions its carboxyl groups",
    "are completely dissociated making ha a charged polyelectrolyte . in the crystalline form ,",
    "ha covers a broad range of conformations depending on ph , whereas in solution ha is a single - stranded helix @xcite .",
    "parameters known to be relevant for the counterion dynamics in polyelectrolyte solutions include valency , strength of electrostatic interactions , concentration of polyions and added salt ions .",
    "characteristic frequencies in collective counterion dynamics span several orders of magnitude ranging from khz to mhz .",
    "these characteristic frequencies were found to be directly correlated with the details of the counterion motion around polyions @xcite .",
    "for the sake of completeness we reiterate that in the polyelectrolyte solutions one also finds a relaxation related to water , confined to the ghz range @xcite . for the strongly charged polyelectrolytes such as",
    "dna one distinguishes two distinct types of counterions : condensed counterions which are tightly bound to the polyions and free counterions .",
    "these counterion types are considered transient , meaning that there is a constant dynamic exchange between them .",
    "relaxation mode arising from the collective motion of condensed counterions takes place in the khz frequency range ( low frequency , lf mode ) , whereas the mode associated with free counterion motion is detected in the higher mhz frequency range ( high frequency , hf mode ) . in the linear regime ,",
    "i.e. , for small applied ac electric fields , these relaxation modes probe directly the conformational features of either a single polyelectrolyte chain or the structure of an ensemble of many chains in solution .",
    "our dielectric spectroscopy ( ds ) measurements on long dna semidilute solutions @xcite show that the measured fundamental length scale , probed by the lf mode , is equal to the size of the gaussian chain composed of correlation blobs that scales as @xmath1 in the low added salt limit . in the high added salt limit",
    "the lf mode characteristic length scale goes over to the odijk - skolnick - fixman ( osf ) electrostatic persistence length @xmath2 and scales as @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath4 is the dna structural persistence length of 50  nm and @xmath5 is the ionic strength of the added salt . on the other hand",
    ", the hf mode is probing the collective properties of the dna solution which are characterized by the de gennes - pfeuty - dobrynin ( dgpd ) correlation length or the solution mesh size , that scales as @xmath6 .",
    "this result was equally reported on diverse synthetic polyelectrolytes @xcite .",
    "an intriguing issue is if and how the dielectric relaxation modes will change for polyelectrolytes , such as ha , which are much more flexible than dna , i.e. , how is the counterion dynamics affected when the structural persistence length becomes smaller than the dominating correlation length .",
    "we note that the double - stranded dna ( ds - dna ) is best described as a strongly charged semi- flexible polyelectrolyte whose structural persistence length , @xmath4 close to 50  nm , is larger than the correlation length .",
    "another interesting issue is what happens in the case of weakly charged polyelectrolytes , again such as ha , whose manning charge density parameter @xmath7 , so that according to the manning criterion no counterion condensation takes place .",
    "here @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the valency of the counterion , @xmath10 is the linear charge spacing and @xmath11 is the bjerrum length .",
    "the question then arises whether or not free counterions , in addition to their primary role , take over the role of condensed counterions as in strongly charged polyelectrolytes .",
    "in other words , do free counterions , in addition to oscillating between the correlated polyion chains in the solution , also perform an oscillatory motion along the polyion chain revealing in this way the conformational features of a single chain .",
    "previous dna studies have shown that the lf relaxation mode does not allow a clearcut separation between condensed and free counterions as relaxation entities and that both of them contribute to various extent in different salt and dna concentration regimes @xcite .    in this work",
    "we address these issues by characterizing the dynamic behavior of semidilute solutions of a sodium salt of hyaluronic acid ( na - ha ) .",
    "ha is a weakly charged polyelectrolyte whose disaccharide monomer is 1  nm long implying the manning charge density parameter @xmath12 .",
    "the structural persistence length is about 9  nm @xcite and is larger than the monomer size so that , according to the standard criterion , ha belongs to semiflexible polyelectrolytes , being much stiffer than the standard synthetic polyelectrolyte polystyrene sulfonate na - pss , but at the same time much more flexible than ds - dna .",
    "in this study we used hyaluronic acid sodium salt from streptococcus equi sp .",
    "fluka 53747 obtained from sigma - aldrich .",
    "the low protein content @xmath13 is declared by the manufacturer .",
    "an average molecular weight is about @xmath14  daltons , implying 4000 monomers in average . for ha ,",
    "disaccharide monomer is of molecular weight 401  g / mol and there is one na@xmath15 ion per ha monomer .",
    "this means that the molar concentrations of ha monomers , as well as na@xmath15 counterions are related by @xmath16 = c_\\mathrm{ha } \\left[\\textrm{mg / ml}\\right ] \\times 2.5 $ ]  @xmath17mol / mg to the ha concentration by weight .",
    "we perform a systematic study of how the dielectric properties of these polydisperse long ha fragments in aqueous solutions evolve upon change of ha concentration and added salt over a range of two orders of magnitude .",
    "ha solutions were prepared as described previously ( see materials and methods i in ref .",
    "@xcite , preparation protocols i and ii.1 ) . a crude estimate of the crossover concentration between dilute and semidilute regime @xmath18 based on the de gennes arguments @xcite , and taking into account that the average ha fragments are 4  @xmath17 m long , yields @xmath18 of the order of @xmath19  mg / ml , which is more than two orders of magnitude below the lower concentration bound in our experiments @xcite .",
    "this means that we are effectively always in semidilute regime which has been studied in depth experimentally in the case of long polydisperse dna fragments in aqueous solutions @xcite .",
    "dielectric spectroscopy up to 100 mhz is usually performed with a capacitance chamber @xcite . there",
    ", a sample solution is applied between the electrodes of a parallel plate capacitor and a frequency dependent impedance is measured .",
    "we performed our measurements with an in - house designed chamber , with built - in temperature control .",
    "the chamber was connected in a 4-terminal pair configuration to an agilent 4294a precision impedance analyzer @xcite .",
    "the measurement functions were conductance @xmath20 and the capacitance in parallel @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is frequency .",
    "these combine into complex admittance ( inverse of complex impedance @xmath23 ) : @xmath24 admittance is sampled at 201 frequencies , i.e. , at 33 points per frequency decade for the frequency range 100hz-110 mhz .",
    "a single frequency point is sampled with bandwidth bw=5 setting ( longer acquisition time , but lower noise - bw=1 would be faster , however more noisy , and would demand averaging 10 times for one point ) .",
    "in addition , three consecutive frequency sweeps are taken in order to average out the temperature variations .",
    "total time for the spectrum measurement amounts to 120  s.    in the measurements with a capacitance chamber a well - known electrode polarization ( ep ) influences the results .",
    "ep is due to the rearrangement of ions and a build - up of spatial charge in the vicinity of the electrodes , which manifests itself as a large frequency dependent capacitance , @xmath25 , in series with the sample chamber impedance - impedance of a capacitor containing a conducting dielectric .",
    "ep can be roughly represented in khz range ( for simple electrolytes at concentrations below 10 mm ) by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 .",
    "ep also strongly reduces measured conductance , @xmath28 in the same low - frequency range .",
    "the effect is proportional to the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte , i.e. , to its ionic strength @xmath29 .",
    "the contributions ( of polarization currents ) due to the system of interest ( e.g. , polyelectrolyte , colloid ) may be extracted only in the frequency range where they are of comparable or larger magnitude than ep effects .",
    "this practically limits dielectric spectroscopy below 100 mhz to studies of samples in electrolytes with @xmath29 not above 10 mm @xcite .",
    "various experimental methods @xcite aim to reduce the ep effect , e.g. , 4-contact measurement cells @xcite , electromagnetic induction measurement methods or simple utilization of the microporous , platinum black electrodes ( however , pt - black deteriorates with repeated usage @xcite ) .",
    "a different approach is to model the ep contribution to the sample impedance and consequently remove it .",
    "however , while this may be done in theory , in practice , every new polyelectrolyte solution presents itself as a system where the ep effect can have a different influence , and our incomplete understanding of this phenomenon reappears @xcite . even for a simple capacitance chamber there",
    "remain two experimental approaches for reduction of ep .",
    "the first one is to make measurements at different electrode separations @xcite .",
    "then , as ep effect is the only one dependent on the electrode surface area as opposed to the volume- dependent sample contribution , one can distinguish the two contributions .",
    "the second ep reduction approach is the reference subtraction method @xcite which is used in our work .",
    "in addition to ha samples , the reference samples of a simple electrolyte nacl were also measured and corresponding spectra subtracted from ha spectra in order to minimize stray impedances , including the free ion contribution and ep effects , and extract the response due to ha only @xcite .",
    "naturally , this method has limitations in the sense that the ep effects are not necessarily the same for the sample and reference solutions - an issue similar to the abovementioned ep modeling methods @xcite .    while recognizing its limitations , we have chosen the reference subtraction method , and designed our setup accordingly , as it allows for quick data analysis and high sample throughput ( a sample is exchanged every 10 minutes ) with a minimal sample volume ( 100  @xmath17l ) .",
    "[ fig1](a ) and ( b ) shows the 0.1  mg / ml ha pure water solution conductance and capacitance spectra in conjunction with data for 0.14  mm nacl reference solution of matching conductance ( matched at 100  khz ) .",
    "the corresponding curves show only a small mismatch which indicates that the main contributions come from the free ion conduction or the ep effect , while the contribution of interest @xmath20 , @xmath21 , which is due to the polyion and its counterion atmosphere , is minor . therefore , assuming that the conductivity contribution of each entity in the solution is additive @xcite , we have treated the contribution of interest additively : @xmath30 and fig .",
    "[ fig1](c),(d ) shows the result of this subtraction .",

    "we note that the capability of the reference subtraction procedure to remove the ep effects diminishes ( low frequency bound increases ) with increasing concentration and total sample conductivity . for this reason the highest successfully analyzed na - ha concentration was 1.25 mg / ml .",

    "two origins of these differences might be envisaged .",
    "first is the rather weak fixed charge on the ha molecule leading to the absence of manning condensation and second is a much higher flexibility of the ha , whose persistence length is about 9  nm as opposed to 50  nm for the ds - dna .      we first describe the characteristics of the hf mode . for pure water ha solutions the characteristic length @xmath78 decreases with increasing ha concentration in two decades wide concentration range following the power law @xmath79 as a function of the ha concentration ( main panel of fig .",

    "this reflects the decrease in the dielectric strength @xmath123 of the mode itself , since the product @xmath124 is a constant due to the fact that @xmath94 is a renormalized debye screening length which scales as @xmath0 ( see eq .  [ r_bfc ] ) .",
    "this result indicates that the concentration - independent manning - based definition for the number of oscillating counterions is not valid in this case .",
    "presumably , as the screening due to other polyions and counterions increases with concentration it might reduce the effective number of counterions participating in the lf relaxation along the renormalized debye length @xmath99 .",
    "on the other hand , data displayed in panel ( b ) suggest that @xmath121 becomes larger in the case of added salt solutions compared to the pure water case , once the concentration of added salt ions becomes larger than @xmath125 and relaxation happens along the electrostatic persistence length .",
    "a similar effect was observed for dna solutions and ascribed to the intrinsic counterion atmospheres squeezed closer to the chains @xcite .",
    "first , we comment the issue of respective roles in screening of ha counterions and ions from the added salt in the light of previously obtained results on long dna @xcite . for both systems the influence of added salt is important as long as the added salt concentration @xmath126 is sufficiently larger than the concentration of intrinsic counterions @xmath127 . however , whereas for dna we observed that these two regimes are delimited at about @xmath128 , for na - ha this occurs at higher added salt levels @xmath129 . since in the case of ha all intrinsic counterions are free , while there are only 25% free in the case of dna",
    ", this result might indicate that the effective counterion screening is due primarily to the free counterions and not to condensed ones .",
    "such a result is not surprising since the proper description of strongly charged polyelectrolytes such as dna , with large charge densities that produce nonlinearities , is standardly tackled by taking into account the manning condensation while retaining the linearized debye - hckel ( dh ) theory for the remaining salt .",
    "conversely , in the case of weakly charged polyelectrolytes , such as ha , the dh approximation can be used without fundamental modifications .",
    "second , our understanding of the lf mode provides additional details in the scenario for the hf mode .",
    "we remind that in the case of the long dna the dgpd correlation length gives way to the debye screening length as a new relevant length scale for hf mode .",
    "this occurs exactly when sufficient salt is added so that the corresponding debye screening length becomes comparable to and eventually smaller than the dgpd correlation length @xcite . on the other hand , in the case of ha",
    "the screening length is revealed as the pertinent length scale for the lf mode . only at very high added salt concentrations , the screening length and",
    "the correlation length observed in the hf mode , will theoretically become comparable .",
    "for example , at @xmath130  mg / ml the correlation length @xmath131  nm ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] ) could become comparable to @xmath94 at added salt concentration @xmath132  mm [ see fig .  [ fig6](b ) ] .",
    "thus we expect the correlation length to remain relevant for hf mode at the added salt concentrations at least one order of magnitude higher than practically measurable with our technique .    in what follows we address possible reasons for why the lf relaxation mode observed for the ha polyelectrolyte yields @xmath94 scaling laws which differ from the ones observed in the long dna case @xcite .",
    "the first issue concerns the salt - free regime in which the average size of the gaussian chain which scales as @xmath133 , previously observed for long dna , is replaced in the case of ha by the renormalized debye screening length which scales as @xmath134 .",
    "we suggest that the absence of manning condensed counterions due to weaker electrostatic interactions , characterized by a charge density parameter @xmath7 , might be at the origin of this observation .",
    "we base this suggestion on the experimental data on long dna , reported before , that have indicated that for the lf relaxation in the salt - free regime it is mostly the condensed counterions that oscillate along or in close proximity to an individual chain in the polyelectrolyte solution , except at large enough salt concentrations where at least some of the free counterions seem to join in in playing this role .",
    "contrary , in the case of ha only free counterions , manning condensed being absent , participate in the lf relaxation and their oscillation in the volume around the chain naturally brings in the renormalized debye screening length , which has a stronger concentration dependence and therefore appears as a more pertinent length scale than the average size of the chain .",
    "the second issue is why for ha with finite added salt the characteristic length scale of counterion dynamics , that for dna allowed an association with the osf electrostatic persistence length , is replaced by the electrostatic persistence length which scales linearly with debye length @xmath135 , i.e. , as @xmath116 .",
    "we consider it plausible that a much higher flexibility of ha , as compared to dna , might be responsible for this change , so that the osf approach in which the chain is modeled as a rigid rod would be invalidated .",
    "this has been already stressed and discussed at length by ullner @xcite and others @xcite .",
    "here we note that the controversy concerning the conformational properties of flexible polyelectrolytes in the presence of added salt has been discussed over the last fifty years without reaching a firm consensus @xcite .",
    "in particular , the electrostatic persistence length has been reported to depend both quadratically and linearly on the debye screening length .",
    "the former is a result of the analytical approaches based on the osf - like perturbational calculation in which the polyelectrolyte is modeled as a rigid rod , whereas the latter comes out from the variational calculation for a flory - type flexible chain .",
    "a weak point in both approaches is the assumption that there is a single behavior that describes the chain on all length scales .",
    "recently , ullner has argued @xcite that a consistent picture might emerge taking into account simulations with a careful analysis of analytical approaches . according to his arguments",
    ", three regimes can be distinguished with respect to the scaling of the persistence length with the debye screening length . in the first two regimes where @xmath135 is larger or comparable to the size of the chain , @xmath136 , the chain thus being rather stiff , it behaves as a rod - like chain , so that the osf approach is valid and @xmath117 . in the third regime where @xmath135 is small or",
    "the chain is weakly charged @xcite , the chain is flexible enough to allow distant parts to get close , which gives rise to increased long - range correlations so that the excluded volume effects start playing an important role which affects the average size of the molecule in a way that corresponds to a linear or even a sublinear dependence of the persistence length on the ionic strength @xmath5 .",
    "there are various expressions for the scaling exponent of the electrostatic persistence length on the ionic strength in this regime , with the simplest one yielding behavior close to @xmath137 @xcite .",
    "obviously these excluded volume effects are much less pronounced in the case of dna , which is intrinsically a stiff molecule .",
    "we find it difficult to apply the criterion @xmath135 versus the chain size @xmath136 in the case of experimentally studied system , since @xmath135 is always much smaller than @xmath136 .",
    "rather we suggest that the comparison of the structural persistence length @xmath4 and the correlation length @xmath81 should be more meaningful in this regard .",
    "indeed , the comparison of @xmath4 ( 50  nm for dna and 9  nm for ha ) and the correlation length @xmath81 in the same concentration range ( 1050  nm for dna and 445  nm for ha ) indicates that while for dna @xmath138 , for ha exactly the opposite relationship holds , @xmath139 , indicating a much higher ha flexibility if compared to dna .",
    "this stronger flexibility of ha leads in its turn to a weaker dependence of the electrostatic persistence length on added salt concentration because of the more pronounced excluded volume effects .",
    "indeed , by reanalyzing viscosity data tricot has demonstrated the validity of @xmath116 for different flexible polyelectrolytes with structural persistence length between 2 and 20  nm @xcite .",
    "in addition , he has shown that @xmath2 does not diverge at vanishing added salt concentration , rather it reaches the maximum value that may be much smaller than the polymer extended length @xmath64 .",
    "additional confirmation to corroborate these results comes from transient electric birifrigence measurements performed on flexible na - pss for a range of low added salt concentrations similar to ones used in our dielectric spectroscopy measurements @xcite .    on the other hand , recent small angle neutron scattering ( sans ) experiments on ha for added salt concentrations larger than 1  mm , reveal the osf behavior for the electrostatic persistence length @xcite .",
    "however , a closer inspection of fig .  10 in ref .",
    "@xcite and of fig .  3 in ref .",
    "@xcite reveals that the apparent osf behavior of data critically depends on the 0.1  m ( 0.2  m ) single data point which is not obtained from experiment , but is rather calculated from the osf formula .",
    "this result apparently contradicts our results obtained by dielectric spectroscopy measurements , but only for added salt concentrations smaller than 1  mm .",
    "we can conceive two possible reasons for this discrepancy .",
    "the first cause might be associated with different added salt regimes .",
    "another cause might lie in the fact that the sans experiments were done on much shorter ha chains than our ds experiments , and the analysis of the sans data was based on theory in which excluded volume effects were neglected . in future , more efforts are needed in order to elucidate the crossover behavior between low and high added salt regimes as far as ha and other flexible polyelectrolytes are concerned .",
    "this task however appears to be a rather difficult one for the following reason . the low added salt regime , below a few mm , can be probed only by very few experimental techniques , which can not be used for high added salt concentrations , among which dielectric spectroscopy appears as the most reliable one .",
    "the opposite holds for the high salt regime above 5  mm or so : a number of techniques , while they can not be used for low added salt , can cover this regime ranging from viscosity measurements to sans experiments .",
    "it thus seems impossible to find a single technique for continuously following the conformational change of the polyion over a broad added salt concentration range .",
    "all these results make it quite clear that the standard criterion to discriminate flexible against semiflexible polyelectrolytes , which compares the structural persistence length with the monomer size , can not be always strictly applied .",
    "it also appears difficult to apply the criterion @xmath135 _ vs. _  @xmath136 as argued by ullner _",
    "et al . _",
    "another criterion which considers the structural persistence length in comparison with the correlation length appears to be of key importance which determines , at least for added salt concentrations below few mm , the outcome of two competing electrostatic persistence lengths : the one scaling linearly with the debye length versus the one scaling quadratically with the debye length , i.e. , the odijk - skolnick - fixman length . keeping this in mind , regarding the salt dependence of its persistence length",
    "the ha seems to be somewhere in between the semiflexible dna and the flexible na - pss .",
    "in conclusion , our results demonstrate that in the case of low added salt there are basically two fundamental length scales that determine the dielectric response of semidilute solutions of semiflexible polyelectrolyte ha : de gennes - pfeuty - dobrynin semidilute solution correlation length and de gennes - dobrynin electrostatic screening length .",
    "the first length scale is important for the high frequency response , while the second one is important for the low frequency response .",
    "collective properties probed by the high frequency dielectric relaxation are thus well described by the de gennes - pfeuty - dobrynin solution correlation length predicted and proven to be valid for both flexible and semiflexible chains .",
    "single - chain properties probed by the low frequency relaxation are described by the electrostatic persistence length that scales linearly with the debye length , contrary to the dna case where the scaling is quadratic as rationalized by the osf formula .",
    "this difference is most probably due to the fact that the ha chain is much more flexible than the dna chain , precluding the straightforward application of the osf arguments .",
    "this also indicates that ha , as far as its flexibility is concerned , is half - way between semiflexible and completely flexible polyelectrolytes . in the salt - free regime",
    "the de gennes - dobrynin screening length is due to ha counterions only , which can thus be described by a renormalized debye screening length that apparently prevails as the fundamental single - chain property probably due to the absence of the condensed counterions in the weakly charged polyelectrolyte .",
    "finally , our results reveal that the standard theoretical approaches based on the concentration - independent manning parameter @xmath83 face some limitations when applied to the dielectric response of the counterion atmosphere around polyions .",
    "these theories describe well the hf dielectric relaxation along the correlation length , with its concentration - independent fraction of oscillating counterions @xmath140 . on the other hand",
    ", they fail to offer a proper description of the lf relaxation characterized by the renormalized debye screening length . for this relaxation ,",
    "the effective number of counterions decreases with increasing concentration , which might be ascribed to enhanced screening due to other polyions and counterions .",
