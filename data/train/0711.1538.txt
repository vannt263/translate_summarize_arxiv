    "the organic superconductors have proved to be valuable systems for exploring strong correlation physics near the metal - insulator transition : it is possible to tune parameters across the metal - insulator transition by moderate pressure , while maintaining a commensurate density of carriers .",
    "of particular interest are the series of compounds which realize a half - filled band of electrons on a triangular lattice . in the insulator ,",
    "three distinct ground states are realized in closely related compounds : ( _ i _ ) a nel ordered state @xcite in @xmath3-(et)@xmath4 cu[n(cn)@xmath4]cl ( _ ii _ ) a recently discovered valence bond solid ( vbs ) state @xcite in etme@xmath5p[pd(dmit)@xmath4]@xmath4 , and ( _ iii _ ) an enigmatic spin liquid state @xcite in @xmath3-(et)@xmath4cu@xmath4(cn)@xmath5 . under pressure , all these compounds undergo a transition to a superconducting state .",
    "the nearest - neighbor @xmath7 heisenberg antiferromagnet on the triangular lattice is believed to have a small , but non - zero , average magnetic moment @xcite .",
    "however , perturbations such as ring and second - neighbor exchange are likely to be present near the metal - insulator transition , and these presumably yield the non - magnetic states noted above",
    ". this paper will examine the organic compounds from the perspective of a particular spin - liquid insulating ground state : the @xmath0 spin liquid of bosonic spinons proposed in refs .  .",
    "an advantage of this state is that it is a very natural starting point for building the entire phase diagram : theories of the transitions out of this @xmath0 spin liquid state into the magnetically ordered ( nel ) state @xcite and the valence bond solid state @xcite have already been presented , thus realizing the three classes of insulators which are observed in these compounds .    the core analysis of this paper concerns the insulator - to - metal transition on the triangular lattice @xcite out of the @xmath0 spin liquid state .",
    "the spin - charge separation of the insulating spin liquid state ( and the associated @xmath0 topological order ) will survive across the transition into the metallic state , and so this is a insulator - metal transition between two ` exotic ' states .",
    "however , our theory generalizes easily to the other ` non - exotic ' insulators with conventional order noted above : in these cases it is the conventional order which survives across the transition , rather than the topological order .",
    "thus our study of the @xmath0 spin liquid state offers a convenient context in which to study the insulator - metal transition , with a focus on the charged excitations in the simplest situation .",
    "subsequently , we can include the spin - sector instabilities of the @xmath0 spin liquid to conventionally ordered confining states ; these do not modify the physics of the insulator - metal transition in a significant manner .",
    "our perspective on the insulator - metal transition should be contrasted to that in dynamical mean - field theory @xcite ( dmft ) .",
    "dmft begins with a correlated metallic state , and presents a theory of the metal - to - insulator transition .",
    "partly as a consequence of its focus on the metal , it does a rather poor job of capturing the superexchange interactions in the insulator , and the consequent resonating valence bond ( rvb ) correlations .",
    "instead , we begin with a theory of rvb - like correlations in the insulator , and then develop a theory of the charged excitations ; the closing of the gap to these charged excitations describes the insulator - to - metal transition .",
    "a theory of the closing of the charge gap in an rvb insulator has also been discussed recently by hermele @xcite , but for an insulator with gapless fermionic spinons on the honeycomb lattice .    for a half - filled band ,",
    "our main result is that prior to reaching the metallic state , the insulator has an instability to a state with _",
    "exciton condensation_@xcite , associated with the pairing of fermions of charge @xmath8 with fermions of charge @xmath2 . as in the conventional theory @xcite , the pairing arises because of the attractive coulomb interaction between these oppositely charged fermions , while the charge gap to these fermionic excitations is still finite , but small .",
    "the excitonic insulator maintains the charge gap , but is associated with a breaking of the lattice space group symmetry which we shall describe .",
    "eventually , fermi surfaces of charge @xmath9 fermions appear , leading to a metallic state in which the excitonic instability ( and the lattice symmetry breaking ) can also survive .",
    "we propose that the above instability offers a resolution of a central puzzle in the properties of the ` spin liquid ' compound @xmath3-(et)@xmath4cu@xmath4(cn)@xmath5 . at a temperature around 10k a feature",
    "is observed @xcite in nearly all observables suggesting a phase transition into a mysterious low temperature correlated state",
    ". an important characteristic of this compound is the indication from optical conductivity measurements @xcite that the charge gap of this insulator is quite small , suggesting its proximity to the metal - insulator transition even at ambient pressure .",
    "we propose the 10k transition occurs in the charge sector , and is a consequence of the appearance of the excitonic insulator .",
    "observation of the lattice symmetry breaking associated with the excitonic insulator state is an obvious experimental test of our proposal .",
    "there is a suppression of the spin susceptibility below the transition , and this can arise in our theory from the strong coupling between the fermionic charge carriers and the spinons ; this coupling is given by the large hopping term , @xmath10 in a @xmath10-@xmath11 model , and we will discuss a number of consequences of this term .",
    "the @xmath0 spin liquid state upon which our excitonic insulator state is based has a gap to all spin excitations , and this is potentially an issue in applications to @xmath3-(et)@xmath4cu@xmath4(cn)@xmath5 .",
    "however , as we have already mentioned above , our theory is easily extend across the critical point to the onset of magnetic order .",
    "we propose that the spin gap is very small due to proximity to this critical point , and that along with the effect of impurities , this can possibly explain the large density of states of gapless spin excitations observed in ref .  .",
    "indeed , the @xmath12 dependence of the spin susceptibility fits the predictions of the nearest - neighbor heisenberg antiferromagnet reasonably well , and the latter model is believed to be very close to a quantum phase transition at which the nel order disappears @xcite .",
    "the central focus of this paper will be on the charged excitations of the @xmath0 spin liquid .",
    "these will spinless fermions of charge @xmath9 : we call the charge @xmath1 fermion a ` holon ' , and the charge @xmath2 fermion a ` doublon '",
    ". we will begin with a theory of the dispersion spectrum of single holons and doublons in section  [ sec : holon ] .",
    "the remaining sections of the paper will consider various many - body states that can appears in a finite density liquid of these fermions .",
    "the states we will find are : + ( _ i _ ) * excitonic condensates * : this will be discussed in section  [ sec : mft - exciton ] .",
    "here there is an instability towards the pairing between a holon and doublon to form a condensate of neutral bosons .",
    "the only physical symmetry broken by this pairing is the space group symmetry of the triangular lattice , and so the state with an excitonic condensate has a spatial modulation in the electronic charge density .",
    "we find this state as an instability of the insulating @xmath0 spin liquid , which then reaches an insulating state with an excitonic condensate .",
    "however , eventually fermi surfaces of holons and doublons can develop , leading to a metallic state with an excitonic condensate .",
    "+ ( _ ii _ ) * metals * : as the repulsion energy @xmath13 in a hubbard model becomes smaller , we will find that fermi surfaces of the holons and doublons can appear ( as has just been noted in the discussion of excitonic condensates ) .",
    "such states are realizations of ` algebraic charge liquids ' ( acls ) introduced recently in ref .  , and these will be discussed further in section  [ sec : lutt ] .",
    "the simplest such states inherit the topological order of the @xmath0 spin liquid .",
    "the areas enclosed by the fermi surfaces in these fractionalized metallic states obey a modified luttinger theorem , whose form will be discussed in section  [ sec : lutt ] .",
    "we will also discuss the possible binding of holons and doublons to spinons , and the eventual appearance of conventional fermi liquid metallic states .",
    "+ ( _ iii _ ) * superconductors * : the metallic states above are also susceptible to a conventional bcs instability to a superconducting state , by the condensation of bosons of charge @xmath14 . this will be discussed in section  [ sec : sc ] .",
    "the required attractive interactions between pairs of holons ( or pairs of doublons ) is driven by the exchange of spinon excitations of the @xmath0 spin liquid .",
    "we will compute this interaction , and show that it favors a superconductor in which the physical electronic pair operators have a @xmath15 pairing signature .",
    "as we noted in section  [ sec : intro ] , the central actor in our analysis , from which all phases will be derived , is the insulating @xmath0 spin liquid state on the triangular lattice @xcite .",
    "a review of its basic properties , using the perspective of the projective symmetry group @xcite is presented in appendix  [ sec : mfa ] .    here",
    "we will extend the @xmath7 antiferromagnet to the @xmath10-@xmath11 model on the triangular lattice and describe the spectrum of the charged holon and doublon excitations of the @xmath0 spin liquid . because of the spin - charge separation in the parent @xmath0 spin liquid , both the holons and doublons are spinless , but carry a unit charge of the @xmath0 gauge field of the spin liquid .",
    "the distinct metallic , insulating , and superconducting phases which can appear in a system with a finite density of holons and doublons are described in the subsequent sections .",
    "we consider the usual @xmath10-@xmath11 model on a triangular lattice : @xmath16 where @xmath17 are sites of the triangular lattice .",
    "as discussed in appendix  [ sec : mfa ] , the @xmath0 spin liquid is realized by expressing the the spins in terms of schwinger bosons @xmath18 . here , we introduce spinless , charge @xmath8 , fermionic holons , @xmath19 , and spinless , charge @xmath2 , fermionic doublons , @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 all carry a unit @xmath0 charge . at half - filling",
    ", the density of holons must equal the density of doublons , but our formalism also allows consideration of the general case away from half - filling with unequal densities .",
    "we can now expression the electron annihilation operator @xmath21 in terms of the these degress of freedom by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the antisymmetric unit tensor .",
    "a similar spin - charge decomposition of the electron into spinons was discussed in the early study of zou and anderson @xcite , but with the opposite assignment of statistics _",
    "i.e. _ fermionic spinons and bosonic holons . in our case , the choice of statistics is dictated by the choice of the @xmath0 spin liquid we are considering .    with the spin liquid background ,",

    "one spinon and one holon may form a bound state if we take into account the interaction between the two due to the hopping term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tterm ] ) .",
    "again , we need to include the effect of constraint ( [ eq : cp - constraint ] ) ; in other words , we need to consider the contribution from the fluctuation of @xmath125 field shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : inter - lambda ] .              for the same reason we gave in appendix [ sec : interaction ] , the one loop correction due to the fluctuation of @xmath125 field needs to be combined with the zero - th order contribution from equation [ eq : interac - tree ] .",
    "this is represented by fig .",
    "[ fig : fbinteract - oneloop ] and is expressed by the following equation            add the two contributions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fbgamma - tree ] ) and ( [ eq : fbgamma - oneloop ] ) together , one immediately see that the terms not depend on @xmath166 and @xmath169 in equation ( [ eq : fbgamma - tree ] ) will be canceled by corresponding terms in the other term , due to the definition of @xmath170 in equation ( [ eq : pi ] ) .",
    "this yields to the following result @xmath171            [ ( \\nu_m+\\omega_n)^2+(\\bm{k}_1^\\prime-\\bm{q})^2+m_s^2]}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is easy to see that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fbgamma - twoparts ] ) , the interaction can be seperated into two parts : the first term is a simple one but with a dependence on @xmath166 , which does not appear in usual two - body interactions ; the second one is the result of a loop integral and only depends on the transfered momentum and energy .",
    "the asymptotic behaviors of the second term in @xmath172 and @xmath173 can be studied by the same dimension analysis method used in appendix [ sec : interaction ] . by counting the power of @xmath174 in the loop integral",
    "one can see that the most divergent term is proportional to @xmath175 , and the term in the next order does not depend on @xmath175 . however ,",
    "unlike the case in equation ( [ eq : gamma - k2-lambda - final ] ) , here the divergent term does give a @xmath167 and @xmath176 dependent interaction because of the @xmath177 prefactor .",
    "therefore the dominant term in equation ( [ eq : fbgamma - twoparts ] ) is          the bound state problem can be solved by solving bethe - salpeter equation@xcite . in order to see the qualitative results of the binding potential in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fbgamma - dominant ] ) we ignored the frequency dependence and assume that the dispersion relations of holon and spinon are both non - relativistic . in this case",
    "the bethe - salpeter equation for the relative motion is      where @xmath180 is the relative momentum ; @xmath36 is the reduced mass in center of mass frame ; @xmath181 is the bound state energy ; @xmath182 is the total momentum in the center of mass frame ; @xmath183 is the wave function of relative motion in the momentum space .",
    "numerical calculation shows that there can be one or more bound states due to the interaction ( [ eq : fbgamma - dominant ] ) .",
    "in general , the interaction depends on both the relative momentum @xmath180 , @xmath184 and the total momentum @xmath182 .",
    "however , the dominant term ( [ eq : fbgamma - dominant ] ) only depends on @xmath185 .",
    "moreover , although the full interaction ( [ eq : fbgamma - twoparts ] ) depends on all momenta , the dependence on @xmath182 can be separated @xmath186 therefore the motion of the center of mass can still be separated from the relative motion , and the bound state energy can be written as @xmath187 where @xmath181 is the bound state energy which does not depend on @xmath182 , and @xmath188 , @xmath110 are masses of holon and spinon respectively .",
    "consequently the bound states have minimal energy at @xmath189 . since the momenta we use in this appendix are all measured from the center of spinon and holon energy minimums , the position of the bound state energy minimum is the sum of holon and spinon minimums .",
    "the former is at the origin ; the later is at @xmath108 .",
    "therefore the position of bound state minimums is also @xmath190 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hexagon ]    for doublons , we can also get an attractive interaction between them and spinon from eq .",
    "( [ eq : hint - g - ft - lambda ] ) . because of the same dimension analysis argument the interaction has the same form as ( [ eq : fbgamma - dominant ] ) .",
    "therefore , the bound state of doublon and spinon , or electron excitation locates at the sum of momenta of doublon and spinon , which is also shown in fig .",
