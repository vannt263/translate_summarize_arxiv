    "there are admittedly more sophisticated mathematical functions that could fit the data much better than eq . @xmath85 , such as those given by nacre@xcite . however , we must follow the format of reaclib otherwise we should be dealing with a different reaction rate library of a different format ( whose fitting function might be taxing the computer considerably )",

    "the nacre  data are given in the form of an array of values ( rates with respect to temperature plus uncertainties ) which is the result of combining various individual rate components , namely : non - resonant , narrow resonant+tails , broad resonant and multi  resonant rates .",
    "it is impossible to extract the individual rates from the combined nacre  tabular data although that is necessary in our work due to the format of reaclib .",
    "fortunately , the nacre authors have also derived analytical approximations to each of these rate components , thus providing a tool for uploading the new nacre  rates into reaclib .",

    "@xmath86 to their natural logarithms , which is a more accurate approach .    as for the non - resonant rate of resonant reactions , in several cases we have calculated the non - resonant rates by using the numerical integration formalism adopted by nacre@xcite .",
    "this was necessary in order to verify that the analytic formula given by nacre has not been misprinted ..",
    "note that in our fit we adopt the assumption made by nacre@xcite  that all rates @xmath95which obey the condition    @xmath96    can be considered negligible in practically all astrophysical applications .",
    "we assess the quality and relevance of the updated reaclib by using the following three tools :    firstly , we can ascertain that the new ( updated ) total reaclib rates approximate satisfactorily the total nacre ones by plotting their relative difference @xmath97 with respect to temperature @xmath98 :    @xmath99    secondly , we can assess the relevance of updating the reaclib rates ( i.e. the present work ) by plotting the variation of the relative difference between the old total reaclib rate and the total nacre rates , with respect to temperature @xmath98 :    @xmath100    thirdly we can assess the deviation between the new and the old reaclib rates by plotting their relative difference with respect to time .",
    "provided that the new reaclib  rates approximate well the nacre  ones this tool is also a measure of the relevance of the present update :    @xmath101    when necessary , we plot the variation of @xmath102 with respect to temperature for two different temperature regimes : the first regime is relevant to solar evolution simulations while the second one covers the entire temperature range given by nacre .    in each figure caption",
    "we also include the accuracy @xmath103 of the analytical approximation given by nacre(see appendix b of ref.@xcite ) .",
