    "several recent observational studies have found that massive , passively evolving , galaxies at @xmath8 are much more compact than local galaxies of analogous stellar mass ( ferguson et al . 2004 ; trujillo et al . 2004 , 2007 ; zirm et al . 2007 ; cimatti et al . 2008 ; damjanov et al .",
    "2008 ) . since similarly superdense massive galaxies are extremely rare or absent at @xmath9 ( shen et al .",
    "2003 ) a strong size evolution , by a factor @xmath10 or more , is indicated .",
    "no convincing mechanism able to account for such size evolution has been proposed so far . in the following",
    "we show that an expansion consistent with the observed one is naturally expected as a consequence of feedback from active nuclei ( silk & rees 1998 ; granato et al .",
    "2001 , 2004 ) , which is now widely recognized as a crucial ingredient of semi - analytic models ( see , e.g. , di matteo et al .",
    "2008 ) .    in the local universe",
    "spheroidal galaxies occupy a quite narrow region , the fundamental plane , in the 3-dimensional space identified by the effective or half - light radius @xmath11 , by the central velocity dispersion @xmath12 , and by the mean surface brightness within @xmath11 ( djorgovski & davis 1987 ) .",
    "the tight color - magnitude relation , the color - velocity dispersion relation , and spectral line indices imply that the bulk of stars of elliptical galaxies formed at @xmath13 .",
    "the enhancement of @xmath14-elements abundances with respect to iron in massive elliptical galaxies entails that most of their stars formed within the first gyr of their life ( see renzini 2006 for a comprehensive discussion ) .",
    "an additional key result is the generic presence of a super massive black hole ( smbhs ) in the center of local elliptical galaxies .",
    "its mass is directly proportional to the mass of the old stellar population , @xmath15 ( magorrian et al 1998 ; see ferrarese & ford 2005 for a review ) , implying that quasars and spheroidal galaxies form and evolve in strict relation and with mutual feedback .",
    "specifically , it has been suggested that the central smbh grows until until its feedback unbinds the residual gas in the host galaxy and sweeps it out through a high velocity wind , thus halting both the star formation and its own fueling and establishing a relationship between the smbh mass and the stellar velocity dispersion ( silk & rees 1998 ) .",
    "strong agn feedback also appears to be the only viable mechanism to explain the exponential cut - off at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function ( croton et al .",
    "2006 ) and the observed bimodality in the color - magnitude diagram of galaxies at @xmath16 ( menci et al .",
    "direct observational indications of massive outflows close to high redshift quasars , consistent with this scenario , have been reported ( e.g. simcoe et al .",
    "2006 ; prochaska & hennawy 2008 ) .    as shown below",
    ", the amount of gas rapidly stripped from the central regions of the galactic halo can be large enough to drive a large increase of the galaxy size . the puffing up of a system by rapid mass loss is a well known phenomenon , extensively studied both analytically and through numerical simulations , with reference to galaxies ( biermann & shapiro 1979 ) , and , especially , to globular clusters ( hills 1980 ; goodwin & bastian 2006 ) .",
    "slower , adiabatic expansion is caused by mass loss due to stellar winds or supernova explosions ( hills 1980 ; richstone & potter 1982 ) .    in this _",
    "we first summarize the effect of mass loss on the galaxy size evolution (  2 ) , then we present quantitative estimates on the evolution of the effective radius and of the central stellar velocity dispersion as a function of galactic mass , using the granato et al . (",
    "2004 ) model as a reference (  3 ) , and finally , in  4 , we summarize and discuss our results .",
    "the effect of the mass loss on the structure and dynamics of a virialized stellar system depends on the amount of ejected mass and on the timescale of ejection .",
    "two regimes can be identified , corresponding to an ejection timescale , @xmath17 , shorter or longer than the dynamical timescale @xmath18 .",
    "a rapid mass loss ( @xmath19 ) results in a shallower potential well at essentially constant velocity dispersion .",
    "if @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the initial and final masses , the final energy , @xmath22 , of a spherical system is related to the initial energy @xmath23 by @xmath24 ( biermann & shapiro 1979 ) , so that if @xmath25 the system has positive energy and is unbound .",
    "if @xmath26 , the system will eventually relax to a new equilibrium configuration .",
    "if the latter is homologous to the initial one , the ratio of initial ( @xmath27 ) to final ( @xmath28 ) radii is @xmath29 numerical simulations essentially confirm this simple estimate and show that , if the system is not disrupted , the new equilibrium configuration is reached after about 3040 initial dynamical times ( see , e.g. , goodwin & bastian 2006 ) .",
    "it is important to note that the above argument assumes that the system is self - gravitating and isolated .",
    "clearly the dark matter ( dm ) halo , which extends far beyond the stellar distribution , exerts a stabilizing action and prevents its disruption .",
    "if the mass loss occurs on a timescale @xmath30 , the system expands through the adiabatic invariants of the orbits of stars , and the expansion proceeds at a rate proportional to the mass loss rate ( hills , 1980 ; richstone & potter 1982 ) .",
    "we have : @xmath31 in this case no global disruption of the system is possible and the velocity is inversely proportional to the size .",
    "observations of ( sub)-millimeter bright qsos , thought to be close to the onset of the massive outflows determining the transition from the active star - forming phase to the unobscured qso phase , indicate very large gas masses in the central regions of their host galaxies ( lutz et al .",
    "2008 , and references therein ) , comparable to the stellar masses ( coppin et al .",
    ". similar star to gas ratios are found in the central regions of sub - mm bright galaxies ( tacconi et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "about 5% of the qso bolometric luminosity during the maximum quasar activity is enough to remove the gas in about one salpeter time ( @xmath32yr ) , through outflows of @xmath33 ( e.g. granato et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the high precision spectroscopy of the qso sdssj@xmath34 by prochaska & hennawi ( 2008 ) is indeed consistent with a high velocity ( @xmath35 ) , massive outflow of @xmath36 .",
    "there are thus both observational indications and theoretical arguments for the occurrence of the conditions leading to the expansion described in ",
    "[ sect : rapid ] . for sake of definiteness , we will present quantitative estimates exploiting the model by granato et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , which reproduces the crucial observational features of the coevolution of quasars and elliptical galaxies ( see lapi et al .",
    "2006 for a comprehensive discussion ) . in this model , both the star formation and the growth of the smbh proceed faster in more massive halos , in keeping with the observed `` downsizing '' . in the most massive galaxies , the quasar feedback quenches the star formation after @xmath37gyr , thus accounting for the observed @xmath14-enhancement .",
    "the star formation occurs in the inner regions of the galactic halo , encompassing a fraction @xmath38@xmath39 of the baryons associated to the halo .",
    "the star formation may be triggered and enhanced by the rapid merging of a few sub - halos .",
    "the dynamical friction is able to dissipate angular momentum of the collapsing baryons , transferring it to dm particles .",

    "its gravitational radius can be expressed as @xmath44 and the dynamical time scale of the collapsed baryon component is @xmath45 .",
    "if we adopt a srsic s ( 1968 ) law for the projected stellar density profile , the effective radius , that we identify with the projected half stellar mass radius , is related to the gravitational one by @xmath46 , and the observed luminosity weighted _ central _ velocity dispersion is related to the global density - weighted velocity dispersion by @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the srsic index ( @xmath49 for a de vaucouleurs ( 1959 ) @xmath50 law ) .",

    "if the density profile has a scale length @xmath59 , the dm velocity dispersion is @xmath60 , @xmath61 being a weak function of the concentration @xmath62 . rearranging , we obtain the dynamical time and the effective radius as a function of virial radius and mass of the host halo , and of the mass in stars and in cold gas at the onset of the mass loss : @xmath63 the model gives the mass in stars and in gas , and the mass loss for any choice of the galaxy halo mass , @xmath64 , and of the virialization redshift .",

    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma ] .",
    "simple analytical approximations for the mass in stars and cold gas as a function of halo mass and redshift were derived mao et al .",

    "the ejection of a mass @xmath81 can then produce a factor @xmath82 increase in galaxy size ( cfr .",
    "( [ eq : fast ] ) ) . on the other hand , for smaller galaxies ( @xmath83 and present day stellar mass @xmath84 )",
    "the nuclear activity is much weaker and occurs later , when the ratio @xmath85 , and hence @xmath86 , is small .",
    "this is in keeping with the general picture that the early evolution of small galaxies is ruled by sn feedback , while the evolution of the large ones is controlled by quasar feedback ( see , e.g. , shankar et al .",
    "the variation of the effective radius implies that elliptical galaxies spend the initial part of their life outside the local fundamental plane and only subsequently settle on it .    for massive galaxies ( @xmath87 ) , for which the expansion is mostly due to quasar - driven super - winds , fig .",
    "[ fig : re ] displays three steps in the evolution : _ i ) _ the end of the quasar phase at cosmic time @xmath88 , which corresponds to the end of the rapid mass loss ; _ ii ) _ the intermediate time @xmath89 when the stellar component reaches a new virial equilibrium with a larger size ; _ iii ) _ the present time @xmath90 , at which a further , minor increase of the size is achieved due to stellar winds .",
    "the initial effective radius has been computed from eq .",
    "( [ eq : re ] ) with @xmath91 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : fast ] ) shows that the size expansion can be extremely large as the fraction of expelled gas approaches 50% of the initial mass .",
    "however , at variance with the case of star clusters , confined by their own gravitation field , the presence of the dm halo , dynamically dominant at large radii , prevents the disruption and restricts the range of possible final structures of large elliptical galaxies .    the time lapse required to reach the new virial equilibrium can be inferred from numerical simulations of stellar clusters , which show that the system reaches the new equilibrium after about 40 dynamical times ( computed for the initial configuration ) , independently of the initial mass ( geyer & burkert 2001 ; goodwin & bastian 2006 ) . by scaling up this result , massive galaxies are expected to reach a new equilibrium after @xmath92gyr , at @xmath93gyr ( asterisks in fig .  [ fig : re ] ) . since then only minor adiabatic mass losses occur , producing slight changes of radius and velocity dispersion ( from asterisks to squares ) .",
    "we recall that the quasar activity statistically reaches its maximum at redshift @xmath94 , corresponding to a cosmic time @xmath95gyr .",
    "the rapid mass loss is then expected to statistically peak at the same redshift , triggering size variations that stabilize after @xmath92gyr . thus the massive galaxies should on the average reach the local size - mass relation at @xmath96gyr , corresponding to @xmath4 .",
    "this result is in keeping with sizes observed at @xmath97 ( cimatti et al .",
    "2008 ) and with results of studies of the fundamental plane at @xmath98 ( renzini 2006 ) . in the redshift interval",
    "@xmath99 a large scatter in the size  stellar mass relation is expected and indeed observed .",
    "this scenario may appear to be contradicted by observations of ferguson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who found an average size @xmath100kpc for luminous lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath101 , while we would expect @xmath102kpc , inserting the appropriate masses in eq .",
    "( [ eq : re ] ) .",
    "however as pointed out by joung , chen & bryan ( 2008 ) , the apparent effective radius could be a factor of about 3 larger than the intrinsic one , because of the presence of dust in the central star forming regions .    in the case of rapid mass loss , the velocity dispersion of the stars at virial equilibrium scales as @xmath103 .",
    "as shown by fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma ] , the size evolution illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : re ] brings the quite high velocities inferred from the observed values of @xmath104 and @xmath11 in the compact phase , to within the locally observed range .",
    "the structural evolution of low mass e galaxies follows a different path , driven by the slow mass loss due to galactic winds and supernova explosions , because their nuclear activity is of low power . adopting a chabrier ( 2005 ) initial mass function ( imf )",
    ", we find a mass loss of a factor of @xmath2 on a time scale of several gyrs ( the factor is only @xmath105 for a salpeter ( 1955 ) imf ) ; after eq .",
    "( [ eq : slow ] ) the size increases by the same factor .",
    "however most of the expansion occurs when these galaxies are young . for a chabrier imf , already half a gyr after the baryon collapse",
    "the size has increased by a factor of @xmath106 ( triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig : re ] ) and the subsequent expansion is limited to a factor of @xmath107 ( squares ) .",
    "thus such galaxies observed at ages @xmath108gyr should exhibit a size quite close to that of local spheroidal galaxies with the same stellar mass .",
    "as a consequence , high-@xmath109 galaxies with @xmath110 should also exhibit a smaller scatter in the effective radius  stellar mass relation .",
    "they are predicted to have significantly more compact sizes only at ages @xmath111gyr , when their star formation rates are of tens @xmath112/yr ( see fig .  1 of lapi et al .",
    "2006 ) , typical of relatively low luminosity , high-@xmath109 lbgs .",
    "in the adiabatic expansion case the velocity dispersion scales as @xmath113 . again",
    ", this brings the high initial velocities within the locally observed range .    as apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig : re ] , we predict significant evolution for galaxies with @xmath114 m@xmath115 , well below the threshold of @xmath116 implied by the semi - analytic model of khochfar & silk ( 2006 ) .",
    "in conclusion we suggest that the rapid mass loss driven by the quasar feedback is the main agent of the size and velocity dispersion evolution of massive spheroidal galaxies .",
    "lower - mass galaxies experience a weaker , but non negligible evolution ( of amplitude depending on the adopted imf ) , due to mass loss mainly powered by supernova explosions ; most of it occurs during their active star - formation phase . although our calculations have been carried out in the framework of the granato et al .",
    "( 2004 ) model , this evolutionary behaviour is a generic property of all models featuring large mass loss due to quasar and/or supernova feedback .",
    "observational evidences , some of which are briefly summarized in ",
    "[ sect : size ] , suggest that quasar driven high velocity outflows may have removed from the central regions of massive galaxies a gas mass comparable to the mass in stars on a timescale shorter than the dynamical time .",
    "if so , simple , model independent , physical arguments , presented in  [ sect : loss ] , imply a swelling of the stellar distribution and a decrease of the stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "the model contributes detailed , testable , predictions on the evolution of the effective radius and of the velocity dispersion as a function of the galactic age and of the halo mass .",
    "it specifically predicts different evolutionary histories for galaxies with present day stellar masses above and below @xmath117 .",
    "the energy injected by dry mergers into the stellar systems can also enlarge their size . however mergers increase the mass in stars too , and , to first order , move galaxies roughly parallel to the size - mass relation ( van dokkum et al .",
    "2008 ; damjanov et al .",
    "2008 ) , while the data show size evolution at fixed mass in stars .    the simple analysis presented in this _ letter _ is intended to be a first exploration , sketching a promising scenario for interpreting challenging observational results .",
    "this scenario can be tested , on one side , by numerical simulations with appropriate time resolution , properly taking into account the interactions between baryons and dm , and , on the other side , by observations of size and velocity dispersion especially of lower mass high-@xmath109 galaxies , that are expected to show an evolutionary behaviour different from that of massive galaxies because of the different mass loss history ."
