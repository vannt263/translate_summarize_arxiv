    "this series of papers on spectral irradiance calibration in the infrared ( ir ) was motivated by the need to establish accurate celestial flux standards for use in astronomical spectroscopy and photometry by spaceborne , airborne and ground - based instruments .",
    "the earlier papers in this series present the foundations of a method for establishing an entire all - sky network of ir flux calibrators .",
    "the nir to mir imager on nasa s space infrared telescope facility ( sirtf ) - the infrared array camera ( irac ) - has four detector arrays , with central wavelengths of 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0  @xmath1 m .",
    "the irac detectors are roughly 2000 times more sensitive than those of iras and would saturate on all but the faintest stars of the existing network . in the current paper",
    ", we develop the methodology to predict the ir in - band fluxes of fainter stars using optical photometry , and we report the results of an experiment to demonstrate the reliability of this method . consequently , this paper describes the approach we are pursuing to create the on - orbit cool giant and hot dwarf calibrators for irac , and will serve as a proof - of - concept by validating the efficacy of the method .",
    "the objectives of the current paper were to : select a mix of cool giants and a - dwarfs with well - characterized , precision optical photometry ; determine accurate optical spectral types for all these stars ; represent their energy distributions by appropriately reddened stellar photospheric spectra ; normalize these energy distributions using the optical bands ; predict @xmath2 from the normalized spectra ; secure characterized @xmath2 observations of as many of these stars as possible ; compare observed and predicted nir magnitudes ; and create a set of absolute spectra for stars considerably fainter than those of our previous all - sky network .",
    "the final products to be generated by this effort will likewise be complete , continuous , absolutely calibrated spectra from the uv to mir , consistent with the context described by cohen et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    " 2 overviews the basic components of our methodology , treating : the construction of combined optical  ir  supertemplates \" of cool , normal giant stars , which extend from 0.115 to 35  @xmath1 m ; the optical  ir atmospheric models and their synthetic spectra for the hot a - dwarfs ; and the reddening corrections applied to the selected stars .",
    " 3 follows with a demonstration of the method using a set of selected landolt and carter - meadows standards with published , precision @xmath0 magnitudes , for which we secured our own optical classification spectroscopy , and applies the technique to the prediction of nir and mir magnitudes from optical photometry and spectra .",
    " 4 describes the results of renormalizing these supertemplate and model spectra using all available optical , nir , and mir photometry , and describes how to obtain these spectra . ",
    "5 sets our work in context with 2mass and sirtf , showing how this method will be used to estimate the in - band fluxes of our potential calibrators in the four irac bands and assessing the degree to which this approach will satisfy the absolute calibration goals for irac . in an appendix",
    ", we detail the extension of the method to accommodate space - based optical data from hipparcos / tycho , and we focus on the problems encountered with tycho-1 photometry of cool stars , which are largely mitigated by tycho-2 data .",
    "the method extends previously created , empirical , absolutely calibrated , 1.235  @xmath1 m composite spectra (  templates \" ) of bright stars with spectral types of k0iii to m0iii , into the uv and optical .",
    "these optical - to - infrared  supertemplates \" are used as generic spectral shapes for all stars of a given spectral type and luminosity class .",
    "the supertemplates , after they have been reddened using a standard extinction law and normalized to broadband optical and nir / mir photometric measurements , serve as proxy spectra for a network of stars which are too faint or too numerous to be effectively measured individually .",
    "the current network of 422 stars was constructed by fitting 1.235  @xmath1 m templates to photometry from ground - based and spaceborne telescopes ( cohen et al .",
    "the fundamental reference standards for the spectra are absolutely calibrated models of the a - type stars sirius and vega .",
    "the templates were constructed by combining empirical spectral fragments for eight bright k / m - giants obtained from ground  based , airborne and spaceborne telescopes .",
    "the absolute calibration of these spectra was determined by taking the ratios of the cool stars spectra to the observed spectrum of either vega ( below 13@xmath1 m ) or sirius , and then scaling the ratioed spectra by the theoretical a - star spectra , degraded to the actual spectral resolution of the observations .",
    "the range of fluxes in the network of 422 templates decreases from 800 to 5 jy in the iras 12-@xmath1 m band , with a handful of stars as faint as 1.1 jy in a new , unpublished set of 602 templates by walker & cohen ( 2002 ) which includes the 422 stars of paper x , sometimes with updated versions of their spectra .",
    "the msx satellite has recently provided a validation of the relative and absolute calibration of subsets of the stars that compose this network .",
    "cohen et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have analyzed independently calibrated msx photometry in six bands from 4.3 to 21.3  @xmath1 m from all three tiers of the network - vega / sirius , the bright k-/m - giants , and the fainter template stars - and find the msx data agree with the predicted fluxes to within the estimated uncertainties .",
    "to provide meaningful calibrators for irac s four bands requires flux densities from about 1 jy down to about 1 mjy in these bands .",
    "however , we wish to maintain traceability to our absolute spectral products that support the infrared telescope in space ( murakami et al . 1996 ) , the diffuse infrared background explorer ( hauser et al . 1998 , their table  1 ; cohen 1998 ) , the midcourse space experiment ( price et al . 2001 ; egan et al .",
    "1999 ; mill et al .",
    "1994 ) and esa s infrared space observatory ( kessler et al .",
    "1996 ) instruments . to extend k0m0iiis from 12-@xmath1 m flux densities of 5 jy down to the requisite values for irac necessitates using stars that are fainter by about 9 mag than those of the current network , at the level of v@xmath31112 .",
    "one way to achieve even fainter ir flux densities , for stars with the same visual magnitudes as the current network , is to use hot stars , for which kurucz model atmospheres are quite reliable in the optical and ir .",
    "the original set of spectral types for which cohen et al .",
    "( 1995,1996a , b ) have constructed complete , empirical 1.235  @xmath1 m spectra consists of : k0 , k1.5 , k3 , k5 , m0 , m1.5 , m2.5 , and m3.4iii . to minimize any potential variability we have concentrated solely on the range k0-m0iii for irac calibrators . to create a finer grid of templates , we have interpolated these spectra to create new ir templates for types k1 , k2 , k4 , and k7iii .",
    "the interpolation of a template file , with its five elements ( @xmath4 , f@xmath5 , absolute error in f@xmath5 , local , and global biases : see paper x ) first requires removal of the global and local biases from the total uncertainty , leaving the solely random component of the uncertainty .",
    "two templates whose spectral types flank that of the required type are normalized in @xmath6f@xmath5 space so that they lie on top of one another longward of the sio fundamental . the flux density , random error , local bias and global bias are linearly interpolated using the _ s _ parameter of de jager & nieuwenhuijzen ( 1987 ) , which represents spectral type more continously and linearly than either stellar effective temperature or its logarithm for normal , mature stars .",
    "finally , the local and global biases are recombined in quadrature with the random errors , yielding the quantities for a new template file .",
    "this procedure provides a more complete set of template spectra to apply to new candidate calibrators , and a set that it is fully consistent with our published , complete , empirical spectra of bright k-/m - giants .",
    "figure  [ k4 g ] illustrates the newly created k4iii template derived by interpolation between k3iii ( @xmath7 hya ) and k5iii ( @xmath7 tau ) templates .    to establish the credibility of such interpolated products , we compare the k4iii template with consistently calibrated spectral observations of @xmath8 umi ( k4iii ) taken on the kuiper airborne observatory ( kao ) using the hifogs instrument ( witteborn et al .",
    "1995 ) and by the iras low resolution spectrometer ( lrs ) . both hifogs ( cohen et al .",
    "1995 ) and the lrs ( cohen et al .",
    "1992a ) have been calibrated in the identical context to that of paper x. @xmath8 umi was observed on the kao flights of 14 and 19 april 1995 , and calibrated using identically taken hifogs spectra of @xmath7 boo , matching the airmass of @xmath8 umi as closely as possible . figure  [ kaocfn ] illustrates this direct comparison .",
    "note that the two spectrometers have very different resolving powers , of order 200 for hifogs ( 4.99.6  @xmath1 m ) and 20 - 50 for the lrs ( 7.722.7  @xmath1 m ) .",
    "this accounts for the divergence , for 7.78.5  @xmath1 m , between the filled ( kao ) and open ( lrs ) squares in the deep sio fundamental absorption . with these exceptions ,",
    "there is satisfactory overlap at the 1 - 2@xmath9 level between observations and the k4iii template , corresponding to agreement within 5% ( except in the saturated ozone feature @xmath10 m in the kao spectrum ) .    to construct combined optical - to - ir  supertemplates \" , it is necessary to extend the standard 1.235  @xmath1 m calibrated spectra into the optical .",
    "this step was accomplished by splicing the ir templates to the average of the several spectra for stars with relevant mk spectral types from pickles s ( 1998 ) spectral library that extends from the far - ultraviolet ( 1150 ) to the nir ( 2.5  @xmath1 m ) . in some cases , it was necessary to fill in `` gaps '' in the pickles `` uvklib '' spectra of the cool giants and to rectify erroneous blackbody - based interpolations by using our own fully - observed spectra longward of 1.22  @xmath1 m .",
    "when the final products were deemed complete , accurate , and without discontinuities , the observed @xmath11 colors for these supertemplates were synthesized and compared with the literature to check that they satisfactorily represented reddening - free spectral shapes , within the respective uncertainties .",
    "figure  [ ste ] presents the k5iii supertemplate from 0.2735  @xmath1 m .",
    "supertemplates formally extend down to 0.115  @xmath1 m but cool giants rarely are well - detected by iue below 0.27  @xmath1 m , so we offer them only longward of 0.275  @xmath1 m , for practical purposes .",
    "each pickles spectrum was itself constructed as the average of spectra from up to 17 other libraries , suggesting probable robustness as a representative for each type .",
    "although we created a k7iii template , we recognize that these are rather rarely encountered and , further , pickles ( 1998 ) does not include this type in his spectral library .",
    "therefore , we simply averaged his spectra for k5iii and m0iii , and appended that to our interpolated k7iii ir template .",
    "implicit in these constructs is the assumption that whatever the actual metallicity and , more importantly , the abundances of c , o , and si are for any individual star , we can apply a generic spectral shape whose heritage is partly traceable to the bright stars observed spectroscopically from the kao , from the ground , and from space ( using the lrs ) .",
    "the reason for this assumption is that this same technique will be applied to visually very faint stars for which it is most unlikely that such detailed information will be available .",
    "the a - dwarf synthetic spectra were all taken from the standard , solar - abundance grid of kurucz lte model atmospheres ( kurucz 1993 ) , and correspond to stars of effective temperature , 9795 , 9397 , 9016 , 8710 , 8433 , 8185k , for the set a0v to a5v , respectively ( de jager & nieuwenhuijzen 1987 ) , and gravity , log(g ) , between 4.16 and 4.25 ( varying monotonically with type ) .",
    "analysis of both empirical ir spectra and theoretical models indicates that effective temperature exerts the dominant influence on the shapes of these spectra , with gravity , and especially metallicity , much less significant .",
    "tests carried out on kurucz models ( for hot , warm , and even cool stars ) during the calibration work in support of iso showed that differences arose between ir templates and models , even when the literature provided explicit estimates of temperature , gravity and [ fe / h ] . however , empirical and model spectra were generally in good agreement , within @xmath122% in the ir continuum , and @xmath135% in molecular bands ( e.g. the co first overtone bands )",
    ". further , those differences that do arise were not dependent on [ fe / h ] but rather on a star s individual abundances of c , o , and si .",
    "such data are not generally available for faint stars , even when an estimate of [ fe / h ] might exist .",
    "another way of validating this entire process derives from the direct comparison of observed stellar angular diameters and  radiometric \" diameters ( cohen et al . 1999 ) .",
    "there is excellent agreement between measured and radiometrically predicted stellar angular diameters , with the implication that continua and even molecular band shapes and depths are well - matched at least to first order .",
    "this result also lends validity to the supertemplates .",
    "stellar reddening was determined by comparing landolt s ( 1992 ) measured @xmath11 ( or , equivalently , the same indices measured by carter & meadows ( 1995 ) ) with the mean intrinsic colors described below .",
    "if a star proved too blue for its type , we assigned zero to a@xmath14 , otherwise we assigned 3.10@xmath15 .",
    "the resulting extinctions were applied to the intrinsic supertemplates .",
    "the natural spread of observed @xmath11 indices for unreddened stars of any given spectral type is quite substantial , attaining about @xmath120.15 ( mermilliod 1993 ) .",
    "we attribute this to intrinsic cosmic scatter among the stars , caused by : variations in metallicity ; the individual abundances of elements - primarily c , o and si - whose lines and bands significantly sculpt the stellar energy distribution and are not governed solely by temperature and gravity ; the quantization of a continuum of stellar temperatures and gravities into discrete spectral classes ; and errors in the assignment of spectral types drawn from the literature .",
    "it is for this latter reason that we have mounted our own optical spectroscopy program ( see  3.4 ) .    to exact",
    "the greatest precision from our technique requires the best estimates for the mean color indices of k0m0iii and a05v stars because optically faint ( hence ir - faint ) stars of both these types are likely to be significantly reddened . for these estimates we chose to rely on the hipparcos output data base ( van leeuwen 1997 ) .",
    "individual records offer the hipparcos team s best value of @xmath11 color , along with kinematic and parallax data , spectral types , and a host of information so that one can readily reject multiple and variable stars , and objects with poorly determined parallaxes .",
    "the catalog enables the determination of observed colors from subsets with as many as 50200 stars for each populous type of k - giant , and at least 50 a - dwarfs per subclass , even when demanding meaningful measurements of parallax ( hence distance ) at the 510@xmath9 level .",
    "we converted observed @xmath16 and @xmath17 magnitudes to absolute @xmath18 and @xmath19 and into estimates of each star s intrinsic @xmath11 . if a star s distance , calculated from the reciprocal of a significant parallax , placed it within the dust - free local bubble ( fitzgerald 1970 ; perry & johnston 1982 ; perry et al . 1982 ) then we assigned zero extinction on the basis of the extent of the dust - free zone . for stars beyond 75 pc",
    ", we assigned an a@xmath14 of 0.625 mag kpc@xmath20 ( and a@xmath21/a@xmath14=1.299 ) to determine the absolute magnitudes and intrinsic @xmath11 .",
    "the values used for the extinction per kpc , and for the ratio a@xmath21/a@xmath14 , come from the reddening law described below . because we test each parallax - based distance against a simplistic representation of the local bubble , then average the resulting extinctions ( many of which are zero ) , any residual effects of lutz - kelker bias are greatly diluted .",
    "the representation of the actual law of extinction that we used between fuv and mir was based on the 7th - order polynomial fits suggested by cardelli , clayton & mathis ( 1989 ) for the ultraviolet and far - ultraviolet , the 8th - order polynomial fits of odonnell ( 1994 ) for the optical - to - nir range , and joins smoothly onto the law of reddening used by cohen ( 1993 ) longward of 4.7  @xmath1 m .",
    "we note that there are few substantive differences at short wavelengths ( @xmath22 m ) between different , empirically - derived , reddening laws in the literature .",
    "this overall law compares favorably , for example , with the representations of other authors , such as fluks et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , whose ir reddening law is actually derived from theoretical considerations .",
    "we have likewise compared our reddening curve with that described by fitzpatrick ( 1999 ) , finding excellent accord except in the vicinity of the @xmath23 band ( see fitzpatrick s discussion of this region ) and , of course , throughout the interstellar silicate absorptions that are absent from his representation of the ir extinction curve .",
    "however , fitzpatrick s ( 1999 ) quantification of the uncertainties in uv - optical extinction curves is particularly valuable . to estimate uncertainties in the nir and mir , we first compared the law described above with the independently derived law of rieke & lebofsky ( 1985 ) . following their adoption of uncertainties of @xmath315% in a@xmath5/a@xmath14 , we find that the differences between our values and those of the 21 rieke - lebofsky points lie well within 1@xmath9 ( combined ) for 18 wavelengths .",
    "only one point ( at 13  @xmath1 m ) lies more than 2.5@xmath9 away .",
    "these quantitative uncertainties in our reddening curve are now accommodated in the code that generated the actual spectra of the landolt and carter - meadows stars in this paper , and will likewise be used to create spectra of the sirtf calibrators .",
    "we now offer a demonstration of our methodology using a set of selected optical standard stars with published , precision @xmath0 magnitudes , and for which we have undertaken an optical spectroscopy program at mt .",
    "hopkins observatory ( mho ) to establish their spectral types .",
    "hopkins spectral types and extinctions based on the observed @xmath11 are used to appropriately redden the supertemplates or kurucz synthetic spectra to represent each selected star s energy distribution .",
    "these shapes are then normalized by @xmath0 photometry and the resulting spectra used to predict ir @xmath2 magnitudes . direct comparison between well - characterized nir photometry and these predictions tests the efficacy of our approach .",
    "we now describe our chosen stars which were drawn from two different sets , with their own independent optical and nir photometry , and discuss the sources of their spectral types .",
    "we offer cross - checks on two independent @xmath0 data sets ; compare space - based and ground - based optical normalizations of supertemplates ; and demonstrate consistent predictions of different systems of @xmath2 for one star common to the two data sets .",
    "our primary optical data set is the precision @xmath0 photometry on stars in the kapteyn selected areas offered by landolt ( 1973,1983,1992 ) .",
    "these furnish an abundant set of faint , optical standards measured through well - documented passbands .",
    "only about 600 of the many stars observed by landolt had ever been classified spectroscopically , by drilling & landolt ( 1979 ) . of these , only about 30 were suggested to be k0m0 giants .",
    "early experiments with the technique described in this paper indicated that some of these types were surely suspect by several subclasses .",
    "consequently , we selected 32 alleged cool giants and about an equal number of stars lying within 10@xmath24 of the ecliptic plane , whose @xmath11 colors suggested that they might be k0-m0iiis , for a program of optical classification spectroscopy . in total we investigated 62 landolt stars",
    ".    another valuable set of test objects is the collection of stars offered by carter & meadows ( 1995 ) as faint standards for 34 m class ground - based telescopes .",
    "carter & meadows ( 1995 ) also provide their own @xmath0 measurements from the saao 0.5-m telescope at sutherland . to test the a - stars",
    ", we decided to apply our method to _ all _ stars for which carter & meadows cite a spectral type between  a0 \" and  a5 \" , even when a luminosity class is lacking .",
    "we had hoped to demonstrate the plausibility of assigning dwarf luminosities to these stars on the basis of a successful prediction of their nir magnitudes .",
    "this gave us an additional 19 stars to investigate .",
    "we have augmented the landolt sample of cool giants for which we obtained mt .",
    "hopkins spectra by sa94 - 251 , sa108 - 475 , and hd197806 ( whose type of k0iii , cited by carter & meadows , is vindicated by houk & swift ( 1999 ) ) .",
    "we found a final subset of 24 cool giants stars to be useful : i.e. their actual spectral types fell into our desired spectral ranges ; we were able to secure precision nir photometry from tenerife or from carter & meadows ; and we could accurately predict their @xmath2 magnitudes .",
    "these 24 stars appear in table  [ coords ] .",
    "the other landolt stars were  lost \" either because we found them to be k- or m - dwarfs , or because we were unable to secure tenerife @xmath2 data for them .",
    "[ coords ]    we extracted the most accurate coordinates that could be found either in simbad (  s \" ) or in the guide star catalog gsc1.3 with corrections from act (  g \" ) for these stars .",
    "searching simbad by any of a host of possible star names is not equivalent to searching by coordinates , as dr .",
    "david shupe , who kindly extracted these coordinates for our first observing run , noted for sa114 - 670 .",
    "the simbad position returned by this name is considerably in error compared with the true coordinates that correctly return the star under the name ppm 700910 .",
    "table  [ coords ] summarizes accurate coordinates , with landolt or carter - meadows @xmath16 and @xmath17 magnitudes .",
    "carter & meadows provide rough j2000 positions of their stars ; but their a - dwarfs are all hd stars and precise coordinates are available unambiguously in the literature .",
    "arlo landolt kindly provided digitized versions of the tables from his 1992 paper in which are given details of the ctio @xmath0 passbands used for his photometry of optical standard stars , along with the response curve of the photomultipliers .",
    "we further multiplied the product of each passband and the detector response curve by a mean atmospheric transmission spectrum appropriate to cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) in chile . to represent the intervening telluric transmissions above ctio",
    ", we represented the atmospheric transmission using plexus , an afrl validated  expert system \" that incorporates atmospheric code , specifically modtran 3.7 , samm , and fascode3p with the hitran98 archives .",
    "plexus contains an extensive database to support its expert aspect , so that the effects of rayleigh scattering , aerosols , and particulates appropriate to the desert conditions of the ctio sites were included .",
    "paper x also used plexus calculations to represent the site - specific atmospheric transmissions necessary to represent the tens of ground - based filters characterized in that work so we have maintained consistency in our treatment of all systems , both optical and ir .",
    "we did compare the ctio atmospheric transmission from plexus with the simpler formulation for extinction given by hayes & latham ( 1975 ) , based explicitly on the effects of rayleigh scattering , absorption by ozone , and scattering by aerosols , and we found good accord .",
    "we created @xmath0 relative spectral response curves ( hereafter rsrs ) from the combinations of filter , atmosphere , and detector profiles that were normalized to peak values of unity .",
    "there have been several comparisons of the saao @xmath0 system with johnson s @xmath0 ( cousins 1984 ; bessell 1979 ) , ctio @xmath25 ( menzies 1989 ) , and a wider ranging discussion is given by straizys ( 1992 ) .",
    "menzies ( 1989 ) found slight differences between the cousins @xmath26 passbands and those of landolt , while menzies et al .",
    "( 1991 ) concluded that the saao and landolt ctio @xmath27 bands differ from one another and probably also from johnson s .",
    "we have attempted to pursue the actual bands in use at saao by way of the detailed response functions offered by straizys ( 1992 : who also cites bessell 1979,1983 ) , but this has proved unsatisfactory .",
    "we further note the following statement by menzies ( 1989 ) :  the photometer on the 0.5-m telescope in sutherland is in continuous use so there has not been an opportunity to determine the filter transmission functions experimentally . \"",
    "consequently , we have represented the carter - meadows relative response curves ( filter - plus - atmosphere - plus - detector ) in @xmath0 by the same response curves as those published by landolt ( 1992 ) .",
    "direct comparison of @xmath0 for objects in common to the carter - meadows and landolt samples justifies this step , as exemplified by sa94 - 251 and sa108 - 475 ( table  [ cfns ] ) . for the former ,",
    "the differences between magnitudes measured in both systems are within the assigned 3@xmath9 uncertainties ; for the latter , all differences are within the 1@xmath9 uncertainties .",
    "menzies et al .",
    "( 1991 ) based their conclusions on a set of 212 landolt stars for which they present saao @xmath0 measurements .",
    "these stars span a wide range of spectral types .",
    "we have carried out the same experiment , but restricted to 21 landolt stars in common , for which our mt .",
    "hopkins spectra indicate k0-m0iii spectral types .",
    "the result of comparing landolt - minus - saao magnitudes , using inverse - variance weighting for the combinations , show , for @xmath0 respectively : -0.002@xmath120.022 ; -0.012@xmath120.011 ; -0.005@xmath120.007 ; -0.011@xmath120.009 ; and -0.011@xmath120.010 . on the basis of this restricted range of spectral types relevant to our needs ,",
    "we conclude that there are no significant differences between landolt and saao photometry .",
    "this conclusion also enables us to utilize the data in table 1 of menzies et al .",
    "( 1991 ) with our subset of landolt stars . for simplicity , when we later refer to `` landolt '' of ",

    "[ cfns ]    all five system response curves were then integrated over our standard , calibrated , kurucz model spectrum of vega ( cohen et al . 1992b ) to provide their  zero magnitude attributes \" .",
    "these attributes ( table  [ gndcal ] ) include the in - band flux ( irradiance ) and its uncertainty , and the monochromatic specific intensity ( e.g. f@xmath5 ) , as well as the isophotal wavelength for vega of each filter . for convenience",
    "we have also incorporated f@xmath29 , the monochromatic specific intensity in frequency terms , in units of janskys ( jy ) .",
    "note that the isophotal f@xmath29 can not be accurately rendered simply as @xmath4@xmath30[@xmath1m]@xmath31  @xmath32  f@xmath5[w @xmath33 @xmath1m@xmath20]/3@xmath3210@xmath35 because of the finite bandwidths of these filters .",
    "we have recast each rsr in frequency terms , and have performed the identical integrals for in - band , bandwidth , and f@xmath29 as we carried out for f@xmath5 .",
    "the electronic version of table  [ gndcal ] offers these combined rsrs by clicking on the links in the  filter \" column .",
    "while cohen and colleagues ( e.g. paper x ) have always defined zero magnitude in the infrared by this kurucz spectrum of vega , this star does not have zero magnitudes in the optical .",

    "therefore , we derived the true zero magnitude irradiance and isophotal f@xmath5 values from those of our vega spectrum , brightening the vega values accordingly .",
    "table  [ gndcal ] lists the resulting zero magnitude attributes for the five bands consistent with our previously published absolute calibrations in the optical and ir .",

    "details of the ecliptic pole and plane stars actually selected to support irac , and the derivation of their absolute spectra , will appear in a later paper in this series .    from the supertemplates , one can derive the expected attributes of the stars within any user - specified set of passbands accommodated by the range of our spectra , given the system s relative spectral response curves , and one can utilize the absolute spectra directly to support the calibration of low - resolution ( resolving power @xmath3100 ) spectrometers , exactly as for the 422 absolute template spectra published by cohen et al .",

    "we note that @xmath50 is strongly concentrated to the region around 4000  where cool giant spectra are falling very steeply , below the ca h and k break , rendering these stars particularly faint in @xmath50 .    therefore , we decided to investigate possible nonlinearities in the @xmath50 scale at faint levels by plotting the ratios of @xmath28 scale factors to those from the three space - based bands against hipparcos - tycho magnitude , for all our landolt cool giants and our carter - meadows a - dwarfs .",

    "table  [ htbias ] presents the slopes of the regression lines of scale - ratio against space - based magnitude .",
    "the concurrence of these three ways of examining the data on normalization ratios points to the conclusion that , for the faintest cool giants , one should not rely on the normalization factor derived directly from the @xmath50 band .",
    "if a faint cool giant has @xmath28 and space - based data , then the influence of @xmath50 on the overall scale factor will be limited because the associated uncertainty in a faint @xmath50 magnitude will be large enough that the weight accorded to @xmath50 s contribution under inverse - variance weighting will be correspondingly small . if a cool giant lacks any @xmath53 photometry , but hipparcos - tycho measurements exist , one could in principle ignore @xmath50 s scale factor . however , this could reduce the number of optical normalizing wavelengths to only a single , @xmath51 , point or at best , two points , if @xmath52 is also available . to handle such situations",
    "we suggest that it is important to use the regression line to increase the @xmath50 scale factor , in accord with this line , so that it would mimic the scale that would have been obtained using @xmath28 observations .",
    "the fact that a - dwarfs exhibit no such anomalies even in this bluest hipparcos - tycho band argues for the effect to arise from the extremely different energy distributions of the k-/m - giants , whose faintest optical region lies within @xmath50 , and the a - stars , which are brightest in the blue . a simple test of this conjecture would be to seek a dependence of the @xmath50 scale factor on spectral type .",

    "for 12 cool giants with both tycho-1 and tycho-2 photometry we have investigated the effects of making this change on the ratios of @xmath28-determined scale factors to those from tycho alone . in @xmath50 , these ratios are worse ( i.e. larger ) with tycho-2 than with tycho-1 for 3 stars , unchanged for 2 stars , but better for 7 . in @xmath51 , where the effects are much smaller in magnitude , the ratios are worse for 2 stars , unchanged for 5 , and better for 5 .",
    "the regression analysis for tycho-2 b@xmath54 magnitudes between ratios of scale factors and k spectral class appears in figure  [ bt2kgt ] along with the formal best fit regression line .",
    "for tycho-2 there is still a significant offset ( 1.12@xmath120.02 ) but the formal value for the slope is insignificantly different from unity ( 0.01@xmath120.01 ) .",
    "therefore , we consider it appropriate to rescale _ all _ k- and m - giant scale factors derived from tycho-2 b@xmath54 data by @xmath321.14@xmath120.01 ( corresponding to the inverse - variance weighted average of the 12 k - giants factors ) , thereby bringing them into alignment with @xmath55 normalization multipliers when we create absolute supertemplates . for those cool giants with tycho-1 data but lacking tycho-2 data ( one star in our sample ) , we use the regression line in figure  [ bt1kgt ] to correct b@xmath54 scale factors for tycho-1 photometry of k-/m - giants .    advanced methods of data reduction , not available at the time tycho-1 was processed , were applied to the tycho-2 catalog ( hg et al .",
    "2000 ) , for example , all data series for a given star throughout the entire mission were coadded with appropriate weighting prior to deriving photometry from the accumulated signal . for low signal - to - noise signals in the tycho star - mappers ,",
    "the gain in tycho-2 was substantial , compared with tycho-1 .",
    "known inherent biases in tycho-1 are highlighted by hg et al .",
    "single transits of a star over the star - mappers in which no obvious peak was identifiable were neglected in tycho-1 , leading to preferential selection of brighter transits of the same star (  4.1 of hg et al .",
    "second , in the presence of a changing background , the much longer series of sky samples used in tycho-1 can lead to systematic offsets in the assessed background level (  4.2 of hg et al .",
    "2000 ) . both @xmath51 and @xmath52 sample these cool stellar energy distributions well past the 4000  break , where their spectra rise rapidly into the red",
    ", so there are no corresponding problems with cool stars in @xmath51 or @xmath52 .",
    "we suggest that the phenomenon we see is due to the already known biases in tycho-1 but , at least partly , to malmquist bias whereby the detection of faint red stars in b@xmath54 and , to a lesser extent in @xmath51 , is enhanced by upward noise fluctuations and this problem systematically worsens with later - type cool giants .",
    "therefore , the k-/m - giants appear brighter than reality , leading to smaller scale factors as stars become fainter and cooler .",
    "the improvements in processing of tycho-2 alleviate this problem , and avoid the known problem of the ",
    "dramatic \"  faint end bias \" intrinsic to tycho-1 (  7.1 of hg et al .",

    "<S> we describe the technique that will be used to develop a set of on - orbit calibrators for irac and demonstrate the validity of the method for stars with spectral types either k0-m0iii or a0-a5v . for application to sirtf </S>",
    "<S> , the approach is intended to operate with all available optical , near - infrared ( nir ) , and mid - infrared ( mir ) photometry , and to yield complete absolute spectra from uv to mir . </S>",
    "<S> one set of stars is picked from landolt s extensive network of optical ( @xmath0 ) calibrators ; the other from the carter - meadows set of faint infrared standards . </S>",
    "<S> traceability to the  cohen - walker - witteborn \" framework of absolute photometry and stellar spectra is assured ( cohen , walker , & witteborn 1992a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the method is based on the use of either  supertemplates \" , that represent the intrinsic shapes of the spectra of k0m0iii stars from far - ultraviolet ( 1150 ) to mir ( 35  @xmath1 m ) wavelengths , or kurucz synthetic spectra for a0 - 5v stars . </S>",
    "<S> each supertemplate or kurucz model is reddened according to the individual star s extinction and is normalized using available characterized optical photometry . </S>",
    "<S> this paper tests our capability to predict nir ( @xmath2 ) magnitudes using supertemplates or models constrained by hipparcos / tycho or precision ground - based optical data . </S>",
    "<S> we provide absolutely calibrated 0.27535.00  @xmath1 m spectra of thirty three landolt or carter - meadows optical standard stars to demonstrate the viability of this technique , and to offer a set of ir calibrators 100 - 1000 times fainter than those we have previously published . as an indication of what we can expect for actual irac calibration stars </S>",
    "<S> , we have calculated the absolute uncertainties associated with predicting the irac magnitudes for the faintest cool giant and hot dwarf in this new set of calibration stars . </S>"
