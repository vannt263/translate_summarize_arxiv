    "in orthogonal frequency - division multiple access ( ofdma ) multi - cell networks , the main factor that has a direct impact on the system performance is intercell interference ( ici ) which is caused by the use of the same frequency resource in adjacent cells at the same time .",
    "intercell interference coordiantion ( icic ) techniques have been introduced as an effective technique that can significantly mitigate the ici and improve users performance , especially for users experiencing low signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) .",
    "the two dimensional ( 2-d ) traditional hexagonal network model with deterministic bs locations is the most popular model that is used to analyze a cellular network . in this model , a service area is divided into several hexagonal cells with _",
    "same _ radius and each cell is served by a bs which is often located at the center of the cell .",
    "tractable analysis was often achieved for a fixed user with limited number of interfering bss or in case of ignoring propagation pathloss @xcite .",
    "another tractable and simple model is the wyner model @xcite which was developed by information theorists and has been widely used to evaluate the performance of cellular networks in both uplink and downlink directions . in wyner and its modified models ,",
    "users were assumed to have fixed locations and interference intensity was assumed to be deterministic and homogeneous .",
    "however , for a real wireless network , it is clear that users locations may be fixed sometimes , but interference levels vary moderately depending on several factors such as receiver and transmitter locations , transmission conditions , and the number of instantaneous interfering bss . hence , these models are no longer accurate to evaluate the performance of multi - cell wireless networks , thus the ppp network model has been proposed and developed as the accurate and flexible tractable model for cellular networks @xcite .    in ppp model , the service area is partitioned into non - overlapping voronoi cells @xcite in which the number of cells is a random poisson variable .",
    "each cell is served by a unique bs that is located at its nucleus .",
    "users are distributed as some stationary point process and allowed to connect with the strongest or the closest bss . in the strongest model , each user measures sinr from several candidate bss and",
    "selects the bs with the highest sinr . in the closest model , the distances between the user and bss are estimated , and the bs which is nearest to the user is selected . in this work , we assume that each user associates with the nearest bs",
    ".    the ppp network performance can be evaluated by coverage probability approach @xcite and moment generating function ( mgf ) approach @xcite .",
    "coverage probability approach was proposed to calculate the coverage probability and capacity of a typical user that associates with its nearest base station @xcite , and then extended for ppp network enabling frequency reuse @xcite . in these work , the closed - form expressions were evaluated by ignoring gaussian noise and only in rayleigh fading . the closed - form expression for coverage probability is yet to be investigated and developed for a composite rayleigh - lognormal fading channel .",
    "mgf approach was proposed in @xcite to avoid the complexity of coverage probability approach . by using this approach",
    ", the authors derived the average capacity of a user in a simple ppp network with generalized fading channels .",
    "the final equations , however , were not simple because they contained the gauss hypergeometric function @xcite which is expressed as an integral .",
    "some work that evaluated the effects of rayleigh and shadowing were considered in @xcite . however , in @xcite , shadowing was not incorporated in channel gain and assumed to be constant when the origin ppp model is rescaled .",
    "instead of rescaling the network model , authors in @xcite introduced a new approach to derive the mathematical expression for coverage probability for ppp network neglecting noise .    in most of papers , it was assumed that each cell had either a user or a single rb , and all bss have same power and transmit continuously .",
    "these assumptions led to the fact that the neighbouring bss always created ici to a typical user .",
    "hence , the impacts of scheduling algorithms such as round robin on network performance were not clearly presented .",
    "furthermore , in all papers that discussed above , the expressions of coverage probability were only presented in the close - form expression in the case of high snr or neglecting gaussian noise , otherwise they were presented with two layer integrals which could not be evaluated .    in this paper",
    ", it is assumed that each bs is allocated @xmath0 rbs to serve @xmath1 users and has different transmission power .",
    "these assumptions are relevant to the practical network because in cellular networks , the transmission powers of bss in different tiers such as macro , pico and fermto , are significantly different .",
    "even , the transmission powers of bss in a given tier still vary and depend on the location or transmission condition . the closed - form expression for coverage probability of a typical user in the closest ppp network model",
    "is derived by using coverage probability approach and gauss - legendre approximation .",
    "a simple part of this paper was presented in @xcite with assumptions that there is only a rb and a user in the network and all bss have same transmission power .",
    "furthermore , in this paper , the variance of simulation results is presented to confirm the stable and accuracy of simulation programs .",
    "homogeneous poisson model of wireless network is the simplest ppp model with a single hierarchical level . in this model ,",
    "the service area is partitioned into non - overlapping voronoi cells @xcite in which the number of cells is a random poisson variable .",
    "each cell is served by a unique bs that is located at its nucleus ( see figure [ fig : pppnetwork ] ) .",
    "users are distributed as some stationary point process and allowed to connect with the closest bss .     and",
    "@xmath6,width=340,height=245 ]    in the nearest model , an importance parameter @xmath7 is defined as the distance from a typical user to its associated bs . since",
    "each user connects with the closest bs , all neighboring bss must be further than @xmath7 .",
    "the null probability of a 2-d poisson process with density @xmath8 in a globular area with radius @xmath9 is @xmath10 , then the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of @xmath7 is given by @xcite : .",
    "@xmath11 the pdf can be obtained by finding the derivative of the cdf : @xmath12    in figure [ fig : pppnetwork ] , a 6 km x 6 km service area is considered where the distribution of bss is a poisson spatial process with density @xmath13 .",
    "it can observed that the boundaries of the cell as well as the locations of bss in this model are generated randomly to correspond with the changes of network operations .",
    "the main weakness of this model is that sometimes bss are located very close together , but this can be overcome by taking the average from multiple results of network performance .    in this paper",

    "this indicator function takes values 1 if the base station in cell @xmath15 and @xmath16 transmit on the same rb at the same time .",
    "when the round robin scheduling is deployed , the expected values of @xmath14 is archived by : @xmath17      in downlink cellular network , the transmitted signal from a bs usually experiences multiple propagation phenomena including fast fading , slow fading and path loss @xcite .",
    "fast fading is caused by multipath propagation phenomena that results in rapid fluctuations of the received signal in terms of phase and amplitude .",
    "slow fading , which occurs as the signal travels through large obstructions such as buildings or hills , leads to the slower phase and amplitude changes over the period of transmission .",
    "path loss is a natural phenomenon in which the transmitted signal power gradually reduces when it travels over a distance . in this session",
    ", we will discuss about the statistical models of these propagation phenomena .      in most statistical models of wireless networks",
    ", it is assumed that all receiver antennas have the same gain and height .",
    "the received signal power at a receiver at a distance @xmath7 from the transmitter can be given by equation [ eq : pathloss ] @xcite : @xmath18 the propagation path loss in db unit is obtained by @xmath19 in which @xmath20 is path loss exponent ; p and @xmath21 are standard transmission power of a bs and a power adjustment coefficient , respectively , @xmath22 .",

    "the path loss can be estimated by measuring signal strength and then be overcome by increasing the transmission power .      the multipath effect at the mobile receiver due to scattering from local scatters such as buildings in the neighborhood of the receiver causes fast fading , while the variation in the terrain configuration between the base - station and the mobile receiver causes slow shadowing ( figure [ fig : fading ] ) .",
    "the received signal envelope is composed of a small scale multipath fading component superimposed on a larger scale or slower shadowing component .",
    "the signal envelope of the multipath component can be modeled as a rayleigh distributed rv , and its power can be modeled as an exponential rv .",
    "thus , the path power gain has a mixed rayleigh - lognormal distribution which is also known as the suzuki fading distribution model @xcite .",
    "the pdf of power gain @xmath25 of a signal experiencing rayleigh and lognormal fading is found from the pdf of the product two cascade channels @xcite .",

    "<S> the rayleigh - lognormal fading channels are considered , and it is assumed that each cell is allocated @xmath0 resource blocks ( rb ) to serve @xmath1 users . furthermore , the serving and interfering bs of a typical user are assumed to transmit at different power levels . </S>",
    "<S> the closed - form expression for the network coverage probability for both low and high snr is derived by using gauss - legendre approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the analytical results indicates that the performance of the typical user is proportional to the transmission power and density of bss when @xmath2 db and @xmath3 , and reaches the upper bound when @xmath4 db or @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the variance of monte carlo simulation is considered to verify the stability and accuracy of simulation results .    </S>",
