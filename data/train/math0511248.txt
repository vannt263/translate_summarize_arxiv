    "( noncrossing partitions are an important subject in modern combinatorics ; for an overview , see the excellent survey by simion @xcite . ) repeating the construction for @xmath8 instead of @xmath7 yields a second noncrossing matching that is interlaced with the first .",

    "it follows from a result of edelman @xcite that the basketballs are enumerated by the quasi - catalan numbers @xmath19 .",
