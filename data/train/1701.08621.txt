    "[ fig : neutron]a is magnetic in nature . the observation of this magnetic bragg peak , which is centered near q=0.945@xmath37 ( d=6.65 ) , indicates the onset of magnetic order .",
    "further investigation using a single crystal sample at the hb3a diffractometer allowed identification of the magnetic ordering vector ( wavevector ) as * * k**=(0.5 , 0.5 , 0.5 ) and the ordering temperature @xmath38=56(1)k , which is consistent with magnetization and heat capacity results . figure [ fig : neutron]a shows the order parameter measurement of the ( 0.5 , 1.5 , -0.5 ) magnetic bragg peak as a function of temperature .",
    "the temperature dependence of the peak intensity below @xmath38 was fit to a power law i(t)@xmath28(1-t / t@xmath4)@xmath39 , where @xmath25 is the critical exponent .",
    "this is shown on the lower left inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : neutron]a .",
    "the data obeys this relationship reasonably well down to about 16k below t@xmath4",
    ". a linear fit on the log - log plot in this temperature range gives a value of @xmath25=0.37(2 ) , which is similar to the theoretical prediction for the 3d heisenberg model .",
    "to evaluate the possible spin configurations , a magnetic symmetry analysis has been carried out using the tools available at the bilbao crystallographic server @xcite .",
    "the best fit of the 43 independent magnetic reflections has been obtained using a magnetic structure model defined by the magnetic space group @xmath40 , shown in fig [ fig : neutron]b . in this model",
    ", each lozenge - shaped tetramer has an up - down - up - down spin arrangement , with the alternating nonequivalent cr sites carrying antiparallel spins .",
    "the successive tetramers alternate their spins directions along all three crystallographic axes , leading to a doubling of the magnetic unit cell with respect to the nuclear cell in all three directions .",
    "the nearest neighbor tetramers can be arranged inside the _ bc _ plane in two equivalent configurations ( magnetic domains ) that produce stripes aligned along either the [ 0,1,1 ] or [ 0,-1,1 ] directions .",
    "the two magnetic domains are displayed in figure [ fig : neutron]c and d. our neutron data indicates an almost equal domain population ( 0.502(7)% and 0.498(7)% ) .",
    "the refined magnetic moment is 2.0(2 ) @xmath32 , with the following components along the crystallographic directions : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "the amplitude of the ordered moment is significantly smaller than the 3@xmath32 moment expected for trivalent cr ( s=3/2 ) .",
    "strong covalency between cr and te or direct cr - cr chemical bonding could reduce the cr moment ; however , electronic structure calculations described below give the full 3.0@xmath32 moment for cr .",
    "thus the reduced moment observed by neutron diffraction may be ascribed to incomplete magnetic ordering between the spin - lozenges , with residual disorder most likely along the layer stacking direction .",
    "this is supported by the neutron powder diffraction data , in which the magnetic ( 0.5 , 1.5 , -0.5 ) is broader and more asymmetric than the nearby nuclear 100 reflection @xcite .",
    "the intra - lozenge order is expected to be complete , as evidenced by the small value of @xmath31 and lack of a curie tail at low temperatures ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mag ] ) .",
    "stability of possible magnetic structures were compared using dft calculations .",
    "non - magnetic ( nm ) , ferromagnetic ( fm ) , and several antiferromagnetic ( afm ) structures were considered .",
    "table [ tab : theory ] shows the optimized lattice parameters from dft calculations performed using different magnetic configurations and calculational methods .",
    "all calculations used a 2x1x1 supercell model . as expected , neglecting the long range van der waals interaction ( pbe ) strongly overestimates the _ a_-axis length .",
    "of the magnetic models used , the afm2 structure is the closest approximation to the experimental structure , which would require a 2x2x2 supercell to represent exactly . in afm2 ( and afm3 ) every lozenge within one layer has the same up - down - up - down configuration , while in the experimental structure each layer contains stripes of lozenges with up - down - up - down and down - up - down - up configurations .",
    "all of the magnetic structures considered are at least 330mev more stable than the nm state . among the different magnetic configurations , afm2 and afm3 are more stable than fm and afm1 by about 30mev .",
    "although this is near the limit of precision for the calculations , it does support the experimentally determined magnetic structure .",
    "the calculations give a magnetic moment of 3.0@xmath32 per cr .",
    "the associated density of states in afm2 state is included in the supplemental material @xcite .",
    "some variation in the relaxed lattice constants is observed when different magnetic configuration are used in the calculations ( table [ tab : theory ] ) . in particular , the in - plane lattice parameters ( b and c ) are are significantly affected by the inclusion of magnetism .",
