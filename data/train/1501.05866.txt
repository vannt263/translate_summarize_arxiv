    "transit spectroscopy and differential photometry are largely used to investigate the composition and structure of exoplanetary atmospheres . the large majority of transiting exoplanets are `` hot jupiters '' , i.e. planets with size similar to jupiter orbiting very closely to their host star ( semimajor axis @xmath5au ) .",

    "another peculiarity of gj436b is its high orbital eccentricity ( @xmath110.16 ) , inferred from radial velocity measurements @xcite and from secondary eclipse phasing @xcite .",
    "both the physical and dynamical properties of gj436b are debated in the literature .",
    "@xcite and @xcite investigated the origin of the high orbital eccentricity of gj436b , concluding that the circularization timescale ( @xmath110@xmath12 yr ) is significantly smaller than the age of the system ( @xmath46@xmath1310@xmath14 ) .",
    "@xcite also found a long trend in radial velocity measurements ; they suggested the presence of an external perturber on a wider orbit to explain both the high eccentricity of gj436b and the long trend in radial velocity measurements .",
    "@xcite hypothesized a super - earth on a close orbit to explain those evidences , later retracted .",
    "transit timing variations ( ttvs ) reported by @xcite do not support any evidence of external perturbers .",
    "@xcite claimed the possible detection of two nearby sub - earth - sized exoplanets transiting in gj436 system ; according to the authors , the dynamic of the proposed system is consistent with the current non - ttv - detections .",

    "more recent hubble / wfc3 observations in the 1.2@xmath161.6 @xmath0 m wavelength interval , analyzed by @xcite , indicate a featureless transmission spectrum , which is consistent with relatively hydrogen - poor atmosphere with a high cloud or haze layer .",
    "in this paper we reanalyze four transit light - curves obtained with spitzer / irac at 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m passbands ( channels 1 and 2 of irac ) .",

    "this method has proven to give robust results , when applied to the transits of the hot - jupiter hd189733b observed with irac at 3.6 @xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "we further test here the performance of this detrending technique with the more challenging datasets of the neptune - sized planet gj436b , for which the transit depth is comparable with the amplitude of the instrumental pixel - phase signal , and the transit duration is very similar to the period of that signal .",

    "observed light - curves are linear combinations of these independent components , the coefficients of the linear combinations can be calculated by fitting the out - of - transit parts .",
    "to estimate the transit signal in a robust way , the fit is performed on the out - of - transit of the relevant integral light - curve , i.e. the sum of the pixel - light - curves from the array used , including all the non - transit components plus a constant term .",
    "the detrended transit signal is obtained by subtracting all the non - transit components , properly scaled by their fitting coefficients , from the integral light - curve .",
    "it is renormalized by the mean value on the out - of - transit , so that the out - of - transit level is unity .    after the extractions of the detrended and normalized transit time series , we modelled them by using the @xcite analytical formulae .",
    "we originally assumed the orbital period , @xmath19 , and the epoch of the first transit , @xmath20 , reported by @xcite ; the eccentricity , @xmath21 , and the argument of periastron , @xmath22 , reported by @xcite ; they are consistent with those reported by previous papers @xcite , and more accurate .",

    "[ fig1 ] reports the raw `` integral light - curves '' observed .",
    "the main systematic effect for irac channels 1 and 2 observations is an almost regular undulation with period @xmath13000 s , so - called pixel - phase effect , because it depends on the relative position of the source centroid with respect to a pixel center @xcite .",
    "this effect is particularly difficult to detrend from these datasets because its timescale is similar to the transit duration , and its amplitude is comparable to the transit depth . recently , a time dependence of the pixel - phase effect has been suggested @xcite .    if considering the whole datasets for detrending , our ica algorithm is able to remove most of the non - flatness on the out - of - transits , and visibly improve the in - transit shapes , but some visible issues remain ( see fig .

    "observations are linear mixtures of the source signals ; 3 .   the number of distinguishable observations is not smaller than the number of sources .    the first condition is easily verified if the signals have different origins , i.e. the astronomical target , other background objects , and the instruments .",

    "based on the following evidences , we found that , for spitzer / irac light - curves , the classic assumption of linear mixing leads to reliable and robust results :    * detrended light - curves present a low level of residual scatter , compared to the literature @xcite ; * planetary and stellar parameters measured at different epochs are consistent ( this is not a necessary condition ) ; * non - transit components have the same characteristics , e.g. periodicity and amplitude , of known instrumental systematics .",
    "this seems to be in contrast with the standard ( empirical ) pixel - phase effect method used to detrend spitzer data @xcite : flux measurements are correlated with the position of the centroid on a pixel , the cause of this is assumed to be an intra - pixel sensitivity variation , hence the systematics model is multiplied to the astrophysical signal .",
    "we are now investigating this question through simulated observations ( morello et al .",

    "; we report here our preliminary results :    * either inter- and intra - pixel effects ( or both ) can originate systematics similar to the ones observed in spitzer ; * inter - pixel effects are additive , as in our ica model ; * intra - pixel effects are not additive , but the ica algorithm is still able to significantly reduce their presence in the light - curves ( our simulations currently indicate a reduction by a factor of 7 for the amplitudes of systematic components from an original 3.5@xmath1310@xmath41 photometric level , outperforming the pixel - phase method by a factor of 2.3 - 3.3 ) .",
    "the third condition is case - dependent , since the number of components is not known a priori , and the number of pixels is limited by the width of the psf .",
    "also , if all the pixels contain the same systematic signals with the same weights relative to the astrophysical signal , the pixel - light - curves would not be distinguishable , and separation would be impossibile . given the results obtained , we infer that we have a sufficient number of distinguishable pixel - light - curves to detrend our signals up to a 2@xmath1310@xmath2 photometric precision .      in this section ,",
    "we discuss the ability of ica to separate different kinds of signals .",

    "[ fig14 ] and [ fig15 ] for some examples ) .",
