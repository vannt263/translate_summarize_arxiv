    "the kink at in the electronic dispersion along the brillouin zone diagonal ( i.e. , from @xmath6 to @xmath7 ) of high - t@xmath8 cuprate superconductors@xcite has been the object of intense scrutiny by the scientific community since it was first reported .",
    "understanding of the kink may be of importance in the context of the quest for the mechanism of high temperature superconductivity .",
    "unfortunately , a satisfactory understanding has not yet been achieved .",
    "while there is a broad ( yet not unanimous@xcite ) consensus that the kink is due to an interaction with bosonic excitations , the nature of the latter excitations remains controversial .",
    "it is debated whether they are of lattice@xcite ( phonon ) , magnetic@xcite ( spin fluctuation ) , or more complex@xcite origin@xcite .    regarding the magnetic scenario ,",
    "it has been claimed for some time that the kink reflects the coupling of the charged quasiparticles to the resonance mode observed by neutron scattering@xcite . in a more recent study by dahm and coworkers@xcite , however , it was strongly suggested that in underdoped yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 ( ybco ) , the kink is due to the upper branch of the hourglass dispersion of spin fluctuations , rather than to the resonance mode .",
    "this has opened the question of how the influence of the resonance mode and that of the upper branch cooperate , under which conditions the former is the dominant one , and under which the latter .    a relevant piece of information was recently reported by @xcite@xcite .",
    "these authors have shown that in nearly optimally doped bi@xmath2sr@xmath2cacu@xmath2o@xmath9 ( bi2212 ) , the energy of the kink decreases as a function of the angle between the fermi surface cut and the brillouin zone diagonal , from about at the node ( i.e. , at the diagonal ) , to about roughly one - third of the way to the antinode .",
    "in addition , when going from the node to the antinode , the kink and also the underlying structures of the quasiparticle self - energy sharpen dramatically .",
    "these trends of the kink energy and sharpness have been compared with simple estimates for several phonon modes and for the upper branch of the hourglass of spin fluctuations , and the greatest similarity has been found for the latter .",
    "the aims of the present study are ( a ) to address the angular dependence of the kink using the fully selfconsistent version of the eliashberg equations employed in previous studies by some of the authors@xcite , and the same inputs ( band structure and spin susceptibility ) as in ref .  , and to find out whether the model is capable of accounting for  in addition to the nodal dispersion  the trends reported recently by @xcite ( b ) to clarify the interplay between the roles of the resonance mode and of the upper branch of the hourglass in the formation of the kink .",

    "is mainly due to the lower value of @xmath17 used in the present study , as discussed in detail in subsec .",
    "[ sec : appendix ] .",
    "the position and the profile of the kink can be understood in terms of a combination of the geometrical features of the fermi surfaces and those of the spin susceptibility spectrum . consider a scattering process whereby an electron from the bonding band , of quasimomentum @xmath61 and energy @xmath62 , is scattered to the antibonding band , quasimomentum @xmath63 and energy @xmath64 , while a spin excitation of quasimomentum @xmath65 and energy @xmath66 is emitted ( an example with @xmath67 and @xmath68 is shown in fig .

    "[ fig : dahm_chi ]  , however , the probability is considerable ( see the constant energy cut in the lower right quadrant of fig .  [",

    "the nodal dispersion can thus be expected to be strongly influenced by the coupling to spin excitations of the upper branch .",
    "indeed , the calculated spectrum of @xmath75 , shown in fig .",

    "the kink itself ( defined as the minimum of the second derivative of the dispersion ) is located at a higher energy of about .",

    "this can be inferred from figure  [ fig : dahm_chi ] : the energy of the crossing point of the upper branch of @xmath35with a fixed @xmath78 horizontal line increases when the magnitude of @xmath78 decreases .",

    "the above analysis confirms the conclusions of ref .   regarding the origin of the kink .",
    "however , it additionally reveals that the presence of the upper branch _",
    "per se _ is not a sufficient condition for it to play the prominent role in the formation of the nodal kink .",
    "another necessary condition is the simultaneous occurrence of a low kurtosis@xcite of @xmath79 ( where @xmath80 is the frequency of the resonance mode ) and of a relatively small value of @xmath81 . only under these conditions",

    "a higher kurtosis of @xmath82 or a larger value of @xmath81 would allow the contribution of the resonance to be large enough and dominate that of the high - energy branch .",

    "we quantitatively assess the impact of the momentum dependence of the self - energy on the kink energy and shape , and identify two qualitatively distinct regimes .",
    "figure  [ fig : selfe_base ] illustrates the relationship between the energy of the kink and the energies of the features of the self - energy , for the set of parameter values @xmath46 .",
    "it shows the graphical solution of the equation for the quasiparticle energy @xmath91 , for two values of @xmath59 along the nodal axis : @xmath99 and @xmath100 ( the value of quasimomentum at which the kink occurs ) .",
    "also shown are the corresponding spectra of the real and imaginary components of the normal self - energy , and for @xmath100 , in addition , the normal spectral function @xmath101 .",
    "the spectral function for @xmath99 possesses a sharp quasiparticle peak at @xmath102 . for each of the two values of @xmath59 , @xmath91 is determined as the energy of the crossing between the corresponding black line ( representing @xmath103 ) and the corresponding blue line ( representing @xmath104 ) .",
    "the energies of the crossing points coincide with those of the quasiparticle peaks of @xmath101 , as expected .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath105 sets on at around as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : nodal_kink ] , and that the maximum of its kramers - kronig transform @xmath106 occurs at a higher energy ( approximately ) due to the finite width of the step in @xmath105 .",
    "finally , the aforementioned assumption of weak momentum dependence of the self - energy can be seen to be valid : even though the energy of the maximum of @xmath107 is higher than that of the maximum of @xmath106 by @xmath108 , the shapes of the profiles are qualitatively very similar .",
    "in particular , a sharp maximum is present in both profiles .",

    "figure  [ fig : selfe_dahm ] illustrates the properties of the system in this case .",
    "the large value of the coupling constant induces much larger magnitudes of the real and imaginary parts of the self - energy than in the former case .",
    "thus , the maximum value of @xmath114 is much larger , and the distance between @xmath77 and @xmath115 as well .",
    "figure  [ fig : selfe_dahm ] shows that over such a broad @xmath59-interval , the quasimomentum dependence of @xmath116 may no longer be considered to be weak .",
