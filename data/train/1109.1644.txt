    "the dirac phase factor @xmath2 with a phase containing spatial or temporal integrals of potentials ( of the general form @xmath3 ) @xmath2 is the standard and widely used solution of the gauge transformation equations of electrodynamics ( with @xmath4 and @xmath5 vector and scalar potentials respectively ) . in a quantum mechanical context",
    ", it connects wavefunctions of two systems ( with different potentials ) that experience the same classical fields at the observation point @xmath6 , the two more frequently discussed cases being : either systems that are completely gauge - equivalent ( a trivial case with no physical consequences ) , or systems that exhibit phenomena of the aharonov - bohm type ( magnetic or electric)@xcite @xmath2 and then this dirac phase has nontrivial observable consequences ( mathematically , this being due to the fact that the corresponding gauge function  is now multiple - valued ) . in the above two cases , the classical fields experienced by the two ( mapped )  systems are equal _ at every point _ of the accessible spacetime region .",
    "however , it has not been widely realized that the gauge transformation equations , viewed in a more general context , can have _ more general solutions _ than simple dirac phases , and these lead to wavefunction-_phase - nonlocalities _ that have been widely overlooked and that seem to have important physical consequences .",
    "these nonlocal solutions are applicable to cases where the two systems are allowed to experience _ different fields _ at spacetime points ( or regions ) that are _ remote _ to ( and do _ not _ contain ) the observation point @xmath6 ( these regions being _ physically accessible _ to the particle , unlike genuine aharonov - bohm cases ) . in this article",
    "we rigorously show the existence of these generalized solutions , demonstrate them in simple physical examples , and fully explore their structure , presenting cases ( and closed analytical results for the wavefunction - phases ) that actually connect ( or map ) two quantal systems that are * neither physically equivalent nor of the usual aharonov - bohm type*. we also fully investigate the consequences of these generalized ( _ nonlocal _ ) influences ( on wavefunction - phases ) and find them to be numerous and important ; we actually find them to be of a different type in static and in time - dependent field - configurations ( and in the latter cases we show that they lead to relativistically _ causal _ behaviors , that apparently resolve earlier paradoxes  arising in the literature from the use of standard dirac phase factors ) . the nonlocal phase behaviors discussed in the present work may be viewed as a justification for the ( recently emphasized@xcite ) terminology of dynamical nonlocalities  associated with all aharonov - bohm effects ( even static ones ) , although in our approach these nonlocalities seem to also respect causality ( without the need to independently invoke the uncertainty principle )  and , to the best of our knowledge , this is the first theoretical picture with such characteristics .    in order to introduce some background and further motivation for",
    "this article let us first remind the reader of a very basic property that will be central to everything that follows , which however is usually taken to be valid only in a restricted context ( but is actually more general than often realized ) .",
    "this property is a simple ( u(1 ) ) phase - mapping between quantum systems , and is usually taken in the context of gauge transformations , ordinary or singular@xmath7 here , however , it will appear in a more general framework , hence the importance of reminding of its independent , basic and more general origin .",
    "we begin by recalling that , if @xmath8 and @xmath9 are solutions of the time - dependent schrdinger ( or dirac ) equation for a quantum particle of charge @xmath10 that moves ( as a test particle ) in two distinct sets of ( predetermined and classical ) vector and scalar potentials ( @xmath11 ) and ( @xmath12 ) , that are generally spatially- and temporally - dependent [ and such that , at the spacetime point of observation @xmath13 , the magnetic and electric fields are the same in the two systems ] , then we have the following formal connection between the solutions ( wavefunctions ) of the two systems @xmath14 with the function @xmath15 required to satisfy @xmath16 the above property can be immediately proven by substituting each @xmath17 into its corresponding ( @xmath18 ) time - dependent schrdinger equation ( namely with the set of potentials ( @xmath19))@xmath1 one can then easily see that ( [ basic1 ] ) and ( [ basic11 ] ) guarantee that both schrdinger equations are indeed satisfied together ( after cancellation of a few terms and then elimination of a global phase factor in system 2 ) . [ in addition , the equality of all classical fields at the observation point , namely @xmath20 @xmath21 for the magnetic fields and @xmath22 for the electric fields , is obviously consistent with all equations ( [ basic11 ] ) ( as is easy to see if we take the _ curl _ of the 1st and the _ grad _ of the 2nd ) @xmath2 provided , at least , that @xmath15 is such that interchanges of partial derivatives with respect to all spatial and temporal variables ( at the point @xmath23 ) are allowed ] .",
    "as already mentioned , the above fact is of course well - known within the framework of the theory of quantum mechanical gauge transformations ( the usual case being for @xmath24 , hence for a mapping from a system with no potentials)@xmath7 but in that framework , these transformations are supposed to connect ( or map ) two _ physically equivalent systems _",
    "( more rigorously , this being true for ordinary gauge transformations , in which case the function @xmath15 , the so - called gauge function , is unique ( single - valued ) in spacetime coordinates ) . in a formally similar manner , the above argument is also often used in the context of the so - called singular gauge transformations , where @xmath25 is multiple - valued , but the above equality of classical fields is still imposed ( at the observation point , which always lies in a physically accessible region)@xmath7 then the above simple phase mapping ( at all points of the physically accessible spacetime region , that always and everywhere experience equal fields ) leads to the standard phenomena of the aharonov - bohm type , where _ unequal fields in physically inaccessible regions _ have observable consequences .",
    "however , we should keep in mind that that above property ( ( [ basic1 ] ) and ( [ basic11 ] ) taken together ) can be _ more generally valid _ @xmath2 and in this article we will present cases ( and closed analytical results for the appropriate phase connection @xmath15 ) that actually connect ( or map ) two systems ( in the sense of ( [ basic1 ] ) ) that are _ neither physically equivalent nor of the usual aharonov - bohm type_. and naturally , because of the above provision of field equalities at the observation point , it will turn out that any nonequivalence of the two systems will involve _ remote _ ( although _ physically accessible _ ) regions of spacetime , namely regions that do _ not _ contain the observation point @xmath13 ( and in which regions , as we shall see , the classical fields experienced by the particle may be _ different _ in the two systems ) .",
    "one may wonder on the actual reasons why one should be looking for more general cases of a simple phase mapping of the type ( [ basic1 ] ) between _ nonequivalent _ systems . to answer this ,",
    "let us take a step back and first recall some simple and well - known results that originate from the above phase mapping .",
    "it is standard knowledge , for example , that , if we want to find solutions @xmath26 of the @xmath27-dependent schrdinger ( or dirac ) equation for a quantum particle ( of charge @xmath28 that moves along a ( generally curved ) one - dimensional ( 1-d ) path , and in the presence ( somewhere in the embedding 3-dimensional ( 3-d ) space ) of a fairly localized ( and time - independent ) classical magnetic flux @xmath29 that _ does * not * pass through any point of the path , _ then we formally have @xmath30 ( the dummy variable @xmath31 describing points along the 1-d path , and the term formally  signifying that the above is valid _ before imposition of any boundary conditions _ ( meaning that these are to be imposed only on @xmath32 and not necessarily on @xmath33 ) . in ( [ standard ] ) , @xmath34 is a formal solution of the same system in the case of absence of any potentials ( hence with magnetic flux @xmath35 everywhere in the 3-d space ) .",
    "the above holds because , for _ all points _ @xmath31 of the 1-d path , the particle experiences a vector potential @xmath36 of the form @xmath37 ( since the magnetic field is @xmath38 * * for _ all _ @xmath31 , by assumption ) , in combination with the above phase - mapping ( with a phase @xmath39 ) between two quantum systems , one in the presence and one in the absence of a vector potential ( i.e. the potentials in ( [ basic11 ] ) being @xmath40 and @xmath41 @xmath42 , together with @xmath43 if we decide to attribute everything to vector potentials only ) . in this particular system , the obvious @xmath44 that solves the above @xmath45 ( for * all * points of the 1-d space available to the particle ) is indeed @xmath46 ( since @xmath47 ) , and this gives ( [ standard ] ) ( if @xmath48 denotes the above point @xmath49 of observation and @xmath50 the arbitrary initial point @xmath51 ( both lying on the physical path ) , and if the constant @xmath52 is taken to be zero ) .",
    "what if , however , some parts of the magnetic field that comprise the magnetic flux @xmath29 actually _ pass through _ some points or a whole region ( interval ) of the path available to the particle ?",
    "in such a case , the above standard argument is not valid ( as @xmath42 can not be written as a grad at any point of the interval where the magnetic field @xmath53 ) .",
    "are there however general results that we can still write for @xmath54 , if the spatial point of observation @xmath49 is again outside the interval with the nonvanishing magnetic field ? or , what if in the previous problems , the magnetic flux ( either remote , or partly passing through the path ) is time - dependent @xmath55 ?",
    "( in that case then , there exists in general an additional electric field @xmath56 induced by faraday s law of induction on points of the path , and the usual gauge transformation argument is once again not valid ) .",
    "returning to another standard ( solvable ) case ( which is actually the dual  or the electric analog  of the above ) , if along the 1-d physical path the particle experiences only a spatially - uniform ( but generally time - dependent ) classical scalar potential @xmath57 , we can again formally map @xmath58 to a potential - free solution @xmath34 , through a @xmath59 that now solves @xmath60 , and this gives @xmath61 , leading to the electric analog  of ( [ standard ] ) , namely @xmath62 with obvious notation .",
    "( notice that , for either of the two mapped systems in this problem , the electric field is zero at all points of the path ) .",
    "what if , however , the scalar potential has also some @xmath49-dependence along the path ( that leads to an electric field ( in a certain interval ) that the particle passes through ) ?",
    "in such a case , the above standard argument is again not valid . are there however general results that we can still write for @xmath63 , if the spatial point of observation @xmath49 is again outside the interval with the nonvanishing electric field ?",
    "we state here directly that this article will provide affirmative answers to questions of the type posed above , by actually giving the corresponding general results in closed analytical forms .",
    "at this point it is also useful to briefly reconsider the earlier mentioned case , namely of a time - dependent @xmath55 that is remote to the 1-d physical path , because in this manner we can immediately provide another motivation for the present work@xmath1 this time - dependent problem is surrounded with a number of important misconceptions in the literature ( the same being true about its electric analog , as we shall see)@xmath1 the formal solution that is usually written down for a @xmath55 is again ( [ standard ] ) , namely the above spatial line integral of @xmath42 , in spite of the fact that @xmath42 is now @xmath27-dependent@xmath7 the problem then is that , because of the first of ( [ basic11 ] ) , @xmath25 must now have a @xmath27-dependence and , from the second of ( [ basic11 ] ) , there must necessarily be scalar potentials involved in the problem ( which have been by force set to zero , in our pre - determined mapping between vector potentials only ) .",
    "having decided to use systems that experience only vector ( and not scalar ) potentials , the correct solution can not be simply a trivial @xmath27-dependent extension of ( [ standard ] ) .",
    "a corresponding error is usually made in the electric dual of the above , namely in cases that involve @xmath48-dependent scalar potentials , where ( [ standard2 ] ) is still erroneously used ( with @xmath64 replaced by @xmath65 ) , giving an @xmath48-dependent @xmath25 , although this would necessarily lead to the involvement of vector potentials ( through the first of ( [ basic11 ] ) and the @xmath48-dependence of @xmath25 ) that have been neglected from the beginning @xmath2 a situation ( and an error ) that appears , in exactly this form , in the description of the so - called electric aharonov - bohm effect@xcite as we shall see .",
    "speaking of errors in the literature , it might here be the perfect place to also point to the reader the most common misleading statement often made in the literature ( and again , for notational simplicity , we restrict our attention to a one - dimensional system , with spatial variable @xmath49 , although the statement is obviously generalizable to ( and often made for systems of ) higher dimensionality by properly using line integrals over arbitrary curves in space)@xmath1 it is usually stated [ e.g. in brown & holland@xcite , see i.e. their eq .",
    "( 57 ) applied for vanishing boost velocity @xmath66 that the general gauge function that connects ( through a phase factor @xmath67 ) the wavefunctions of a quantum system with no potentials ( i.e. with a set of potentials @xmath68 ) to the wavefunctions of a quantum system that moves in vector potential @xmath69 and scalar potential @xmath70 ( i.e. in a set of potentials @xmath71 ) is the obvious combination ( and a natural extension ) of ( [ standard ] ) and ( [ standard2 ] ) , namely @xmath72 which , however , is * incorrect * for @xmath49 and @xmath27 uncorrelated variables@xmath1 it does * not * satisfy the standard system * *  * * of gauge transformation equations @xmath73 the reader can easily see why : ( i ) when the @xmath74 operator acts on eq.([wrong ] ) , it gives the correct @xmath75 from the 1st term , but it also gives some annoying additional nonzero quantity from the 2nd term ( that survives because of the @xmath49-dependence of @xmath5 ) ; hence it invalidates the first of the basic system ( [ basicpde ] ) .",
    "( ii ) similarly , when the @xmath76 operator acts on eq.([wrong ] ) , it gives the correct @xmath70 from the 2nd term , but it also gives some annoying additional nonzero quantity from the 1st term ( that survives because of the @xmath27-dependence of @xmath42 ) ; hence it invalidates the second of the basic system ( [ basicpde ] ) .",
    "it is only when @xmath42 is @xmath27-independent , and @xmath5 is spatially - independent , that eq.([wrong ] ) can be correct ( as the above annoying terms do not appear and the basic system is satisfied ) , although it is still not necessarily the most general form for @xmath25 , as we shall see .",
    "[ an alternative form that is also widely thought to be correct is again eq.([wrong ] ) , but with the variables that are not integrated over implicitly assumed to belong to the initial point ( hence a @xmath77 replaces @xmath27 in @xmath42 , and simultaneously an @xmath51 replaces @xmath49 in @xmath5 ) .",
    "however , one can see again that the system ( [ basicpde ] ) is not satisfied ( the above differential operators , when acted on @xmath25 , give @xmath78 and @xmath79 , hence not the values of the potentials at the point of observation @xmath80 as they should ) , this not being an acceptable solution either ] .    what is the problem here ? or ,",
    "better put , what is the deeper reason for the above inconsistencies ?",
    "the short answer is the uncritical use of dirac phase factors that come from path - integral treatments .",
    "it is indeed obvious that the form ( [ wrong ] ) that is often used in the literature ( in canonical ( non - path - integral ) formulations where @xmath49 and @xmath27 are * uncorrelated * variables ( and not correlated to produce a path @xmath81 ) ) _ is not generally correct _ , and that is one of the main points that has motivated this work .",
    "we will find _ generalized results _ that actually _ correct _",
    "eq.([wrong ] ) through extra nonlocal terms , and through the proper appearance of @xmath51 and @xmath77 ( as in eq.([lambdastatic1 ] ) and eq.([lambdastatic2 ] ) to be found later in section iii ) , and these are the * exact * ones ( namely the exact @xmath82 that at the end , upon action of @xmath74 and @xmath76 satisfies exactly the basic system ( [ basicpde ] ) , viewed as a system of partial differential equations ( pdes ) ) .",
    "and the formulation that gives these results is generalized later in the article , for @xmath83 ( in the 2-d static case ) and also for @xmath84 ( in the full dynamical 2-d case ) , and leads to the exact ( nontrivial ) forms of the phase function @xmath25 that satisfy ( in all cases ) the system ( [ basicpde ] ) @xmath2 with _ the direct verification  _",
    "proof , by going backwards , that these forms are indeed the exact solutions of _ ( [ basicpde ] ) ) _ also being given _ for the reader s convenience__. _ _ [ for the direct  and rigorous mathematical derivations see @xcite . ]",
    "this article gives a full exploration of issues related to the above motivating discussion , by pointing to a practical  ( and generalized ) use of gauge transformation mapping techniques , that at the end lead to these generalized ( and , at first sight , unexpected ) solutions for the general form of @xmath25 . for cases such as the ones discussed above , or even more involved ones",
    ", there still appears to exist a simple phase mapping ( between two inequivalent systems ) , but the phase connection @xmath25 seems to contain not only integrals of potentials , but also fluxes  of the classical field - differences from _ remote _ spacetime regions ( regions , however , that are physically accessible to the particle ) . the above mentioned systems",
    "are the simplest ones where these new results can be applied , but apart from this , the present investigation seems to lead to a number of nontrivial corrections of misleading ( or even incorrect ) reports of the above type in the literature , that are not at all marginal ( and are due to an incorrect use of a path - integral viewpoint in an otherwise canonical framework  an error that appears to have been made repeatedly since the original conception of the path - integral formulation , as we shall see ) .",
    "the generalized @xmath25-forms also lead to an honest resolution of earlier paradoxes  ( involving relativistic causality ) , and in some cases to a new interpretation of known semiclassical experimental observations , corrections of certain sign - errors in the literature , and nontrivial extensions of earlier semiclassical results to general ( even completely delocalized ) states . [ as a byproduct , we will also show that  contrary to what is usually stated in earlier but also recent popular reports  the semiclassical phase picked up by classical trajectories ( that are deflected by the lorentz force ) is _ opposite _ ( and not equal ) to the so - called aharonov - bohm phase due to the flux enclosed by the same trajectories@xmath7 we will also provide 2 figures to visually assist the detailed proof of this result as well as to facilitate an elementary physical understanding of this opposite sign relation ] .",
    "most importantly , however , the new formulation seems capable of addressing causal issues in time - dependent single- _ vs _ double - slit experiments , an area that seems to have recently attracted attention@xcite ) .",
    "let us begin with the simplest case of 1-d systems but in the most general dynamic environment , i.e. a single quantum particle of charge @xmath85 , but in the presence of arbitrary ( spatially nonuniform and time - dependent ) vector and scalar potentials .",
    "let us actually consider this particle moving either inside a set of potentials @xmath86 and @xmath87 ( case 1 ) or inside a set of potentials @xmath88 and @xmath89 ( case 2 ) , and try to determine the most general gauge function @xmath90 that takes us from ( maps ) the wavefunctions of the particle in case 1 to those of the same particle in case 2 ( meaning the usual mapping ( [ basic1 ] ) between the wavefunctions of the two systems through the phase factor @xmath91 ) .",
    "[ as already noted , we should keep in mind that for this mapping to be possible we _ must _ assume that at the point @xmath80 of observation ( or measurement  of @xmath25 or the wavefunction @xmath92 )  we have equal electric fields ( @xmath93 ) , namely @xmath94 ( so that the @xmath95 s and @xmath5 s in ( [ efield ] ) can indeed satisfy the basic system of equations ( [ basic11 ] ) , or equivalently , of the system of equations ( [ xt - basicsystem ] ) below @xmath2 as can be seen by taking the @xmath96 of the 1st and the @xmath97 of the 2nd of the system ( [ xt - basicsystem ] ) and adding them together)@xmath98 but again , we will _ not _ exclude the possibility of the two systems passing through _ different _ electric fields in other regions of spacetime ( that do _ not _ contain the observation point ) , i.e. for @xmath99 .",
    "in fact , this possibility * will come out naturally * from a careful solution of the basic system ( [ xt - basicsystem])@xmath7 it is for example straightforward for the reader to immediately verify that the results ( [ lambdastatic1 ] ) or ( [ lambdastatic2 ] ) that will be derived below ( and will contain contributions of electric field - differences from remote regions of spacetime ) indeed satisfy the basic input system of equations ( [ xt - basicsystem ] ) , something that will be explicitly verified below ] .",
    "returning to the question on the appropriate @xmath25 that takes us from the set @xmath100 to the set @xmath101 , we note again that , in cases of static vector potentials ( @xmath102 s ) _ and _ spatially uniform scalar potentials ( @xmath57 s ) the form usually given for @xmath25 is the well - known @xmath103 with @xmath104  and @xmath105 ( and it can be viewed as a combination of ( [ standard ] ) and ( [ standard2 ] ) , being immediately applicable to the description of cases of _ combined _ magnetic and electric aharonov - bohm effects ) .",
    "but as already noted , even in the most general case , with @xmath27-dependent @xmath95 s and @xmath49-dependent @xmath5 s ( and with the variables@xmath106  and@xmath107 being * completely uncorrelated * ) , it is often stated in the literature that the appropriate @xmath25 has a form that is a plausible extention of ( [ lambdausual ] ) , namely @xmath108   dx^{\\prime}-c{\\displaystyle\\int\\limits_{t_{0}}^{t } } \\left [   \\phi_{2}(x , t^{\\prime})-\\phi_{1}(x , t^{\\prime})\\right ]   dt^{\\prime } , \\label{brownholland}\\ ] ] [ with eq . ( 57 ) of ref.@xcite , taken for @xmath109 , being a very good example to point to , since that article does not use a path - integral language , but a canonical formulation with uncorrelated variables ] . and as already pointed out in section ii , this form is certainly  _ incorrect _  for uncorrelated variables @xmath49 and @xmath27  ( the reader can easily verify that the system of equations ( [ xt - basicsystem ] ) below is @xmath110 satisfied by ( [ brownholland ] ) @xmath2 see again section ii , especially the paragraph after eq.([basicpde]))@xmath98 we will find in the present work that the correct form consists of two major modifications of ( [ brownholland])@xmath1 ( i ) the first leads to the natural appearance of a _ path _ that continuously connects initial and final points in spacetime , a property that ( [ brownholland ] ) _ does not have _ [ indeed ,",
    "if the integration curves of ( [ brownholland ] ) are drawn in the @xmath80-plane , they do _ not _ form a continuous path from @xmath111 to @xmath80 ] .",
    "( ii ) and the second modification is highly nontrivial@xmath1 it consists of nonlocal contributions of classical electric field - differences from remote regions of spacetime .",
    "we will discuss below the consequences of these terms and we will later show that such nonlocal contributions also appear ( in an extended form ) in more general situations , i.e. they are also present in higher spatial dimensionality ( and they then also involve remote magnetic fields in combination with the electric ones)@xmath7 these lead to modifications of ordinary aharonov - bohm behaviors or have other important consequences , one of them being a natural remedy of causality paradoxes  in time - dependent aharonov - bohm experiments .",
    "the form ( [ brownholland ] ) commonly used is of course motivated by the well - known wu & yang@xcite nonintegrable phase factor , that has a phase equal to  @xmath113 ,  a form that appears naturally within  the framework of path - integral treatments , or generally in physical situations where narrow wavepackets are implicitly assumed for the quantum particle * * : * * the integrals appearing in ( [ brownholland ] ) are then taken along particle trajectories ( hence spatial and temporal variables _ not _ being uncorrelated , but being connected in a particular manner @xmath81 to produce the path@xmath7 all integrals are therefore basically only time - integrals ) .",
    "but even then , eq.([brownholland ] ) is valid only when these trajectories are always ( in time ) and everywhere ( in space ) inside identical classical fields for the two ( mapped ) systems . here",
    ", however , we will be focusing on what a canonical ( and not a path - integral or other semiclassical ) treatment leads to@xmath7 this will cover the general case of arbitrary wavefunctions that can even be completely spread - out in space , and will also allow the particle to travel through different electric fields for the two systems in remote spacetime regions ( e.g. @xmath114  if @xmath115  etc . ) .",
    "it is therefore clear that finding the appropriate @xmath116  that achieves the above mapping _ in full generality _ will require a careful solution of the system of pdes ( [ basic11 ] ) , applied to only one spatial variable , namely @xmath117 ( with @xmath118  and @xmath119 ) .",

    "this is quite reminiscent of the cancellation of phases observed in the early experiments of werner & brill@xcite for particles passing through a magnetic field ( a cancellation between the aharonov - bohm phase  and the semiclassical phase picked up by the trajectories ) , and our method seems to provide a natural explanation@xmath1 as our results are general ( and for delocalized states in simple - connected space they basically demonstrate the uniqueness of @xmath25 ) , they are also valid and applicable to states that describe wavepackets in classical motion , as _ was _ the case of the werner & brill experiments .",
    "( a similar cancellation of an electric aharonov - bohm phase , that has never been noted in the literature , also occurs for particles passing through a static electric field , and this we will independently prove below , again for semiclassical states ) . we conclude that , for static cases , and when particles pass through nonvanishing classical fields , the new nonlocal terms reported in the present work lead quite generally to a cancellation of aharonov - bohm phases that had earlier been only sketchily noticed and only at the semiclassical ( magnetic ) level .",
    "figure2.eps    what is however more important to point out here is that the above cancellations can be understood as a compatibility between the aharonov - bohm fringe - displacement and the trajectory - deflection due to the lorentz force ( i.e. the semiclassical phase picked up due to the optical path difference of the two deflected trajectories _ exactly cancels _ ( is _ opposite in sign _ from ) the aharonov - bohm phase  picked up by the same trajectories due to the flux that they enclose ) .",

    "we have therefore @xmath273 now , the lorentz force ( exerted only during the passage through the thin magnetic strip , hence only during a time interval @xmath274 ) has a component parallel to the screen ( let us call it @xmath49-component ) that is given by @xmath275 which shows that there is a change of kinematic momentum ( parallel to the screen ) equal to @xmath276 or , equivalently , a change of parallel speed @xmath277 which is the speed of the central fringe s motion ( i.e. its displacement over time along the screen ) .",
    "although this has been caused by the presence of the thin deflecting magnetic strip , this displacement is occuring uniformly during a time interval @xmath278 and this time interval must satisfy @xmath279 ( as , for small displacements , the wavepackets travel most of the time in uniform motion , i.e. @xmath280 ) .",

    "this is a rather pleasing characteristic of this theory that , as far as we are aware , has no parallel in other formulations .",

    "this combines effects of ( perpendicular ) magnetic fields ( which , if present only in physically - inaccessible regions , can have aharonov - bohm consequences ) with the temporal nonlocalities of electric fields ( parallel to the plane ) found in previous sections . by working again in cartesian spatial coordinates , we now have to deal with the full system of pdes @xmath307 this exercise is considerably longer than the previous ones but important to solve , in order to see in what manner the solutions of this system are able to _ combine _ the spatial and temporal nonlocal effects found above .",

    "the corresponding ( rather long ) procedure for solving the system ( [ fullsystem ] ) is described in detail in @xcite , and 2 out of the 12 solutions that can be derived turn out to be the most crucial for the discussion that will follow .",
    "first , by following steps similar to the ones of section iv , the following temporal generalization of ( [ lambda(x , y)4 ] ) is obtained @xmath308 @xmath309 @xmath310 and from this point on , the third equation of the system ( [ fullsystem ] ) is getting involved to determine the nontrivial effect of scalar potentials on @xmath311 indeed , by combining it with ( [ lambda(x , y , t)213 ] ) there results a wealth of patterns , one of them leading finally to our first solution , namely @xmath312 @xmath313 with the functions @xmath314  and @xmath315  to be chosen in such a way as to satisfy the following 3 independent conditions@xmath1 @xmath316 which is of course a special case of the condition on @xmath317 above ( see after ( [ lambda(x , y , t)213 ] ) ) applied at @xmath318 , and the other 2 turn out to be of the form @xmath319 @xmath320 ( it is probably important to note that for the above results the faraday s law is crucial@xcite ) . as for the constant quantity  @xmath321 appearing in ( [ lambdafull1 ] ) , it again describes possible effects of multiple - connectivity at the instant @xmath77 ( which are absent for simple - connected spacetimes , but will be crucial in the discussion of the van kampen thought - experiment to be discussed later below ) .",
    "( [ lambdafull1 ] ) is our first solution .",
    "it is now crucial to note that an alternative form of solution ( with the functions @xmath322 and @xmath323 satisfying the _ same _ conditions as above ) can be derived , and it turns out to be @xmath324 @xmath325 in this alternative solution we note that , in comparison with ( [ lambdafull1 ] ) , the line - integrals of @xmath326  have changed to the _ other _ alternative path  ( note the difference in the placement of the coordinates of the initial point @xmath195 in the arguments of @xmath327 and @xmath328 compared to ( [ lambdafull1 ] ) ) and they happen to have the same sense as the @xmath4-integrals , while simultaneously the magnetic flux difference shows up with its value at the initial time @xmath77 rather than at @xmath27 .",
    "this alternative form will be shown to be useful in cases where we want to directly compare physical situations in the present ( at time @xmath27 ) and in the past ( at time @xmath77 ) , and the above noted change of sense of @xmath329-integrals ( compared to ( [ lambdafull1 ] ) ) will be crucial in the discussion that follows in the next section .",

    "we finally obtain the following solution ( the spatially dual  of ( [ lambdafull1 ] ) ) , namely @xmath330 @xmath331 with the functions @xmath332  and @xmath315  to be chosen in such a way as to satisfy the following 3 independent conditions@xmath1 @xmath333    @xmath334    @xmath335 where again for the above results the faraday s law is crucial .",
    "the corresponding analog of the alternative form ( [ lambdafull2 ] ) ( where @xmath196 appears at @xmath77 ) is more important for the discussion that follows and turns out to be @xmath336 @xmath337 with @xmath332 and @xmath338 following the same 3 conditions above .",
    "the constant term @xmath339 again describes possible multiplicities at the instant @xmath340 it is absent for simple - connected spacetimes , but will be crucial in the discussion of the van kampen thought - experiment .    in ( [ lambdafull4 ] ) ( and in ( [ lambdafin ] ) ) , note the alternative paths  ( compared to solution ( [ lambdafull1 ] ) ( and ( [ lambdafull2 ] ) ) ) of line integrals of @xmath4 s ( or of @xmath329 s ) . but",
    "the most crucial element for what follows is the need to _ exclusively _ use the forms ( [ lambdafull2 ] ) and ( [ lambdafin ] ) ( where @xmath196 only appears at @xmath77 ) , and the fact that , within each solution , the sense of @xmath4-integrals is the _ same _ as the sense of the @xmath329-integrals .",
    "( this is _ not _ true in the other solutions where @xmath341 appears , as the reader can directly see ) .",

    "although peshkin uses his eq.(b.5 ) and ( b.6 ) ( based on the incorrect ( [ wrong ] ) ) , he carefully states that it is not the full solution ; actually , if we view it as an _ ansatz _ , then it is understandable why he needs to enforce a _ condition _ ( his eq.(b.8 ) , and later ( b.9 ) ) on the electric field outside the cages ( in order for certain ( annoying ) terms ( resulting from a minimal substitution due to the incorrect ansatz ) to vanish and for ( b.5 ) to be a solution ) .",
    "but then he notes that the extra condition can not always be satisfied ( hence ( b.5 ) is not really the solution for all times ) , drawing from this the above qualitatively correct conclusion on causality .",

    "the causally - offending part of the electric aharonov - bohm phase difference will be cancelled by a magnetic type of phase , that originates from the magnetic field that is associated with the @xmath27-dependence of the electric field @xmath329 outside the cages .",

    ", it should be stressed that at the level of the basic lagrangian @xmath366  there are no fields present , and the view holds in the literature@xcite that electric fields or magnetic fields can not contribute directly to the phase .",
    "this view originates from the path - integral treatments widely used ( where the lagrangian determines directly the phases of propagators ) , but , nevertheless , our canonical treatment shows that fields _ do _ contribute nonlocally , and they are actually crucial in recovering relativistic causality .",
    "moreover , path - integral discussions@xcite of the van kampen case use wave ( retarded)-solutions for @xmath42 ( hence in the lorenz gauge ) and are incomplete ; our results take advantage of the retardation of _ fields _ @xmath367 and @xmath368 * * ( true in _ any _ gauge ) , and _ not _ of potentials . in addition , troudet@xcite correctly states that his path - integral treatment is good for not highly - delocalized states in space , and that in case of delocalization the proper treatment would be much more complicated , and would require a much more complete analysis .",
    "it is fair to state that such a complete analysis has actually been provided in the present work",
    ". it should be added that the van kampen paradox  seems to be still thought of as remarkable  @xcite .",
    "the present work has provided a natural and general _ resolution _ , and most importantly , through nonlocal ( and relativistically causal ) propagation of wavefunction - phases .    finally , in trying to explore an even broader significance of the new solutions",
    ", one may wonder about possible consequences of the nonlocal terms if these are included in more general physical models that have a gauge structure ( in condensed matter or high energy physics ) .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that if one follows the same unconventional  method ( of solution of pdes ) with the maxwell s equations for the electric and magnetic fields ( rather than with the pdes of eq.([basic11 ] ) for the potentials that give @xmath25 ) , the corresponding nonlocal terms can be derived in a similar manner , and one can then see that these nonlocal terms essentially demonstrate the causal propagation of the radiation electric and magnetic fields outside physically inaccessible confined sources ( i.e. solenoids or electric cages ) .",
    "although this is of course widely known at the level of classical fields , a major conclusion that can be drawn from the present work ( at the level of gauge transformations ) is that _ a corresponding causality also exists at the level of quantum mechanical phases _ as well , and this is enforced by the nonlocal terms in @xmath27-dependent cases .",
    "it strongly indicates that the nonlocal terms found in this work at the level of quantum mechanical phases reflect a causal propagation of wavefunction phases * in the schrdinger picture * ( at least one part of them @xmath2 the one containing the fields @xmath2 which competes with the aharonov - bohm types of phases containing the potentials ) .",
    "this is an entirely new concept ( given the _ local nature _ but also the",
    "_ nonrelativistic character _ of the schrdinger equation ) and deserves to be further explored .",
    "it would indeed be worth investigating possible applications of the above results ( of nonlocal phases of wavefunctions , solutions of the local schrdinger equation ) to @xmath27-dependent single- _ vs _ double - slit experiments recently discussed by the group of aharonov@xcite who use a completely different method , with modular variables in the heisenberg picture ( presented as the sole method appropriate for problems of this type ) .",
    "one should also note recent work@xcite , that rightly emphasizes that physics can not currently predict how we dynamically go from the single - slit diffraction pattern to the double - slit diffraction pattern ( whether it is in a gradual and causal manner or not ) and where a relevant experiment is proposed to decide on ( address ) exactly this largely unknown issue .",
    "application of our nonlocal terms to such questions in analogous experiments ( i.e. by introducing ( finite ) scalar potentials on slits in a @xmath27-dependent way ) provides a completely new formulation for addressing causal issues of this type , and is worth of further investigation .",
    "furthermore , it is worth noting that , if @xmath56 s were substituted by gravitational fields and @xmath266 s by coriolis force fields arising in non - inertial ( rotating ) frames of reference , the above nonlocalities ( and their apparent causal nature ) could possibly have an interesting story to tell about quantum mechanical phase behavior in a relativistic / gravitational framework . finally , _",
    "su(2 ) _ generalizations would be an obviously interesting extension of the above _",
    "u(1 ) _ theory , and such generalizations are rather formally direct and not difficult to make@xmath7 an immediate physically interesting question would then be whether the new nonlocal terms might have a nontrivial impact on i.e. spin-@xmath369-states , since these terms would act asymmetrically on opposite spins ( the nonlocal @xmath196-terms being relevant for zeeman interactions , and the nonlocal @xmath56-terms possibly having a role if the above results were applied i.e. to condensed matter systems with strong spin - orbit coupling@xcite ) .",
    "we conclude that a nonlocal and causal behavior exists at the level of quantum mechanical phases , even for solutions of the nonrelativistic ( and local ) schrdinger equation and this behavior is enforced by the nonlocal terms derived in the present work ( through the well - known causal behavior of fields ) .",

    "a natural thought then arising from the present work is that , if those emerging potentials are not of a type that would correspond to zero fields ( in the physically accessible regions ) , but describe nonvanishing effective fields in ( even remote ) spacetime regions that are accessible to the particles , then one would expect that the new nonlocalities should be seriously taken into account @xmath2 these having certain dynamical consequences that may have not received an entirely proper treatment in earlier works . given the popularity and importance of these areas in the whole of physics , issues such as the above would certainly deserve further study .",
