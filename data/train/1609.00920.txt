    "_ distribution of point sampling : _ we mentioned in [ sec : persistent_homology_of_a_cow ] that , if we were handed a uniformly sampled point cloud from a space , then we probably would nt gain much from asking for another set of uniformly sampled data .",
    "it seems like there should be some way of analysing how the distribution of the sampled data affects the resulting barcode : if we know that our points are distributed unevenly , say polynomially or exponentially more points are found around certain areas , can we predict how this will change the barcode ? obviously , for persistent homology , if we are dealing with some smooth manifold then it is the critical points that are of interest .",
    "so if we are told that our points were sampled from near these critical points , then how can we use this fact to improve our method of computing persistent homology ? depending on the specific embedding or immersion of the manifold , a naive calculation of the vietoris - rips complex might provide woefully inaccurate estimations as to the global homology .",
    "_ symmetry of extended persistent homology : _ the barcodes in [ fg : klein - bifiltration - barcode ] have an interesting symmetry to them .",
    "part of this is easily understandable : with this ` convex ' immersion of the klein bottle and any height function , the @xmath84th homology will always be born at @xmath85 and die at @xmath86 , and the @xmath87nd homology will always be born at @xmath88 and die at @xmath89 . but how can we formalise the symmetry in the @xmath90st homology ?",
    "if we compute the extended persistence homology of the torus embedded ` vertically ' in @xmath83 ( i.e. with the hole perpendicular to the height function ) then the intervals of the two @xmath90st homology classes have a rotational symmetry around @xmath91 , which is different to the mirror symmetry found in [ fg : klein - bifiltration - barcode ] .",
    "is this possibly to do with the orientability of the surface ? 3 .",
    "software for extended persistent homology : _ as listed in @xcite , there are many libraries for computing persistent homology , all with their various strengths and weaknesses . none of them , however , seem to be able to compute extended persistent homology .",
    "would it be feasible to extend them to be able to do so , or would it be easier to write new dedicated code to do this task",
    "? it also seems possible that , with the powerful tools provided by mathematica , we could compute the ( extended ) persistent homology of 3d models : we can define a height function @xmath92 ; calculate the ` height slices ' @xmath93 ; discretise ( triangulate ) the resulting space ; convert into simplicial data ; and then calculate the homology computationally .",
    "probabilistic persistent homology : _ extended persistent homology ensures that all classes die in finite time .",
    "this means that , at any given time , the persistence of a class is simply ` how long it has left to live ' .",
    "if we are handed some @xmath25-th homology class at time @xmath94 then we can calculate a probability that it is alive at time @xmath95 by simply looking at the proportion of @xmath25-th homology classes that persist until @xmath95 .",
    "this naive idea becomes more interesting when we turn it around : given a slice of the barcode , say between times @xmath96 and @xmath97 , can we use the probabilities of a class persisting for time @xmath98 calculated from that slice to predict what might happen elsewhere in the barcode ? that is , if we see many @xmath25-th homology classes being born and dying then it seems possible that this is a trait of the filtration ",
    "it is ` @xmath25-th homology noisy '  and so we can take into account the fact that these classes have a high probability of dying in a short time when trying to reconstruct the rest of the barcode from finite data .",
    "alternatively , is there anything to be gained from adopting an entirely stochastic viewpoint of persistent homology : drawing influence from the theory of statistical lifetime models ?",
    "we do nt allow ourselves access to all of the information about @xmath24 , or its barcode .",
    "instead , we can randomly sample various homology classes and look at how long they persists . in doing so",
    ", we can build up a statistical idea of the persistent homology , and try to fit it to some probabilistic model .",
