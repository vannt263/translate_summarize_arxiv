    "we simply mention that they have been studied from the point of view of random analytic functions ( cf @xcite ) ; random matrix theory , where eigenvalues are zeros of characteristic polynomials of random matrices ( cf @xcite ) ; and determinantal point processes ( cf @xcite ) .",
    "previous results specifically relating zeros and critical points of random polynomials are much more limited , however .",

    "namely , we fix some some number of zeros and choose the others uniformly and independently from a fixed probability measure on @xmath3 in this situation , we are able to give the first completely elementary proof of the pairing of zeros and critical points for a random polynomial .    the other article we are aware of is the heuristic work of dennis - hannay @xcite from the physics literature .",

    "the idea that zeros and critical points of a complex polynomials have an electrostatic interpretation goes back to gauss ( * ? ? ?",
    "* preface and  2 ) . and the observation that zeros with a large modulus should be paired to a critical point in certain special kinds of random polynomials ( and for certain random entire functions ) was stated by dennis and hanny in @xcite .",
    "they give a heuristic explanation for this pairing , which is similar in spirit to ours , but does not use that polynomials have a high multiplicity pole at infinity .",
    "we begin by explaining gauss s proof of the gauss - lucas theorem .",
    "suppose @xmath0 is a degree @xmath1 polynomial and @xmath29 are its zeros .",
    "the critical points of @xmath0 are solutions to @xmath30 a basic observation is that @xmath31 is the electric field at @xmath32 from a @xmath33 charge at @xmath34 the sum @xmath35 is therefore the complex conjugate of the total electric field @xmath36 at @xmath32 from positive point charges placed at each @xmath34 this means @xmath37 since all charges have the same sign , @xmath38 can not vanish outside of their convex hull . hence the gauss - lucas theorem .",
    "the preceeding argument relied very much on the particular coordinates on @xmath27 ( the convex hull is not a coordinate - free notion ) .",
    "however , the electrostatic interpretation of critical points can itself be done in a coordinate invariant way .",
    "we start by viewing @xmath0 as a meromorphic function on @xmath3 then @xmath39 where we ve written @xmath40 for the laplacian , and the equality is in the sense of distributions .",
    "this means that @xmath41 is a one - form that at any @xmath42 gives the ( complex conjugate of the ) electric field at @xmath43 from charge distributed according to @xmath44 gauss s choice of coordinates makes @xmath45 infinitely far way and and so the contribution to @xmath38 from the @xmath46 charges at infinity was zero . to get a true electric field",
    ", we need to covert @xmath38 to a vector field using a metric . however , the points where @xmath38 vanishes ( i.e. the critical point of @xmath0 ) are independent of such a choice .",
    "this point of view is closely related to the classical notion of a polar derivative of a complex polynomial @xcite , which can be used to prove some coordinate free versions of the gauss - lucas theorem such as laguerre s theorem @xcite . that it should imply a pairing of zeros and critical points never seems to have been observed , however .",
    "it is precisely the charge of size @xmath1 at @xmath45 that clarifies why zeros and critical points come in pairs . to see this ,",
    "let us consider the case of a degree @xmath1 polynomial @xmath47 that has a zero at a fixed point @xmath4 while its remaining zeros @xmath48 are chosen independently from the uniform measure @xmath2 on @xmath27 .",
    "we must explain why , with high probability , there is a point @xmath5 near @xmath9 at which the electric field @xmath49 vanishes .",
    "in the holomorphic coordinate @xmath43 centered at @xmath50 we have @xmath51 thus , @xmath52 the first term in is the contribution from the @xmath46 charges at @xmath50 while the second comes from the @xmath33 charge at @xmath9 , which is also of order @xmath1 if @xmath53 the third term is a sum of iid random variables .",
    "it is equal to zero on average ( cf ) .",
    "hence , heuristically , it is should be on the order of @xmath54 by the central limit theorem .",

    "note that the distance from @xmath43 to @xmath5 is on the order of @xmath10 the true critical point of @xmath0 will , by rouch s theorem , therefore be a small perturbation of @xmath61 note that @xmath5 is a bit farther away from @xmath45 than @xmath9 and hence is closer to @xmath58 as shown in figures 1 - 4 . the condition that @xmath57 is not an artifact of our reasoning .",
    "figures 1 - 4 clearly show the existence of regions where the pairing of critical points breaks down : at @xmath62 the contribution to @xmath38 from the charges at @xmath45 precisely cancels by symmetry .",

    "our main result , theorem [ t : scor ] , can be stated loosely as follows .",
    "consider a degree @xmath1 polynomial @xmath72 viewed as a meromorphic function on @xmath3 suppose @xmath0 has a zero at a fixed point @xmath73 while its other zeros are randomly and independently selected .",
    "then , we are likely to observe a critical point @xmath5 of @xmath0 a distance about @xmath6 away from @xmath9 .",
    "note that if we choose @xmath1 independent points at random from the uniform measure on @xmath74 then the typical spacing between nearest neighbors is on the order of @xmath75 which is much larger than the @xmath6 spacing between a zero and its paired critical point .",
    "observe also that theorem [ t : scor ] is genuinely probabilistic and does not hold for polynomials of the form @xmath76 .",
    "nonetheless , as explained in the introduction , multiplying @xmath77 by a single linear factor already makes the zeros and critical points of the resulting polynomial come in pairs ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "let us write @xmath78 for the space of polynomials of degree at most @xmath1 in one complex variable . since the zeros and critical points of @xmath79 are unchanged after multiplication by a non - zero constant , we study random the zeros and critical points of a random polynomial by putting a probability measure directly on the projectivization @xmath80 as follows .",

    "[ s : electrostatics ] for why zeros and critical points are paired used only that zeros are weakly correlated and spaced more than @xmath6 apart , however .",
    "this suggests that perhaps @xmath2 can be taken to be any measure satisfying a finite energy condition @xmath130 which rules out @xmath2 having an atom or being supported on a curve .",
    "the @xmath131 estimate from theorem [ t : scor ] is sharp in the sense that with probability on the order of @xmath6 there exists a @xmath132 so that @xmath133 such a zero will disrupt the local pairing of zeros and critical points .",
    "however , if one studies ensembles of polynomials for which zeros repel one another , then the @xmath134 estimates can be improved .",
    "for instance , in @xcite the author studied such ensembles and showed that the probability of pairing is like @xmath135 zeros will always repel for polynomials whose coefficients relative to a fixed basis are taken to be iid since the change of variables from coefficients to zeros involves a vandermonde determinant .",
    "it should therefore be possible to generalize the results in this paper to the case when zeros are distributed like a coulomb gas .",

    "so instead we estimate separately the fluctuations of @xmath159 and of @xmath160      to estimate @xmath159 we use that @xmath161 to throw away the contribution to @xmath159 coming from zeros that are far from @xmath9 ( and hence from @xmath43 and @xmath5 as well ) .",
