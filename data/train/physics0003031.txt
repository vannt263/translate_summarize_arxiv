    "the dissociation of methane on transition metals is an important reaction in catalysis .",
    "it is the rate limiting step in steam reforming to produce syngas.@xcite it is also prototypical for c  h activation in other processes .",
    "a large number of molecular beam experiments in which the dissociation energy was measured as a function of translational energy have already been done on this system.@xcite these experiments have contributed much to our understanding of the mechanism of the dissociation . some of them observed that vibrationally hot @xmath1 dissociates more readily than cold @xmath1 , with the energy in the internal vibrations being about as effective as the translational energy in inducing dissociation.@xcite a more detailed assessment of the importance of the internal vibrations could not be made , because of the large number of internal vibrations . a recent molecular beam experiment with laser excitation of the @xmath2 mode succeeded in measuring a dramatical enhancement of the dissociation on a ni(100 ) surface , but it is still much too low to account for the vibrational activation observed in previous studies and indicates that other vibrationally excited modes contribute significantly to the reactivity of thermal samples.@xcite    wavepacket simulations are being used more and more to study the dynamics of this kind of molecule surface reactions .",
    "the published wavepacket simulations on the methane dissociation reaction on transition metals have treated the methane molecule always as a diatomic up to now.@xcite besides the c  h bond and molecule surface distance , a combination of other coordinates were included , like ( multiple ) rotations and some lattice motion .",
    "none of them have looked at the role of the internal vibrations .",
    "various theoretical studies have obtained reaction pathways and barriers for dissociation by dft calculations,@xcite but they can not explain the role of the vibrational modes in the reaction dynamics either .    a nice way to study reaction dynamics",
    "is the use of isotopes .",
    "the most recent wavepacket simulation on the dissociation probability of ch@xmath0 and cd@xmath0 showed a semiquantitative agreement with the molecular beam experiments of ref.@xcite , except for the isotope effect and the extracted vibrational efficacy.@xcite the molecular beam study with laser excitation of the @xmath2 asymmetrical stretch mode shows that the incorrect vibrational efficacy is caused by the assumptions in the fit procedure that both stretch modes behaves identical.@xcite one of the possible explanation of the incorrect isotope effect can be the role played by the non - included intramolecular vibrations .    in a previous paper we reported on wavepacket simulations that we have done to determine which and to what extent internal vibrations are important for the dissociation of ch@xmath0.@xcite we were not able yet to simulate the dissociation including all internal vibrations .",
    "instead we simulated the scattering of methane , for which all internal vibrations can be included , and used the results to deduce consequences for the dissociation .",
    "we used model potential energy surfaces ( pess ) that have been developed with ni(111 ) in mind , but our results should hold for other surfaces as well . at a translational energy up to 96 kj / mol we found that the scattering is almost completely elastic .",
    "vibrational excitations when the molecule hits the surface and the corresponding deformation depend on generic features of the potential energy surface .",
    "in particular , our simulations indicate that for methane to dissociate the interaction of the molecule with the surface should lead to an elongated equilibrium c  h bond length close to the surface .",
    "we have been using the multiconfigurational time - dependent hartree ( mctdh ) method for our wavepacket simulation , because it can deal with a large number of degrees of freedom and with large grids.@xcite this method has been applied successfully to gas phase reactions and reactions at surfaces.@xcite    in this paper we report wavepacket simulations of cd@xmath0 scattering including all internal vibrations for fixed orientations , performed on the same model pess as in our previous paper.@xcite translational motion parallel to the surface and all rotational motion was neglected .",
    "no degrees of freedom of the surface were included .",
    "experiments show that coupling with these degrees of freedom is dependent on the metal surface .",
    "for example , the observed surface temperature effect are small on ni@xcite , but quite large on pt@xcite .",
    "as we are only interested in the role of internal vibrations , we have not included degrees of freedom of the surface to keep the simulations as simple as possible .",
    "we will discuss the vibrational excitation and the deformation of the cd@xmath0 molecule when it hits the surface and compare it with ch@xmath0 .",
    "later on we will look at the energy distribution of the kinetic energy per mode and the potential energy in some terms of the pes with the elongated equilibrium bond length close to the surface for both isotopes .",
    "the transfer of translational kinetic energy towards vibrational kinetic energy gives an indication about the dissociation probability , since vibrational kinetic energy helps in overcoming the dissociation barrier .",
    "it gives a better idea too about which modes are essential to include in a more accurate wavepacket simulation of methane dissociation .",
    "after that we will discuss the implications of this for the dissociation and give a summary with some general conclusions .",
    "we used for the scattering of cd@xmath0 the same model pess as we did for ch@xmath0 .",
    "since we expressed the pes in mass - weighted coordinated the parameters in the pess for cd@xmath0 differs from ch@xmath0 .",
    "we will now give an overview of our model pess and the corresponding parameters for cd@xmath0 .",
    "the parameters of ch@xmath0 for these pess were already given in ref .",
    "@xcite , where also more detailed information about our assumptions and contour plots of some cross - section of the model pess can be found .",
    "the pess we used can all be written as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the intramolecular pes and @xmath5 is the repulsive interaction with the surface . for the @xmath4",
    "we looked at four different types of pess .",
    "the @xmath4 include also for two types changes in the intramolecular potential due to interactions with the surface .",
    "the first one is completely harmonic .",
    "we have used normal mode coordinates for the internal vibrations , because these are coupled only very weakly . in the harmonic approximation",
    "this coupling is even absent so that we can write @xmath4 as @xmath6 the summation is over the internal vibrations , @xmath7 s are mass - weighted displacement coordinates and @xmath8 are mass - weighted force constants .",

    "also the same configurational basis was used for both isotopes .",
    "we did the simulation with one bond pointing towards the surface in eight dimensions , because the @xmath71 bending modes @xmath21 and @xmath32 do not couple with the other modes .",

    "we needed ten dimensions to perform the simulation with three bonds pointing towards the surface .",
    "we used here one natural single - particle state for the modes @xmath21 to @xmath22 and four natural single - particle states for @xmath16 to @xmath18 , which gave us @xmath76 configurations .",
    "the scattering probabilities for cd@xmath0 are predominantly elastic , as we also found in our previous simulations of ch@xmath0 scattering.@xcite the elastic scattering probability is larger than 0.99 for all orientation of the pess with @xmath45 and @xmath77 at a translational energy of 96 kj / mol . for the pes with @xmath73 we observe an elastic scattering probability of 0.981 for the orientation with one , 0.955 with two and 0.892 with three deuteriums pointing towards the surface .",
    "this is lower than we have found for ch@xmath0 , which is 0.956 for the orientation with three hydrogens pointing towards the surface and larger than 0.99 for the others .",
    "the higher inelastic scattering probabilities of cd@xmath0 was expected , because the force constants @xmath8 of cd@xmath0 are decreased up to 50% with respect to those of ch@xmath0 and the translational surface repulsion fall - off differs only little .",
    "when we look at the excitation probabilities at the surface for the pes with @xmath45 and @xmath78 , then we observe generally an increase for cd@xmath0 compared with ch@xmath0 , except for the @xmath41 umbrella mode in the orientation with two bond pointing towards the surface .",
    "relevant differences in the structure deformations are observed only in the bond angles , which are increased for cd@xmath0 in the orientations with one and three bonds pointing towards the surface .",
    "the bond angle deformation of the angle between the bonds pointing towards the surface in the orientation with two bonds pointing towards the surface is decreased for cd@xmath0 .",
    "we observe again that the pes with @xmath78 gives larger structure deformations than the pes with @xmath45 , but the differences are smaller for cd@xmath0 than ch@xmath0 .    for the pes with @xmath73 we do not observe this effect on the bond angle deformation .",
    "the bond angle deformation for the orientation with two and three deuteriums pointing towards the surface is the same as for ch@xmath0 and it is just @xmath79 less for the bond angle at the surface side in the orientation with one deuterium pointing towards the surface .",
    "the excitation probabilities ( see table [ tab : exprop ] ) for the @xmath71 bending and @xmath41 umbrella modes become higher for all orientations for cd@xmath0 , which is necessary for getting the same bond angle deformations as ch@xmath0 .",
    "the changes in the bond distances for the orientations with one and two bonds pointing towards the surface is for cd@xmath0 almost the same as for ch@xmath0 .",
    "for the orientation with three bonds pointing towards the surface , we found that the maximum bond lengthening of the bonds on the surface side was @xmath80  less for cd@xmath0 than ch@xmath0 .",
    "we also found that the bond shortening of the bond pointing away from the surface is @xmath81  more for cd@xmath0 .",
    "these are only minimal differences , which also only suggest that the bond deformation for cd@xmath0 has been influenced slightly more by the @xmath2 asymmetrical stretch mode than the @xmath72 symmetrical stretch mode .",
    "the observed excitation probabilities for these modes do not contradict this , but are not reliable enough for hard conclusions because of their high magnitude .",
    "it is also not clear , beside of this problem , what they really represent .",
    "is the excitation caused by a different equilibrium position of the pes at the surface in a mode or is it caused by extra energy in this mode ? to answer these questions we decided to do an energy distribution analysis during the scattering for both isotopes .",
    "the energy distribution analysis is performed by calculating the expectation values of the important term of the hamiltonian @xmath82 for the wave - function @xmath83 at a certain time @xmath84 during the scattering of cd@xmath0 and ch@xmath0 for all presented orientations in this and our previous paper.@xcite we will present here only the results of the pes with @xmath73 , because it is the only model pes for which the energy distribution analysis is relevant for the discussion of the dissociation hypotheses later on .",
    "we can obtain good information about the energy distribution per mode by looking at the kinetic energy expectation values @xmath85 per mode @xmath86 ( see table [ tab : kinch4 ] ) , because the kinetic energy operators @xmath87 have no cross terms like the pess have .",
    "when we discuss the kinetic energy of a mode we normally refer to the @xmath19 mode of the c@xmath20 or c@xmath26 symmetry , because in these modes we have observed the highest excitation probabilities and the change in kinetic energy in the other modes is generally small .    by looking at the expectation values of some terms of the pes @xmath88 ( see table [ tab : potch4 ] ) , we obtain information about how the kinetics of the scattering is driven by the pes . the @xmath5 pes [ see eqs .",
    "( [ vsurfone ] ) , ( [ vsurftwo ] ) and ( [ vsurfthree ] ) ] is the surface hydrogen / deuterium repulsion for a given orientation . @xmath89 and",
    "@xmath90 [ see eq .",
    "( [ vharm ] ) ] are the pure harmonic terms of the intramolecular pes of the @xmath19 modes in the c@xmath20 and c@xmath26 symmetry corresponding to a @xmath71 bending and @xmath41 umbrella modes , respectively .",
    "the pure harmonic correction terms of @xmath44 [ see eq .",
    "( [ vintra_morse ] ) ] are included in them . @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the potential energy in a single c ",
    "h or c  d bond pointing respectively towards and away from the surface , and they give the expectation value of one bond term of @xmath73 [ see eq .",
    "( [ vshift_d ] ) ] .",
    "all given expectation values are the maximum deviation of the initial values , which effectively means the values at the moment the molecule hits the surface .",
    "the largest changes in expectation values are , of course , in the kinetic energy of the translational mode .",
    "the translational kinetic energy does not become zero as we should expect in classical dynamics .",
    "the loss of translational kinetic energy is primary absorbed by the @xmath5 terms of the pess .",
    "the expectation values of the @xmath93 terms show the ability of the hydrogens or deuteriums to come close to the metal surface , since in real space their exponential fall - offs are the same for both isotopes . for a rigid molecule",
    "the sum of the translational kinetic energy and @xmath5 should be constant , so all deviations of this sum have to be found back in the intramolecular kinetic energy and other pes terms .",
    "we observe that both the minimum in the translational kinetic energy and the maximum in the @xmath5 terms were higher for ch@xmath0 than cd@xmath0 , so we have to find more increase in energy in the intramolecular modes and pes terms for cd@xmath0 than ch@xmath0 .",
    "we indeed do so and that can be one of the reasons we found higher inelastic scatter probabilities for cd@xmath0 for the pes with @xmath73 .    for the orientations with one and two bonds pointing towards the surface we observe a large increase of the kinetic energy in the @xmath2 asymmetrical stretch mode . if we compare this with the excitation probabilities , we find that the kinetic energy analysis gives indeed a different view on the dynamics . for the orientation with two bond pointing towards the surface we have found for both isotopes very high excitation probabilities in the @xmath72 and @xmath2 stretch modes .",
    "we know now from the kinetic energy distribution that for the @xmath72 symmetrical stretch mode the high excitation probability is caused by the change of the equilibrium position of the @xmath72 mode in the pes and that for the @xmath2 stretch mode probably the pes also has become narrower .    for the orientation with three bonds pointing towards the surface we also obtain an large increase of the kinetic energy of the @xmath2 asymmetrical stretch mode , but we also find an even larger increase in the kinetic energy of the @xmath72 symmetrical stretch mode .",
    "the total kinetic energy was extremely large , because the kinetic energy of the translational mode becomes also much larger than for the other orientations . because of this the @xmath5 terms had to be around twice as low as for the other orientations .",
    "all @xmath91 terms become lower compared to the initial value , especially in the orientation with two bond pointing towards the surface . in the orientation with one bond pointing towards the surface ,",
    "the @xmath94 term became higher .",
    "this is caused by the repulsion of @xmath5 in the direction of the bond .",
    "the increase of this pes term value is higher for cd@xmath0 than ch@xmath0 .    in the orientation with three bond pointing towards the surface",
    "we also observe a higher @xmath92 value , with also the highest increase for cd@xmath0 . in relation with the somewhat shorter bond distance for the @xmath95 of cd@xmath0 compared with ch@xmath0 , which was also a bit lower compared with the other orientations , we know now that the hydrogens and especially the deuterium have problems in following the minimum energy path of the pes with @xmath73 during the scattering dynamics .",
    "this leads to higher kinetic energy in the vibrational modes , which results in more inelastic scattering .",
    "the @xmath89 term increases in respect to the initial value , but not as much as the increase of the @xmath90 is for the orientation with two bonds pointing towards the surface .",
    "the values of @xmath90 for cd@xmath0 are even higher than for ch@xmath0 .",
    "we observe also a larger increase of the kinetic energy in the @xmath41 umbrella mode for cd@xmath0 than for ch@xmath0 .",
    "so although there is somewhat more energy transfer to the vibrational modes for cd@xmath0 than ch@xmath0 , this extra vibrational energy is absorbed especially in the @xmath41 umbrella mode of cd@xmath0 .",
    "we like now to discuss some possible implications of the scattering simulation for the isotope effect on the dissociation of methane . in our previous paper",
    "we have already drawn some conclusions about the possible reaction mechanism and which potential type would be necessary for dissociation.@xcite we found the direct breaking of a single c ",
    "h bond in the initial collision more reasonable than the splats model with single bond breaking after an intermediary ni ",
    "c bond formation as suggested by ref .",
    "@xcite , because the bond angle deformations seems to small to allow a ni ",
    "c to form . from the simulations with cd@xmath0",
    "we can draw the same conclusions .",
    "the pes with @xmath73 gives the same angle deformations for both isotopes , which is not sufficient for the splats model .",
    "the other potentials give higher bond angle deformations for the orientation with three deuteriums pointing towards the surface . if the ni ",
    "c bond formation would go along this reaction path , then the dissociation of cd@xmath0 should be even more preferable than ch@xmath0 , which is not the case .",
    "so we only have to discuss the implication of the scattering simulation for the dissociation probabilities of ch@xmath0 and cd@xmath0 for a direct breaking of a single bond reaction mechanism .",
    "this reaction mechanism can be influenced by what we will call a direct or an indirect effect .",
    "a direct effects is the expected changes in the dissociation probability between ch@xmath0 and cd@xmath0 for a given orientation . since we expect that we need for dissociation a pes with an elongation of the bonds pointing towards the surface , we only have to look at the isotope effect in the simulation for the pes with @xmath73 for different orientations to discuss some direct effect .",
    "it is clear from our simulations that the bond lengthening of cd@xmath0 is smaller than ch@xmath0 for the orientation with three bonds pointing towards the surface . if this orientation has a high contribution to the dissociation of methane , then this can be the reason of the higher dissociation probability of ch@xmath0 . in this case",
    "our simulations also explain why ref.@xcite did not observe a high enough isotope effect in the dissociation probability of their simulation with ch@xmath0 and cd@xmath0 modelled by a diatomic , because we do not observe a change in bond lengthening between the isotopes for the orientation with one bond pointing towards the surface .",
    "the orientation with three bonds pointing towards the surface is also the orientation with the highest increase of the total vibrational kinetic energy for the pes with @xmath73 , because the energy distribution analysis shows besides an high increase of the kinetic energy in the @xmath2 asymmetrical stretch mode also an high increase in the @xmath72 symmetrical stretch mode . since vibrational kinetic energy can be used effectively to overcome the dissociation barrier , the orientation with three bonds indicates to be a more preferable orientation for dissociation .",
    "moreover the relative difference in kinetic energy between both isotopes is for the @xmath72 stretch mode larger than for the @xmath2 stretch mode . if the kinetic energy in the @xmath72 stretch mode contributes significantly to overcoming the dissociation barrier , then it is another explanation for the low isotope effect in ref.@xcite .",
    "an indirect effect is the expected changes in the dissociation probability between ch@xmath0 and cd@xmath0 through changes in the orientations distribution caused by the isotope effect in the vibrational modes",
    ". this can be the case if the favourable orientation for dissociation is not near the orientation with three bonds pointing towards the surface , but more in a region where one or two bonds pointing towards the surface .",
    "these orientations do not show a large difference in deformation for the pes with @xmath73 .",
    "we can not draw immediate conclusion about the indirect effect from our simulations , since we did not include rotational motion , but our simulation show that an indirect isotope effect can exist .",
    "for the pes with @xmath45 in the orientation with three bonds pointing towards the surface , we observe that cd@xmath0 is able to come closer to the surface than ch@xmath0 .",
    "so this rotational orientation should be more preferable for cd@xmath0 than for ch@xmath0 .",
    "on the other hand , if the pes is in this orientation more like @xmath73 the dissociation probability in other orientation can be decreased for cd@xmath0 through higher probability in inelastic scattering channels .",
    "so for both effects the behaviour of the orientation with three bonds pointing towards the surface seems to be essential for a reasonable description of the dissociation mechanism of methane .",
    "a wavepacket simulation of methane scattering including one or more rotational degrees of freedom and the vibrational stretch modes will be a good starting model to study the direct and indirect effects , since most of the kinetic energy changes are observed in the stretch modes and so the bending and umbrella modes are only relevant with accurate pess .",
    "eventually dissociation paths can be introduced in the pes along one or more bonds .    beside of our descriptions of the possible isotopes effect for the dissociation extracted of the scatter simulations we have to keep in mind that also a tunneling mechanism can be highly responsible for the higher observed isotope effect in the experiment and that a different dissociation barrier in the simulations can enhance this effect of tunneling .",

    "the pes with an elongated equilibrium bond length close to the surface gives for both isotopes almost the same deformations , although we observe a somewhat smaller bond lengthening for cd@xmath0 in the orientation with three bonds pointing towards the surface .",
    "the other model pess show differences in the bond angle deformations and in the distribution of the excitation probabilities of cd@xmath0 and ch@xmath0 , especially for the pes with only an anharmonic intramolecular potential .",
    "energy distribution analysis contributes new information on the scattering dynamics . a higher transfer of translational energy towards vibrational kinetic energy at the surface results in higher inelastic scattering .",
    "the highest increase of vibrational kinetic energy is found in the @xmath2 asymmetrical stretch modes for all orientations and also in the @xmath72 symmetrical stretch mode for the orientation with three bonds pointing towards the surface , when the pes has an elongated equilibrium bond length close to the surface .",
    "our simulations give an indication that the isotope effect in the methane dissociation is caused mostly by the difference in the scattering behaviour of the molecule in the orientation with three bonds pointing towards the surface .",
    "at least multiple vibrational stretch modes should be included for a reasonable description of isotope effect in the methane dissociation reaction .",
