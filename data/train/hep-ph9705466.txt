    "the study of qcd in the high energy limit has a history spanning at least twenty years and is still actively pursued .",
    "within perturbation theory ( pqcd ) an understanding has emerged concerning hadronic processes in the semihard regime , such as near - forward elastic and diffractive scattering , small-@xmath0 deeply inelastic scattering and rapidity gap events .",
    "the evolution of the partonic cascade stemming from the initial state hadrons is known to be described in the leading logarithmic approximation lla(x ) by the bfkl equation either in its original form @xcite or in its improved reformulations @xcite . however , the picture is yet incomplete because of two major problems encountered in this regime .",
    "the first has to do with unitarity @xcite , which is violated by the lla(x ) result .",
    "the second concerns the infrared sensitivity of the lla(x ) result , which is infrared finite but does receive contributions from low momentum regions , where physical observables are sensitive to large non - perturbative corrections .",
    "it is the second problem that we shall consider in this paper .    unlike the more conventional high momentum transfer ( @xmath8 ) processes with final state particles in the central rapidity region ,",
    "the semihard kinematic regime is characterised by three ordered scales , @xmath9 .",
    "note that the use of pqcd is justified by the second of the previous inequalities , in the absence of which , regge phenomenology of soft processes is the only available approach so far .",
    "the pqcd factorisation theorem , applicable for high-@xmath8 processes , states that inclusive observables can be expressed as a product of parton distribution functions and a hard scattering cross section ( matrix elements and coefficient function in ope parlance ) . in the semihard regime",
    "this theorem needs amendment . here",
    ", the product is not only a convolution in longitudinal momentum fractions of the partons but also in their transverse momentum .",
    "this is known as @xmath10-factorisation @xcite and in impact parameter space it translates to a convolution in impact parameter of the radiated secondary partons and an off - shell hard amplitude or cross section .",
    "this leads us to the first of the two theoretical inputs of the present study , namely the use of the impact parameter or dipole emission formulation of semihard processes , as developed by mueller @xcite and independently by nikolaev and zakharov @xcite .",
    "the merit of this formalism , apart from the simplicity of the final results , is that it organises the process in terms of sequential soft gluon emissions in the @xmath11-channel , which in the coulomb gauge admit a clear physical interpretation .",
    "they are to be understood as initial state radiation occurring before the hard scattering .",
    "final state interactions are not included in the evolution equation because they only lead to a unitarity rearrangement that does not affect inclusive observables .",
    "to study the infrared sensitivity of a semihard process we are bound to consider a subset of next - to - leading logarithmic corrections , specifically the ones that have to do with the running coupling . in the bfkl approach , the evolution kernel , although infrared finite , is sensitive to the running coupling because of diffusion towards the infrared of the transverse momentum along the exchanged gluon ladder . with specific assumptions about the infrared dynamics ( i.e. long wavelength gluon propagation ) and the scale of the running coupling , the effect on the regge trajectories has been analyzed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the present study",
    "we take the point of view that in the dipole formalism , just like in timelike parton cascades , the scale of the running coupling is set by the virtuality of the emitted gluon .",
    "the problem of translating this into impact parameter space is resolved through the use of the borel transformation .",
    "we require that the dipole evolution kernel has the same borel singularity structure as the one obtained in momentum space .",
    "this condition is sufficient to determine the scale of the coupling as a function of the impact parameters of the emitted gluon .",
    "therefore , the second theoretical input in our approach is renormalon analysis @xcite . once the dipole kernel with running coupling",
    "is constructed , we study the power corrections that are generated when this kernel is used to evolve the wave function of an initial hadronic state such as a virtual photon in small-@xmath0 d.i.s .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we highlight the main concepts and results of the dipole formalism . here",
    "we also review the derivation of the dipole evolution equation with running coupling . in section 3",
    "we discuss the borel singularity structure of the dipole density .",
    "we find a series of infrared renormalon singularities at @xmath12 , @xmath13 as well as a leading singularity at @xmath14 , with @xmath15 the anomalous dimension of the solution .",
    "we show that the borel image of the dipole kernel is analytic in the neighbourhood of @xmath2 and compute its action as a power series expansion in @xmath3 . in the limit @xmath16",
    "the bfkl result is recovered .",
    "iterations of the kernel turn the renormalon poles into branch cuts but do not shift their positions . in section 4",
    "we discuss small-@xmath0 d.i.s . in the dipole formalism using the results derived previously .",
    "the main conclusion is that the leading borel singularity is at @xmath17 , which implies @xmath5 power corrections consistent with the wilson ope expectation .",
    "the dipole evolution equation for fixed coupling can be solved by virtue of its scale invariance and leads to the same spectrum as that of the bfkl equation . for the borel image",
    "this scale invariance is necessarily lost and the resulting evolution equation can only be solved in numerical approximation by successive iterations . in section 5",
    "we present results for the first few iterations of the borel transformed kernel in deeply inelastic scattering , and demonstrate that the singularity conforms with that discussed in section 4 .",
    "we summarise in the final section .",
    "we consider small-@xmath0 d.i.s . as a specific example of a semihard process and",
    "describe it in the rest frame of the nucleon target of mass @xmath18 .",

    "we can formulate the problem of the borel singularities of the small-@xmath0 structure functions as follows .",
    "the borel image of the structure functions is given by @xmath220 where @xmath221 is a solution to the evolution equation @xmath222 with kernel given in eq .",
    "( [ runker ] ) and boundary condition @xmath223    in the previous section we studied the action of the kernel @xmath224 on the test functions @xmath104 , see eqs .",
    "( [ chidef ] , [ chiform ] ) . then these functions where used as a basis for decomposing the dipole density in terms of the spectral amplitudes , eq .",
    "( [ anomdim ] ) , and we observed that this leads to @xmath118-dependent ir renormalons . if this procedure were applicable for constructing the structure functions @xmath225 it would yield a leading ir renormalon at @xmath226 , which could be to the left of unity for some @xmath227 , corresponding to power corrections of @xmath228 with @xmath229",
    ". this would be in contradiction with the standard ope expansion of the structure functions , which predicts leading power corrections of @xmath230 , coming from the next - to - leading twist operators .    in the case at hand such",
    "a contradiction does not arise for the following reason .",
    "we have noted that ir renormalon singularities come from the integration region @xmath231 in eq .",
    "( [ dipevol ] ) , i.e. from emission at large impact parameters .",
    "this means that in eq .",
    "( [ evsigma ] ) we are sampling large values of @xmath232 .",
    "although @xmath233 can not be calculated in pqcd it is controlled by a nucleon wavefunction which is suppressed at large @xmath232 , indicating that the probability to find a sufficiently large primary dipole inside a nucleon is negligible .",
    "we can model @xmath207 ( as we shall do in the next section ) by assuming that it has the same asymptotic impact parameter dependence as that of a virtual photon and mass scale @xmath234 .",
    "such a functional form , see eq .",
    "( [ asyk ] ) , can not be decomposed in the @xmath104 basis .",
    "we emphasise that this does not mean that ir renormalons do not arise from real emission .",
    "it means that the leading ir renormalon is anticipated at @xmath235 leading to @xmath236 corrections consistent with the wilson ope expectation .",
    "we conclude this section with the following remarks .",
    "the conventional ( or wilson ) ope expansion for large @xmath8 can not be used for small-@xmath0 resummation , as we noted in the introduction .",
    "semihard processes involve two large scales and a generalisation of the wilson ope is required .",
    "such an expansion would not only separate soft from hard particles but also high rapidity from low rapidity ones .",
    "this type of formalism has been brought to a considerable degree of maturity by balitsky in ref .",
    "@xcite , although it is still far from the point of being a computational algorithm , like wilson s ope . in the high energy ope ,",
    "evolution equations are non - linear beyond the lla(x ) approximation , whereas eq .",
    "( [ dipevol ] ) is linear .",
    "this is because our evolution equation does not resum the full set of the next - to - leading logarithms of @xmath237 but only a subset that involves the running of the coupling .",
    "hence , our solution is not expected to be unitary but it will parametrise sensitivity with respect to low transverse scales .",
    "in this section we demonstrate by numerical means that the borel transform of a deeply inelastic scattering structure function is regular in the region @xmath238 and has a singularity at @xmath239 .    in perturbation theory we can not calculate the cross section @xmath207 of eq .",
    "( [ sigmabc ] ) for electron - proton scattering .",
    "nevertheless we know that it must be controlled by the nucleon wave function , which vanishes rapidly ( assumed exponentially ) for sufficiently large impact parameter . a reasonable model , therefore , is to take the impact factor dependence calculated for the virtual photon , eq .",
    "( [ phi0 ] ) . for the realistic case of d.i.s .",
    "this is indeed a model , whereas if we were considering the scattering of two virtual photons ( onium - onium scattering ) then this would be exact , up to a factor arising from the integration over the longitudinal momentum fraction , @xmath24 , in the wavefunction of the target photon .",
    "we require that the model nucleon wave function be normalisable and this leads us to choose the case of a longitudinal virtual photon since for the transverse photon the behaviour of the wave function for small impact parameter gives rise to an ultraviolet divergence associated with the photon wave function renormalisation .",
    "the scale @xmath209 in eq .",
    "( [ phi0 ] ) is set to a typical hadron scale of @xmath240  gev . to this end",
    "we set the borel transform of @xmath241 in eqs .",
    "( [ sigman ] , [ sigmabc ] ) to @xmath242 we consider this modeling of the dipole - nucleon cross section to be appropriate for studying the ir effects arising from emission and subsequent interaction of large size dipoles .",
    "note that , as stated in the previous section , the large @xmath23 asymptotics of the @xmath20 wave function , which simulates the nucleon target here , is independent of polarisation .",
    "so our choice of @xmath243 bessel function in the previous equation is convenient and plausible .",
    "the form of the input functions prevent an analytic solution to eq .",
    "( [ evsigma ] ) from being found so we perform the integrations over @xmath86 , @xmath232 and the convolution in @xmath120 numerically using standard quadrature methods .",
    "more precisely we expand @xmath244 so as to bring the evolution equation in the form @xmath245 the first convolution of the kernel with the longitudinal input function , @xmath246 exhibits the structure we expect from section 4 , see fig .",
    "( [ conv_1_b ] ) .",
    "we observe that the leftmost singularity in the borel plane appears at @xmath247 and we identify this as the leading ir renormalon .",
    "there is no evidence of any singular behaviour in the region @xmath248 which would have been in contradiction with the ope expectation .",
    "no singularity emerges as @xmath16 either , due to the cancellation between real and virtual parts of the kernel as discussed in section 3 . on the other hand ,",
    "the expected leading singularity at @xmath249 can be seen clearly from the right hand graph of fig .",
    "( [ conv_1_b ] ) . for the first iteration of the borel transformed kernel ,",
    "this singularity occurs as a pole and it is generated entirely by the virtual correction contribution to @xmath250 .",
    "there is a distinct difference between the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath251 and @xmath252 as @xmath253 , fig .",
    "( [ conv_0_1_x ] ) . whereas @xmath251 decays exponentially at large @xmath254 , eq .",
    "( [ asyk ] ) , the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath252 is : @xmath255 examination of the kernel reveals that @xmath250 scales as @xmath256 at large @xmath257 and this is the scaling behaviour which dominates in the convolution to determine the behaviour of @xmath258 . for intermediate values of @xmath254 , the data obtained can be fitted accurately if we include logarithmic correction terms and we find @xmath259 where @xmath260 , @xmath261 and @xmath262 are fit parameters .",
    "this fit is exhibited in fig .",
    "( [ conv_0_1_x ] ) .    in section 4 , we demonstrated that the exponential nature of @xmath263 at large @xmath254 was responsible for the borel singularity structure observed in the first convolution .",
    "the power like behaviour of @xmath264 at large @xmath254 does not imply that new singularities will appear in the borel plane to the left of @xmath247 .",
    "it is the action of the convolution in @xmath120 in each subsequent iteration which guarantees this . for large @xmath232 , the convolution integral scales as @xmath265 from the kernel , @xmath266 from the behaviour of @xmath267 and",
    "the integration introduces a factor of @xmath23 ; the result being that the second convolution also exhibits a power dependence of the form given in eq .",
    "( [ asyiter1 ] ) for large @xmath23 .",
    "indeed this large @xmath23 behaviour is sufficient to predict the position of the leading borel plane singularity for subsequent iterations .",
    "since the infrared singularities are determined by the infrared ( large @xmath23 ) behaviour of the function on which the kernel acts , we can consider @xmath268 then , from eq .",
    "( [ chiform ] ) we see that @xmath269 has a leading singularity at @xmath247 , which is where the leading singularity will be found for _ all _ subsequent iterations .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "( [ conv_2_b ] ) .",
    "we also note that the convolution in @xmath3 leads to a linear fall off as @xmath270 . for further iterations of the kernel",
    "it is the intermediate @xmath271 range which will be of most significance .",
    "although the leading singularity occurs again at @xmath247 as expected from the discussion above , the shape of the distribution is broader .",
    "this is because for the second and subsequent iterations the leading singularity is converted into a cut with branch point at @xmath272 and receives singular contributions from both the virtual correction and real emission part of the kernel .",
    "the generation of each iteration is a numerically intensive task . after generating a sufficient number of iterations",
    ", we will be in a position to solve eq .",
    "( [ d3 ] ) and construct the structure functions numerically . as explained above , we do not expect the position of the leading singularity to shift .",
    "however , the behaviour of the wave function in the vicinity of the singularity contains important information about the contribution to structure functions from the infrared regions of transverse momentum space . we will report on findings for the structure functions in a future publication",
    "although there exist numerous parametrisations of experimental data for semihard processes that include non - perturbative effects in plausible ways , here we have attempted to study in a systematic fashion the emergence of non - perturbative corrections as signaled by perturbation theory itself . for small-@xmath0 d.i.s .",
    "we have worked within the dipole cascade formalism and introduced the running coupling in a self - consistent way . to study the resulting loss of scale invariance we considered the dipole evolution equation in borel ( @xmath3 ) space .",
    "the variable @xmath3 provides a measure of deviation from the conformal limit @xmath2 , where we have shown that the evolution equation reproduces the well known bfkl result .",
    "we have identified the borel singularities of the dipole density and have studied how these singularities change once the dipole density is convoluted with the dipole - nucleon cross section . in this case the evolution equation generates leading singularity which is a branch cut at @xmath247 .",
    "this was established by numerical calculation for d.i.s . at small @xmath0 .",
    "such a singularity indicates the presence of @xmath5 power corrections to the small-@xmath0 structure functions coming from the emission of dipoles of large transverse size .",
    "these correspond to ` ladder gluons ' of small transverse momentum in the bfkl formalism .",
    "hence our approach is suitable for studying the region of diffusion of transverse momentum towards the infrared .",
    "moreover , it would be interesting to see how the scale dependence of the interactions in the dipole cascade modify the dependence of the structure functions on @xmath237 .",
