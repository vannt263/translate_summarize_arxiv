    "b , this experiment results in essentially the same ar gate and bias dispersion as when measured between an n and the s contact ( fig .",
    "[ fig : abs - b - characterization ] ) , whereas for device c we find additional curved resonances at higher energies ( cf .",
    "[ fig : abs - c - characterization ] ) .",
    "we note that the ars are centered around zero bias , which suggests a negligible change in the electrical potential of s.    the experiments on devices b and c are straight forward to understand qualitatively based on our previous picture of abss : we assumed that the cnt segment between n1 and n2 forms a qd in the normal state of s. in the superconducting state , the eigenstates of the segment develop into abss that determine all subgap transport .",
    "if s is at a fixed potential , it can take up ( or emit ) cooper pairs , which allows cooper pair splitting as a process and , in unison with resonant abs tunneling , results in the pattern of positive and negative differential conductance .",
    "if s is floating , the experiments show that @xmath253 , since the ars are centered around zero bias . since cps and the local andreev processes both add charges to s , which would change the electrical ( though not the chemical ) potential of s",

    "additional features and different amplitudes compared to the traditional ars are to be expected , since here only electrons at one energy are involved .",
    "the interpretation of the experiments on device a are more problematic .",
    "we find in the conductance between n1 and n2 the standard qd resonances when s is floating , while if s is at a fixed potential modulated by the ac voltage , abs signatures occur simultaneously with the standard qd features , see fig .",

    "we only find abs related signals .",
    "we note that both , the coulomb diamonds and the ars , are not offset in bias , suggesting that the cnt segment is at zero potential .",
    "these experiments seem quite contradictory , since one would expect that the eigenstates of the s - qd system do not depend on the boundary conditions of the measurement . as discussed for samples b and c , the different processes are sensitive to different boundary conditions , but simultaneous observation of standard coulomb blockade and abs features",
    "can not be resolved with such arguments alone .",
    "this suggests that our picture of abs mediated transport is not complete and only holds for a strong enough coupling to s. in this picture we assume that the qd develops new eigenstates due to the coupling to the unperturbed superconductor .",
    "one might expect that a continuous lowering of the coupling strengths results in a continuous transition from the abs to the bare qd states .",
    "our results , however , seem to suggest that in some parameter regime both sets of states are available for different transport processes .",
    "we speculate that for low enough @xmath0 the tunneling of an electron on and off the qd from n terminals is faster than the exchange of cooper pairs with s , which is necessary for the hybridization of the qd with s. right after the first tunneling event the system is in the state @xmath17 , which is a coherent superposition of the system eigenstates @xmath18 and @xmath254 , i.e. , @xmath255 ( @xmath256 ) .",
    "therefore we expect coherent oscillations between @xmath19 and @xmath17 in an abs excited by single electron tunneling events , with a characteristic frequency essentially determined by @xmath0 .",
    "this oscillation is expected to result in a suppression of the waiting time distribution for short times,@xcite and might be responsible for our findings here : in a three - terminal device an excitation can not only be absorbed by forming a cooper pair , as in a two - terminal device , but also by tunneling out into the third terminal ( resonant abs tunneling ) .",
    "if this happens faster than half a coherent oscillation , the tunneling electron stays in the bare qd state during the time it resides on the cnt segment . assuming that an oscillation by half a period is required to transfer a cooper pair to s , we find the relation @xmath257 as a necessary condition to observe the bare qd resonances , in good agreement with device a , but not for the other two devices with considerably larger @xmath0 and a faster oscillation rate relative to @xmath258 .",
    "our results demonstrate that a three - terminal qd can give access to the fast electron dynamics , in our example of the abs coherent oscillations with frequencies @xmath259 in the range between @xmath260ghz ( device a ) to @xmath261ghz ( device b ) , by the implicit comparison of the tunnel rates to the third terminal .",
    "in summary , we investigate electronic transport mediated by andreev bound states in a three - terminal s - qd device and identify the coupling to the normal metal leads as the main source for the spectroscopic broadening of the andreev resonances , and establish how the coupling to the superconductor determines the ground state of the system . in addition , we present ` excited state andreev resonances ' at higher energies , with transitions between abss and odd parity excited qd states .",
    "we also report pronounced sign changes in the abs - mediated transport between the two normal metal contacts , which we explain in an intuitive rate equation model as resulting from the competition between the nonlocal creation of a cooper pair in s and the new process of ` resonant abs tunneling ' , i.e. , the subgap transport of single electrons through the s - qd system , only allowed in multi - terminal devices .",
    "surprisingly , we find that depending on the imposed boundary conditions in the experiments it is possible to observe either abss or coulomb blockade resonances , or both in the same experiment , which we tentatively attribute to the competition between coherent oscillations in the abs ( exchange of cooper pairs with s ) and the relaxation of the system by single electron tunneling into the second normal terminal",
    ".    we believe that experiments on complex quantum systems using multiple terminals provide a novel and clear experimental probe for many old and new phenomena , here for example the onset of the superconducting proximity effect on a qd and the formation of many - body quantum states .",

    "<S> andreev bound states ( abss ) are well - defined many - body quantum states that emerge from the hybridization of individual quantum dot ( qd ) states with a superconductor and exhibit very rich and fundamental phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate several new electron transport phenomena mediated by abss that form on three - terminal carbon nanotube ( cnt ) qds , with one superconducting ( s ) contact in the center and two adjacent normal metal ( n ) contacts . </S>",
    "<S> three - terminal spectroscopy allows us to identify the coupling to the n contacts as the origin of the andreev resonance ( ar ) linewidths and to determine the critical coupling strengths to s , for which a ground state ( or quantum phase ) transition in such s - qd systems can occur . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we ascribe replicas of the lowest - energy abs resonance to transitions between the abs and odd - parity excited qd states , a process we call excited state abs resonances . in the conductance between the two n contacts we find a characteristic pattern of positive and negative differential subgap conductance , which we explain by considering two nonlocal processes , the creation of cooper pairs in s by electrons from both n terminals , and a novel transport mechanism called resonant abs tunneling , possible only in multi - terminal qd devices . in the latter process , electrons are transferred via the abs without effectively creating cooper pairs in s. the three - terminal geometry also allows spectroscopy experiments with different boundary conditions , for example by leaving s floating . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , we find that , depending on the boundary conditions and the device parameters , the experiments either show single - particle coulomb blockade resonances , abs characteristics , or both in the same measurements , seemingly contradicting the notion of abss replacing the single particle states as eigenstates of the qd . we qualitatively explain these results as originating from the finite time scale required for the coherent oscillations between the superposition states after a single electron tunneling event . </S>",
    "<S> these experiments demonstrate that three - terminal experiments on a single complex quantum object can also be useful to investigate charge dynamics otherwise not accessible due to the very high frequencies . </S>"
