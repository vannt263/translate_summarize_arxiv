    "as physics orients itself increasingly towards soft condensed matter and biology , the twin challenges of understanding how linear homopolymers collapse and how proteins fold into their ground states ( `` native states '' in the language of protein biochemistry ) are being attacked with ever increasing sophistication .",
    "chain - like polymers are often described by coarse - grained models that reduce the chemical composition to simple `` monomers '' or `` beads '' connected in linear fashion by strong chemical bonds @xcite .",
    "as the temperature is lowered , the non - bonded attraction between monomers cause the polymers to collapse into densely entwined structures @xcite .",
    "proteins are polymer chains with complex side groups , all composed of just a few kinds of atoms . in the same spirit , proteins are often represented by simplified linear polymers with * different * monomers in a particular sequence @xcite .",
    "protein folding is a complex process which is still poorly understood and which holds the key to unlocking a host of biological and medical secrets .",
    "both of these related types of systems have the complication that the geometric constraints and strong chemical bonds lead to entropic complexity in addition to energetic considerations .    in principle",
    "the entire apparatus of statistical mechanics can be brought to bear on the polymer collapse and protein folding problems , but the determination of the thermodynamic properties and ground states of each is still quite challenging .",
    "methods of computer simulation and improvements in computer performance have now reached a level of maturity , however , that they can begin to illuminate the polymer collapse or protein folding processes with good resolution .",
    "( of course , some of the clever techniques that have been developed for magnetic systems , e.g. cluster flipping , do not translate directly to use for the polymer / protein problem . ) hence , the focus of statistical physics is rapidly shifting to the study of biological systems using variations of some of the computational methods that have been well developed for liquids and solids .    in order to permit study of finite temperature behavior ,",
    "simple polymer / protein models treat the atoms in the chains as classical particles with strong chemical bonds and relatively weak interactions between atoms that are not connected by chemical bonds .",
    "nonetheless , even simple bead - spring models with empirical bonded and non - bonded potentials are still quite difficult to study at low temperature for long chains @xcite .",
    "hence , simple lattice models offer the best hope of capturing polymer collapse @xcite .",
    "proteins are even more difficult .",
    "although multiple microscopic , classical `` force fields '' , i.e. interaction hamiltonians , have been developed , proteins are sufficiently complex that these parametrized interaction fields are still of rather limited value . in an attempt to make the problem more tractable",
    ", dill  @xcite introduced a very simplified model which he believed contained the essential features of the protein folding problem without including all of the complexity . in dill s approach , proteins are modeled as lattice polymers which contain only two kinds of monomers : hydrophobic ( @xmath0 ) and polar ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the goal was to provide a model that was amenable to quantitative analysis and thus , it served as a basis for - and inspired - computational studies of various biophysical systems @xcite .",
    "however , it turns out that even dill s simplified protein model is very challenging for all but the shortest sequences . finding the ground states for an hp sequence",
    "is proven to be an np - hard problem @xcite .",
    "in contrast to molecular dynamics , which is generally restricted to time scales of a few tens or hundreds of nano - seconds , clever monte carlo algorithms , which do not follow a physical time scale , can be used to explore behavior at much longer time scales @xcite .",
    "( of course , for lattice models molecular dynamics does not work at all . )",
    "the `` workhorse '' monte carlo method in statistical physics , developed almost 60 years ago , has been the metropolis importance sampling algorithm @xcite ; but more recently new , efficient algorithms have begun to play a role in allowing simulation to achieve the resolution which is needed to accurately locate and characterize `` interesting '' thermodynamic behavior @xcite .",
    "traditional methods show quite long time correlations and require excessively long runs to obtain precise results .",
    "as we shall see , for certain lengths homopolymers may have complicated behavior as the temperature is lowered .",
    "these difficulties also hold true for protein models that , as expected , have complex free energy landscapes with energy barriers between states of low free energy @xcite .",
    "consequently , `` standard '' monte carlo methods become easily `` trapped '' in metastable states from which they have difficulty escaping .",
    "here we review a relatively new , general , efficient monte carlo algorithm ( known as  wang - landau sampling \" @xcite ) that offers substantial advantages over other approaches @xcite .",
    "we will then describe the application of this algorithm to the study of lattice polymers of different chain length and then to the hp model for several `` characteristic '' lattice protein sequences .",
    "one step further in complexity , we will also present our work on the problem of protein adsorption where we investigate hp model proteins interacting with an attractive surface .",
    "there have been a substantial number of other studies performed with different simulational methods , and we shall try to place our results in perspective .",
    "our lattice homopolymer model consists of a sequence of identical monomers on sites of a periodic lattice , and these monomers are connected together by unbreakable nearest neighbor bonds .",
    "the weak interactions between monomers which are chemically separated but physically nearby are modeled by an attractive nearest neighbor potential ; otherwise they do not interact .",
    "the hp model is a simple , prototypical lattice protein model consisting of only two types of monomers , hydrophobic ( h ) and polar ( p ) , in a sequence chosen so as to mimic a real protein  @xcite .",
    "the chemical bonds between monomers can not break , and * non - bonded * interactions are restricted to an attractive coupling , @xmath2 , between hydrophobic monomers that occupy nearest - neighbor sites . although the model is obviously over - simplified , it is intended to capture the hydrophobic character , which is considered as the `` driving force '' for protein folding @xcite .",
    "moreover , in spite of the simplicity of the model , for long chain lengths it is often very challenging to determine the lowest possible energy ( native state ) for the folded chain .    in the presence of an attractive surface , the homopolymer and protein models can be easily extended to include the interaction between the monomers and the surface .",
    "( here , we shall confine ourselves to the protein case . for an overview of lattice homopolymers interacting with surfaces ,",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite . ) in the simplest case for proteins the surface attracts both types of monomers with strength @xmath3 and is introduced to the 3-dimensional lattice as an @xmath4-plane placed at @xmath5 .",
    "a second , non - attractive wall is placed at @xmath6 to keep the hp chain from diffusing far away from the bottom surface , but @xmath7 is still sufficiently large that the protein can still be fully extended while in contact with the surface .",
    "periodic boundaries are used for the @xmath8 and @xmath9 directions .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model is then represented as @xcite : @xmath10 @xmath11 being the number of h - h interacting pairs and @xmath12 being the number of monomers adjacent to the bottom surface .",
    "the shortcomings of traditional monte carlo algorithms led to the development of a different , iterative approach to monte carlo sampling which executes a random walk in energy space rather than in probability space .",
    "this algorithm is now widely referred to as `` wang - landau sampling '' and has already been described in detail for interacting magnetic spin systems @xcite . the same basic approach applies to lattice polymers / proteins , but suitable trial moves must be implemented for the method to work efficiently @xcite . unlike the metropolis monte carlo method , wang - landau sampling does not depend upon the system temperature and focuses instead on the density of states @xmath13 .",
    "if we perform a random walk in energy space by moving monomers , and the probability to visit a given energy level @xmath14 is proportional to the reciprocal of @xmath15 , then a flat histogram of energies that have been visited is generated .",
    "this is done iteratively by modifying the estimated @xmath13 to produce a `` flat '' histogram of energies that have been visited ( over the allowed range of energy ) while making @xmath13 converge to the true value . during each succeeding step of the random",
    "walk , @xmath15 is modified and the updated value is used to continue the random walk in energy space .    initially , @xmath15 can be set to @xmath16 for all possible energies @xmath14 .",
    "then a random walk in energy space is begun . if @xmath17 and @xmath18 are energies before and after a monomer is moved , the transition probability from energy level @xmath17 to @xmath18 is @xmath19 each time an energy level @xmath14 is visited , we multiply the existing value of @xmath15 by a `` modification factor '' @xmath20 .",
    "( as a practical matter it is preferable to work with the logarithm , i.e. @xmath21 , so that all possible values of @xmath15 will fit into double precision numbers . )",
    "if a trial move is rejected , the system stays at the same energy and the existing density of states is multiplied by the modification factor . while multiple choices are possible , a reasonable value of the initial modification factor is @xmath22 during the random walk , we also accumulate a histogram @xmath23 , i.e. the number of visits at each energy level @xmath14 , in energy space .",
    "when the histogram is sufficiently  flat \" over the entire energy range of the random walk , @xmath15 converges to the true value with an accuracy proportional to that modification factor @xmath24 .",
    "we then reduce the modification factor using a function like @xmath25 , reset the histogram , and begin the next iteration of the random walk .",
    "this process continues until the histogram is  flat \" again and we then reduce the modification factor @xmath26 and restart .",
    "the process is halted when the modification factor is smaller than some predefined value .",
    "( we determined that @xmath27 was a good choice for the models considered here . ) note that the phrase `` flat histogram '' refers to a histogram @xmath23 for which all entries are not less than @xmath28 of the average histogram @xmath29 , where @xmath28 depends upon the desired accuracy of the density of states .    during the early iterations",
    "the algorithm does not satisfy the detailed balance condition , since @xmath15 is constantly modified ; however , after many iterations , @xmath15 converges to the true value as the modification factor approaches @xmath30 .",
    "if @xmath31 is the transition probability from the energy level @xmath17 to level @xmath18 , from equation ( [ eqn : p ] ) , the ratio of the transition probabilities from @xmath17 to @xmath18 and from @xmath18 to @xmath17 can be calculated very easily as @xmath32 where @xmath15 is the density of states .",
    "thus , the random walk algorithm satisfies detailed balance .",
    "the proof of convergence , i.e. finding of the correct @xmath15 , of the wang - landau algorithm has been given rather in view of an optimization procedure than by means of markov chain monte carlo arguments@xcite . in this respect",
    "the condition of detailed balance does not bear much importance ( note that thermodynamic quantities are obtained only indirectly from @xmath15 ) .",
    "nonetheless , for certain trial move sets , it is important to correct eq .",
    "( 2 ) for unequal move ratios in order to fulfill detailed balance and to avoid a possible bias in the final estimate of @xmath15@xcite .",
    "simple trial moves that allow single monomer , or only a few neighboring monomers , to move , ( e.g. end - bond flips , kink jumps or crankshaft moves , as shown in fig .",
    "[ mcmoves ] ) have been developed and used for many years for the study of geometric properties of lattice polymers .",
    "these simple moves by themselves do not produce an ergodic process , although the inclusion of `` pivot '' moves restores ergodicity @xcite .",
    "this does not solve all the problems , however , since the acceptance rate of `` pivot '' moves becomes extremely low for compact polymers .",
    "for this reason , additional trial moves need to be implemented , regardless of the monte carlo algorithm used .",
    "we have adopted two types of trial moves in our wang - landau sampling simulations and determined that their use proves to be extremely effective at accelerating convergence @xcite .",
    "the first kind of trial move , `` pull moves '' , effectively threads all of , or a portion of , the polymer along the existing , entangled polymer structure @xcite . a second kind of trial move , `` bond - rebridging '' , does not actually move any monomers but cuts bonds on opposite sides of an elementary plaquette and redraws them on the other two sides to change the polymer conformation dramatically in a single trial move @xcite .",
    "since the monomers do not move , bond - rebridging alone is not ergodic , but we shall combine pull moves with bond - rebridging and ergodicity is no longer a problem . fig .",
    "[ mcmoves ] shows examples of `` traditional '' trial moves as well as of the ones applied in our monte carlo simulations ( pull and bond - rebridging moves ) .",
    "examples of trial moves typically applied in monte carlo simulations of lattice polymers and proteins ( here shown for a 2d sc lattice only ) .",
    "( a ) end - bond flip , kink jump and crankshaft move ; ( b ) pivot move ; ( c ) pull move ; ( d ) bond - rebridging move . these types of trial moves can be adopted to systems of any dimension @xmath33 . ]",
    "since all monomers are equivalent , obtaining results for multiple values of the monomer number @xmath34 will enable us to attempt to determine the systematic behavior of the polymer collapse as the length diverges . however , the length dependence is not at all simple .",
    "those homopolymers of length @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is an integer , are special in that their ground state is a perfect cube of monomers .",
    "( note , because of the constraints due to the bond connectivity , the attainment of this cubic overall structure involves quite complicated configurations . )",
    "if the polymer is slightly longer or shorter than a `` magic number '' , the behavior may change dramatically because of the extra degrees of freedom for those monomers that lie outside a perfect cube . for now , we will concentrate on homopolymers whose length is a `` magic number '' so that we can compare behaviors as the length increases .",
    "the specific heat demonstrates the complexity of the behavior as the temperature is reduced .",
    "first , as shown in fig .  [ figure1 ] for @xmath37 a high temperature shoulder with a low temperature pronounced peak is found . for @xmath38 a rounded maximum appears to signal the polymer collapse into a globule . at much lower temperature",
    ", however , another , sharper peak announces the rearrangement of bonds to allow the polymer to assume a configuration that is very close to the ground state , i.e. there is kind of a `` freezing transition '' . with increasing chain length the upper peak grows in magnitude monotonically and shifts , systematically to higher temperature .",
    "in contrast , as the chain length increases , the lower temperature peak shifts downwards in temperature and decreases in magnitude .",
    "this shows clearly that in the present model ( simple cubic lattice homopolymer model ) no symmetry breaking is taking place between a dense liquid and a crystal state ( both have simple cubic symmetry ) .",
    "the origin and sharpness of the low temperature peak is rather the result of geometrical surface reconstructions which involve the simultaneous displacement of many monomers . to provide some insight into the homopolymer behavior , in the lower part of the figure we show `` snapshots '' of typical states of an @xmath39 homopolymer at different temperatures above and below the two peaks .",
    "in addition , there is interesting structure developing just above this sharp , low temperature peak . at first a small ,",
    "broadened peak appears , but it then flattens out and the specific heat then begins to show small oscillations which appear to be larger than the statistical error bars . according to `` snapshots '' of the homopolymer structure ,",
    "these small oscillations seem to result from shifts of compact portions of the ground state cube to create distorted surfaces",
    ". clearly , high resolution results for still longer chains would be highly desirable to illuminate the actual behavior at , and just above , the low temperature transition .",

    "unlike the simple , lattice homopolymers , the monomers of hp lattice proteins are not all equivalent . each protein has a specific sequence of @xmath0 s and @xmath1 s , and there is no way to extrapolate the behavior to that of an infinite length equivalent .",
    "a number of specific choices of length and sequence have served as `` benchmarks '' in the literature ; and , for pedagogical reasons , we shall emphasize only a few three dimensional systems in the current treatment .",
    "the sequence 3d103 ( pphhppppphhpphhphpphppppppphppphhphhpppppphpphphpphppppphhhpppphhphhppppphhpppphhhhphpppppppphhhhhpphpp ) is a benchmark sequence whose native state has proven to be particularly difficult to determine , so we will now concentrate our discussion on this system .",

    "the native state is degenerate , and in some cases there are multiple sequences of the same length that give different results for both native state energies and temperature dependent behavior .",
