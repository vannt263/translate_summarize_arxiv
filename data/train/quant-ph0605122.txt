    "<S> we report significant improvements in the retrieval efficiency of a single excitation stored in an atomic ensemble and in the subsequent generation of strongly correlated pairs of photons . a 50@xmath0 probability of transforming the stored excitation into one photon in a well - defined spatio - temporal mode at the output of the ensemble is demonstrated . </S>",
    "<S> these improvements are illustrated by the generation of high - quality heralded single photons with a suppression of the two - photon component below 1@xmath0 of the value for a coherent state . </S>",
    "<S> a broad characterization of our system is performed for different parameters in order to provide input for the future design of realistic quantum networks .    </S>",
    "<S> a basic requirement for long distance quantum communication is the ability to efficiently interface atoms and light . </S>",
    "<S> deterministic or heralded storage of light in atomic systems is essential for guaranteeing the scalability of protocols to distribute quantum entanglement over large distances , such as in the quantum repeater scheme @xcite . in 2001 , a significant step towards the realization of a quantum repeater was the proposal by duan , lukin , cirac , and zoller ( dlcz ) of an alternative design involving atomic ensembles , linear optics , and single photon detectors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the building block of this roadmap is a large ensemble of identical atoms with a @xmath1-type level configuration as sketched in figure [ setup ] . </S>",
    "<S> a weak write pulse induces spontaneous raman scattering of a photon in field 1 , transferring an atom in the ensemble to the initially empty @xmath2 ground state . for a low enough write power , such that two excitations to the @xmath2 ground state are unlikely to occur </S>",
    "<S> , the detection of the field-1 photon heralds the storage of a single spin excitation distributed among the whole ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> a classical read pulse can later , after a user - defined delay , transfer this atomic excitation into another photonic mode ( field 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these scattering events are collectively enhanced thanks to a many - atom interference effect and can result in a high signal - to - noise ratio @xcite . by following this line , nonclassical correlations @xcite and entanglement @xcite have been observed between pairs of photons emitted by a single atomic ensemble . by combining the output of two different ensembles , as originally suggested in the dlcz protocol , </S>",
    "<S> heralded entanglement between two remote ensembles has been recently demonstrated @xcite , paving the way for more complex implementations of dlcz schemes . _ a posteriori _ ( probabilistic ) </S>",
    "<S> polarization entanglement between two distant ensembles has also been demonstrated recently @xcite , which does not lead to scalable capabilities for quantum networks .    </S>",
    "<S> experimental setup . </S>",
    "<S> pbs stands for polarizing beam splitter , h and v respectively for horizontal and vertical polarization . </S>",
    "<S> the filter stage for field 1 corresponds to a paraffin - coated vapor cell ( see text for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> the inset illustrates the relevant atomic level scheme.,width=415 ]    however , up to now , experiments have been plagued by low retrieval efficiency of the stored excitation and background noise . </S>",
    "<S> the low efficiency limits the extension to more complicated memory - based protocols , as their success relies on many - fold coincidences . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , background noise prevents prior experiments from reaching the very low excitation regime , in which high photon - pair correlation and more pure conditional states can be obtained . </S>",
    "<S> we report here significant experimental progress to overcome these two limitations , which is crucial to enable realistic quantum networks . as an illustration , high - quality heralded photons </S>",
    "<S> are generated . </S>",
    "<S> these conditional single photons are spectrally narrow and emitted in a well - defined spatio - temporal mode </S>",
    "<S> . they are thus well - suited for diverse interactions between light and matter @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the experimental setup is shown in figure [ setup ] . </S>",
    "<S> the optically thick atomic ensemble is obtained from cold cesium atoms in a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) </S>",
    "<S> . the cs hyperfine levels @xmath3 correspond to levels @xmath4 begins . for each trial , </S>",
    "<S> the atoms are initially prepared in level @xmath5 by illuminating the cloud with trapping and repumping light for 0.5 and 1.1 @xmath6 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> a weak write pulse , with a 200 @xmath7 beam waist , and detuned 10 mhz below the @xmath5 to @xmath8 transition , is first sent into the atomic sample . for a low enough excitation probability , </S>",
    "<S> the detection of a field-1 photon heralds the transfer of an atom from the @xmath5 to the @xmath2 ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the read pulse , which is on resonance with the @xmath2 to @xmath8 transition , orthogonally polarized with respect to the write beam and mode - matched to it , is then fired after a programmable delay . both write and read pulses have about 30 ns duration . </S>",
    "<S> fields 1 and 2 are directed into fibers with a @xmath9 angle relative to the common direction defined by write and read beams @xcite , and with a waist of 50 @xmath7 for the projected mode in the atomic sample . </S>",
    "<S> this angle allows an efficient spatial filtering . </S>",
    "<S> field 1 ( 2 ) is detected , with a polarization orthogonal to the write ( read ) beam , by single - photon silicon avalanche photodiodes ( apd ) , and the electronic signals are sent to a data acquisition card , in order to record the detection events and analyze the correlations . at the end of the 5 ms sequence , </S>",
    "<S> a new mot is formed . </S>",
    "<S> note that , before detection , field 1 passes through a filtering stage , in which it goes out of the fiber , through a paraffin - coated cs vapor cell , and back into the fiber @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the vapor cell is initially prepared with all atoms in @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> it filters out the photons in field 1 that are spontaneously emitted when the atoms in the sample go back to @xmath5 , which do not trigger the creation of the desired collective state .    </S>",
    "<S> characterization of the system as a function of the probability @xmath10 to detect a photon from field 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the frames give respectively the normalized intensity cross - correlation function @xmath11 between fields 1 and 2 , the conditional retrieval efficiency @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , which is the probability to detect a pair of photons , one in each field . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath14 is obtained from the measured conditional probability @xmath15 to detect field 2 once an event in field 1 has been recorded by the relation @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the two points with lowest @xmath10 were obtained without trapping light ( just repumper ) between trials , in order to reduce the noise level . </S>",
    "<S> all error bars are smaller than the symbol size . </S>",
    "<S> the solid lines are from the simplified model of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , with one set of parameters for all plots . </S>",
    "<S> the triangle indicates the experimental conditions for the entanglement measurement reported in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite.,width=453 ]    an important figure of merit in studying the correlations in a photon - pair experiment is the normalized intensity cross - correlation function @xmath17 , where @xmath13 is the probability to detect a pair of photons , and @xmath18 are the probabilities of detecting a single photon in field @xmath19 . in our case , measuring a value of @xmath11 larger than 2 is a strong indication of non - classical correlations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another measure for the quality of the pair generation process is the degree of suppression @xmath20 of the two - photon component of the field obtained from the retrieval of the collective excitation ( field 2 conditioned on a detection in field 1 ) , when compared to a coherent state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another critical parameter to characterize the efficiency of the setup , as underlined before , is the ability to efficiently retrieve the stored excitation by firing a read pulse . </S>",
    "<S> we will denote @xmath14 the probability to have a photon in field 2 , in a single spatial mode , at the output of the atomic ensemble once an event has been recorded for field 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the conditional probability @xmath15 of having a detection event in field 2 is , of course , lower due to experimental losses from the atomic ensemble to the detector . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath21 is the overall detection efficiency for field 2 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are directly related by @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> for our setup , @xmath22 due to 50@xmath0 transmission loss in the field 2 pathway and the 50@xmath0 detection efficiency of the apds . </S>",
    "<S> the overall detection efficiency for field 1 is also around 0.25 .    </S>",
    "<S> note that , for a given degree of correlation characterized by @xmath11 and @xmath20 , the actual operation of a quantum information protocol , like the quantum repeater scheme proposed by dlcz , can be evaluated based on the values for @xmath10 , @xmath15 , and the memory time of each site . a detailed analysis of the perspectives for memory time in our system has been addressed in a previous paper @xcite . in the present work , </S>",
    "<S> we are more concerned with the other quantities , so that we fix our read / write delay at 300 ns .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ characterization ] gives the experimental data for @xmath11 , the conditional retrieval efficiency @xmath14 , and the joint probability @xmath13 , as functions of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the rate of coincidence counts per second can be obtained by multiplying @xmath13 by the number of trials per second ( 44000 in our case ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that all measurements reported in this paper are not corrected for any background or dark noise . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental points are fitted according to the model introduced in @xcite , which assumes that the total fields at the output of the mot consist of a two - mode squeezed state plus background fields in coherent states ( which change in proportion to the write field , such as light scattered from the write laser or background fluorescence from uncorrelated atoms that are also excited by the write beam ) and two incoherent backgrounds to account for processes that do not depend on the write beam intensity ( residual light from the environment or the mot , and dark noise of the detectors ) . these results for @xmath11 show more than a ten - fold improvement on previous reported experiments @xcite . for the highest value @xmath23 </S>",
    "<S> , the write pulse contains about @xmath24 photons .    </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the @xmath14 curve reveals different regimes for photon - pair generation . </S>",
    "<S> for high @xmath10 , @xmath14 decreases as @xmath10 is reduced , since the multi - excitation processes decrease with the energy of the write pulse . </S>",
    "<S> once we reach the single excitation regime , @xmath14 follows a plateau , since each detected field-1 photon ( with whatever small rate ) can lead to the subsequent detection of only one field-2 photon . in this regime , </S>",
    "<S> the probabilities for multi - excitation are negligible . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath10 approaches the noise floor , however , @xmath14 starts to decrease again due to false field-1 detection induced by the noise . from the plateau on the @xmath14 curve </S>",
    "<S> , it results that the retrieval efficiency of a single excitation in our system is approximately 50 @xmath0 ( corresponding to a measured @xmath25 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this value represents a three to five - fold improvement with respect to previous works @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we note that ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite has also investigated single - photon generation via the collective emission of an atomic ensemble , here coupled to an optical cavity . </S>",
    "<S> however , no direct measure of the single - photon character of the retrieved field 2 was given . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , a retrieval efficiency was determined by way of the ratio @xmath26/@xmath10 , which has , contrary to @xmath15 , the drawback of being dependent on the characterization and modelling of the uncorrelated background fields . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , applying the same criteria to our measurements leads to a  retrieval efficiency \" of around 160@xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> suppression of the two - photon component of field 2 conditioned on the detection events in field 1 , measured by the @xmath20 parameter , as a function of @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest value obtained is @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> all points in this plot were obtained without trapping light between trials . </S>",
    "<S> the full curve is from a fit based on the simplified model of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , with the same parameters as in figure 2.,width=415 ]    as emphasized previously , the photon - pair correlations enable the generation of heralded single photons . this method has been widely and very successfully used over the past decades , firstly with twin photons generated by an atomic cascade @xcite , then by using the more efficient technique of parametric down conversion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more recently atomic ensembles were introduced as an alternative source of single photons @xcite . to assess the quality of the single photon generated , </S>",
    "<S> a 50/50 fiber beam splitter ( with 20% transmission loss ) is inserted into the pathway of field 2 , and two detectors , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , are used to record the events . figure [ g2 ] gives the parameter @xmath20 for the detection of two photons from field 2 , conditioned upon the detection of an initial photon in field 1 . </S>",
    "<S> this parameter measures the single - photon character of field 2 . </S>",
    "<S> for both experiment and theory , this quantity was obtained from single and joint probabilities by the expression @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 indicates the probability for a triple coincidence between the three detectors , and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) gives the probability for coincidences between detectors @xmath34 and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) . </S>",
    "<S> a best value of @xmath35 is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> this represents more than a twenty - fold improvement on the first reported value @xcite , and ten - fold on the subsequent extensions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , this value is close to the best reported ones in parametric down conversion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this low value makes this source relevant in the realization of linear - optics quantum computation @xcite , where two - photon contamination must be minimized . </S>",
    "<S> note again that these photons are narrowband and thus well - suited for light - atom interfacing @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> these large improvements were obtained after an empirical adjustment of the duration and energy ( @xmath36 photons per pulse ) of the read pulse , and an increased optical depth ( @xmath37 ) of the ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> we also incorporated several improvements previously implemented by other groups , like the off - axis detection geometry ( introduced by s. harris s group @xcite and later optimized by a. kuzmich s group @xcite ) and the use of large - waist write and read beams @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also found that it is essential to continue using the frequency filter in field 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of this filter in recent experiments that rely completely on postselection @xcite might be responsible for an effective decrease of @xmath15 and the measured correlations .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have reported the efficient generation of photon - pairs from atomic ensembles , following the building block of the dlcz roadmap . </S>",
    "<S> apart from unprecedented nonclassical correlations in this configuration , we obtained high retrieval efficiency of the stored excitation around 50@xmath0 , which is a critical parameter for the realization of sophisticated quantum networks and memory - based protocols . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of having high @xmath15 and @xmath14 is clearly illustrated in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , in which the small values of these quantities limits the ability to infer the degree of entanglement between the two distant ensembles . </S>"
