    "superfluid behavior is the most striking property of liquid @xmath0he .",
    "we recall that spectacular experiments of kapitza as well as allen and misener in 1938 first showed that liquid @xmath0he below the transition temperature of 2.19k could exhibit flow through thin channels without any viscosity .",
    "since then , a dominant theme of research on liquid @xmath0he has been to understand the origin of this superfluidity and to work out how it modifies the dynamical response functions and excitations of liquid @xmath0he .    by the early 1960 s , a successful field theoretic formalism was developed@xcite , with the broken - symmetry expectation value of the quantum field operator @xmath1 playing the role of the order parameter of the bose superfluid . in this theory ,",
    "bose - condensation was the underlying source of _ all _ the unique properties of superfluid @xmath0he ( equivalence of density fluctuations with elementary excitations , two - fluid hydrodynamical behavior at low frequencies , superfluid flow , quantized vortices , etc ) . in striking contrast to the atomic bose gases , the explicit role of the bose condensate",
    "is somewhat hidden in superfluid @xmath0he .",
    "indeed , this fact has encouraged the development of theories for superfluid @xmath0he based on variational groundstate wavefunctions ( beginning with feynman in the mid-1950 s ) without any explicit reference to the underlying role of the macroscopic wavefunction describing the condensate . while very useful for computational purposes , these approaches have given little insight into the fact that there is a new phase in liquid @xmath0he which exhibits superfluidity .",
    "for this reason , they do not appear to give much hope for developing a general theory of the superfluid dynamics of bose fluids , going from dilute gases to liquid @xmath0he .",
    "such a unified description of this kind has taken on a new importance as a result of spectacular advances that have occured in bec research in the last year .",
    "these discoveries have started to focus research interest in atomic gases on issues related to superfluidity .",
    "the recent creation of quantized vortices ( at jila in boulder@xcite and the ens in paris@xcite ) have suddenly made the bec community aware of rotating traps , mutual friction , vortex arrays , etc , ideas long familiar to the superfluid @xmath0he community .",
    "in addition , the successful creation of a bec in @xmath2rb gas at jila@xcite by working close to a feshbach resonance has given us a superfluid bose gas where the s - wave scattering length @xmath3 can be enormous @xmath4 .",
    "already this has moved the value of the gas parameter @xmath5 from the range @xmath6 ( typical for recent bec experiments@xcite using @xmath7rb and @xmath8na atoms ) to a respectable @xmath9 .",
    "thus atomic condensates are `` starting '' to overlap on a strongly interacting bose liquid like @xmath0he ( where @xmath10 , with @xmath3 now being the hard core diameter ) .",
    "more generally , the bec community is increasingly using the language and ideas developed in condensed matter and quantum liquid research .",
    "arguments based on topological arguments are used ( untwisting of order parameters@xcite , for example ) .",
    "recent bragg experiments using second - order raman scattering of light have allowed one to measure@xcite the dynamic structure factor @xmath11 of trapped bose gases , a quantity which has played a central role in our understanding of superfluid @xmath0he for almost 50 years.@xcite in the last few years , much of the theoretical analysis of atomic condensates has come from condensed matter theorists who have worked on superfluid liquids ( such as baym , fetter , ho , leggett , pethick , pitaevskii and stringari ) .",
    "we hope that the superfluid @xmath0he experimental community will be stimulated by the new bec child in their midst and , in particular , come up with new ideas about how to probe the bose - condensed nature of superfluid @xmath0he .    as a contribution to this emerging synthesis",
    ", this article reviews recent work@xcite on deriving ( from an approximate but still microscopic model ) the two - fluid hydrodynamic equations for a trapped bose gas at finite temperatures .",
    "the equivalent two - fluid equations were first derived phenomenologically by landau in 1941 , initially without any reference to a bose condensate .",
    "generalized to include damping from transport coefficients , these coupled equations for the superfluid and normal fluid components form the basis of our understanding of all `` superfluid '' behavior in liquid @xmath0he.@xcite this two - fluid description was later proven to be a consequence of a bose broken - symmetry by bogoliubov@xcite in 1963 , with the superfluid velocity @xmath12 always being proportional to the gradient of the phase of @xmath13 .",
    "of course , the two - fluid hydrodynamic equations describe local equilibrium and require that there be enough collisions to achieve this @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the relaxation time needed to reach local equilibrium ) .",
    "this is easy to achieve in a liquid ( including liquid @xmath0he ) and that is why , historically , classical fluid hydrodynamics was understood a long time before a microscopic treatment was available . using a kinetic equation for interacting atoms , it was boltzmann who first ( @xmath16 1885 ) discussed the precise set of conditions required for this hydrodynamic description to be valid .",
    "up to the present , most experiments on the collective modes of bose gases have probed the opposite `` collisionless region '' @xmath17 however one expects that the two - fluid hydrodynamic region will be increasingly studied in the next few years , taking advantage of the fact that one can now produce high densities of atoms ( currently , @xmath18 atoms ) and also we can enormously increase the atomic collision cross - section @xmath19 by working near a feshbach resonance ( as in recent work@xcite on @xmath2rb ) .    as references on bec research",
    ", we recommend the 1998 varenna summer school lectures@xcite as well as the excellent review@xcite by the trento theory group . for a detailed treatment of topics discussed here ,",
    "see refs .. 1.5 true cm",
    "the crucial idea behind the field - theoretic description of bose condensation developed 40 years ago@xcite is to isolate the condensate `` degree of freedom . ''",
    "thus the quantum field operator is decomposed as @xmath20 where @xmath21 describes the bose condensate ( which is treated as a classical field ) . here",
    "@xmath22 is the non - condensate component of the quantum field operator and satisfies bose commutation relations .",
    "this formalism ( first developed in a systematic way by beliaev in 1958 ) allows one to neatly isolate the condensate .",
    "the many - body theory is then developed to study the dynamics of the non - condensate fields @xmath23 and @xmath24 , with the condensate playing the role of the `` vacuum . ''",
    "a crucial feature is that @xmath13 is complex ,    @xmath25    with the identification ( this is justified later ) of the superfluid velocity @xmath26 @xmath27 at @xmath28 in a dilute bose gas , one can assume that all the atoms are in the condensate @xmath29 which satisfies the famous gross - pitaevskii time - dependent equation of motion@xcite , @xmath30\\phi({\\br } , t ) .",
    "\\label{dynamics - eq3}\\ ] ] here @xmath31 is the parabolic trap potential ( a magnetic trap acting on the spin of an hyperfine atomic level ) and @xmath32 is the hartree field produced by the condensate atoms . at the very low temperatures of interest in bec studies , the atoms have very low energy and one can use the @xmath33-wave scattering length approximation . in this case , the effective interatomic interaction is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 one should not think of ( [ dynamics - eq3 ] ) as simply a schrodinger equation for a `` single - particle '' wavefunction , since @xmath36 is an order - parameter which is well defined even at finite temperatures ( see later ) .",
    "as we all have learned over the last 5 years , the @xmath28 gp equation in ( [ dynamics - eq3 ] ) contains a huge amount of physics and its solutions have dominated bec research up to now.@xcite many examples are discussed in the invited and contributed papers at this qfs conference .    the stationary solutions that the gp equation @xmath37 satisfy _ 0()=_0_0().[dynamics - eq4 ]    this can exhibit ground state solutions corresponding to vortices , in which there is a time - independent condensate current given by @xmath38 in the absence of vortices ( irrotational flow ) , the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximate solution of ( [ dynamics - eq4 ] ) is very simple and leads to the famous parabolic condensate profile n_c0 ( ) |_0()|^2 = 1g.[dynamics - eq5]this profile is considerably wider than the ground state gaussian wavefunction prediction for a non - interacting trapped gas .",
    "it is very convenient to rewrite the gp equation ( [ dynamics - eq3 ] ) in terms of the condensate density @xmath39 and velocity @xmath40 local variables .",
    "one finds & = & - n_c ( , t)_s ( , t ) + m(_st + 1 2_s^2 ) & = & -_c ( , t ) , [ dynamics - eq6 ] where the condensate chemical potential is _ c ( , t ) -^2 ^ 2 2m+v_ex ( ) + gn_c ( , t ) .",
    "[ dynamics - eq7 ] written in this form , the condensate dynamics is `` hydrodynamic '' looking , even in the absence of collisions .",
    "this is because the gp equation ( [ dynamics - eq3 ] ) describes a large number of atoms in the _ same _ single - particle quantum state .",
    "linearizing around @xmath41 , the two coupled equations in ( [ dynamics - eq6 ] ) can be solved for the collective oscillations of the condensate at @xmath28 .",
    "a standard simplification ( first introduced by stringari@xcite ) is to neglect the `` quantum pressure '' , the first term in ( [ dynamics - eq7 ] ) . within this tf approximation ,",
    "one obtains the stringari `` wave equation '' for fluctuations in @xmath42 = - ( n_c0_s t ) = g m(n_c0 ( ) n_c).[dynamics - eq8]we note that this wave equation could be equally well written in terms of fluctuations of the phase of @xmath13 , since @xmath43 . as an example of such condensate oscillations",
    ", we consider a uniform bose gas , where @xmath44 this gives the famous bogoliubov phonon excitations of the condensate ( first derived in 1947 by a different method ) = c_0k ,  c_0=.[dynamics - eq9 ] these phonons are physically unrelated to ordinary ( hydrodynamic ) sound waves in a normal fluid .",
    "solutions of ( [ dynamics - eq8 ] ) corresponding to breathing , dipole , quadrupole and surface oscillations of an axially symmetric trap are in excellent agreement with experiment ( when @xmath45 atoms).@xcite",
    "it is straightforward to extend the preceding @xmath28 analysis to finite temperatures where there is a large fraction of atoms outside of the condensate described by @xmath46 one then needs _ two _ equations of motion@xcite : ( a ) a generalized gp equation for @xmath13 which includes coupling to the non - condensate atoms .",

    "one has to solve these coupled equations for @xmath13 and @xmath64 self - consistently - and clearly @xmath55 will play a special role .",
    "while ( [ dynamics - eq4 ] ) and ( [ superfluid - eq15 ] ) give a sound basis for discussing the general non - equilibrium behavior of trapped gases at finite @xmath62 , the collision - dominated hydrodynamic region is especially interesting since then the non - condensate can be described in terms of a few `` coarse - grained '' local variables .",
    "if the @xmath56 collisions are rapid enough ( relative to the frequency @xmath65 of the collective mode of interest , @xmath66 , then @xmath47 will be driven to the _ local _ equilibrium bose distribution @xmath67}-1}.   \\label{superfluid - eq19}\\ ] ] this function uniquely satisfies @xmath68=0.$ ] with this local equilibrium distribution , the thermal atoms are now completely described in terms of the @xmath69 and @xmath70 variables , all dependent on @xmath71 . inserting @xmath72 given by ( [ superfluid - eq19 ] ) into the boltzmann equation ( [ dynamics - eq4 ] ) and taking moments with respect to the momentum @xmath73 , one easily derives a set of hydrodynamic equations for the non - condensate variables @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "this procedure was first developed by boltzmann for deriving the hydrodynamic equations for a classical gas .    to summarize , at this stage we have arrived at a closed set of coupled equations@xcite for the condensate variables @xmath76 and the non - condensate variables @xmath77 .",
    "linearizing these equations around static equilibrium , one can derive the hydrodynamic collective modes which correspond to coherent motions of both the condensate and non - condensate .",
    "our new two - fluid equations exhibit a new relaxation time @xmath78 which describes how fast the two components come into diffusive equilibrium with each other ( i.e. , how fast @xmath79 relaxes to zero ) .",
    "of course , in static equilibrium , we have @xmath80 but when we perturb the trapped bose gas from equilibrium , one can have @xmath81 and it relaxes to zero in a time @xmath82 as one would expect , @xmath83 is proportional to the collision time @xmath84 associated with @xmath55 collisions .    how is all this related to landau s famous two - fluid hydrodynamic equations ?",
    "these equations are expressed using different local variables .",

    "s0_s + _ n0_n.[superfluid - eq21]make the two - fluid nature of the theory clear .",
    "we have included hydrodynamic damping from various transport processes ( the thermal conductivity @xmath88 , the shear viscosity @xmath89 and the four second viscosity coefficients @xmath90 , all dependent on position through the local condensate density @xmath91 ) . in making the detailed comparison between the landau two - fluid equations and our two - fluid equations , a key role",
    "is played by the condensate relaxation time @xmath83 introduced above .    in the limit",
    "@xmath92 one can show@xcite that our two - fluid equations are precisely equivalent to the landau equations summarized in ( [ superfluid - eq20 ] ) , but without the dissipative terms .",
    "this makes sense , since these equations are derived@xcite under the assumption that the superfluid and normal fluid are always in local equilibrium with each other .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath93 ie , @xmath94 however , even in this limit , it turns out that @xmath63 in ( [ superfluid - eq17 ] ) is finite and is crucial to ensure the equivalence with the landau equations .",
    "one finds one can make the identification ( valid within our model ) _ s ( , t ) & = & mn_c ( , t ) + _ n ( , t ) & = & mn ( , t).[superfluid - eq22 ]    in the limit of @xmath95 , our equations can be shown@xcite to reduce precisely to the landau - khalatnikov two - fluid equations@xcite in ( [ superfluid - eq20 ] ) .",
    "what is very satisfactory is that , in our model , the second viscosity damping terms turn out to be proportional to @xmath96 , i.e. , to the fact that @xmath97 this is physically quite reasonable and expected .",
    "thus the four second viscosities are all proportional to the collision time @xmath84 associated with the @xmath55 collision term . in contrast , the other transport coefficients @xmath98 and @xmath89 ) are associated with deviations for @xmath47 from the local equilibrium distribution ( [ superfluid - eq19 ] ) and have contributions from _ both _ the @xmath56 and @xmath55 collision integrals .",
    "finally , one can consider the new limit @xmath99 which can arise@xcite at temperatures close to @xmath100 ( where @xmath83 becomes very large due to a sort of `` critical slowing down '' ) .",
    "this is outside the region of validity of the usual landau two - fluid equations .",
    "surprisingly , however , our new linearized two - fluid equations lead again@xcite to the landau - khalatnikov two - fluid equations@xcite but now with frequency - dependent second viscosities    _ i ( ) = _ i 1-i_.[superfluid - eq23]this form could have been predicted , since it is typical of a situation where a fluid is coupled into an `` internal '' degree of freedom with a long relaxation time - in the present case , this is the bose condensate .    as one might expect , our new form of the two - fluid equation leads naturally to a central zero - frequency relaxational mode which is missed by the usual lk two - fluid hydrodynamic equations .",
    "one can show@xcite that as @xmath101 from below , this mode ( which is strongly coupled to the thermal conductivity ) becomes the usual zero frequency thermal diffusion mode .",
    "observation of this mode below @xmath100 is a goal for future bec studies since this mode is a unique feature of the hydrodynamics of a trapped bose gas .    in conclusion , we have sketched recent progress in deriving the equivalent of the dissipative landau - khalatnikov two - fluid hydrodynamic equations for a trapped bose - condensed gas . the nice feature about our derivation",
    "is that our microscopic model allows us to compute all the thermodynamic functions , transport coefficents and relaxation times which enter into these equations .",
    "what is needed now is a sustained experimental effort to check the predictions of this two - fluid theory .",
