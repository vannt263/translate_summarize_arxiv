    "the control of the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) by turbulence is a central issue in our present understanding of star formation , and currently a topic of intense study ( see , e.g. , the reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in recent years , several groups have studied the sfe of molecular clouds ( mcs ) using numerical simulations of isothermal turbulence , in which the entire numerical box represents the interior of a molecular cloud ( see , e.g. , the reviews by * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "one confusing issue is that simulations of _ driven _ turbulence seem to indicate that the sfe _ decreases _ as the turbulent rms mach number @xmath14 increases ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while simulations of _ decaying _ turbulence suggest that the sfe _ increases _ with increasing @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "this has prompted the question of how does turbulence actually originate and behave in real mcs . to answer this question ,",
    "it has become necessary to investigate the entire evolutionary process of mcs .",
    "the formation of mcs by collisions of warm neutral medium ( wnm ) streams has been intensely studied in recent years .",
    "a vast body of numerical simulations has shown that moderate , transonic compressions in the wnm can nonlinearly trigger a phase transition to the cold neutral medium ( cnm ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , and that the dense gas produced by this mechanism is overpressured with respect to the mean wnm thermal pressure @xcite and turbulent , due to the combined action of kelvin - helmholz , thermal @xcite and nonlinear thin - shell @xcite instabilities @xcite . the turbulence produced by this mechanism",
    "is continually driven for as long as the compression lasts .",
    "the physical scenario of mc evolution was outlined by @xcite , who estimated the column densities necessary for the cloud to become self - gravitating , molecular , and magnetically supercritical , finding them to be comparable .",
    "the one - dimensional physical conditions in the dense gas were calculated analytically by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a recent review of the subject has been presented by @xcite .",
    "more recently , simulations including self - gravity and `` sink particles '' , which represent gravitationally collapsed objects ( stars or stellar clusters ) , and using finite - duration compressions in the wnm , although lacking stellar feedback and magnetic fields , have been used to study the evolution of the turbulent motions and of the sfe in a self - consistent manner ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) . concerning the velocity dispersion in the clouds",
    ", these authors found that the turbulence is intermediate between driven and decaying , since what decays is the driving rate of the turbulence as the inflows weaken with time .",
    "however , they also found that the random motions are gradually replaced by global infall motions , as the cloud begins to contract gravitationally . concerning the sfe , paper i measured the masses of dense gas @xmath15 and of the collapsed stellar objects @xmath16 in the simulations , allowing a measurement of the sfe , defined as @xmath17 the resulting sfe was however too high , reaching @xmath18% roughly 6 myr after the time at which star formation ( sf ) had begun ( denoted @xmath19 ) , although this excessive sfe can possibly be attributed to the neglect of stellar feedback in that simulation . indeed , paper i estimated , using a prescription by @xcite and a standard imf @xcite , that by 3 myr after @xmath19 , enough massive stars would have formed as to be able to destroy the cloud by ionization . at that point ,",
    "the sfe was @xmath20% , closer to the typical values @xmath21% reported observationally for full mc complexes @xcite .",
    "one obvious possible reason for the relatively high values of the sfe obtained in this type of simulations is the neglect of stellar feedback and magnetic fields .",
    "however , it is also of interest to perform a more systematic investigation of the degree of variability that the sfe could exhibit within the scenario of paper i , simply by varying the parameters of the wnm compressions triggering the formation of the cloud complex . in this paper",
    "we undertake a first approach to such task , by varying three parameters of the wnm stream collisions modeled in the simulations .",
    "first , we consider the inflow speed @xmath22 and the velocity dispersion of the background turbulence initially present in the medium , both measured by their respective mach numbers , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , with respect to the unperturbed wnm .",
    "subsequently , we consider the mass in the colliding streams @xmath2 , as determined by their radius @xmath23 and length @xmath24 .",
    "since the parameter space covered by these three parameters is already quite large , in this work we do not consider variations in the collision angle of the streams , instead having them collide head - on in all cases .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : the_model ] we describe the numerical model and experiments . in  [ sec : results ] we present our results , and in  [ sec : conclusions ] we present a summary and our conclusions .",
    "for the numerical simulations , we use the same numerical setup as that used in paper i , except that we now use the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) + @xmath25-body code gadget-2 @xcite ( in paper i we used the previous version of the code , gadget ) , modified to include random turbulence driving and sink particles according to the prescription of @xcite , and including parameterized heating and cooling , as applied in paper i , using the fit of @xcite to a variety of atomic and molecular cooling processes .",
    "this cooling function causes the gas to be thermally unstable , under the isobaric mode , in the density range @xmath26 .",
    "we assume that the gas is all atomic , with a mean atomic weight of 1.27 .",
    "the numerical box is periodic , with size @xmath27 . in all cases ,",
    "we use @xmath28 particles , and set the mean number of particles within a smoothing volume to 40 . according to the criterion of @xcite , the mass resolution is twice the number of particles within a smoothing volume , or @xmath29 times the mass per particle .",
    "the critical density for sink formation is set at @xmath30 , and the outer sink accretion radius is set at 0.04 pc .",
    "an initial turbulent velocity field of one - dimensional velocity dispersion , characterized by its rms mach number @xmath1 and applied at scales between 1/4 and 1/8 of the box size , is added to the inflow velocity field , in order to trigger the instabilities that render the cloud turbulent .",
    "note that this added turbulent velocity field is applied by turning on the random driver for the first few timesteps of the simulation s evolution , and that what we actually control is the energy injection rate parameter .",
    "thus , simulations intended to have the same turbulence strength do so only approximately , as the flow s response is slightly different in every realization .",
    "the initial conditions consist of a uniform medium at @xmath31 and @xmath32 k , in which two cylinders of length @xmath24 along the @xmath33 direction and radius @xmath23 are set to collide head - on at the @xmath34 plane of the simulation ( refer to fig .  1 of paper i ) .",
    "note that the cylindrical inflows are entirely contained within the numerical box , since the boundaries are periodic .",
    "the length @xmath24 is measured from the central collision plane , and is always shorter than the half - length of the box , implying that a small region between the edge of the inflows and the box boundaries is not given any velocity .",
    "this region is partially evacuated during the subsequent evolution of the simulations , as the gas within it tends to fill the void left by the inflows .",
    "table [ tab : run_params ] shows the various runs we performed for the present study , indicating the relevant parameters for each one .",
    "in addition to the inflow length , radius , and velocity , defined above , table [ tab : run_params ] gives the mach number @xmath0 corresponding to @xmath22 at the initial temperature of the gas , for which the adiabatic sound speed is @xmath35 , the one - dimensional rms mach number of the initial turbulent motions , @xmath1 , the total mass contained in the simulation box , @xmath36 , the mass contained in the two inflows , @xmath2 , and the mass per sph particle , @xmath37 .",
    "the runs are labeled mnemonically , with their names giving , in that orded , the inflow mach number @xmath0 , the background mach number @xmath1 , and the inflow mass , @xmath2 .",
    "note that run mi1-mb.02-ma2e4 has the same parameters as run l256@xmath380.17 from paper i , and we take these as the `` fiducial '' set of parameters .",
    "note , however , that these two runs are not identical because they were performed with different codes .",
    "gadget-2 differs in many ways from gadget , and in particular it takes longer timesteps , implying that the initial forcing ( used to trigger the instabilities in the dense layer ) is applied at different time intervals , and with different random seeds .",
    "thus , the two runs are similar only in a statistical sense , but are not identical . for reference , in fig .",
    "[ fig : run4_img ] we show a face - on view of mi1-mb.02-ma2e4 at the time when it is beginning to form stars , showing that the general morphology it develops is similar to that of run l256@xmath380.17 from paper i ( compare to fig .  4 of that paper , noting that the linear scales shown are different in each figure ) .",
    "we report the sfe as defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : sfe_def ] ) , with the `` dense '' gas defined as that with number density @xmath39 . however , because the sfe is actually a function of time , and sink formation begins at different times in different runs , in order to report a _ number _ for the sfe , we estimate it in two different ways .",
    "one is to measure the `` absolute '' sfe 25 myr after the start of the simulation , which we denote as sfe@xmath4 .",
    "the other is to measure the `` relative '' sfe , which we define as the sfe 5 myr after the onset of star formation in the simulation , and which we denote as sfe@xmath5 .",
    "this is actually close to the `` star formation rate per free - fall time '' , sfr@xmath40 ( after sf has begun ) , as defined by @xcite , since the free - fall time for gas at @xmath41 is @xmath42 myr .",

    "both sfes are seen to decrease with increasing @xmath22 , apparently due to an increase of the turbulent velocity dispersion @xmath49 as the inflow speed increases , which in turn reduces the sfr . ]",
    "we now consider the response of the sfe to the amplitude of the initial turbulent velocity field .",
    "note that this field was not originally intended to produce density condensations on its own , but just to sufficiently disorganize the inflow velocity field as to trigger the instabilities that render the cloud turbulent .",

    "this appears to be due to the stronger fragmentation induced by the turbulent velocity field , which in the extreme case of mi1-mb.27-ma2e4 almost obliterates the inflows , and produces scattered clumps througout the simulation box , with very little remaining of the cloud formed by the inflows , as illustrated in fig.[fig : runs3_11_img ] , _ left panel_.    it is also worth noting that run mi0-mb.10-ma2e4 , which has no inflows , has a much larger @xmath19 and a lower @xmath46  than run mi1-mb.11-ma2e4 , which differs from the former only in the presence of the inflows .",

    "[ fig : runs3_11_img ] , this run also produces scattered clumps throughout the numerical box , although not as profusely as mi1-mb.27-ma2e4 .",
    "so , we conclude that sink formation is still dominated by the colliding streams in mi1-mb.11-ma2e4 , although a small fraction of the sinks is contributed by the global turbulence .",

    "a clear trend of a decreasing sfe ( seen in both sfe@xmath4  and sfe@xmath5 ) with increasing @xmath1 is seen , which we interpret as a result of the reduction of the fragment mass with increasing turbulence strength ( at constant total mass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and of the fact that smaller - mass fragments tend to have smaller sfes (  [ sec : sfe_vs_rinf ] ) .        and sfe@xmath5  on the rms mach number , @xmath1 , of the initial ( background ) turbulent velocity perturbations .",

    "the last dependence of the sfe we analyse is on the mass content of the colliding inflows .",
    "so , we consider inflows of various radii . however , since a very narrow inflow is necessarily more poorly resolved , we consider smaller simulation boxes in two of the cases , in order to better resolve the resulting clouds . specifically , as shown in table [ tab : run_params ] , @xmath23 in run mi1-mb.02-ma5e3 is half that in mi1-mb.02-ma2e4 .",
    "run mi1-mb.06-ma2e3 has @xmath23 equal to that of mi1-mb.02-ma5e3 , but half the length , since the numerical box size of the former is half that of the latter .",
    "finally , mi1-mb.06-ma6e2 has @xmath23 equal to half that of mi1-mb.06-ma2e3 .",
    "so , the total mass contained in the inflows of runs mi1-mb.02-ma2e4 , mi1-mb.02-ma5e3 , mi1-mb.06-ma2e3 and mi1-mb.06-ma6e2 is , respectively , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",

    "we see that there is a general trend for the sfe , in both its forms , to increase with the total mass involved in the stream collision .",
    "there is only a reversal to this trend in the relative sfe between runs mi1-mb.02-ma2e4 and mi1-mb.02-ma5e3 because the latter has a large early maximum of sfe@xmath5 , although later it decreases , in a period of mass accumulation in the cloud at low sfr .",

    "in this paper , we have considered the scenario of molecular cloud formation by wnm stream collisions , and investigated the dependence of the sfe on three parameters of this scenario , namely the inflow speed , the rms mach number of the background medium , and the total mass contained in the inflows . since the sfe , defined as in eq.([eq : sfe_def ] ) , is a time - dependent function because the cloud continues to accrete mass from the wnm while it forms stars , we have considered two estimators of its time integral , namely the absolute sfe after 25 myr from the start of the simulation , sfe@xmath4 , and the `` relative '' sfe , 5 myr after the onset of sf in the cloud , denoted sfe@xmath5 .",
    "we have found a wide range of values of these estimators as we vary the parameters of the simulations . in general , the sfe decreases , although moderately , with increasing inflow velocity . in particular , sfe@xmath5decreases from @xmath7 to @xmath82 as @xmath0 increases from 1.25 to 3.5 .",
    "note that the runs in this case have similar sfrs , and the decrease in the sfe and @xmath46  is due to the faster increase in cloud mass rather than to a decrease in the sfr . that the sfr is similar in all three runs , in spite of the larger gas mass is probably due to the larger turbulent velocity dispersion in the dense gas caused by the larger inflow speed , which tends to inhibit the sfr , thus compensating the tendency to have a larger sfr due to the larger cloud masses .",
    "similarly , the sfe decreases with increasing background turbulence strength , as the latter progressively takes a dominant role in the production of the dense gas but , due to the relatively small scales at which the turbulence is excited , the clouds and clumps formed by it are significantly smaller than the cloud formed by the coherent stream collision . in this case ,",
    "sfe@xmath5  decreases from @xmath7 to @xmath83 as the rms mach number of the background turbulence increases from @xmath84 to @xmath85 .    finally , the sfe in general decreases with decreasing mass of the inflows ( at constant @xmath22 ) .",
    "this may be a consequence of the fact that clouds formed by the collision of our inflows always have roughly the same density , temperature , and velocity dispersion , so smaller clouds are more weakly gravitationally bound , a condition known to decrease the sfe @xcite .",

    "1986 ) to that of a cluster - forming core ( @xmath89 ; sfe @xmath85  0.5 , lada & lada 2003 ) , because in this case the cores mean densities are much larger than those of the gmcs , while in our case the mean densities of the various clouds are always comparable .",
    "thus , our clouds do not conform to larson s ( 1981 ) density - size scaling .",
    "the latter results , expressed in terms of the virial parameter @xmath11 , exhibit partial agreement with the prediction by km05 for the dependence of the sfe after a free - fall time ( what those authors called the star formation rate per free - fall time , or sfr@xmath40 ) , which is directly comparable to our sfe@xmath5 .",
    "although their prediction , without any rescaling , lies in the same range of values as our observed efficiencies , it contains a much shallower dependence on @xmath11 than we observe .",
    "this may be due to the fact that those authors assumed that the clouds were supported by turbulent pressure , possibly provided by stellar feedback , while our simulations lack such support .",
    "however , the notion of turbulent support has been questioned recently by @xcite , and the low observed efficiency may be the result of the _ dispersal _ ( rather than support ) of the parent cloud by its stellar products @xcite .",
    "more work is needed to determine the causes of the discrepancy .",
    "however , it is noteworthy that run mi1-mb.06-ma2e3 , which has a value of @xmath11 closest to unity , has a reasonably realistic value of sfe@xmath5@xmath90% .",
    "we conclude that the sfe , even in the absence of further agents such as magnetic fields and stellar feedback , is a highly sensitive function of the parameters of the cloud formation process , and may be responsible for significant intrinsic scatter in observational determinations of the sfe .",

    "<S> because the sfe is a function of time , we define two estimators for it , the `` absolute '' sfe , measured at @xmath3 myr into the simulation s evolution ( sfe@xmath4 ) , and the `` relative '' sfe , measured 5 myr after the onset of star formation in each simulation ( sfe@xmath5 ) . the latter is close to the `` star formation rate per free - fall time '' for gas at @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that both estimators decrease with increasing @xmath2 , although by no more than a factor of 2 as @xmath0 increases from 1.25 to 3.5 . </S>",
    "<S> increasing levels of background turbulence ( injected at scales comparable to the streams transverse radius ) similarly reduce the sfe , because the turbulence disrupts the coherence of the colliding streams , fragmenting the cloud , and producing small - scale clumps scattered through the numerical box , which have low sfes . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the sfe is very sensitive to the mass of the inflows ( at roughly constant density and temperature ) , with sfe@xmath5  decreasing from @xmath7 to @xmath8 as the mass in the colliding streams decreases from @xmath9 to @xmath10 or , equivalently , the virial parameter @xmath11 increases from @xmath12 to @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> this trend is in partial agreement with the prediction by @xcite , since the latter lies within the same range as the observed efficiencies , but with a significantly shallower slope . </S>",
