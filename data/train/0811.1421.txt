    "neutrino - induced one - pion production off nucleons and nuclei in the intermediate energy region is a source of relevant data on hadronic structure .",
    "pions are mainly produced through resonance excitation and these reactions can be used to extract information on nucleon - to - resonance axial transition form factors .",
    "besides , a proper understanding of these processes is very important in the analysis of neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "for instance , @xmath2 production by neutral currents ( nc ) is the most important @xmath3-induced background to experiments that measure @xmath4 oscillations in the neutrino energy range around @xmath5  gev  @xcite .",
    "this is because nc @xmath2 events can mimic @xmath6 signal events when , for example , one of the two photons associated with the @xmath7 decay is not detected .",
    "this can happen when a photon exits the detector before showering or does not have enough energy to initiate a shower .",
    "similarly , @xmath8 production by charged currents ( cc ) is an important source of background in @xmath9 disappearance searches  @xcite .    in reactions on nuclei ,",
    "pions can be produced incoherently or coherently . in the latter case",
    "the nucleus remains in its ground state .",
    "coherent reactions are controlled by the nucleus form factor and are more forward peaked than incoherent ones .",
    "cc coherent pion production has been studied at higher energies in a number of experiments  @xcite .",
    "the results could be satisfactorily explained by the rein ",
    "sehgal model  @xcite which is based on the partially conserved axial current ( pcac ) hypothesis  @xcite .",
    "the k2k collaboration has recently conducted a search for cc coherent pion production induced by muon neutrinos with a mean beam energy of @xmath10 gev  @xcite .",
    "contrary to expectations , they found no evidence for cc coherent pion production , setting an upper limit of 0.60% for the coherent to total cc pion production ratio .",
    "the data show a deficit of forward muons in the kinematical region where a sizable coherent production is expected .",
    "an attempt to explain this deficit has been done by rein and sehgal in ref .",
    "@xcite by including in their model the usually neglected finite muon mass effect  @xcite . in this way they find a @xmath11 suppression caused by the destructive interference between the axial vector and pseudoscalar ( pion - pole ) amplitudes , reducing in this way the discrepancy between theory and experiment , though it still persists .",
    "this correction affects only cc processes and its relevance is reduced as the neutrino energy increases  @xcite .",
    "the negative k2k results are consistent with a very recent search performed by the sciboone collaboration  @xcite .",

    "sehgal model  @xcite mentioned above assumes that coherent pion production is dominated by the divergence of the axial current  @xcite and can thus be related to the pion - nucleus coherent scattering via pcac .",
    "extrapolation to non - forward angles is done by including a propagator term @xmath18 with @xmath19gev .",
    "the effects on the model of considering a finite muon mass was recently analysed in refs .",
    "@xcite and , as stated above , they give rise to a @xmath20 reduction of the cc coherent pion production by muon neutrinos at low neutrino energies .",
    "however , one should note that the rein ",
    "sehgal model does not account for nuclear pion absorption , since it does not consider two body mechanisms which are those responsible for the absorption of the outgoing pions , and it does not correctly treat quasielastic collisions either . besides , the corrections to the outgoing pion angular dependence predicted by the model become quite important for the low neutrino energies relevant in miniboone and t2k experiments , as we will show in subsect .",

    "<S> we have developed a model for neutrino - induced coherent pion production off nuclei in the energy regime of interest for present and forthcoming neutrino oscillation experiments . </S>",
    "<S> it is based on a microscopic model for pion production off the nucleon that , besides the dominant @xmath0 pole contribution , takes into account the effect of background terms required by chiral symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the model uses a reduced nucleon - to-@xmath0 resonance axial coupling , which leads to coherent pion production cross sections around a factor two smaller than most of the previous theoretical estimates . in the coherent production , </S>",
    "<S> the main nuclear effects , namely medium corrections on the @xmath0 propagator and the final pion distortion , are included . </S>",
    "<S> we have improved on previous similar models by taking into account the nucleon motion and employing a more sophisticated optical potential . as found in previous calculations the modification of the @xmath0 self - energy inside the nuclear medium </S>",
    "<S> strongly reduces the cross section , while the final pion distortion mainly shifts the peak position to lower pion energies . </S>",
    "<S> the angular distribution profiles are not much affected by nuclear effects . </S>",
    "<S> nucleon motion increases the cross section by @xmath1% at neutrino energies of 650 mev , while coulomb effects on charged pions are estimated to be small . finally , we discuss at length the deficiencies of the rein  </S>",
    "<S> sehgal pion coherent production model for neutrino energies below 2 gev , and in particular for the miniboone and t2k experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we also predict flux averaged cross sections for these two latter experiments and k2k . </S>"
