    "there is a number of quantum many - body problems that are of fundamental physical importance and , at the same time , possess an exact solution .",
    "these are the anderson orthogonality catastrophe@xcite , fermi edge singularity@xcite ( fes ) , luttinger liquid@xcite ( ll ) zero - bias anomaly@xcite , and kondo problems@xcite .",

    "we have developed a non - equilibrium bosonization technique generalizing the conventional bosonization @xcite onto problems with non - equilibrium distribution functions .",
    "we have shown that the relevant correlation functions can be expressed through fredholm determinants of `` counting '' operator .",
    "the information on the specific type of the problem , as well as on different aspects of the interaction , is encoded in the time - dependent scattering phase of the counting operator .",
    "the findings of refs .   have demonstrated that the above classical many - body problems are even more closely connected than has been previously understood , extending the interrelations into the non - equilibrium regime .",
    "the `` counting '' operators governing the simplest ( one - particle ) non - equilibrium green functions in the above models can be reduced to toeplitz matrix form upon regularization and discretization @xcite .",
    "the electron energy distribution function then determines the symbol of the toeplitz matrix .",
    "the most interesting situation arises when the distribution function has multiple steps ( `` fermi edges '' ) , which results in step - like singularities of the symbol .",

    "this yields also terms with subleading power - law factors .",
    "while these terms are formally smaller ( as compared to the leading term ) when one considers the green function in the time representation , they contain different oscillatory exponents . therefore , after a transformation to the energy representation , they produce power - law singularities at different edges , which makes these terms physically important . the extended version of the fisher - hartwig conjecture is also expected to be of interest from the purely mathematical point of view .    in the present paper",
