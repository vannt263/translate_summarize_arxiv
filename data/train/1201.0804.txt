    "the deconfined criticality@xcite is arousing much attention recently.@xcite naively,@xcite the ( ground - state ) phase transition separating the nel and valence - bond - solid ( vbs ) phases is discontinuous , because the adjacent phases possess distinctive order parameters such as the sublattice magnetization and the dimer - coverage pattern , respectively .",
