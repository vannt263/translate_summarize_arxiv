    "suppose @xmath1 people want to select a loser by flipping coins : all of them flip their coin and those that flip heads are winners . the others continue flipping until there is a single loser .",

    "it is known that the probability of failure does not converge as @xmath0 increases .",

    ", we put such problems into a mild probabilistic framework and explain why this phenomenon of non - convergence is not surprising . the fact that in each round about the same fraction @xmath2 of the players survives is the key ingredient to get oscillation instead of convergence . in the loser selection problem and the shooting problem",
    "the fluctuations around the fixed fraction are of order @xmath3 .",
    "we demonstrate that non - convergence of a self - averaging sequence is natural to expect under a much weaker condition : if the fluctuations are of order strictly less than @xmath0 , the sequence should be expected not to converge .",

    "particular details of the problem do not really play a role in these bounds .    to illustrate our general results , we applied our methods to the group russian roulette problem .",
    "we obtain quite sharp upper and lower bounds on the liminf and limsup of the sequence of probabilities .",
