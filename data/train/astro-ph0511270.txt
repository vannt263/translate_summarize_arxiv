    "the optical counterpart is the o89 star bq  cam @xcite .",
    "analysis of the _ tenma _ data revealed a spectral shape similar to that seen in other accreting x - ray pulsars with a flat power law , an exponential cutoff , and a cyclotron resonant scattering feature ( crsf ) at an energy of @xmath128kev . in 1989",
    "september the source experienced another outburst , this time observed by _ ginga _ @xcite . with the energy range of the large area counters",
    "adjusted to cover the 260kev range , crsfs were detected at 28.5 and 53kev .",

    "during the decline phase , the observed fluxes first decay exponentially up to mjd53412 , followed by a linear decrease ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : flux ] ) .",
    "the decay timescales are different at lower and higher energies : while a decay time of 30d is observed above 20ke-0.09em v , it is only 20d below 15ke-0.09em v. such behavior is typically observed in systems where an irradiated disk is present which , however , is not the case for v0332@xmath053 . since @xmath2 , this picture suggests that @xmath3 .",
    "the transition to the linear phase would then be triggered by a yet unknown change in the disk .",
    "to study the evolution of the spectrum over the outburst , we used the simple model , modified by two gaussian absorption lines to model the crsfs at @xmath127ke-0.09em vand @xmath151ke-0.09em vfor all observations .",
    "while the folding energy remains constant at @xmath17.5ke-0.09em v , the power law index @xmath4 decreases from @xmath5 in the first observation to @xmath6 in the last observations  the spectrum of v0332@xmath053hardens over the outburst .",

    "integral_observation to 29.5ke-0.09em vin the last observations .",
    "moreover , during the previous _ rxte_observation , the fundamental crsf was observed at 26.3ke-0.09em v@xcite resulting in a total increase of more than 3ke-0.09em v. this change is highly significant : fitting the last _ integral_observations with a crsf energy fixed to 27.5ke-0.09em vresults in strong residuals and a completely unacceptable fit .",
    "the same holds true for the continuum : fixing the other continuum parameters also results in unacceptable fits .",
    "the determination of the parameters of the second crsf , however , is problematic for the second half of the observations as with decreasing flux , statistics become poor .",
    "the exponential decay of the flux and the transition to a linear phase later is frequently observed in sxts and dwarf novae @xcite .",
    "while the emission mechanism is entirely different for v0332@xmath053 , the similarity is striking and a yet unidentified change in the disk can be assumed to trigger the transition to the linear phase . the luminosity dependence of the energy of crsfs had already been observed previously @xcite and was assumed to be due a change in height of the crsf formation region in the accretion column . based on our data , we derive a change in height of @xmath1300 m ; however , a slightly different picture is also possible : the crsf emission region can be assumed to be extended along the accretion column .",
    "the observed broad crsfs would then be superposition of many narrower lines , each from a different height in the column . as the accretion rate drops , the extend of the emission region and its height both decrease and hence the energy of the crsf increases while it gets narrower as is observed for v0332@xmath053(see fig .",
