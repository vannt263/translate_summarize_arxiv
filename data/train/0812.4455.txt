    "the power laws and scaling behaviour are present in numerous aspects of human societies and in the nature",
    ". one of the first promoters of the concept of the power law was vilfredo pareto ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , who studied the wealth distribution in different societies . further , harvard linguistics professor george zipf , again a representative of social sciences , observed that only few words in english language are used very often , and most of the words are used rarely .",
    "nowadays , physicists are very used to the power - laws , which , however , are sometimes somewhat counter - intuitive .",
    "indeed , the presence of a power - law means that there are some representatives of a population , which are very different from the typical members of that population .",
    "for example , as the result of a social evolution , the wealth of a single individual can qualitatively change the wealth of a large community .",
    "this is completely different from the biological evolution : e.g. the weight of a single living creature makes always only a tiny contribution to the net biomass of the corresponding ( non - small ) population .",
    "the presence of a wide spectrum of power laws in finances can be ascribed to the fact that socially interacting humans form large complex systems , which are characterized by self - organized criticality @xcite .",
    "this makes finances ( alongside with the turbulence ) a fruitful polygon for studying various aspects of scale - invariance .",
    "indeed , various power - laws have been observed in financial time series since 1960-es , by b. mandelbrot ( cf .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . in 1999 ,",
    "ausloos and ivanova also reported the multifractality in financial time series ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . around 1990-ies ,",
    "the studies of scale - invariance in finances became more extensive , c.f .",
    "@xcite , effectively creating a new branch of statistical physics  the _ econophysics_. a recent overview of the progress in understanding the scaling and its universality in finances can be found in ref .",
    "the aim of the current study is to contribute to the _ understanding of the origins of universality_. mathematically , our basic idea is very simple , nearly trivial .",
    "however , when dealing with the sources of universality , mathematically simple and robust models have better chances of describing reality , than complex and elaborate constructions ; c.f . the occam s razor .    the attempt to successfully and systematically predict the direction of future movements of asset prices",
    "can be compared to the attempts of inventing the _ perpetum mobile_. however , the attempt to characterize and predict the risk ( or volatility ) may offer significantly better results and therefore the volatility is one of the most - studied phenomena in econophysics .",
    "one of the most challenging features of the volatility dynamics are the intermittently appearing extreme price movements , which are often accompanied by overall increase of volatility over a certain time window .",
    "traditionally , such a behaviour has been described by multifractal spectra .",
    "the multifractal analysis is untoubtedly a powerful tool ; however , due to the involved mathematical methods , it is not well - suited for practical applications of the prediction and optimisation of risks .",
    "this observation motivated us to introduce a complementary method of the length - distribution analysis of the _ low - variability periods _ @xcite .",
    "the low - variability periods are defined as consequent time periods , during which the price changes of the observed asset ( as compared to the local average over a sliding window of width @xmath0 ) remains under a pre - set threshold @xmath1 .",
    "the illustration of the method is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tau ] .",
    "this method ( with certain modifications ) was developed independently within different contexts , and put under extensive tests by several research groups .",
    "so , the effects of the long - term memory and clustering of extreme events in various time series ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , are , in fact , closely related to ( and in a certain sense covered by ) the low - variability period analysis .",
    "the same applies to the studies of the time intervals @xmath2 between _ volatilities _ which are above a threshold @xmath3 @xcite ) .     of the dax index and the respective low - variability periods for 4 years ( 2003 - 2007 ) , using @xmath4 day ( a ) and @xmath5days ( b ) . for a pre - fixed threshold level @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 is the standard deviation of the signal ) , low - variability intervals of duration @xmath8 are formed as the intervals corresponding to such graph segments , which lay entirely inside the gray area .",
    "the small graphs in top share the time axis with the bottom graph , and illustrate the fragmentation of them into low - variability intervals by plotting the interval index @xmath9 versus time @xmath10.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    our previous studies @xcite and @xcite have shown that    * financial time - series are typically characterized by multi - scaling behaviour of the low - variability periods ( power law can be observed for a certain range of the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 , and the scaling exponent depends on these parameters ) ; * theoretically , a multi - fractal time - series follows also a multi - scaling behaviour of the low - variability periods ; the scaling exponent can be expressed via the multifractal exponents ; * as compared to the multifractal analysis , the analysis of the low - variability periods is easier to implement , has higher resolution of time - scales , and the results of the analysis can be interpreted more straightforwardly .",
    "these findings agree well with the above cited independent studies .",
    "the market fluctuations have been also modelled as l ' evy flights and continuum time random walks ( ctrw ) ; therefore it is also of interest to mention that in the case of uncorrelated l ' evy flights , there is no power - law for the length - distribution of the low - variability periods : length - distribution decays exponentially ; the same applies to gaussian time - series , e.g. ( non)persistent random walks .",
    "meanwhile , in the case of ctrw , there is a mono - scaling behaviour of the low - variability periods : the scaling exponent does not depend on the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 , and is defined by the exponent of the waiting - time distribution @xcite .",
    "in addition to the above listed results , we have shown @xcite that the very presence of a power - law for the probability distribution function of the low - variability segment lengths ( even if observed for a narrow range of the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 ) bears interesting consequence : the probability @xmath11 of observing a large movement ( exceeding the threshold parameter @xmath1 ) in the time series during the next period of duration @xmath0 , is inversely proportional to _ the length of the on - going low - variability period _ ( i.e. to the time elapsed since the most recent large movement ; note that by definition , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 would imply that for the given parameters , the next price movement exceeds definitely the threshold @xmath1 ) .",
    "this super - universal scaling law has been derived independently by bogachev , _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "here we repeat the derivation briefly .",
    "first , we assume that the length of the periods is measured in the units of the window length @xmath0 .",
    "then , the probability of a large movement during the unit time is given by the ratio of _ ( a ) _ the number of those low - variability periods , the length of which is exactly @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and _",
    "( b ) _ the number of those low - variability periods , which have length @xmath16 , @xmath17 . here",
    ", @xmath18 denotes the cumulative length - distribution function of the low - variability periods with length equal to @xmath14 [ i.e.  @xmath18 represents the number of low - variability periods with length greater or equal to @xmath14 time units ] .",
    "so , we can express the probability of `` silence - breaking '' ( i.e. the probability that the next movement exceeding the threshold @xmath1 ) as a function of the on - going `` silent '' period @xmath14 : @xmath19/r(n).\\ ] ] if @xmath14 is large , the difference @xmath20 can be calculated approximately as @xmath21 . upon applying the power - law @xmath22 ,",
    "we arrive at @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "bearing in mind that @xmath25 , the final result is written as @xmath26 since the scaling exponent of this law is independent of the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 ( as well as of the scaling exponent @xmath27 ) , it can be called super - universal . the equation ( [ silence ] ) can be also denoted as _ the law of the silence - breaking probability _ , because it describes the probability of a large movement after a longer `` silent '' period ( characterized by small movements ) .",
    "recently , similar application of the risk measurement was proposed by wang , _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "as demonstrated above , the mathematics behind this super - universal law is extremely simple .",
    "however , we do believe that the consequences of it are profound , and it allows to shed light into the origin of universality in the dynamics of market fluctuations .",
    "in fact , a very similar behaviour ( with a similar mathematical origin ) has been detected in the context of direct avalanches in self - organised critical systems ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) , and proven to be a useful tool in understanding the universality in burst dynamics . these arguments motivated us to put equation ( [ silence ] ) under several tests , using both the data of real market fluctuations , as well as the surrogate data . _",
    "the aim is to clarify , how well is the super - universal law followed by the real - world time - series _ , for which the scaling laws are far from being perfect ( and is for certain applications better described , e.g. , by stretched exponentials @xcite ) , and for which the finite - size effects can ( possibly ) mask the theoretical scaling behaviour . in order to show the presence of the @xmath28-law in relatively short time - series ( with unavoidably poor statistics of long low - variability periods ) ,",
    "an appropriate data analysis technique has been developed ( see section [ constraints ] )",
    "further we proceed to test empirically the probability of the `` silence - breaking '' . as changes in financial markets",
    "are believed to obey power - laws ( @xcite ) , we use several financial time series ( cf . table [ data ] ) in order to test the equation ( [ silence ] ) .",
    "some of these data are presented visually in fig .",
    "[ fig : spx - signal ] .",
    "we also test the equation ( [ silence ] ) with artificially generated time series ( i.e. surrogate data with known properties , see appendix ) , which obey a power - law .     of s&p  500 ( b ) , german stock index dax ( c ) , and nikkei 225 index ( d),scaledwidth=100.0% ]    .the data used in empirical analysis ( source of all the data series is bloomberg ) [ cols=\"<,<,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the empirical tests of eq .",
    "( [ silence ] ) were conducted as follows : @xmath29 we count the number of low - variability periods @xmath18 with length equal to @xmath14 ; @xmath30 we calculate the probability @xmath31/r(n)$ ] and @xmath32 plot it against @xmath14 . in order to make the data presentation visually easier to understand , we modify step @xmath32 by replacing @xmath33 with @xmath34 . thus , should the equation ( [ silence ] ) hold , the plot of @xmath34 against @xmath14 should yield a horizontal line .      before proceeding to the results of the tests outlined above",
    ", it should be noted that the probability of silence - breaking can not be expected to hold for all the values of @xmath14 .",
    "we explain this claim in more details .    1 .",
    "let us recall that in order to derive the scaling law ( 2 ) , we approximated @xmath20 with @xmath21 ; this is , however , legitimate only for large values of @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , one can expect that the super - universal power law ( 2 ) fails for small values of @xmath14 .",
    "the surrogate data analysis confirms that this is , indeed , the case , see fig .",
    "[ fig : surrogate - alphas ] .",
    "using numerically generated very long data - series [ which correspond to the distributions @xmath35 , we have calculated the quantity @xmath34 , and plotted it against @xmath14 ; in a full agreement with the theoretical expectations , it reaches asymptotically ( for @xmath36 ) a plateau with a limit value @xmath37 .",
    "+   is calculated for very long surrogate data series , and plotted against the length @xmath14 ; the results confirm the analytically predicted asymptotics @xmath38 for @xmath36,scaledwidth=70.0% ] 2 .",
    "the analysis of the empirical data shows that @xmath18 is not a smoothly decreasing function of @xmath14",
    ". instead , for larger values of @xmath14 , there are long plateaus with a constant value of @xmath18 .",
    "indeed , it is possible that for many values of @xmath14 , there is no low - variability periods with the given length @xmath14 .",
    "it is apparent that due to the finiteness of the data series , the higher values of @xmath14 offer less statistics , i.e. the likelihood of observing a low - variability period of a length , equal to a fixed and very high value of @xmath14 , is very low .",
    "consequently , if we apply eq .",
    "( 1 ) directly to the empirical data series , the resulting empirical probability estimates @xmath39 follow a very singular behaviour : there are sharp peaks at those values of @xmath14 , which happen to have a matching low - variability period ; between these peaks , @xmath40 .",
    "evidently , such a simple - minded data analysis is not suited for testing the scaling law ( 2 ) .",
    "+ perhaps the most straightforward solution here would be to average the empirical probability estimates over a sliding window of a suitable length .",
    "however , this is certainly not the easiest and most elegant route , because it raises several technical issues ( e.g. what is the best window width ; it should variable and increase with @xmath14 ) . here , we have proceeded as follows .",
    "first , we approximate the step - wise experimental distribution law @xmath18 with a piece - wise linear function @xmath41 .",
    "more specifically , for all these values of @xmath14 ( @xmath42 ) for which @xmath43 , we define @xmath44 ; for all the other values of @xmath14 we use a linear interpolation : for @xmath45 , we define @xmath46 then , we can apply eq .",
    "( 1 ) to the smoothed distribution function @xmath41 .",
    "finally , even if we apply the smoothing procedure as described above , for very large values of @xmath14 ( of the order of the length @xmath47 of the longest low - variability period ) , the statistical basis becomes so narrow that the function @xmath48/\\tilde r(n)$ ] will fluctuate with a very large amplitude .",
    "apparently , the statistical fluctuations around the theoretical power - law [ eq .  ( [ silence ] ) ]",
    "grow with @xmath14 ; these fluctuations set an effective upper limit for the empirical scaling range at @xmath49 .",
    "being guided by these considerations , we calculated the @xmath18-functions for all the empirical data series , and applied the linearization procedure according to eq .",
    "( [ piecewise - lin ] ) .",
    "the results for the s&p  500 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : p - n - spx-2stddev ] ; the graphs for our other empirical data series behave similarly .",
    "note that in fig .",
    "[ fig : p - n - spx-2stddev ] , we have limited the data to @xmath50 , due to the reasons discussed in the previous pragraph .",
    "as predicted theoretically , the grahps fluctuate around a constant value [ for the parameters of fig .",

    "is plotted for the s&p  500 index ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) and for the numerically generated time series ( of a similar length and with the same value of @xmath27 ) against the period length @xmath14 .",
    "these results are in a good agreement with the theoretical expectation : for @xmath54 , the graphs fluctuate around the asymptotical value @xmath55.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]",
    "using the financial time - series , as well as artificially generated ( surrogate ) data series , we have shown that the `` silence - breaking '' probability follows , indeed , a super - universal power law : the probability of observing a large movement is _ inversely proportional to the length of the ongoing low - variability period_. the usefulness of this result is not limited to the financial risk analysis , and helps to understand the origins of universality in the scaling behaviour of complex systems ; it can be also used to build a hierarchical risk prediction scheme ( for a spectrum of events of different amplitude ) .    on the one hand ,",
    "our result `` approves '' the common human tendency to forget those extreme events , which have happened a long time ago .",
    "indeed , we have shown that in any system producing a scale - invariant sequence of events of different amplitude , the probability of observing a large event on next day is inversely proportional to the time elapsed since the last large event .",
    "on the other hand , however , our finding does not void another universal property of power laws : sooner or later , there will be an event of an even larger amplitude .",
    "so , in the case of stock markets , we can conclude that if we have not seen a ten - percent - or - larger movement for the last 10  000 days , the probability of such a movement on next day can be estimated as @xmath56 .",
    "however , one should not be driven to a delusion : due to the multi - scaling nature of the stock market movements , even a movement of 20% can not be neglected ; nassim nicholas taleb ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) has compared such a delusion with the russian roulette with a revolver containing 500 bullet - holes : the fact that nothing has happened during the 100 first clicks on the trigger , does not make the game harmless : the 101@xmath57 click can be lethal .",
    "the support of estonian sf grant no .",
    "etf6121 is acknowledged .",
    "we would also like to thank prof .",
    "jri engelbrecht for fruitful discussions .",
    "in order to test the equation ( [ silence ] ) , artificial data with know statistical properties we generated as follows . to begin with , note that actual time - series are not needed ; instead , it suffices to generate the sequence of the durations @xmath8 ( @xmath58 ) of the low - variability periods .",
    "indeed , our aim is to analyse the `` silence - breaking '' probability @xmath33 for a fixed set of parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( without intention to repeat the test for the same time - series with different parameter values ) .",
