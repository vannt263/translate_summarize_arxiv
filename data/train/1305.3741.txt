    "in the field of nanoelectromechanical ( nem ) systems , nonlinear dynamic phenomena such as bifurcations and mode coupling are receiving increasing interest @xcite .",
    "in particular , graphene resonators  @xcite , are known to display strong geometric nonlinear conservative as well as nonlinear dissipative response  @xcite .",
    "this opens up for new device applications  @xcite as well as for fundamental research  @xcite .",
    "so far , however , much of the work on nonlinear dynamics has focused on one - dimensional systems with beam or string like behavior . in graphene resonator devices , the geometries have mostly been rectangular and doubly clamped .",
    "such resonators tend to suffer from inhomogeneous strain and ill defined mode - shapes  @xcite and can possess edge modes or scrolled edges degrading the quality factor  @xcite . to alleviate these problems , circular graphene drum resonators , which are edge and corner free , can be used .    treating a circular graphene resonator ( see figure  [ fig : sysfig ] ) as a membrane  @xcite , we derive analytic expressions for frequency tuning , kerr - constants and mode coupling coefficients as functions of prestress , radius , electrostatic pressure , and elastic parameters .",
    "knowledge of these coefficients is required when analyzing and designing experiments .",
    "the study of the nonlinear dynamics of membranes and thin shells has a long history in the field of applied mechanics and structural engineering .",
    "for instance the static deflection solutions corresponding to the hencky problem  @xcite and fundamental mode nonlinearity  @xcite , have been studied previously ; for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite . in nem - resonator experiments , typically only a few flexural resonant modes are excited and probed .",
    "the equations of motion for the normal mode coordinates @xmath0 , which are nonlinear due to the geometric nonlinearity , have the canonical form @xmath1 where @xmath2 represents external forcing .",
    "this form facilitates the description and analysis of the system dynamics . using first order perturbation theory , and comparing with finite elements simulations , we give closed expressions for @xmath3 and coupling constants @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we find that significant contributions to the frequency spectrum come from inclusion of the deflection - induced non - uniform tension .",
    "in particular it gives rise to frequency crossings , i.e. , an interchange of mode frequencies with increasing back - gate voltage .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : first , in section [ continsec ] , we present and discuss the validity of treating a graphene resonator as a membrane .",
    "then , in section [ statsec ] , we consider the problem of finding the static shape and accompanying non - uniform tension profile in the presence of a static back - gate voltage .",
    "we then , in section [ modeexpsec ] , reformulate the problem in terms of the coupled duffing equations  ( [ eq : gensystem ] ) , while section [ linsec ] treats the frequency spectrum of the lowest lying modes as well as the frequency tuning with back - gate voltage .",
    "finally , in section [ nonlinsec ] we calculate the quadratic and cubic nonlinear coupling constants appearing in ( [ eq : gensystem ] ) .",
    "we consider a circular mechanical resonator of radius @xmath6 made from a layer of graphene with a built - in uniform tensile stress @xmath7 and suspended a distance @xmath8 above a back - gate , as sketched in figure [ fig : sysfig ] .",
    "the external forces on the membrane stem from the gate bias voltage @xmath9 .",

    "since graphene has a very low bending rigidity , @xmath38 ev @xcite , the ratio between bending and stretching terms in  ( [ weqfirst ] ) is very small for the lowest lying flexural vibration modes , if a built - in tension is present @xcite .",
    "hence , we employ the membrane approximation where the bending rigidity is neglected .",
    "further , since the lowest frequencies of in - plane vibrations are typically one or two orders of magnitude larger than the frequencies of the lowest lying out - of - plane vibrations , we can treat the in - plane displacements adiabatically .",
    "hence , we drop the terms @xmath39 in ( [ reqfirst ] ) and ( [ phieqfirst ] ) and solve the ensuing equilibrium equations as functions of @xmath40 .    to solve the simplified in - plane problem",

    "to address the dynamics , we must solve the static problem to find the time - independent components of the deformation field which we denote by @xmath56 . as the load has axial symmetry , @xmath57 , while @xmath58 and @xmath59 are found from solving ( [ weqfirstad ] ) with @xmath60 . to this end",

    "the result from the uniform load approximation is shown in figure [ comsolstatic ] where the maximum displacement for the variational ansatz has been compared to finite element simulations using comsol multiphysics .",
    "the agreement between the analytical model and the numerical simulations under uniform load is very good , showing that the ansatz and disregarding the bending rigidity are valid approximations .",

    "a noteworthy result is that inclusion of the first order corrections leads to a decrease in frequency for modes with radial index @xmath116 .",
    "this yields frequency crossings as the static deflection is increased , an effect not captured by the monotonically increasing uncorrected frequencies @xmath117 .",
