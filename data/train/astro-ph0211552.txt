    "n49 is a bright supernova remnant ( snr ) in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) @xcite .",
    "the low metal abundances of n49 @xcite indicated a substantial mixture of the supernova ( sn ) ejecta material with the lmc interstellar medium ( ism ) , which is consistent with the relatively old dynamical age as derived to be @xmath25000 @xmath0 10000 yr @xcite .",
    "the most remarkable feature of n49 is strong enhancements of the optical / x - ray surface brightness in the south - east .",
    "this asymmetric intensity distribution has been attributed to the interaction of the blast wave with the nearby molecular clouds located in the east of the snr @xcite .",
    "the radio images show similar intensity distribution to the x - ray morphology , but with a complete shell in the west as well as in the east @xcite .",
    "the radio spectral index of @xmath3 = @xmath00.58 @xcite is typical for a shell - type snr .",
    "although the mean fractional polarization over the whole remnant is low ( @xmath45% ) , the western side of the snr is highly polarized . the highly organized magnetic field in the west of the snr is supportive of the less - disturbed blast wave expanding into the low density ism in the west @xcite .",

    "this dense ism is most likely associated with the co clouds detected in the east of the snr @xcite .",
    "the bright optical / uv emission arises from `` sheets '' of emission generated by slow radiative shocks of @xmath7 @xmath8 140 km s@xmath9 as the blast wave interacts with the dense ambient material , while the x - ray emission appears from the fast shock ( @xmath7 @xmath2 730 km s@xmath9 ) propagating in the intercloud medium .",

    "we have utilized the data reduction techniques developed at the pennsylvania state university for correcting the spatial and spectral degradation of the acis data caused by radiation damage , known as charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) @xcite .",
    "the expected effects of the cti correction include an increase in the number of detected events and improved event energies and energy resolution @xcite .",
    "we screened the data with the flight timeline filter and then applied the cti correction before further data screenings by status and grade .",

    "this point source is also detected in the off - axis image ( figure [ fig : fig1]a ) but appears extended because of the psf degradation . despite the superior angular resolution of the on - axis data , the selection of the subarray of the ccd allows only a partial coverage of the snr : i.e. , about a third of the snr in the south - west was not covered ( figure [ fig : fig1]b ) . the imaging and spectral analysis over",
    "the whole remnant is important to understand the global nature of the snr and we primarily utilize our gto data for the data analysis . in order",

    "[ fig : fig1 ] , the soft x - ray emission ( red - yellow ) reveals various filamentary structures across the snr .",
    "the circumferential shell - like soft x - ray features around the snr are spatially coincident with the radio shells ( figure [ fig : fig2]a ) , representing the blast wave shock front . by comparison ,",
    "the hard x - ray emission features show little correlation with the radio intensities ( figure [ fig : fig2]b ) . based on astrophysical considerations",
    ", we believe that it is reasonable to suppose that shocks are reflecting off the denser molecular gas in the east and may be propagating back into the interior of n49",
    ". this could be a partial explanation for the higher temperatures we find in the spectral analysis of the eastern region (  [ subsubsec : east ] ) , although a definitive conclusion would require a detailed investigation of the hydrodynamics of n49 that is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "other evidence , albeit more speculative , in support of reflected shocks in the eastern region of n49 include ( 1 ) the morphology of the hard x - rays which peak closer to the interior on the eastern side than the soft x - rays do ( figure [ fig : fig2 ] ) , and ( 2 ) the clear arc - like feature in the si ew map (  [ subsec : ew ] and figure [ fig : fig5]f ) which traces hot gas , that perhaps delineates the edge of the inward moving reflected shock .",
    "the western half is , for the most parts , dominated by hard x - ray emission ( green - blue ) , which may indicate that the blast wave is propagating through a low density ism , as suggested by radio data @xcite .",
    "the brightest diffuse emission is in the southeast , as recognized by previous x - ray observations , where the snr is interacting with dense molecular clouds .",
    "the overall bright x - ray emission in the eastern half of the snr is significant in all colors and likely has complex spectral structure .",
    "while filamentary soft , red - yellow emission prevails in the eastern half of the snr , there are apparent blue regions in the east ( primarily to the immediate north of the southeast brightest region ; figure [ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "this diffuse x - ray emission with spectral variations appears localized to produce spatially distinctive layers of x - ray colors in the eastern half of the snr .",
    "the interactions of the blast wave shock with the clumpy dense molecular clouds in these regions appear responsible for the observed spatio - spectral substructures of the diffuse x - ray emission ( see  [ subsec : spec ] ) .",
    "for example , the bright filametary emission features from the optical oiii images are largely anti - correlated with the blue , hard x - ray intensity and more correlated with the soft , red x - ray emission ( figure [ fig : fig3]a and figure [ fig : fig3]b ) .",
    "the optical emission from n49 is believed to originate primarily from slow radiative shocks entering dense molecular clouds , while the x - ray emission is in general from fast shocks propagating through the intercloud medium @xcite . the high resolution x - ray images from the acis data reveal that the hard x - rays are indeed from intercloud regions where little optical emission originates , and that the soft x - ray emission is spatially more coincident with the bright optical emitting regions .",
    "these features support the interactions of the blast wave with the clouds as the origin of the x - ray spectral variations observed in the color images .",
    "we detect an interesting , previously unknown feature of n49 with our _ chandra _ gto data : i.e. , the blue , hard x - ray knot in the southwest , beyond the main boundary of the snr ( figure [ fig : fig1]a ) , from which faint radio emission is also associated ( figure [ fig : fig2]b ) .",
    "the extended shape of this feature appears caused by the off - axis psf and the true morphological nature of this emission is uncertain with the current off - axis data .",
    "we can not utilize the high resolution archival data , because this feature lies outside the field of view ( figure [ fig : fig1]b ) .",
    "we find no proper counterparts for this feature in other wavelengths , which suggests that it is unlikely a projection of a background / foreground point source (  [ subsubsec : bullet ] ) .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of this feature indicates metal - rich thermal emission with strong atomic emission lines rather than a power law dominated spectrum (  [ subsubsec : bullet ] ) .",
    "these spectral features support the proposition that this hard x - ray knot is a part of the snr , probably fragment(s ) of sn ejecta .",
    "the overall spectrum of n49 shows some broad atomic emission lines ( figure [ fig : fig4 ] ) and we generate _ equivalent width _ ( ew ) images of k - shell line emission from the atomic elements o , ne , mg , si , s , and the l - shell line emission of fe by selecting photons around the broad line complexes ( table [ tbl : tab1 ] ) , following the methods described by park et al .",
    "( 2002a ) .",
    "images in the bandpasses of interest for both the lines and continuum were extracted with 2@xmath24 pixels and smoothed by a gaussian with @xmath25 = 7@xmath24 .",
    "the underlying continuum was calculated by logarithmically interpolating between images made from the higher and lower energy `` shoulders '' of each broad line .",
    "the estimated continuum flux was integrated over the selected line width and subtracted from the line emission .",
    "the continuum - subtracted line intensity was then divided by the estimated continuum on a pixel - by - pixel basis to generate the ew images for each element . in order to avoid noise in the ew maps caused by poor photon statistics near the edge of the snr",
    ", we have set the ew values to zero where the estimated continuum flux is low .",
    "we also set the ew to zero where the integrated continuum flux is greater than the line flux .",
    "we present the ew images for o , ne , mg , si , and fe ( figure [ fig : fig5 ] ) .",
    "the s ew image is unreliable due to the low photon statistics .",
    "the broad line complexes at @xmath20.8 @xmath0 1.1 kev are from various ionization states of ne k and fe l - shell line emission , and we present tentative identifications in figure [ fig : fig5 ] and table [ tbl : tab1 ] .",
    "although mg and si lines show he - like and h - like substructures in the overall spectrum ( figure [ fig : fig4 ] ) , we present the ew images from the combined broad lines in figure [ fig : fig5 ] since the h - like lines of these elements are too weak to separately produce useful ew images over the whole snr .",
    "the o ew distribution is generally consistent with the optical oi , iii intensity distributions and shows higher ew in the east and south of the snr ( figure [ fig : fig5]a ; vancura et al .",
    "1992 ) . the fe ew ( figure [ fig : fig5]d ) shows similar distribution to the o map .",
    "ne / fe and mg ew ( figure [ fig : fig5]b , figure [ fig : fig5]c , and figure [ fig : fig5]e ) distributions appear to be opposite to o , showing higher intensities in the west of the snr .",
    "the si ew is relatively strong in both east and west ( figure [ fig : fig5]f ) .",
    "the o and fe ew enhancements are spatially correlated with the location of the dense molecular clouds where the x - ray and optical emission is generally bright ( figure [ fig : fig5]a and figure [ fig : fig5]d ) . since the x - ray emission in these regions",
    "is presumably dominated by the shocked dense ism , these high o and fe ews are unlikely due to abundance enhancements , but appear to trace shock temperature variations .",
    "optical spectroscopic studies have indicated that metal abundances of n49 are close to the lmc values @xcite and support temperature variations , rather than abundances , as the origin of these ew distributions .",
    "based on the plane - parallel shock model with a moderate ionization timescale ( @xmath11 @xmath2 10@xmath26 @xmath6 s ) and the lmc abundances , the fe l ew ( figure [ fig : fig5]d ) is in fact representative of the broad line complex at @xmath27 @xmath2 0.8 kev , which is characteristic of a `` cool '' plasma ( @xmath10 @xmath28 0.5 kev ) as opposed to the `` hot '' component ( @xmath10 @xmath2 1 kev ) that would produce a prominent fe l line complex at @xmath27 @xmath21 kev .    in direct contrast , the h - like ne ( and/or hot fe l ) ew ( figure [ fig : fig5]c ) , which is sensitive to high temperatures of @xmath10 @xmath2 1 kev , is enhanced in the west where the blast wave is expanding into a low density ism .",
    "these ew distributions may thus indicate the presence of an _ undisturbed _",
    "( by dense ism ) blast wave shock in the west , which may have a higher temperature than that in the eastern side of the snr . if the dominant contributor to the enhanced ew at @xmath27 @xmath2 1.1 kev is ne , comparisons between he - like and h - like ne ew images ( figure [ fig : fig5]b and figure [ fig : fig5]c ) may suggest progressive ionizations of ne by the reverse shock as detected in other snrs @xcite .",
    "the si ew enhancements in both east and west are intriguing and may suggest the presence of hot phases in addition to cool phase shocks in the south - east parts of the snr ( see more discussion in  [ subsec : spec ] ) .",
    "the si ew enhancements in the southeastern quadrant are largely shell - like , as indicated by a dotted line in figure [ fig : fig5]f .",
    "this may also be interpreted as hot , highly ionized plasma in the southeastern regions of the snr .",
    "the hard x - ray knot in the southwest beyond the snr boundary , as revealed with the true - color image , shows strong enhancements in the si , mg , and hot ne / fe ew images .",
    "the actual spectral analysis indicates that these high ews are caused by metal abundances as well as advanced ionizations and high temperature ( see  [ subsubsec : bullet ] ) .",
    "the enhanced ews for the elemental species caused by high metal abundances support that this hard x - ray knot may not be a background extragalactic source , and that it is likely emission from metal - rich sn ejecta associated with n49 .",
    "the ew around the detected point source is , on the other hand , very low for all elemental species .",
    "these low ews are strong indications of the continuum - dominated x - ray spectrum for the point source .",
    "this is in good agreements with the presumed identification of the point source as the neutron star , or the x - ray counterpart of sgr 0526@xmath066 in the quiescent state .",
    "the high resolution acis data , for the first time , allow us to perform spatially - resolved spectral analysis in x - rays for the study of snr n49 . despite the psf degradations due to the large angular offset from the aim point , the gto data provide moderate angular resolution of a few arcsec , which are still sufficient to resolve major diffuse structure of n49 .",
    "moreover , the complete spatial coverage of the snr with the gto data is advantageous over the archival data for the efficient and consistent study of the global structures of the snr .",
    "combining two data sets may not be desirable because of the significant difference in the psf .",
    "we thus make a simple and secure approach for the spatially - resolved spectral analysis by utilizing the gto data as the primary data and the archival data as the supplementary data : i.e. , we perform all spectral analysis with the gto data and then verify the results with the archival data as necessary .",
    "we extract the spectrum from several small regions over the snr .",
    "the regional selections were based on the characteristics revealed by the broad band color images and the ew images , and are presented in figure [ fig : fig6 ] . in all spectral fittings , we made a low energy cut at the photon energy of @xmath27 = 0.5 kev because of unreliable calibrations of the acis spectrum in the soft bands .",
    "in most cases , we bin the data to contain a minimum of 20 counts for the spectral fitting . for the spectral analysis of our",
    "cti corrected data , we have utilized the response matrices appropriate for the spectral redistribution of the ccd , as generated by townsley et al .",
    "( 2002b ) .",
    "the low energy ( @xmath27 @xmath4 1 kev ) quantum efficiency ( qe ) of the acis has been degraded because of the molecular contamination on the optical blocking filter .",
    "we have corrected this time - dependent qe degradation by modifying the ancillary response function ( arf ) for each extracted spectrum by utilizing the idl version of acisabs software developed by chartas et al .",

    "we select three regions from the western half of the snr ( regions 1 , 2 , and 3 ; figure [ fig : fig6 ] ) .",

    "the fitted abundances for this region suggest that the high ew responsible for the emission line at @xmath27 @xmath2 1.1 kev ( figure [ fig : fig5]c ) is due to highly ionized h - like ne rather than hot fe .",
    "the best - fit shock temperature and the ionization timescale for this region are higher than region 1 in which he - like ne ew is enhanced ( figure [ fig : fig5]b ) .",

    "the ews distributions in the east of the snr are therefore more likely dominated by the shock temperature and the ionization states rather than by metal abundances .",
    "the fitted model parameters for the region 4 spectrum are also generally consistent with the results from region 5 , which also supports the temperature and ionization states for the origins of the observed ew distributions .",
    "we note that region 4 ews appear relatively weak for the atomic lines at low photon energies ( o and fe ; figure [ fig : fig5]a and figure [ fig : fig5]d ) and stronger in higher energies ( si ; figure [ fig : fig5]f ) compared with region 5 , even though there is no significant difference in the fitted shock parameters between these two regions .",
    "these features may imply a difference in the local interstellar environments due to the clumpy structure of the interacting dense molecular clouds : i.e. , a density gradient of the clouds between these two regions might have caused deficient soft x - ray emission in region 4 as displayed by the lack of red , soft emission there ( figure [ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the anticorrelations between optical and hard x - ray emission are supportive of this case .",
    "the fitted volume emission measure ( @xmath34 ) of the soft component plasma for the region 5 spectrum is indeed significantly higher than that for region 4 , which also supports this interpretation .",

    "follow - up on - axis observations with a decent exposure might be necessary to address the detailed nature of this feature .    the acis observations of n49 also firmly detect the x - ray counterpart of the quiescent phase of sgr 0526@xmath066 .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of sgr 0526@xmath066 is continuum dominated and can be fitted with a power law model .",
    "the implied photon index is @xmath1 @xmath2 3 .",
    "this power law spectrum is generally consistent with those from the axps although the observed @xmath13-ray burst of sgr 0526@xmath066 is a rare characteristic of typical axps .",
    "the authors thank j. dickel for providing his atca data .",
    "sp also thank a. bykov for a valuable discussion on the sn ejecta fragments .",
