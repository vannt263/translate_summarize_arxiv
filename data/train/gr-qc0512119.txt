    "the concept of a black hole is a central one in general relativity : spacetime is said to contain a black hole when it admits a complete null infinity whose past has a regular future boundary .",
    "this boundary is called the event horizon and the black hole itself is defined to be its future ; the past of null infinity is known as the black hole exterior .",
    "the simplest solutions of the einstein vacuum equations of general relativity , @xmath13 containing black holes , the one - parameter schwarzschild family of solutions , were written down in local coordinates  @xcite in 1916 , but only correctly understood as describing spacetimes with black holes in the sense above , around 1960 . until that time",
    ", there were many arguments in the physics literature ( e.g.  @xcite ) purporting to show that such solutions would be pathological and unstable .",
    "it was only when kruskal demonstrated  @xcite that the event horizon could be covered by regular coordinates that its true geometric character became clear , and the problem of stability could be given a sensible and well - defined formulation .",
    "the schwarzschild family turns out to be a sub - family of the two - parameter kerr family which describe stationary rotating black holes . in its proper rigorous formulation ,",
    "the problem of nonlinear stability of the kerr family is one of the major open problems in general relativity . at the heuristic level , however , considerable progress has been made in the last 40 years towards an understanding of the issues involved . in particular , a very influential role was played by the work of r.  price  @xcite in 1972 , who discovered a heuristic mechanism allowing for the decay of scalar field linear perturbations on the schwarzschild exterior .",
    "the mechanism depends on the following fact , known as the _ red - shift effect _",
    ", which had been understood previously in the context of geometric optics",
    ". given two observers @xmath14 and @xmath15 , depicted below .",
    "the reader unfamiliar with these diagrams can refer to  @xcite .",
    "] , @xmath16 then if @xmath14 emits a signal at a constant rate with respect to his own proper time , the frequency of the signal as received by @xmath15 is infinitely shifted to the red as @xmath15 s proper time goes to infinity .    for spherically symmetric solutions of the coupled einstein - scalar field system , and more generally",
    ", the einstein - maxwell - scalar field system , the heuristic picture put forth by price is now a theorem  @xcite , and the red - shift effect described above plays a central role in the proof .",
    "moreover , one of the results of  @xcite , namely the decay rate @xmath17 , has important implications for the causal structure of the interior of the black hole : in  @xcite , it is shown using @xmath18 that , in the charged case , the spacetimes of  @xcite do not generically terminate in everywhere spacelike singularities as originally widely thought , but rather , their future boundary has a null component across which the spacetime metric can be continuously extended . in particular",
    ", this implies that the @xmath19-inextendibility formulation  @xcite of strong cosmic censorship is false for the system considered .    for the einstein vacuum equations @xmath20 in the absence of symmetry assumptions , results analogous to  @xcite seem out of reach at present .",
    "clearly , a first step towards attacking geometric non - linear stability questions is proper understanding of the linear theory in an appropriate geometric setting",
    ". this will be the subject of the present paper .",
    "our main result is the following :    [ main ] let @xmath2 be a sufficiently regular solution of the wave equation @xmath21 on the ( maximally extended ) schwarzschild spacetime @xmath22 , decaying suitably at spatial infinity on an arbitrary complete asymptotically flat cauchy surface @xmath1 .",
    "fix retarded and advanced eddington - finkelstein coordinates @xmath5 and @xmath4 on one of the exterior regions . for any achronal hypersurface @xmath23 in the closure of this region , let @xmath24 denote the flux of the energy through @xmath23 , where energy is here measured with respect to the timelike killing vector field .",
    "let @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "we have @xmath29 ( we also allow @xmath23 to be a subset of null infinity , interpreted in the obvious limiting sense . ) in addition , we have the pointwise decay rates @xmath30    in the spherically symmetric case , the above result follows from a very special case of  @xcite .",
    "( see also  @xcite . )",
    "decay for @xmath2 , without however a rate , was first proven in the thesis of twainy  @xcite .",
    "the uniform boundedness of @xmath2 is a classical result of kay and wald  @xcite . for the more general kerr family ,",
    "even uniform boundedness remains an open problem ( see however  @xcite ) .",
    "we should also note that , independently of us , a variant of the problem considered here is being studied by @xcite .",
    "a statement of theorem  [ main ] in local coordinates will be given later .",
    "this , in particular , will explain the dependence on @xmath31 , and the minimum regularity assumptions necessary .",
    "the reader wishing to penetrate deeper into this problem , however , is strongly encouraged to learn the language necessary for the above geometric formulation .",
    "for neither the correct conditions on initial data , nor the desired statement of decay , have particularly natural formulations when stated with respect to regge - wheeler coordinates . corresponds to points in the actual spacetime .",
    "these issues are well known in the relativity community , and the reader should consult the nice discussion in  @xcite . ]",
    "the motivation for considering decay as stated in @xmath32 is that it is this formulation that has direct relevance both in the astrophysical regime , as well as for the fate of observers who enter the black hole region",
    ". for @xmath32 applied to @xmath33 gives decay rates for the energy radiated to infinity ( this is what is astrophysically observable ) , while applied to @xmath34 , it gives decay rates for the energy thrown into the black hole ( this is what concerns the observer entering the black hole ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the decay rates @xmath32@xmath35 are sufficiently fast so as to suggest that the picture established in  @xcite may remain valid in the absense of symmetry assumptions , in particular , the existence of a marginally trapped tube which becomes achronal and terminates at @xmath36 , and a weak null singular boundary component along the event horizon , for an @xmath37 . ] to spacetime , emanating from @xmath36 , across which the spacetime can still be continuously extended .",
    "the techniques of this paper are guided by the principle that they should be relevant for non - linear stability problems .",
    "for such problems , in the absence of symmetry , energy - type estimates have proven the most robust  @xcite . for lagrangian theories like the homogeneous wave equation ,",
    "such estimates naturally arise by contracting suitable vector fields @xmath38 with the energy - momentum tensor @xmath39 , to produce a one form @xmath40 .",
    "( see  @xcite for a general discussion . )",
    "the divergence theorem relates the spacetime integral of @xmath41 with suitable boundary terms .",
    "the method can be used to estimate the spacetime integral from the boundary terms , but also the future boundary terms from the past boundary and the spacetime integral .",
    "as we shall see below , both implications will be used here .",
    "let us recall the situation for the wave equation @xmath42 on minkowski space .",
    "the technique described here was introduced by morawetz , see @xcite and klainerman  @xcite . by applying the method of the previous paragraph to the killing vector field @xmath43",
    ", one obtains the usual energy conservation . by applying the method to the conformally killing `` morawetz '' vector field @xmath44 in the region @xmath45 , one obtains an identity relating a spacetime integral in this region to boundary integrals of weighted energy densities on @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the spacetime integral can be completely removed by a second application of the divergence theorem , which yields additional positive quantities on the boundary hypersurfaces . in particular , the weights are sufficient to derive decay of the form @xmath32 , assuming that the initial boundary integral is bounded .",
    "pointwise decay estimates of the form @xmath35 can then be obtained by sobolev inequalities , after commuting the equation with angular momentum operators @xmath48 .    turning to equation @xmath42 on the schwarzschild exterior",
    ", we have again a timelike killing vector field @xmath43 , and thus one immediately obtains conservation of the associated energy .",
    "applying as before the above method to the vector field and @xmath5 ] @xmath50 in the region @xmath45 , we again obtain boundary hypersurface integrals with a sign , and strong weights , in particular controlling @xmath51 times the energy density on @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath53 on the other hand , even after an additional integration by parts , the spacetime term arising from @xmath41 no longer vanishes . in the regions @xmath54 and @xmath55 , for certain constants @xmath56 , @xmath57 , however , this spacetime term has a good sign , and can be ignored . on the other hand , in the region @xmath58 ,",
    "it turns out the spacetime integral arising from @xmath50 can be controlled by @xmath59 times the spacetime integrals  summed  arising from vector fields @xmath60 of the form @xmath61 for a carefully chosen function @xmath62 , applied to each spherical harmonic @xmath63 , ( see also @xcite in connection with vector fields @xmath64 ) .",
    "in fact , for this bound , the vector fields @xmath60 must also be applied to angular derivatives of @xmath2 .",
    "this leads to loss of derivatives in the argument .. ] the boundary hypersurface integrals arising from @xmath60 are controlled in turn by the total energy .",
    "putting the information together from these two vector fields immediately yields energy decay @xmath32 , but with power @xmath65 in place of @xmath66 .",
    "the boundary integrals arising from the sum of the @xmath60 identities , when suitably localized to the future and past boundaries of a dyadic characteristic rectangle @xmath67 , can in fact be bounded by @xmath68 times the boundary integrals arising from @xmath50 on constant @xmath69 and @xmath70 hypersurfaces .",
    "using this fact , we can iterate the procedure , to obtain that the boundary integrals arising from @xmath50 are in fact bounded , and thus that @xmath32 holds as stated .",
    "the above methods do not give good control near the horizon @xmath71 .",
    "is normalized to @xmath72 . ] for this we need another estimate , which has no analogue in minkowski space .",
    "this estimate arises from applying a vector field of the form @xmath73 in the characteristic rectangle depicted .",
    "the @xmath4 length of this rectangle is chosen to be of the order of @xmath74 .",
    "note that @xmath75 extends regularly to the horizon @xmath71 .",
    "the boundary terms arising from @xmath75 are related to the energy that would be observed by a local observer crossing the event horizon .. ] the associated spacetime integral contains a term with a good sign , and terms that can be controlled by the sum of the spacetime integrals arising from the @xmath60 . as a first step , one can show using the energy identities for @xmath76 and @xmath60 , and the nature of the spacetime integral arising from @xmath75 , that the boundary terms arising from @xmath75 are uniformly bounded .",
    "then one can go back and , using a pigeonhole argument , extract from the term in the spacetime integral with a good sign a constant-@xmath4 slice of the rectangle such that the integral of the energy density as measured by a local observer is bounded by @xmath77 .",
    "finally , one applies again the energy identity of @xmath75 in a subrectangle to obtain that the integral of the energy density measured by a local observer is bounded by @xmath77 on the segment @xmath78 depicted .",
    "one repeats the procedure to obtain decay of @xmath51 .",
    "note that the procedure above for extracting decay for energy as measured by a local observer by means of a pigeonhole argument applied to the spacetime integral arising from the energy identity for @xmath75 is the analytic manifestation in our technique of the redshift effect described previously . here",
    ", the estimate is to be compared with the geometric optics argument of the first diagram , but where the observers @xmath14 and @xmath15 both cross the event horizon , with @xmath15 at advanced time @xmath77 later than @xmath14 .",
    "as in minkowski space , one obtains pointwise estimates @xmath35 from the @xmath79 estimates via the sobolev inequality , after commuting the equation with angular momentum operators .",
    "one should note however , that the necessary @xmath79 estimates near the horizon for the angular derivatives arise from the decay rate of @xmath51 for the energy flux measured by @xmath75 .",
    "the boundary terms of @xmath50 and @xmath43 do not contain angular derivatives on @xmath80 .",
    "our use of the vector field @xmath75 is inspired by estimates in  @xcite . in that paper",
    ", one could continue the iteration further to obtain better decay rates than @xmath32 , @xmath35 . here on the other hand , the weights on the boundary term arising from the morawetz identity give an upper bound to the amount of decay that can be extracted .",
    "it would be interesting to explore whether one can surpass this barrier using additional techniques .",
    "a final interesting aspect of our argument is that it does not require inverting the laplacian on initial data or appealing to the discrete isometries of schwarzschild .",
    "( in particular , the results here yield an independent proof of the classical uniform boundedness theorem  @xcite of kay and wald . )",
    "it may be useful for non - linear applications to avoid techniques so heavily dependent on the exact staticity . in this sense ,",
    "the argument given here is perhaps more robust .",
    "let @xmath22 denote the maximally extended schwarzschild spacetime with parameter @xmath81 .",
    "this manifold is spherically symmetric , i.e.  the group @xmath82 acts by isometry .",
    "we recally briefly the usual description of the global causal structure of @xmath83 , via its so - called penrose diagram .",
