    "let us shortly remind the main constructions of works  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "let there be given the universal covering of an oriented three - dimensional manifold , considered as a simplicial complex , in which every simplex is mapped into the three - dimensional euclidean space ( so that the intersections of their images in @xmath0 are possible ) . to each edge",
    "is assigned thus a euclidean length , and each tetrahedron has a sign `` plus '' or `` minus '' depending on orientation of its image in @xmath1 ; the defect angle ( minus algebraic sum of dihedral angles ) at each edge is equal to zero modulo @xmath2 .",
    "then we consider infinitesimal translations of vertices of the complex which lead to infinitesimal changes of edge lengths , while these latter lead , in their turn , to the infinitesimal changes of defect angles .",
    "thus , the following sequence of vector spaces arises : @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the lie algebra of motions of three - dimensional euclidean space ; @xmath5 is the space of column vectors of vertex coordinates differentials ; @xmath6 is the space of column vectors of edge length differentials ; @xmath7 is the space of column vectors of differentials of defect angles .",
    "the superscript @xmath8 means matrix transposition .",
    "matrices @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 consist of partial derivatives .",
    "one can see  @xcite that the sequence  ( [ eq : acycl1 ] ) is an algebraic complex ( superposition of two next matrices is equal to zero ) . besides , it is possible to show  @xcite that for manifolds with finite fundamental group this complex is acyclic .    for lens spaces we consider two sets of representations of fundamental group ( recall that @xmath12 ) :    @xmath13    the realization of representations @xmath14 was described in detail in  @xcite ( there",
    "they were denoted @xmath15 ) .",
    "as to representations @xmath16 , we will describe them below when we consider the structure of spaces entering in complex  ( [ eq : acycl1 ] ) .",
    ") , width=207,height=302 ]    in figure  [ fig : complex ] we show the simplicial complex ( bipyramid ) corresponding to the lens space @xmath17 .",
    "let index @xmath18 ( in figure ) vary from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "then gluing together @xmath21 bipyramids numbered by @xmath18 by identical vertices , edges and @xmath22-simplices we obtain an image of simplicial complex for @xmath23 in @xmath0 .",
    "every element of group @xmath24 can be represented in the group of motions of three - dimensional euclidean space as a rotation through angle @xmath25 around some axis which we denote @xmath26 .",
    "the integer parameter @xmath27 numbers the characters of these representations .",
    "thus , in the right cartesian coordinate system @xmath28 the coordinates of vertices of simplicial complex look like ( cf .  @xcite ) : @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 are some parameters that fix , to within the motions of @xmath0 , the location of vertices and hence all geometrical values of the complex such as edge lengths , volumes of tetrahedra , dihedral angles , etc .",
    "for instance , a simple calculation shows that the oriented volumes of tetrahedra are determined in this case by the formula : @xmath34    let us write out now more explicitly some of vector spaces entering in  ( [ eq : acycl1 ] ) ( due to the symmetry of the complex , it is enough for us to deal only with the first three of them ) : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are infinitesimal translations and rotations in the described above coordinate system @xmath28 .",
    "every element of group @xmath24 acts on spaces @xmath5 and @xmath6 by cyclic shifts as follows : it sends subspaces @xmath38 and @xmath39 to @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively .",
    "index @xmath42 changes from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "so , these actions completely determine representations @xmath16",
    ".    subspaces @xmath38 and @xmath39 look like ( all indexes are taken modulo @xmath21 ) : @xmath43    in general , matrices @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 specifying the mappings of vector spaces in complex  ( [ eq : acycl1 ] ) are not block - diagonal . in order to make them such we perform unitary change - of - basis transformations in all spaces entering in the complex .",
    "our goal is to split  ( [ eq : acycl1 ] ) into the direct sum of subcomplexes each of which would correspond to the character of some representation @xmath16 ( see  ( [ eq : gj ] ) ) .",
    "the unitarity of transformations is necessary to preserve the symmetric form  ( [ eq : acycl1 ] ) of the complex .",
    "let @xmath44 denote the primitive root of unity of degree @xmath21 .",
    "then    * the change - of - basis matrix in space @xmath4 is @xmath45 * the change - of - basis matrix in space @xmath5 is @xmath46 where @xmath47 * the change - of - basis matrix in space @xmath6 is @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the identical matrix of size @xmath50 .",
    "now , in an obvious way , @xmath51 and each of matrices @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 becomes block - diagonal ( the rearrangement of rows or / and columns can be required ) .",
    "thus , the acyclic complex  ( [ eq : acycl1 ] ) splits into the following direct sum of @xmath21 acyclic subcomplexes :    [ eq : acycl2 ] @xmath52    the superscript @xmath53 means operation of hermitian conjugation .",
    "we define the torsions of complexes  ( [ eq : acycl2 ] ) by formulas : @xmath54   \\bigl|(\\det { } _ { { \\mathcal d}_j}{\\vert } b_j   { \\vert}_{{\\overline { \\mathcal c}}_j } ) \\bigr| ^2 \\,(\\det   { } _ { { \\mathcal c}_j}{\\vert } a_j ) ^ { - 1 } , & j = 2 , \\ldots ,   p - 2 .",
    "\\end{cases}\\ ] ] here @xmath55 is a maximal subset of edges such that the restriction of matrix @xmath56 onto its corresponding subspace of @xmath6 ( we denote it as @xmath57 ) is nondegenerate .",
    "@xmath58 is the complement of @xmath55 .",
    "sets @xmath59 and @xmath60 consist of vertices and are defined similarly .    on the base of torsions  ( [ eq : torsions ] )",
    ", one can construct  @xcite invariant values not changing under the pachner moves @xmath61 and @xmath62 . in our case , these invariants take the form : @xmath63 here @xmath64 are usual euclidean edge lengths , @xmath65 are volumes of tetrahedra given by  ( [ eq : volumes ] ) .",
    "we use definition @xmath66 to emphasize that , in contrast with work  @xcite , here we deal with nontrivial representations @xmath14 .",
    "the calculations implied by formula  ( [ eq : invs1 ] ) are as follows . using acyclicity of complexes",
    ", we choose subsets @xmath55 and @xmath59 .",
    "then we calculate the corresponding minors of matrices @xmath56 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "in particular , we use the known expressions for partial derivatives @xmath69 ( see  @xcite for details ) . after this",
    ", we find the torsions according to  ( [ eq : torsions ] ) and substitute them into  ( [ eq : invs1 ] ) .",
    "the computer calculations which have been carried out for first several @xmath21 s allow us to suppose that the general formula for invariants of lens spaces  ( [ eq : invs1 ] ) looks as follows :    [ eq : invs2 ] @xmath70    where we have denoted @xmath71",
    "let us note once again that the value @xmath72 determined in  ( [ eq : deltam ] ) is nothing but the module of @xmath18th component of the reidemeister torsion of @xmath17 .",
    "it is of course very intriguing to calculate invariants of such kind for other 3- and 4-manifolds .    in the future we plan to investigate similar invariants based on @xmath73-solution of the pentagon equation  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
