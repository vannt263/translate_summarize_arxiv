    "gaudillire and landim @xcite derived a dirichlet principle for the capacity of non - reversible continuous - time markov chains , and slowik @xcite proved a thomson principle .    these advances in the potential theory of markov chains permitted to derive the metastable behavior of non - reversible dynamics .",
    "the metastable behavior of the condensate in a totally asymmetric zero - range process evolving on a fixed one - dimensional ring has been proved in @xcite , and misturini @xcite derived the metastable behavior of the abc model as the asymmetry increases .",

    "motivated by the evolution of mean - field planar potts model @xcite , whose dynamics can be mapped to a non - reversible cyclic random walk evolving on a potential field in a simplex , as the mean - field ising model @xcite is mapped to a one - dimensional reversible random walk on the interval , we examine in this article the metastable behavior of non - reversible cyclic random walks evolving in a potential field defined on a bounded domain of @xmath0 .",
    "we present a complete description of the metastable behavior of this model , as it has been done in the reversible setting in @xcite , following the works of @xcite .",

    "this is done in the general case in which several wells may have the same depth .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a historical review on the derivation of the eyring - kramers formula .    since the works of bovier , eckhoff , gayrard and klein @xcite , which established the link between potential theory of markov chains and metastability , it is known that one of the major difficulties in the proof of the metastable behavior consists in obtaining sharp estimates for the capacity between different sets of wells . in the present non - reversible context , the dirichlet and the thomson principles @xcite provide double variational formulas for the capacity in terms of flows and functions .",
    "these results also identify the optimal flows and functions which solve the variational problem .",
    "in particular , the computation of the capacity is reduced to the determination of good approximations of the equilibrium potentials between wells and of the associated flows .",
    "it turns outs that for random walks in potential fields @xcite , the equilibrium potential drastically changes from @xmath1 to @xmath2 in a mesoscopic neighborhood around saddle points between local minima , and that all the analysis is reduced to a detailed examination of the dynamics around the saddles points .    to our knowledge",
