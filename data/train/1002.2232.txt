    "since 1997 , the measurements of the redshift of a significant fraction of events ( more than 200 nowadays ) is giving us the possibility of performing systematic investigations of the intrinsic properties of gamma ",
    "ray bursts ( grbs ) . among these ,",
    "the correlation between the photon energy , , at which the spectrum ( in the cosmological rest  frame of the source ) of the prompt emission peaks , and the isotropic  equivalent radiated energy , , is one of the more intriguing and debated @xcite . indeed ,",
    "several observational and thoretical studies have shown the relevance of the existence and properties ( namely , the slope and the dispersion ) of the correlation for the models of the grb prompt emission , whose physics and geometry are still to be settled @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was found that short grbs do not follow the correlation , as is true for the peculiarly sub  energetic and close grb980425 , the proto  type of the grb / sn connection ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "these evidences suggest that the plane can be used to distinguish between different classes of grbs and to understand the differences in the physics / geometry of their emission @xcite .",
    "the correlation , together with other `` spectral  energy '' correlation derived from it by adding more observables or substituting with the average peak luminosity , were also investigated as a promising tool for the estimate of cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "thus , the enrichment of the sample of events with known redshift and , together with the investigation of the impact of selection and instrumental effects on the correlation , is of key importance for this field of research . under this respect ,",
    "the satellite , thanks to the unprecedently broad energy band ( @xmath08 kev ",
    "@xmath050 mev ) of its grb monitor ( gbm ) is expected to provide a significant contribution .",
    "this is particularly true in the present `` golden era '' , in which the satellite , thanks to its fast and accurate location of the early afterglow emission , is allowing prompt follow  up of grbs with optical telescopes and , consequently , a significant increase of the numbe of redshift estimates .",
    "in addition , the /lat can detect and localize those bright grbs with emission extending up to the gev energy range , thus allowing the investigation of the spectral ",
    "energetic properties of peculiarly energetic events and to further test the robustness and extension to the correlation .",
    "figure  1 shows the location in the plane of those grbs with measured redshift spectral peak energy , as of the end of 2009 .",
    "the sample of long grbs includes 108 events .",
    "for the 95 events up to april 2009 , the data are taken from @xcite and @xcite . for the remaining 13 grbs ( 090516 , 090618 , 090715b , 090812 , 090902b , 090926 , 090926b , 091003 , 091018 , 091020 , 091029 , 091127 , 091208b ) the values of and",
    "were calulated based on the redshift , fluences and spectral parameters reported in the gcns ( _ gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov _ ) and following the method described , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "the values for short grbs are from @xcite .",
    "as can be seen , the and values of all long grbs , with the already mentioned exception of the peculiar grb980425 , are strongly correlated ( spearman s @xmath1 = 0.86 for 108 events )",
    ". the correlation , as reported also in previous works @xcite , can be modeled with a power  law with index @xmath00.5 and an extrinsic dispersion ( i.e. , the scatter of the data in excess to that expected based on poissonian fluctuations only ) @xmath2(log)@xmath00.2 . as discussed above ,",
    "even if the sample is still small , there is clear evidence that short grbs do not follow the correlation holding for long ones .",
    "this fact gives further clues on the different emission mechanisms at work in the two classes of events and makes the plane a useful tool to distinguish between them @xcite .",
    "a natural explanation for the short / long dicotomy and the different locations of these classes of events in the plane is provided by the `` fireshell '' model of grbs @xcite .",
    "the impact of selection and instrumental effects on the correlation of long grbs was investigated since 2005 , mainly based on the large sample of batse grbs without known redshift .",
    "different authors came to different conclusions @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite showed that batse events potentially follow an correlation and that _ the proper question is not if the correlation is real but if , and how much , its measured dispersion is biased_. there were also claims that a significant fraction of grbs is inconsistent with the correlation @xcite .",
    "however , as can be seen in figure  1 , when considering those events with peak energy measured by broad  band instruments like , e.g. , konus  wind or the /gbm ( see next section ) or reported by the bat team in their catalog @xcite or gcns , it is found that they are all consistent with the correlation as determined with previous / other instruments @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite also found that the slope and normalization of the correlation based on the single data sets provided by grb detectors with different sensitivities and energy bands are very similar .",
    "these evidences further support the reliability of the correlation .",
    "as discussed above , in the last five years , thanks to the unprecedented capabilities of the the satellite , the fraction of grbs with redshift estimate increased significatly .",
    "however , due to the limited energy band ( 15150 kev ) of the bat grb monitor , can estimate only for 1520% of the events .",
    "indeed , for most of the grbs that can be placed in the plane ( figure 1 ) , the peak energy could be measured thanks to the simulatenous detection by other detectors with better spectral capabilities ( e.g. , konus ",
    "wind ) . in ths",
    "context , with its wide field of view and unprecedently broad energy band , the /gbm is expected to provide an important contribution by significantly increasing the number and accuracy of the estimates of for grbs with measured redshift .    in figure  2 ,",
    "i show the location in the plane of those grbs for which the spectral parameters were provided by the gbm , with the only exception of grb 090323 ( also detected by the lat ) , for which the spectrum of the whole event was reported only by the konus ",
    "wind team @xcite .",
    "the red dashed line is the best fit power ",
    "law of this sample , whereas the continuous line show the best ",
    "fit power  law and @xmath32@xmath2 dispersion region of the correlation as determined by @xcite based on a sample of 75 grbs not including events .",
    "as can be seen , grbs follow the correlation , with a slope and dispersion well consistent with those determined based on measurements by other satellites .",
    "figure  2 also shows that , as already pointed out and discussed by @xcite , the extremely energetic events with gev emission detected and localized by the lat , grb080916c and grb090323 , are consistent with the correlation and extend it to higher energies .",
    "pushed by the extension of the spectrum of grb080916c up to several gevs without any significant deviation from the band function describing the soft gamma ",
    "rays emission , these authors also investigated the impact of the extension from 10 mev up to 10 gev of the energy band on which is computed , finding no significant changes in the slope and dispersion of the correlation .    finally , provided the most accurate estimate of for a short burst with measured redshift , grb090510 .",
    "the apparent deviation of this event from the correlation is a further confirmation of results obtained by previous satellites .",
    "it has to be cautioned that the spectral parameters and fluences published in the gcns by the gbm team are still preliminary .",
    "however , the results coming from a more refined analysis are not expected to be so different to drastically change the above conclusions .",
