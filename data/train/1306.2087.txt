    "in the prevalent orientation - based unified scheme ( ous ) , fr  ii - type radio galaxies ( rgs ) and radio - loud quasars arise from the same parent population of radio sources , and it is only the orientation with respect to the observer s line of sight that makes a source appear as a quasar or a radio galaxy ( rg ) .",
    "it is thought that there is an optically thick torus of a half cone - opening angle @xmath1 , that surrounds the nuclear continuum and the broad - line optical emission region , and that the axis of the torus coincides with the major radio - axis of the source .",
    "if the orientation of the source in the sky happens to be such that the observer s line of sight lies within the opening angle of the torus , then the observer is able to see the inner continuum and the broad - line region , and the source gets classified as a quasar .",
    "however if the observer s line of sight cuts through the obscuring toroidal region , then the observer can not see the inner broad - line region , and the source gets classified as an rg .",
    "thus it is the orientation of the source in the sky that decides whether it will appear as an rg or a quasar , the latter when the major radio - axis happens to be within a certain critical angle ( @xmath1 ) around the observer s line of sight .",
    "rgs and quasars , in all other respects , are considered to be intrinsically the same . in this scenario , due to the foreshortening arising because of the sharper inclinations of their radio axes with respect to the observer s line of sight , the observed radio sizes of quasars should appear systematically smaller than those of rgs .",
    "ous has become quite popular because of its simplicity and the promise it holds to bring two apparently quite distinct class of objects , viz .",
    "quasars and rgs , under one roof . according to this scheme , it is the value of @xmath2 that determines the relative numbers and sizes of quasars and rgs in a low - frequency radio - complete sample .",
    "barthel ( 1989 ) pointed out that in the 3crr sample , in the redshift range @xmath3 , the observed number as well as sizes of quasars are typically about half as large as those of rgs .",
    "the corresponding value of @xmath4 has gained credence in the literature and is presently thought to be a ` canonical ' value for division between rgs and quasars .",
    "however data in other redshift bins from the rest of the 3crr sample do not seem to fit into this simple scenario as the relative number of rgs there far exceeds than that expected within the unified scheme ( singal 1993a ) .",
    "it was later pointed out ( laing et al .",
    "1994 ) that at low redshifts , fr  ii - type radio galaxies contain a significant number of low - excitation galaxies ( legs ) ( see e.g. hine & longair 1979 ) , which are unlikely to appear as quasars when seen end - on and should be excluded from the sample while testing the unified scheme models .",
    "evidence for a population of powerful radio galaxies , concentrated at low redshifts , which lack the hidden quasar comes also from infra - red observations ( ogle et al . 2006 ; leipski et al . 2010 ) .",
    "hardcastle et al . (",
    "2009 ) from both x - ray and mid - ir data , showed that almost all objects classed as legs in optical spectroscopic studies lack a radiatively efficient active nucleus . independently , from the observed opposite behavior of the luminosity  size correlations among rgs and quasars as well as the vast differences in their cosmological size evolutions , singal ( 1988 , 1993b , 1996 ) concluded that rgs and quasars could not be arising from the same parent population and therefore they do not fit in ous type of models .    in samples selected at meter wavelengths , the flat - spectrum core - emission ,",
    "if any , is highly suppressed with the relativistic beaming effects playing almost no part and the emission only from the steep spectrum extended parts of the source is observed .",
    "therefore a comparison of the observed size of rgs and quasars is a very robust test , as at meter wavelengths both quasars and rgs are picked by the strength of only their extended radio emission , unaffected by any orientation effects . since both rgs and quasars are supposed to arise from the same parent sample , there relative distributions should not depend upon on redshift or luminosity , and their observed size ratios should show the geometrical projection effects .",
    "the initial proposal for ous was that all steep spectrum ( @xmath5 ) frii radio galaxies ( rgs ) and quasars belong to the same parent population , barring of course a small number of compact steep spectrum sources ( csss , with size @xmath6 kpc ) , which represent an altogether a different population of radio sources ( barthel 1989 ) . according to this scheme every one of these rgs harbors a hidden quasar , which becomes apparent only when the major radio - axis of the source happens to be oriented within a certain critical angle ( @xmath1 ) around the observer s line of sight .",
    "however , with the stipulation that legs do not contain a hidden quasar , the conventional wisdom is that hegs alone partake in unification with quasars and then it is expected that in this modified unification scheme , due to geometry , the observed numbers and sizes of quasars are expected to be smaller as compared to hegs by factors based on the @xmath1 value . such an investigation for comparison of hegs and quasars numbers and sizes has not been done until now .",
    "here we attempt to verify whether the data in the updated 3crr sample are indeed consistent with ous , when the population of legs is excluded .",
    "this is in particular important because recently in an about five times deeper mrc sample ( kapahi et al .",
    "1998a , b ) an expected difference in radio sizes of quasar and rgs was not seen ( singal & singh 2013a ) in any of the redshift bins , casting serious doubts on the unified scheme models .",
    "a similar inconsistency with ous has been pointed out in a strong - source sample selected from the equatorial region of sky ( singal & singh 2013b ) , whose selection criteria are very similar to that of the 3crr , and which presently is perhaps the best sample to match the 3crr sample ( best et al .",
    "the pertinent question that needs an examination is  after excluding legs ,",
    "do we find the data in the 3crr case consistent with ous which was not seen in other independent sample ?",
    "we critically scrutinize the 3crr case in order to check its consistency with ous .",
    "our chosen 3crr sample ( laing et al . 1983 ) is radio complete in the sense that all radio sources stronger than its sensitivity limit @xmath7 jy are included ( and certainly with no spurious entries as each and every source in the sample has been studied in detail ) .",
    "the sample covers the sky north of declination , @xmath8 , except for a zone of avoidance , a band of @xmath9 about the galactic plane .",
    "also it has a 100% optical identification content with detailed optical spectra to classify radio sources into radio galaxies and quasars .",
    "much more detailed optical information has now become available for the 3crr sample since papers by barthel ( 1989 ) and singal ( 1993a ) , with new data mostly on the recognition of low - excitation and high - excitation galaxies .",
    "following jackson & rawlings ( 1997 ) , legs are defined as objects having ( rest - frame ) [ o iii ] equivalent widths @xmath10  , [ o ii]/[o iii ] ratios @xmath11 , or both .",
    "also there are many more broad - line radio galaxies ( blrgs ) or weak quasars ( wqs ) , the latter with compact optical nuclei detected in infrared or x - rays in erstwhile classified narrow - line rgs ( see grimes et al .",
    "we have taken the updated optical and radio data from _ https://www.astrosci.ca / users / willottc/3crr/3crr.html_.    the 3crr sample includes 8 sources ( 5 quasars and 3 rgs ) with radio spectral index @xmath12 ( with @xmath13 ) ; we have excluded these flat - spectrum cases , since these mostly are core - dominant cases where the relativistic beaming might introduce serious selection effects . only the strong frii rgs (",
    "fanaroff & riley 1974 ) with luminosity above a certain critical value are supposed to partake in unification with quasars .",
    "this critical luminosity value translates to @xmath14 w hz@xmath15 for more recent cosmological parameters @xmath16 km  s@xmath15mpc@xmath15 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) , and we have confined ourselves to sources only more luminous than that . it should be noted that the steep spectrum quasars and frii rgs almost always have edge - brightened radio morphologies , which makes it possible to define size of the radio source between its extremities , independent of the sensitivity of the observing telescope .",
    "there are 17 fris below this luminosity limit , which we have excluded ; the quasars all except one fall above this luminosity limit . also excluded are six fri s ( a1552 , 3c288 , 3c310 , 3c314.1 , 3c315 , 3c346 ) , which lie above this luminosity limit , but have the fri radio morphology . included among quasars",
    "there are 14 broad - line radio galaxies or weak quasars , all classified under wqs .",
    "also there are seven compact steep spectrum sources ( csss ; linear size @xmath19 kpc ) , comprising 2 hegs and 5 quasars , which seem to be a different class than the frii class of sources whose unification is sought in ous , and have therefore been excluded .",
    "our final sample then contains 130 sources , with 85 rgs and 45 quasars . among these 85 rgs",
    "there are 17 legs , leaving 68 hegs .",
    "our sample differs from barthel s ( 1989 ) sample ( in the redshift range @xmath3 ) in that there are 3 wqs ( 3c22 , 3c41 , 3c325 ) which we have deleted from list of rgs and counted them among quasars .",
    "also 3c345 has been excluded as it is a flat spectrum quasar ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "thus we have 14 quasars instead of 12 as in barthel s sample . among rgs ,",
    "4c74.16 has been included as it fits the selection criteria , on the other hand 3c272 has been excluded as it does not meet the selection criteria of 3crr sample ( it flux - density falling below the sample criteria ) . further as mentioned in singal ( 1993a ) ,",
    "the cases like that of 3c226 , 3c234 and 3c265 , where the broad lines are seen in the polarized ( reflected ! ) emission only ( grimes et al . 2004 ) , need to be counted among the narrow - line radio galaxy population , insofar as the testing of the unified scheme is concerned , since the obscuring torus surrounds their optical cores and their radio axes are still assumed to be in the sky - plane . in that sense",
    "even if it turns out later that some more galaxies in our sample show broad lines in the polarized emission , they should not affect our results .",
    "thus there are 27 rgs ( instead of 30 in barthel s sample ) out of which 26 are hegs and one ( 3c427.1 ) leg .",
    "also note that las for 3c216 and 3c380 we have used are 3 and 7 arcsec respectively , the same as the values used by barthel .",
    "there are a total of 130 sources in our sample listed in table 1 , which presents iau and 3crr source name , flux - density @xmath21 at 408 mhz , the spectral index @xmath22 ( @xmath13 ) , nature of optical object ( heg : high - excitation radio galaxy ; leg : low - excitation radio galaxy ; q : quasar ) , redshift @xmath23 , largest angular size @xmath24 ( in arcsec ) , linear size @xmath25 in kilo - pc and luminosity @xmath26 in w / hz . the details of the formulation for calculating linear size and luminosity are described in singal & singh ( 2013a ) .",
    "figure 1(a ) shows a histogram of the redshift ( @xmath23 ) distributions of the low - excitation galaxies ( legs ) and high - excitation galaxies ( hegs ) , while figure 1(b ) shows that of quasars .",
    "the number of objects in each category are listed in either panel .",
    "the first thing that we note from the figure 1(a ) is that legs are indeed found only at low redshifts ( with all 17 lying at @xmath27 ) .",
    "another thing that is apparent is that the quasar population at low redshifts ( figure 1(b ) ) comprises predominantly wqs .",
    "figure 2(a ) shows legs are also of relatively low luminosities as compared to hegs , the latter peaking at a much higher luminosity value .",
    "figure 2(b ) shows the luminosity distribution of quasars , including wqs . after excluding legs",
    ", the luminosity distribution of hegs is quite similar to that of quasars ( with wqs of course classified with quasars ) .",
    "figure 3 shows normalized cumulative size distributions of rgs and quasars in various redshift bins . in the lowest redshift bin ( @xmath0 )",
    "there are 43 rgs and 13 quasars , the latter including 9 blrgs ( or wqs ) .",
    "rgs are divided into 16 legs and 27 hegs , and are accordingly separately plotted in figure 3(a ) . in barthel s ous model",
    "the number ratio of hegs and quasars is expected to be close to two , and with the exclusion of legs from rgs ( and of course inclusion of blrgs or wqs along with quasars ) we do get number ratios reasonably consistent with ous , with quasar fraction @xmath28 . at the same time a solution to the anomaly in the size distribution in the 3crr sample in this redshift range ( @xmath29 ) is also sought by this exclusion of large number of legs , with relatively smaller radio sizes , to offset the large sizes of hegs . in a picture consistent with barthel s model , a quasar fraction ( @xmath30 ) in this bin implies the sizes of quasar should be statistically smaller than those of the hegs by a factor of about two .",
    "however , we do not find hegs sizes to be larger than of quasar ( figure 3(a ) ) .",
    "while it is true that legs do have systematically smaller size than hegs , however their exclusion is still not sufficient to leave hegs with median size value double than that of quasars as one would have expected in ous , in consistency with their observed numbers .",
    "table 2 shows a comparison of the observed ratio of the median size values with the expected ratio from the unified - scheme model , calculated from the observed numbers of hegs and quasars in different redshift bins .",
    "table 2 presents the sub - sample used , number of quasars in that redshift bin , number of hegs in that redshift bin , fraction of quasars in that redshift bin , median value ( kpc ) of size distribution for quasars , median value ( kpc ) of size distribution for hegs , critical angle @xmath31 ( degrees ) calculated from the observed number ratio of hegs and quasars , expected size ratio @xmath32 of hegs and quasars calculated from @xmath31 and the actually observed size ratio @xmath33 .",
    "it should be noted that the median values are not very sensitive to errors in individual size measurements . the rms error in @xmath34 in each case",
    "is determined from the frequency distribution ( histogram ) of size distribution .",
    "the rms error is given by @xmath35 in units of the class interval of @xmath25 ( kendall 1945 ; yule & kendall 1950 ) , where @xmath36 is the total number of sources in that redshift bin and @xmath37 is the ordinate value of the smoothed frequency distribution at the median value in the respective histogram .    from figure 3(a ) and table 2 we see that quasars , if anything , appear to have sizes somewhat larger than of the hegs in this lowest redshift bin ( @xmath0 ) ; certainly they are not a factor of 1.7 smaller than the hegs as would be expected from foreshortening due to geometric projection consistent with their number ratios .",
    "in fact from table 2 we notice that the observed size ratio differs from that predicted by ous from observed quasar fraction at @xmath38 level . in no ous scenario",
    "should quasar sizes be larger than of hegs . even in the limiting case when @xmath31 approaches @xmath39 , the median value of quasar sizes distributed between @xmath40 and @xmath39 will be smaller than of the hegs ( all consequently in the sky plane ) by a factor of @xmath41 .",
    "thus the inconsistency of ous with the 3crr data in the @xmath0 bin , contrary to all expectations , does not get eliminated even when legs are excluded and a major difficulty for ous in the low redshift region ( @xmath0 ) still remains .",
    "thus with its basic tenet , that the observed quasar sizes should always be smaller than of the hegs , having been violated , ous seems to be thus discordant with the low redshift data .    in the intermediate redshift range ( @xmath42 )",
    "the fraction of quasars is @xmath43 , and the quasar sizes also seem smaller than of the hegs ( figure 3(b ) , table 2 ) .",
    "this of course should not come as a surprise since barthel s ( 1989 ) proposal of ous ( with a cone opening angle @xmath44 ) , was based on the data in this very bin only .",
    "but strangely the data at high redshifts ( @xmath45 ) too shows some anomaly , as even if the sizes of quasars are smaller with respect to those of hegs there , in consistency with that the numbers of quasars is not smaller than of the hegs , in fact their number looks to be even larger ( 18 of them instead of 7 or 8 expected from 15 hegs ) .",
    "it does not seem that ous can be still supported from the 3crr data .",
    "this is in addition to that all other samples ( singal & singh 2013a , b ) have also shown incompatibility with ous .",
    "baldi et al .",
    "( 2013 ) have examined the flux ratios of core fraction at 5 ghz with the integrated flux density at 178 mhz , and found it to be qualitatively consistent with ous .",
    "it needs to be realized that core dominance may give only a qualitative discrimination for or against ous , but it can not provide quantitative tests as the core fraction have multivariable dependence , viz .",
    "orientation angle @xmath46 and the lorentz factor @xmath47 .",
    "in addition to the intrinsic spread in the flux density of the core as well as of the extended emission , the uncertainties in spectral index between 178 mhz and 5 ghz could change the estimated flux of the extended component ( or of the integrated emission ) by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "moreover for larger angles @xmath48 , the orientation is not very discriminating as flux of core does not vary steeply with angle .",
    "in fact for larger angles due to relativistic beaming the core flux rather decreases by a factor @xmath47 .",
    "we should clarify that the evidence against the unification of extended rgs and quasars here does not necessarily invalidate the relativistic beaming models ( orr & browne 1982 ) of the unification of core - dominated and lobe - dominated quasars .",
    "in the same way , any evidence seen in favor of the relativistic beaming models can not be cited in favor of unification of extended rgs and quasars .",
    "the two unifications are independent even if these have been combined in the so - called grand unification scheme models of the active galactic nuclei ( urry & padovani 1995 ; peterson 1997 ; kembhavi & narlikar 1999 ) .",
    "it is quite likely that radio - loud quasars do not make a randomly oriented population ; the question here is that do rgs and quasars fit together , as proposed by barthel ( 1989 ) , into one unified scheme model like ous ?    the results of baldi et al .",
    "( 2013 ) for the size tests are inconclusive as they find that the two size distributions do not differ at a @xmath49 level and they do not see the expected projection effects in case of quasars .",
    "we also find that though the number distributions do match with ous after the legs are discarded especially for @xmath0 bin , which otherwise had shown a large excess of rgs with respect to quasars in singal ( 1993a ) , however what we find still disconcerting is that the sizes of quasars mismatch the expected value due to projection at a @xmath38 level .",
    "similar anomalies were seen in even other redshift bins in other samples that we had examined earlier ( singal & singh 2013a , 2013b ) .",
    "considering that in addition to the 3crr , any other independent sample ( mrc , brl ) that we examined earlier also showed absence of projection effects in quasar sizes , it seems that there is something amiss in the present version of the ous .",
    "we might stress here that support for any scheme in terms of consistent data does not prove the theoretical model ( since the data could be consistent with other very different models as well ) , however an evidence against does disprove the current model , at least the part that predicts smaller sizes for quasars . in that sense",
    "the data is discordant with the presently prevalent ous models .",
    "one can not save the situation by invoking a receding - torus - type scheme ( lawrence 1991 ; hill et al .",
    "1996 ) where the critical angle ( @xmath1 ) may be evolving with redshift or luminosity , as no @xmath1 value will simultaneously satisfy both number and size ratios in the low ( @xmath0 ) bin .",
    "thus the predictions of ous are not corroborated by the data in low redshift bins @xmath0 even when legs have been excluded .    except for that particular bin ( @xmath42 ) of the 3crr sample , which incidentally was instrumental in the proposition of the unified scheme with the `` canonical '' value @xmath50 , data in other redshift bins do not seem to yield the expected size ratios .",
    "we have learnt that boroson ( 2011 ; private communication ) has constructed a new sample of high - luminosity extragalactic ( @xmath51 ) radio sources , using sdss and three radio surveys ",
    "wenss , nvss , and first , taking care that the sample is not contaminated by anisotropic radio core emission .",
    "he found that the objects with broad lines ( quasars ) tend to have larger projected sizes than those without broad lines ( rgs ) , and from that he has argued that radio - loud quasars could not be unified with radio galaxies by barthel s ( 1989 ) orientation scheme , in agreement with our results . in a recent paper dipompeo et al .",
    "( 2013 ) re - examined size data in three different samples ( including barthel 1989 , boroson 2011 and singal & singh 2013a ) and come to conclusion that cast solely in terms of viewing angle effects , unification of these objections through orientation fails . even allowing for a realistic intrinsic size distribution of rgs and quasars , dipompeo et al .",
    "( 2013 ) find that the results can not easily be reconciled with the paradigm in which different projected sizes of radio sources result from projection only .",
    "they concluded that there is a significant probability that barthel ( 1989 ) could find his claimed size ratio by chance even if there is no unification by orientation .",
    "we showed that in the 3crr sample , the observed sizes of quasar are not in any way systematically smaller than those of the high - excitation galaxies , even when the low - excitation radio galaxies are excluded , in the low redshift bin ( @xmath0 ) . though an exclusion of the population of low - excitation radio galaxies , with apparently no hidden quasars inside , could reduce the observed excess number of radio galaxies at low redshifts to make it in accordance with ous , however it does not still change the size distribution sufficiently so as to make the sizes of the high - excitation galaxies larger than those of the quasars at these redshifts .",
    "the absence of this foreshortening of the sizes of the quasars as compared to that of the high - excitation galaxies is inconsistent with the unified scheme models .",
    "it looks like that barthel s observation that sizes and numbers of quasars were smaller than of the rgs in @xmath52 bin was perhaps only a statistical fluctuation as a similar thing is not seen in the remainder of the 3crr sample , implying that the 3crr data is not in concordance with ous .",
