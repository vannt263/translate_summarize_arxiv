    "recent years have witnessed the rapid advance of solid state devices that take full advantage of coherent quantum mechanical properties  @xcite .",
    "one particular application of such devices is quantum computation , which has attracted intensive research interest over the past 15 years . to implement these devices in practical applications ,",
    "a central task is to generate a quantum state transfer .",
    "for example , it is often desired to transfer the population between different energy levels or different spatial locations so that quantum information can be circulated and processed on a large scale .",
    "in this paper we consider the design of robust control pulses for coherent electron shuttling in solid state devices with a one - dimensional array of quantum dots or donors .",
    "there are a number of proposals which use the donated electron of group v dopants such as phosphorus in silicon as qubits  @xcite .",
    "such dopants can be inserted using ion implantation  @xcite .",
    "recently developed techniques using a scanning tunneling microscope have further allowed them to be placed with high precision  @xcite . in order to couple donors and",
    "achieve greater scalability of qubit array size , it is desirable to be able to move qubits robustly between distant physical locations  @xcite .",
    "the objective is to transport the electron along a chain of donors so that the encoded quantum information can be communicated between distant qubits .",
    "specifically , at the beginning of this procedure , an electron is localized at one end of the chain . then by applying some appropriate external control fields ,",
    "we seek to shuttle the electron to the other end of the chain . depending on the specific physical implementation",
    ", the control fields can be gate voltage  @xcite or tunable on - site energy  @xcite .",
    "to achieve such electron shuttling , greentree et al .",
    "@xcite have proposed to use a solid state version of the well - known stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) for population transfer in quantum optics  @xcite . in this adaptation to the solid state , which is known as coherent tunneling adiabatic passage ( ctap ) , two gaussian pulses are applied in a _ counter - intuitive _ sequence to realize the population transfer in an adiabatic manner , , starting in an eigenstate of the system hamiltonian and changing the hamiltonian sufficiently slowly so that the system will remain in the corresponding eigenstate during the entire transfer process .",
    "the amplitudes , peak times , and standard deviations of the two ctap pulses have to be carefully tuned .",
    "we have recently shown that adiabaticity is , however , not a requisite condition for achieving high fidelity electron shuttling between spatial locations . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have applied lie - poisson reduction to develop a geometric control approach to remove the adiabatic condition and to accomplish the quantum state transfer with complete fidelity .    in the current paper",
    "we are interested in the design of control pulses for electron shuttling that are robust with respect to relevant experimental parameters . in many experiments",
    "it is inevitable that some physical parameters are not precisely known although we may have confidence that they lie in a certain range .",
    "this makes it particularly important to design control pulses in a robust manner so that the electron shuttling process is insensitive to these parameter uncertainties .",
    "we formulate this here as an optimal control problem on the special unitary lie group .",
    "we then discretize the uncertainty range and obtain a finite collection of state transfer problems , each of which takes a different value of the uncertainty parameter .",
    "the gradients of the aggregate fidelity with respect to these control fields are then derived in an analytic form , which allows for efficient implementations of gradient types of optimization algorithms .",
    "we demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm here by numerical studies with realistic physical parameters relevant to the electron shuttling between phosphorus dopant ions in silicon .",
    "in this section we provide a general mathematical description for electron shuttling in solid state devices , together with the key associated mathematical background .    the underlying physics and potential applications of solid state devices with qubits",
    "have been widely discussed in the physical community .",

    "@xcite . for a complete quantum description of the system under realistic conditions , it is necessary to employ the density operator @xmath0 , which is a hermitian matrix with unit trace .",
    "the diagonal elements of the density operator correspond to the electron populations on each site .",
    "the dynamics of the density operator is determined by the liouville - von neumann equation : @xmath1,\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is a traceless hermitian matrix which is termed the system hamiltonian . to be specific",
    ", we focus here on a triple donor system , but note that the development and solution shown here can be easily extended to devices with more donors . in this case",

    "this problem has been solved by the same authors in  @xcite . in that work we developed an efficient numerical algorithm by using the lie - poisson reduction theorem . however , as noted above , in real experiments , it is often the case that the exact value of @xmath8 can not be determined precisely , e.g. , due to imperfections in engineering implementations .",
    "instead , we may only know that the energy difference @xmath8 lies in a range @xmath21 $ ] , where @xmath22 is the nominal value and @xmath23 is the maximum possible error bound .",
    "these two values are usually available for a specific physical system .    in the rest of this paper",
    ", we will design robust control pulses that can achieve the desired spatial state transfer _ regardless _ of what the true energy difference is in the given interval .",
    "to solve the aforementioned robust state transfer problem , we take a number of sampling points in the uncertainty interval and then form a collection of state transfer problems , each of which has a different energy difference .",
    "we then apply a gradient algorithm to find the optimal solution that solves all these problems simultaneously .    to this end , we take @xmath24 equally spaced points @xmath25 in the uncertainty interval @xmath26 $ ] , that is , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 . for each @xmath30 , we consider a dynamical system with the liouville - von neumann equation @xmath31,\\ ] ] where the hamiltonian @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 we now have a set of @xmath24 dynamical systems , which are all identical except for a different value of @xmath8 in each case .",
