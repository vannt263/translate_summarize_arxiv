    "recent observation of diphoton excess at @xmath0 gev is the only tentative new physics at the lhc so far @xcite .",
    "this observation is reinforced when combined with data of the early @xmath4 tev run with that of events collected at @xmath5 tev , though the significance is not large enough to claim any discovery @xcite .",
    "the diphoton excess cross section is in the range of @xmath6 femtobarns ( fb ) , with a resonance width which can be small ( around a gev ) or large ( around @xmath7 gev ) .",
    "a significant number of papers have proposed a solution by assuming the gauge extensions of the standard model ( sm ) symmetry @xcite which results in the required new particle set that can fit the diphoton excess .",
    "a large number of these papers have a model with tev - scale breaking @xmath8 where the scalar and exotic fermions carry non - trivial charges under the new @xmath8 @xcite . in most of the works",
    "the singlet scalar is produced by two gluons through the vector - like quark triangle loop ( similar to the sm higgs production via the top quark loop ) .",
    "then the singlet scalar decays into two photons ( as well as more dominantly to two gluons ) again via the heavy vector - like fermion loops .",
    "one drawback of this scenario is that the yukawa coupling of q to s , @xmath9 , required is non - perturbative to explain the observed level of cross section , or many copies of such q s need to be introduced . in general , this kind of approach explains why the vector - like fermions are around the tev scale . in this work ,",
    "we propose an alternative production mechanism for this observed diphoton excess which can complement the standard production mode mentioned above or have a significant event rate by itself .",
    "our mechanism is that the singlet scalar producing this diphoton signal comes from the decay of a heavy down - type quark @xmath10 which is a color triplet and an @xmath11 singlet with an electric charge of @xmath12 .",
    "this heavy down - type exotic quark is pair produced dominantly from two gluons via strong interactions .",
    "there are two things which help us in increasing the cross section .",
    "the @xmath13 pair production cross section is much larger than the singlet scalar production via the @xmath10 loop ( unless the yukawa coupling of the scalar is somewhat greater than unity ) .",
    "also , three such @xmath10 and @xmath14 quarks naturally appear in our model based on @xmath1 from three fermion families .",
    "the singlet scalar is also naturally present .",
    "the pattern of symmetry breaking that we shall use gives the singlet scalar mass which is close to the @xmath10-quark mass .",
    "the version of @xmath1 model that we use will be discussed in the next section .",
    "one thing we want to emphasize is that the vector - like quark and singlet scalar , which we are using to explain the diphoton excess , are not postulated in an ad - hoc manner for this purpose , but these particles are already present in the @xmath1 grand unified model .",
    "all we do is to use the appropriate symmetry breaking pattern so that one @xmath8 in addition to the sm gauge symmetry remain unbroken at the tev scale or even higher .",
    "the quantum numbers of all the particles are fixed from the @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "because of the underlying @xmath1 symmetry , in addition to explaining the diphoton excess , we have several predictions . along with the diphoton resonant signal",
    ", we will also have events which have both the diphoton resonance as well as a dijet resonance with similar level of cross sections .",
    "also we shall have events with two dijet resonance at the same mass but with cross section about 100 times the diphoton resonance .",
    "these predictions can be tested as more data accumulates at the upcoming 13 tev lhc runs .    in section",
    "[ sec : model ] below , we discuss our model and the formalism . in section [ sec : analysis ] , we discuss the phenomenology of our model .",
    "this includes the details of how our model can explain the diphoton excess , and the other predictions that can be tested in near future .",
    "section [ sec : summary ] contains our conclusions and discussions .",
    "our effective symmetry at the tev scale is the sm together with an extra @xmath15 .",
    "this extra @xmath15 is a special subgroup of the @xmath1 grand unified theory ( gut ) @xcite .",
    "we use non - supersymmetric @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath1 is special in the sense that it is anomaly free , as well as has chiral fermions .",
    "its fundamental representation reduces under @xmath16 as    @xmath17    the representation * 16 * contains the @xmath18 sm fermions , as well as a right handed neutrino .",
    "it decomposes under @xmath19 as    @xmath20    the * 10 * representation under @xmath19 decomposes as    @xmath21    the * 5 * contains a color triplet and a @xmath22 doublet , whereas @xmath23 contains a color anti - triplet and another @xmath11 doublet , and the @xmath24 is a sm singlet .",
    "the gauge boson is contained in the adjoint @xmath25 representation of @xmath1 .",
    "the particle content of the @xmath26 representation , which contains the sm fermions as well as the extra fermions , are shown in the first two columns of table [ e6charge ] . for three families of fermions ,",
    "we use three such @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath1 gauge symmetry can be broken as follows @xcite , @xmath27 the @xmath28 and @xmath29 charges for the @xmath1 fundamental @xmath30 representation are also given in table [ e6charge ] .",
    "the @xmath15 is one linear combination of the @xmath29 and @xmath28 @xmath31    the other @xmath8 gauge symmetry from the orthogonal linear combination as well as the @xmath19 is broken at a high scale .",
    "this will allow us to have a large doublet - triplet splitting scale , which prevents rapid proton decay if the @xmath1 yukawa relations were enforced .",
    "this will need either two pairs of ( @xmath30 , @xmath32 ) and one pair of ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) dimensional higgs representations , or one pair of ( @xmath30 , @xmath32 ) , @xmath35 , and one pair of ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) dimensional higgs representations ( detailed studies of @xmath1 theories with broken yukawa relations can be found in  @xcite . ) for our model , the unbroken symmetry at the tev scale is @xmath36 .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the higgs potential needed for our purpose giving rise to the extra @xmath8 symmetry breaking is @xmath37 note that without the term @xmath38 , there are two global @xmath8 symmetries for the complex phases of @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "after @xmath39 and @xmath40 obtain the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) , we have two goldstone bosons , and one of them is eaten by the extra @xmath8 gauge boson .",
    "thus , to avoid the extra goldstone boson , we need the term @xmath38 to break one global symmetry",
    ". then we are left with only one global symmetry in the above potential , which is the extra @xmath15 gauge symmetry .",
    "thus , after @xmath39 and @xmath40 acquire the vevs , the @xmath15 gauge symmetry is broken , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 will be mixed via the @xmath41 and @xmath38 terms .",
    "the yukawa couplings in our models are @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "thus , after @xmath39 and @xmath40 obtain vevs or after @xmath15 gauge symmetry breaking , @xmath44 and @xmath45 will become vector - like particles from the @xmath46 and @xmath47 terms , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 will obtain vector - like masses from the @xmath50 and @xmath51 terms . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "after we diagonalize their mass matrices , we obtain the mixings between @xmath54 and @xmath55 , and the mixings between @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the discussion of the higgs potential for electroweak symmetry breaking is similar to the type ii two higgs doublet model , so we will not repeat it here .",
    "after @xmath15 gauge symmetry breaking , we obtain two cp - even higgs fields @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and one cp - odd higgs field @xmath60 by diagonalizing the mass matrices of @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "thus , we can have one , two , or three 750 gev resonances of which the most likely candidate would be the @xmath58 as it will have the strongest coupling to the vector - like fermions . although it looks equally probable to have a mixture of any of the aforementioned fields to be the observed resonance in the diphoton mode , there is also the possibility that one can have additional sources for the observed resonance .",
    "there is a viable region of the parameter space in our model where the pair production of the vector - like fermions , @xmath44 , and their subsequent decays to any of the scalars , @xmath58 , @xmath59 or @xmath60 will give rise to the diphoton and other observable signals .",
    "the phenomenology of the model is discussed in the next section .",
    "we note that the supersymmetric @xmath1 gut has also been used in ref .",
    "@xcite , but our model is non - supersymmetric . and",
    "more importantly _ we address an additional mechanism for producing the diphoton excess and associated signals , and therefore the subsequent predictions are entirely different from theirs_.    we note that the @xmath15 gauge boson couples to all the sm fields in addition to the new matter and scalar fields .",
    "the covariant derivatives for the @xmath22 doublet and the singlet scalars are given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 ; @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the mass square matrix for the neutral gauge boson sector in the @xmath67 basis is then given as @xmath68 where @xmath69 where the @xmath70 represent the vevs of the scalar multiplets .",
    "thus , we can clearly see that the new gauge boson mass is dependent on the vevs of all the scalars , such that one can choose one singlet vev to be much smaller than the other and still have a very heavy @xmath71 that evades the existing limits .",
    "moreover , the mixings between @xmath72 and @xmath73 will be zero at tree level if @xmath74 .",
    "the vevs of the @xmath11 doublet scalars determine the sm gauge boson masses and therefore @xmath75 gev .",
    "the structure for the vevs is given as @xmath76 which leads to the following mass matrix for the down - type quarks and the charged leptons in the @xmath77 basis is given as @xmath78 where @xmath79 .",
    "the @xmath80s and @xmath81s represent the down - type quarks for the left matrix and the leptons for the right matrix .",
    "these mass matrices would be diagonalized by a bi - unitary transformation which would lead to a mixing between the vector - like fermions and the sm fermions .",
    "however , one should note that the mixings between the left - handed fermions and the right - handed fermions will be dictated by a different set of mixing angles .",
    "this would have significant implications in the rest of our analysis and plays a crucial role in the signal we have proposed .",
    "we should also point out a few useful assumptions that we think are relevant for the analysis :    1 .",
    "we have neglected any mixing between the electroweak doublet scalars and singlet scalars .",
    "we also ensure that the new @xmath15 gauge boson does not have a significant mixing with the sm gauge boson @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "the mixings between the left - handed sm fermions and the vector - like fermions are taken to be zero , _",
    "i.e. _ , we assume the zero left - mixing angle ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "this will insure that the vector - like fermions do not decay to the sm gauge bosons and light sm fermions  @xcite , thus allowing the only significant channel that would be the decay to a scalar ( @xmath85 ) and sm fermion .",
    "one can also get a very suppressed partial width ( due to the smallness of the yuakawa couplings courtesy the masses of the sm down - type quarks and leptons ) that decays to a sm higgs and light sm fermion , through the mixings in the right - handed fermion sector .",
    "the diphoton signal in our model can arise from several possibilities of the particle spectrum as well as in two different production channels . note that the most popular option in the literature in explaining the diphoton excess has been through the on - shell production of a 750 gev resonance via gluon fusion which then decays to diphotons .",
    "therefore we must point out that such a possibility clearly exists in our model description .",
    "we shall show that what part of the parameter space is best suited for the aforementioned explanation of the diphoton excess and what sort of masses and couplings are required for the new exotics to satisfy the experimental data . notwithstanding",
    "this possibility , we wish to also highlight a new channel of production that can also give rise to the diphoton excess signal and predict an accompanying dijet resonance at the same mass in the same signal events .",
    "this would be possible through the pair production of vector - like quarks which is heavier but very close in mass to one of the scalars which has mass of 750 gev .",
    "the pair produced exotic quarks then decay to this 750 gev scalar and a very soft jet , which is not detected .",
    "so we get a pair of these 750 gev scalars which then decay to either a gluon pair or a diphoton pair .",
    "we believe that such a possibility , which exists for a range of the vlq mass that nearly degenerates with the resonant scalar mass and yet is searched for by the lhc experiments , should show itself with a closer scrutiny of the events along with the new events being collected .",
    "we now take up these two possible channels and analyze the diphoton signal for different parameter choices of the model .",
    "to calculate the several branching fractions of the new exotic particles and signal cross sections we have used the calchep event generator @xcite .",
    "we have implemented the model in lanhep @xcite to create the model files for calchep .",
    "note that the analysis will vary depending on the number of vector - like fermions we might possibly have at sub - tev masses .",
    "the colored vector - like fermions participate in both the production channels while the non - colored one s help in increasing the diphoton branching fraction of the scalar .",
    "we shall consider three different scenarios :    * only one vector - like quark with mass around a tev while all the remaining vector - like fermions have mass of 1.5 tev .",
    "* one vector - like quark and one vector - like lepton having tev mass while the remaining have mass of about 1.5 tev . *",
    "one vector - like quark and two vector - like degenerate leptons having tev masses while again the rest of them have mass at 1.5 tev .",
    "note that the choice of a fixed scale of 1.5 tev mass for the vector - like fermions is made as it helps in expressing our results in terms of the singlet scalar vev of @xmath39 given by @xmath86 which gives the mass to the vector - like fermions as @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "in addition , it helps us in scanning a range for @xmath86 such that the perturbative limit of the yukawa couplings ( taken as @xmath89 ) is not violated .",
    "therefore , a shift in the choice of the mass of the heaviest vector - like fermion would imply that @xmath86 can be varied over a different range .",
    "this gives us the necessary dynamics to understand how the signal strength gets affected by the choice of the mass of the vector - like fermion .    to study the final states we specify here the parameters that are relevant for the analysis .",
    "the vector - like quarks and leptons are represented as @xmath90 and @xmath91 respectively .",
    "as pointed out earlier , the vevs for @xmath39 and @xmath40 which are given by @xmath86 and @xmath92 respectively play a significant role in giving mass to the @xmath93 gauge boson , which we call @xmath73 .",
    "we take the mass of @xmath73 to be 1.5 tev , and fix the value of @xmath92 to be 10 tev",
    ". such large value of @xmath92 becomes a necessity to avoid a significant mixing in the neutral gauge boson sector .",
    "this also forces very small mixing between the scalars @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "this decoupled particle spectrum is somewhat also preferable as the lhc has not observed any other signal other than the diphoton resonance .",
    "note that the new particles in the spectrum can however play a crucial role in determining additional signals for the model at the lhc , which we leave for future analysis as we focus only on the diphoton signal in this work .",
    "we consider two types of processes that will contribute to the diphoton production cross section .",
    "note that the experiments have observed a resonance at 750 gev in the diphoton channel which is best explained by the direct on - shell production in the @xmath94-channel as shown in fig .  [ fig : feynman1 ] . for simplicity , we will take all types of yukawa couplings @xmath95 to be zero for @xmath96 , where @xmath97 ( see sec .",

    "for all the three cases we have considered for our analysis , we choose only one vlq whose mass is varied while the remaining two have mass of 1.5 tev .",
    "hence for all the three cases the @xmath58 production cross section will be same for a given value of @xmath101 . in fig .",

    "the cross sections are doubled if one takes a qcd @xmath107-factor of @xmath108 as for the sm higgs boson .",
    "in addition , we note that as the lightest vlq mass is increased to 1.4 tev , there does not seem to be a significant fall .",
    "this is because in all production curves , there is some contributions from the two heavy vlq s with mass 1.5 tev .",

    "this also ensures that the mass bounds on the vlq can be significantly relaxed as the dominant decay of the vlq when @xmath118 is @xmath119 while @xmath120 when @xmath117 .",
    "note that the decay to the sm gauge bosons will be allowed once we allow the left - handed sm fermions to mix with the vlq and vll .",
    "the decay of the scalar into two photons is again dependent on the mass and yukawa strengths of the vector - like fermions .",
    "as the number of light vector - like leptons are not severely constrained by experiments and their inclusion helps in improving the @xmath121 branching fraction , we shall consider the results with one or more of such vll contributing to the diphoton decay .",

    "[ fig : sh_aa_production ] corresponds to the case of ( one vlq , one vll ) while the right panel represents ( one vlq , two vll ) whose masses are varied .",
    "the curves also represent a variation of the yukawa coupling which is decreasing from left - to - right and quite clearly , a large value of the coupling is more favorable to generate the correct size of the diphoton signal rate but looks possible even with a vlq as heavy as 1 tev and a single light vll in the spectrum .",
    "note that a reasonable enhancement is possible with appropriate @xmath107-factors for the production of @xmath58 .",
    "the inclusion of an extra light vll in the spectrum of similar mass seems to enhance the diphoton rate by about 16% when the vll s are in the mass range of 400 gev , as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sh_aa_production ] . for the heavier vll s",
    "the difference is hardly noticeable when compared to the case with one light vll .",

    "again , we must point out here that a reasonable enhancement is expected from appropriate qcd @xmath107-factors for the @xmath10-pair produced through strong interactions .",
    "as the production of the vlq pair as well as its decay are not dependent on the choice of @xmath86 or the yukawa strength , the number of light vlq s and light vll s are the major players in determining the event rates here .",
    "however , the important thing to note here is that with a very degenerate vlq and @xmath58 , the contributions to the inclusive diphoton rate is quite significant . in principle ,",

    "[ fig : sh_aa_production].,title=\"fig:\",width=288,height=249 ]    thus , this channel would stand to explain the diphoton excess even when the yukawa couplings are very small and contributions to the diphoton rate via @xmath58 resonant production becomes negligible .",
    "however , a simultaneous observation of a dijet resonance at the same mass ( 750 gev ) would be required to confirm this production mode . notwithstanding",
    "this contribution to the observed diphoton signal , this channel is interesting in its own respect as a confirmatory signal of the low lying spectrum that gives rise to the diphoton resonance , even with the vlq s much heavier .",
    "it also suggests an alternative channel for vlq searches at the lhc which complements the observed diphoton signal .",
    "note that the contribution will go down with increasing @xmath113 as the @xmath10 pair production cross section falls for higher @xmath113 .",
    "however , the increase in the number of light vll s helps in increasing the diphoton branching fraction and signal rate .",
    "as long as only a single @xmath10 pair production channel is concerned , it is quite clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : diphoton_xd ] that a very limited range of parameter space is allowed which satisfies the diphoton cross section to be above 3 fb for the @xmath107-factor equal to 2 .",
    "finally we combine the contributions through both production channels for the inclusive diphoton cross section for the reduced mass range of the vlq between @xmath128 gev and plot the two cases of one vll ( left - panel ) and two vll s ( right - panel ) in fig .",

    "the combination clearly shows that a significant amount of parameter space satisfying the required cross section opens up after taking the contribution from both the channels .",
    "the rates are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diphoton_xd_sh ] from both the channels for different sets of @xmath129 , with the fact that larger values of @xmath86 correspond to smaller values of the yukawa couplings . for @xmath86 value of around 700 gev and above , it is difficult to get enough event rates at the leading order with the assumed values of @xmath113 and @xmath126 and the number of light generations .",
    "however , an addition of another light vll in the range of 500 gev would again push the cross sections up .",
    "thus , it is quite possible to contemplate a wide range of values and combinations that can easily accommodate the diphoton excess in the current framework .",
    "pair production channel and @xmath58 resonant production channel as a function of @xmath113 with different choices of @xmath129 .",
    "the two panels represent the same configurations as in fig.[fig : diphoton_xd].,title=\"fig:\",width=278,height=240 ]    pair production channel and @xmath58 resonant production channel as a function of @xmath113 with different choices of @xmath129 .",
    "the two panels represent the same configurations as in fig.[fig : diphoton_xd].,title=\"fig:\",width=278,height=240 ]",
    "in this work we have considered an @xmath1 motivated extension of the sm where the larger symmetry groups are broken at a very high scale and a residual @xmath8 gauge symmetry is the only remaining symmetry beyond the unbroken sm gauge symmetry .",
    "this additional @xmath8 then gets broken at the tev scale through new scalar sm singlets giving rise to a tev scale particle spectrum with three generations of vector - like quarks and leptons and several neutral scalars .",
    "we proposed one of the singlet dominated scalar to be the observed @xmath0 gev resonance and that the diphoton resonance signal indicated by the recent lhc data might also arise from the pair production of vector - like down - type quarks with mass a little bit heavier than @xmath0 gev scalar .",
    "the vector - like quarks decay into the ordinary light quark and @xmath0 gev sm singlet scalar .",
    "the subsequent decay of the scalar singlet produces this diphoton resonance .",
    "we also showed that there is a wide range of parameter space in the model that could accommodate the diphoton signal , either through the more popular proposals in the literatures where the scalar is produced as an @xmath94-channel resonance through gluon - gluon fusion via vlq loop - mediated processes as well as the new channel mentioned above .",
    "the prediction of such a proposal in the current theoretical framework would imply an accompanying dijet signal at the same mass with similar cross section in the @xmath2 final state in addition to two dijet resonances at the same mass for a @xmath3 final state with the cross sections about 100 times larger .",
    "both the predictions would be verifiable as the luminosity accumulates in the upcoming runs of the lhc .",
    "we also proposed that the new production channel is a new search mode for vector - like quarks and would severely affect the current limits on vector - like quark mass which rely on its decay to sm gauge bosons and quarks .",
    "thus , even if the 750 gev diphoton signal indeed proves to be a fluctuation and does not survive the scrutiny of time and the upcoming high luminosity data at the lhc , the new signal for the vlq , proposed in this work , could provide to be an interesting channel to search for new physics beyond the sm .",
