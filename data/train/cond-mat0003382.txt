    "in hybrid systems of ferromagnetic and normal metals , interesting phenomena can appear due the interplay between charge and spin .",
    "the discovery of the giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) effect in metallic magnetic multilayers,@xcite has motivated a large number of studies on the transport properties of such systems.@xcite the gmr is caused by spin dependent scattering in the system .",
    "most studies concentrated on collinear configurations ( parallel and antiparallel configurations ) .",
    "there are several papers which cover non - collinear magnetizations , both theoretical @xcite and experimental.@xcite    magnetoelectronic multiterminal devices reveal new physics,@xcite but may also lead to novel applications , _ e.g.",
    "_ non - volatile electronics .",
    "johnson and silsbee investigated spin dependent effects in a 3-terminal device.@xcite they found transistor effects that depend on the relative orientation of the magnetization of the ferromagnets .",
    "@xcite more recently , a ferromagnetic single - electron transistor in a three terminal configuration has been realized@xcite and studied theoretically.@xcite in this case the source - drain current also depends on the relative orientation of the magnetizations .",
    "brataas _ et al._@xcite give a unified semiclassical picture for electron and spin transport in such systems .",
    "their formalism is inspired by the circuit theory of the andreev reflection,@xcite and is applicable to systems with non - collinear magnetization directions and an arbitrary number and variety of contacts between the ferromagnetic and the normal metals .",
    "however , the simple circuit theory of ref . only holds when the resistances of the contacts between the ferromagnetic and the normal metals are much higher than the resistance of the normal metal itself , thus fails when the size @xmath2 of the system in the transport direction becomes too large .",
    "moreover , when the size of the system is larger than the spin diffusion length ( @xmath3 ) , the presence of spin - diffusion in the normal metal requires a more complicated description with spatially dependent spin distribution functions .    in the present paper ,",
    "we present a study of the transport properties of simple f - n - f systems ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , taking into account different magnetizations of the ferromagnetic reservoirs and spin - diffusion in the normal metal . at low temperatures",
    ", spin - flip can be due to spin - orbit interactions and scattering by defects or impurities .",
    "exchange scattering by paramagnetic impurities also flips the spin ( see _ e.g. _ appendix a in ref . ) .",
    "the length of the normal metal @xmath2 is assumed to be much larger than the mean - free path @xmath4 , so electronic transport may be described by the diffusion equation . on the other hand",
    ", we allow the spin diffusion length @xmath5 , which is the length scale on which an electron looses its spin in diffusive transport , to be much smaller , of the same order , or much larger than the size of the system @xmath2 . under an applied bias ,",
    "ferromagnetic reservoirs inject a spin - current , causing a non - equilibrium magnetization or `` spin accumulation '' in the normal metal .",
    "we are interested in the different mechanisms that reduce and also rotate this spin accumulation . for non - collinear configurations",
    "the physics of spin injection is more subtle than in the simple collinear case , since it requires generalized boundary conditions for transport through a single ferromagnetic - normal metal ( f - n ) contact.@xcite in general , such a contact is charaterized not only by the conventional spin dependent conductances @xmath6 , which describe the transport of spins collinear to the magnetization of the ferromagnetic reservoir , but also by the @xmath7 _ mixing _ conductance @xmath8 ( see ref . ) , that contains information about the transport of spins oriented perpendicular to the magnetization of the ferromagnetic reservoir .",
    "we are also interested in the effect of a magnetic field applied to the diffusive normal metal in arbitrary directions . in this case",
    "we assume that the magnetic field only couples to the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "our approach is similar to the treatment of a precessing magnetic field applied to a diffusive metal in ref ..    in section ii we introduce and solve the basic equations for the diffusive spin transport , showing the general expression for the non - equilibrium distribution function in the normal metal . in section",
    "iii we discuss the boundary conditions of the problem . in section iv we obtain analytical expressions for the total conductance of the system in collinear configurations and in the absence of applied magnetic field .",
    "we also obtain analytical expressions for the total conductance in the case of non - collinear magnetization directions , zero magnetic field and no spin - flip scattering . in section",
    "v we calculate numerically the conductance in the general case . in section",
    "vi we summarize and discuss our results .",
    "when a bias is applied to our f - n - f device , a spin current is injected from the ferromagnetic reservoirs into the normal metal , causing a non - equilibrium magnetization or spin accumulation . for an arbitrary magnetic configuration of the system ,",
    "the spin accumulated in the normal metal can be oriented in differents directions . if we take the spin quantization axis parallel to the magnetization of one of the ferromagnetic reservoirs , we need to take into account spins oriented perpendicular to this quantization axis , which can be described as a superposition of up ( @xmath9 ) and down ( @xmath10 ) spin states .",
    "we study a geometry invariant to translations in the lateral direction , so all quantities depend only on one spatial coordinate @xmath11 .",
    "the spin - polarized electron distribution is characterized by a @xmath12 matrix in spin space of the form : @xmath13 when the size of the system @xmath2 is larger than the spin diffusion length @xmath14 , @xmath15 depends on the position . here",

    "this non - mononotic behavior of the conductance is specially relevant between parallel and antiparallel configurations , because the difference between the conductance of both configurations @xmath223 can be modulated from positive to negative values by the external magnetic field .    when @xmath214 , according to eq.([buvw ] ) in appendix a , @xmath37 has only one component @xmath224",
    "@xmath225 @xmath226 ( see ref . ) .",

    "@xmath200 is then an antisymmetric matrix , due to the contributions of the terms which includes @xmath242 so for @xmath243 @xmath244 which means asymmetric behavior of the conductance with respect to time reversal . on the other hand ,",

    "does not approach unity asymptotically . in this configuration",
    "there are some injected spins , which are parallel to the magnetic field and which do not precess at all .",
    "so this part of the spin accumulation remains in the system and does not relax irrespective of the values of the magnetic field .",
    "more interesting is the appearence of a dip in the conductance for small values of the magnetic field .",
    "if we repeat the calculation of @xmath169 vs @xmath217 for the same set of parameters except for @xmath247 we see that the dip disappears ( fig .",

    ", we understand that the real part of the mixing conductance describes processes at the contacts in which spins perpendicular to the magnetization direction , are transmitted or reflected obeying time - reversal symmetry . on the other hand ,",
    "the imaginary part of the mixing conductance describes processes in which the spins precess around the magnetization vector of the ferromagnet . as a result of the precession , the orientation of the spin changes .",

    "the existence of spin - flip scattering reduces @xmath14 .",
    "if @xmath249 there is no strong spin - flip scattering in the system and it is possible to observe spin - dependent effects . on the other hand , if @xmath120 , the injected spins relax very fast due to spin - flip processes and no spin - dependent effects can be observed . in particular in fig .",
    "8 we show how the dip of @xmath237{0xb0}}% % beginexpansion { { } ^\\circ}% % endexpansion $ ] configuration from figs . 7a and 7c , is suppressed by spin - flip scattering on the system . also by decreasing @xmath250 @xmath169 increases for constant magnetic field , to the value @xmath251 .",

    "we have shown how the spin - dependent transport through a f - n - f double heterojunction can be described in terms of the spin dependent conductances of the contacts @xmath252 the magnetization direction @xmath253 of the ferromagnetic reservoirs , and the normal metal conductance @xmath254 the dependence of the conductance on the relative angle between the magnetizations of the different ferromagnets is affected by the mixing conductance @xmath0 . for non - collinear transport between the ferromagnetic reservoirs , @xmath87 describes transport of spins perpendicular to the magnetization direction of the ferromagnets .",
