    "in this paper , we initiate an investigation of hitting time theorems for random matrix processes . hitting time theorems have their origins in the study of random graphs",
    "; we briefly review this history , then proceed to an overview of recent work on discrete and continuous random matrix models and a statement of our results .    to begin , consider the classical _ erds - rnyi graph process _",

    "each edge is independently present with probability @xmath10 , and for @xmath11 we have that @xmath7 is a subgraph of @xmath12 .",
    "bollobs and frieze @xcite proved the following _ hitting time theorem _ for @xmath7 , which is closely related to the main result of the present work .",
    "let @xmath13 be the first time @xmath10 that @xmath7 has minimum degree one , and let @xmath14 be the first time @xmath10 that @xmath7 contains a perfect matching ( or let @xmath15 if @xmath0 is odd ) .",
    "then as @xmath1 along even numbers , we have @xmath16 in other words , the first moment that the trivial obstacle to perfect matchings ( isolated vertices ) disappears , with high probability a perfect matching appears .",
    "ajtai , komls and szemerdi @xcite had slightly earlier shown a hitting time theorem for hamiltonicity ; the first time @xmath7 has minimum degree two , with high probability @xmath7 is hamiltonian .",
    "in fact , @xcite generalizes this , showing that if @xmath17 is the first time @xmath7 has minimum degree @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the first time @xmath7 contains @xmath20 disjoint hamilton cycles , then with high probability @xmath21 . hitting time theorems have since been proved for a wide variety of other models and properties , including : connectivity @xcite , @xmath20-edge - connectivity @xcite and @xmath20-vertex - connectivity @xcite in random graphs and in maker - breaker games ; connectivity in geometric graphs @xcite ; and hamiltonicity in geometric graphs and in the @xmath22-dimensional gilbert model  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we introduce the study of hitting time theorems for random discrete matrices .",
    "the study of random matrices is burgeoning , with major advances in our understanding over the last three to five years .",
    "thanks to work by a host of researchers , the behaviour of the determinant @xcite , a wide range of spectral properties @xcite , invertibility @xcite , condition numbers @xcite , and singular values @xcite are now well ( though not perfectly ) understood .",
    "( this list of references is representative , rather than exhaustive . )",
    "the recent paper @xcite provides a nice collection of open problems , with a focus on random discrete matrices .    in order to have a concept of hitting time theorems for matrices , we need to consider matrix _ processes _ , and we focus on two such processes .",
    "the first is the _ bernoulli _ process @xmath23 , defined as follows . independently for each ordered pair @xmath24 , let @xmath4 be a uniform@xmath5 $ ] random variable .",
    "then let @xmath25 be an @xmath0-by-@xmath0 matrix with @xmath26 entry @xmath27 equal to one if @xmath28 and zero otherwise .",
    "for @xmath29 and @xmath30 we let @xmath31 be the directed graph with adjacency matrix @xmath25 , so @xmath32 is a _ directed erds",
    " rnyi graph process_. ( we take @xmath25 to have zero diagonal entries as it is technically convenient for @xmath31 to have no loop edges ; however , all our results for this model would still hold if the diagonal entries were generated by independent uniform random variables @xmath33 , and with essentially identical proofs . )",
    "the second model we consider is the _ symmetric _ bernoulli process @xmath34 : with @xmath4 as above , for @xmath35 let @xmath36}}$ ] , and set all diagonal entries equal to zero . throughout the paper , we work in a space",
    "in which @xmath37 is the adjacency matrix of @xmath7 for each @xmath38 .",
    "the principal result of this paper is to prove hitting time theorems for invertibility ( or full rank ) for both the bernoulli matrix process and the symmetric bernoulli process ; we now proceed to state our new contributions in detail .",
    "given a real - valued matrix @xmath39 , write @xmath40 define @xmath41 similarly , and let @xmath42 .",
    "given a collection of matrices @xmath43 , let @xmath44 , with the convention that @xmath45 .",
    "we write @xmath46 when the matrix process under consideration is clear .",
    "we say that a square matrix @xmath39 is singular if @xmath47 , and otherwise say that @xmath39 is non - singular .",
    "our main result is the following .",
    "[ thm : main]as @xmath1 we have @xmath48    in proving theorem  [ thm : main ] , we also obtain the following new result , which states that for a wide range of probabilities @xmath10 , with high probability there are no non - trivial linear dependencies in the random matrix @xmath25 .",
    "[ thm : digraph ] for any fixed @xmath49 , uniformly over @xmath50 , we have @xmath51    the analogue of theorem  [ thm : digraph ] for the symmetric process @xmath52 was established by costello and vu @xcite , and our analysis builds on theirs as well as that of @xcite . the requirement that @xmath49 in theorem  [ thm : digraph ]",
    "is necessary , since for @xmath53 with @xmath54 , with probability @xmath55 the matrix @xmath25 will contain two identical rows each with a single non - zero entry , as well as two identical columns each with a single non - zero entry ; in this case @xmath56 .",
    "our analyses of the processes @xmath57 and @xmath52 are similar , but each presents its own difficulties . in the former ,",
    "lack of symmetry yields a larger number of potential `` problematic configurations '' to control ; in the latter , symmetry reduces independence between the matrix entries .",
    "where possible , we treat the two processes in a unified manner , but on occasion different proofs are required for the two models .",
    "there are two main challenges in proving theorem  [ thm : main ] .",
    "first , there are existing bounds of the form of theorem  [ thm : digraph ] for the symmetric bernoulli process @xcite . however , in both models , @xmath58 is of order @xmath59 .",
    "this is rather diffuse ; it means that the moment when the last zero row / column disappears is spread over a region in which @xmath60 ones appear in the matrix ( @xmath60 new edges appear in the associated graph ) . as such ,",
    "a straightforward argument from theorem  [ thm : digraph ] or its symmetric analogue , using a union bound , is impossible .",
    "this is not purely a weakness of our methods . indeed ,",
    "if the matrix contains two identical _ non - zero _ rows then it is singular , and the probability there are two such rows ( each containing a single non - zero entry , say ) when @xmath61 is @xmath62 .",
    "this is already too large for a naive union bound to succeed .",
    "moreover , with current techniques there seems no hope of replacing our bound by one that is even , say , @xmath63 for any positive @xmath64 , so another type of argument is needed .",
    "the second challenge is that invertibility is not an increasing property ( adding ones to a zero - one matrix can destroy invertibility ) .",
    "all existing proofs of hitting time theorems for graphs ( of which we are aware ) use monotonicity , usually in the following way .",
    "an _ increasing graph property _ is a collection @xmath65 of graphs , closed under graph isomorphism , and such that if @xmath66 and @xmath67 is a subgraph of @xmath68 , then @xmath69 .",
    "suppose that @xmath70 and @xmath71 are increasing graph properties with @xmath72 .",
    "if there is a function @xmath73 such that uniformly in @xmath74 , @xmath75 then with probability @xmath55 , the first hitting times of @xmath70 and of @xmath71 coincide .",
    "this follows easily from the fact that @xmath70 and @xmath71 are increasing .",
    "however , it breaks down for non - increasing properties and there is no obvious replacement .    to get around these two issues ,",
    "we introduce a method for _ decoupling _ the event of having full rank from the precise time the last zero row or column disappears .",
    "this method is most easily explained in graph terminology .",
    "we take a subset of the vertices of the graph under consideration , and replace their ( random ) out- and/or in - neighbourhoods with deterministic sets of neighbours .",
    "we prove results about the modified model , and then show that by a suitable averaging out , we can recover results about the original , fully random model .",
    "we believe the results about the partially deterministic models are independently interesting , and we now state them .    [ dfn : template ] given @xmath76 , a _ template _ ( or _ @xmath0-template _ ) is an ordered pair @xmath77 , where    1 .",
    "@xmath78 are subsets of @xmath8 $ ] , 2 .",
    "@xmath79 and @xmath80 are sequences of non - empty , pairwise disjoint subsets of @xmath8 $ ] , 3 .",
    "@xmath81\\setminus i^-$ ] and @xmath82\\setminus i^+$ ] .",
    "the _ size _ of @xmath83 is @xmath84 .",
    "we write @xmath85 . also , we say @xmath83 is _ symmetric _ if @xmath86 . finally , for @xmath87 , we let @xmath88 be the collection of @xmath0-templates of size at most @xmath89 .",
    "we remark there is a unique template @xmath83 of size zero , which satisfies @xmath90 ; we call this template _ degenerate_.    given @xmath76 , an undirected or directed graph @xmath67 on @xmath0 vertices and a template @xmath83 as defined above , let @xmath91 be the graph obtained from @xmath67 by letting each @xmath92 have out - neighbours @xmath93 ( and no others ) and each @xmath94 in - neighbours @xmath95 ( and no others ) .",
    "note that if @xmath67 is undirected and @xmath83 is symmetric , then @xmath96 is again undirected , provided we view a pair @xmath97 of directed edges as a single undirected edge .",
    "we write @xmath98 and @xmath99 for the adjacency matrix of @xmath100 and @xmath101 . in @xmath98 and @xmath99 , for @xmath92 ( resp .",
    "@xmath102 ) , the non - zero entries of row @xmath103 are precisely those with indices in @xmath104 ( resp . in @xmath105 ) .",
    "[ thm : gnpl ] fix @xmath106 and @xmath49 . for any @xmath50 and any template @xmath107 , @xmath108 if , additionally , @xmath83 is symmetric then @xmath109    we briefly remark on the assertions of the latter theorem .",
    "first , the first probability bound immediately implies theorem  [ thm : digraph ] , by taking @xmath110 and @xmath111 to be empty .",
    "next , the condition of pairwise disjointness is necessary . to see this , note that if vertices @xmath112 have degree one and have a common neighbour @xmath113 then the rows of the adjacency matrix corresponding to @xmath114 and @xmath113 are identical , creating a non - degenerate linear relation .",
    "finally , in proving the theorem we in fact only require that if @xmath115 , then @xmath116 ( and similiarly for the maximum size of @xmath117 ) .",
    "as we do not believe this condition is optimal we have opted for a more easily stated theorem .",
    "however , it would be interesting to know how far the boundedness condition could be weakened .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm : gnpl ] is based on an analysis of an iterative exposure of minors ; the first use of such a procedure to study the rank of random matrices was due to komls @xcite . in brief",
    ", we first show that for suitably chosen @xmath118 , a fixed @xmath119-by-@xmath119 minor of @xmath25 is likely to have nearly full rank .",
    "adding the missing rows and columns one - at - a - time , we then show that any remaining dependencies are likely to be `` resolved '' , i.e. eliminated , by the added rows .",
    "our argument is similar to that appearing in @xcite for the study of @xmath37 , but there are added complications due to the fact that our matrices are partially deterministic on the one hand , and asymmetric on the other .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm : gnpl ] occupies a substantial part of the paper ; a somewhat more detailed sketch appears in section  [ sec : iterative ] .",
    "vershynin @xcite has very recently strengthened the bounds of costello , tao and vu @xcite , showing that for a broad range of dense symmetric random matrices , the singularity probability decays at least as quickly as @xmath120 , for some ( model - dependent ) @xmath121 .",
    "it seems plausible ( though not certain ) that vershynin s techniques could be transferred to the current , sparse setting , to yield bounds of the form @xmath122 in theorems  [ thm : digraph ] and  [ thm : gnpl ] .",
    "however , we believe , and the results of @xcite suggest , that aside from zero - rows , the most likely cause of singularity is two identical rows , each containing a single one . if the latter is correct then it should in fact be possible to obtain bounds of the form @xmath123 ( for @xmath49 as above ) ; as alluded to earlier , for the moment such bounds seem out of reach .",
    "before proceeding with details , we briefly pause to introduce some terminology . given an @xmath124 matrix @xmath125 ,",
    "the _ deficiency _ of @xmath39 is the quantity @xmath126    also , for any @xmath127 $ ] we denote by @xmath128 the matrix obtained by removing the @xmath103-th row of @xmath39 and the @xmath129-th column ; we refer to @xmath128 as the _ @xmath130 minor _ of @xmath39 .",
    "more generally , given @xmath131 $ ] we write @xmath132 for the matrix obtained from @xmath39 by removing the rows indexed by @xmath133 and the columns indexed by @xmath134 .",
    "also , for @xmath135 we write @xmath136=(m_{ij})_{1\\le i , j\\le k}$ ] .    for a graph @xmath137 and @xmath138 , we write @xmath139 for the set of out - neighbours of @xmath140 in @xmath67 and @xmath141 for the set of in - neighbours of @xmath140 in @xmath67 .",
    "( if @xmath67 is undirected then we write @xmath142 for the set of neighbours of @xmath67 . ) if @xmath39 is the adjacency matrix of @xmath67 then for @xmath143 we write @xmath144 , and similarly for @xmath145 ( and @xmath146 if @xmath39 is symmetric ) .",
    "note that in this case , @xmath147 and @xmath41 correspond to the sets @xmath148 and @xmath149 , respectively .    given real random variables @xmath150 and @xmath151 we write @xmath152 if for all @xmath153 , @xmath154 , and in this case say that @xmath151 _ stochastically dominates _",
    "finally , we omit floors and ceilings for readability whenever possible .",
    "the structure of the remainder of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : decouple ] we explain how to `` decouple '' the linear dependencies of the matrix process from the time at which the last zero row or zero column disappears .",
    "this decoupling allows us to prove theorem  2.1 assuming that theorem  2.4 holds .    in section  [ sec : iterative ]",
    "we introduce the _ iterative exposure of minors _ , analogous to the vertex exposure martingale for random graphs , which we use to study how @xmath155)$ ] changes as @xmath156 increases .",
    "we then state a key `` coupling '' lemma ( lemma  [ lem : coupling ] ) , which asserts that for some @xmath118 with @xmath157 sufficiently small , the process @xmath158),n '",
    "\\le m \\le n)$ ] is stochastically dominated by a reflected simple random walk with strongly negative drift . postponing the proof of this lemma ,",
    "we then show how theorem  2.4 follows by standard simple hitting probability estimates for simple random walk .    in section  [ sec :",
    "rank ] , we describe `` good '' structural properties , somewhat analogous to graph expansion , that we wish for the matrices @xmath159 $ ] to possess .",
    "the properties we require are tailored to allow us to apply _ linear and quadratic littlewood - offord bounds _ on the concentration of random sums .",
    "proposition  [ prop : key ] , whose proof is postponed , states that these properties hold with high probability throughout the iterative exposure of minors . assuming the properties hold , it is then a straightforward matter to complete the proof of lemma  [ lem : coupling ] .    in section  [ sec : structure ]",
    "we complete the proof of proposition  [ prop : key ] .",
    "this , the most technical part of the proof , is most easily described in the language of random graphs rather than of random matrices .",
    "it is largely based on establishing suitable expansion and intersection properties of the neighbourhoods that hold for all `` small '' sets of vertices and in each of the graphs @xmath159 $ ] considered in the iterative exposure of minors .",
    "finally , appendix a states standard binomial tail bounds that we use in our proofs , and appendix b contains proofs of results that are either basic but technical , or that essentially follow from previous work but do not directly apply in our setting .",
    "in this section we explain how the first assertion of theorem  [ thm : main ] follows from the first assertion of theorem  [ thm : gnpl ] .",
    "a similar argument applies to the second assertion of theorem  [ thm : main ] ; we comment on the necessary adjustments to the argument in section  [ subsec : decoupling_sym ] .",

    "we remark that @xmath169 and @xmath170 are measurable with respect to @xmath165 and @xmath164 , respectively , and that @xmath171 is precisely the event that @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "we write @xmath174 instead of @xmath175 when the dependence on @xmath10 is clear from context .",
    "finally , let @xmath176 then , for any template @xmath177 , let @xmath178 observe that @xmath179 and @xmath180 are measurable with respect to @xmath164 .",
    "furthermore , the entries that are random in @xmath99 are precisely those corresponding to the random variables generated by @xmath165 .",
    "lemma  [ split ] , below , uses this fact in order to express the conditional distribution of @xmath181 given @xmath174 , and @xmath179 , as an integral against a conditional density function .",
