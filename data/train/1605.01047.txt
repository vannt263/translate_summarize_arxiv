    "<S> thin films of superfluid @xmath0he were predicted , based on weak - coupling bcs theory , to have a stable phase which spontaneously breaks translational symmetry in the plane of the film . </S>",
    "<S> this crystalline superfluid , or `` stripe '' phase , develops as a one dimensional periodic array of domain walls separating degenerate b phase domains . </S>",
    "<S> we report calculations of the phases and phase diagram for superfluid @xmath0he in thin films using a strong - coupling ginzburg - landau theory that accurately reproduces the bulk @xmath0he superfluid phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the stability of the stripe phase is diminished relative to the a phase , but the stripe phase is stable in a large range of temperatures , pressures , confinement , and surface conditions . </S>"
