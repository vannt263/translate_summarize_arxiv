    "coherent scattering occurs when photons or neutrinos interact with two or more particles and the amplitudes from the various particles in the target add up .",
    "coherent phenomena have been observed in electromagnetic interactions when photons interact with nuclei or atoms or layers of atoms , as is the case with bragg scattering .",
    "a consequence of coherence is an increase of the cross ",
    "section becoming proportional to the square of the number of particles in the target leading to increased counting rates .",
    "a reaction where coherent scattering has been reported @xcite@xcite is    @xmath1    a basic condition for coherent scattering requires the wavelength of the incident particle or the wavelength of the momentum transferred to the target to be large enough so that the entire region within the wavelength contributes to the amplitude .",
    "this situation is difficult to realize in neutrino reactions because the radius of the nucleus sets the scale @xmath2 and it is fulfilled either at very low neutrino energy where the cross sections are small or low momentum transfers @xmath3 0.10 gev@xmath4 where the phase space is limited . in the latter case",
    "it is also necessary to define the particles and the method for controlling the momentum transfer , so that we know that the events originate from coherent scattering .",
    "several cases of coherent neutrino scattering have been discussed in articles @xcite-@xcite but only the reaction in eq .",
    "( [ reaction ] ) has been observed experimentally .",
    "the main reason is that the cross ",
    "sections are very small .",
    "a first case of coherent scattering occurs when the momentum transfer between the incident neutrino and the scattered lepton is small .",
    "this corresponds to the parallel configuration of the leptons . at @xmath5 ,",
    "the pcac hypothesis allows one to derive the contribution of the axial current to the cross section @xcite , @xcite :    @xmath6    the extension to non - zero @xmath7 is given by other mesons , like @xmath8 or @xmath9 pairs @xcite .",
    "a second case of coherent scattering occurs when the wavelength of the momentum transferred to the target nucleus is large enough .",
    "this is satisfied when the 4momentum transfer squared to the nucleus is small .",
    "we shall denote the momentum transfer by t and for @xmath10 gev@xmath4 a peak has been observed for reaction ( [ reaction ] ) in several experiments , which is interpreted as the coherent scattering from the nucleus . in the zero ",
    "recoil approximation @xmath11 \\hspace*{10mm}-\\left [ \\sum_{\\mu,\\pi } ( e_i - p_i^{\\| } ) \\right]^2- \\left [ \\sum_{\\mu,\\pi}p_i^{\\perp}\\right]^2 \\end{array}\\ ] ] where the right  hand side depends on the transverse and parallel momentum components of the muon and the pion , both of which are detectable in the experiments @xcite .",
    "an additional requirement for coherent scattering demands the wave function of the nucleus to be the same before and after the interaction .",
    "this puts restrictions on the intermediate mesons interacting with the nucleons .",
    "the scattering on the nucleus should not change charge , spin , isospin or other quantum numbers .",
    "since the isospin operator , @xmath12 , has eigenvalues with opposite sign for proton and neutron , the contribution of the isovector intermediate mesons is proportional to difference of number of protons and neutrons and therefore negligible for most nuclei .",
    "consequently , in order for proton and neutron contributions to add up the intermediate mesons must be isoscalars .",
    "diagrams which are allowed are shown in figure 1 .",
    "l +    according to these diagrams intermediate vector boson is replaced with the @xmath13 and the @xmath8 mesons and the pion .",
    "the remaining part of the diagrams is computed as the scattering of hadronic states .",
    "piketty and stodolsky @xcite estimated the production of @xmath14mesons meson  dominance , suggesting that the vector current is replaced by the @xmath13meson and the axial current by @xmath8 and other mesons .",
    "rein and sehgal @xcite developed a model with intermediate mesons , introducing a form factor for the nucleus in order to describe coherence .",
    "the last active group in this field is belkov and kopeliovich @xcite who suggest that a summation over intermediate meson states is more accurate .",
    "these suggestions are appealing but it is still hard to compute them accurately@xcite .",
    "we shall describe a calculation along these lines , which relies on the available data and estimates the coherent cross ",
    "section at lower and higher energies .",
    "the effective lagrangian for the low  energy weak interaction of a charged vector meson is @xcite @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "whenever the @xmath13 is on the mass  shell the lagrangian becomes @xmath18 in these equations @xmath19 is the su(2 ) coupling constant and @xmath20 with @xmath21 the cabibbo angle .",
    "similarly the effective interaction of a charged axial meson on the mass shell is given by @xmath22 the constants @xmath23 and @xmath24 are coupling constants of the respective vector mesons to the @xmath25boson and must be determined by experiments .",
    "the decays of the @xmath0lepton provide this opportunity . combining with the standard model lagrangian",
    "we easily obtain lagrangian of effective interaction of the charged current with the @xmath13 meson : @xmath26 and there is a similar formula for the @xmath8meson .",
    "the width of the process @xmath27 is @xcite @xmath28\\displaystyle\\hspace*{20 mm } \\left(m_{\\tau}^2-m_\\rho^2\\right)^2",
    "\\left(m_{\\tau}^2 + 2m_\\rho^2\\right ) .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] this gives @xmath29 .",
    "since chiral symmetry is broken , relation @xmath30 is modified and analysis of experimental data @xcite gives @xmath31 .",
    "the next coupling refers to the decay @xmath32 with the effective coupling @xmath33 the total width of the @xmath8 is poorly known ( being very wide ) and the branching ratios are not determined .",
    "for that reason values of @xmath34 and @xmath35 were determined in @xcite from theoretical considerations based on extended nambu  jona - lasinio model .",
    "the amplitudes for the various diagrams are written following standard feynman rules .",
    "they also involve the couplings of isoscalar mesons to the nucleus for which the contributions of protons and neutrons add up .",
    "when the momentum transfer to the nucleus is large , the scattering is incoherent . for small momentum transfers",
    "@xmath10 gev@xmath4 the whole nucleus participates and contributes coherently .",
    "this aspect is included phenomenologically by introducing a factor @xmath36 with @xmath37 being determined experimentally .",
    "the experiments distinguish two categories of events : events with and without stubs .",
    "events with stubs are incoherent since the nucleus breaks up  they have no special characteristics . for events without stubs ,",
    "the experiments observed a large peak at @xmath10 gev@xmath4 .",
    "many experiments attempt to determine @xmath37 but they reported a large range of values .",
    "the experimental groups also report @xcite the energy dependence of the coherent pion production shown in fig .  2 .",
    "we use the sum of the diagrams described above to produce the curves presented in fig .  2 and obtained the value @xmath38 gev@xmath39 for a neon nucleus .",
    "we also computed the differential cross section shown in fig .",
    "3 .    at @xmath40",
    "the @xmath13exchange graph vanishes whereas @xmath41exchange graph is finite . with increase of @xmath3",
    "the differential cross section @xmath42 corresponding to the @xmath13-exchange graph grows faster than that corresponding to the @xmath41exchange . thus diagram in fig .",
    "1(a ) substantially contributes to the total cross section .",
    "we wish to note here , that in our calculations we take both longitudinal and transversal polarizations of the gauge bosons into account .    the cross section peaks at low values of @xmath43 and @xmath44 as expected .",
    "the differential cross section falls off with increasing @xmath3 which is a consequence of the nucleus form factor .",
    "the value of @xmath37 is much larger than typical values of diffractive scattering , where @xmath45 gev@xmath39 , which is a strong indication that it reflects the particle density within the nucleus .",
    "the scattering of neutrinos through charged current receives contributions mainly from the @xmath8 and @xmath13 intermediate states .",
    "contribution of diagram in fig .",
    "1(c ) is proportional to the lepton mass and therefore negligible .",
    "the difference between neutrino and antineutrino cross sections is also determined by the interference between the diagrams 1(a ) and 1(b ) and is relatively small .",
    "the integrated cross sections for @xmath46 and @xmath47 coherent scattering are depicted in fig .",
    "4 .    the cross - section per oxygen nucleus at @xmath48 gev is @xmath49 cm@xmath4 and for antineutrinos @xmath51 cm@xmath4 .",
    "the cross ",
    "section for resonance production at the same energy per oxygen nucleus is @xmath52 cm@xmath4 .",
    "thus coherent scattering is @xmath53 of the charged current resonance production .",
    "similar calculations were performed for the scattering of neutral currents on an oxygen target . the cross ",
    "sections are smaller and are shown in fig .",
    "4 . again in the case of neutral currents the coherent production of pions is @xmath54 of resonance production . the two numerical estimates for coherent scattering add a small contribution to the neutrino oscillation data at small values of @xmath3 and agree with the values introduced in the analysis of the data @xcite .",
    "coherent production of pions by neutrinos has been observed in several experiments .",
    "the events have a characteristic @xmath43dependence which suggests the scattering from the entire nucleus .",
    "in addition to the @xmath43dependence coherent scattering must show characteristic dependence    * on the momentum transfer between the leptons , @xmath7 , * an azimuthal dependence + @xmath55 + with @xmath56 functions of momenta etc .",
    "independent of @xmath57 , and * a dependence on the atomic number of the nucleus @xmath58 , which has not been determined yet .",
    "the cross sections at various neutrino energies are correlated ( see figs .  2 and 4 ) and it will be a challenge to observe and determine properties of the effect at lower energies in the new generation of neutrino experiments .",
    "a closely related process is @xcite ",
    "@xcite @xmath59 this is a weak process with the pion being replaced by the emission of a photon and it can be calculated accurately . the cross  section is expected to be very small @xcite  @xcite .    finally , another interesting process is @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the field for an axion .",
    "coherent scattering in this reaction is very important because it significantly enhances the chances for observing axions coming from sun or another extraterrestrial source .",
