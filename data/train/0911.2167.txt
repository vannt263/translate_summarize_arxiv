    "stochastic webs exist in the phase spaces of hamiltonian systems , that is , in the space formed by the coordinates and momenta of a dynamical system evolving in the absence of dissipation .",
    "they consist of a network of very thin thread - like regions within which the dynamics is chaotic , whereas the dynamics remains regular everywhere else .",
    "although the concept seems abstract and mathematical at first sight , stochastic webs are now known to arise in a number of practical contexts , including for example plasma physics @xcite , ultra - cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite and electrons in semiconductor superlattices ( sls ) @xcite ; they have also been considered in connection with celestial mechanics @xcite .",
    "the importance of the chaotic threads is that they can transport matter and energy effectively over long distances @xcite . in this",
    "brief and rather informal review we aim to introduce the general reader to stochastic webs , explaining what they are and discussing their recent developments and applications , taking electron transport in semiconductor sls as our example .",
    "we start ( section [ hamsystems ] ) from the definition of a hamiltonian system , its dimensionality and integrability .",
    "then ( section [ perturbdham ] ) we consider the effect of perturbations of the integrable system , which brings us to the concept of a chaotic ( stochastic ) layer , in particular related to resonances .",
    "the latter allows us to explain in the beginning of section [ stochwebs ] the onset of the arnold stochastic web in multi - dimensional systems .",
    "the main purpose of this section is to discuss the more sophisticated nature of low - dimensional stochastic webs which are , however , still related to the concept of resonance . in section [ modstochwebs ] , we explain the limitations of the transport though the low - dimensional web and suggest a subtle way of overcoming these limitations .",
    "finally , in section [ superlattices ] , we discuss a rather unexpected application of the stochastic web concept to quantum electron transport in nanometer - scale semiconductor sls in the presence of electric and magnetic fields . section [ conclusions ] draws conclusions .",
    "hamiltonian systems play an important role in physics , chemistry , biology and engineering , and form a fundamental class of dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "they are defined by the following dynamical equations :    @xmath0    if the hamiltonian @xmath1 does not depend on time @xmath2 , while depending only on the momenta @xmath3 and coordinates @xmath4 , then it is called @xmath5-dimensional . if it also depends on time @xmath2 , then it has the dimension @xmath6 .",
    "a remarkable property of any hamiltonian system is the equality of its full and partial derivatives with respect to time :    @xmath7    in particular , for time - independent hamiltonians , @xmath8 is conserved along the trajectory .",
    "in general , the equations of motion ( 1 ) may not be integrable in quadratures @xcite , whence the importance of _ integrable _ systems , i.e.  those time - independent hamiltonian systems for which a transformation @xmath9 exists such that @xmath10 @xmath11 are called actions while @xmath12 are called angles .",
    "it follows from ( 3 ) that @xmath13 is conserved : @xmath14 while the angles @xmath12 change with constant speeds ( for a given @xmath13 ) , @xmath15 which are called frequencies .",
    "note that angles @xmath12 are cyclic variables i.e. @xmath16 and @xmath17 are periodic functions of @xmath12 with a period @xmath18 for any @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "thus , eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) correspond to periodic or quasi - periodic motion .",
    "the simplest and most often used example of an integrable system is a one - dimensional one , which will be described in more detail below .",
    "it is natural to pose the question : what is the effect of a weak perturbation on an integrable system ? for the majority of cases ,",
    "the answer is given by the kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) theory @xcite : most of the trajectories are just weakly distorted by a weak perturbation while remaining regular .",
    "let us illustrate this by an example of a one - dimensional system weakly perturbed time - periodically .",
    "in this case , it is convenient to present the trajectory in the stroboscopic _ poincar section _",
    "@xcite , i.e. presenting states of the system @xmath19 only at the discrete sequence of instants @xmath20 where @xmath21 is some initial instant , @xmath22 is the perturbation period and @xmath23 . if the trajectory is just weakly distorted while remaining regular , then , in particular , the unperturbed trajectory and the poincar section of the perturbed one have the same dimension of 1 ( i.e. they are just lines ) , and the same topology , while just slightly deviating from each other ( fig .",
    "[ aba : fig1 ] ) .",
    "there are , however , two kinds of situation for which kam - theory is not valid .",
    "the first of these relates to the _ separatrices _ of the unperturbed systems .",
    "let an integrable system possess a separatrix i.e.  the line ( or surface , or hyper - surface in the general multi - dimensional case ) that separates trajectories of a different topology in the phase space : e.g.  in the example shown in fig.[abc : fig2](a ) , the separatrix separates closed trajectories ( corresponding to oscillations inside the separatrix loops ) from open trajectories ( corresponding to the running coordinate below or above the separatrix loops ) .",
    "if the system is perturbed time - periodically , then the separatrix is replaced by a chaotic trajectory . in poincar section ,",
    "the chaotic trajectory lies within a _",
    "chaotic layer _ ( fig .",
    "[ abc : fig2](b ) ) : the latter has a complicated ( fractal ) structure but its outer boundaries are well defined and the region delineated by these boundaries has the dimension 2 , unlike the dimension 1 of regular trajectories .",
    "thus , even the appearance of the poincar section allows us to distinguish immediately between regular and chaotic trajectories , unless of course the width of the chaotic layer is less than the accuracy provided by the numerical integration of equations of motion .",
    "the theoretical prediction of the width in energy of the chaotic layer has a long and rich history .",
    "its description on a physics level of rigour may be found in the book by zaslavsky @xcite . studies that are more mathematically rigorous have recently been reviewed @xcite .",
    "the maximum width of the layer and other significant features ( high peaks ) of the width as function of the perturbation frequency have recently been described @xcite .",
    "another characteristic situation where the kam - theory is invalid relates to _ resonances _ , i.e.  to areas of the phase space where at least one of the following conditions holds    @xmath24    or    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the frequency of the corresponding time - periodic perturbation while @xmath27 is the number of the fourier harmonic that may exist for the time - periodic perturbation ( e.g.  for a monochromatic perturbation , only @xmath28 is relevant ) .",
    "the rigorous treatment of motion in the resonance range is rather complicated , being related to the poincar - birkhoff theorem and homoclinic and heteroclinic trajectories and tangencies @xcite .",
    "we do not consider it here .",
    "rather , we give a brief interpretation of the resonance - related chaos in physical terms .",
    "for the sake of clarity , consider an ac - driven 1d hamiltonian system whose frequency of eigenoscillation @xmath29 increases monotonically with the energy of eigenoscillation @xmath30 , while the perturbation frequency @xmath26 exceeds the minimum of @xmath31 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ abd : fig3 ] :    @xmath32    then there necessarily exists an energy @xmath33 such that the resonance condition ( 7 ) with @xmath34 holds true : @xmath35    consider motion for energies close to @xmath33 .",
    "let us transform from variables @xmath36 to action - angle variables @xmath37 , so that the hamiltonian becomes    @xmath38    here , the dots @xmath39denote terms that vary with time much faster than the preceding term : they are denoted in the next equality as @xmath40 . thus , allowing for the resonance condition ( 9 ) , we may introduce the slow angle @xmath41 and present the original hamiltonian as a sum of an autonomouspart @xmath42 and the time - dependent ( fast - oscillating ) part @xmath43 .",
    "it is easy to check by direct substitution into the corresponding hamiltonian equations of motion that the dynamics of the variables @xmath44 and @xmath45 is governed by the hamiltonian @xmath46 taking into account that the perturbation is small ( @xmath47 ) and , therefore , that the variation of @xmath44 around the resonance value @xmath48 is also small , we may approximate the function @xmath49 near the resonance value as @xmath50 from ( 10)-(12 ) , we ultimately obtain the approximate auxiliary hamiltonian governing the dynamics of @xmath51 : @xmath52    it represents the sum of a pendulum - like plays the role of a generalized velocity while @xmath45 plays the role of the generalized coordinate .",
    "note that the generalized potential contains the small multiplier @xmath53 , so that the maximal absolute value of the velocity@xmath54 is proportional to @xmath55 and , therefore , is small too . ]",
    "autonomous hamiltonian @xmath56 and a time - periodic ( fast - oscillating ) part @xmath40 that plays the role of a perturbation .",
    "the pendulum - like part @xmath57 possesses a separatrix ( cf .",
    "fig.[abc : fig2](a ) ) while the perturbation - like part @xmath40 tends to destroy the separatrix , replacing it with an exponentially narrow chaotic layer .",
    "thus we have shown that a resonance is necessarily associated with a narrow chaotic layer .",
    "in the example considered above , the chaotic layer associated with the resonance provides only a narrow ( @xmath58 ) variation of energy ( or , equivalently , of action ) .",
    "thus , there is no significant transport in energy .",
    "let us pose a question : _ could there be situations when a perturbation provides for chaotic transport through a large range of energies ?",
    "_ we now describe the three stages of conceptual evolution that led to a positive answer to this question .      first , arnold showed in 1964 @xcite through rather simple topological arguments ( also presented clearly in @xcite ) that , if the system is multi - dimensional ( namely , if @xmath59 ) , and if the so called non - degeneracy condition @xmath60 is fulfilled ( in other words , if the system is sufficiently nonlinear ) , then resonances necessarily intersect with each other , forming an infinite _ web _ in the phase space along which an exponentially slow chaotic diffusion occurs .",
    "secondly , chernikov et al .  published an important series of papers in the late 1980s .",
    "we shall review just three of the more important of them , concentrating on the model of a harmonic oscillator subject to a plane wave , which will be relevant to our discussion of semiconductor sls below .",
    "a good review of a broad range of the early work on low - dimensional stochastic webs may be found in @xcite ; more recent work is reviewed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the main idea of chernikov et al .",
    "is that a stochastic web may arise even in low - dimensional systems ( @xmath61 ) provided that the non - degeneracy condition is lifted , in other words , in this case , if @xmath62 while the perturbation in the equation of motion is resonant and coordinate - dependent .",
    "we now consider the best known example of a low - dimensional stochastic web , the skeleton of which in @xmath63 poincar section has a form resembling that of a cobweb ( figs .",
    "[ abc : fig5](a ) , [ abe : fig6](b ) ) .",
    "we suppose that a harmonic oscillator is perturbed ( instead of @xmath64 in @xcite : cf .",
    "4(a ) ) in order to match the notation in other sections and in some figures from other works reproduced below . ] by a resonant plane wave @xcite : @xmath65 this particular model has a number of applications , especially to plasma physics @xcite and to semiconductor sls , as shown below in sec .",
    "[ superlattices ] . in order to understand the origin of the stochastic web shown in fig .",
    "[ abc : fig5 ] , we    * transform to polar coordinates @xmath66 or , equivalently , to action - angle variables @xmath37 : @xmath67 * make use of the formula @xcite @xmath68 + where @xmath69 is a bessel function of the @xmath70th order is an oscillatory function of @xmath64 with gradually decreasing amplitude as @xmath64 increases . at @xmath71 , the period of oscillation",
    "is @xmath72 while the amplitude is @xmath73 . for large @xmath64 ,",
    "the bessel function asymptotically approaches the function @xmath74 . ] .    using ( 16 ) and",
    "( 17 ) , it is not difficult to show that the hamiltonian of a harmonic oscillator perturbed by a plane wave can be represented in action - angle variables as @xmath75 note that , due to the resonance condition @xmath76 in ( 15 ) , the term in the sum in ( 18 ) corresponding to @xmath77 is nearly constant compared to other terms in the sum .",
    "so , similarly to the case of nonlinear resonance considered in section [ perturbdham ] above , it is this term that provides the major contribution to the dynamics .",
    "the other terms in the sum play the role of fast - oscillating perturbations .",
    "so we again introduce a slow variable , the angle @xmath78 .",
    "it is also convenient to introduce the normalized action @xmath79 .",
    "the dynamics of the slow variables @xmath80 is then governed by the auxiliary hamiltonian @xmath81 ( as may readily be checked by direct substitution into the hamiltonian equations of motion ) .",
    "hence    @xmath82    thus , @xmath83 is an autonomous hamiltonian that determines the main features of the motion of @xmath80 , while @xmath84 plays the role of a fast - oscillating perturbation .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the autonomous hamiltonian @xmath83 possesses a single infinite grid - like separatrix corresponding to the zero value of @xmath83 ( fig .",
    "[ abe : fig6 ] , left panel ) .",
    "the vertical filaments of the grid correspond to @xmath45 being equal to odd multiples of @xmath85 while the horizontal filaments correspond to zeros of the relevant bessel function , @xmath86    note that the grid - like separatrix does not depend on the amplitude of the original perturbation .",
    "rather its form is an inherent property of the harmonic oscillator driven by the resonant plane wave .",
    "the fast - oscillating term @xmath84 replaces this grid - like separatrix by the narrow chaotic layer .",
    "if the separatrix ( 20 ) is represented in the poincar section @xmath63 , it takes precisely the cobweb form shown schematically in the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ abe : fig6 ] .",
    "thus we have achieved the primary goal of this subsection , to explain the onset of the cobweb - like stochastic web .",
    "transport through the web is affected , not only by the shape of the web s skeleton , but also by its width , i.e.  the width of the chaotic layer ( fig.[abe : fig7 ] ) .",
    "an exact calculation of the width is a complicated task that we will not undertake here .",
    "rather , we will make a rough estimate sufficient to lead us to definite qualitative conclusions .    before doing so",
    ", we make a general comment about the width in the case of a 1d system with a separatrix that is being perturbed by a time - periodic perturbation .",
    "the width depends strongly on the ratio @xmath26 between the frequency of the perturbation @xmath87 and the frequency of small - amplitude eigenoscillations @xmath88 . a schematic representation of the typical dependence is shown in fig .",
    "[ abe : fig8 ] .",
    "this figure will be discussed in more detail in section [ modstochwebs ] . in the present context",
    "it is sufficient to emphasize that , if @xmath26 is large , then the width of the chaotic layer is _ exponentially narrow_.    let us now turn to the case of the web . as seen from ( 19 ) , the characteristic frequency of the perturbation @xmath84 is @xmath89 . on the other hand ,",
    "the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath83 is proportional to the small parameter @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , even without a careful analysis of its oscillations , it is clear that the frequency of oscillation in any cell of its grid - like separatrix is also small .",
    "thus , we conclude that the ratio @xmath26 between the perturbation frequency and the eigenfrequency is large , so that the width of the layer should be exponentially small .",
    "this conclusion is confirmed both by careful theoretical analysis and by numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "moreover , the analysis of oscillations near the elliptic points inside the cells of the separatrix of @xmath83 shows that , for cells far from the centre , the frequency of oscillation possesses the following property@xcite @xmath91 i.e.  it decreases as the distance from the centre increases .",
    "conversely , the ratio @xmath26 increases .",
    "this means that the width of the layer decreases exponentially quickly as the distance from the centre of the web increases .",
    "this conclusion is confirmed by fig .",
    "[ abc : fig5 ] above : even for the moderate @xmath90 used in this case , the width of the layer markedly decreases as the distance from the centre grows .      natural questions to ask in relation to the cobweb are : what happens if the oscillator differs slightly from an ideal harmonic oscillator ; and what happens if the resonance is inexact ?",
    "the answers were given by chernikov et al .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "they found that the effects of anharmonicity and inexact resonance are in fact similar .",
    "so in what follows we shall , for the sake of brevity , consider only the inexactness of the resonance : @xmath92 in this case , the autonomous resonance hamiltonian reads as ( cf.(19 ) ) @xmath93 as before , there are saddle points corresponding to different values of @xmath54 , namely different roots of the equation @xmath94 .",
    "but this means that , unlike the resonance case ( @xmath95 ) , the values of @xmath83 at the saddles corresponding to different @xmath54 are themselves different .",
    "this means that the single grid - like separatrix splits into infinitely many different separatrices ( fig .",
    "[ abe : fig9 ] ) .    in order for at least two lowest separatrices to be connected , allowing chaotic transport within a unified structure ( a web of a finite size , in the @xmath63 plane ) , the width of the chaotic layer should be more than , or of the order of , the difference in @xmath83 between the two lowest separatrices : @xmath96 because @xmath97 is exponentially narrow , as discussed in section [ stochwebs].2.2 above , the inequality ( 24 ) means that the stochastic web may be formed only if the perturbation frequency lies in an _ exponentially small vicinity _ of the resonance .      as already demonstrated above",
    ", the cobweb can not in practice provide transport to arbitrarily large energies because of the exponentially fast decrease in the width of the chaotic layer with distance from the centre of the web .",
    "this limitation is overcome in another type of the stochastic web , called the _ uniform web _ @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . here , instead of being perturbed by a plane wave",
    ", the harmonic oscillator is perturbed by short kicks that are periodic in space and time such that the kick frequency is equal to the eigenfrequency of the oscillator or to one of its multiples : @xmath98 the web then covers the whole phase space uniformly , as shown in fig.[abe : fig10 ] .",
    "we note however that the width of the chaotic layer is still exponentially small if the amplitude of the perturbation is small @xcite .",
    "it is clear from the above discussion that a serious limitation affecting transport through any chaotic web is the exponential narrowness of the web s chaotic layer , which leads to exponentially slow transport .",
    "soskin et al.@xcite recently suggested a way of overcoming this problem by making a subtle modification of the webs leading , in turn , to exponential growth in the width of the chaotic layer .",
    "we shall demonstrate this idea on our example of the cobweb , both because it is relevant to the application to the semiconductor sls and because , in this case , it also leads to a dramatic increase in the size of the web .",
    "we have found that there is an inherent limitation in the size of the cobweb .",
    "it does not relate to the inevitably finite time of numerical simulations , which places a practical limit on the distance over which the transport can be followed , but is characteristic of the cobweb itself .",
    "our numerical simulations show ( fig .",
    "[ abe : fig11 ] ) that , for the given parameters , the inner two - and - a - half loops of the web are distinctly _ separated _ from the adjacent outer one - and - a - half loops by regular trajectories .",
    "this might possibly be accounted for theoretically by consideration of higher - order approximations of the averaging method @xcite .",
    "we may speculate that such an approach could show that , instead of a single infinite cobweb skeleton , there are many separate separatrices ( of the one - and - a - half loop shape ) lying closely together , but that they might then coalesce due to the chaotic layers dressing them as a result of the perturbation . because the width of the layer decreases exponentially fast with increasing distance from the centre , this would mean that coalescence would occur only within a few inner loops .",
    "just this is observed in fig .",
    "[ abe : fig11 ] , even despite that @xmath90 is moderate rather than small .",
    "one may reasonably ask : _ is there any subtle way to substantially increase the size of the web and to enhance transport through it ? _    in order to answer this question , let us recall the reason for the exponential narrowness of the chaotic layer .",
    "it follows from fig .",
    "[ abe : fig8 ] that it is attributable to the frequency of the perturbation @xmath84 being much higher than the eigenfrequency of the unperturbed resonant hamiltonian @xmath83 .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ abe : fig8 ] that the width of the layer would be much larger if we could manage to modify the original system in such a way that a new perturbation of the resonance hamiltonian had a component whose frequency was of the order of , or less than , the eigenfrequency of the resonance hamiltonian @xmath83 .",
    "in fact , this may readily be accomplished in at least two different ways : ( i ) one can _ add _ to the original plane wave a small perturbation of the slightly shifted frequency ( it can itself be e.g.  a plane wave ) ; ( ii ) one can modulate weakly the _ angle _ of the original plane wave at a low frequency .",
    "we demonstrate below only the second option ( it will be especially convenient for realization of the phenomena in sls , as shown in section [ superlattices ] below ) .",
    "we therefore consider the modified system ( cf .  the original eq .",
    "( 15 ) ) : @xmath99 of course , the latter inequality can not be satisfied for an arbitrarily large @xmath44 , but it can be true for a sufficiently high value of @xmath44 which greatly exceeds the original cobweb size in terms of @xmath44 .    repeating the same procedure used above in the derivation of eq .",
    "( 19 ) , i.e.transforming to action - angle variables , introducing the slow angle @xmath45 and the auxiliary hamiltonian @xmath100 which governs the dynamics of @xmath101 , we can derive : @xmath102 ( in the derivation , we took into account in particular the smallness of @xmath53 ) .",
    "unlike the original autonomous slow resonance hamiltonian @xmath103 , the modified slow part of the hamiltonian , i.e.  @xmath104 , depends on time : it contains a term @xmath105 which oscillates at a low frequency @xmath106 .",
    "it is this slowly oscillating additional term ( rather than the former fast - oscillating perturbation term @xmath84 ) that now determines the width of the layer : the width is moderately small ( due to the smallness of @xmath53 and @xmath90 ) , rather than exponentially small as in the original setup .",
    "this exponential growth in the width of the layer gives rise to substantial growth in the size of the cobweb .    to illustrate the above ideas , we use the following example : @xmath107 .\\ ] ] for @xmath108 , this coincides with the conventional cobweb example developed in @xcite .",
    "comparison of the left and right panels of fig .",
    "[ abc : fig12 ] , corresponding to @xmath108 and @xmath109 respectively , reveals a 6-fold increase in the size of the web in terms of @xmath110 and @xmath111 : @xmath112 we emphasize that the modulation giving rise to this substantial increase is actually very small : its amplitude of 0.1 is about 60 times smaller than @xmath18 which is the relevant scale for the angle .",
    "the corresponding increase of the size in terms of energy is proportional to the square of @xmath113 : @xmath114 fig .  [",
    "abc : fig13 ] shows this explicitly and , in addition , demonstrates that the mode of transport is significantly changed .",
    "our idea of an additional small modulation of the angle of the plane wave is equally fruitful in the case of an inexact resonance .",
    "the frequency band ( around the resonance ) in which the web - like structure is formed may grow exponentially : instead of the exponentially narrow band found in the absence of modulation , we may have a moderately narrow band .",
    "moreover , there is a nontrivial spectral dependence of this growth : it reflects a universal mechanism for facilitation of the onset of chaos between adjacent separatrices , discovered recently by soskin , mannella and yevtushenko @xcite . to explain this mechanism , we use their example",
    ": it is a potential system with a spatially periodic potential possessing two barriers of different height within one period ( fig.[abc : fig14](a ) ) . naturally , there are two kinds of separatrices ( fig .",
    "[ abc : fig14](b ) ) .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the frequency of oscillation @xmath29 as a function of energy @xmath115 possesses a local maximum @xmath116 between the separatrices and , moreover , @xmath29 is close to @xmath116 over most of the inter - separatrix energy range ( fig .",
    "[ abc : fig14](c ) ) .",
    "the latter property is valid for any system with two or more separatrices and is particularly important in the present context .",
    "if we perturb the system with a time - periodic perturbation of frequency slightly lower than @xmath116 then , due to the flatness of @xmath31 over most of the inter - separatrix range of @xmath115 , two nonlinear resonances arise that are very wide in terms of energy .",
    "even a rather small amplitude of perturbation may be sufficient for these nonlinear resonances to overlap with each other and with the separatrix chaotic layers , thus connecting the latter by the chaotic transport .",
    "this has been confirmed both theoretically and in numerical simulations .",
    "consequently , a critical perturbation amplitude @xmath117 is required for chaotic transport between the separatrix chaotic layers ( which may be considered as the onset of global chaos between them ) . as a function of the perturbation frequency @xmath26",

    "the dynamics of the system is fully determined by the dynamics of @xmath136 .",
    "fig.[abc : fig19 ] shows how the trajectory of an electron in the @xmath64-@xmath128 plane changes with the angle of the magnetic field .    at @xmath140 ,",
    "the plane wave has zero amplitude and the motion along the @xmath64- and @xmath128-directions is separable .",
    "electrons undergo bloch oscillations along @xmath64 ( due to the presence of the constant electric field ) and cyclotron motion about @xmath141 ( fig .",
    "[ abc : fig19](a ) ) .",
    "the motion is localized .",
    "tilting @xmath141 produces nonlinear coupling of the bloch and cyclotron motion : as @xmath142 , the plane wave in ( 34 ) acquires a non - zero amplitude .",
    "this causes some moderate delocalization of trajectories ( fig .",

    "the delocalization grows very fast ( fig .",
    "[ abc : fig19](c ) ) when @xmath134 reaches values corresponding to the integer values @xmath143 , in other words to the resonance @xmath76 .",
    "this strong delocalization in @xmath64 is a consequence of the onset of the stochastic web for the motion of @xmath136 ( 34 ) .",
    "it is remarkable that the quantum probability density @xmath144 , calculated by solution of the schrdinger equation in the sl model potential subjected to electric and magnetic fields should so nicely follow quasi - classical trajectories based on the dynamics of @xmath136 ( 34 ) : see fig.[abc : fig19 ] .    as shown in @xcite ,",
    "the delocalization of the electrons strongly affects their drift velocity @xmath145 and , as a consequence , the current @xmath44 and the current - voltage dependence @xmath146 .",
    "there are clear manifestations of the resonances , both in the theoretical curves @xmath147 , @xmath146 , @xmath148 ( see fig.[abc : fig18](d ) , fig .",
    "[ abc : fig20](c ) and fig .",
    "[ abc : fig20](d ) respectively ) , and in the experimental curves @xmath146 and @xmath148 ( figs .",
    "[ abc : fig20](a ) and ( b ) respectively ) .",
    "thus there is clear evidence for stochastic web formation in quantum electron transport , providing the basis for a conceptually new method for its control .",
    "when scattering is included _ a priori _ in the semiclassical equations of motion , the stochastic web , and stable islands that it enmeshes , evolve into limit cycles",
    ". these limit cycles also exhibit sharp resonant delocalization and their locations in phase space closely reflect the underlying web topology @xcite .",
    "finally , we pose a question : could the modification of the stochastic web discussed in the previous section be of use for the sls ?",
    "its seems @xcite that this is indeed the case .",
    "as shown in section [ modstochwebs ] above , modulation of the wave angle results in a large increase of the web size . it was noted in @xcite that the delocalization in @xmath64 is proportional to the web size in terms of the energy of the oscillator in @xmath136 , i.e.  to @xmath149 ( cf.fig .",
    "[ abc : fig19 ] ) .",
    "the only question is how the sl should be perturbed in order for the modulation term to appear in the dynamical equation for @xmath136 .",
    "one suggestion @xcite is that , in a manner similar to the derivation of eq .",
    "( 34 ) , one can show that the modulation term in the equation for @xmath136 appears if an ac - component is added to the constant electric field :    @xmath150    then , the following modulation term is added in the wave angle in eq .  ( 34 ) : @xmath151 to compare the resulting equation with the example ( 28 ) that we studied numerically , we transform to normalized time @xmath152 then the equation of motion for @xmath136 is : @xmath153 where all other parameters are as in eq .",
    "( 34 ) .",
    "thus , if the parameters are similar to those in ( 28 ) , in particular : @xmath109 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , then we will have an enlargement in @xmath115 as found for eq .",
    "( 28 ) : @xmath156 . in order to achieve this ,",
    "we need @xmath157 .",
    "this means that in order to achieve delocalization of the electron by a factor of about 40 , we need to add to the constant electric field an ac - component of amplitude that is smaller than the constant component by a factor of 2000 !",
    "we remind the reader that the reason for such a dramatic change when an ac - component is added is the exponentially strong enhancement of chaotic transport through the stochastic web due to the modulation of the wave angle .    recently",
    ", the effects of stochastic web formation on the high - frequency ( ghz - thz ) performance of the sls has been considered @xcite .",
    "modulation of the @xmath147 curves , induced by stochastic web formation , leads to the formation of multiple propagating electron accumulation and depletion regions ( charge domains ) , which greatly increase both the strength and frequency of the associated temporal current oscillations .",
    "chaos - assisted motion through stochastic webs may , therefore , provide a mechanism for controlling the collective dynamics of electrons in sls and , hence , for enhancing their thz performance by using _ single - particle _ miniband transport to tailor the shape of the @xmath147 curves .",
    "we have shown that , in general , there is a possibility for energy in a hamiltonian system to be increased from small to rather large values as a result of transport through a stochastic web .    in a multi - dimensional system ,",
    "the onset of a stochastic web is a common phenomenon , predicted by arnold in 1964 . in the present review ,",
    "we have been more interested in the low - dimensional stochastic webs discovered by chernikov et al .  in the late 1980s .",
    "they occur in special situations : in a harmonic , or nearly harmonic , oscillator driven by perturbations periodic in time and space that are resonant , or nearly resonant , with the oscillator .",
    "we emphasized that the stochastic cobweb can arise when the oscillator is driven by a weak resonant , or nearly resonant , plane wave .",
    "the exponentially small width of a strand of the web is a characteristic feature of all stochastic webs and it decreases exponentially fast as the distance from the centre of the cobweb increases .",
    "moreover there is an inherent limitation on the size of the cobweb .",
    "soskin et al .",
    "have suggested how to overcome the restriction in size of the cobweb and the exponential narrowness of its chaotic layer , just by slightly modifying the system by means of a small slow modulation of the angle of the plane wave .",
    "the model of the stochastic web turned out to be directly relevant to the quantum transport of electrons in semiconductor sls in constant electric and magnetic fields , as demonstrated by fromhold et al . :",
    "the quantum transport dynamics reduces to the model of the harmonic oscillator perturbed by a plane wave , where parameters are determined by the values of the electric and magnetic fields , by the angle between them , by the period of the sl , by the charge and the effective mass of the electron , and by planck s constant . at certain values of the parameters",
    ", in particular of the electric field , resonance occurs between the oscillator and the plane wave , resulting in the onset of the stochastic cobweb and , consequently , in a strong delocalization of the electron which , in turn , increases the current and gives rise to a peak in the dependence of the differential conductivity on voltage .",
    "an addition to the constant electric field of a small slow ac - component results in the slow modulation of the plane angle and , therefore , promises to strongly increase the delocalization of the electron and to enhance a range of related phenomena .",
