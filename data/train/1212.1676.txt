    "a large chunk of which has focused on the prototypical setting of the @xmath0-symmetric dimer , there emerges a problem of effect of @xmath0 symmetry and nonlinearity on the polarization of the electric field . in that regard ,",
    "the previously proposed settings , to the best of our knowledge , were chiefly focused on effectively scalar models . on the other hand ,",
    "the `` vector '' type of problems is natural for experimental settings where the exploited fibers obey birefringence , since the two orthogonal polarizations are to be taken into account  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we consider a @xmath0-symmetric coupler whose arms are birefringent waveguides .",
    "assuming that the first waveguide is active and the second one is absorbing , we address the problem of a @xmath0-preserving ( in the linear limit ) configuration . while being an interesting model from a physical point of view , this setting also offers a different ( in comparison to what was studied before ) mathematical situation where the nonlinear modes bifurcate from doubly degenerated eigenvalues of the linear problem .",
    "this requires the generalization of earlier developed approaches ( e.g. like the one reported in @xcite ) for the bifurcation of the nonlinear modes from the linear spectrum .",
    "in addition , it presents a rich playground for dynamical systems analysis , due to the emergence of a variety of saddle - center bifurcations ( nonlinear analogs of the linear @xmath0-phase transition ) , as well as symmetry - breaking ( pitchfork ) ones .",
    "it is these nonlinear states , their emergence , stability , dynamics and the asymptotics of the system that we will focus on hereafter .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : model ] , we present the model in its evolution as well as in its stationary form . in section  [ sec : lin ] , we focus on its linear properties .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : nonlin ] , we examine the nonlinear modes ( and bifurcations ) .",

    "the algebraic conditions that this family of solutions satisfies are @xmath148 notice that the imaginary part of the propagation constant @xmath149 is proportional to the difference @xmath150 .",
    "hence , prior to the symmetry breaking , the relevant solutions bear a real propagation constant . past the bifurcation point one ( unstable )",
    "branch has @xmath151 , while the stable branch has @xmath152 .",
    "the relevant ghost state branches and their bifurcation from the equal amplitude ones are explored in fig .",
    "[ a0b2k1]-[a1b2k1 ] . given that these are only ghost solutions of the original dynamical problem , the interpretation of their linearization spectrum ( shown for completeness in fig .",
    "[ a0b2k1_s ] ) is still an open problem .",
    "these ghost states appear , in fact , to exhibit very similar evolution dynamics to regular unstable states .",
    "to illustrate this , we observed the particular behavior of the unstable modes and how it depends on the form of the initial perturbation .",
    "a typical example in which the gain sites lead to growth and the lossy sites to decay is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn1 ] .",
    "it is interesting that the evolution appears to be very proximal to that of the ghost states identified above .",
    "this is clearly showcased in fig .",
    "[ a0b2k1_ghostb ] , through the comparison of the growth pattern in the relevant sites ( and the decay pattern in the lossy sites ) with the exact , shifted in the propagation distance to fit the onset of growth , ghost state solution for the same parameters . on the other hand , in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn1 ] a different scenario of evolution is illustrated . instead of the gain nodes growing and the lossy ones decaying , a breathing oscillation settles between the two pairs .",
    "these two scenarios , illustrated in fig .  [ fig : dyn1 ] , are the prototypical instability evolution ones that we have obtained in this system .    , @xmath135 and for @xmath36 for two different small initial perturbations .",
    "the result of the evolution of the left panel involves growth at the gain sites ( @xmath153 , red curves in the color online version ) and decay at the lossy sites ( @xmath154 , blue curves in the color online version ) .",
    "notice that intensities among the two gain sites and among the two lossy sites are approximately equal ( @xmath155 and @xmath156 ) and are not distinguishable in the scale of the plots . in the right panel only the initial stage of the found persistent periodic dynamics is shown ; the simulations were performed up to @xmath157 . ]    , @xmath142 , and @xmath134 for @xmath158 .",
    "the red solid line and blue dashed line correspond to the red diamond and magenta plus branches in fig .",

    "the blue dashed line is plotted with a shift in time , i.e. delay by @xmath159 .",
    "the time axis in the plot is the actual time of the red solid line .",
    "their dynamical behaviors are essentially identical ( and can not be distinguished on the scale of the plot ) , showcasing how the unstable dynamics of the red diamond branch is similar to that of the bifurcating ghost . ]",
    "in conclusion , in the present work , we have proposed a novel , physically realistic variant of a @xmath0 symmetric dimer where the effect of birefringence has been taken into consideration . the existence of polarization of the electric field within the coupler yields two complex dynamical equations for each of the fibers , providing a physical realization of a plaquette model with _ both linear and nonlinear _ coupling between the elements .",
    "the stationary states of the model were identified and both linear and nonlinear @xmath0-phase transitions were obtained .",
    "the degenerate nature of the linear limit complicated the problem in comparison to other ones studied earlier in this context .",
    "furthermore , the emergence of symmetry breaking phenomena and associated ( subcritical or supercritical ) pitchfork bifurcations , as well as their dynamical implications in leading to indefinite growth and decay ( of the corresponding waveguide amplitudes ) were elucidated .",
    "a connection was also given to ghost states .    from the physical point of view",
    ", we emphasize that the use of @xmath0 symmetry significantly changes the stability of the modes with different polarizations . for example , in the case of large propagation constant mismatches , we saw that the symmetric ( circularly polarized ) states become destabilized in the presence of gain / loss and may even cease to exist past a certain critical point of the relevant parameter . instead of them",
    ", the dynamics may lead to a breathing exchange of `` mass '' between the gain and the lossy waveguides , or most commonly an indefinite growth of the former at the expense of the latter .",
    "this is in line with what is observed also in the evolution of the emerging ghost states of the system .",
    "the instabilities and associated dynamics should be observable in suitable generalizations of existing experiments such as  @xcite .",
    "such properties are relevant also to possibilities of solitonic ( waveguide - array ) generalizations of the coupler system as well as towards a possible use of @xmath0 symmetric coupler for measurement techniques based on the use of several nonlinear modes . from the mathematical point of view",
    ", we believe that these studies may pave the way for considering multi - component , as well as multi - dimensional ( generalizing the plaquettes considered here or those of  @xcite ) lattice models of @xmath0-symmetric form . in generalizing to multi - plaquette configurations , it would be especially interesting to examine which of the symmetry - breaking and nonlinear @xmath0-phase transition phenomena examined herein are preserved and what new phenomena may arise as additional degrees of freedom are added .",
