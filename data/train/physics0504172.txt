    "recently , we discussed local and linear media in classical electrodynamics @xcite . in particular , we investigated possible magnetoelectric effects , which are related to the crossterms between the magnetic ( electric ) field strength and the electric ( magnetic ) excitation . using the premetric formalism of electrodynamics ,",
    "see @xcite , the most general local and linear constitutive relation can be written as @xmath0 here @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the electric and magnetic excitations , respectively , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 the electric and the magnetic field strengths .",
    "the kronecker symbol is denoted by @xmath5 , the totally antisymmetric levi - civita symbol by @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "we have 36 constitutive functions or moduli : the permittivity matrix @xmath8 ( 6 independent components ) , the impermeability matrix @xmath9 ( 6 components ) , the tracefree principal magnetoelectric matrix @xmath10 ( 8 components ) , the 15 skewon pieces @xmath11 , and , eventually , 1 axion piece @xmath12 . such a local and linear medium with 36 moduli",
    " called sometimes bi - anisotropic  has been considered , amongst others , by lindell , sihvola , tretyakov , and collaborators @xcite .    in conventional materials",
    "the _ skewon _ and the _ axion _ pieces _ vanish _ and we are left with @xmath13 the principal magnetoelectric cross terms induced by @xmath10 are known to exist in various media , see odell @xcite .",
    "such media are described by @xmath14 constitutive functions .",
    "eqs.([convent1 ] ) and ( [ convent2 ] ) represent the most general material considered by post @xcite , e.g ..    the skewon pieces are not considered in this article , see , however , @xcite .",
    "we address here the question on whether the axion piece is permitted  thereby possibly extending a material with 20 moduli to one with 21 moduli  and if so whether it can be determined experimentally by standard methods . in post",
    "@xcite it was argued that the axion piece has to vanish , i.e. , @xmath15 ( and even @xmath16 ) .",
    "for this reason , lakhtakia @xcite ( and references given there ) called @xmath17 the post constraint and advocated it as a condition each medium has to fulfill .",
    "we quoted in @xcite literature in which materials are described ( cr@xmath18o@xmath19 and fe@xmath18teo@xmath20 ) that carry an axion piece .",
    "moreover , lakhtakia , loc.cit . , pointed out that a constant axion piece @xmath12 should not be measurable since it drops out of the maxwell equations .",
    "however , this is only true if we have an axion piece that is _ globally constant _ at _ all _ spatial points at _ all _ times .",
    "we will show explicitly that a material with a piecewise constant @xmath21 can very well be investigated experimentally and thereby @xmath21 measured uniquely .",
    "thus , neither can the post constraint be uphold @xcite nor poses the measurability of @xmath21 a problem , as we will show below .",
    "accordingly , we discuss here the case of two neighboring homogeneous media with different but constant axion pieces .",
    "they are separated by the plane @xmath22 , as shown in fig.1 .",
    "permittivity and permeability are assumed to be isotropic .",
    "thus , the constitutive relations for the two half - spaces carry 3 constitutive constants @xmath23 , and @xmath21 , respectively , @xmath24 with @xmath25 as the 3-dimensional hodge star operator and @xmath26 and @xmath27 as electric and magnetic constants ( of the vacuum ) .",
    "we use here the calculus of differential forms , see @xcite .    as sideremark let us remind ourselves that ( [ con2 ] ) , ( [ con1 ] ) , formulated 4-dimensionally with the excitation 2-form @xmath28 and the field strength 2-form @xmath29 and _ in vacuum , _ reduce to axion ( maxwell - lorentz ) electrodynamics ( see ni @xcite and wilczek @xcite ) with the constitutive relation @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the 4-dimensional hodge star operator defined in terms of the metric of spacetime .",
    "the field equations read @xmath32 it is as if the current 3-form @xmath33 picked up an additional piece depending on the gradient of the axion field . for @xmath34 ,",
    "this corresponds to the pure axion case , that is , to the perfect electromagnetic conductor ( pemc ) of lindell and sihvola @xcite , a structure that is equivalent to the tellegen gyrator @xcite , see also @xcite . the real part of kiehn s _ chiral vacuum _ ( see @xcite and @xcite , pp",
    ".  140/141 ) is a subcase , for @xmath35 , of axion electrodynamics .",
    "thus we see that if the axion piece is globally constant , @xmath36const , it does not contribute to the maxwell equations ( [ maxax ] ) , even though it emerges in the constitutive relation ( [ vac ] ) and in the boundary conditions to be discussed in the next section .",
    "the maxwell equations without charges and currents read @xmath37 the calculus of differential forms is used and the conventions of @xcite . in the absence of the surface charges and currents , the jump conditions on the boundary surface read ( see @xcite , pp .",

    "the constitutive relations were formulated in ( [ con2 ] ) and ( [ con1 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath40 be the plane @xmath22 in fig.1 that divides the two parts of space that are filled with two different homogeneous material media .",
    "for the left half - space @xmath43 , we assume homogeneous matter characterized by constant values @xmath44 .",
    "similarly , for the right half - space @xmath45 , we have the constant values @xmath46 .",
    "somewhat related situations with reflected and scattered waves were discussed by lindell and sihvola @xcite .",
    "consider a plane electromagnetic wave travelling along the @xmath47 axis in the left half - space . at the interface @xmath40 , such an incident wave will be partly reflected and partly refracted into the right half - space .",
