    "this paper studies the capacity of multipath ( frequency - selective ) fading channels .",
    "a noncoherent channel model is considered where neither transmitter nor receiver are cognizant of the fading s realization , but both are aware of its statistic .",
    "our focus is on the high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) regime .",
    "for the special case of noncoherent _ frequency - flat _ fading channels ( where we have only _ one _ path ) , it was shown by lapidoth & moser @xcite that if the fading process is of finite entropy rate , then at high snr capacity grows double - logarithmically with the snr .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the logarithmic growth of the capacity of coherent fading channels ( where the realization of the fading is known to the receiver ) @xcite .",
    "thus , communicating over noncoherent flat - fading channels at high snr is power inefficient .",
    "recently , it has been demonstrated that communicating over noncoherent _ multipath _ fading channels at high snr is not merely power inefficient , but may be even worse : if the delay spread is large in the sense that the variances of the path gains decay _ exponentially or slower _",
    ", then capacity is _ bounded _ in the snr ; see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm .  1 ) .",
    "for such channels , capacity does not tend to infinity as the snr tends to infinity .",
    "in contrast , if the variances of the path gains decay _ faster than double - exponentially _ , then capacity is _ unbounded _ in the snr ; see ( * ? ? ? * thm .  2 ) .",
    "this condition is certainly satisfied if the number of paths is finite , i.e. , if the channel output is only influenced by the present and by the @xmath0 previous channel inputs .",
    "( here only the variances of the first @xmath1 path gains are positive , while the other variances are zero . )",
    "it was shown in @xcite that in this case capacity is not only unbounded in the snr , but its growth with the @xmath2 is also independent of the number of paths and equals the growth of the capacity of noncoherent frequency - flat fading channels , i.e. , @xmath3 thus , for finite @xmath0 , the capacity pre - loglog is unaffected by the number of paths @xmath0 .",
    "the above results demonstrate that whether the capacity of a multipath channel is unbounded in the snr depends critically on the decay rate of the variances of the path gains .",
    "however , ( * ? ? ?",
    "1 ) only accounts for decay rates that are exponentially or slower , whereas ( * ? ? ?",

    "2 ) fail to characterize the capacity of channels for which the variances of the path gains decay faster than exponentially but slower than double - exponentially . in this paper , we bridge this gap by showing that if the variances of the path gains decay faster than exponentially , then capacity is unbounded in the snr .",
    "let @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the set of complex numbers and the set of positive integers , respectively .",
    "we consider a discrete - time multipath fading channel whose channel output @xmath6 at time @xmath7 corresponding to the time-1 through time-@xmath8 channel inputs @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 here @xmath11 models additive noise , and @xmath12 denotes the time-@xmath8 gain of the @xmath13-th path .",
    "we assume that @xmath11 is a sequence of independent and identically distributed ( iid ) , zero - mean , variance-@xmath14 , circularly - symmetric , complex gaussian random variables . for each path @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 denotes the set of nonnegative integers ) , we assume that @xmath17 is a zero - mean , complex stationary process .",

    "we further assume that @xmath21 and @xmath22 where the set @xmath23 is defined as @xmath24 .",
    "we finally assume that the processes @xmath25 are independent ( `` uncorrelated scattering '' ) ; that they are jointly independent of @xmath11 ; and that the joint law of @xmath26 does not depend on the input sequence @xmath27 .",
    "we consider a noncoherent channel model where neither transmitter nor receiver is cognizant of the realization of @xmath17 , @xmath15 , but both are aware of their law .",

    "( see @xcite for a definition of an achievable rate . )",
    "we do not claim that there is a coding theorem associated with , i.e. , that @xmath34 is achievable .",
    "a coding theorem will hold , for example , if there are only @xmath1 paths ( for some @xmath35 ) , and if the processes corresponding to these paths @xmath36 are jointly ergodic , see @xcite .    in @xcite a necessary and a sufficient condition for @xmath34 to be bounded in @xmath2",

    "as this can be made arbitrarily large by choosing @xmath113 sufficiently small , we conclude that @xmath114 implies that @xmath34 is unbounded in snr .",
    "we studied the capacity of discrete - time , noncoherent , multipath fading channels .",
    "it was shown that if the variances of the path gains decay faster than exponentially , then capacity is unbounded in the snr .",
    "this complements previous results obtained in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the overall picture looks as follows :    * if the number of paths is infinite in the sense that the channel output is influenced by the present and by _ all _ previous channel inputs , and if the variances of the path gains decay exponentially or slower , then capacity is bounded even as the snr grows without bound . *",
    "if the number of paths is infinite but the variances of the path gains decay faster than exponentially , then capacity tends to infinity as @xmath109 . * if the number of paths is finite , then , irrespective of the number of paths , the capacity pre - loglog is @xmath115 .",
    "thus , in this case the multipath behavior has no significant effect on the high - snr capacity .",
    "we thus see that the high - snr behavior of the capacity of noncoherent multipath fading channels depends critically on the assumed channel model .",
    "consequently , when studying such channels at high snr , the channel modeling is crucial , as slight changes in the model might lead to completely different capacity results .",
