    "despite its simplicity , the london approach is a powerful tool in describing magnetic properties of the mixed state .",
    "in fact , short of the full - blown microscopic theory , it is the only method available for low temperatures .",
    "the approach is based on the london equation : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the magnetic field , @xmath7 is the penetration depth ( a temperature dependent _ constant _ in uniform samples ) , @xmath8 is the flux quantum , and @xmath9 are vortex positions . for simplicity , the equation is written for isotropic materials .",
    "this approach fails at distances of the order of the coherence length @xmath10 ; still , in materials with @xmath11 , there is a broad domain of intermediate fields @xmath12 where the complexity of the vortex core contributions to the total energy can be disregarded and the london approach suffices for the description of macroscopic magnetic properties .    as far as the equilibrium properties of the flux - line lattice are concerned , the pivotal point is the expression for the free energy @xmath13 the right - hand side here is the interaction energy of vortices forming a periodic lattice , @xmath14 is the magnetic induction .",
    "this expression is obtained by transforming the sum of pair - wise interactions of vortices to a sum over the reciprocal lattice , see e.g. , ref .. the sum ( or the integral over the reciprocal plane @xmath15 ) is logarithmically divergent so that a cutoff at @xmath16 is needed ( @xmath17 is the size of the vortex core ) .",
    "this yields @xmath18 .",
    "the parameter @xmath19 of the order unity is commonly introduced to account for uncertainty of the cutoff ( along with the uncertainty in the lower limit of the integral of the order of inverse intervortex spacing @xmath20 ) ; @xmath21 ... appears in eq.([f_lond ] ) for convenience of not having it in the expression for the magnetization .",
    "again , the energy in the form of eq.([f_lond ] ) holds in intermediate fields @xmath22 , the domain existing only in materials with large ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath2 ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the lower and upper critical fields ) .",
    "hence , although the length @xmath10 ( or the core size @xmath17 ) does not appear in the london equation ( [ london ] ) , it enters the energy expression ( [ f_lond ] ) through the cutoff and therefore affects , presumably weakly , macroscopic quantities such as the magnetization and other properties of the mixed state .",
    "significant effort has recently been put in studies of the vortex core size @xmath17 ; see the review by sonier and references therein.@xcite notably , whatever definition of @xmath17 is adopted , the low temperature @xmath17 ( extracted from the @xmath4sr data ) decreases with increasing applied magnetic field in a number of materials such as nbse@xmath25 , v@xmath26si , luni@xmath25b@xmath25c , yba@xmath25cu@xmath26o@xmath27 , and ceru@xmath25 ; their physical characteristics have little to do with one other , except that all of them have a large gl parameter @xmath28 and exhibit large regions of reversible magnetic behavior .",
    "one can add to this list a heavy fermion compound cecoin@xmath29 , for which the interpretation of small angle neutron scattering data ( sans ) requires a similar behavior of the coherence length.@xcite the dependencies @xmath30 for all tested materials are qualitatively similar : when the field increases toward @xmath24 , @xmath31 decreases roughly as @xmath32 . in other words , in large fields",
    "@xmath17 is roughly proportional to the intervortex spacing .",
    "a few qualitative reasons for the core shrinking with increasing field have been discussed in literature ; see the review .",
    "perhaps the simplest defines the core boundary as a position where the divergent london current @xmath33 of an isolated vortex reaches the depairing value , i.e. , as @xmath34 . in the mixed state ,",
    "neighboring vortices suppress the circulating current by contributing currents of the opposite direction .",
    "hence , the depairing value is reached at a shorter distance from the vortex center , and consequently @xmath17 should decrease with increasing field .",
    "the vortex core size , @xmath17 , is of the order of the coherence length @xmath10 and , in fact , it is often identified with @xmath35 . strictly speaking ,",
    "the latter is defined only at the upper critical field : @xmath36 .",
    "nevertheless the length @xmath10 is used to describe the mixed state at fields not necessarily close to @xmath24 .",
    "the question of possible field dependence of @xmath10 has been considered by one of us for the isotropic case.@xcite it was shown that in the dirty limit one can use @xmath37 at any field within the mixed phase ; the same is true near the critical temperature @xmath38 for any scattering strength .",
    "however , in general , when the field is reduced below @xmath24 , the value of @xmath0 increases , an effect that is profound in clean materials at low temperatures .",
    "calculations of ref .",
    "are in accord with the @xmath4sr results cited above . in the following ,",
    "we denote as @xmath39 the value of @xmath0 at @xmath40 to stress that in general @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",
    "another common theoretical definition of @xmath17 is based on the slope of the order parameter @xmath43 at the vortex axis @xmath44 , normalized either to its value @xmath45 far from the single vortex or to the value of @xmath46 half - way to the nearest neighbor in the mixed state : @xmath47 .",
    "recent microscopic calculations of this quantity by miranovi _",
    "et al . _ showed a variety of field dependent behaviors of @xmath17 at low temperatures depending on the scattering strength.@xcite in particular , this work suggests that @xmath30 may have a minimum which , however , has not been seen in @xmath4sr experiments .",
    "there are many different ways to define @xmath17 customized for different experimental or theoretical needs ( see , e.g. , the discussion in ref . ) . for the purpose of this paper , these differences are irrelevant and we use the terms @xmath48 and @xmath49 as the same .    in the following we provide experimental data for the field dependence of the reversible magnetization for a single crystal yni@xmath25b@xmath25c in a broad temperature region to demonstrate the known fact :",
    "the data can not be described by the standard london model .",
    "we then derive a closed form expression for the cutoff @xmath0 needed to represent correctly the data @xmath50 with the help of the london model .",
    "we show that @xmath0 so chosen is qualitatively consistent with the field dependence of @xmath10 recorded by @xmath4sr and discussed theoretically . finally , we demonstrate that the new model generates a consistent description of the magnetization data for a number of unrelated materials with large @xmath2 .",
    "the goal of this paper is to demonstrate that @xmath0 can be in principle extracted from the magnetization data , a less demanding experimental procedure as compared to @xmath4sr or sans . within our approach , _ the london penetration depth is field independent _ , whereas the field dependence of @xmath10 alone suffices to explain the data .",

    "mgb@xmath25 single crystals of submillimeter sizes were grown by a high pressure technique as described in ref ..    a single crystal of v@xmath26si was grown using a bridgeman method , in which a floating zone was created by rf induction heating .",

    "the standard london energy ( [ f_lond ] ) gives an equilibrium magnetization that is linear in @xmath63 in intermediate fields : @xmath64 hence , the standard london model requires a plot of @xmath62 versus @xmath63 to be a straight line .",

    "we stress that the expression ( [ m_exp ] ) is just an empirical formula to represent the data .",
    "we choose it because of its simplicity , and because - as is demonstrated below - it is sufficiently flexible to represent the magnetization data in a host of materials with very different physical properties .",

    "the value of the upper critical field for each @xmath68 is read directly from the raw data as explained in fig.[fraw ] .",

    "examining possible modifications of the london model to account for the deviations of @xmath3 of fig.([fynbc ] ) from linear behavior , one should bear in mind the difference between the roles of two fundamental lengths , @xmath7 and @xmath10 , within the london theory .",
    "the length @xmath7 enters eq.([london ] ) which is the basis of the whole approach . on the other hand ,",
    "the length @xmath10 is absent in the london equation and enters the energy expression as an uncertain cutoff used to mend the inherent shortcoming of the london model .",
    "therefore , considering possible modifications of this model , one still has some freedom - however limited - in working with @xmath10 , unlike the case of @xmath7 .    comparing the data of fig([fynbc ] ) with predictions of the standard",

    "the london theory is rigid with respect to a constancy of @xmath7 , unlike the case of @xmath10 .    yet , quite often , analyzing data with the help of the london model ( i.e. , starting with a constant @xmath7 ) it is concluded that @xmath7 should be field dependent .",
    "numerous examples are found in the literature on @xmath4sr ( see , e.g. , ref . ) and in many recent publications on mgb@xmath25.@xcite an operational `` justification implied for this apparent contradiction usually goes like this : of course , the field distribution for a single vortex is described by eq.([london ] ) with a constant @xmath7 . however , in the mixed state the average order parameter is suppressed by overlapping vortex fields , and therefore , the macroscopic '' @xmath149 ( @xmath150 to @xmath7 calculated for @xmath151 ) should enter the free energy eq.([f_lond ] ) .",
    "this macroscopic parameter may depend on the average magnetic field @xmath14 .",
    "the inconsistency of such an argument is exposed if one considers the clean limit at zero temperature . in this case",
    "the london @xmath7 does not depend on the order parameter ( in fact , it depends only on the total electron density ) , so that the mixed - state order parameter suppression can not be reffered to as a general justification for employing @xmath152 .      the quantity @xmath153 is often taken as a measure of the superfluid density @xmath154 .",
    "this assignment has unambiguous justification only for isotropic superconductors ( see , e.g. , ref . ) and when @xmath155 is defined as the penetration depth of a small magnetic field ( strictly speaking in the limit @xmath156 ) .",
    "one of the attractive features of the standard london theory is that one can extract @xmath157 directly from the magnetization ( [ m_lond ] ) by measuring the constant slope @xmath158 for each temperature . this way of determining the superfluid density @xmath154 rests , therefore , upon whether or not the standard london model for @xmath62 is valid . as we have seen in a number of examples above , this is quite often not the case .",
    "perhaps the best example of the futility of extracting @xmath154 from magnetization data is provided by the data for v@xmath26si . as is seen in fig.[fv3si ] , e.g. , for @xmath159k , the slope @xmath158 decreases with the field increasing up to @xmath160 t , but it grows with further field increase toward @xmath24 .",
    "if one takes literally the proportionality between @xmath154 and the slope @xmath158 , one should conclude that the field suppresses the  superfluid density \" as long as @xmath14 is under @xmath161 t but for @xmath162 t , @xmath154 is enhanced by increasing field .",
    "hence , extracting any quantitative information about the superfluid density or the penetration depth from the magnetization data with the help of the _ standard _ london model should be taken  with a grain of salt \" at best even for such  simple \" materials as v@xmath26si , not to speak about mgb@xmath25 in which the different field behavior of the two gaps further complicates the matter.@xcite    to summarize , the field dependence of the core size @xmath0 has been incorporated in the london model to describe intermediate field reversible magnetization @xmath1 for materials with large @xmath2 . the dependence @xmath0 is directly related to deviations in @xmath3 from linear behavior prescribed by the standard london model . a method to extract @xmath0 from the magnetization data",
    "is proposed .",
    "for most materials examined , @xmath0 so obtained decreases with increasing field ; the dependence becomes weaker with increasing temperature or with strengthening the non - magnetic scattering , in qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions and with existing @xmath4sr , sans , and flux - flow resistivity data .",
    "the method , however , fails when applied to mgb@xmath25 and - surprisingly - to v@xmath26si , the subject for a separate discussion .",
