    "[ i m ]    it is well known in quantum mechanics that a spectral line composed by different components can be split under the presence of a static perturbative magnetic field .",
    "this fact , the so - called zeeman effect , implies that multiple orbits of an electron can be generated with the introduction of a perturbation . similarly in this study , we show that degenerate states of shear flow can be detected with the introduction of a computational perturbation .",
    "turbulent channel flow is not only one of the fundamental themes pursued in the field of fluid physics , but also of great engineering importance .",
    "historically , attempts to computationally model turbulent flow and understand its origins , structure and evolution were based on statistical approaches .",
    "since the details of the aperiodicity ( in velocity fields for example ) observed in experiments or in numerical simulations are not of prime interest , one usually tries to characterise turbulent systems by their statistical and time averaged properties .",
    "although it is widely accepted that the navier - stokes equations should provide the correct basis for an accurate description of turbulent fluid flow , it is regrettable that rather little information from the equations , enters into the statistical analysis .",
    "more recently , the sequence of bifurcations / deterministic approach has emerged as a popular tool due to the discovery of coherent solutions that are universal .",
    "they exist in a variety of fluid flows as invariant sets within the turbulent regime and they have been obtained without the presumption of favourable or pre - set conditions deduced from empirical laws",
    ". moreover the discovery of coherent structures indicates the existence of order within the evident aperiodicity of turbulence , that in turn could be used to probe aperiodic motion in a deterministic way .",
    "therefore the sequential bifurcation approach , that identifies coherent structures and examines their stability , can potentially overcome many difficulties associated with transitions to turbulence .    in order to describe in general terms the sequential bifurcation approach that will be followed in the next sections , we introduce the governing equation of fluid motion : @xmath0 in the set of partial differential equations ( [ basic ] ) @xmath1 describes the deviation from the basic ( undisturbed ) state of the system , @xmath2 is a linear and @xmath3 is a nonlinear operator that involve partial derivatives . in ( [ basic ] ) @xmath4 represents collectively the parameters of the system , such as the prandtl , the rayleigh or the reynolds numbers . in our sequential bifurcation approach",
    "we will be employing ( [ basic ] ) and we first obtain the stability of the basic state via the introduction of infinitesimal disturbances in ( [ basic ] ) and by ignoring the nonlinear terms .",
    "the nonlinear states grow from the stability boundary of the basic state , that is typically characterised by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the neutral surface of the basic state .",
    "if we repeat the aforementioned procedure of perturbation on the obtained nonlinear states , we could find a successive sequence of bifurcations for the higher order states en route to turbulence .",
    "we intend to deduce , or identify , numerically coherent structures for given values of the control parameters , for the case when the fluid is interacting with plates of infinite extent .",
    "this is because the flow , in this case , is free from the influence of the presence of end boundaries at inlet or the outlet in the upstream and donwstream ends of the channel .",
    "additionally the proposition of the infinite channel allows the introduction of fourier expansions into the simulations for the streamwise and spanwise directions .    from the theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "let us suppose a numerical channel with the gap width , @xmath7 , under the periodic boundary conditions with wave numbers @xmath8 and @xmath9 in the streamwise and spanwise directions.this channel is the subspace of another numerical channel with the same gap width but with ( subharmonic ) wave numbers @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 are arbitrary positive integers .",
    "an exact equilibrium state realised in the fundamental channel is definitely an exact state in the subharmonic channel.the latter exact state may bifurcate from the former exact state , which is traditionally termed as the subharmonic bifurcation . taking an infinite number of the combinations @xmath13 into account ,",
    "multiplicity of the exact states exists inevitably in the channel with infinite extent . in this manuscript",
    "we will provide an example of how to probe previously unexplored subharmonic branches by a simple perturbation , without the traditional approach of linear stability analysis using floquet parameters .    in the following section",
    ", we formulate the problem and identify the basic state determined uniquely from the homogeneous external conditions .",
    "we obtain the stability boundary of the basic state in section @xmath14 , and proceed to solve ( [ basic ] ) , thus establishing the fully nonlinear solutions up to and including the tertiary level in the sequence of bifurcations approach to turbulence .",
    "we conclude this manuscript with a general discussion of our results and future work .",

    "the conductivity of temperature is predominant against inertia , the energy equation ( [ 5 ] ) decouples from the momentum equation ( [ 4 ] ) and the temperature variation becomes simply proportional to @xmath47 independently from @xmath41 .",

    "we further assume that the pressure gradient remains in the mean unchanged by the amplitude of the secondary flow and we show that there exists degeneracy that is invariably linked with the possibility of infinite streamwise length . in order to obtain the fully nonlinear equilibrium solution of these two - dimensional rolls",
