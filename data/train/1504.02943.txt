    "the discovery of the first extrasolar planet has led to the rapid development of many new methods for their detection and characterization .",
    "the best - characterized planets so far are those which were observed and analyzed by using multiple methods .",
    "thanks to the recent high accuracy instruments , polarimetry has become a promising technique for characterizing exoplanetary systems that can yield information inaccessible to other methods .",
    "particularly , @xcite showed that polarization variability which occurs due to scattering in the planetary atmosphere over the orbital period is capable to reveal the orbital period of the planet , inclination , eccentricity , orientation of the orbit in space as well as the nature of scattering particles in the planetary atmosphere .",
    "another interesting polarimetric effect is expected in exoplanetary systems when transits take place . by breaking the symmetry of the intensity integrated over the stellar disk , a transiting planet results in linear polarization of a partially eclipsed star .",
    "such an effect was first detected in the eclipsing binary algol @xcite .",
    "first estimates of the effect for transiting planets have been made only recently .",
    "@xcite numerically simulated the occultation polarization in exoplanetary systems of g dwarf stars , with planet sizes ranging from that of 1 to 2 times the size of jupiter .",
    "they also explored the cases of k - m - t dwarfs with a simplified limb polarization approximation and suggested that in favorable situations ground - based polarimetry should be able to detect earth - like planets orbiting these stars .",
    "@xcite using the same monte carlo technique , simulated the transit polarization for several objects with high planet - to - star radii ratio .",
    "for the tres-3 , wasp-4 and wasp-25 systems with g spectral type host stars the modelled solar limb polarization @xcite was chosen , while for one of the brightest transit exoplanetary system hd  189733 ( k spectral type ) pure scattering atmosphere approximation @xcite was applied .",
    "obviously , the latter approximation is too rough to predict the observational values of transit polarization .",
    "thus , @xcite , assuming solar limb polarization for hd  189733 , obtained the polarization that is different by almost two orders of magnitude as compared to @xcite , showing the importance of knowing the intrinsic stellar polarization .",
    "the center - to - limb variation of the linear polarization across the stellar disk originates from scattering opacity contributing to the total opacity in the atmosphere . by solving the radiative transfer equation for polarized light , @xcite calculated center - to - limb variations of the intensity and the linear polarization for stars of different spectral types accounting for various opacity sources .",
    "it was shown that low - gravity cool stars , while having weaker limb darkening , should exhibit significantly larger linear polarization in their continuum spectra as compared to solar - type stars . at the same time , for stars with the same effective temperature , the limb polarization is larger for the lower gravity stars , i.e. giants .    to detect a tiny polarization arizing from stellar symmetry breaking effect caused by a transiting exoplanet , a very sensitive polarimeter should be used .",
    "the most accurate polarimetric observations were made for the sun at a sensitivity level of parts in ten millions @xmath0 by @xcite .",
    "up to now , there are no more polarimeters which can get that high sensitivity level .",
    "nevertheless , there are several of them coming close .",
    "the zurich imaging polatimeter ( zimpol ) has achieved the @xmath1 relative sensitivity in solar spectropolarimetry @xcite but its absolute accuracy is unknown , zimpol is also one of the components for the sphere @xcite that can reach a polarimetric sensitivity about @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "planetpol can reach @xmath1 on bright target but its systematics is larger than the internal errors by at least factor 1.8 @xcite .",
    "the broad - band polarimeter dipol-2 is able to measure a polarized signal with a high precision of @xmath2 which appears photon limited on small telescopes .",
    "dipol-2 has the same statistic and systematic errors @xcite which was demonstrated by reproducing the measurements for algol by @xcite using a 60-cm telescope .    in this paper",
    ", we present our results of modeling the transit polarimetric effect for known transiting exoplanets which orbit spotted stars using the modelled center - to - limb variations of the intensity and linear polarization by @xcite . in section 2",
    "we describe our semi - analytical method for modeling flux and linear polarization curves during planetary transits . in section 3 the results of our calculations for 88 known transiting",
    "exoplanets are presented .",
    "several exoplanetary systems that have grazing and near - grazing transiting planets are studied in section 4 . as a spot on the star can produce the polarimetric signal due to the same symmetry breaking effect , we investigated it in the section 5 .",
    "finally , we present a summary of this paper in section 6 .",
    "for a given set of parameters describing configuration of the planetary system , the residual normalized stellar flux when the star is blocked by the planet can be expressed as ,    @xmath3    where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the planetary and stellar radii , respectively , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are polar coordinates of a stellar disk , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the polar coordinates of the center of the planet , @xmath10 is the stellar limb darkening .    the normalized stokes parameters are    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the center - to - limb variation of the linear polarization of the star . here",
    "q ( north - south ) and u ( 45 @xmath13 counterclockwise to q ) are defined as positive .    as seen from eq .",
    "[ eq : flux ] and eq .",
    "2(a , b ) , to calculate the flux and two normalized stokes parameters q and u during the transit , the center - to - limb variations of the intensity @xmath10 and the linear polarization @xmath12 should be known .",
    "we calculate the center - to - limb variation of intensity ( clvi ) and linear polarization ( clvp ) in the continuum spectra for the grid of phoenix models @xcite within the range of effective temperatures from 3500k to 6000k and for gravity @xmath14 . assuming no magnetic field present",
    ", we solved the radiative transfer equations for polarized light iteratively considering plane - parallel model atmosphere and various opacities .",
    "the method of radiative transfer equations and opacity contributions calculation are described in @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we present some examples of intensity ( fig .",
    "[ fig1],a ) and polarization variation ( fig .",
    "[ fig1],b ) depending on the position on the stellar disk @xmath15 ( clvi and clvp ) for models with effective temperatures of 5800k , 5000k , 4500k , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath18 was chosen to be 4.5 since most of the known transiting exoplanetary hosts have @xmath19 in the range between 4.3 to 4.7 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the clvp and clvi strongly depend on the value of @xmath18 . using the look - up tables we interpolate them to get the clvi and the clvp for the host star of particular effective temperature and surface gravity .      in the previous studies @xcite the method of @xcite to model the polarization effects in transiting exoplanet systems was employed .",
    "while being simple , this monte carlo based approach is flexible and can be easily modified to account for different cases such as spots or stellar oblateness . however , since considered polarimetric effects are often small one needs to use a huge number of photon packets emitted from randomly chosen locations on a host star in order to obtain smooth stokes parameter variation curves in the output .",
    "this makes the method time - consuming and inapplicable for solving the inverse problem .",
    "current methods for transit light curve modeling ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are heavily based on the analytical models from @xcite .",
    "they are much faster than one- or two - dimensional numerical integration methods . however , analytical models require analytical functions for limb - darkening and , in our case , for polarization as well .",
    "while we tried different functions to fit calculated limb - darkening and polarization variations , none were successful enough for our task , resulting in discernible artifacts , especially , on the stokes parameters variation curves .",
    "thus , we interpolated limb - darkening and polarization from the look - up tables that were calculated with steps by @xmath20 equal or better than 0.01 @xcite and numerically integrated over the stellar surface .    in our method",
    "we use polar grid pixelization as shown in figure [ fig2]a .",
    "the polar coordinate system corresponds to the stellar disk sky projection and is centered on the disk center .",
    "we have tested different grids , but ended up with a uniform grid in both radial and angular coordinates .",
    "all distances and sizes are normalized to the host star s radius .",
    "after initializing the grid we pre - calculate for each surface pixel the area , the flux and stokes polarization parameters from our limb - darkening and polarization tables using 3d linear interpolation in effective temperature , gravity and wavelength .",
    "the basic idea of modeling is to exclude from the integration those pixels that are covered by the passing opaque planet .",
    "the finite size pixelization requires a special treatment for partially covered pixels .",
    "since enlargement of the grid dimensions worsen the computational speed , for such pixels we employ subdivision into smaller sectors by polar angle ( see fig . [ fig2]a ) .",
    "we assign the same pre - calculated flux and the polarization for the partially covered pixels scaled by the covered - to - open area ratio .",
    "the calculation of the covered subpixel area is made with trapezoids .    after a number of tests we have chosen 200x200 pixel grid with 100 subpixel division .",
    "our comparison with the @xcite method shows a significant gain in performance without loss of accuracy .",
    "we think that with an appropriate minimization algorithm our method could be used for solving the inverse problem to obtain different system parameters using polarization data in addition to lightcurves .",
    "each transit flux and polarization curves were calculated for 200 points across the event to allow the maximum polarization to be well seen",
    ". however , to simulate more realistic observations , we averaged the stokes parameters assuming that we can get only 10 for each q and u measurements per transit , because the exposure time can not be very small , as we need to integrate longer to achieve a required sensitivity .",
    "we have realized both circular and elliptical orbital motion in the program .",
    "the later involves kepler s equation solution as described in @xcite .",
    "since the transit usually lasts for only a few hours , which is short compared to the orbital period , orbital ellipticity does not change the results significantly .",
    "however , the orientation of the orbit measured by longitude of the ascending node @xmath21 expectedly alters the curves for q and u stokes parameters ( see below ) . as for most exoplanetary systems",
    "the @xmath21 is not known , we assume it equal to @xmath22 .    along with the planet transit we have accounted in our code for spots and binary system modeling ( with possibility to add spots on both stars ) .",
    "the core integration algorithm is the same as described above .",
    "spots are considered under the following simple assumptions : they have circular boundary with no penumbra , show no temporal size and position changes , and there is no differential rotation of the star . according to the assigned temperature for each spot a separate grid of flux and polarization pixel values",
    "is pre - calculated for spots . for partially covered pixels",
    "we account for both covering by planet and spot . for the host star we set the axis of rotation orientation following",
    "the rossiter - mclaughlin effect conventions shown in figure [ fig2]b ( for details , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the sections below we analyze the modeling results with our method of different test cases and real exoplanet systems .",
    "the main advantage of polarimetry is that we have two parameters ( stokes q and u ) that are varying and can change their sign during the transit , providing more information than photometry , which measures only one parameter  the relative flux .",
    "measuring variations of normalized stokes @xmath23 and @xmath24 , one can also get the longitude of the ascending node @xmath21 in addition to the inclination angle , that can be determined from photometric observations .",
    "in addition to the planetary parameters , polarimetry yields information about the host star as well . particularly , it can give the center - to - limb variation of the polarization , which could be used for testing the stellar models .",
    "there are more than 600 transiting exoplanetary systems with various parameters known to date . based on those parameters that contribute to the transit polarization",
    ", we have formulated a few criteria for larger polarization and selected promising exoplanets mostly using the catalog from the extrasolar planets encyclopaedia ( _ http://exoplanet.eu _ ) and for some cases that did not have enough information we use additional exoplanets orbit database ( _ http://exoplanets.org_ ) . in cooler stellar atmosphere a contribution to the opacity from rayleigh scattering increases that gives rise to polarization at the stellar limb @xcite .",
    "here we constrained the effective temperature of the host stars to be in the range between 3500k and 6000k .",
    "another important parameter that leads to larger polarization during transit is the planet - to - star radii ratio , which was set to be larger than 0.1 . according to these criteria",
    ", we obtained a sample of 88 transiting exoplanets presented in table [ tbl-1 ] . for each system , we list the planet - to - star radii ratio ( @xmath25 ) , the effective temperature @xmath26 , the surface gravity @xmath18 , the orbit inclination angle @xmath27 , the apparent magnitude in v filter , and the maximum continuum polarization degree @xmath28 for light curves with 10 points at wavelengths @xmath29 and @xmath30 predicted by our models .",
    "we list @xmath28 instead of @xmath31 and @xmath32 because the positional angle of the orbit @xmath21 is not known in most cases .",
    "it can be determined from polarization measurements taken during the entire orbit @xcite . since the intrinsic polarization of stars is the largest at the limb ,",
    "the maximum polarization during the transit occurs when the planet eclipses the edge of the stellar disk .",
    "the shape of the transit curves depend on the orbital parameters .",

    "spots can also provide the information about the stellar rotation axis spatial orientation , i.e. , stellar obliquity , usually expressed by a sky - projected spin - orbit misalignment @xmath58 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this technique also relies upon detection of consecutive starspot - crossing events .",
    "a superposition of a planetary transit and starspots create a complex picture of linear polarization signal variations .",
    "importantly , starspots can be revealed with transit polarimetry even in the absence of spot crossing events , thus giving a more complete account of stellar activity and potentially complementing the aforementioned techniques .",
    "different spot locations contribute in different way to integral polarized light . evidently , the polarization degree due to a near - limb spot is the highest , and at other spot locations its contribution will be less significant .",

    "in addition , transit polarimetry can characterize the host star as well , including center - to - limb variation of the polarization that can be used for testing stellar models .",
    "polarimetry allows to distinguish between the grazing and near - grazing planetary transit .",
    "our simulations showed that there is a qualitative difference in the polarization degree curves for these two cases , while photometric curves are nearly the same in shape .",
    "moreover , for a near - grazing exoplanetary transit , the polarization degree will be almost constant during the transit .",
    "this allows to average the polarimetric signal from almost entire transit for a better sensitivity . in our sample",
    ", we found one grazing system wasp-67 , which has maximum polarization degree above the chosen sensitivity limit of @xmath64 .",
    "based on the existing studies of stellar activity , we analysed the system configurations of hd  189733 and kepler-63 and simulated the flux and linear polarization variations with starspots , including spot - crossing events .",
    "our results indicated that starspots can contribute significantly to the polarization , by causing vertical offsets in the curves and , in particular , changing the shape of the polarization degree variation even if the spot is not crossed by the planet , while remaining hardly detectable in the relative flux light curves .",
    "the important finding is that polarization parameters are sensitive to spot sizes , positions and reveal the stellar rotation period equally with and without spot - crossing effect .",
