    ". notice that for any compact embedded manifold of class @xmath25 this repulsive potential @xmath4 is finite . for two - dimensional surfaces in @xmath26 , i.e. @xmath27 , @xmath28 , banavar et al .",
    "@xcite suggested , in fact , the use of such tangent - point functions to construct self - interaction energies with non - singular integrands that do not require any sort of ad hoc regularization , in contrast to standard repulsive potentials .",
    "the latter would penalize any two surface points that are close in euclidean distance , no matter whether these points are adjacent on the surface ( leading to singularities ) or belong to different sheets of the same surface .",
    "our aim here is to show that for the infinite range of exponents @xmath5 finiteness of @xmath0 has three sorts of consequences for any admissible set @xmath29 : measure - theoretic , topological , and analytical . to see them in a proper perspective ,",
    "let us give a plain description of the surfaces we work with .",
    "our class @xmath10 consists of @xmath1-dimensional sets @xmath30 with finite measure @xmath31 on which we impose ( 1 ) a certain degree of flatness in the neighbourhood of many ( but a priori not all ! ) points of @xmath2 , and ( 2 ) some degree of connectivity . a priori , we allow for various self  intersections of @xmath2 , and for singularities along low dimensional subsets . for the purposes of this introduction ,",
    "however , it is enough to keep in mind the following examples of admissible surfaces ( more general examples are presented in section [ sec:2.3 ] ) :    1 .",
    "if @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is arbitrary and all @xmath34 are compact , closed , embedded @xmath1-dimensional submanifolds of class @xmath6 such that @xmath35 whenever @xmath36 , then @xmath37 is admissible ; 2 .",
    "if @xmath37 is as above , then @xmath38 is admissible whenever @xmath39 is a bilipschitz homeomorphism of @xmath11 .",
    "the dimension @xmath1 and the codimension @xmath40 of @xmath2 in @xmath11 are fixed throughout the paper but otherwise arbitrary .",
    "the reader may adopt for now the temporary definition @xmath41    it is easy to see that @xmath42 is a critical exponent here : for @xmath43 the energy @xmath0 is scale invariant , and for each @xmath44 a surface @xmath2 with a conical singularity at one point must have @xmath45 .",
    "we prove in this paper that for @xmath46 all kinds of singularities are excluded .",
    "in fact , upper bounds for @xmath0 lead to three kinds of effects .",
    "firstly , measure - theoretic effects : the measure of @xmath2 contained in a ball or radius @xmath47 is comparable to @xmath48 on small scales that depend solely on the energy .",
    "secondly topological effects : an admissible surface @xmath2 with finite @xmath4-energy has no self - intersections , it must be an embedded manifold , and finally , far - reaching analytical consequences : we have precise @xmath8 bounds for the charts in an atlas of @xmath2 .",
    "-energy for all @xmath49 ) . ]",
    "let us first state the results precisely and then comment on the proofs and discuss the relations of this paper to existing research .",
    "keep in mind , though , that all results stated in the introduction will be proved for a more general class @xmath50 of admissible sets much larger than the preliminary class @xmath10 defined above ; see section [ sec:2.3 ] .",
    "to get a first impression of other admissible sets have a look at figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "[ thm : uar ] assume that @xmath29 is an admissible @xmath1-dimensional surface in @xmath11 with @xmath51 , @xmath5 .",
    "there exists a constant @xmath52 , depending _ only _ on @xmath53 and @xmath1 , such that @xmath54 for all @xmath55 and all radii @xmath56 [ conj1 ] ( here , and throughout the paper , @xmath57 denotes the closed ball of radius @xmath58 centered at @xmath16 . )    in other words : if @xmath12 has finite energy for some @xmath5 , then up to the length scale given by @xmath59  which depends _ only _ on the energy bound @xmath60 and the parameters @xmath61 , but _ not _ on @xmath2 itself  isolated _ thin fingers _ , narrow tubes , and the likecannot form on @xmath2 .",
    "the measure of the portion of @xmath2 inside the ball @xmath62 is at least as large as half of the measure of the @xmath1-dimensional equatorial cross - section of @xmath62 .",
    "a similar lower estimate on the ahlfors regularity was proven by l. simon for smooth two - dimensional surfaces with finite willmore energy ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 1.3 ) ; see also the work of p. topping @xcite which even contains _ sharp _ lower bounds for the sum of local @xmath63-norm of the classic mean curvature and the area of the surface in a small ball .",
    "mean curvature at a particular point @xmath16 on a smooth surface in @xmath26 may be viewed as the arithmetic mean of minimal and maximal normal curvature at @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath64 , on the other hand , is a two - point function taking non - local interactions into account as well , but if one looks at the coalescent limits @xmath65 one obtains absolute values of intermediate normal curvatures at @xmath16 depending on the direction of approach as @xmath20 tends to @xmath16 ( cf .",
    "* section 3.2 ) ) .",
    "so , the local portion of our energy @xmath4 near @xmath16 may be regarded as another kind of averaging normal curvatures at @xmath16 , leading to density estimates as does the willmore functional .",

    "implies that @xmath2 must be a submanifold of class @xmath79 .",
    "since @xmath12 might , at least a priori , have transversal self  intersections , we do not have reifenberg flatness here , and a quick direct use of the results of @xcite is impossible . however , we are able to use the energy estimates and the information given by theorem  [ thm : betas ] iteratively . extending the ideas from our earlier work ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  5 ) devoted to surfaces in @xmath26 , we prove here that at every point @xmath14 there exists the classic tangent plane @xmath80 , and that the oscillation of tangent planes along @xmath2 satisfies uniform hlder estimates .",
    "this implies that each @xmath29 with @xmath81 must be an embedded @xmath1-dimensional manifold of class @xmath79 .",
    "later on , working with graph patches of @xmath2 , we use slicing techniques and a bootstrap reasoning to improve and sharpen this information .",

    "it is clear that finiteness of @xmath4 does not lead to @xmath96 regularity : consider a rotational cylinder closed with two hemispherical caps as an admissible surface @xmath2 of class @xmath25 but not in @xmath96 . for this particular surface inequality",
    "is qualitatively optimal and , due to the factor @xmath97 and boundedness of @xmath98 , yields in fact _ lipschitz _ estimates for the gradient of local graph representations of @xmath2 .",
    "please note two more things .",
    "first , the exponent @xmath99 is computed according to the recipe used in the classic sobolev ",
    "morrey imbedding theorem in the supercritical case .",
    "here , the dimension of the domain of integration , i.e. of @xmath100 , equals @xmath101 .",
    "we have @xmath102 as @xmath103 ; for two - dimensional surfaces , the limiting case @xmath104 has been treated earlier in our papers @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "second , what we have learnt about @xmath2 is not limited to embeddedness and purely qualitative @xmath8 estimates .",
    "it is clear that the bounds given by theorem  [ thm : bootstrap ] are uniform in any class of surfaces with uniformly bounded energy @xmath4 . in other words ,",
    "if @xmath105 satisfies @xmath106 then we can find two constants @xmath107 , depending only on @xmath108 and @xmath71 , such that each @xmath109 , where @xmath110 and @xmath111 , is obtained by a rigid motion of @xmath11 from a graph of a function @xmath112 which satisfies the uniform estimate @xmath113 , no matter how @xmath110 and @xmath111 have been chosen .",
    "thus , a uniform upper bound on @xmath4 allows us to fix a uniform size of charts for all @xmath114 , and forces the equicontinuity of gradients of local graph representations of the surfaces @xmath115 . in a forthcoming paper @xcite",
    "we show how to use this idea to obtain finiteness theorems for classes of @xmath116 embedded manifolds @xmath115 in @xmath11 satisfying a volume constraint and a uniform energy bound .",
    "we do not know what happens in the critical case @xmath117 .",
    "let us mention here one plausible conjecture that we can not prove at this stage .",
    "every immersed @xmath1-dimensional @xmath6-manifold in @xmath118 with finite @xmath119-energy is embedded .",
    "another , probably more difficult , question that we can not handle at present is the following : how regular are the minimizers of @xmath4 ( say , with upper bounds for the total measure , to prevent the decrease of energy caused by rescaling ) in isotopy classes of @xmath6 embedded manifolds ? are they @xmath25 ( this is optimal for _ ideal links _",
    "@xcite  corresponding to the case @xmath104 in dimensions @xmath27 and @xmath120  where contact phenomena are present ) ? or maybe @xmath121 , as minimizers of a mbius invariant knot energy in @xcite , @xcite ; see also @xcite , @xcite ?",
    "in addition , s. blatt @xcite characterized all curves with finite mbius energy as embeddings in certain sobolev - slobodecki classes ; such a _ characterization _ of finite energy submanifolds for the tangent - point energy @xmath4 is presently not known .",
    "our interest in this topic has been triggered by several factors .",
    "they include manifold applications of menger curvature in harmonic analysis and geometric measure theory ( see e.g. the survey articles of p. mattila @xcite , @xcite , g. david @xcite and x. tolsa @xcite , and the literature cited therein , including j.c .",
    "lger @xcite and the relation between @xmath122-rectifiability and @xmath63-integrability of menger curvature ) .",
    "there are also works of different origin , investigating another geometric concept , the so - called global curvature introduced by gonzalez and maddocks @xcite .",
    "the second author of the present paper took part in laying out the strict mathematical foundations for global curvature of rectifiable loops and its variational applications to elastic curves and rods with positive thickness ; see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "part of this work , in turn , has been a starting point for our subsequent joint research devoted to various energies that , roughly speaking , interpolate between global curvature and menger curvature .",
    "finiteness of these energies ; see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , analogously to the case that we consider here , leads to an increase of regularity , to compactness effects , and yields a tool to control the amount of bending of non - smooth objects in purely geometric terms .",
    "of the present paper , along with a few knot - theoretic applications of @xmath4 for curves . ] the novelty in the present paper is that we work in full generality , overcoming the difficulty that both the dimension and the codimension may be arbitrary . in an ongoing research",
    "@xcite s. kolasiski obtains analogues of our results for basically the same admissible class of surfaces that we consider here , but for a different integral energy , defined as an @xmath123-fold integral ( with respect to @xmath13 ) over the set of all simplices with vertices on @xmath2 , directly extending our results in @xcite to surfaces of arbitrary dimension and codimension .",
    "closely related research includes also g. lerman and j.t .",
    "whitehouse @xcite , @xcite , who investigate a number of ingenious high - dimensional curvatures of menger type and obtain rectifiability criteria for @xmath58-dimensional subsets of hilbert spaces .",
    "last but not least , the deep and classic paper of w. allard @xcite sets forth a regularity theory for @xmath124-dimensional varifolds whose first variation ( roughly : the distributional counterpart of mean curvature ) is in @xmath125 for some @xmath126 .",
    "our regularity results bear some resemblance to his theorem 8.1 .",
    "there are many differences , though , that remain to be fully understood .",
    "it is clear that without some extra topological assumptions on @xmath2 finiteness of can not lead to the conclusion that @xmath2 is locally ( on a scale depending only on the energy ! ) homeomorphic to a disc ; one could punch an arbitrary number of ` holes ' in a smooth surface and this would just decrease the energy we work with . in allard",
    "s case , once we fix a ball where appropriate density estimates hold and the weight @xmath127 of the varifold @xmath128 is close to the hausdorff measure of a disk , then the ` lack of holes ' is built into his assumption on the first variation @xmath129 of @xmath128 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath4  as a non - local energy in contrast to the locally defined distributional mean curvature  averages over all global tangent - point interactions , which leads to self - avoidance and control over topology of the given surface .",
    "admissible sets with finite @xmath4-energy are differentiable manifolds , which allard s result can not guarantee for varifolds with distributional mean curvature in @xmath125 , @xmath130 : there is a remaining ( small ) singular set , such that there is no control on the topology of the support of the varifold measure .",
    "to possibly bridge the apparent gap between allard s work and our results we should note that versions of @xmath4 can be defined for general @xmath1-dimensional varifolds @xmath128 , via double integrals : the integrand @xmath98 can be treated as a function on _ points and planes_. it is an intriguing question whether finiteness of such integrals for some @xmath71 s lead to rectifiability criteria or to an improved regularity in the case of varifolds .",
    "let us now informally sketch the main thread of our reasoning , and describe the organization of the paper in more detail .",
    "we want to exclude self intersections and to have a quantitative description of flatness ; for this , theorem  [ thm : betas ] would be a good starting point . the main idea behind its proof is pretty straightforward : if the @xmath66-numbers were too large , i.e. if @xmath55 but @xmath131 were not confined to a narrow tube @xmath132 around some affine @xmath1-plane @xmath133 , then , a simple argument shows that we would have two much smaller balls @xmath134 , say with @xmath135 such that for all @xmath136 and a nonzero proportion of @xmath137 the distance @xmath138 would be comparable to @xmath139 .",
    "this yields @xmath140 , and a lower bound for the energy follows easily , leading to a contradiction , _ if _ the @xmath141 and the bound for the @xmath66 s are chosen in a suitable way which happens to be precisely the balance condition .",
    "there is only one serious catch here : in order to make the resulting estimate uniform , and to be able to iterate it later on , we must guarantee that @xmath142 with some _ absolute _ constant @xmath143 .",
    "and we want _ both _ @xmath144 and @xmath143 independent of a particular @xmath2 .    for this",
    ", we need theorem  [ thm : uar ] which serves as the backbone for all the later constructions and estimates of the paper .",
    "the overall idea here is somewhat similar to an analogous result in our work @xcite on menger curvature for surfaces in @xmath26 .",
    "the main difference , however , leading to crucial difficulties , is that the _ codimension _ of @xmath2 may be arbitrary .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm : uar ] has two stages .",
    "first , for a fixed generic point @xmath55 and all radii @xmath47 below a stopping distance @xmath145 , we control the size of projections of @xmath146 onto some @xmath1-plane @xmath147 ( which may vary as @xmath47 varies ) . here , topology comes into play . to grasp the essence of our idea , it is convenient to think of @xmath148 as in example ( i ) at the beginning of the introduction . for @xmath149 and for infinitesimally small radii @xmath47",
    "we start with the tangent planes @xmath150 , and note that small @xmath151-spheres that are perpendicular to @xmath152 are nontrivially linked with @xmath153 .",
    "then , for a sequence of growing radii @xmath154 , we rotate @xmath78 if necessary by a controlled angle to a new position @xmath155 in order to keep the projections large . at the same time , we construct a growing connected _ excluded region _",
    "@xmath156 which does not contain any point of @xmath2 in its interior .",
    "the size of the projections is controlled via a topological argument , involving the homotopy invariance of the linking number mod 2 of submanifolds .",
    "the construction stops at some stopping distance @xmath157 , and yields another point @xmath158 with @xmath159 and two smaller balls @xmath160 , @xmath161 , where @xmath162 is an explicit absolute constant , such that @xmath163 for all @xmath164 and a significant proportion of @xmath165 . in the second stage we use the energy bounds to show that @xmath166 is positive and satisfies @xmath167 , where @xmath59 is the uniform constant given in theorem  [ thm : uar ] .",
    "the details of that part are given in section [ sec:4 ] ; see lemma  [ 1/r - est ] , lemma  [ mainlemma ] and their corollaries .",
    "sections [ sec:2 ] and [ sec:3 ] contain all the necessary prerequisites and are included for the sake of completeness . in section  [ sec:2 ]",
    "we gather elementary estimates of angles between planes spanned by nearby almost orthogonal bases , and introduce the class of admissible sets whose definition is designed so that the above sketchy idea can be made precise . in section  [ sec:3 ] we explain how the linking number mod 2 can be used for elements of @xmath10 , providing specific statements ( and short proofs ) for sake of further reference .",
    "once theorem  [ thm : uar ] is proved , we use the hausdorff convergence of excluded regions defined for generic points @xmath55 to obtain a corollary which , roughly speaking , ascertains that for _ every _ @xmath14 and @xmath168 there is some plane @xmath169 such that @xmath146 has large projection onto @xmath170 and is contained either in @xmath171 ( where , a priori , at this stage of the reasoning , @xmath2 might behave in a pretty wild way ) or in a narrow tubular region @xmath172 , for some specific constant @xmath173 .",
    "a use of energy bounds yields now theorem  [ thm : betas ] , and an iterative argument implies that in fact @xmath2 must locally be a @xmath79 graph .",
    "all this is done in section  [ sec:5 ] .",
    "embeddedness of @xmath2 is established here , too .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec:6 ] , we prove theorem  [ thm : bootstrap ] and sharpen the hlder bounds . to this end , we show that if @xmath174 is a graph of @xmath175 , then @xmath176 satisfies an improved estimate , @xmath177 where @xmath178 stands for the supremum of oscillations of @xmath176 over all possible balls of radius @xmath179 , and @xmath60 is the portion of energy coming from some ball containing @xmath180 .",
    "the point is that holds for some @xmath181 , so that for @xmath175 the first term of the right hand side can be viewed as an unimportant , small scale perturbation .",
    "the main idea behind is that when the integral average of @xmath182 is bounded by @xmath183 , then there are numerous points @xmath184 in small balls around the @xmath185 , @xmath186 , where @xmath187 .",
    "a geometric argument implies that for such points @xmath188 can be controlled by the second term in the right hand side of , and a routine iterative reasoning , with a certain morrey ",
