    "the galactic center ( gc ) , in particular the interstellar material in the immediate vicinity ( @xmath16  pc ) of the central black hole , represents a unique environment for our understanding of galactic nuclei and galaxy evolution . at a distance @xmath17  kpc @xcite , the nucleus of our galaxy is a few hundred times closer than the nearest active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , thus allowing high spatial resolution studies .",
    "the distribution of gas and dust toward the gc @xcite consists of a central cavity of radius @xmath01.5pc containing warm dust and gas heated and ionized by the central cluster of massive stars orbiting close to the black hole ( sgra@xmath2  radio source position ) .",

    "the molecular gas toward the central cavity has been less studied , first because high angular resolution is required to separate the different components and also because column densities are inevitably lower and emission lines are intrinsically weak .",
    "nevertheless , the detection of co ro - vibrational lines in absorption @xcite and of broad nh@xmath7  ( 6,6 ) emission lines close to sgra@xmath2  @xcite suggests that _ hot _ molecular gas must exist interior to the cnd .",
    "owing to the lower dust extinction at far - ir wavelengths and because of the strong emission from the interstellar component related to agn and star formation activity , the relevance of far - ir spectroscopy to characterize extragalactic nuclei has notably increased ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",

    "alternatively , @xmath72 can reflect much higher gas temperatures if the density is significantly lower than the critical density for collisional excitation ( @xmath73@xmath13 for the observed high-@xmath4 lines ) .",

    "the gas temperature is well constrained and @xmath85@xmath2610@xmath86k reproduces the observed co rotational ladder ( also the lines detected by pacs alone ) independently of the assumed @xmath37(co ) .",
    "even lower densities ( for less realistic higher @xmath37(co ) columns ) can also reproduce the co ladder .",
    "in addition to the isothermal solution , multiple gas temperature components can also explain a co rotational diagram with positive curvature .",

    "in this section we discuss the possible heating mechanisms of the _ hot _ molecular gas toward the central parsec . in order to evaluate the role of uv  radiation in the heating and excitation of co , we used an updated version of the _ meudon _ pdr code @xcite to compute synthetic co rotational diagrams for the integrated co emission from @xmath95=0 to 10 .",
    "we adopted @xmath96=10@xmath97 @xcite and different gas densities .",
    "our photochemical model includes selective photodissociation of co - isotopologues and @xmath5c fractionation . for the considered range of densities , selective",

    "deeper inside , as the gas temperature decreases , @xmath5c isotope exchange starts to be important and the @xmath3co/@xmath5co column density ratio can be lower than the @xmath3c/@xmath5c ratio .",

    ", we see that low - density pdrs ( @xmath69@xmath9810@xmath99@xmath13 ) are not able to reproduce the high-@xmath4 co emission and an extra heating / excitation source is needed .",
    "in addition to photoelectric heating , denser pdrs ( @xmath69@xmath2610@xmath100@xmath13 ) heat larger columns of molecular gas ( to t@xmath101@xmath010@xmath102k ) by vibrational heating from collisional deexcitation of uv - pumped h@xmath6 molecules .",
    "therefore , in addition to an extended low - density medium , a small filling factor ensemble of irradiated dense clumps / clouds could be responsible of the high-@xmath4 co emission @xcite .",
    "our best combined pdr models , however , do not provide an entirely satisfactory fit of the co  rotational ladder .",
    "this result is consistent with the lack of good high - density fits to the high-@xmath4 co lines ( see previous the section ) and suggests that uv  radiation alone can not heat the _ hot _ molecular gas .",

    "<S> the spectrum toward sgra@xmath2  is dominated by strong [ oiii ] , [ oi ] , [ cii ] , [ niii ] , [ nii ] , and [ ci ] fine structure lines ( in decreasing order of luminosity ) arising in gas irradiated by uv - photons from the central stellar cluster . </S>",

    "<S> the _ hot _ co  component ( either the bulk of the co column or just a small fraction depending on the above scenario ) results from a combination of uv-  and shock - driven heating . if irradiated dense clumps / clouds do not exist , shocks likely dominate the heating of the @xmath15 molecular gas . </S>",
