    "dome a has its disadvantages as well .",
    "the long day interrupts the longer - term observations necessary for tracking supernova flux evolution .",
    "the polar latitude limits the area of sky accessible by a telescope .",
    "auroral activity produces high uv to @xmath7 band sky emission with non - uniform spatial structure .",
    "there are technical hurdles as well , including the remoteness of the site , power , and the transfer of data out of the site , avoiding mirror condensation , and achieving the excellent seeing with the observatory structures .",
    "china is moving forward with developing the site @xcite .",
    "in the ( austral ) summer of 2008 - 2009 a summer station was constructed . in the next few years",
    ", the three 0.5-m antarctic schmidt telescopes ( ast3 ) will be installed .",
    "a 1-m class pathfinder is planned to characterize the site and develop the necessary technical knowhow ; the intent is to eventually build a 4 - 10 m - class telescope .    in this paper , we explore possible supernova surveys that can be performed by these telescopes . in ",

    "a nearby sample is essential when using type ia supernovae as distance indicators to measure the expansion history of the universe @xcite .",
    "the low - redshift anchor has strong leverage in fits of cosmological parameters .",
    "in addition , the accessibility of accurate and precise photometric and spectroscopic measurements of these high flux objects makes them an important set with which to gain a quantitative understanding of the supernova luminosity function and its sub - populations .",
    "there are currently relatively few discovered and followed supernovae in the nearby hubble flow at @xmath80.1 as compared to higher redshifts , and there are several programs designed to bolster their numbers .",
    "the nearby supernova factory @xcite , for example , targets the range @xmath9 as a sweet spot @xcite where peculiar velocities are relatively small compared to the cosmological redshift and the deviation from the linear hubble law is sensitive to the current deceleration parameter @xmath10 but not to individual cosmological components . at the current level of systematics , the hubble diagram would be anchored satisfactorily by the 180 well - observed nearby supernovae we take to exist by 2011 .",
    "thus the main strength of the dome a low - redshift supernovae is its ability to study the supernova properties themselves fulfilling the important role of mapping out systematic effects with a large sample .",
    "this includes finding subpopulations that may be relatively rare today though more common at higher redshifts .",
    "if we seek to distinguish subclasses at the 0.02 mag level in absolute magnitude , in the presence of an intrinsic scatter of 0.15 mag , this statistically requires 50 supernovae . to detect a subclass down to 10% of the total population",
    "we would need a full set of 500 supernovae in that redshift range .",
    "these two requirements of low enough redshift to allow thorough observation and high enough numbers to allow in - depth characterization drive the survey design . for the purposes of this note",

    "<S> dome a , the highest plateau in antarctica , is being developed as a site for an astronomical observatory . </S>",
    "<S> the planned telescopes and instrumentation and the unique site characteristics are conducive toward type ia supernova surveys for cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> a self - contained search and survey over five years can yield a spectro - photometric time series of @xmath01000 @xmath1 supernovae . these can serve to anchor the hubble diagram and quantify the relationship between luminosities and heterogeneities within the type ia supernova class , reducing systematics . </S>",
    "<S> larger aperture ( @xmath24-m ) telescopes are capable of discovering supernovae shortly after explosion out to @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> these can be fed to space telescopes , and can isolate systematics and extend the redshift range over which we measure the expansion history of the universe .    supernova : type ia , dome a , surveys , cosmology </S>"
