    "one of the first steps in any research work is to group objects with common properties ( e.g. shape , weight , color , ... ) .",
    "this taxonomy is a powerful tool in order to understand the physics behind the formation and evolution of the studied objects .",
    "probably the most popular classification of galaxies is based on the shapes or morphologies ( started with * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this first order classification has survived over time since the different morphological classes of galaxies have also different physical properties and probably different evolutionary tracks . in general ,",
    "galaxies can be divided into two main classes : early - types ( hereafter et ) and late - types ( hereafter lt ) .",
    "ets include elliptical and lenticular galaxies , while lts include spirals and irregular galaxies .",
    "ets appear to be a family of objects showing old stellar populations , spheroidal - like dynamical properties and a small fraction of cold gas whereas lts are more gas - rich objects , present younger stellar populations , and are mainly rotation supported .",
    "visual inspection is the traditional way to classify galaxies . by definition , it is subjective and not reproducible , but for bright and extended objects there is a general good agreement between different observers .",
    "they are however time consuming . in the past ,",
    "galaxy samples contained from dozens up to hundreds of galaxies while present galaxy surveys have up to millions of galaxies .",
    "this makes impossible to give detailed morphological classifications unless a large amount of classifiers are involved ( see the galaxy zoo project ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    over the past years",
    ", different automated methods of morphological classification of galaxies have been developed .",
    "automated classifications resolve the two main problems raised above .",
    "they provide indeed reproducible information , and the errors can be fully understood by using extensive simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , modern galaxy classification algorithms are able to classify large samples of galaxies in a reasonable amount time .",
    "we usually distinguish between three broad groups of automated galaxy classifications : parametric based on galaxy physical parameters , non - parametric , and parametric based on mathematical parameters .",
    "parametric classifications use parametric models in order to reproduce some galaxy measurements .",
    "one of the most popular parametric methods based on galaxy physical parameters classifies galaxies according to some properties of their structural parameters obtained by fitting the surface brightness ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the other side , non - parametric galaxy classifications are based on the measurements of a set of galaxy parameters that correlate with the morphological types .",
    "these methods have the advantage that they assume non - parametric models and can hence classify regular and irregular objects .",
    "several galaxy parameters have been used to discriminate between different morphological types , i.e colours ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , spectral properties ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or light distribution ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "current works are led to more complex fitting models , using orthonormal mathematical bases to decompose the galaxies , and then correlating the physical properties of the objects with the coefficients of the decomposition by means of a principal component analysis .",
    "this is the case of the shapelets @xcite , or future works with the sersiclets @xcite , and the chefs @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of these latter methods with regard to the former is their flexibility and reliability to reproduce every feature in the galaxies , and then to efficiently model every kind of morphology , including irregular objects .",
    "moreover , they do not need any a priori knowledge and they do not impose any profile to fit the galaxies .",
    "however , these mathematical models are computationally more expensive and the parameters of the final decomposition do not provide any physical information .",
    "alh data will be used for further development of the chefs method ( jimnez et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "galsvm @xcite provides a generalization of the non - parametric classifications by using an unlimited number of dimensions and providing a probabilistic output following a bayesian approach ( see also @xcite for a similar approach ) .",
    "the algorithm has been shown to be specially useful when dealing with low - resolution and high - redshift data@xcite and has been successfully applied to several large samples at low and high redshift @xcite , including the cosmological evolution survey ( cosmos ; * ? ? ? * ) and sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) samples .",
    "+ in this paper we present the morphological classification of a large sample of galaxies from the advanced large homogeneous area medium band redshift astronomical , alhambra survey ( hereafter alh ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , located at different redshifts . taking into account the resolution of alh data ( @xmath01arcsec ) and all the advantages of galsvm code mentioned above , we used this method for our morphological classification .",
    "alh survey imaged @xmath04deg@xmath1 of the sky through 23 optical and near - infrared ( nir ) filters .",
    "the large number of filters provide accurate photometric redshifts by fitting the spectral energy distributions ( hereafter sed ) of the galaxies for about one million sources .",

    "unless otherwise specified , all magnitudes are given in the ab system @xcite .",
    "the alhambra observations were carried out at the calar alto german - spanish astronomical center ( caha ) , under the spanish guaranteed time of 110 nights .",
    "eight fields were observed in the northern hemisphere sky , having a seeing lower than 1.6arcsec ( ranging mainly between 0.8 and 1.2arcsec ) . all fields ( except alh-1 ) have the multiwavelength information available from other ( deep ) extragalactic surveys ( see @xcite and table  [ tab_alhambra_obs ] ) .",
    "each alh detection was observed in 23 bands , with 20 optical and three standard @xmath2 nir filters .",
    "optical range is covered in a continuous way from 340 nm to 970 nm , with non - overlapping and equal 30 nm width medium bands @xcite .",
    "this set of optical filters was specially designed for the alh survey to achieve a good accuracy of photometric redshifts of @xmath0@xmath10z/(1+z)=0.015 for galaxies brighter than f814w@xmath424.5 , three times better than the one achieved when using the 4 - 5 filter systems ( for more information see * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "we do not have any mid - infrared ( mir ) nor far - infrared ( fir ) data as an input information for sed fitting , the reddest band we have is @xmath11 .",
    "this means that , following the well known mathematical relation between the observed and rest - frame wavelengths ( 1+z=@xmath12@xmath13/@xmath12@xmath14 ) , we can count with our k - corrections and measured absolute magnitudes and stellar masses down to redshifts @xmath01.3 in all 20 optical bands , and down to @xmath00.8 and @xmath00.4 in the @xmath15 and @xmath16 nir bands , respectively . we compared obtained stellar masses with those measured with bpz code .",
