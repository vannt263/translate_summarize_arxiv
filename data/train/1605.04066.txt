    "understanding disc dispersal is a key piece in the puzzle of planet formation as it sets the timescale over which ( gas giant ) planet formation must occur .",
    "furthermore the similarity between the observed timescales over which young stellar objects ( ysos ) lose their disc and the theoretically estimated timescale for the formation of planets suggests that the two processes are probably coupled and feed back on each other .",
    "the final build up of gaseous planets occurs in discs on their last gasp before dispersal , and the dispersal process itself can lead to rapid evolution of young planets ( owen & wu , 2016 ) , making evolved discs all the more interesting to study .",
    "a popular model to drive disc dispersal is photoevaporation by radiation from the central star ( e.g. clarke et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the exact nature of the driving radiation is however still open to debate .",
    "( extreme and far ) ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation as well as x - ray radiation has been shown to be able to drive winds from the disc upper layers ( alexander et al .",
    "2006 ; gorti , hollenbach & dullemond 2009 ; ercolano et al .",
    "2008 , 2009 ; owen et al .",
    "2010 ) that are efficient enough to disperse the discs in the observed timescales .",
    "however both the location and intensity of the wind depend strongly on the driving radiation , with differences of more than two orders of magnitude for mass loss rates predicted by different models .",
    "thus these different models obviously have profound implications for disc evolution and hence for the formation of planets and their subsequent evolution ( e.g. ercolano & rosotti 2015 ) .",
    "the presence of a warm , at least partially , ionised disc wind has been confirmed via the observation of a few km / s blue - shift in the profile of the [ neii ]  12.8@xmath0 m fine structure line ( pascucci et al .",
    "2007 ) . unfortunately modelling of this line",
    "can not shed light on the radiation source which drives the wind , due to the different routes to formation of the ne@xmath1 ion which have different efficiencies in a fully ionised euv - driven wind and in a quasi - neutral x - ray driven wind .",
    "ne@xmath1 formation occurs via the removal of a valence electron from ne atoms in the fully - ionised winds driven by euv radiation . in an x - ray",
    "driven wind ne@xmath1 is predominantly produced via charge exchange of ne@xmath2 with neutral h atoms , which are abundant in the quasi - neutral winds driven by x - rays .",
    "atomic physics thus conspires to the result that both an euv- and an x - ray driven wind , whose mass - loss rates differ by over two orders of magnitude , can equally well fit the observations ( ercolano & owen 2010 ; alexander 2008 ; pascucci et al .",
    "2011 ) .    forbidden lines from low - ionisation and atomic states of common elements may present an alternative way to study the wind dispersal mechanism . in particular",
    "a few km / s blueshift has been measured in the profiles of , for example , the [ oi ] 6300 , [ o i ] 5577 , [ s ii ] 6731 , and [ n ii ] 6583 lines ( e.g. hartigan et al . 1995 , white & hillenbrand 2004 , mohanty et al .",

    "the profiles are often double - peaked , with one component blue - shifted to a few hundred km / s ( high velocity component , hvc ) and a second component typically blue - shifted by only a few km / s ( low velocity component , lvc ) , typical of a photoionised wind .",
    "the hvc is generally attributed to emission from a dense outflows closer to the star or jets ( hartigan et al .",
    "the collisionally excited neutral oxygen line at 6300a , in particular , gained significant attention for its potential to discriminate between an euv- and an x - ray driven wind .",

    "it is important to note that since the wind itself is driven by the x - rays ( in the range 0.1 - 1  kev ) , modifying the soft uv spectrum will not effect the dynamics of the wind itself ( owen et al . 2012 ) , and it is thus not necessary to run new wind simulations for the purpose of this work .",
    "we have used our two - dimensional map of emissivities and gas velocities obtained from mocassin to reconstruct a three - dimensional cube of the disc and calculate the line - of - sight emission profiles for several of the [ oi ] transitions .",
