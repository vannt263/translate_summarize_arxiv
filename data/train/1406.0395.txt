    "in the effort of building more realistic equations of state ( eos ) on which the understanding of astrophysical issues as the structure and evolution of neutron stars ( ns ) or core - collapsing supernovae ( ccsn ) relies , special attention is presently paid to the behavior of baryonic matter at densities above nuclear matter saturation density .",
    "the subject is challenging as experimental data are too scarce to satisfactorily constrain the respective interactions , in particular if non - nucleonic degrees of freedom are involved .",
    "though , simple energetic arguments show that no reliable description can be conceived without considering strangeness  @xcite . as such",
    "it is hoped that astrophysical observations can eventually supplement the missing knowledge so far attained in terrestrial laboratories .",
    "an example in this sense is the present debate about the measurement of very massive neutron stars , and the associated core composition .",
    "the early conclusions ruling out hyperons from the ns core seem to be refuted by recent relativistic and non - relativistic mean - field models showing that a sufficiently repulsive hyperon - nucleon ( @xmath1-@xmath2 ) and hyperon - hyperon ( @xmath1-@xmath1 ) interaction at high densities is able to reconcile the two solar mass measurements corresponding to psr j1614 - 2230  @xcite and psr j0348 + 0432  @xcite with the onset of strangeness  @xcite without necessarily a very early deconfinement transition circumventing the hyperon puzzle  @xcite .",
    "the presence of hyperons in dense stellar matter is expected to have important astrophysical consequences .",
    "we can recall for instance the modification of the neutron star cooling rate due to hyperonic urca processes  @xcite leading to very fast cooling for stars with a mass high enough to allow for the onset of hyperons , a result , however , very sensitive to hyperonic pairing  @xcite , and thus subject to large uncertainties . by allowing for weak non - leptonic reactions (",
    "@xmath3 , @xmath4 ) , direct and modified hyperonic urca and strong interactions ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) hyperons are also shown to impact on bulk viscosity and , thus , damp r - mode instabilities @xcite .    most of the predictions are done within mean - field models . however , because of generic attractive and repulsive couplings between the different baryonic species , phase transitions could , in principle , be faced .",
    "an example is the liquid - gas phase transition occurring in nuclear matter .",
    "if there is a phase transition the mean - field solutions should be replaced by the gibbs construction in the phase coexisting domains , thus modifying the equation of state .",
    "the occurrence of a phase transition in strange compressed baryonic matter has already been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a new family of neutron stars characterized by much smaller radii than usually considered was predicted .",
    "however , very attractive hyperon - hyperon couplings were considered in that study , which presently appear ruled out by the experimental information on the ground state energy of double - lambda hypernuclei .",
    "a detailed study of the phase diagram of dense baryonic matter was recently undertaken in ref .",
    "@xcite within a non - relativistic mean - field model based on phenomenological functionals .",
    "the models in refs .",
    "@xcite considered a simplified setup , taking only @xmath7  @xcite and @xmath8  @xcite baryon mixtures into account .",
    "it was shown that under these assumptions first- and second- order phase transitions exist , and are expected to be explored under the strangeness equilibrium condition characteristic of stellar matter .",
    "two astrophysically relevant consequences have been worked out . in ref .  @xcite it has been demonstrated that in the vicinity of critical points the neutrino mean - free path is dramatically reduced , such that the neutrino transport can be considerably affected . ref .",
    "@xcite shows within a spherical simulation that , if during the proto - neutron star contraction after bounce the phase coexistence region is reached , a mini - collapse is induced , leading to pronounced oscillations of the proto - neutron star .",
    "our previous work suffers nevertheless of two major limitations .",
    "first , we considered the strangeness degree of freedom as fully exhausted by the @xmath9 hyperon . if the hyperonic couplings are such that @xmath10 or @xmath11 are more abundant than @xmath9 , as predicted by a series of models , the extension and localization of phase coexistence domains will be different .",
    "moreover , the possible dominance of a charged hyperon would impact on the direction of the order parameter and change the stability of the phase diagram with respect to the electron gas . in the extreme case",
    ", it could even make it disappear for neutron star matter .",
    "secondly , the previous study  @xcite employs only one specific model , a phenomenological energy density functional , with one parameter set , assuming in particular a strongly attractive hyperon - hyperon interaction .",
    "the most recent analysis @xcite of double-@xmath9 hypernuclei now tend to suggest a very small attraction in the @xmath9-@xmath9 channel , though experimental data are still very scarce and extrapolations to infinite matter uncertain .",
    "moreover accurate fits exist of microscopic brueckner calculations  @xcite providing functionals which are consistent with the available experimental data on nucleon-@xmath9 phase shifts .",
    "this can give some guidance on the functional in the nucleon-@xmath9 channel , although it is known that such models fail to reproduce the existence of very massive neutron stars .",
    "the aim of the present paper is thus twofold .",
    "firstly , to investigate the phase diagram of the whole baryonic octet . secondly , to test the sensitivity of the strangeness - driven phase transition on the hyperonic coupling constants .",
    "both @xmath12 and @xmath13 channels will be considered . since most experimental constraints concern the @xmath9-hyperon , to avoid proliferation of uncontrolled parameters , we will consider for this study only the simplest mixture @xmath14 which accounts for the three relevant densities : baryonic , charge / leptonic and strangeness .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ section : themodel ] briefly presents the model and the phenomenology of the phase transition .",
    "the phase diagram of purely baryonic , as well as charge - neutral baryonic matter with leptons are spotted in sections  [ section : uncharge ] and  [ section : neutral ] .",
    "the model dependence of the results is analyzed in section  [ section : modeldep ] by considering alternative density functionals for the @xmath2-@xmath1 and @xmath1-@xmath1-interactions and various values for the coupling constants .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section  [ section : concl ] .",
    "in non - relativistic mean - field models , the total energy density of homogeneous baryonic matter is given by the sum of mass and kinetic energy densities of different particle species and the potential energy density : @xmath15 where @xmath16 ; @xmath17 ; @xmath18 represent the baryon , strangeness and charge number densities , respectively , corresponding to the three good quantum numbers assuming equilibrium with respect to strong interaction .",
    "the particle and kinetic energy densities can be expressed in terms of fermi - dirac integrals , @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote , respectively , the inverse temperature , the effective @xmath24-particle mass and the effective chemical potential of the @xmath24-species self - defined by the single - particle density .",
    "the effective chemical potentials are related to the chemical potentials @xmath25 via @xmath26 where @xmath27 are the self - consistent mean field single - particle potentials .",
    "the potential energy density should in principle account for all possible couplings between nucleonic and hyperonic species , @xmath2-@xmath2 , @xmath2-@xmath1 and @xmath1-@xmath1 .",
    "the nuclear structure data constrain satisfactorily the @xmath2-@xmath2-interaction up to densities close to the normal nuclear saturation density and moderate isospin asymmetries , such that well constrained and reliable expressions for this functional , including isospin dependent effective masses and currents are available .",
    "the situation is much less clear for higher densities , strong isospin asymmetries as well as for channels containing hyperons .",
    "the most general expression of these potential energies can be expanded in a polynomial form @xmath28    as a guideline to characterize the couplings , the single particle potentials of baryon @xmath29 in pure @xmath30-matter are employed : @xmath31 .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath32 can then be adjusted to reproduce standard values of these potentials at some reference density , obtained within a ( model dependent ) analysis of the available experimental data .",
    "a skyrme - like expression has been frequently employed for the energy density , where the contribution of channel @xmath33 to the potential energy density is given by @xmath34 this form , which depends on only three parameters for each channel , is the simplest expression which corresponds to a controlled compressibility and fulfills the condition that @xmath35 vanishes at vanishing @xmath30-density @xmath36 , and becomes highly repulsive at @xmath30-high density @xmath37 .",
    "let us notice that this simple ( and probably simplistic ! ) form together with the fact that we fix it at one given density implies a coupling between short- and long - range behaviors of @xmath38 and @xmath39 potentials , @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "concerning the channels including strangeness , the available experimental information is particularly scarce .",
    "hypernuclei experiments only provide information on @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 potential well depths in symmetric nuclear matter at saturation densities and , to a less accurate extent , on the @xmath9-@xmath9 interaction potential . based on a wealth of @xmath9-hypernuclear data produced in @xmath45 reactions ,",

    "on the other hand , the observation of a @xmath53he bound state in a @xmath54he(@xmath55 ) reaction  @xcite pleads in favor of an attractive potential .",
    "very few multi - hyperon exotic nuclei data exist so far and all of them correspond to double-@xmath9 light nuclei .",

    ". the bond energy can be interpreted as a rough estimation of the @xmath63 potential at the average @xmath9 density @xmath64 inside the hypernucleus  @xcite .",
    "the extrapolation of few body systems binding energies into mean - field quantities is , nevertheless , problematic . in this sense",
    ", the more attractive values extracted from larger nuclei could appear more appealing for the present application .",
    "though , it is presently considered that the most accurate experimental data correspond to the nagara event with a bond energy of@xmath65 mev . in this work",

    "what regards the average @xmath9-density in light nuclei we shall use the value proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath67 .",
    "it is clear that fixing the standard value of the potential at one specific density only constrains one parameter of the generic @xmath29-@xmath30-interaction .",

    "<S> we study the thermodynamical properties of compressed baryonic matter with strangeness within non - relativistic energy density functional models with a particular emphasis on possible phase transitions found earlier for a simple @xmath0-mixture . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of the paper is twofold : i ) examining the phase structure of the complete system , including the full baryonic octet and ii ) testing the sensitivity of the results to the model parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , associated to the onset of the different hyperonic families , up to three separate strangeness - driven phase transitions may occur . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , a large fraction of the baryonic density domain is covered by phase coexistence with potential relevance for ( proto)-neutron star evolution . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the presence of a phase transition is compatible both with the observational constraint on the maximal neutron star mass , and with the present experimental information on hypernuclei . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we show that two solar mass neutron stars are compatible with important hyperon content . </S>",
    "<S> still , the parameter space is too large to give a definitive conclusion of the possible occurrence of a strangeness driven phase transition , and further constraints from multiple - hyperon nuclei and/or hyperon diffusion data are needed . </S>"
