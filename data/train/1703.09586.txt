    "in recent times , the _ ad hoc _ design of novel mesoscopic particles has opened new research avenues and brought several promising applications .",
    "significant examples of this bottom - up design appear in material science  @xcite , biotechnology  @xcite , and nanomedicine  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the highly versatile functionality of these new primary constituents relies on our efficacy to control the distinct interactions governing their dynamic and structural properties . +",
    "a notable family among these new primary components is that constituted by those nano- and meso - sized particles able to respond to an external magnetic field .",
    "these `` magnetic nanodevices '' are usually categorized according to their remanent magnetization at a given temperature after having been exposed to an external magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "thus mesoscopic particles consisting of single magnetic domains  @xcite can behave as permanent magnets due to their remanent ( or even spontaneous ) magnetization in the absence of an external magnetic field .",
    "this phenomenon is known as _ stable ferromagnetism _  @xcite . however ,",
    "if thermal energy is able to cause the random orientation of the different single magnetic domains , the particle remanent magnetization after removing the external magnetic field will be negligible . these particles , which present no magnetic hysteresis , are known as _ superparamagnetic particles _",
    "these two behaviors ( ferromagnetic and superparamagnetic ) are nowadays exploited in several consolidated research lines with a special emphasis in nanomedical applications  @xcite . + among the distinct mesoscopic particles , liposomes ( _ i.e. _ mesosized lipid vesicles ) have been recognized by their singular capabilities ( _ e.g. _ as drug delivery particles ) due to their synthetically controllable size , surface electric charge , membrane elastic properties , and encapsulation efficiency  @xcite . the superparamagnetic version of these highly tuneable particles results from our ability to encapsulate in their interior small ( single domain ) magnetite grains  @xcite .",
    "these are the so - called _",
    "magnetic liposomes_. thus these systems combine biocompatibility and vesicular structure  @xcite with their superparamagnetic character , therefore being magnetically controllable agents with no side - effects on the organism .",
    "fruitful applications using these systems are already amenable to experimentation covering specific areas in therapy and diagnostics such as chemotherapy  @xcite , hyperthermia  @xcite , magnetic resonance imaging  @xcite , magnetic cell targeting  @xcite , or magnetically driven delivery  @xcite . + reaching an efficient functionality for these vesicular systems ( and other magnetic nanoparticles ) depends on our understanding of the distinct particle interactions .",
    "this understanding is intrinsically connected with those mechanisms controlling stabilization and aggregation .",
    "indeed , magnetically induced aggregation not only provides us with an implicit understanding on the particle interaction but it is explicitly manifested in real applications .",
    "for instance , aggregates of superparamagnetic particles present an enhanced heating efficiency in hyperthermia as compared to that corresponding to non - aggregated samples  @xcite",
    ". the presence of aggregates can also increase the sensitivity of some detection techniques such as surface - enhanced raman scattering ( sers ) , leading to a significant increase of the raman intensity  @xcite .",
    "irreversible aggregates can also influence the system functionality when their size is comparable to those length scales defining the targeted microenvironment , _",
    "e.g. _ in enhanced permeability and retention ( epr )  @xcite or in the subsequent particle excretion from the body  @xcite .",
    "having in mind this motivation , the main purpose of this work is to investigate the still poorly understood mechanisms controlling aggregation for a representative system of magnetic vesicles .",
    "+ so far , magnetically induced aggregation has been experimentally investigated by different techniques being particularly focused on the study of superparamagnetic polystyrene particles .",
    "for instance , light scattering has been used to probe aggregation kinetics and/or aggregate structure  @xcite whereas two - dimensional microscopy images have been analyzed to look into the cluster morphology  @xcite . apart from studies on real systems , simulations and analytical approaches",
    "have also been proposed to rationalize the aggregation of ferro- and superpara - magnetic particles where magnetic interaction is treated in terms of a dipolar hard - sphere like model  @xcite . +",
    "as far as we know , in this work we present the first comprehensive study on the aggregation of magnetic liposomes in suspension for a controllable external magnetic field . by dynamic light scattering ( dls )",
    "we explore the aggregation kinetics and find an intermediate time regime where the aggregate diffusion coefficient presents a power law evolution .",
    "this evolution , which can be controlled by changing the magnetic field intensity , reaches at sufficiently long times a stationary value as a result of a competition between cluster formation and fragmentation .",
    "this final steady - state of the diffusion coefficient allows us to investigate the aggregate structure by static light scattering ( sls ) .",
    "this structure is fractal and results in increasingly linear aggregates upon increasing the magnetic field intensity .",
    "interestingly , we can appeal to scaling arguments and establish a relation between the aggregate fractal dimension and the power law exponent governing the aggregation kinetics . with this analytical approach",
    "we create a link between structure and dynamics in our system . to extend the aggregate characterization ,",
    "we directly observe the system by transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) and report a coexistence between reversible and irreversible aggregates ( _ i.e. _ aggregates that survive despite switching off the external magnetic field ) .",
    "finally , this coexistence is discussed in terms of an interplay between interactions of different origin .",
    "our results and the picture we offer may be of particular interest for predicting and controlling those time and length scales that play a relevant role in real physiological applications .",
    "+ the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we introduce the system and present our methodologies . in section iii",

    "the effect is apparent : @xmath61 decreases upon increasing the magnetic field intensity .",

    "irreversible aggregation in diluted suspensions ( like those studied here at intermediate times , fig .",

    "[ diffusion ] , and @xmath61 , fig .",
    "it is interesting to note from the table how @xmath125 is almost independent ( @xmath137 ) on the applied magnetic field intensity . as a result , here all the aggregation processes at intermediate times present a connection between their corresponding @xmath87 and @xmath61 values which leads to a common @xmath130 behavior given by eq.(9 ) . according to our previous discussion",
    ", we can reach a physical intuition for the negative @xmath125 value by considering that the decreasing aggregate diffusivity is not _ compensated _ by the increasing aggregate collision cross section as @xmath130 increases . indeed , the very geometry of the magnetic field lines around an aggregate results in an almost constant ( elongated ) cross section which will not depend on @xmath130  @xcite .",
    "however , diffusivity will decrease upon increasing @xmath130 with an expected power law evolution  @xcite .",
    "these scaling behaviors therefore lead to a more efficient reaction between small - small aggregates as compared with that between large - large aggregates .",
    "we now proceed to discussing the tem micrographs obtained from the magnetic liposome suspensions after applying an intense magnetic field of @xmath24 mt ( see section ii.b and fig .",

    "this magnetic field intensity is much higher than that applied during our light scattering experiments and almost corresponds to the liposome magnetic saturation ( fig .",

    "it is important to stress that before capturing our tem micrographs , the sample first aggregates according to the protocol described in section ii.b and then , after being exposed to the magnetic field , the magnetic field is removed leaving the sample to evolve for several minutes ( this time is indeed significantly greater than that needed to recover the almost monomeric state reported in fig .  [ break ] ) .",

    "micrographs also support a second _ structural _ message : irreversible aggregates show an almost linear structure ( fig .",

    "the only non - linear ( branched ) structures we see ( albeit scarce ) correspond to `` y - like '' shaped aggregates where one of the liposomes acts as a junction point between two branches ( fig .",

    "the micrographs correspond to different control regions and different magnifications . ]    [ pannel_tem ]    we now discuss some specific but still significant details . on one hand",
    ", aggregate size polydispersity seems to be rather low ( with an average number of liposomes per aggregate of the order of @xmath0 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "irreversible aggregates seem to be constituted by rather monodisperse liposomes , that is , the size polydispersity of the liposomes forming the irreversible aggregates seems to be lower than that corresponding to the whole sample ( section iii.a ) .",
    "this rather monodisperse aggregate composition is compatible with theoretical predictions for chain - like aggregates in polydisperse ferrofluids where the presence of small magnetic particles as part of the aggregates is not favorable  @xcite . on this theoretical basis",
    ", we could understand the presence of small magnetite spots in our tem micrographs as a manifestation of small dried magnetic liposomes which were not able of being part of the irreversible aggregates . + aggregate shape also deserves further discussion . magnetic particles with remanent magnetization in the absence of an external magnetic field can in principle self - assemble into closed aggregates .",
    "in particular , computational studies on dipolar hard - spheres  @xcite and experimental investigations with microscopic ferromagnetic particles  @xcite show the emergence of ring shaped aggregates .",
    "however , our irreversible aggregates do not show ( at least from the current tem micrographs ) ring structures .",
    "the absence of rings ( whose presence is expected for particles with a high remanent magnetization ) can represent a manifestation of the superparamagnetic nature of the magnetic liposomes for which no magnetic hysteresis was detected ( fig .  [ characterization]b ) ) . in this respect , and giving that we can not appeal to particle remanent magnetization , what is the interaction mechanism responsible for maintaining the integrity of our irreversible aggregates in the absence of an external magnetic field ?      reaching a precise quantitative answer to the previous question needs further systematic investigation , specially focused on the empirical phenomenology associated to the different interactions governing aggregation and stabilization in our system . instead , here we address this question by briefly discussing a plausible schematic picture based on purely heuristic arguments .",
    "+ coexistence between reversible and irreversible aggregation in mesoscopic particle systems has been rationalized by the existence of primary and secondary minima of the particle potential energy  @xcite .",
    "thus , when aggregation is promoted by a certain mechanism ( _ e.g. _ here by applying an external magnetic field ) , particles can in principle aggregate in a permanent ( irreversible ) state which is associated to a primary minimum where the aggregated state will be maintained despite canceling the mechanism provoking aggregation ( _ e.g. _ by switching off the external magnetic field ) .",
    "however , particles can also aggregate in a secondary minimum being restored to their non - aggregated state as soon as the mechanism promoting aggregation is canceled .",
    "+ the idea of an interaction mechanism based on the existence of primary and secondary minima to understand irreversible and reversible aggregation is schematically presented in figure  [ interactions ] for a magnetically induced aggregation process .",
    "thus , in the presence of an external magnetic field ( blue line ) some particles ( purple ) aggregate in a permanent ( irreversible ) primary minimum whereas other ( blue particles ) aggregate in a ( reversible ) secondary minimum . when the external magnetic field is switched off ( red line ) ,",
    "particles aggregating in the secondary minimum become separated .",
    "theoretical approximations based on this underlying picture have been proposed in the past to understand the aggregation of superparamagnetic colloidal latex particles  @xcite . in this context , the emergence of primary and secondary minima results from the interplay ( or competition ) between coulombic repulsion ( treated by a linear superposition approximation ) , london - van der waals attraction ( derjaguin approach ) , and magnetic dipole - dipole attraction .",
    "this approach has indeed shown to be successful for predicting and controlling magnetic flocculation to concentrate or remove ultrafine magnetic particles ( linear size smaller than @xmath1 @xmath6 m )  @xcite .",
    "+        [ interactions ]    these interactions  @xcite ( _ i.e. _ dlvo and magnetic dipole - dipole interactions ) seem to play , _ a priori _ , a significant role by governing stabilization - aggregation in our magnetic liposome system .",
    "thus , coulombic repulsion is present in our system as manifested by the non - negligible zeta - potential  @xcite whereas london - van der waals interaction has been identified as the main short range attraction between lipid membranes  @xcite .",
    "in addition , a non - dlvo ingredient widely reported in the liposome literature should presumably be considered to reach a complete theoretical description for the magnetic liposome aggregation mechanism : short range hydration repulsion  @xcite .",
    "+ to calibrate whether or not this _ complete _ approach is consistent with a primary - secondary minimum scenario in the present system , additional experiments should be performed . in particular , a more refined control of the magnetic field intensity would help us to better quantify the emergence of primary and secondary minima .",
    "moreover , further experiments in the presence of added electrolyte could also help us to judiciously manipulate coulombic and hydration repulsions  @xcite , therefore providing valuable quantitative information on the interplay between attractive and repulsive interactions . in the meantime",
    ", we are led to speculate on the primary - secondary minimum picture as a plausible mechanism to explain irreversibility - reversibility in our system suggesting future systematic experimental work to resolve this issue further .",
    "we have presented a comprehensive study on the aggregation of superparamagnetic liposomes in solution under the influence of a controllable external magnetic field . we have investigated the liposome aggregation kinetics , the aggregate structure , and the coexistence between reversible and irreversible aggregation by dynamic and static light scattering ( dls and sls ) , and by images obtained from transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) .",
    "+ aggregation kinetics has been probed by dls and followed by the time evolution of the aggregate diffusion coefficient . for a constant magnetic field intensity",
    ", the aggregate diffusion coefficient shows a stationary value at sufficiently long times which decreases upon increasing the external magnetic field intensity .",
    "we have proven how this stationary value , which is here interpreted as a balance between liposome cluster aggregation and fragmentation , scales with the square of the liposome magnetization . before reaching its stationary value , the diffusion coefficient follows a time dependent power law behavior with a kinetic exponent , @xmath87 , which increases upon increasing magnetic field intensity . as a manifestation of aggregation reversibility , we have further shown how liposomes aggregating under the influence of a low magnetic field intensity ( @xmath138 mt ) almost recover their initial ( non - aggregated ) state when the external magnetic field is switched off .",
    "+ we have taken advantage of the long time stationary value of the liposome aggregate diffusion coefficient to probe the aggregate structure by sls through the aggregate structure factor .",
    "thus we have proven the aggregate structure to be fractal and shown how the fractal dimension , @xmath61 , decreases upon increasing the external magnetic field intensity , resulting in the emergence of almost linear aggregate structures ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "we have finally shown how structure and dynamics are connected in our system by finding a scaling relation between the kinetic exponent , @xmath87 , and the aggregate fractal dimension , @xmath61 , which allows us to understand aggregation kinetics and aggregate structure in terms of a single homogeneity parameter .",
    "+ by tem micrographs we have also shown the existence of irreversible liposome aggregates which result from an aggregation process in the presence of an intense external magnetic field ( @xmath139 mt ) .",
