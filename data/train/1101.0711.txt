    "blazars are a subclass of radio - loud agns characterized by strong and rapid flux variability across the entire em spectrum and strong polarization from radio to optical wavelengths .",
    "microvariability , or intraday variability ( idv ) is commonly observed across much of the electromagnetic ( em ) spectrum of agns but is particularly common in blazars .",
    "a change of flux of @xmath1115% within a few minutes to hours reflect extreme physical conditions embedded in small sub - parsec scales . according to the usually accepted orientation based unified model of radio - loud agns",
    ", blazar jets usually make an angle @xmath3 to our line - of - sight @xcite .",
    "the doppler boosting of the jet emission means that most of what we see from blazars arises in those jets .",
    "these jet dominated agns provide a natural laboratory to study the mechanisms of energy extraction from the vicinity of central supermassive black holes , the physical properties of jets and perhaps also accretion disks .",
    "the radiation of blazars across the whole em spectrum is predominantly non - thermal . at lower frequencies ( through the uv or x - ray bands )",
    "the mechanism is almost certainly synchrotron emission while at higher frequencies it is very probably dominated by inverse - compton ( ic ) emission @xcite .",
    "the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of blazars have a double - peaked structure @xcite .",
    "based on the location of the peak of their seds , blazars are often sub - classified into the low energy peaked blazars ( lbls ) and high energy peaked blazars ( hbls ) ; the first component peaks in the near - infrared ( nir)/optical in case of lbls and in the uv / x - rays in hbls , while the second component usually peaks at gev energies in lbls and at tev energies in hbls .",
    "the study of variability is one of the most powerful tools for revealing the nature of blazars and probing the various processes occurring in them . based on their different timescales",
    ", the variability of blazars can be broadly divided into three classes , idv , short - term variability ( stv ) , and long - term variability ( ltv ) .",
    "variations in the flux of source up to a few tenths of magnitude over a time scale of a day or less is known as idv @xcite or microvariability , or intra - night optical variability .",
    "variations of days to a few months are often considered to be stv , while those from several months to many years are usually called ltv ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; both of these classes of variations for blazars typically exceed @xmath1 1 magnitude and can exceed even 5 magnitudes . over the last two decades ,",
    "the optical variability of blazars has been extensively studied on diverse timescales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "there are several theoretical models that might be able to explain the observed variability over wide time - scales for all bands , with the leading contenders all variants of models based upon shocks propagating down relativistic jets @xcite",
    ". some of the variability may arise from helical structures , precession or other geometrical effects occurring within the jets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and some of the radio variability is due to extrinsic propagative effects @xcite .",
    "hot spots or other disturbances in or above accretion disks surrounding the black holes at the centres of agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are likely to play a key role in the variability of non - blazar agns and might provide seed fluctuations that could be advected into a rotating blazar jet and then be doppler amplified .    despite the large amount of information we have about blazars",
    "that is very briefly summarized above , we still lack sufficient understanding of basic parameters of the emission regions , such as jet composition , a quantitative assessment of beaming parameters , or the processes leading to the origin of shocks in the jets .",
    "these physical quantities are obviously important in understanding the physics of jets and their emission regions and additional idv studies leading to statistically valid pictures of many blazars can help constrain them .",
    "in this paper we present the results of an extensive idv studies of a sample of ten lbls including six bl lacs and four fsrqs .",
    "the work presented here is focused on intraday variations in the r passband magnitudes of these sources , which were the brightest blazars visible from aries , nainital , india and prl , mount abu india .",
    "we also compare our observational results to some of those presented in the literature .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section 2 , we present the observations and data reduction procedure . section 3 provides our analysis and results .",
    "we present our discussion and conclusions in section 4 .",
    "we have carried out optical r band photometric observations of ten lbls from september 2008 to june 2009 using two telescopes in india .",
    "the details of the telescopes and instruments used are given in table 1 and the observation details are in table 2 .",
    "for doing image processing , or data pre - processing , we generated a master bias frame for each observing night by taking the median of all bias frames ; the master bias frame was subtracted from all flat and source image frames taken on that night .",
    "then the master flat in each passband was generated by median combine of flat frames in that passband .",
    "finally , the normalized master flat in each passband was generated .",
    "as usual , each source image frame was divided by the normalized master flat in the respective passband to remove pixel - to - pixel inhomogeneities ( flat fielding ) . finally cosmic ray removal was done from all source image frames .",
    "this pre - processing of the data was done by using standard routines in the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) software .",
    "our data analysis , or processing of the data , utilizes dominion astronomical observatory photometry ( daophot ii ) software to perform aperture photometry @xcite .",
    "we carried out aperture photometry with four different aperture radii , 1@xmath4fwhm , 2@xmath4fwhm , 3@xmath4fwhm and 4@xmath4fwhm .",
    "on comparing the results , we observed that aperture radii = 3@xmath4fwhm provided the best s / n ratio , and we have adopted that in this work . for all of the ten blazars , we observed more than three local standard stars .",
    "the magnitudes of the standard stars we used in the fields of our sources are given in table 3 .",
    "the multiple comparison stars were used to check that the usual standard stars were non - variable .",
    "we have used two non - varying standard stars from each blazar field and plotted their differential instrumental magnitudes in figs .",
    "finally , for the calibration of blazar data , we have used the one standard star that has a colour close to the blazar from those two standards stars .",
    "the calibrated light curves of the blazars are plotted in the same panel with the differential instrumental magnitudes of two standard stars .",
    "we checked for the presence of microvariability both by using the @xmath6-test @xcite and the variability detection parameter , @xmath7 for the sake of comparison with earlier papers , which nearly always used that approach . for two sample variances ,",
    "say s@xmath8 , for the quasar differential light curves and s@xmath9 , for that of the standard star @xmath10 the @xmath6-statistic is compared with a critical value corresponding to the significance level set for the test .",
    "we have used the inbuilt f test code available in r. a @xmath11-value of @xmath12 0.01 ( @xmath1399@xmath2 significance level ) is adopted for our variability detection criterion .",
    "the variability detection parameter is defined as ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ) the average of @xmath14and @xmath15 where @xmath16 here ( bl @xmath5 stara ) and ( bl @xmath5 starb ) are the differential instrumental magnitudes of the blazar and standard star a and the blazar and standard star b , respectively , while @xmath17(bl@xmath5stara ) and @xmath17(bl@xmath5starb ) are the observational scatters of the differential instrumental magnitude of the blazar and star a and the blazar and star b , respectively",
    ". if @xmath18 , a conservative confidence level of a variability detection is @xmath19% , and we consider this to be a positive detection of a variation using this criterion . as noted by @xcite this c - statistic does not behave as a proper statistic should , but as it has been used in most of the idv studies in literature , we also employed this test .",
    "the percentage variation in the intraday light curves of lbls is calculated by using the variability amplitude parameter , @xmath20 , introduced by @xcite , defined as @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the maximum and minimum magnitudes in the calibrated light curves of the blazar and @xmath17 is the average measurement error of the blazar light curve .",
    "the calculated @xmath6-statistics , @xmath24-``statistics '' and variability amplitude parameter , @xmath20 , values are listed in table 4 .",
    "the first order structure function ( sf ) is a very useful tool to search for periodicities and timescales of variability in time series data trains @xcite .",
    "here we give only a very brief introduction to the method ; for details refer to @xcite .",
    "the first order sf for a data train , @xmath25 , is defined as @xmath26}^{2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the time lag , @xmath28 , and the weighting factor , @xmath29 is 1 if a measurement exists for the @xmath30 interval , and 0 otherwise .",
    "the behaviour of the first order sf can be simply summarized .",
    "the sf curves for agn usually at first rise with time lag . following this rising portion",
    ", the sf will then fall into one of the following classes : ( i ) if no plateau exists , any time scale of variability exceeds the length of the data train ; ( ii ) if there are one or more plateaus , each one indicates a possible time scale of variability ; and ( iii ) if that plateau is followed by a dip in the sf , the lag corresponding to the minimum of that dip indicates a possible periodic cycle ( unless such a dip is seen at a lag close to the maximum length of the data train , when it is probably an artifact )",
    ". however , ( iv ) uncorrelated data produce a white noise behaviour , characterized by a constant slope @xcite .",
    "we have carried out the sf analysis of all of those lcs which satisfy the variability detection criteria .",
    "recently , some weaknesses of the sf method , including spurious indications of timescales and periodicities have been discussed by @xcite , so we cross check the sf results by using the discrete correlation function ( dcf ) method .",
    "the timescales of variability calculated using the sf analysis are listed in table 4 .",
    "the discrete correlation function ( dcf ) method was first introduced by @xcite and it was later generalized to provide better error estimates @xcite . here we give only a brief introduction to the method ; for details refer to @xcite , @xcite , and references therein .",
    "the first step is to calculate the unbinned correlation ( udcf ) using the given time series through @xcite @xmath31 here @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the individual points in two time series @xmath25 and @xmath34 , respectively , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are respectively the means of the time series , and @xmath37 and @xmath38 are their variances .",
    "the correlation function is binned after calculation of the udcf .",
    "the dcf method does not automatically define a bin size , so several values need to be tried .",
    "if the bin size is too big , useful information is lost , but if the bin size is too small , a spurious correlation can be found . taking @xmath39 as the centre of a time bin and @xmath40 as the number of points in each bin",
    ", the dcf is found from the udcf via @xmath41 the error for each bin can be calculated using @xmath42 ^ 2 \\bigr\\}^{0.5 } .\\ ] ]    a dcf analysis is frequently used for finding the correlation and possible lags between multi - frequency agn data where different data trains are used in the calculation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "when the same data train is used , so @xmath25=@xmath34 , there is obviously a peak at zero dcf , indicating that there is no time lag between the two , but any other strong peaks in the dcf give indications of variability timescales .",
    "the calculated @xmath43 values using dcf analyses are listed in table 4 .",
    "the r filter light curves ( lcs ) of the blazars in which significant variability has been detected , along with their corresponding sf and dcf analysis curves , are displayed in figures 1@xmath57 ; the remaining non - variable lcs of the blazars are plotted along with the corresponding curves of the standard stars used for comparison in figures 8 and 9 .",
    "the complete observing log for the blazars in given in table 3 .",
    "the values of @xmath20 , @xmath24 , @xmath6-test along with any estimated timescales of variability found using sf and dcf analysis methods on the individual blazar lcs are listed in table 4 .",
    "a detailed multiband optical short term variability ( stv ) study of the fluxes and colours of all of these blazars over the same time period of observation is reported in @xcite .",
    "there we showed that the colour versus brightness correlations seen in these sources support the hypothesis that bl lacs tends to be bluer with increase in brightness while fsrqs shows the opposite trend .",

    "we observed two idv lcs of the source on october 24 and 28 , 2008 . during the period the brightness of the source increases by @xmath10.4 magnitude @xcite .",
    "the source showed significant microvariations of @xmath10.13 magnitude on october 24 , 2008 ( fig .",
    "7 ) while no significant variations has been detected for the lc observed on october 28 , 2008 .",
    "the sf and dcf analysis revealed that any timescale of variability exceeds the length of the observation on the first of those nights .",
    "we have carried out optical r band idv observations of ten lbls spanning over a time period of 2008 september to 2009 june . the sources pks 0420@xmath5014 and pks 1510@xmath5089 were in faint states ; ao 0235@xmath46164 , bl lac and 3c 454.3 were possibly in post - outburst states ; s5 0716@xmath46714 and 3c",
    "66a were in pre - outburst states , while pks 0735@xmath46178 and oj 287 were in some intermediate states during the observing run @xcite . in our search of microvariations in ten lbls we found significant idv in 21 out",
    "of 40 observed lcs ; so the calculated duty cycle of idv in lbls during our observing run is @xmath152@xmath2 .",
    "we performed the sf and dcf analysis to calculate the nominal timescales of variability ; however we found that in most of the cases this timescale of variability is longer than the length of observations and in a substantial majority of the cases where the sf indicated a possible timescale the dcf did not support it .",
    "the blazar emission mechanism in the outburst state is quantitatively understood by relativistic shocks propagating through a relativistic jet of plasma . in general ,",
    "blazar emission in the outburst state is non - thermal doppler - boosted emission from jets enhanced by that arising from shocks in the flows .",
    "the other models of agns that can explain the idv in any type of agn are optical flares , disturbances or hot spots on the accretion disk surrounding the black hole of the agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "models based on the instabilities on the accretion disk could convinancibly yield blazar idv only when the blazar is in the very low state .",
    "when a blazar is in the low state , any contribution from the jets , if at all present , is very weak .",
    "so , we consider that the observed idv in the sources ao 0235@xmath46164 , bl lac , 3c 454.3 , s5 0716@xmath46714 , 3c 66a , 0735@xmath46178 and oj 287 is almost certainly related to a shock propagating through a relativistic jet @xcite .",
    "turbulence behind a shock propagating down such a jet is a very feasible way to explain the observed idv @xcite . since the blazars pks 0420@xmath5014 and pks 1510@xmath5089",
    "were observed in relatively faint states , there is a chance that the observed optical idv in these source may be because of hot spots or any other enhanced emission on the accretion disk @xcite .    in one source , 3c 273 , we are unable to classify the state of the source since this blazar has been in an essentially steady state for last six years @xcite .",
    "this source showed significant microvariations in two out of eight observed lcs and on both of days of observation the brightness of the source follows both rising and fading trends of @xmath10.05 magnitude .",
    "whatever may be the mechanism responsible for the origin of of microvariability in this source , it does not seem to be strong enough to introduce day - to - day variations in the flux of the source .",
    "it is worth noting that an extrinsic mechanism can also be responsible for some of the observed idv in blazars .",
    "extrinsic idv could be caused by refractive interstellar scintillation , which is only relevant in low - frequency radio observations , or microlensing , which is achromatic .",
    "we note that the blazar ao 0235@xmath46164 has two foreground galaxies at @xmath59 and @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "the flux of this source is contaminated and absorbed by foreground galaxies , the stars of which can act as gravitational microlenses .",
    "thus the observed optical idv in ao 0235 + 164 could arise , at least partially , from gravitational microlensing . using two separated telescopes to simultaneously observe 0716@xmath46714 @xcite showed that instrumental and atmospheric effects can not account for the microvariations they measured for that blazar .",
    "we found significant idv in 21 out of 40 observed lcs of ten lbls ; so the calculated duty cycle of idv in lbls during our observing run is @xmath152@xmath2 .",
    "the average duration of our observation was 3.7 hrs per lc .",
    "the sf and dcf curves revealed that in @xmath160@xmath2 cases any timescale of variability is longer than the timescale of observations .",
    "in quite a few cases there were hints of timescales in the data from the sf plots , but only a few of those hints were supported by the dcf plots .",
    "extensive idv studies of different subclasses of agns revealed that the occurrence of idv in blazars observed on a timescale of @xmath616 hrs is @xmath160@xmath565@xmath2 and if the blazar is observed more than 6 hrs then the possibility of idv detection is 80@xmath585@xmath2 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "if we consider observations over days to months , i.e. , at stv timescales then the observed duty cycle of variations is @xmath4992@xmath2 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and at ltv timescales it is almost 100@xmath2 , which confirms that the probability of detection of variability in blazars rises with the duration of the observations . although the duty cycle from our current observations is less than that reported by @xcite , since the average duration of our observations is @xmath614 hrs , this is unsurprising .",
