    "it is known that many evolving network systems , including the world wide web , as well as social , biological , and communication systems , show power law distributions . in particular , the number of nodes with @xmath0 links is often observed to be @xmath1 , where @xmath2 typically varies from 2.0 to 3.1 @xcite . the mechanism for power - law network",
    "scaling was addressed in a seminal paper by barabsi and albert ( ba ) who proposed @xcite a simple growing network model in which the probability of a new node forming a link with an old node ( the  attachment probability \" ) is proportional to the number of links of the old node .",
    "this model yields a power law distribution of links with exponent @xmath3 .",
    "many other works have been done extending this the model .",
    "for example krapivsky and redner @xcite provide a comprehensive description for a model with more general dependence of the attachment probability on the number @xmath0 of old node links . for attachment probability proportional to @xmath4 they found that , depending on @xmath5 , the exponent @xmath2 can vary from 2 to @xmath6 . furthermore , for @xmath7 , when @xmath8 , @xmath9 decays faster than a power law , while when @xmath10 , there emerges a single node which connects to nearly all other nodes .",
    "other modifications of the model are the introduction of aging of nodes @xcite , initial attractiveness of nodes @xcite , the addition or re - wiring of links @xcite , the assignment of weights to links @xcite , etc .",
    "we have attempted to construct more general growing network models featuring two effects which have not been considered previously : ( i ) multiple species of nodes [ in real network systems , there may be different species of nodes with each species having different properties ( _ e.g. , each species may have different probabilities for adding new nodes and may also have different attachment probabilities to the same node species and to other node species , etc . ) ] .",
    "( ii ) initial link distributions [ _ i.e. , when a new node is born , its number of links to old nodes is not necessarily a constant number , but , rather , is characterized by a given probability distribution @xmath11 of new links ] . _ _    as an application of our model , we investigate the movie - actor network with movies considered as nodes and actors as links ( _ i.e. , if the same actor appears in two movies there is a link between the two movies @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , we consider theatrical movies and made - for - television movies to constitute two different species .",
    "we construct a growing network model which incorporates multiple species and initial link probabilities . given an initial network , we create new nodes at a constant rate . we let the new node belong to species @xmath12 with probability @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) . we decide how many links",
    "@xmath15 the new node establishes with already existing nodes by randomly choosing @xmath15 from a probability distribution @xmath16 .",
    "then , we randomly attach the new node to @xmath15 existing nodes with preferential attachment probability proportional to a factor @xmath17 , where @xmath0 is the number of links of the target node of species @xmath18 to which the new node of species @xmath12 may connect .",
    "that is , the connection probability between an existing node and a new node is determined by the number of links of the existing node and the species of the new node and the target node .    as for the single species case @xcite",
    ", the evolution of this model can be described by rate equations . in our case",
    "the rate equations give the evolution of @xmath19 , the number of species @xmath18 nodes that have @xmath0 links , @xmath20 } { \\sum_m \\sum_k a^{(j , m)}_k n^{(m)}_k } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + q^{(i)}p^{(i)}_k , \\label{eq : nk}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the total number of species and @xmath22 is the average number of new links to a new node of species @xmath12 , and @xmath23 is normalized so that the rate of creation of new nodes is one per unit time .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath24 accounts for the increase of @xmath19 due to the addition of a new node of species @xmath12 that links to a species @xmath18 node with @xmath25 connections .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath26 accounts for the decrease of @xmath19 due to linking of a new species @xmath12 node with an existing species @xmath18 node with @xmath0 connections .",
    "the denominator , @xmath27 , is a normalization factor .",
    "if we add a new node with @xmath15 initial links , we have @xmath15 chances of increasing / decreasing @xmath19 .",
    "this is accounted for by the factor @xmath28 appearing in the summand of eq .",
    "( [ eq : nk ] ) .",
    "the last term , @xmath29 , accounts for the introduction of new nodes of species @xmath18 . since all nodes have at least one link , @xmath30 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : nk ] ) implies that total number of nodes and total number of links increase at fixed rates . the total number of nodes of species @xmath18 increases at the rate @xmath31 .",
    "thus @xmath32 the link summation over all species @xmath33 is twice the total number of links in the network .",

    "( [ eq : nk ] ) yields @xmath38 where @xmath39 is @xmath40 _",
    "to most simply illustrate the effect of spread in the initial number of links , we first consider the case of a network with a single species of node and with a simple form for the attachment @xmath41 . in particular , we choose @xcite , @xmath42 .",

    "hence , for _ sufficiently large @xmath0 we have @xmath60 if @xmath61 , and @xmath62 if @xmath63 .",

    "the values of @xmath69 used for the figure are @xmath70 , and @xmath6 ( @xmath71 corresponds to @xmath72 for @xmath73 ) . for clarity",
    "@xmath9 has been shifted by a constant factor so that @xmath74 coincides with the corresponding value of @xmath75 . also , to separate the graphs for easier visual inspection , the value of @xmath75 for successive @xmath69 values is changed by a constant factor [ since ( [ eq : sol1 ] ) is linear , the form of the solution is not effected ] .",
    "we note from fig .",
    "[ fig : model](a ) that @xmath9 follows @xmath11 for @xmath76 in all cases .",
    "this is as expected , since @xmath11 decreases slower than @xmath77 in this range .",

    "as @xmath69 increases deviations of @xmath9 from @xmath11 in @xmath73 become more evident , and the large @xmath0 asymptotic @xmath77 dependence is observed .",
    "thus , if @xmath11 decreases sufficiently rapidly , then the behavior of @xmath9 is determined by the growing network dynamics , while , if @xmath11 decreases slowly , then the behavior of @xmath9 is determined by @xmath11 . _    to simply illustrate the effect of multiple species we now consider a growing two species network with @xmath79 ( _ i.e. , @xmath80 for @xmath81 ) .",
    "then , eq . ( [ eq : eta ] ) becomes _    [ eq : eta1 ] @xmath82    where @xmath83 represents summation of species @xmath84 and @xmath85 nodes .    in order to illustrate the model with our numerical simulations",
    ", we specialize to a specific case .",
    "we choose attachment coefficients @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 .",
    "thus a new species @xmath84 node connects to either existing species @xmath84 nodes and species @xmath85 nodes with equal probability , while a new species @xmath85 node can connect to existing species @xmath84 nodes only . therefore , the first summation term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eta1 ] ) , @xmath90 , becomes @xmath91 , which is @xmath92 times the total increase of links at each time @xmath93 .",
    "recall that @xmath94 . in order to calculate the second summation term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eta1 ] ) , @xmath95 , we define a parameter @xmath96 that is the ratio of the total number of links of species @xmath84 to the total number of links in the network . since the probability of linking a new species @xmath84 node to existing species @xmath84 nodes is determined by the total number of links of species @xmath84 , this probability is exactly same as @xmath96 . thus , if we add a new species @xmath84 node , the number of links of species @xmath84 increases by @xmath97 due to the new node and by @xmath98 due to the existing species @xmath84 nodes that become connected with the new node , while the number of links of species @xmath85 increases by @xmath99 .",
    "but , if we add a new species @xmath85 node , the numbers of links increases by @xmath100 for both species because a new species @xmath85 node can link to species @xmath84 nodes only . thus , the increase of species @xmath84 links is @xmath101 and that of species @xmath85 links is @xmath102 .",

    "proceeding as for the single species case , we approximate ( [ eq : sol ] ) by an ordinary differential equation ( _ c.f . , eq . ( [ eq : sol2 ] ) ) to obtain @xmath108 .",
