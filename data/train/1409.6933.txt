    "the current development of gravitational wave detectors gives a new motivation for improving our theoretical understanding of the general relativistic dynamics of compact binary systems , i.e. , systems comprising black holes and/or neutron stars .",
    "recent work has shown that tidal interactions have a significant influence on the late dynamics of coalescing neutron star binaries @xcite .",
    "it makes it urgent to refine the theoretical description of tidal effects in the strong - field regime reached in the last stages of the inspiralling phase of neutron star binaries .    in recent years",
    ", it has been understood that a useful strategy for studying the strong - field aspects of the dynamics of compact binaries is to combine , in a synergetic manner , information gathered from several different approximation methods , namely : the post - newtonian ( pn ) formalism , the post - minkowskian one , the gravitational self - force ( sf ) formalism , full numerical relativity simulations , and , the effective one - body ( eob ) formalism .",
    "in particular , the eob formalism @xcite appears to define a useful framework which can combine , in an efficient and accurate manner , information coming from all the other approximation schemes , while also adding genuinely new information coming from eob theory . for recent examples of this synergetic use of eob theory",
    "@xcite .    in the present paper , we shall refine the theoretical description of tidal interactions by combining , within eob theory , three types of information : ( i ) the state - of - the - art pn knowledge of tidal interaction in comparable mass binary systems ( which is limited to the 2pn level @xcite ) ;",
    "( ii ) the extension to tidal effects of a recently developed high - accuracy analytic description of extreme - mass - ratio binary systems to linear order in the mass ratio @xmath1 @xcite ; and ( iii ) recent numerical self - force computations of some tidal invariants to linear order in @xmath2 @xcite .    an important aspect of the present work will be to transcribe the purely kinematic knowledge of some tidal invariants ( expressed as functions of the dimensionless frequency parameter @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the orbital frequency ) into the _ dynamical _ knowledge of the tidal interaction energy of binary systems .",
    "this will be done within the eob formulation of tidal effects proposed by damour and nagar @xcite . up to now",
    "this formulation has been developed only through pn theory , and was limited to the fractional second post - newtonian ( 2pn ) level , i.e. , at the level where one includes relativistic corrections of order @xmath5 to the newtonian tidal binding energy @xcite .",
    "[ for previous , 1pn accurate , tidal computations see @xcite . ]    here , thanks to the technology developed in our previous papers @xcite , we shall be able to analytically compute several tidal invariants to a very high - order accuracy , namely 7.5pn , i.e. @xmath6 beyond the newtonian level , but only to _ linear _ order in @xmath2",
    ". we shall then transcribe this kinematic information into a more dynamically useful form .",
    "more precisely , we shall compute to 7.5pn accuracy the relativistic factors @xmath7 that multiply the leading - order eob description of the tidal interaction energy in binary systems . as we shall see in detail later , the label @xmath8 denotes the multipolarity of the considered interaction , while @xmath9 denotes its parity : @xmath10 for even ( or electric - like ) parity , and @xmath11 for odd ( or magnetic - like ) parity",
    ". our main focus will be the two dominant tidal interactions : quadrupolar - electric ( @xmath12 ) and quadrupolar - magnetic ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "another important aspect of our synergetic study of tidal effects will be to compare our 7.5pn - accurate analytic results to the recent accurate numerical self - force results of dolan et al .",
    "@xcite on some tidal invariants .",
    "in addition , we shall combine our analytic pn and eob knowledge with the accurate data of @xcite to propose some simple , but numerically accurate , analytic representations of the eob tidal relativistic factors @xmath14 valid in the strong field regime @xmath15 , relevant for describing the late stages of coalescing neutron star binaries . to guide the reader through our later developments ,",

    "<S> tidal interactions have a significant influence on the late dynamics of compact binary systems , which constitute the prime targets of the upcoming network of gravitational - wave detectors . </S>",
    "<S> we refine the theoretical description of tidal interactions ( hitherto known only to the second post - newtonian level ) by extending our recently developed analytic self - force formalism , for extreme mass - ratio binary systems , to the computation of several tidal invariants . specifically , we compute , to linear order in the mass ratio and to the 7.5@xmath0 post - newtonian order , the following tidal invariants : the square and the cube of the gravitoelectric quadrupolar tidal tensor , the square of the gravitomagnetic quadrupolar tidal tensor , and the square of the gravitoelectric octupolar tidal tensor . </S>",
    "<S> our high - accuracy analytic results are compared to recent numerical self - force tidal data by dolan et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and , notably , provide an analytic understanding of the light ring asymptotic behavior found by them . </S>",
    "<S> we transcribe our kinematical tidal - invariant results in the more dynamically significant effective one - body description of the tidal interaction energy . by combining , in a synergetic manner , analytical and numerical results , we provide simple , accurate analytic representations of the global , strong - field behavior of the gravitoelectric quadrupolar tidal factor . </S>",
    "<S> a striking finding is that the linear - in - mass - ratio piece in the latter tidal factor changes sign in the strong - field domain , to become negative ( while its previously known second post - newtonian approximant was always positive ) . </S>",
    "<S> we , however , argue that this will be more than compensated by a probable fast growth , in the strong - field domain , of the nonlinear - in - mass - ratio contributions in the tidal factor . </S>"
