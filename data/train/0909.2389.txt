    "shape of membranes sensitively changes depending on certain specific environmental conditions such as flow fields , gravity , and thermal fluctuations @xcite .",
    "transformations of the shape , as well as the surface fluctuations , are typical to soft materials such as biological membranes @xcite .",
    "considerable efforts have been given so far to understand these phenomena through statistical mechanical treatments especially from the view point of phase transitions @xcite .",
    "surface models for such phenomena are conventionally defined by using curvature hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "a well - known two - dimensional curvature energy is the so - called helfrich and polyakov hamiltonian , which is rigorously defined by using the notions of two - dimensional differential geometry and plays a role for maintaining the surface shape @xcite .",
    "a linear bending energy in the compartmentalized surfaces can also maintain the surface shape @xcite . a unit tangential vector along the compartment defines the linear bending energy in those compartmentalized models @xcite , while a unit normal vector of the triangles defines the two - dimensional bending energy of helfrich and polyakov in the conventional models @xcite .",
    "thus , we see that the mechanical strength of the surface is always provided by objects defined within the surface geometry such as the linear bending energy and the two - dimensional bending energy",
    ".    on the other hand , director fields are crucial to understand phenomena such as the main transition in liquid crystals including langmuir monolayer @xcite .",
    "the directors represent lipid molecules and can simply be described by the three - dimensional vectors on the surface .",
    "the chirality of membranes is also connected with the tilt of directors @xcite .",
    "the directors align to each others and become ordered at low temperature , while they become disordered at high temperature .",
    "it should also be noted that the directors , unlike the normal vectors of the surface , can not be defined within the surface geometry .",
    "however , it is unclear at present whether the directors maintain the surface shape of membranes and what is the role of the director if it could maintain the surface shape .",
    "therefore , interactions between the director fields and the surface are very interesting and still remain to be studied . we know",
    "that self - avoiding interactions can also maintain the surface shape against the collapse @xcite , however , the collapsing transition of self - avoiding surfaces is very time consuming for numerical studies .    in this paper ,",
    "we investigate whether the surface shape can be maintained only by interactions between the directors and the surface .",
    "the problem we are interested in is whether or not the directors can provide mechanical strength to the surface for maintaining the shape .",
    "two types of bond potentials are examined ; the first is the conventional gaussian bond potential and the second is the nambu - goto potential .",
    "it is well known that the surface model with the nambu - goto potential is ill - defined @xcite , and the model is also ill - defined even when the curvature energy is included in the hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , we check whether the model with director is well - defined when the nambu - goto energy is assumed as the bond potential . moreover , our interest focuses on the phase structure of the model if the surface shape is geometrically well - defined . in that case , it is also interesting to see whether or not the phase structure of the model is different from those of conventional surface models defined by the above mentioned curvature hamiltonians .",
    "the triangulated sphere , where the models are defined , is constructed from the icosahedron and is identical with those in @xcite . by partitioning the icosahedron such that a bond of the icosahedron is split into @xmath0 pieces , we have a triangulated surface of size @xmath1 , in which @xmath2 vertices are of coordination number @xmath3 , and the remaining @xmath4 vertices are of @xmath5 .",

    "we call @xmath23 as the _ director field _ or simply as the _ director_. the symbols @xmath24 in @xmath16 is a unit normal vector of the triangle @xmath25 surrounding the vertex @xmath20 . the definition of @xmath16 in model 2 is identical to that in model 1 .",
    "since @xmath16 is very similar to the bending energy of the first model in @xcite , we call @xmath16 as the bending energy . the director field @xmath23 and the unit normal vectors @xmath24",
    "are shown in fig.[fig-1 ] .",

    "we should note that the nambu - goto energy @xmath15 of eq.([disc - eneg - s1s2 - 2 ] ) makes the model ill - defined if @xmath16 is given by the conventional curvature hamiltonian such that @xmath26 .",
    "it should also be noted that the director energy @xmath16 in eqs.([disc - eneg - s1s2 - 1 ] ) and ( [ disc - eneg - s1s2 - 2 ] ) is not defined within the surface geometry because the director @xmath23 is an external variable of the surface ; it is not constructed without points outside the surface .",
    "for this reason @xmath16 is completely different from the bending energy of the first model in @xcite , although the expressions of @xmath16 in eq.([disc - eneg - s1s2 - 1 ] ) and the bending energy in @xcite are very similar to each other as mentioned above .",
    "we note that the models are symmetric under the transformations such that @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where the normal vector @xmath29 is chosen to have only one of the two - orientations of the surface .",
    "this symmetry implies the existence of the phase transition between two potential minima in the smooth phase .",
    "although the orientation can not change from one to the other in the case of self - avoiding closed surfaces , it can change in our models , which are phantom .",
    "this symmetric property is identical to that of the conventional curvature surface model on the phantom spherical surface , where the model is symmetric under @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , the phase structure of the models in this paper is expected to have the same phase structure as the conventional curvature model .",
    "it should also be noted that the bending energy in this paper is different from the so - called elastic energy @xmath30 of helfrich in @xcite , where @xmath29 is the normal of the surface and @xmath13 is the average orientation of the molecules , and @xmath31 is an elastic modulus .",
    "since @xmath32 can also be written as @xmath33 by using the angle @xmath34 between @xmath29 and @xmath13 , then @xmath32 appears to be equal to @xmath35 in @xmath16 of eqs.([disc - eneg - s1s2 - 1 ] ) and ( [ disc - eneg - s1s2 - 2 ] ) at sufficiently small @xmath34 .",
    "however , @xmath34 is not always constrained to be sufficiently small in this paper .",
    "in fact , the angle @xmath34 in this paper has values in @xmath36 while @xmath13 in @xcite is allowed to have values only in @xmath37 ; this is because the variable @xmath13 in @xcite is assumed to be on the unit half - sphere while @xmath13 in this paper is assumed to be on the whole unit sphere .",
    "the dynamical variables @xmath12 and @xmath13 of the models are integrated out and summed over in the partition function of eq.([part - func ] ) .",
    "the integrations and the summations can be performed by the canonical metropolis monte carlo ( mc ) technique on the triangulated surfaces .",

    "( [ exponent - cx2-n ] ) .     vs. @xmath123 of model 1 and ( b ) the peak values @xmath96 vs. @xmath123 of model 1 in a log - log scale , where @xmath121 in ( a ) and ( b).,width=283 ]    @xmath82 and @xmath96 of model 1 are also shown in figs .",
    "[ fig-13](a ) and [ fig-13](b ) against @xmath123 .",
    "the straight lines are drawn by fitting the largest three data in both of the figures .",
    "thus , we confirm that the conventional scaling properties on the variances of @xmath16 and @xmath97 are almost consistent with the fact that model 1 undergo a first - order transition of surface fluctuations . however , in the case of model 2 we can not always see the scaling property of @xmath82 and @xmath96 in contrast to the case of model 1 in figs . [ fig-13](a ) and [ fig-13](b ) .",
    "the reason of this seems only due to the low statistics of the simulations for model 2 ; the peak positions @xmath93 corresponding to @xmath82 and @xmath96 in figs . [ fig-7](c ) and [ fig-9](c ) are not always consistent with the plots for this scaling .",
    "to summarize , we have investigated a possible mechanism that the directors maintain the surface shape of membranes by using a spherical phantom surface model , which has no curvature hamiltonian .",
    "the directors in the model are analogues of lipid molecules or some external molecules in membranes , whose shape is considered to be crucially dependent on the three - dimensional structure of the molecules .",
    "we focused our attentions on an interaction between the directors and the surface , and the phase structure of the model was studied by using the canonical mc simulation technique .",
    "we should note that the helfrich hamiltonian includes the mean curvature squared term and the gaussian curvature term .",
    "the bending energy in this paper , as well as the conventional bending energy of the type @xmath128 , corresponds to the mean curvature squared term in the helfrich hamiltonian .",
    "the gaussian curvature term is eliminated from the hamiltonian of the model in this paper .",
    "this term seems relevant to the shape of such surfaces with holes , however , it can be neglected in the case of closed surfaces because of the gauss - bonnet theorem @xcite .",
    "two - types of bond potentials are assumed in the model of this paper : the first is the standard gaussian bond potential , which is included in the hamiltonian of model 1 , and the second is the so - called nambu - goto energy , which is defined by the area of the triangles and included in the hamiltonian of model 2 .",
    "both model 1 and model 2 have the bending energy , which describes the interaction between the directors and the surface .",
    "the shape of surface is maintained by this interaction .",
    "we found that both models undergo a first - order collapsing transition between the smooth phase and the collapsed phase .",
    "moreover , a first - order transition of surface fluctuations occurs in the models at the same transition point of the collapsing transition .",
    "one remarkable result is that the model is well - defined even when the hamiltonian includes the nambu - goto energy as the bond potential .",
    "this is confirmed from the numerical results of model 2 . in the case",
    "when the nambu - goto energy is included in the hamiltonian as the bond potential , the conventional curvature surface model becomes ill - defined @xcite .",
    "the phase transitions seen in the models in this paper are relatively strong compared to those of the conventional models , although the order of the transitions is of first - order and hence identical to those of the conventional models .",
    "in fact , the collapsed surface at the transition point is completely collapsed in the models , while the collapsed surface of the conventional model is relatively swollen at the transition point .",
    "consequently , the hausdorff dimension @xmath129 at the collapsed surface is greater than the physical bound , i.e. @xmath73 , in the models of this paper .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the fact @xmath130 in the collapsed phase at the transition point of the conventional curvature surface model @xcite .",
    "we comment on the difference between the bending energy @xmath131 in this paper and the elastic energy @xmath32 in @xcite .",
    "the variable @xmath13 in @xcite has values on the unit half - sphere while @xmath13 in this paper has values on the whole unit sphere .",
    "therefore , the energy @xmath131 in this paper is different from @xmath32 in @xcite , although both energies are almost equal to each other on sufficiently smooth surfaces .    from the numerical results obtained in this paper ,",
    "we conclude that the surface shape of membranes can be maintained by non - surface geometric object such as the directors , which interact with the surface .",
    "important point to note is that the directors are the external variables of the surface .",
    "this implies that the directors are not always identified with the lipid molecules and allows us to speculate as follows : if some external objects could be embedded in the membrane so as to have the assumed interaction with the membrane constituents , the surface shape can be controlled .",
    "it is interesting to study the phase structure of the fluid surface model with the directors .",
    "correlations between the directors can be assumed as an energy term for maintaining the surface shape ; we expect that the surface shape is maintained by the correlation energy .",
