    "the problem of interacting electrons moving in one dimension has attracted considerable attention since the early theoretical formulations of tomonaga @xcite and luttinger @xcite .",
    "the motivation for the continuous activity in this field has been twofold .",
    "first , this system offers a concrete realization of various non - fermi liquid phenomena and is amenable to controlled theoretical treatments . as",
    "such it constitutes a unique theoretical laboratory for studying strong correlations .",
    "secondly , in addition to the existence of various quasi - one - dimensional compounds such as organic bachgaard salts @xcite and inorganic purple bronzes @xcite , there is a growing set of higher dimensional systems whose experimentally observed behavior appears to be , nevertheless , quasi - one - dimensional . among them",
    "one finds the high temperature superconductors @xcite , the manganites @xcite and quantum hall systems @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the electronic structure of these materials is actually quasi - one - dimensional on a local scale .",
    "the overwhelming majority of the studies of one - dimensional systems that have been carried out so far have assumed that the electrons move along static straight chains .",
    "a notable exception is the study of the smectic phase in quantum hall samples @xcite .",
    "this theory presupposes the existence of a unidirectional charge density wave in the sample and focuses on the quantum mechanical description of the fluctuating chiral edge channels that develop on the boundaries between regions of different filling fraction .",
    "each channel is characterized by a displacement field @xmath5 , representing the transverse displacement of the edge from its classical ground state position ( taken to be along the @xmath6 axis ) , and a luttinger field @xmath7 , describing the phase of the electronic charge density modulation along the edge . in this problem the two",
    "are coupled through the term @xmath8 , which in the gauge @xmath9 , and using the fact that the edge current is @xmath10 translates into @xmath11 . as a result @xmath5 and @xmath7",
    "are canonically conjugated and thus do not constitute independent degrees of freedom .",
    "this is a fundamental difference between the quantum hall edge and the problem of spinful interacting electrons on a fluctuating string which this paper explores .    while the model of interacting electrons on a dynamical one - dimensional geometry possesses an independent theoretical appeal , we are particularly motivated by its possible relevancy to the physics of doped mott insulators @xcite .",
    "there is evidence that over a wide range of the phase diagram of these systems the doped holes spontaneously segregate into one - dimensional charged stripes which also form domain walls across which the background spin texture undergoes a @xmath12-phase shift .    in some instances",
    "the observed stripe order is static , at least on the time scale of the experimental probe .",
    "elastic neutron diffraction measurements revealed static spin and charge stripe order in the quasi - two - dimensional insulating nickelate @xcite and in the isostructural system @xcite .",
    "similar results were obtained @xcite for the non - superconducting relative of the high - temperature superconductors .",
    "the charge order has since been confirmed by high - energy x - ray diffraction @xcite .",
    "systems that exhibit static stripe order are typically insulators or bad conductors and stripe fluctuations seem to play an important role in turning them into superconductors . in the superconducting material",
    "the magnetic ordering temperature , @xmath13 , and the superconducting transition temperature , @xmath14 , are anti - correlated @xcite .",
    "for example , around @xmath15 where stripes are particularly stable , @xmath13 reaches a maximum while @xmath14 exhibits a substantial dip .",
    "the same effect has been observed in @xcite .",
    "static magnetic stripe signatures exist in the insulating spin - glass phase of the nd - free with @xmath16 @xcite and also in the underdoped superconducting region @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "however , near optimal doping and in the overdoped regime ( @xmath18 ) , where quantum fluctuations are presumably larger , static ordering is averted and only dynamical stripe correlations have been found by inelastic neutron scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "evidence for slowly fluctuating spin and charge order has also been detected in underdoped superconducting @xcite .",
    "qualitative arguments and several estimates of the impact of stripes fluctuations on the inter - stripe couplings and the resulting phase diagram of the many - stripe system have been presented in ref .",
    "[ kferef ] . while the present paper does not deal with questions concerning the physics that emerges from such couplings its purpose is to establish a quantum description of the single fluctuating one - dimensional electron gas as a basis for tackling these issues at a later stage .    in sec .",
    "[ model ] we introduce a model of interacting electrons which are constrained to move on a fluctuating elastic string .",
    "we show how this constraint leads to a change in the metric and to the coupling of the electronic dynamics to effective scalar and vector potentials , which are determined by the string fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the model is then quantized and bosonized in sec .",
    "[ quantization ] .",
    "the electronic correlation functions of the resulting low - energy theory are calculated in sec .",
    "[ correlations ] by integrating out the string degrees of freedom under the assumption that it is stiff and massive .",
    "this assumption enables us to generate a perturbative expansion in the inverse string tension and mass density .",
    "as long as one is concerned with correlations of order parameters which are projected on the line defined by the string equilibrium configuration the results are of the usual luttinger type .",
    "the effects of fluctuations enter through the renormalization of the exponents of the power - laws that describe such correlations .",
    "if the number of particles is held fixed this renormalization is mainly due to the increase of the average length of the string by its fluctuations .",
    "consequently the relative strength of the interactions between particles is increased compared to their kinetic energy .",
    "if on the other hand a constant particle density along the string is maintained this effect is absent and the renormalization is dominated by the attractive interaction induced by the exchange of elastic string waves .    more generally , however , the correlation functions depend on the position in the embedding plane , or equivalently , in fourier space , on both the wave - vector component along the string axis , @xmath19 , and its component in the perpendicular direction @xmath20 .",
    "an example is the single - hole spectral function . under certain conditions",
    "we find that it retains its luttinger liquid structure in terms of @xmath19 and the frequency @xmath21 but with interaction parameters which are increasing functions of the momentum component @xmath20 along the one - dimensional fermi surface .",
    "this effect also leads to a weak logarithmic suppression of the tunneling density of states in addition to the renormalization of its power - law exponent as discussed above .",
    "when the string fluctuates electrical current may flow in the @xmath22 direction either because electrons are being dragged by the string or because charge flows along segments of the string which are at an angle to the @xmath6 axis .",
    "the first process gives rise to a drude - peak in the @xmath22 component of the optical conductivity whose weight is smaller relative to the corresponding peak in @xmath23 , by the ratio of the electronic and string mass densities .",
    "the second process results in a contribution which is linear in @xmath21 and whose oscillator strength is further reduced in comparison to the drude peak .",
    "however , this contribution survives even if the string is pinned and can not execute rigid translations , while the peak does not .",
    "we end section [ correlations ] with a brief consideration of the effects of placing the string inside a harmonic confining potential .",
    "as expected the potential predominantly sets a cross - over scale below which correlations are the same as of a regular luttinger liquid .    finally , in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] , we discuss few possible applications of our findings to measurements of the cuprate high temperature superconductors .",
    "we consider electrons that are constrained to move on a stretchable one - dimensional fluctuating string , embedded in a two - dimensional plane .",
    "we assume that the projection of the string on the @xmath6 axis is of fixed length , @xmath24 , and that it obeys periodic boundary conditions along this direction .",
    "we consider the limit of a stiff and massive string whose characteristic quantum and thermal fluctuations are smooth on the length - scale of any short distance cutoff associated with its dynamics , for example the lattice spacing , @xmath25 , in the case of stripes in doped mott insulators .",
    "this assumption allows us to work in the continuum limit and to ignore overhangs .",
    "consequently we describe the string using a function , @xmath26 , with @xmath27 , which represents its transverse oscillations relative to the string classical equilibrium configuration , which we take to be along the @xmath6 axis .",
    "the string is characterized by two parameters : the linear mass density , @xmath28 , and the tension , @xmath29 . in the case where the string models a stripe , @xmath28 is determined by the kinetic energy per unit length of the domain wall while @xmath29 is given by the energy to create a unit length of the domain wall inside the mott insulator .",
    "the string lagrangian is therefore [ l_s ] l_s&=&_0^l_x dx + & & _ 0^l_x dx , where [ u ] u= , is the sound velocity on the string .",
    "the linearized approximation of the action is valid as long as the short distance cutoff for the string fluctuations @xcite , which we denote by , @xmath25 , is large compared to the length scale @xmath30 set by its parameters ( here and throughout the paper we take @xmath31 . ) assuming that this condition holds we will use it below to carry out a perturbative calculation of the effective electronic action in the small dimensionless parameter [ epsilon ] = ( ) ^2= .",
    "this can be interpreted as the average ( squared ) slope of the string relative to its equilibrium configuration or as the average fluctuations - induced local dilatation of the string , since @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the length element along the string .",
    "next we consider the @xmath34 electrons that move on the string .",
    "the position of the @xmath35-th electron is given by its cartesian coordinates in the plane [ r_i ] ( t)=[x_i(t),y_i(t)]=[x_i(t),y(x_i(t),t ) ] , where the last equality expresses the constraint that confines the particles to the string .",
    "its velocity is given by [ v_i ] = = , which demonstrates that the electrons change their position in the plane either by moving along the string or by being dragged by it in the @xmath22-direction .",
    "including the coupling of the particles to an external electromagnetic field , with scalar potential @xmath36 and vector potential @xmath37 , the electronic lagrangian is given by [ l_e1 ] l_e=&&_i=1^n_e + & & -_ij=1^n_ev(|-| ) , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the electronic mass and charge respectively , and @xmath40 is the pair interaction , which in the following we take to be short ranged . using relations ( [ r_i ] ) and ( [ v_i ] ) this lagrangian can also be written as [ l_e2 ] l_e=&&_i=1^n_e g(x_i , t)()^2 + & & + _",
    "i=1^n_e + & & -_ij=1^n_ev(x_i , x_j ) , where [ g ] g(x , t)=1+()^2 , is the metric induced by the string in the coordinate system of the @xmath41s .",
    "the string fluctuations also participate in determining the effective gauge potentials for the @xmath41 degrees of freedom [ aeff ] _ 0(x , t)=&&()^2 + & & + a_0[x , y(x , t),t ] - a_y[x , y(x , t),t ] , + _",
    "1(x , t)=&&- + & & + a_x[x , y(x , t),t ] + a_y[x , y(x , t),t ] .",
    "finally the pair interaction is [ vpair ] v(x , x)=v ( ) .",
    "equations ( [ l_e2])-([vpair ] ) establish a description of the electronic physics in cartesian coordinates .",
    "although simple in appearance this formulation poses difficulties when one attempts to quantize the model .",
    "the source of the problem is the space - time dependence of the metric that appears in the kinetic term of the lagrangian .",
    "upon quantization it leads to operator ordering ambiguities .",
    "in order to circumvent this problem we parameterize the positions of the particles on the string using the arc - length variable [ arc ] ( x , t)=_0^x",
    "dx . denoting by @xmath42 the position of the @xmath35-th particle along the string",
    "we find [ xtol ] = , where [ partiall ] ( x , t)=_0^x dx . in terms of the new coordinates the electronic lagrangian appears as [ newl_e ] l_e=&&_i=1^n_e + & & -_ij=1^n_e v[x(_i),x(_j ) ] , and the gauge potentials are [ newa ] _ 0(,t)=&&a_0[x(),t]+ ( [ x(),t])^2 + & & + [ x(),t]a_1[x(),t ] , + _ 1(,t)= & & [ x(),t]+_1[x(),t ] .    in this form",
    "the problem reduces to a system of particles in flat 1 + 1 space - time ( whose spatial extent is time dependent ) which interact with each other via the pair potential @xmath40 and couple to the gauge potentials @xmath43 , which are functions of the string configuration @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "the price we pay for the simple form of the kinetic term is the fact that these gauge potentials are non - local since they are functions of @xmath45 defined in eq .",

    "we are still considering the string degrees of freedom as a classical field .    despite its apparent simplicity the formulation of the problem in the arc - length parameterization , eq .",
    "( [ h_eq ] ) , suffers from two significant shortcomings .",
    "the first is the non - local nature of the gauge potentials @xmath51 .",
    "the second problem stems from the fact that experiments measure the electronic correlation functions as functions of the coordinates in the embedding plane and not of the arc - length along the string .",
    "it is therefore desirable to rewrite the theory in terms of the projected coordinate @xmath6 .",
    "it turns out that by doing so one also remedy the first difficulty .    to this end",

    "notwithstanding , we hope that the model captures at least some of the features associated with the relevant stripe physics .      one such feature , which is revealed by the model , is the tendency of the holes to enhance the flexibility of the string in order to increase its fluctuations and by that the gain in their kinetic energy .",
    "we believe that this is also the driving force behind stripe fluctuations in the coper - oxygen planes , where holes hop in the transverse direction to the stripe in order to lower their kinetic energy .",
    "as we have shown , as long as the number of electrons is fixed , an increase in the string fluctuations leads to an increase in the relative strength of the electron - electron interactions as reflected by the luttinger parameters @xmath177 , eq .",
    "( [ k ] ) . this fact may carry with it consequences to the size of the pseudogap which is observed , especially in underdoped samples@xcite .",

    "[ spingapref ] . in this scenario two coupled one - dimensional systems with different fermi wave - vectors are considered , modeling the stripe and its environment .",
    "single particle tunneling between the systems is suppressed owing to the difference in their fermi wave - vectors . however , under appropriate circumstances singlet pair - tunneling processes can become relevant . when this happens the coupled system scales to a new strong coupling fixed point which exhibits a total spin gap and strong global superconducting fluctuations .",
    "the physics is analogous to the proximity effect in conventional superconductors since both are driven by the gain in the zero point kinetic energy of the pairs which outweighs the cost of pairing .",
    "the relevancy of the pair - tunneling term is governed by its scaling dimension _",

    "in particular they are decreasing functions of @xmath86 .",
    "pair tunneling is perturbatively relevant if @xmath181 and irrelevant otherwise .",
    "intra - stripe repulsive interactions ( @xmath182 ) increase the value of @xmath183 , thus making it less relevant .",
    "this is physically reasonable since repulsive interactions within the stripe are unfavorable for pairing and therefore for pair tunneling .",
    "since stripe fluctuations have the effect of decreasing the value of @xmath86 , see eq .",
    "( [ k ] ) , they tend to increase the scaling dimension @xmath183 and thus reduce the effectiveness of the spin - gap proximity effect .",
    "since there is experimental evidence that correlates between higher levels of doping and a greater degree of stripe fluctuations this would mean that fluctuations may account , at least partially , for the decrease in the pseudogap with doping .    here",
    "it should be noted , however , that fluctuations have additional effects on the josephson coupling between stripes . as this coupling involves tunneling of pairs from one system to another it is governed by the points of closest approach between them . since fluctuations increase the probability of having the two systems in close proximity the amplitude of such tunneling processes is exponentially enhanced by them@xcite .",
    "in addition it has been shown that inter - stripe forward scattering interactions tend to increase the relevance of pair tunneling@xcite .",
    "such interactions arise naturally when integrating out the shape fluctuations in coupled chain systems .    which of the three effects just mentioned dominates the physics is a matter of details .",
    "it is possible that in the spin - gap proximity effect , in which pairs do not have to tunnel through an intervening barrier and where the forward scattering interactions induced by the fluctuations are second order in @xmath83 , the reduction in the kinetic energy along the stripe is the most important , at least for small fluctuations .",
    "it is also likely that for the establishment of global phase coherence in a quasi - one - dimensional superconductor through josephson tunneling between stripes the increase of the tunneling amplitude due to fluctuations is the major effect .",
    "arpes measurements provide indirect evidence for the existence of stripes in the cuprate compounds @xcite .",
    "for instance , measurements @xcite of and the related materials @xcite and have revealed that the frequency - integrated spectral weight is confined inside one - dimensional segments in momentum space .",
    "these segments can be interpreted as the fermi surfaces of quarter - filled one - dimensional stripes running along the @xmath25 and @xmath184 directions in the planes .",
    "the spectral function @xmath129 , which is measured by arpes , is often a broad function of the frequency @xmath21 , especially in the vicinity of the anti - nodal points @xmath185 , @xmath186 .",
    "this behavior is naturally explained @xcite if one considers the signal as coming from a collection of one - dimensional systems which are capable of producing such wide spectra for a large enough interaction strength [ large enough values of @xmath163 , see eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) ] .    the width of any @xmath21 structure in @xmath129 typically becomes smaller as one moves from the anti - nodal regions toward the @xmath187-point @xmath188 or the nodal regions around @xmath189 .",
    "this tendency is ubiquitous and appears in various systems , for example @xcite . within the interpretation of the two - dimensional fermi surface as being a superposition of two fermi surfaces of one - dimensional stripes ,",
    "the anti - nodal regions correspond to wave - vectors with a large component in the direction perpendicular to the stripes .",
    "we have seen that the effects of stripes fluctuations tend to increase , via the term @xmath190 , the value of the exponent that governs the behavior of the spectral function , eqs .",
    "( [ equalv],[spinrotinv ] ) .",
    "this enhancement grows with the magnitude of the transverse wave - vector component , @xmath20 , and leads to broader spectra .",
    "it may constitute at least a partial reason for the observed broad spectra in the anti - nodal regions .",
    "we have shown that stripe fluctuations lead to an anisotropy in the optical conductivity , eqs .",
    "( [ misigmaxx],[misigmayy ] ) , whose size is inversely proportional to the degree of fluctuations as given by the parameter @xmath83 .",
