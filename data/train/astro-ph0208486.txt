    "extremely red objects ( eros ) have been the subject of many studies since their discovery ( e.g. , cowie et al .  1990 ; hu & ridgway 1994 ) .",
    "two scenarios can explain the unusally red colors of the eros : old stellar populations at @xmath13 ( e.g. , dunlop et al .",

    "smith et al .",
    "the starlight from dusty galaxies is reprocessed and reemitted in the rest wavelength far - infrared band . for high redshift sources ,",
    "this light is redshifted into the submillimeter . recently ,",
    "a number of possible ero counterparts to submillimeter detected sources have been discovered ( e.g. , smail et al .  1999 , 2002 ; barger , cowie , & richards 2000 ; ivison et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the _ cobe _ satellite found that the submillimeter extragalactic background light ( ebl ) has approximately the same integrated energy density as the optical ebl ( puget et al .",
    "1996 ; fixsen et al .",
    "1998 ) ; thus , a large fraction of starlight is reradiated by dust . to determine the high - redshift star formation , the sources that comprise the submillimeter ebl need to be determined .",
    "here we use deep submillimeter and near - infrared ( nir ) imaging of three massive lensing cluster fields to determine the submillimeter properties of the ero population .",
    "two advantages of observing cluster fields are that background sources are magnified and mean source separations on the sky are increased .    in   [ secdata ]",
    "we briefly describe our @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath0 , and 850  @xmath3 m data .",
    "the @xmath16 beam size of scuba ( holland et al .",
    "1999 ) on the 15  m james clerk maxwell telescope prohibits us from making individual matches between submillimeter and optical / nir sources .",
    "however , in   [ secebl ] we analyze our data statistically and find that eros , as a class , have a significant submillimeter flux and produce much of the 850  @xmath3 m ebl . in ",
    "[ secfaint ] we use our nir photometry and lensing corrections to calculate the ero surface densities to @xmath17 .",
    "we analyze where in @xmath0 magnitude the 850  @xmath3 m flux arises . using the @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath0 colors",
    ", we differentiate between evolved galaxies and dust - reddened starbursts to show that the 850  @xmath3 m light primarily arises in the latter class of object .",
    "we constructed @xmath0 catalogs for our three cluster fields using data obtained with the cooled infrared spectrograph and camera for ohs ( cisco ; motohara et al .",
    "1998 ) on the subaru 8.2  m telescope .",
    "the detector is a @xmath18 hgcdte hawaii array with a @xmath19 pixel scale and an @xmath20 field - of - view .",
    "the @xmath0 exposures are 15.4  ks ( a370 ) , 3.84  ks ( a851 ) , and 15.4  ks ( a2390 ) .",
    "@xmath15-band data were also obtained with the same instrument .",

    "the image quality of the @xmath0 images is @xmath21 fwhm .",
    "we used @xmath0 magnitudes measured in @xmath22 diameter apertures to determine colors , and we used isophotal magnitudes to 2% of the peak surface brightness for total magnitudes .",
    "we estimated the noise in the images by measuring aperture magnitudes at a number of blank sky positions .",
    "the @xmath23 limit for the shallowest of the fields is @xmath24 ; we adopt this limit for the entire @xmath0 sample selection .",
    "we measured @xmath22 diameter aperture @xmath14-band magnitudes for the @xmath0 samples from images obtained with either the low - resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; oke et al .",
    "1995 ) or the echellette spectrograph and imager ( esi ; epps & miller 1998 ) on the keck 10  m telescopes .",
    "the data are described in cowie et al .",
    "( 2001 ; a370 and a2390 ) and smail et al .",
    "( 1999 ; a851 ) .",
    "the @xmath25 limit for the shallowest of the fields is @xmath26 ; we adopt this limit for the entire sample .    finally , we measured 850  @xmath3 m fluxes at the @xmath0 source positions from ultradeep scuba jiggle maps .",
    "we used beam - weighted extraction routines that include both the positive and negative portions of the beam profile .",
    "the total exposure times are 133.1  ks ( a370 ) , 59.3  ks ( a851 ) , and 78.1  ks ( a2390 )",
    ". the @xmath27 sensitivities , including both fainter sources and correlated noise , are 0.45  mjy ( a370 ) , 0.87  mjy ( a851 ) , and 0.71  mjy ( a2390 ) .",
    "the data are described in cowie , barger , & kneib ( 2002 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the @xmath28 versus @xmath0 color - magnitude diagram .",
    "most of the sources are cluster members .",
    "the cluster color - magnitude relationship is clearly visible and matches the measured relations for clusters at these redshifts ( e.g. , kodama et al .",
    "thirty - eight galaxies have @xmath1 , classifying them as eros , and fifty - five have @xmath29 .",
    "we classify galaxies with @xmath7 as very red objects ( vros ) .",
    "the 11.5  arcmin@xmath30 area covered by the @xmath0 data is somewhat smaller than the 18.9  arcmin@xmath30 area covered by the submillimeter data .",
    "a disproportionate number of the eros and vros lie in the a2390 cluster field ( 26 of the 38 sources with @xmath1 , and 32 of the 55 sources with @xmath29 ) .",
    "the excess may be associated with a very high - redshift , evolved cluster lying behind a2390 , as we discuss in   [ secfaint ] .",
    "the @xmath16 scuba beam size means that we can not be certain which @xmath0-selected galaxy is the true counterpart to a submillimeter source .",
    "however , by determining the error - weighted mean 850  @xmath3 m flux of the @xmath0 sources , we can make statistically significant statements regarding the relationship between submillimeter flux and source color .",
    "this is analogous to what peacock et al .",
    "( 2000 ) did for optical starbursts .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a we plot submillimeter flux versus @xmath28 color , and in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b we plot error - weighted mean 850  @xmath3 m flux per color bin .",
    "because submillimeter sources are not removed from the jiggle maps , the complex beam profile produced by the nod and chop observing pattern ( there are twice as many negative as positive response points , but at half the sensitivity ) means that the submillimeter flux distribution is non - gaussian with an extended negative tail .",
    "a negative submillimeter flux will be measured for a @xmath0-selected source positioned in the negative portion of the beam profile corresponding to a submillimeter source .",
    "thus , there are more high negative flux measurements in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a than would be expected based on a simple gaussian model with the quoted errors .",
    "the average signal of a set of random sources should , however , be zero , and the significance of the result can be determined from sets of monte carlo simulations of the same number of points randomly distributed in the fields ( more details can be found in cowie et al .",
    "2002 ) .    at low values of @xmath28",
    "the error - weighted mean 850  @xmath3 m fluxes are consistent with zero ; however , as @xmath28 increases , there is a corresponding increase in the means ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2]b ) .",
    "the @xmath1 galaxies have an error - weighted mean of @xmath31 mjy .",
    "the formal error is based on the assumption of gaussian statistics and may underestimate the true error , but the result is highly significant : 10000 monte carlo simulations yielded only one case where the same number of randomly positioned objects had a value equal or above the observed value .",
    "we tested whether the signal is arising from a small number of objects by eliminating the positive and negative tails : if the two ( five ) most positive and two ( five ) most negative sources are removed from the @xmath1 sample , the signal becomes @xmath32  mjy ( @xmath33  mjy ) .",
    "the @xmath1 objects in the a2390 field have a value of @xmath34  mjy , while those in the a370 and a851 fields have a value of @xmath35  mjy , so the mean submillimeter flux per ero is consistent , even if we break down the sample .",
    "the @xmath7 galaxies have an error - weighted mean of @xmath8 mjy ; here 10000 simulations yielded only 85 cases with values at or above this level .",
    "since the sky surface brightness is conserved by the lensing process , we find the ero population contributes @xmath5  mjy  deg@xmath6 to the 850  @xmath3 m ebl .",
    "this value is @xmath36 percent of the total 850  @xmath3 m ebl if the puget et al .  ( 1996 ) value of @xmath37  mjy  deg@xmath6 is assumed , or @xmath38 percent if the fixsen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) value of @xmath39  mjy  deg@xmath6 is assumed .",
    "when the galaxies with @xmath7 are included , the contribution increases to @xmath9  mjy  deg@xmath6 ( 83 or 59 percent of the total , respectively ) .",
    "thus , the majority of the 850  @xmath3 m ebl arises from the relatively small number of sources with @xmath29 .",
    "however , there may be systematic errors arising from clustering .",
    "for the individual fields , the ebl contributions from the @xmath29 sources are @xmath40  mjy  deg@xmath6 ( a370 ) , @xmath41  mjy  deg@xmath6 ( a851 ) , and @xmath42  mjy  deg@xmath6 ( a2390 ) .",
    "although a2390 has the largest number of @xmath29 objects ( see   [ secfaint ] ) , a851 has a higher mean submillimeter signal per object .",
    "if we exclude a2390 because of the anomalously high number of red objects in this field , then the @xmath29 population contributes @xmath43  mjy  deg@xmath6 to the 850  @xmath3 m ebl .",
    "while the @xmath29 populations in all three cluster fields are significantly detected , it is clear that a large number of fields would have to be averaged to produce a high precision estimate of the ebl contribution , and the systematic errors in the present estimate may be as high as a factor of 2 .",
    "we now analyze the ero number counts to determine how representative our fields are and to estimate the ero surface densities to fainter magnitudes than has previously been possible .",
    "the methodology used is described in more detail in smith et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , who analyzed 10 cluster fields observed to shallower @xmath44 limits .",
    "we used the lenstool software package to determine the amplifications of the eros , assuming they were located at @xmath45 .",
    "( the amplification varies only weakly with redshift for any source beyond @xmath46 that has a modest amplification . )",
    "lenstool uses multiple - component mass distributions that describe the extended potential wells of the clusters and their more massive individual member galaxies ( kneib et al .",
    "details for the a370 , a851 , and a2390 clusters can be found in kneib et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , seitz et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and j .-",
    "kneib et al . , in preparation , respectively .",
    "we also used lenstool to determine the areas in the source plane over which an object with a given source plane magnitude would be seen .",
    "we created grids the size of our cluster field @xmath0 images with @xmath47 grid elements and treated the grid points as objects in the source plane at @xmath45 .",
    "we brought the grids through the cluster mass distributions to determine the magnifications at each point .",
    "since each point represents one square arcsecond , the associated source plane area for a given magnitude is the sum of the points where an object of that magnitude could be detected .    to compute the ero surface densities , we summed the reciprocals of the associated areas for all the sources in each magnitude bin .",
    "( multiply imaged sources are correctly handled since the source plane area is proportionally increased relative to the number of images . )",
    "the results are shown in fig",
    ".  [ fig3 ] , where surface density per square degree per magnitude is plotted versus lensing - corrected ( i.e. , source plane ) isophotal @xmath0 magnitude .",
    "the fact that fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] flattens at faint magnitudes indicates that by @xmath17 we have already seen most of the @xmath0 light density in the ero population .    at brighter @xmath0",
    "magnitudes our surface densities are higher than those determined by smith et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and by previous blank field surveys ( e.g. , barger et al .  1999 ; daddi et al .",
    "to @xmath48 we find a cumulative surface density of 8.0 ( 6.6 , 9.4 ) eros per square arcminute , where the parentheses show the @xmath27 limits .",
    "this is slightly more than three times the smith et al .",
    "value of @xmath49 arcmin@xmath6 .",
    "( our @xmath50 criterion is very similar to their @xmath51 criterion . )",
    "the reason for the excess lies in the large population of eros in the a2390 field , where the surface density is 19.7 ( 15.6 , 23.8 ) arcmin@xmath6 to @xmath48 .",
    "if we restrict our analysis to the a370 and a851 cluster fields ( the open diamonds in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , the surface density drops to 3.4 ( 2.3 , 4.8 ) arcmin@xmath6 to @xmath48 , which is comparable to the smith et al .  value .",
    "inspection of the @xmath0 image of a2390 suggests that the ero excess in this field corresponds to a cluster of galaxies centered on a bright red galaxy in the northwest corner of the image ; this galaxy is an x - ray point source ( fabian et al .",
    "2000 ) with a spectroscopic redshift of @xmath52 ( cowie et al .",
    "a second x - ray source in the southwest corner has a similar probable spectroscopic redshift ( cowie et al . ) .",
    "if we assume that the excess of eros is associated with this cluster , then the cluster contains roughly 20 eros to @xmath48 , making it an extremely large concentration of evolved galaxies at this redshift .",
    "the error - weighted mean 850  @xmath3 m flux per source decreases ( though slower than linearly ) with increasing source plane @xmath0 magnitude : at mean @xmath0 magnitudes of ( 16.9 , 18.8 , 20.6 , 22.4 ) we find error - weighted mean 850  @xmath3 m fluxes of ( @xmath53 )  mjy .",
    "although submillimeter flux depends only weakly on redshift , such that higher redshift sources fade in @xmath0 but not in 850  @xmath3 m flux , sources that are fainter in @xmath0 luminosity may be intrinsically fainter in 850  @xmath3 m luminosity .",
    "the dependence of 850  @xmath3 m flux on ero @xmath0 magnitude means that brighter submillimeter surveys are more likely to identify ero counterparts .",
    "the observed decrease in 850  @xmath3 m flux with increasing @xmath0 magnitude , combined with the flatness of the ero counts at the fainter magnitudes seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , implies that the largest contribution to the 850  @xmath3 m ebl arises near the point at which the ero number counts begin to flatten ",
    "around @xmath54 . in the present data half of the 850  @xmath3 m light arises in sources with source plane magnitudes @xmath10 , and half arises in fainter sources , placing the median 850  @xmath3 m source at @xmath54 .",
    "if a2390 , with its larger number of bright eros , is excluded , the split occurs at @xmath55 .",
    "when sources fainter than @xmath17 are included , the split will occur at a fainter magnitude , but the effect will be small .    we may also try to determine if the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of the sources correlate with the 850  @xmath3 m fluxes . if the 850  @xmath3 m signal arises primarily from dust - reddened starbursts rather than from old elliptical galaxies , then we would expect objects with a smoother nir sed to be the primary source of the signal .",
    "( the red @xmath28 colors of old evolved galaxies are in large part due to the 4000    break , which produces a discontinuity in the nir seds . ) as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we have used the criterion @xmath56 to separate redder @xmath11 galaxies that follow the unevolved elliptical galaxy track from bluer @xmath11 galaxies that lie in the dust - reddened starburst region ( see pozzetti & mannucci 2000 for other color selection criteria ) .",
    "sources in the starburst region could also be more recently formed galaxies or galaxies with some residual star formation .    of the 55 galaxies with @xmath29 in our sample ,",
    "39 have measured @xmath15 magnitudes .",
    "the error - weighted mean 850  @xmath3 m flux for all 39 objects is @xmath57  mjy .",
    "the 17 ( 44 percent ) that satisfy the elliptical galaxy criterion have @xmath58  mjy .",
    "in contrast , the 22 that lie on the dusty starburst side have @xmath59  mjy . thus",
    ", the bulk of the signal does appear to arise in the smaller number of galaxies that could be dusty starbursts .",
    "from an optical , nir , and submillimeter survey of three massive lensing cluster fields we find that vros and eros mark , on average , strong submillimeter emitters .",
    "the @xmath29 population contributes @xmath43  mjy  deg@xmath6 to the 850  @xmath3 m ebl if we exclude the a2390 field because of the anomalously high number of red objects , and @xmath60  mjy  deg@xmath6 if we include the a2390 field .",
    "these contributions are , respectively , @xmath61 percent and @xmath62 percent of the 850  @xmath3 m ebl ( the ranges depend on the measurement of the ebl assumed ) and are much larger than the @xmath63 percent from galaxies containing bright agn ( barger et al .",
    "ero clustering is an important effect that must be accounted for if we are to obtain a better estimate .",
    "the median magnitude of the sources giving rise to the ebl is @xmath54 to @xmath55 , depending on the cluster sample used .",
    "the 850  @xmath3 m ebl contribution primarily arises in the subset of the population corresponding to dusty starbursts .",
