    "cen  a , the closest massive elliptical galaxy , the nearest recent merger , and one of the nearest galaxies with a significantly active nucleus provides a unique laboratory to probe the interconnection between these phenomena on scales that are contained in the central resolution element in any other object of its kind .",

    "this is the largest offset from the relation measured to date .",
    "it is important to check this value , since it can help us to understand the coevolution of black holes and their surrounding bulges in more detail .",
    "+ we have initiated a program to study the central parsec of cen  a using naos / conica @xcite at the very large telescope ( vlt ) . the adaptive - optics assisted imager and spectrograph provides us with near infrared data from 1 to 5 @xmath10 m at the diffraction limit of a 8 m class telescope .",

    "there are no potential reference stars bright enough ( @xmath1314 mag ) for the wavefront correction at a distance of @xmath14 to the nucleus , necessary for a good quality of correction at the nucleus .",
    "therefore , we directly guided on the nucleus itself using the unique ir wavefront sensor implemented in naos .",
    "this strategy provides us the best possible wavefront correction in the vicinity of the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "in fact we reach the diffraction limit of the vlt in k - band of fwhm @xmath15 and are not far off in h - band with @xmath16 . during the observations the atmospheric conditions were stable and the performance of the ir wavefront sensor ( wfs ) was steadily very good . for observations in h - band we used the k - dichroic , i.e. all the nuclear k - band light for wavefront correction . while observing in k - band itself the only possibility to achieve a good performance of the wfs was to send 90% of the light to naos and only 10% to conica ( i.e. use the n90c10 dichroic ) .",
    "this increases the exposure times by a factor of 10 and made it effectively impossible to go for spectroscopy in k - band .",
    "for the imaging we chose the strategy to jitter the field on five positions at a separation of 4@xmath12 and take a sky image at a dark position in the dust lane at a distance of @xmath17170@xmath12 south - east of the nucleus ; this cycle was repeated 4 times .",

    "the dispersion was 7.0 @xmath25 pixel@xmath2 , yielding a resolution of r=1500 in h. at a given position angle , the observations went as follows : first , the loop for adaptive optics correction was closed .",
    "when a good performance of the wfs was reached , an acquisition image in h - band was taken .",
    "the slit was centered on the prominent nuclear peak with an accuracy of @xmath26pixel ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the actual observations consisted of two sequences of exposures at 4 positions along the slit .",
    "this was done in order to perform sky subtraction and to avoid detector defects .",
    "the effective slit length is @xmath28 .",
    "the exposure time per frame was 300  s , leading to a total exposure time of 40  min per slit position angle .",
    "+ data reduction was performed using standard iraf routines .",
    "the frames were first bias corrected and flat - fielded with spectroscopic lamp - flats . then cosmic rays were rejected and the frames were wavelength calibrated and corrected for distortions using spectroscopic arc lamps . + to get the final 2-d spectrum the frames were aligned .",
    "this is done by shifting all frames to the same nuclear position .",
    "finally , the frames were sorted by quality of wavefront correction , using both the width of the peak and the level of continuum flux .",
    "+      a difficult but crucial part of adaptive optics observations is the assessment of the point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "the psf is highly dependent on the quality of the wavefront correction , quantified e.g. by the strehl ratio .",
    "the strehl ratio is set by the observable properties of the reference object ( flux , size , contrast ) but also by the atmospheric conditions ( seeing , coherence time ) ; it is therefore changing with time and needs to be monitored throughout the observations . in case of the k - band image a separate psf reference star was observed directly after the nucleus with the same wfs setup .",
    "this star was chosen from the 2mass point source catalogue @xcite to match cen  a s nucleus as closely as possible : in angular proximity , magnitude and color .",
    "since the acquisition for naco observations takes a non - negligible amount of time , going back and forth to the psf star is a tedious and time - consuming task . on the other hand the measurement of a separate psf - star at a given difference in time and position on the sky does not guarantee to give a good approximation on the actual on - source psf .",
    "we therefore came to the conclusion that it is most suitable to measure the psf in the science frame on the unresolved nucleus .    for emission line",
    "spectroscopy the strategy is to have the nucleus in the slit at all position angles and measure the psf on this unresolved point - source for each frame .",
    "we tested this approach by choosing one position angle ( p.a.@xmath29 ) such that the nucleus plus a foreground star are simultaneously observed , and indeed , the widths of both light profiles are similar ( compare table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "we describe the normalized psf empirically by a sum of two gaussians ; one narrow component describing the corrected / almost diffraction limited psf core ( @xmath30 ) and one broader component which we later attribute to the seeing halo ( @xmath31 ) : @xmath32 where f is the ratio of the flux of the narrow component and the total flux of the psf ( f = @xmath33 ) .",
    "the quantity f provides a rough approximation of the strehl ratio ( s ) which gives the quality of an optical system ; s is defined as the observed peak flux divided by the theoretically expected peak flux of the airy disk for the optical system ( s = @xmath34 ) . for the following analysis",
    "it is sufficient to measure the quantity f , which also gives an estimate of the quality of the adaptive optics correction .",
    "+ the width of the fitted broad component can be compared with the seeing that is given in the header for each frame , as measured by the seeing monitor in v - band .",
    "one has to adjust the seeing estimates to the same wavelength , as the resolution @xmath35 depends on wavelength @xmath36 , as @xmath37 .",
    "the individual components are given in table [ table1 ] and are compared to the header information ( adapted to h - band ) .",
    "the agreement between @xmath31 and @xmath38 is satisfactory in all cases .",
    "notice also the good agreement between the width of the nucleus and the star at p.a.=70@xmath205 .",

    "it is shown in figure [ best_fit_hot ] for comparison .",
    "the increased total @xmath97 value ( compared to the cold disk model ) can be explained by the reduced number of degrees of freedom , since in the hot disk model the velocity dispersion and the rotational velocity are coupled through jeans equation .",
    "however , the difference between the two fits is small ( @xmath129 confidence level ) and the large velocity dispersion lead us to consider this model a better description of the physical properties at the center of centaurus  a. +      in this final modeling approach , we account for the fact that the high gas velocity dispersion is not consistent with the assumption of a thin disk . alternatively",
    ", we assume the gas spherically symmetric distributed in individual clouds that move ballistically ( i.e. t@xmath130@xmath131t@xmath132 ) .",
    "given the observational facts ( rotation curves along certain slit positions , gas disk observed by @xcite ) , this model is not very likely to describe the physical properties of the central region in cen  a. however , it gives an upper limit on the black hole mass , compared with disk models at non - extreme inclinations , and is implemented fairly easily .",
    "we construct a spherical jeans model where we assume the following :    1 .",
    "the gas density is given by its emissivity + 2 .",
    "the gas cloud distribution is spherical + 3 .",
    "the gas clouds move in the potential given by the stars and the possible central black hole + 4 .",
    "the stellar mass - to - light - ratio is constant throughout the relevant range ( @xmath133 ) + 5 .",

    "+ again , the stellar mass - to - light ratio is fixed at a value of @xmath139 , that we derived in section [ stellar_mass ] .",
    "the best fitting black hole mass that we find with the spherical jeans model is @xmath140 .",
    "the comparison between the measured and the modelled rms velocity ( @xmath141 ) is shown in figure [ spherical_jeans_gas ] .",
    "the availability of adaptive optics instrumentation opens up new realms of ground based observations . drawing on kinematic data with unprecedented spatial resolution we present a dynamical model of the black hole in the nucleus of centaurus  a.",
    "the spatial resolution that we reach in our h - band spectra is @xmath16 (= 1.8 pc at a distance of 3.5 mpc ) that is a factor of 3 to 4 higher than from the previous ground based observations with isaac by @xcite . at large radii ( @xmath142 )",
    "our data are in agreement with their gas kinematical data , but our high resolution data reveals the steep gradient of the rotation curve in much more detail ( see e.g. figure [ rot ] ) .",
    "the rotation curves show a smooth behavior and the slit position that shows the fastest rotation ( p.a.=@xmath143 ) is nearly perpendicular to the jet direction ( p.a.@xmath144 ) .",
    "this suggests the picture of gas orbiting in a flattened geometry ( presumably a disk ) around the central black hole , with the jet pointed along the disk angular momentum vector .",
    "+      in this paper we present three different dynamical modeling approaches to describe the gas kinematics in the central @xmath145 33pc of ngc5128 .",
    "two of the models are clearly conceptually inconsistent with the data , either neglecting the dominant velocity dispersion of the gas ( model 1 ; cold disk ) , or the disk - like geometry of the velocity field ( model 3 ; isotropic , spherical jeans ) .",
    "we have laid out these extreme models as limiting cases , which would result in a broad mass range , @xmath146 @xmath147 m@xmath86 @xmath147 @xmath148 , and to demonstrate how important the gas physics is , even in light of high resolution data",
    ". our physically most plausible model is a hot disk model at an inclination angle of @xmath55 ; the corresponding black hole mass is m@xmath149 with a line - of - nodes at @xmath150 .",
    "we consider this model the best - fitting since it accounts for the high velocity dispersion of the gas combined with a disk - like gas structure , as suggested by the smooth rotation curves .",
    "the assumption of a geometrically thin disk is not physically motivated but was chosen to eliminate line - of - sight integrations through an underconstrained 3-dimensional gas distribution . +",
    "our disk model meshes well with other constraints on the central geometry of ngc  5128 : e.g. @xcite derived a jet position angle of @xmath144 .",
    "if we assume that the accretion disk and surrounding gas disk is at right angles , we would expect its line - of - nodes to be at @xmath151 . moreover , from the direction of the jet and counter - jet they derived a value for the jet inclination of @xmath152 with respect to the line - of - sight .",
    "our best - fitting inclination angle of @xmath55 is close to their lower value , but our long - slit data do not tightly constrain the inclination angle .",
    "this was also the main source of uncertainty for the black hole mass in the previous study by @xcite .",
    "if we were to consider a gas disk inclination to be as face - on as 25@xmath59 ( inconsistent with the jet inclination ) , the black hole mass would increase to @xmath153 in the hot disk case .    the unsettled question of inclination will presumably be solved with the analysis of integral field spectroscopy data taken with sinfoni at the vlt .",
    "the full 2-d velocity field data provide an excellent means of modelling black hole masses from gas as well as stellar kinematics . +",
    "our best - fit value for the line - of - nodes is only @xmath154 away from the `` expected '' value of @xmath155 , much closer than the value derived by @xcite , @xmath60 .",
    "nonetheless , this confirms that the kinematical line - of - nodes does not coincide with the projected major axis of the gas disk ( p.a.@xmath156 ) seen in pa@xmath157 and [ feii ] with nicmos @xcite .",
    "+ the value that we derived for the black hole mass from the best - fitting hot disk model ( @xmath158 ) is significantly lower than the values both from stellar kinematics presented by @xcite ( m@xmath159 for i=45@xmath59 ) and the previous gas kinematical study of @xcite ( m@xmath160 ) obtained at 3 - 4 times lower resolution .",
    "this decrease in black hole mass estimate with higher resolution data is in line with the decrease in derived black hole masses when hst data became available .",
    "our limiting case model of a spherical gas distribution modeled through jeans equation gives a black hole mass of m@xmath161 which agrees both with @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , in their gas dynamical model @xcite assumed a cold thin disk and did not account for the pressure support of the gas ; assuming a cold disk model , we find the best - fitting black hole mass to be m@xmath162 , which is almost a factor of 7 lower than their value .",
    "+      this confirmation of a fairly high black hole mass compared to a fairly low stellar velocity dispersion of @xmath163 km s@xmath2 @xcite quantitatively reduces but qualitatively confirms the offset of centaurus  a from the m@xmath86-@xmath7 relation @xcite .",
    "the black hole mass predicted by this relation would be around @xmath164 and our best - fitting black hole mass lies a factor of @xmath165 above this .",
    "this offset is close to the observed scatter of the m@xmath86-@xmath7 which is a factor of 1.5 ( 0.2dex ) @xcite . in the case of the lowest black hole mass supported by our cold disk model ( m@xmath162 )",
    "the black hole falls nicely onto this relation . + to compare the black hole mass to the bulge mass of centaurus  a , we applied a spherical jeans model to the whole galaxy as seen in k - band , using the stellar kinematics ( v@xmath166 and @xmath167 ) of @xcite out to @xmath168 and derived a total mass of the spheroid of m@xmath169 .",
    "this mass is in agreement with the value m@xmath170 derived by @xcite and @xcite . given this spheroid mass , cen  a lies below the m@xmath86-m@xmath171 relation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ( i.e. it has a fairly low black hole mass compared to its bulge mass ) but is not a striking outlier in this relation . taken together",
    ", it seems that cen  a foremost has a very high m@xmath172/@xmath173 ratio among ellipticals ( which implies a very low concentration ) , rather than being an outlier in the relations to m@xmath86 .",
    "this low concentration may be explained by the fact that cen  a is known to be a z@xmath1740 merger @xcite .",
