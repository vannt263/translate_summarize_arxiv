    "during at least two points within a neutron star s ( ns ) life , large - scale magnetic field rearrangement may occur .",
    "these are shortly after the formation of nss in supernovae  @xcite , and also during the giant flares of magnetars  @xcite . whilst similar rearrangements may also occur in other stars , they are likely to be particularly significant for the physics of nss , where the fields are exceptionally strong : up to @xmath0 g at the surface of normal pulsars and @xmath1 g for magnetars .",
    "there are a variety of instabilities in nss , and in a proto - ns magnetic fields may actually have a stabilising effect ( see , _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) , but we are concerned here with the fast - acting `` tayler instability '' which affects purely poloidal ( or purely toroidal ) magnetic fields in stars .    the magnetic - field geometry of a ns is important for the star s evolution , provides a distortion that may lead to gravitational radiation  @xcite , as well as powering the mechanisms by which these stars may be observed : the pulsar emission for normal nss , and the x/@xmath2-ray emission of magnetars .",
    "it is important therefore to determine which models of magnetised nss are stable equilibria .    the study of magnetised stellar equilibria dates back to  @xcite .",
    "since then , many possible magnetic equilibria have been studied , using both analytic and numerical techniques .",
    "these have included configurations with purely poloidal fields  @xcite and purely toroidal fields  @xcite , as well as mixed poloidal - toroidal configurations  @xcite .",
    "however , constructing a configuration in equilibrium is only half the problem when modelling stellar magnetic fields ; one also needs them to be stable over many dynamical timescales , since stellar magnetic fields have been observed to be long - lived .",
    "this has proved to be a challenging problem for analytic methods , which can only study the initial localised instability and not the resultant field configuration . with purely poloidal and purely toroidal fields known to be unstable  @xcite ,",
    "only mixed - field configurations are likely to exist in stars .",
    "more recently it has become feasible to use numerical evolutions to study these hydromagnetic instabilities , with the benefit that the global behaviour of the instability may be studied ( analytic works rely on local analyses ) , as well as the final outcome of the instability when the field undergoes significant rearrangement  @xcite . despite this recent progress",
    ", there are still very few models of stellar magnetic - field configurations whose stability has been assessed .",
    "the instability - induced redistribution of magnetic flux is potentially a very violent event and it has been suggested as a trigger mechanism for the giant flares of magnetars  @xcite .",
    "this redistribution is likely to be accompanied by a significant change to the mass quadrupole moment of a ns , making it a potentially detectable source of gravitational waves ( gws )  @xcite .",
    "for this reason it is important to understand the frequency , amplitude and duration these gws may have .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we give a description of our computational infrastructure and initial stellar models . in section 3",
    "we present results from our evolutions , showing the generation of an instability and the subsequent reorganisation of the magnetic field into a more stable configuration .",
    "we also study the gw emission from the instability and assess its detectability .",
    "conclusions are presented in section 4 .",
    "we model our initial ns as a nonrotating isolated fluid body in ideal magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) and with a purely poloidal magnetic field permeating it and extending to the exterior .",
    "the initial axisymmetric equilibrium configuration is generated by the ` lorene ` code , which produces a fully relativistic solution and consistently accounts for the metric distortions and structure deformations induced by the magnetic field ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the star is modelled as a polytrope with equation of state @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 , so that a ns with mass of @xmath6 has a radius of about @xmath7 .",
    "because the timescale for the instability is shorter ( and computationally feasible ) for stronger magnetic fields , we have considered stars with @xmath8 $ ] , where @xmath9 is the value at the magnetic pole , selecting a value of @xmath10 g as the reference one .    using these initial configurations",
    ", we perform general - relativistic mhd simulations in three spatial dimensions under the cowling approximation , _ i.e. _  we do not evolve the einstein equations but consistently solve for the mhd equations in a fixed and curved spacetime .",
    "this choice is motivated by wanting to reduce computational costs and by the fact that the changes in the spacetime are expected to be intrinsically small . as a consequence ,",
    "the gw emission is computed using the newtonian quadrupole formula  @xcite .",
    "the evolutions are performed with the ` whiskymhd ` code , whose properties have been tested and discussed in a number of earlier papers  @xcite .",
    "our standard numerical setup consists of a grid with three refinement levels  @xcite , the highest one having a resolution @xmath11 and covering all of the star .",
    "the outer boundaries are placed at a distance of @xmath12 .",
    "the most salient difference of the code with respect to the references above is in the treatment of the atmosphere .",
    "we recall that as customary in relativistic hydrodynamics using finite - volume methods , we surround the star with a low - density `` atmosphere '' , whose dynamics is prescribed by suitable boundary conditions . more specifically ,",
    "the rest - mass density there is set to a constant value , while the fluid velocity is reset to zero ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "although this prescription works very well in hydrodynamic simulations , it becomes problematic in ideal mhd , since it prevents any evolution of the magnetic field in this region . for sufficiently strong magnetic fields",
    "this approach can rapidly lead to errors at the stellar surface , which prematurely terminate the simulations . to improve on our treatment of the atmosphere and",
    "allow for a dynamics of the magnetic field at surface and outside the star , we add a magnetic diffusivity term to the induction equation , which we write as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the scalar resistivity ( see  @xcite for details on the implementation in ideal - mhd case ) . because we want to retain the ideal - mhd behaviour in the stellar interior and allow for an evolution in the atmosphere , we set the resistivity to zero within the bulk of the star , letting it increase continuously to its atmospheric value starting from a low - density region near the stellar surface .",
    "more specifically , we set @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the rest - mass density , @xmath17 is the fermi function and @xmath18 is a free parameter .",
    "we used a reference value of @xmath19 , but we will discuss how results change for a lower value .    again to reduce computational costs and because we are interested in the development of magnetic - field instabilities , we add a perturbation designed to trigger them . from the analysis of",
    "@xcite we expect a @xmath20-component of the velocity near the neutral line to induce the fastest - growing instability .",
    "hence , we introduce a perturbation of azimuthal index @xmath21 in this quantity , such that the relative change in the magnetic field is @xmath22 .",
    "we have verified that the results do not change qualitatively for other choices of the perturbation and that an instability develops even without a perturbation .",
    "before discussing the nonlinear development of the instability , it is useful to recall the predictions of the perturbative studies of  @xcite and  @xcite about its early growth . in particular , we expect that : _",
    "( i ) _ the instability should be localised in the closed - field line region around the neutral line ( _ i.e. _  where the poloidal magnetic field vanishes ) ; _ ( ii ) _ the instability should occur after about an alfvn timescale @xmath23 ( if @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the average rest - mass density and @xmath26 the stellar radius , @xmath27 ms for our fiducial model ) ; _ ( iii ) _ the ( exponential ) growth rate of the instability should scale linearly with magnetic field strength . as we will discuss , all of these expectations are met .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig1 ] provides snapshots of the development of the instability in our fiducial star , showing projections on the @xmath28 plane ( upper row ) and @xmath29 plane ( lower row ) of the simulation at times @xmath30 ( left to right ) , respectively .",
    "these correspond to early , mid and late stages of the evolution . shown with vectors lines",
    "are the ( global ) magnetic - field lines , while the colors show the intensity of the toroidal magnetic field only ; also reported are the iso - density contours of the rest - mass density near the stellar surface .",
    "as expected , the instability develops around the neutral line ( left column ) , rapidly generating a toroidal magnetic field in this region ( middle column ) .",
    "the growth of this component continues until it reaches a comparable strength to the poloidal one . at this point",
    ", the growth proceeds much more slowly , and the magnetic field evolution is less dramatic ( right column ) , as the star evolves towards a new equilibrium . as revealed by the different panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , the development of the instability breaks the axisymmetry of the initial configuration , leading to a complex structure with high azimuthal wave numbers ( the @xmath31 component is dominant in the middle column ) , which is eventually replaced by an @xmath21 geometry at later stages ( right column ) . while in this complex evolution the ( small ) @xmath32 component is probably inherited from the cartesian coordinate system , it is interesting that the high-@xmath33 modes develop despite the initial perturbation being an @xmath21 one .",
    "note also that the toroidal magnetic field produced by the instability is concentrated in vortices ( smaller at early times and larger at later times ) and that it changes sign both on meridian planes ( see upper row ) and on the equatorial one ( see lower row ) .",
    "this late - time structure is different from the typical ( axisymmetric ) twisted - torus discussed in previous works  @xcite .",
    "we believe that this loss of axisymmetry follows from the conservation of magnetic helicity in ideal mhd  @xcite .",
    "since purely poloidal ( or purely toroidal ) magnetic fields have zero helicity and the latter has to be conserved during a transformation in the ideal - mhd limit , the generation of a vortex structure represents the natural way in which a newly - generated toroidal field will not violate the initial zero - helicity of the system .",
    "a few additional remarks are worth making about fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the first one is about the evolution of the magnetic field in the regions right outside the star , which is essentially controlled by the resistivity there .",
    "although the reference value used , @xmath19 , is rather high and responsible for a considerable decay of the magnetic field , it also allows for a smooth evolution and removes the development of the discontinuities which would appear in the ideal - mhd limit . as we will discuss later on , the qualitative behaviour of the instability is not affected by the value of the resistivity or by the initial magnetic field strength .",
    "the second remark is about the dynamics of the toroidal magnetic field that , as it grows to become locally comparable with the poloidal one , it also moves towards the stellar surface , where it can induce outflows of matter for smaller values of @xmath18 .",
    "while a more detailed discussion of this process will be presented in a subsequent work , it is worth mentioning here that these winds could eject considerable amounts of matter ( _ i.e. _  @xmath34 ) and thus have direct connections with the magnetar phenomenology .",
    "( red solid line ) and poloidal @xmath35 components ( black solid line ) , normalised to the initial value of the magnetic energy .",
    "the dashed lines refer to the corresponding evolution with @xmath36 and show a smaller dissipation of the magnetic field ( see inset ) but the same dynamics in the instability.,width=302 ]    figure  [ fig : fig2 ] provides a more detailed analysis of the instability s behaviour , by monitoring the evolution of the energy in the toroidal @xmath37 ( red solid line ) and poloidal @xmath35 components ( black solid line ) , normalised to the initial value of the magnetic energy .",
    "initially the toroidal component is very small , growing slowly until a time of @xmath38 ms . at this point , which is close to our alfvn - timescale estimate of @xmath39 ms ,",
    "there is a sudden exponential growth , which lasts for another @xmath40 ms . the exponential growth , which nicely matches the predictions of the linear - perturbation regime described by  @xcite , lasts for @xmath41 and then ceases , leaving a configuration which is seen to be roughly unchanged for several more alfvn timescales .",
    "this suggests that the configuration shown in the right column of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] is in a quasi equilibrium and is no longer susceptible to the instability .",
    "note that whilst the local maxima of the field components are likely to dictate the system s stability , the energy eventually present in the toroidal - field component is only @xmath42 of the total magnetic energy .",
    "this value may increase slightly on a much longer timescale .",
    "also reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] as dashed lines are the corresponding evolution of the magnetic energies when a smaller resistivity of @xmath43 is used .",
    "since the evolution of the instability in this case is qualitatively very similar ( _ cf . _",
    "the evolution of @xmath37 ) , we have confidence that our prescription for the resistive behaviour of the magnetic field near the stellar surface does not influence the dynamics of the instability . at the same time , however , a smaller resistivity is also responsible for a smaller decay of the poloidal magnetic field ( see inset ) , which is considerably dissipated by the end of the simulation . while this behaviour is inevitable in a resistive context and has been reported also by other authors  @xcite , it represents an aspect of these evolutions which could be improved with a fully consistent resistive mhd approach  @xcite .",
    "g. marked with a blue star is the corresponding growth - rate for @xmath36.,width=302 ]    another important confirmation of the perturbative analysis is offered in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , where we show the inverse of the growth - time @xmath44 , defined through the exponential growth of the toroidal component , versus the initial magnetic - field strength ( red empty circles ) .",
    "note that the scaling is essentially linear for @xmath45 g , deviating from this for higher values , because of the stronger magnetic tension . more specifically",
    ", the stronger lorentz force will tend to oppose the fluid motions in the polar direction near the neutral line and which trigger the instability .",
    "the presence of a linear scaling is essential to extend our results to typical pulsar magnetic - field strengths , thus estimating a growth - time of @xmath46s for a neutron star with @xmath47 g . also marked in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ( blue star ) is the inverse growth - time for the fiducial star evolved with the smaller resistivity of @xmath43 ; again , the close similarity in the timescales confirms our expectation that the instability is not influenced by the choice of the resistivity .",
    "the final discussion is reserved for the potential gw signal emitted during the development of the instability . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] we report the gw strain in the @xmath48 and @xmath49 polarizations as computed from the newtonian quadrupole formula .",
    "it is quite apparent that the signal is not of a burst type but , rather , that the main effect of the instability is that of triggering large - amplitude oscillations of the star in its fundamental @xmath50-mode .",
    "these gws start emerging from the numerical noise already at @xmath51ms , but are associated to high-@xmath33 oscillations and hence not efficient sources of gws .",
    "however , as the magnetic field starts to approach the final @xmath21 configuration at @xmath52ms , the oscillations become more efficient in producing a gw signal ( note that a @xmath53 pertubation in the magnetic field leads to a @xmath54 perturbation in the density ) . because these oscillations will have a rather narrow spectral distribution peaked around the @xmath50-mode frequency (",
    "which is not significantly affected by the presence of magnetic fields ) , they represent very good sources of a periodic signal , potentially detectable by future advanced detectors . defining the root - sum - square amplitude of the cross polarization as @xmath55^{1/2}$ ] , and assuming that the oscillations will persist undamped for @xmath56s",
    ", we estimate @xmath57 for a source at @xmath58kpc . the corresponding signal - to - noise ratio for a detector such as advanced - ligo or advanced - virgo is @xmath59 , thus potentially observable . a more detailed analysis of the spectral properties of the gw signal will be presented in a future work .",
    "these waveforms represent the first estimate of the conversion of the kinetic energy generated through the instability into gws . for weaker magnetic fields ,",
    "perturbative analyses have suggested this coupling is much weaker  @xcite , but more work is needed to investigate nonlinearly this regime .     and @xmath49 polarizations .",
    "note the instability triggers large - amplitude @xmath50-mode oscillations.,width=302 ]",
    "we report on numerical evolutions of the instability of poloidal magnetic fields in relativistic stars and the subsequent generation of a mixed - field configuration in quasi - equilibrium . in agreement with the expectations from analytic perturbative studies",
    "@xcite , we show that the instability appears after about an alfvn timescale , localised in the region of closed field lines . in addition , the growth - rate of the instability has the expected linear scaling with magnetic field up to very large field strengths .",
    "the instability leads to the generation of a toroidal magnetic field , which starts with a complex and high-@xmath33 azimuthal structure , and is produced in local vortices .",
    "the instability ceases when the two field components are locally comparable in strength and the resulting configuration relaxes towards a geometry dominated by an @xmath21 toroidal component .",
    "this non - axisymmetric configuration is different from the simpler axisymmetric ones of earlier studies  @xcite .",
    "however , it also represents the natural evolution of a system which is required to conserve its initial zero helicity in the ideal - mhd limit .",
    "the total magnetic energy of the final configuration has around a @xmath60 contribution from the toroidal component ; this is comparable with the equilibria studied by  @xcite and  @xcite , but considerably lower than that of  @xcite , where stratified main - sequence stars were considered .",
    "interestingly , the development of the instability also leads to the buoyancy of the newly - generated toroidal magnetic field and this can result into a mass outflow near the stellar surface .",
    "additional work is needed to establish how these winds can be related to the phenomenology observed in giant flares of magnetars .",
    "a consequence of the instability for the very strong magnetic fields considered here is that of triggering large - amplitude oscillations of the star in its @xmath50-mode .",
    "our simulations show that the small - amplitude oscillations of the star are amplified by about an order of magnitude by the time the instability has saturated .",
    "because these oscillations will have frequencies around the @xmath50-mode frequency , it is reasonable to perform searches for periodic signals associated to giant flares in magnetars . for a source at @xmath58kpc with oscillations persisting undamped for",
    "@xmath56s , the root - sum - square amplitude at @xmath61 will be @xmath62 , thus leading to a signal - to - noise ratio @xmath59 for a detector such as advanced - ligo or advanced - virgo .    during the completion of this work we have become aware of a very similar analysis carried out by  @xcite , where the instability of purely poloidal magnetic fields in relativistic stars was also presented . despite the different numerical setups , the results obtained by  @xcite about the development of the tayler instability are in good agreement with those presented here , thus validating each other s conclusions .",
