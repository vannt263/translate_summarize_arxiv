    "finally , we present an interesting consequence of the just described diffusion process . since we sweep the force @xmath153 , the system is no longer autonomous ( not even in the floquet picture ) but becomes explicitly ( and non - periodically ) time dependent .",

    "the latter is similar to the echoes ( revivals ) in the fidelity as a function of time , yet here in a full many - body context @xcite .",
    "in summary , our two - band system is a paradigm example for the implementation ( with ultracold atoms ) and the study of complex non - equilibrium quantum evolutions .",
    "we showed that one may steer the system into equilibrium or keep it relatively coherent ( in the sense of quantum reversibility ) depending on the specific choice of quench parameters .",
