    "the possible discovery of an accelerating universe from observations of type ia supernovae ( perlmutter 1998 , riess 1999 ) has led to a resurgence of interest in the possibility that the universe is dominated by a cosmological constant ( for a recent review see turner 1999 ) .",
    "a number of authors have shown how observations of distant type ia supernovae ( sn ) can be combined with observations of cmb anistropies to constrain the cosmological constant and matter density of the universe ( white 1998 , tegmark 1998 , lineweaver 1998 , garnavich , 1998 , efstathiou and bond 1999 , tegmark 1999 , efstathiou 1999 ) .",
    "for example , efstathiou ( 1999 , hereafter e99 ) combine the large sn sample of the supernova cosmology project ( perlmutter 1998 , hereafter p98 ; we will refer to these supernovae as the scp sample ) with a compilation of cmb anisotropy measurements and find @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 confidence errors ) for the cosmic densities contributed by matter and a cosmological constant respectively .",
    "these results are consistent with a number of other measurements , including dynamical measurements of @xmath0 , the large - scale clustering of galaxies and the abundances of rich clusters of galaxies ( turner 1999 , bridle 1999 , wang 1999 ) .    3.0 truein    the observational evidence for an accelerating universe has stimulated interest in more general models containing a component with an arbitrary equation of state , @xmath16 with @xmath17 .",
    "examples include a dynamically evolving scalar field ( see _ e.g. _ ratra and peebles 1988 and caldwell , dave and steinhardt 1998 , who have dubbed such a component ` quintessence ' ; we will refer to this as a ` q ' component hereafter ) and a frustrated network of topological defect ( spergel and pen 1997 , bucher and spergel 1999 ) .",
    "in particular , steinhardt , wang and zlatev , 1998 , have pointed out that for a wide class of potentials , the evolution of a q - like scalar field follows ` tracking solutions ' , in which the late time evolution is almost independent of initial conditions .",
    "the purpose of this paper is three - fold .",
    "firstly , to illustrate how the constraints on @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be improved by extending the redshift range of the supernovae samples . at low redshifts ,",
    "the magnitude - redshift relation is degenerate for models with the same value of the decellaration parameter @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "this degeneracy can be broken by observing supernovae at redshifts @xmath20 ( see , for example , goobar and perlmutter , 1995 ) .",
    "thus , by extending the redshift range of the current supernovae samples it should be possible to set tighter limits on @xmath0 and @xmath1 independently .",
    "this is important because there are significant worries that the sn data may be affected by grey extinction , evolution , or some other systematic effect .",
    "the consistency of sn constraints on @xmath0 and @xmath1 with those derived from the cmb anisotropy measurements would provide an important consistency check of systematic errors in the sn data and the interpretation of the cmb data .",
    "secondly , we estimate the accuracy with which a more general q - like equation of state can be constrained by high redshift sn and cmb data .",
    "thirdly , we use the current sn and cmb anisotropy data to constrain q - like models in a spatially flat universe and in a universe with arbitrary spatial curvature .",
    "the predicted peak magnitude - redshift relation is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is related to the peak absolute magnitude by @xmath24 . and",
    "@xmath25 is the hubble constant - free luminosity distance . to compute the luminosity distance , we ignore gravitational lensing and use the standard expression for a universe with uniform density",

    "the upper redshift limit is close to the maximum for feasible spectroscopic measurements with @xmath80 metre - class telescopes ( see goobar and perlmutter 1995 ) .",
    "as these authors comment , ground based spectroscopy at optical wavelengths becomes prohibitively expensive for supernovae at higher redshifts because of the strong k - correction .",
    "the last two columns give the errors for a sample twice as large as the scp sample supplemented by 40 supernovae with mean redshift of @xmath34 and @xmath79 .",
    "we adopt a background cosmology with @xmath81 and @xmath82 as indicated by the joint likelihood analysis of the scp sample and cmb anisotropies described in e99 .    from table 1",
    "we see that the fisher matrix analysis of the scp sample gives relatively large errors on @xmath1 and @xmath0 , in agreement with the likelihood analysis presented by p98 . however , by adding @xmath83 sn at @xmath21 , the errors on @xmath1 and in particularly @xmath0 are reduced significantly .",
    "the last column shows that an enhanced scp sample together with @xmath84 sn at @xmath85 ( a formidable , but feasible observing programme ) can provide a tight constraint on @xmath0 .",
    "the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 are , of course , highly correlated .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 1 which shows @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 error ellipses in the @xmath1-@xmath0 plane after marginalizing over @xmath89 assuming a uniform prior distribution .",
    "( the components of the new fisher matrix after marginalization are given by @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 . )",
    "the points in the figure show the results of monte - carlo calculations , where we have simulated the observational samples and determined the parameters @xmath93 by maximising the likelihood function ( equation 2 ) . by diagonalizing the matrix @xmath94 we can find the orthogonal linear combinations @xmath95 and @xmath96 defining the major and minor axes of the likelihood contours shown in figure 1 .",
    "the distributions in these orthogonal directions are shown in figure 2 and compared with the distributions determined from the monte - carlo simulations .",
    "the monte - carlo distributions are very close to gaussians and show that the fisher matrix gives an extremely accurate description of the errors in the @xmath0@xmath1 plane .",
    "5.4 truein    although the errors in @xmath0 and @xmath1 are significantly reduced by the addition of high redshift supernovae over those of the scp sample , they are still quite large in the parallel direction @xmath97 .",
    "this means that it is difficult to set tight limits on @xmath1 from sn measurements alone .",
    "the constraints on the spatial curvature @xmath98 are even weaker . for example , for the larger sample shown in figures 1 and 2 , the @xmath99 error on @xmath98",
    "is @xmath100 .",
    "this can be reduced by extending the range to even higher redshifts ( see section 2.2 ) or by combining the sn data with cosmic microwave background anisotropies , as has been done by several authors ( white 1998 , lineweaver 1998 , garnavich 1998 , tegmark 1999 , e99 ) .",
    "cmb anisotropy measurements , especially with future satellites such as map and planck , are capable of setting tight constraints on the locations of the acoustic peaks in the cmb power spectrum .",
    "following e99 , we define an acoustic peak location parameter @xmath101 to be the ratio of the peak position in a model with arbitrary cosmology compared to that in a spatially flat model with zero cosmological constant .",
    "( this parameter depends weakly on the matter content of the universe and on the spectral index of the fluctuations , but we ignore these small dependences in what follows ) .",
    "cmb measurements are therefore capable of fixing @xmath102 , defining a degeneracy direction in the @xmath1@xmath0 plane given by @xmath103 ( see efstathiou and bond 1998 ) .",
    "the results in the lower panel of table 1 show the fisher matrix analysis of the sn samples including the constraint imposed by equation ( 5 ) .",
    "as is well known , the combination of sn and cmb measurements can break the degeneracy between @xmath1 and @xmath0 and it should be possible to determine these parameters with an error of less than @xmath104 with an enlarged supernova sample assuming , of course , that systematic errors are unimportant .",
    "although the errors on @xmath1 from sn measurements alone converge relatively slowly as the redshift range is increased , consistency of the cosmological parameter estimates provides a strong test of systematic errors in the sn data . if we believe that systematic errors are unimportant , and that our interpretation of the cmb anisotropies ( in terms of adiabatic cdm - like models ) are correct , then current data already constrain @xmath0 and @xmath1 to high precision ( see fig 5 of e99 ) .",
    "consistency requires that the likelihood contours for a high redshift supernova sample converge to the same answer .",
    "3.0 truein      observations of very distant supernovae at @xmath105 may be possible with a next generation space telescope ( _ e.g. _ miralda - escude and rees 1997 , madau 1998 , livio 1999 ) .",
    "we will not analyse the feasibility of such observations here .",
    "rather , we note from figures 1 and 2 that the major axis of the error ellipses in the @xmath1 @xmath0 tilt and become more vertical as the redshift range of the sn sample is increased .",
    "this is because the magnitude redshift relations for models with very different values values of @xmath1 and the same @xmath0 converge at higher redshifts .",
    "the convergence redshift depends on @xmath0 and lies between @xmath106@xmath107 for @xmath0 in the range @xmath108@xmath86 ( see figure 1 of melnick , terlevich and terlevich , 1999 ) .",
    "this is illustrated by figure 3 , which shows the @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath109 likelihood contours determined from the fisher matrix for a sample consisting of twice the scp sample , @xmath110 sn with @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath84 sn with @xmath113 , @xmath114 . as expected , these contours are almost vertical in the @xmath0@xmath1 plane . a sample of supernovae ( or some other distance indicator such as hii galaxies , melnick 1999 ) at redshifts @xmath115 can therefore produce a tight constraint on @xmath0 independently of the value of @xmath1 .",
    "in this section , we analyse the constraints that sn can place on an arbitrary equation of state . we first consider a constant equation of state .",
    "models of this type ( see bucher and spergel ) include a frustrated network of cosmic strings ( @xmath116 ) and a frustrated network of domain walls ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "a constant equation of state is also a good approximation to a q component obeying tracker solutions .",
    "tracker solutions are discussed in section 3.2 .",
    "constraints on generalised forms of dark matter with anisotropic stress are discussed by hu ( 1999 ) and will not be considered here .      3.0 truein",

    "these small differences in the upper limits on @xmath8 are important because they can place significant restrictions on the physics . as stressed in the previous paragraph , the upper limit of @xmath196 places strong constraints on tracker models with simple potentials .",
