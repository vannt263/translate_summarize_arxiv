    "bilayer graphene @xcite is a representative of the recently discovered family of new carbon allotropes.@xcite it attracted attention by the observation of an unusual sequencing of plateaus in the quantum hall effect @xcite and the possibility to modify its spectrum by opening a small gap and induce an insulating state with an external electric field.@xcite the electronic properties of bilayer graphene have been characterised using angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy @xcite and optical absorption in the visible @xcite and infrared @xcite spectral range .",
    "bilayer graphene has also been studied using inelastic scattering of light , subject to the detection of raman - active lattice vibrations in this two - dimensional crystal.@xcite however , no theoretical or experimental study has yet been performed , on the contribution of electronic excitations towards raman spectra of bilayer graphene .",

    "the electronic raman spectroscopy can provide information about various single particle and collective electron excitations in the system studied . in semiconductors ,",

    "the features corresponding to the electronic contribution to the raman scattering in an external magnetic field were observed in many semiconductors , for example , insb ( ref . ) and gaas.@xcite    recently , the raman spectroscopy of electronic excitations in monolayer graphene has been investigated theoretically.@xcite it has been shown that at high magnetic fields the inelastic light scattering accompanied by the excitation of the electronic mode with the highest quantum efficiency involves the generation of inter - band electron - hole pairs . at high ( quantizing ) magnetic fields",
    "this leads to the electron excitations from the landau level ( ll ) @xmath3 at the energy @xmath4 in the valence band to the landau level @xmath5 at the energy @xmath6 in the conduction band with energies @xmath7 and crossed polarisation of in / out photons , in contrast to the @xmath8 transitions between landau levels which are dominant in the absorption of left and right - handed circularly polarised infrared photons.@xcite raman spectroscopy , therefore , provides data supplementary to that obtained in optical absorption .",
    "this fact could be of interest in particular for bilayer graphene placed in an external magnetic field .",
    "recent measurement of the infrared absorption in fields up to @xmath9 t showed @xcite deviations from the tight - binding model for an ideal bilayer . here , we offer a theory for an alternative experimental probe , with different selection rules for the inter - landau - level excitations , which could bring some new insight into the properties of the bilayer graphene .",
    "we study the raman spectroscopy of electronic excitations in bilayer graphene both with and without an external magnetic field using the tight - binding approach .",
    "first , we describe processes in which after the inelastic scattering of the optical photon , an electron - hole pair is created in the low - energy bands of the bilayer .",
    "then , we evaluate the scattering amplitude corresponding to such a process within the framework of the four - band tight - binding model and extract an effective scaterring amplitude that is incorporated into the two - band low - energy hamiltonian for bilayer graphene.@xcite this effective scattering amplitude contains the influence of the high - energy bands and is different from the scattering amplitude found using only the approximate low - energy hamiltonian .",
    "next , we find the low - energy electronic contribution to the raman spectra and obtain an analytic description for the selection rules and intensity of such raman scattering in a bilayer placed in a strong ( quantizing ) magnetic field .",

    "the two - step process , such as shown in fig .",

    "the one - step process is the usual inelastic scattering of an incoming photon on an electron with transfer of energy to the latter . as a result of both one and two - step processes , an electron - hole pair in the low - energy bands",
    "is created with the electron and the hole having almost the same momentum ( @xmath61 and @xmath26 , respectively ) , since @xmath62 and the momentum transfer from light is negligible ( @xmath63 ) .",

    "the probability for the incoming photon to scatter with the raman shift @xmath55 in a particular direction ( defined by the momentum @xmath53 of the scattered photon ) , is , in turn , characterised by the angle - resolved probability of scattering @xmath80 .",

    "we show in appendix that this contribution is much smaller than the leading contribution from the two - step processes , thus , we neglect it in further considerations . to find @xmath43 ,",

    "consequently , the amplitude @xmath43 takes the form of a matrix @xmath98    below , we analyse the contribution of electronic modes toward the low - energy part of raman spectrum with the photon energy shift @xmath99 , which is determined by the excitation of the electron - hole pairs in the low - energy ( degenerate ) bands with @xmath100 . at such low energies , the band structure as well as landau level structure",
