    "kingman s coalescent @xcite is a widely used model for the single - locus genealogy in a population , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "it arises in a suitable rescaling of time under the assumptions of a neutral evolution and an exchangeable reproduction dynamics with short - tailed offspring distribution .",
    "an intuitive way to think of kingman s coalescent is to imagine a random tree with infinitely many leaves at time @xmath0 , where backwards in time any two lineages independently coalesce at rate 1 .",
    "taking @xmath1 instead of infinitely many leaves gives kingman s @xmath1-coalescent .",
    "the latter figures as the genealogy of an @xmath1-sample taken from a large population , and also as the genealogy of the total population in a standard moran model with population size @xmath1 .",
    "two functionals of coalescent trees are of particular interest : the distance from the root to the leaves , or _ depth _ , and the sum of branch lengths , or _ tree length_. it is well known that the expected depth of kingman s @xmath1-coalescent equals @xmath2 , whereas its expected tree length is @xmath3 as @xmath4 .",
    "more can be said : when compensated by @xmath5 , half the tree length of kingman s @xmath1-coalescent converges in law to a gumbel distributed random variable ( having the cumulative distribution function @xmath6 ) .",
    "this result can be read off from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , first equation ) ; see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    with individual offspring distributions that are not short - tailed ,",
    "coalescents different from kingman s appear as the genealogies of large populations . in the so - called @xmath7-coalescents",
    "@xcite , more than two lines can coalesce , giving rise to _",
    "multiple mergers _ , and asymptotic tree length distributions arise that are different from gumbel distributions . for special classes including those of beta - coalescents , results on the asymptotic tree length",
    "were obtained in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    with a population evolving in time ,",
    "its genealogical relationships evolve as well .",
    "their evolution is described by a _ tree - valued process _",
    "@xcite similarly as the change of allele frequencies is captured by measure - valued diffusions @xcite .",
    "jumps of the tree depth correspond to the loss of one of the currently two oldest families from the population , and hence to the establishment of a new most recent common ancestor ( mrca ) of the population .",
    "the resulting tree depth process in the case of kingman s coalescent was analyzed in @xcite and @xcite .    in the present paper we focus on the ( compensated ) tree length in kingman s coalescent and",
    "describe its evolution in an infinite population .",
    "our main result is that this process has cdlg paths and infinite infinitesimal variance ( theorem  [ th1 ] ) . as already stated , the one - dimensional projections of this process are gumbel distributed .",
    "we construct the process of compensated tree length , denoted by @xmath8 , as a limit using tools from weak convergence of processes .",
    "in addition , we also provide a strong convergence result , i.e.  a version of theorem [ th1 ] in terms of convergence towards @xmath8 in probability . for this",
    ", we use the lookdown process introduced in @xcite , which provides genealogies of moran models of any population size on one and the same probability space .",
    "our proposition [ p : th1 ] shows that on this space , the compensated kingman tree lengths lead to a cdlg path - valued limit in probability .",
    "hence , the process @xmath8 can be defined directly in terms of a sequence moran models  or in terms of the lookdown graph  and as such is a natural object to study .",
    "some challenging questions remain , e.g. a ) is the limit robust in the sense that @xmath8 describes also the limiting tree length process for ( a large class of ) cannings models with short - tailed offspring distributions ?",
    "b ) is there an intrinsic characterization of @xmath8 in terms of a stochastic dynamics ?",
    "in particular , is @xmath8 a semimartingale ?",
    "the length of a coalescent is of relevance in empirical population genetics @xcite . in the infinite sites model the number of mutations seen in a population of size @xmath1 at time @xmath0 is poisson distributed with parameter proportional to tree length and to the mutation rate .",
    "the process of tree lengths has also attracted interest in the study of diversity in real populations ( * ? ? ? * fig .",
    "2c ) . there ,",
    "sudden losses of diversity in a population are related to jumps of the tree length process .",
    "such jumps occur at any resampling event and correspond to the length of an external branch breaking off the tree .",
    "the asymptotics of external branch lengths are investigated in detail in @xcite , see also remark [ ebl ] and section [ s : ext ] .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . after specifying the model we present our results on weak ( section [ s : res ] ) and strong ( section  [ s : strong ] ) convergence of tree lengths and tree length processes . in section  [ s:3 ] we provide some auxiliary results on kingman s coalescent for fixed times and on moran models .",
    "section [ s : sec4 ] completes the proof of theorem [ th1 ] , and section [ s : proofs2 ] contains the proofs of the strong convergence results , propositions [ l : gumbel2 ] and [ p : th1 ] .",
