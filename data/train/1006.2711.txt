    "understanding the behavior of _ large pools of credit assets _ is currently a problem of central importance .",
    "banks often hold such large pools and their risk - reward characteristics need to be carefully managed . in many cases ,",
    "the losses in the pool are ( hopefully ) _ rare _ as a consequence of diversification . in @xcite",
    ", we have used the theory of large deviations to gain some insight into several aspects of rare losses in pools of credit assets .",
    "our interest here is the effect of _",
    "recovery_. while a creditor either defaults or does nt ( a bernoulli random variable ) , the amount recovered may in fact take a continuum of values .",
    "although many models assume that recovery rate is constant  i.e . , a fixed deterministic percentage of the par value , in reality the statistics of the amount recovered should be a bit more complicated . the statistics of the recovered amount should depend on the number of defaults ; a large number of defaults corresponds to a bear market , in which case it is more difficult to liquidate the assets of the creditors .",
    "our goal is to understand how to include this effect in the study of rare events in large pools .",
    "we would like to look at these rare events via some ideas from statistical mechanics , or more accurately the theory of _",
    "large deviations_. large deviations formalizes the idea that nature prefers `` minimum energy '' configurations when rare events occur .",
    "we would like to see how these ideas can be used in studying the interplay between default rate and recovery rate .",
    "our work is motivated by the general challenge of understanding the effects of nonlinear interactions between various parts of complicated financial systems .",
    "one of the strengths of the theory of large deviations is exactly that it allows one to focus on propagation of rare events in networks .",
    "our interest here is to see how this can be implemented in a model for recovery rates which depend on the default rate .",
    "this work is part of a growing body of literature which applies the theory of large deviations to problems of rare losses in credit assets and tries to approximate the tail distribution of total losses in a portfolio consisting of many positions . for a survey on some existing large deviations methods applied to finance and credit risk see @xcite . in @xcite",
    "rare event asymptotics for the loss distribution in the gaussian copula model of portfolio credit risk and related importance sampling questions are studied . in @xcite",
    "the author considers saddle point approximations to the tails of the loss distribution .",
    "measures such as value - at - risk ( var ) and expected shortfall have been developed in order to characterize the risk of a portfolio as a whole , see for example @xcite .",
    "issues of recovery have also been considered in the works @xcite and in the references therein .",
    "our work is most closely related to @xcite , where the dynamics of a configuration of defaults was studied . in @xcite",
    "it is assumed that a `` macro - environmental '' variable @xmath1 , to which all the obligors react , can be chosen so that conditional on @xmath1 , the recovery and default rates in a pool of finite number of `` types '' are independent . in @xcite the recovery rate",
    "is assumed to be independent of the defaults in a pool of one type with a brief treatment of a pool with finite types .",
    "our work here is explicitly interested in the _ dependence _ of the recovery rate on the fraction of the number of defaults and the framework of our efforts is a continuum of types .",
    "the case of a continuum of types requires slightly more topological sophistication . the dependence assumption and the continuum of types",
    "unavoidably complicate the proof since several auxiliary technical results need to be proven .",
    "the novelty of our result stems from the following two things .",
    "the first novelty is that the distribution of the recoveries for the defaulted assets depends upon the number of defaults in a fairly general way .",
    "this allows for consideration of the case when recovery rates are affected by the number of defaults .",
    "note however that the individual defaults are assumed independent .",
    "the second novelty is more technical in nature .",
    "in particular , we prove the large deviations principle for the joint family of random variables @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the average loss and @xmath4 is the empirical measure on type - space determined by the names which default .",
    "in addition to the large deviations principle , we derive various equivalent representations for the rate function which give some more insight to the favored way to rearrange recoveries and losses among the different types and also ease its numerical computation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "s : model ] we introduce our model and establish some notation . in section [ s : typicalevents ]",
    "we study the `` typical '' behavior of the loss of our pool ; we need to understand this before we can identify what behavior is `` atypical '' . in section [ s :",
    "heuristics ] , we present some formal sample calculations and our main results , theorems [ t : main ] and [ t : alternativeexpression ] .",
    "these calculations are indicative of the range of possibilities and they illustrate the main results . in section [ s : examplesdiscussion ] we present some numerical examples which illustrate some of the main aspects of our analysis and conclude with a discussion and remarks on future work .",
    "the proof of theorem [ t : main ] is in sections [ s : lsc ] , [ s : lower ] and [ s : upper ] .",
    "section [ s : alternateexpression ] contains an alternative expression of the rate function , which is a variational formula which optimizes over all possible configuration of recoveries and defaults , and which leads to a lagrange multiplier approach which can be numerically implemented .",
    "lastly , section [ s : auxiliarylemmas ] contains the proofs of several necessary technical results .",
    "the model at the heart of our analysis is in fact very stylized .",
    "since our primary interest is the interaction between default rates and recovery rates , our model focuses on this effect , but simplifies a number of other effects .",
    "in particular , we assume that the defaults themselves are independent .",
    "our work complements the existing literature and hopefully contributes to our understanding of the interplay and interaction of recovery and default rates .",
    "it seems plausible that more realistic models ( e.g. , which include a systemic source of risk ) can be analyzed by techniques which are extensions of those developed here .",
    "in this section we introduce our model and explain our goals .",
    "let s start by considering a single bond ( or `` name '' ) . for reference ,",
    "let s assume that all bonds have par value of @xmath5 .",
    "if the bond defaults , the assets underlying the bond are auctioned off and the bondholder recovers @xmath6 dollars , where @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "we will record the default / survival coordinate as an element of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 corresponds to a default and @xmath10 to survival .",
    "the pool suffers a loss when a bond defaults , and the amount of the loss is @xmath11 , where @xmath12 $ ] is the recovery amount ( in dollars ) .",
    "define @xmath13 and let @xmath14 be the non - zero loss that occurs in the event of default of the @xmath15 name , i.e. , when @xmath16 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath14 is the non - zero exposure of the @xmath15 name that occurs when @xmath16 . clearly if @xmath17 is the recovery of the @xmath15 name then @xmath18 .",
    "the default and loss rates in the pool are then @xmath19    we denote by @xmath20 the risk - neutral probability of default of the @xmath15 name in a pool of @xmath21 names .",
    "moreover , let @xmath22 be the distribution of the recovery of the @xmath15 name in a pool of @xmath21 names .",
    "notice that we allow @xmath22 to depend on the default rate @xmath23 .",
    "let us make now the aforementioned discussion rigorous by introducing the probability space that we consider .",
    "the minimal state space for a single bond is the set @xmath24\\right)$ ] .",
    "since we want to consider a pool of bonds , the state space in our model will be @xmath25 , where @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 , as a closed subset of @xmath28 $ ] is also polish , and thus @xmath29 is also polish .",
    "we endow @xmath29 with the natural @xmath30-algebra @xmath31 .",
    "the only remaining thing to specify is a probability measure on @xmath32 . for each @xmath33 , fix @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "these are the risk - neutral default probabilities of the names when the pool has @xmath21 names .",
    "we next fix @xmath35;{{{\\mathscr{p}}[0,1]}})$];{{{\\mathscr{p}}[0,1]}})$ ] as a map from @xmath36\\times { \\mathscr{b}}[0,1]$ ] into @xmath36 $ ] such that for each @xmath37 $ ] , @xmath38 is an element of @xmath39}}$ ] and such that @xmath40 is weakly continuous . ] ; i.e. , a collection of probability measures on @xmath36 $ ] , the range of the recovery , indexed by the default rate @xmath23 .",
    "namely , for each @xmath41 and @xmath42 , @xmath43 is a probability measure that depends on the default rate @xmath23 .",
    "some concrete examples are in subsection [ ss : numericalexamples ] .    for each @xmath44 and @xmath45 , define the coordinate random variable @xmath46 . for each @xmath33 , we then fix our risk - neutral probability measure @xmath47 ( with associated expectation operator @xmath48 ) by requiring that @xmath49={\\mathbb{e}}_n\\left[\\prod_{n=1}^n{\\left\\ { } \\newcommand{\\rb}{\\right\\}}(1-p^{n , n})f_n(0)+ p^{n , n}\\int_{r\\in [ 0,1]}f_n(1,r){\\varrho}^{n , n}(d_n , dr)\\rb\\right]\\ ] ] for all @xmath50 .",
    "in particular , the aforementioned construction implies that for each @xmath44 , @xmath51 is an independent collection of random variables with @xmath52 under @xmath53 .    with this probabilistic structure in place , we will clearly want to be able to condition on the default rate so that we can then focus on the recovery rates . to this end",
    "we define the @xmath30-algebra @xmath54    we are interested in the _ typical behavior _ and _ rare events _ in this system .",
    "we seek to understand the structure of these rare events in our model .",
    "we are interested in the following questions :    * what is the typical behavior of the system ?",
    "in other words we want to characterize @xmath55 . *",
    "what can we say about rare events in this general setting ?",
    "in particular we compute the asymptotics of @xmath56 as @xmath57 , particularly for @xmath58",
    ". then @xmath59 is an `` atypical '' event .",
    "understanding the structure of rare events may give guidance in how to optimally control how rare events propagate in large financial networks .",
    "our formulation allows for a fairly general dependence of the recovery distribution on the default rate .",
    "this is also partially exploited in subsection [ ss : numericalexamples ] where we study several concrete examples . on the other hand ,",
    "the general treatment of this paper unavoidably complicates the proof of the law of large numbers and especially of the large deviations principle .",
    "let s start our analysis by identifying the `` typical '' behavior of @xmath3 as @xmath57 defined by equation ( [ eq : defaultrecoveryrates ] ) . in order to motivate the calculations ,",

    "every third bond will be of type @xmath77 and have default probability @xmath72 and recovery distribution governed by @xmath74 , and the remaining bonds will have default probability @xmath73 and recovery distribution governed by @xmath75 . in other words , the rate of default among the @xmath77 bonds is @xmath72 and the rate of default among the @xmath78 bonds is @xmath73 .    for future reference , let s separate the defaults and into the two types . if we define @xmath79 we have @xmath80 thus @xmath81 and @xmath82 , so @xmath83 thus we should roughly have @xmath84 where the @xmath85 s have law @xmath86 , the @xmath87 s have distribution @xmath88 and the @xmath85 s and @xmath87 s are all independent .",

    "for @xmath283 and @xmath132 , the gibbs conditioning principle ( * ? ?",

    "our formulation allows to extract some information regarding the optimal default rate in the pool for a given level of average loss in the pool .",
    "moreover , a useful insight into the fact that losses are due to _ both _ default and recovery is perhaps given by the _ effective average recovery _ as defined by relation ( [ eq : optimalaveragerecovery ] ) . * as it is indicated by the comparison of cases 5 and 6 , the effect of the dependence of the distribution of the recovery on the default rate is ( a ) : to reduce the rate function and ( b ) : to reduce the effective average recovery of the pool especially when the optimal default rate gets larger .",
