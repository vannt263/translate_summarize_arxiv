    "the scaling violation of nucleon structure functions is described in terms of dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) evolution equations @xcite .",
    "the dglap integrodifferential equations describe the @xmath3 dependence of the structure functions , which are related , _ via _ the operator product expansion , to the parton distributions for which the dglap equations are usually written down . in this framework , the analysis of the experimental data , is performed fixing at some @xmath4 the structure functions by assuming the parton distributions and computing the convolutions with the coefficient functions , which can be evaluated in perturbation theory .",
    "the comparison with experimental data , which are distributed at different values of @xmath3 , goes through the solution of dglap equations for the parton distributions ; thus a reliable and fast algorithm to solve these equations is welcome .    in literature",
    "there are essentially three different approaches to solve the dglap equations . the first one is based on the laguerre polynomials expansion @xcite .",
    "this technique is quite accurate up to @xmath0-values not smaller than @xmath5 ; on the contrary , below @xmath6 the convergence of the expansion slows down @xcite .",
    "given that experimental data are already available down to about @xmath6 , for the polarized case , and down to @xmath7 , for the unpolarized case , this method results no longer practical ( for a more detailed discussion see section * [ s : nunan]*).an alternative approach takes advantage of the fact that the moments of the convolutions appearing in the equations factorize in such a way that the analytical solution , in the momentum space , can be written down @xcite .",
    "however , also in the most favorable case in which the analytical expressions of the moments of the initial conditions are known , the numerical mellin inversion is relatively cpu time consuming ( see @xcite).another strategy , the so called `` brute force '' method @xcite , is fundamentally a finite - differences method of solution .",
    "it reaches a good precision in the small @xmath0-region @xcite but requires a rather large amount of computer running time .    in this paper",
    "we present a new semianalytical method , to solve dglap equations .",
    "it consists in constructing an evolution operator which , depending only on the splitting functions , can be worked out once for all . in this respect",
    "our strategy is similar to the one in @xcite .",
    "our method to perform the convolutions instead , takes advantage of an @xmath0 discretization ( comparable to the one in @xcite ) which allows us to represent the evolution operator as a matrix .",
    "thus the procedure to construct the solution reduces merely to a multiplication between the _ evolution matrix _ and an _ initial vector _ , and can be done in an extremely short computer time with the required accuracy .",
    "this is particularly appealing in the analysis of the experimental data on nucleon structure functions which requires a large number of parton evolutions.in the next section we discuss the ( formal ) analytical solution of the dglap equations ; in the third one the algorithm to perform the @xmath8integration is presented .",
    "the last two sections are devoted to analyze the numerical results relative to the evolution of polarized parton distributions , to study the yield of our method in comparison with others and to conclude .",
    "in this section we review briefly the mathematical problem of dglap evolution equations and propose a method to solve them . in the following",
    "we limit ourselves to discuss the polarized parton distributions .",
    "the application of our method to the unpolarized case is straightforward .    the dglap equation , up to next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) corrections , for the non - singlet distribution is @xmath9 while for the singlet and gluon distributions we have : @xmath10 \\otimes \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } \\delta \\tilde q_{s}(x , t ) \\\\",

    "( [ e : ns])-([e : sg ] ) @xmath19 the explicit expressions for @xmath20 , @xmath21 as well as for the splitting functions @xmath22 can be found in @xcite .    the equations ( [ e : ns ] ) and ( [ e : sg ] )",
    "can be written in the following general form : @xmath23 where @xmath24 indicates the  vector of components @xmath25 \" and @xmath26 a linear operator acting as : @xmath27_x \\equiv \\int_x^1 ~dy~ \\omega(x , y , t)\\;f(y , t)\\;.   \\label{e : defodot}\\ ] ] note that , in the singlet - gluon case , @xmath24 becomes a doublet of vectors and @xmath26 a @xmath28x@xmath29 matrix of operators .    due to the logarithmic dependence of @xmath15 on @xmath3 , the range of values of physical interest for @xmath30 ( @xmath31 is the starting values of @xmath15 , where the parton distributions are assumed known ) is small enough to expect that the taylor s series of the solution @xmath24 converges rapidly .",
    "on the other hand , by deriving repeatedly the eq .",
    "( [ e : gf ] ) we can write : @xmath32 where the operators @xmath33 can be obtained recursively : @xmath34 the @xmath35 indicates the @xmath36th term of the @xmath37th row of tartaglia triangle and @xmath38 then the solution can be written as : @xmath39 with @xmath40 the evolution operator .    as we will point out in section * [ s : xintegration ] * the series in eq .",

    "we would stress the fact that the matrices @xmath33 depend only on the points @xmath94 and so they can be numerically evaluated once for all .",
    "the convergence of our algorithm is controlled by two parameters : the order @xmath95 of the truncated series @xmath96 which define the evolution operator , and the number @xmath97 of the points of @xmath8integration .    to test the accuracy of our method we evolve the gehrmann and stirling polarized singlet - gluon initial distributions ( cf @xcite ) : @xmath98 from @xmath99 to @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",

    "( [ e : solution ] ) .",
    "] it appears evident that an excellent approximation of the solution is obtained .",
    "another advantage of our method , once fixed the accuracy of the solution , appears to be the running time to get each evolution .",
    "in fact , the simple analytical structure of the evolution matrix @xmath133 makes the solution procedure considerably fast . as a matter of fact , once given the splitting functions and constructed the corresponding matrices @xmath33 ( we have used mathematica @xcite to do this ) , a single evolution , i.e. the multiplication of the @xmath133 evolution matrix by the initial vector , require , for @xmath116 and @xmath126 , about @xmath134 on an alphaserver 1000 using a fortran code .",
    "particularly interesting is the comparison between our method and the one presented in @xcite , where an evolution operator is also introduced .",
    "firstly we observe that the latter method is based on a polynomial expansion of the splitting and distribution functions .",
    "the expansion is equivalent to an expansion in power of @xmath0 . as a consequence",
    "it is affected by problems of convergence for @xmath135 , due to the branch point in zero of the involved functions .",
    "this is the source of the difficult encountered in the small-@xmath0 region , which are not present in our approach in which an optimized newton - cotes - like quadrature formula is employed.second , also in the @xmath0-region of convergence , the laguerre polynomial expansion needs , for each evolution process , the computation of the moments of the initial parton distributions with respect to the polynomials : this procedure requires a remarkable amount of cpu - time with respect to our approach in which only the evaluation of the initial parton distribution in the @xmath97 grid points is needed .",
    "we have proposed a new algorithm to solve the dglap evolution equations , in the @xmath0-space , which appears suitable for a rather large class of coupled integrodifferential equations .",
    "the method produces a solution which is analytical in the @xmath3-evolution parameter and approximate , but rapidly convergent , in the @xmath8space .",
    "it allows to construct , once for all , an evolution operator in matrix form .",
    "it depends only on the splitting functions appearing in the equations and can be rapidly applied to whatever initial distribution to furnish the evolved one , requiring for each evolution only a few hundredth of second .",
    "it is worth to note the reliability of our @xmath8integration algorithm , which gets excellent approximations on the whole @xmath8range ( we use , for all the calculations , @xmath136",
    "@xmath0 @xmath137 1 ) , also with few integration points , resulting in an evolution matrix of particularly small dimensions .    in conclusion ,",
    "our method , whose numerical implementation is straightforward , appears to be very fast , very accurate and extremely stable with respect to the increasing of convergence parameters ( i.e. @xmath95 , the order of the truncated series which gives the evolution operator , and @xmath97 , the number of integration points ) . for these reasons it represents a powerful tool to analyze the experimental data on nucleon structure functions .",
