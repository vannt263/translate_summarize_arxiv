    "progress in purely optical trapping techniques now allows the confinement of these atoms with their full spin degrees of freedom present @xcite which permits the study of the interplay between magnetism and superfluidity . in such systems , in addition to the usual spin - independent contact interaction , there are spin - dependent terms @xcite and also longer range interactions @xcite .",
    "mean field calculations @xcite in the absence of the long range interactions , show that the interactions can be ferromagnetic ( _ e.g .  _",
    "@xmath0rb ) or antiferromagnetic ( _ e.g .  _",
    "@xmath1na ) , depending on the relative magnitudes of the scattering lengths in the singlet and quintuplet channels .",
    "when loaded in an optical lattice , the system is governed by an extended hubbard hamiltonian with spin - dependent and spin - independent terms .",
    "the phase diagram in the mean field and variational approximations has been calculated at zero @xcite and at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "the overall picture emerging from these calculations is that in the ferromagnetic case , _",
    "i.e. _ negative spin - dependent interaction , the system is in a mott insulating ( mi ) phase when the filling is commensurate with the lattice size and the repulsive contact interaction is strong enough . when this interaction is weaker , or when the particle filling is incommensurate , the system is in a ferromagnetic superfluid ( sf ) phase . the sf - mi transitions in the ground state are all expected to be continuous .",
    "furthermore , all mott lobes shrink , and eventually disappear , as the ratio of the spin - dependent interaction to the spin - independent one increases .",
    "these predictions have been confirmed for the one - dimensional case with quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram for the antiferromagnetic case also has mi lobes at commensurate fillings and strong coupling and a sf phase at weak coupling or incommensurate fillings .",
    "however , the nature of the sf phase and the mi - sf transitions are different . in this case , the sf phase is `` polar '' : superfluidity is carried either by the @xmath4 component or by the @xmath5 components .",
    "furthermore , the mott lobes of odd order are expected to be nematic in two and three dimensions and dimerized in one dimension @xcite . the mi - sf transition into these odd mott lobes is generally expected to be continuous . in the even mott lobes , the bosons are predicted to be in a singlet state which is expected to increase the stability of the mi .",
    "this transition from non - singlet sf to singlet mi is argued to render the transition into the even mott lobes of first order .",
    "density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite and qmc @xcite calculations for one - dimensional systems have confirmed the dimerized nature of odd lobes , and determined the phase diagram .",
    "further qmc work @xcite presented evidence of singlet formation in the even lobes but did not find clear evidence of first order phase transitions .",
    "a related model is obtained by coupling degenerate atomic ground states and degenerate excited states ( see next section ) to yield a system of two bosonic species sometimes referred to as spin-@xmath6 bosons @xcite .",
    "as for the full spin-@xmath7 case , the spin - dependent interaction can be ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic .",
    "mean field analysis of this model @xcite yielded phase diagrams which are rather similar to the spin-@xmath7 case . in this paper",
    "we shall present an extension of previous mean field treatments @xcite which yields better qualitative agreement with exact qmc simulations , which we also present for the one - dimensional system .",

    "ii the hamiltonian of two bosonic species is presented .",
    "the mean field phase diagram is discussed in sec .",
    "iii . finally , in sec .",
    "iv quantum monte carlo calculations on one dimensional lattices verify the qualitative conclusions of the mean field theory ( mft ) , but provide quantitatively accurate values for the phase boundaries .",
    "we follow ref .  @xcite and consider a system of neutral polarizable bosonic atoms with three degenerate internal ground states ( @xmath8 ) and excited states ( @xmath9 ) characterized by the magnetic quantum number @xmath10 .",
    "the atoms are loaded in a @xmath11-dimensional optical lattice produced by counterpropagating laser beams . as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , in addition to generating the optical lattice , the lasers can be used to couple the internal ground and excited states by @xmath12 and @xmath13 transitions leading to two sets of orthogonal bloch eigenmodes denoted respectively by @xmath3 and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the resulting bose hubbard hamiltonian is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) creates ( annihilates ) a particle of `` spin '' @xmath17 on site @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the spin - independent contact repulsion term and @xmath20 is the spin - dependent interaction term .",
    "the number operator , @xmath21 , counts the number of particles of type @xmath22 on site @xmath18 and @xmath23 is the chemical potential . we take the hopping parameters @xmath24 to set the energy scale .",
    "the phase difference , @xmath25 , gives the relative global phase between the two species .",

    "@xcite after one uses eqs .",
    "( 13 ) and ( 15 ) of that reference .",
    "the relative phase , @xmath26 , was then determined by the requirement that the total energy be minimized .",
    "it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that since @xmath20 can be positive or negative , the way to minimize the energy is to have the coupling in the third term of eq .",
    "( [ ham1 ] ) be of the form @xmath27 .",
    "this gives @xmath28 for @xmath29 and @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "the hamiltonian then becomes @xmath32 however , this is not the only possible solution : the sign of the third term has no effect on the energy and the hamiltonian obtained by putting @xmath28 both for @xmath20 positive or negative , @xmath33 yields exactly the same free energy as eq .",
    "( [ ham2 ] ) . for the @xmath29 case ,",
    "this is obvious since eq .",
    "( [ ham2 ] ) is identical to eq .",
    "( [ ham3 ] ) . for @xmath31 ,",
    "this can be seen by writing the partition function , @xmath34 , and noting that if we expand the exponential in powers of the term in question , only even powers will contribute .",
    "in fact , for @xmath31 , one can transform eq .",
    "( [ ham2 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ ham3 ] ) by a simple phase transformation , @xmath35 .",

    "( [ ham2 ] ) and ( [ ham3 ] ) are valid and yield the same results for energies and all other quantities that are invariant under the above phase transformation when examined with an exact method such as qmc .",
    "this is not necessarily so when approximations are made as we shall see in the next section .",
    "in this section we revisit the mean field phase diagrams of the model governed by eq .",

    "the basis is truncated for large particles number ( typically @xmath44 ) to obtain results independent of the truncation .",

    "the energy has one minimum at @xmath49 corresponding to the mi .",
    "figure [ ferroemin](a ) shows this for the mott phase with two particles / site , @xmath50 . for any non commensurate filling and for commensurate",

    "figures [ ferroemin](b , c ) show how the minimum at @xmath49 transforms continuously into four degenerate minima visible in fig .",
    "[ ferroemin](d ) as the interaction gets weaker .",
    "the same behaviour is seen for the mi at all other commensurate fillings .",
    "the mf phase diagram is obtained by repeating the above calculation for many values of the chemical potential , @xmath23 , and the interaction @xmath53 ( always keeping @xmath54 constant ) . in the no - hopping limit , @xmath55 , it is easy to see that when @xmath23 satisfies the condition , @xmath56 the system is in a mi phase with @xmath57 bosons per site .",
    "as @xmath48 increases , always keeping @xmath58 constant , the mi region shrinks and eventually disappears giving the familiar mott lobes . outside the mi",

    "we see that all compressible regions , @xmath65 , are superfluid while the incompressible plateaux , @xmath66 , are not superfluid , they are the mi .",

    "( [ mftham3 ] ) leads to results which are similar in some ways to the above but different in very important aspects .",
    "first , for a given choice of @xmath73 and @xmath23 , we found that the two mean field hamiltonians give the same ground state energy both in the sf and mi phases .",

    "( [ mftham2 ] ) .",
    "as the system is brought closer to the lobe tip , the behavior depends on whether the filling in the mott phase is odd or even .",
    "odd filling is similar to the ferromagnetic case : the global minimum at @xmath49 transforms continuously into four degenerate minima with non - vanishing order parameter .",
    "however , in this anti - ferromagnetic case , the minima lie on the @xmath71 and @xmath72 axes : either @xmath74 while @xmath75 , or @xmath76 while @xmath77 .",

    "first , local minima develop with non - vanishing order parameter , indicating metastable sf , fig .",
    "[ antiferroemin](b ) .",
    "these local minima then become global , for lower @xmath53 , while the previously global minimum at the origin becomes local indicating that the mi is now metastable , fig .",

    "such behaviour signals a first order sf - mi transition for the even mott phases .",
    "the nature of the transition is in agreement with ref .",

    "we also note that the transition into the fourth plateau is discontinuous : we see clearly the discontinuous jumps of @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath84 as this plateau is approached .",
