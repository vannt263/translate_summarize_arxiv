    "in the recent years the condensed matter many - body systems have extensively been used for realization of quantum information tasks such as quantum state transfer @xcite . in particular , finite many - body systems , such as spin chains ,",
    "have been proposed to operate as data - bus @xcite through their natural time evolution . very recently , experimental realizations of such ideas have become viable in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) @xcite , coupled optical wave guides @xcite and optical lattices @xcite . however , there is a threshold between the quality of state transfer and the amount of control that one can have over the system .",
    "perfect state transfer comes at its price @xcite .",
    "to achieve such task one has to engineer the spectrum of the system by either engineering all couplings @xcite or just the two at the boundaries @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can also use precisely time controlled local or global fields @xcite for routing information or create resonant dynamics between the sender and receiver by using very weak couplings @xcite or strong local magnetic fields @xcite . in all these methods , a very fine control over the couplings ( either local or global ) is needed which is often not available for the most physical systems used in laboratories .",
    "thus , one may think of the minimal control of the most simplest systems ( with uniform couplings ) for achieving the highest possible fidelity . in a uniform xx chain",
    "one can achieve pretty good state transfer , with arbitrarily high fidelity , for very particular lengths though one has to wait for very long times @xcite .",
    "the most studied mode of transmission so far is to attach a qubit encoding an _ unknown _ quantum state to the spin chain which is motivated by the need to link quantum registers .",
    "this needs fine local control over a single bond of the hamiltonian which has to be switched on and off at regular times which makes it very challenging for physical realizations .",
    "moreover , for the case of anti - ferromagnetic systems this mode of transfer does not harness the inherent entanglement naturally existed in the ground state of such systems .",
    "the initial state of the channel changes the quality of transfer for both free fermions and interacting hamiltonians @xcite and in the case of non - interacting fermionic systems it is possible to engineer the system such that it works fully independent of the initial state @xcite .",
    "recent achievements in optical lattice experiments for local addressability of atoms with the resolution of single sites @xcite has opened a totally new window for single site unitary operations and measurements @xcite .",
    "the propagation of spin waves @xcite and magnon bound states @xcite have been observed in ferromagnetic spin chains realized by trapped atoms in optical lattices .",
    "motivated by these achievements , new modes of transfer in many - body strongly correlated systems have been proposed which are not based on attaching scenarios which demand very fine control of a single bond in the hamiltonian . in ref .",
    "@xcite a single qubit unitary operation together with local measurements on a system initialized in a series of singlets are used for achieving more than one bit of information transfer in a single shot in the same spirit of quantum dense coding @xcite .",
    "we have also put forward a proposal for measurement induced transport ( mit ) @xcite without changing the hamiltonian for information transfer which exploits only local measurement and unitary rotation of single qubits , the two ingredients both available in optical lattices . in such scenario ,",
    "a known quantum state is encoded in the first qubit of the system through a local measurement followed by a unitary operation and then the natural time evolution of the system transfers this quantum state to the receiver site . as the quantum state",
    "is assumed to be _ known _ this mode of transfer can also be considered as remote quantum state preparation @xcite .    in this paper , by exploiting exact diagonalization we study the information transferring ability of a uniform spin-1/2 xxz hamiltonian throughout its anti ferromagnetic and nel phases for two different modes of transfer namely : ( i ) the well studied attaching scenario and ; ( ii ) the recently proposed mit scheme .",
    "we also compare their performance in the presence of imperfections such as decoherence and thermal fluctuations .",
    "we show that while the two schemes give the same fidelity for non - interacting free fermionic systems the measurement scenario provides a sensibly better performance for the interacting systems .",
    "moreover , the measurement procedure for state transfer shows more robustness against various imperfections such as thermal fluctuations .",
    "the structure of the paper is as following . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we introduce the model , in section [ sec3 ] the state transfer is investigated by calculation the average fidelity in both measurement and attaching scenarios and the results are compared . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "the effect of thermal fluctuations and decoherenc is studied .",
