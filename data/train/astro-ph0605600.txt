    "a good example is the prototypical merger remnant ngc 7252 , which has star - gas counter - rotation in its core ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "more recently , bertola , buson and zeilinger ( 1992 ) found that , even in a significant fraction of s0 galaxies , the warm and cold gas may be of external origin .",
    "the first broad search for counter - rotating gas and stars in a sample of galaxies representative of all morphological types and of the local galaxy luminosity function @xcite showed that counter - rotators can be found in s0 s over a large range of luminosity , but that they occur much less frequently among sa s and are absent in later type galaxies .",
    "recently , @xcite found some dwarf ellipticals with kinematically decoupled cores and concluded that they probably originate from an interaction with a giant elliptical or a flyby with a massive galaxy , while a merger origin is ruled out .",

    "the hi  morphology and kinematics suggest that some hi  gas has been tidally stripped from ngc  1602 by ngc  1596 .",
    "first , two arms ( the nw and ne tails ) are located at velocities lower and higher than ngc  1602 , suggesting that they point in opposite directions with respect to each other along the line - of - sight , similarly to the features formed in tidal interactions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "second , the complex hi  morphology strengthens the suggestion made by @xcite that ngc  1596 and ngc  1602 have interacted in the past .",
    "ngc  1602 most likely had a very extended hi  disc , as is common for dwarf irregular galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "one or several close passages of ngc  1602 near the hi  poor s0 galaxy ngc  1596 pulled out what appears to be two hi  tidal tails .",

    "[ fig-3dgas ] , we present 3d renderings of the hi  cube , indicating where ngc  1596 and ngc  1602 are in the plane of the sky and along our line - of - sight . note that the tails are very distinct in velocity .",
    "figure [ fig - spcut ] shows a position - velocity cut along the two tails .",
    "the continuous velocity gradient along both tails is remarkable , though there is a kink in velocity between the nw tail and ngc  1602 .",
    "this kind of jump has been seen before in the tidal tail of a merger remnant ( ngc  7252 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see their fig .",
    "1 ) , and could be the combined effect of a projection and the tidal tail detaching itself , forming a dwarf galaxy .    since the tails are in different orbital planes ( they would otherwise cross ) , more than one close passage must have taken place .",
    "indeed , @xcite showed in their n - body model of m51 that significant out - of - plane velocities can be produced through multiple encounters .",
    "we speculate that the nw tail was pulled out in a first encounter , while the ne tail was pulled out in a second closer passage .",
    "the asymmetric hi  distribution in ngc  1602 ( toward ngc  1596 ) also suggests that this is the most recent event ( figs .",
    "[ fig - mom0 ] and [ fig-3dgas ] ) .",
    "the higher resolution hi   image of ngc  1602 even shows a hint of a counter tail in the east .",
    "third , ngc  1596 s stripping of the hi  gas from ngc  1602 is plausible in terms of timescales . assuming that the total hi  found in this region used to belong to ngc  1602 , roughly 0.9@xmath54 of hi  has been stripped .",
    "the nw and ne tail are about 49 kpc and 38 kpc long , respectively , projected on the sky ( from the center of ngc  1602 to where those concentrations are present ; see section [ result ] ) .",
    "the hi  kinematics tells us that it would take roughly @xmath55 yr for the gas to travel from the center of ngc  1602 to where the tails reach at present .",
    "since there must have been at least two passages , this yields a lower limit of about 1 gyr to form both tails . some simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show that it is possible to form tails with those lengths in such time scales .",
    "note that the hi  mass found in tidal features can be as large as @xmath56 ( e.g. in the southern tail of ngc  3921 ; * ? ? ?",
    "these properties suggest that most of the gas originally belonged to ngc  1602 and that some of the hi  has been stripped by the interaction with ngc  1596 , forming the two tidal tails .     and",
    "the total length of the cut @xmath57 ( upper panel ) . the nw tail ( lower velocities ) is not only spatially but also kinematically more distinct than the ne tail .",
    "the cut clearly shows that the hi  around ngc  1602 , the major hi  reservoir , is highly asymmetric and more extended toward ngc  1596 .",
    "[ fig - spcut],width=264 ]     and the total length of the cut @xmath57 ( upper panel ) . the nw tail ( lower velocities )",
    "is not only spatially but also kinematically more distinct than the ne tail .",
    "the cut clearly shows that the hi  around ngc  1602 , the major hi  reservoir , is highly asymmetric and more extended toward ngc  1596 .",
    "[ fig - spcut],width=264 ]      the question remains whether the stripped hi  is responsible for the counter - rotating ionized gas found in ngc  1596 .",
    "first , the fact that there is a large gas reservoir available around ngc  1596 makes the connection between the hi  and the counter - rotating ionized gas more likely than an internal origin .",
    "in addition , the hi  and the ionized gas have the same velocity gradient , opposite to that of the stars . in figure",
    "[ fig - comxv ] , the hi  position - velocity diagram ( pvd ) along the major - axis of ngc  1596 is compared with that of the ionized gas found in the optical spectra and the stellar rotation curve .",
    "the hi   concentration to the ne and over a large velocity range is the ne tail .",
    "it is clear that the hi  and the ionized gas have the same velocity gradient , both rotating in the opposite direction to the stars . whether the accreted gas is co- or counter - rotating with the disc clearly depends on how it falls in",
    "however , the large - scale agreement between the velocity gradient of the hi  and the ionized gas in the disc of ngc  1596 ( fig .",
    "[ fig - comxv ] ) makes the connection between the hi  gas of ngc  1602 and the ionized gas in ngc  1596 more plausible .",
    "the counter - rotating ionized gas in ngc  1596 very likely originated from the hi  gas stripped from ngc  1602 , which must have been accreted in retrograde motion with respect to the stellar disc .",
    "given the highly asymmetric distribution of the ionized gas in the disc of ngc1596 , there must not have been enough time for the accreted material to totally settle .",
    "the accretion onto ngc  1596 must have been ongoing for not much longer than @xmath58 yrs , i.e. one rotation period .",
    "there is a local hi  peak in the nw tail which also shows a faint stellar counterpart ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) .",
    "the peak gas column density of this region in fact exceeds the standard star formation threshold @xcite and @xcite identified a distinct object in this location , classifying it as dwarf elliptical ( @xmath61 and @xmath62 mag ) .",
    "this object is however not likely to be a normal dwarf elliptical , based on its high gas - to - light ratio . the hi  mass within @xmath63 around ( @xmath64)@xmath65 , where the kinematics is fairly well defined ( fig .",
    "[ fig - spcut ] ) , is 4.8@xmath66 .",
    "this yields @xmath5/@xmath6@xmath67 @xmath68 ( or , assuming a linewidth of 60@xmath69 km s@xmath9 , @xmath70/@xmath6@xmath32164 @xmath68 ) , which is much larger than that of typical de galaxies ( @xmath71 , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "also , since gas rich low surface brightness galaxies have @xmath5/@xmath6  and @xmath70/@xmath6  in the range of @xmath72 and @xmath73 @xmath68 , respectively @xcite , it is also unlikely that the object is an lsb galaxy .",
    "this faint optical counterpart is thus more likely to be a dwarf formed at the end of one tidal arm than a normal de or an lsb that was there before the interaction started .",
    "the idea of creating dwarf galaxies in collisions of galaxies ( tidal dwarfs or tdgs ) was first proposed by @xcite and a fair number of candidates have been found ( e.g. in ngc  4038/9 , the antennae ; hibbard et al .",
    "2001 and references therein ) .",
    "deep h@xmath74/@xmath75 imaging or metallicity measurements should enable us to sort out this issue .    as shown in figure [ fig-3dgas ] , the tidal tails are not in the same orbital plane , implying that there must have been more than one close approach between the two galaxies .",
    "it is possible that ngc  1596 was approached from the back side of ngc  1602 along the line - of - sight , pulling out the nw tail first and the ne tail more recently .",
    "this time sequence is also consistent with the fact that only the nw tail shows a stellar counterpart .",
    "the stars could have formed in situ in the nw tail , or alternatively they may have been stripped with the gas in the tidal encounter .",
    "further optical observations ( e.g. h@xmath74 imaging or spectroscopy ) should also help to sort this out .",
    "some of the gas from the ne tail must have been accreted onto ngc  1596 ( in retrograde motion with respect to the stars ) after the second approach .",
    "it is worth recalling that ngc  1596 possesses a boxy bulge , one of the morphological signatures of a thickened bar seen edge - on ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "ngc  1596 also revealed kinematic signatures of a bar in the study by @xcite .",
    "the bar may have contributed to transport the material to the central part of the disc , although such processes are inefficient for counter - rotating material .",
    "it is also possible that the interaction with ngc  1602 accelerated the formation of the bar in ngc  1596 ( or vice - versa ) as has been shown to occur in simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we presented the hi  distribution and kinematics of the galaxy pair ngc  1596/ngc  1602 and its surrounding . hi  is found in a broad region @xmath1 covering ngc  1596 and its hi - rich companion ngc  1602 .",
    "this region corresponds to @xmath7670 kpc@xmath77 assuming an 18 mpc distance .",
    "the total hi  mass found is 2.5@xmath4 and about half of this is concentrated in and around ngc  1602 .",
    "both the hi  morphology and kinematics suggest that ngc  1602 is the main gas reservoir .",
    "two tidal tails are found , respectively at lower and higher velocities with respect to ngc  1602 , which were most likely caused by an interaction with ngc  1596 .",
    "the counter - rotating ionized gas found in ngc  1596 thus probably originated from hi  gas transferred from ngc  1602 to ngc  1596 .",
    "besides the fact that there is a huge gas reservoir available in this region , this is also supported by the consistent velocity gradient of the hi  and the counter - rotating ionized gas along the major - axis of ngc  1596 .",
    "we find a local hi  peak in the nw tail , where we also see a faint stellar counterpart . the @xmath5/@xmath6  ( or @xmath70/@xmath6 ) ratio of this region is unrealistically high for a normal de or lsb galaxy , and it is more likely to be a dwarf that has formed at the tip of a tidal arm ( tdg ) .",
    "our discovery of counter - rotating gas in the sample of @xcite was somewhat fortuitous . in spite of the difficulty to find such objects , they are known to be common ( bureau & chung 2006 and references therein ) , and although there are only a few known counter - rotators showing direct evidence for ongoing accretion ( e.g. ic  1459 , * ? ? ? * ) , signatures of past mergers or hints of tidal interactions are found in a number of them @xcite .",
    "counter - rotators thus support the idea that tidal interactions and accretion play an important role in galaxy formation and evolution .",

    "<S> the hi  covers a region @xmath1 ( 62@xmath2 kpc@xmath3 ) and the total hi  mass detected is 2.5@xmath4 ( assuming an 18 mpc distance ) . </S>",
    "<S> the hi  is centered on ngc  1602 but appears to have two tidal tails , one of which crosses over ngc  1596 . </S>",
    "<S> the hi  located at the position of ngc  1596 has a velocity gradient in the same sense as the ionized gas , i.e. opposite to the stellar rotation . </S>",
    "<S> both the existence of a large gas reservoir and the velocity gradient of the hi  and the ionized gas strongly suggest that the ionized gas in ngc  1596 originated from ngc  1602 . from the length of the hi  tails </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the interaction started at least 1 gyr ago , but the unsettled , asymmetric distribution of the ionized gas suggests that the accretion occured more recently . </S>",
    "<S> ngc  1596 thus provides a good example where the presence of counter - rotating gas can be directly linked to an accretion event . </S>",
    "<S> after the accretion has stopped or the merging is complete , ngc  1596 may evolve to a system with more extended counter - rotating gas but no obvious signature of interaction . </S>",
    "<S> there is a substantial local hi  peak in one of the two tails , where we also find a faint stellar counterpart . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath5/@xmath6  ratio in this region is too high for a normal dwarf elliptical or a low surface brightness galaxy , so we conclude that a tidal dwarf is currently forming there .    </S>",
