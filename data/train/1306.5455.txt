    "ultra - cold neutrons ( ucn ) are neutrons with energies ( @xmath10 nev ) low enough to be trapped by suitable material and magnetic bottles@xcite . due to long storage times ( several hundred seconds or more ) , precise measurements of the neutron s properties use ucn , and these measurements have implications for the theory of weak interactions and physics beyond the standard model@xcite .",
    "many of these experiments are statistically limited , and research of improved materials and technologies is necessary to develop new and intense ucn sources .",
    "several planned ucn sources use solid deuterium ( d@xmath1 ) to down - scatter cold or thermal neutrons to ucn energies@xcite . since it was first proposed and investigated@xcite , considerable recent effort has gone into understanding ucn production in d@xmath1@xcite .",
    "deuterium is chosen for its low neutron absorption cross - section , low incoherent scattering cross - section ( to minimize ucn elastic scattering within the source ) , and the presence of numerous phonon modes which can inelastically scatter neutrons down to ucn energies .",
    "however , aside from these phonon modes , the free rotation of d@xmath1 molecules can cause incoherent up - scattering ( i.e. loss ) of ucn in the deuterium . in order to suppress this up - scattering ,",
    "the d@xmath1 sample is converted to the @xmath11 ( ortho ) state using paramagnetic catalysts@xcite .",
    "solid @xmath9n@xmath1 is a potential alternative to deuterium : its absorption cross - section is only @xmath12% of that of d@xmath1 , and it has a negligible incoherent scattering cross - section .",
    "additionally , rotation of the n@xmath1 molecules in the lattice is inhibited due to the anisotropy of the n@xmath1 inter - molecular potential .",
    "this leads to dispersive modes for the rotational degrees of freedom ( librons ) which provide additional channels for neutron down - scattering , and eliminates the rotational incoherent up - scattering prevalent in d@xmath1 .",
    "due to the primarily classical nature of its inter - molecular potential , the anharmonicity of the angular degrees of freedom , and phonon / libron coupling , solid nitrogen has been a testing - ground for _ ab initio _ lattice and molecular dynamics calculations@xcite .",
    "several models exist which utilize inter - molecular or atom - atom potentials of various forms@xcite , and anharmonic effects have also been investigated experimentally and theoretically@xcite .",
    "past interest notwithstanding , there is little data on the dynamical structure factor of @xmath2-n@xmath1 from neutron scattering@xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we present a measurement of the dynamics of @xmath9n@xmath1 using neutron scattering in order to investigate the performance of nitrogen as a ucn converter . the dynamical structure factor @xmath13",
    "is measured using the time - of - flight ( tof ) technique ; the total scattering cross - section is then analyzed to determine the absolute intensity of the scattering . from this , the cross - section to convert neutrons to ucn energy is computed .",
    "the dynamical structure factor is measured using the in4 tof spectrometer at the institut laue langevin ( ill ) using incident neutrons of wavelength @xmath14@xcite . the sample environment ,",
    "cryostat , and sample control system are the same as that used for previous studies of oxygen and deuterium as ucn converters@xcite .",
    "this provides a means of direct comparison between the different converters . gaseous @xmath0n@xmath1 ( 99.4% isotopic purity )",
    "is introduced into the @xmath15 mm annular cell through a needle valve , and condensed using the ill s orange helium - exchange cryostat ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the detector array is calibrated using an isotropically scattering vanadium sample .",
    "the dynamical structure factor and related quantities are computed using the ill s standard data treatment software lamp@xcite .",
    "total scattering from the sample cell is measured while condensing nitrogen to assure that the cell is completely filled , and the sample temperature is then lowered to the solid @xmath2-phase . in order to ensure that the nitrogen sample did not consist of macro - crystals ,",
    "the elastic scattering intensity is analyzed for various annealing times at the @xmath16 phase transition .",
    "we find little variation in the elastic peaks for different annealing times .",
    "data are then acquired with nitrogen at temperatures of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 k. a background measurement of the empty cell is performed at @xmath18 k. the inelastic scattering background due to the aluminum phonons is temperature dependent , especially on the anti - stokes ( @xmath22 ) side , according to the bose - einstein occupation factor @xmath23^{-1}$ ] .",
    "we thus rescale the background intensity by the relative change in occupation number ( as a function of @xmath24 ) prior to subtracting it from the nitrogen data .",
    "this is particularly important for computing ucn up - scattering mean free path for @xmath25 k ( see below ) , where it is a @xmath8% effect if uncorrected .",
    "we also perform measurements using @xmath26n@xmath1 , and find that the dynamical structure is the same as that for @xmath0n@xmath1 , with a difference in scattering intensity commensurate with the isotopic difference in total scattering cross - section ( @xmath27 ) . for this reason ,",
    "data with @xmath26n@xmath1 are used for the determination of the temperature dependence of the dynamical structure factor due to the accumulation of better statistics .",
    "the results are scaled by the above factor to determine the absolute @xmath0n@xmath1 cross - sections .",
    "@xmath28 corresponds to energy loss , and @xmath22 to energy gain .",
    "the vertical scale is set by integrating to the total scattering cross - section ( see text ) . ]",
    "the differential scattering cross - section @xmath29 is shown in fig .",
    "the vertical scale factor @xmath30 is set by demanding that @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the total scattering cross - section per molecule .",
    "we find @xmath33 b , with the @xmath20% uncertainty due primarily to the unknown contribution of scattering intensity outside the kinematic range of the instrument .",
    "the factor @xmath30 has units of barns so as to convert the @xmath34 data ( which has an arbitrary normalization ) into a cross - section .",
    "this normalization factor is used below to calculate the absolute ucn production and up - scattering cross - sections .    the dynamical structure factor @xmath13 ( averaged over orientations of @xmath35 due to the polycrystallinity of the sample ) is shown in fig .",
    "the intensity at @xmath36 has peaks at @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 mev , in reasonable agreement with the t@xmath40 , a@xmath41 , and t@xmath41 modes predicted by kjems and dolling@xcite .",
    "however , it is difficult to comprehensively compare the data to various dynamical models due to the low energy resolution of the tof method , as well as the polycrystalline nature of the sample .",
    "the color scale is set by integrating the measured differential cross - section and equating it to the total scattering cross - section .",

    "[ gdos ] shows the generalized density - of - states ( gdos ) , which exhibits prominent peaks from one - phonon states , and broad low - lying intensity due to multi - phonon processes .",
    "elastic contamination is removed by fitting the gdos to @xmath42 for @xmath43 mev .",
    "the peaks in the @xmath44 to @xmath39 mev range broaden with increasing temperature due to phonon and libron conversion and dephasing , which has been studied experimentally in detail using infrared and raman spectroscopy@xcite .",
    "peak broadening at higher temperature is observed . ]",
    "the black line in fig .",
    "[ sqe ] corresponds to the kinematical condition necessary for ucn down - scattering .",
    "as ucn energies are much less than cold and thermal neutron energies , we take the ucn energy @xmath45 and arrive at the following relation for the wave - vector transfer @xmath46 and energy transfer @xmath47 : @xmath48 with the plus sign for ucn production , and minus sign for ucn up - scattering .    the intensity of @xmath13 parameterized along the curve given in eqn .",
    "[ parabola ] is then proportional to the cross - section to nearly `` stop '' a cold neutron , thereby converting it to a ucn .",
    "the ucn production cross - section versus incident energy integrated over final ucn energy @xmath49 from @xmath50 to some maximum ucn energy @xmath51 is given by    @xmath52    upon escaping the nitrogen volume , ucn are boosted by the solid @xmath0n@xmath1 fermi potential of @xmath53 nev .",

    "[ sigmaucn ] .",
    "production peaks near @xmath59 mev , most probably due to a combination of vibrational and librational down - scattering channels .",
    "the production cross - section can vary with temperature due to the temperature dependence of normal mode frequencies and their widths in the @xmath2-phase : we find the variation in the cross - section to be no more than @xmath60% in the range of @xmath12 to @xmath21 k ( increasing slightly with increasing temperature ) .",

    "the yield in ucn is optimized for incident neutrons at a temperature @xmath65 k. ]    from the above , an estimated rate of ucn production in a source using @xmath0n@xmath1 can be estimated , making reasonable assumptions about the incident neutron flux .",
    "for a ucn source illuminated with the neutron flux from a cold moderator at temperature @xmath64 , we define the ucn yield to be @xmath66 where @xmath67 @xmath68 is the number density of @xmath0n@xmath1 , and the cold neutron flux is given by @xmath69 from this , we find an optimal moderator temperature of @xmath70 k ( see fig . [ yield ] ) . for a ucn source with total incident cold neutron flux flux",
    "@xmath71 @xmath62 s@xmath63 at @xmath65 k , the yield is approximately @xmath72 ucn per second per @xmath73 of source volume .    in order to extract a ucn from the source for use in an experiment , its mean free path @xmath74 must be comparable to or larger than the thickness of the source .",
    "the mean free path contains contributions from different processes :    @xmath75    where @xmath76 corresponds to ucn up - scattering to non - ucn energies , @xmath77 to nuclear absorption , and @xmath78 to ucn elastically scattering within the nitrogen volume . even for relatively poor isotopic purity ,",
    "the incoherent scattering mean free path is negligibly long .",
    "the absorption mean free path is highly dependent on the isotopic purity , and purity @xmath79% or higher is necessary for up - scattering to be the dominant contribution to the mean free path .     for ucn to up - scatter to non - ucn energies within the solid nitrogen volume .",
    "the error bars are statistical . ]",
    "the ( temperature dependent ) up - scattering cross - section of ucn in the nitrogen can be computed from the data by choosing the minus sign in eqn .",
    "[ parabola ] and integrating over the final state energy : @xmath80 we compute @xmath81 for ucn with @xmath82 nev for a range of temperatures ( see fig .",
    "[ mfp ] ) .",
    "we observe an increased @xmath76 with decreasing temperature due to the smaller population of lattice modes that can induce up - scattering . at @xmath7",
    "k , the data suggest an up - scattering mean free path of approximately @xmath6 cm , which is greater than the thickness of d@xmath1 sources , such as the los alamos source ( @xmath83 cm ) or the psi source ( @xmath84 cm)@xcite . the thickness of a ucn source using @xmath0n@xmath1 could therefore be made larger than a d@xmath1 source , the latter of which is limited by its @xmath39 cm incoherent scattering mean free path .",
    "the dynamical structure factor of solid @xmath9n@xmath1 has been measured over a range of temperatures . no appreciable difference in dynamics",
    "is observed between @xmath26n@xmath1 and @xmath0n@xmath1 , and there is reasonable qualitative agreement between our data and previous studies of the dynamics of solid @xmath2-nitrogen .",
    "however , a higher resolution neutron scattering technique would be necessary to thoroughly investigate the rich structure of the vibrational and librational modes .    the absolute ucn production cross - section is determined by normalizing the scattered intensity to the total molecular cross - section of the sample .",
    "the cross - section peaks strongly near @xmath59 mev , and the optimal incident cold neutron temperature is @xmath70 k. the measured cross - section is found to be somewhat lower than that of d@xmath1 and o@xmath1 ( see @xcite ) . however , we observe an up - scattering mean free path substantially longer than that of d@xmath1 .",
    "thus , for sufficiently high isotopic purity , an @xmath9n@xmath1 source could be large while maintaining efficient ucn extraction to compensate for the lower production cross - section .",
    "further , a nitrogen - based source may benefit from operating temperatures below those used here , if the up - scattering cross - section can be further reduced at lower temperatures ( @xmath85 k ) .",
    "while deuterium is ultimately limited by its temperature independent absorption and incoherent scattering mean free paths , further improved isotopic purity of @xmath0n may make an even lower temperature nitrogen volume a promising candidate for a new ucn source .",
