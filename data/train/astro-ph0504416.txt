    "several different types of astrophysical observations , _ e.g. _ @xcite , have established the evidence that the expansion of the universe entered a phase of acceleration . associated with this acceleration",
    "is a cosmological constant , or another dark energy component , that contributes significantly to the total energy density of the universe .",
    "cosmic acceleration and dark energy constitute one of the most important and challenging of current problems in cosmology and other areas of physics .",
    "there are many comprehensive reviews of the cosmological constant or dark energy , including the observational evidence for it and the problems associated with it , and we refer the reader to some of them @xcite .",
    "three questions related to the cosmic acceleration are encountered in the published literature , two of which are found in different formulations or expressions .",
    "these are :    \\i ) what is causing the cosmic acceleration ?",
    "is it a cosmological constant or a dynamical dark energy component @xcite ?",
    "is this associated with the stress - energy momentum sector or with the curvature sector of the einstein field equations ( efe ) ? is this an indication of new physics at cosmological scales ?",
    "\\ii ) the old cosmological constant problem : if the acceleration is caused by vacuum energy , then why is the value measured from astrophysics so small compared to values obtained from quantum field theory calculations ( this is the puzzling smallness formulation , see for example @xcite ) ?",
    "another formulation is : why do all the contributions to the effective cosmological constant term cancel each other up to a very large number of decimal places ( this is the fantastic cancelation formulation , see for example @xcite ) ?",
    "we contrast the two formulations in the next section .",
    "\\iii ) the new cosmological constant problem : why is the acceleration happening during the present epoch of the cosmic evolution ? ( any earlier would have prevented structures from forming in the universe . ) this is also formulated as the cosmic coincidence : i.e. why is the dark energy density of the same order of magnitude as the matter density during the present time ?    in this paper , we argue that questioning the formulation of these problems and challanging the underlying assumptions may proove useful and necessary in order to make progress on the questions .",
    "we start by discussing the cosmic coincidence problem and then make some clarifications using some fraction calculations .",
    "then , we calculate some prospective constraints on the cosmological parameters of dark energy / cosmological constant and discuss the inferred possible answers .",
    "constraining the equation of state parameters is certainly an important approach to persue , however , as we show , the level of precision required is very challanging , and yet the approach is limited in the kind of answers it could provide .",
    "this points out the need for new approaches to dark energy / cosmological constant problems .",
    "in particular , questioning the assumptions underlying these questions may be found useful in order to look for new types of tests or approaches to these problems .",
    "we provide an example where cosmological probes of the cosmic expansion and the growth rate of large - scale struture - formation can be used in order to distinguish between cosmic acceleration due to dark energy and cosmic acceleration due to some modification to general relativity at cosmological scales .",
    "next , we question the full identification of the cosmological constant with vacuum energy in light of some theorems on the most general curvature tensor in the einstein field equations . then",
    ", we discuss how a simple intrinsic constant curvature of spacetime would fit within important interpretations of general relativity s principles .",
    "finally , we point out the relevance of experiments at the interface of particle physics and astrophysics , such as the casimir effect in astrophysical and cosmological contexts .",
    "a discussion and conclusion are provided in the last section .",
    "we recall here only some preliminary equations and definitions necessary for the clarity of the paper .",
    "we refer the reader to review papers , see e.g. @xcite and text books , see e.g. @xcite . the einstein field equations ( efe ) with a cosmological constant @xmath0 read @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the einstein tensor , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the ricci tensor , the ricci curvature scalar and the metric tensor respectively . for a perfect fluid , the energy - momentum tensor is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the four velocity vector and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the energy - density and isotropic pressure relative to @xmath8 .",
    "with global isotropy , when @xmath11 , the efe ( [ eq : efe ] ) admit de sitter space ( for @xmath12 ) as a solution , for which a line element is given by ( [ eq : desitter ] ) in the appendix .",
    "motivated by current observations , e.g. @xcite , and for the sake of simplicity , let us consider the concordance spatially flat universe with a positive cosmological constant @xmath0 .",
    "the efe ( [ eq : efe ] ) with a dust source can be solved explicitly to give @xmath13}^{2/3}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is a constant ; and the spacetime line element is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "at early stages , the universe is matter dominated and @xmath17 . at late stages ,",
    "the universe is dominated by the cosmological constant and enters a de sitter phase with @xmath18 .",
    "we plot the curvature evolution and profile of these spacetimes in the appendix .",
    "now , to introduce the vacuum energy density , let us consider a scalar field with lagrangian density @xmath19 and energy momentum tensor @xmath20 the lowest energy density of the field configuration is when the kinetic ( or gradient ) term vanishes and the potential is at the minimum @xmath21 .",
    "the energy momentum ( [ eq : vact1 ] ) reduces to @xmath22 this form of @xmath23 is also the only lorentz - invariant form for the vacuum energy .",
    "the common identification of the cosmological constant with the vacuum energy density is based on the mathematical equivalence of the vacuum energy momentum tensor ( [ eq : vact2 ] ) and the cosmological constant term on the lhs of the efe ( [ eq : efe ] ) . also ,",
    "writing a lagrangian density that includes gravitational terms and terms from quantum field theory leads to the temptation to combine some of these terms ; however , one should bear in mind that we do nt have such a unified theory yet .    now",
    ", if one considers that a geometrical cosmological constant term is an integral part of the efe then the old cosmological constant problem can be expressed as ( see for example @xcite ) : why do all the contributions from vacuum energy density fantastically cancel with the geometrical @xmath0 term ?",
    "this formulation of the problem seems to be less often recalled in some of the recent literature . to see this quantitatively",
    ", one can combine equations ( [ eq : efe ] ) and ( [ eq : vact2 ] ) to write @xmath24 where from effective quantum field theory @xmath25 now , if one considers only quantum field fluctuations cut off at particle energies of 100 gev ( this means , we consider only the well known physics of the standard model ) , one can write ( with @xmath26 ) @xmath27 .",
    "however , from astrophysical observations @xmath28 is found to be comparable to the critical density , i.e. @xmath29 @xmath30 which means that the two terms in the rhs of ( [ eq : effective ] ) must cancel to 56 decimal places .    on the other hand , from the identification of the cosmological constant with the vacuum energy ,",
    "the old @xmath0 problem becomes : why is the vacuum energy measured from astrophysics ( @xmath31 @xmath30 ) so small compared to the value of the vacuum energy estimated from quantum field theory ( @xmath32 ) ?",
    "of course , the situation is made even worse by taking the gut or planck scales .",
    "this full identification may bring some limitations of its own to the old cosmological constant problem and is questioned later in this work .",
    "the cosmic coincidence problem is usually stated as why is the cosmic acceleration recent in the cosmic history of the universe ( why `` now '' ? ) it is also discussed in terms of a fine tuning problem : i.e. why is the matter energy density of the same order of magnitude as the dark energy density at the present epoch ? related to this question is the fact that if the dark energy density was much larger then what is measured it would have dominated over the matter energy density much earlier and prevented structures from forming in the universe .",
    "it is important to discuss the cosmic coincidence because it is an argument that is used to motivate the search for dynamical components in order to be able to explain the coincidence .",
    "we will try to quantify some of these statements here .",
    "the matter energy density is related to the redshift by @xmath33 and in a @xmath0cdm universe @xmath34 where @xmath35 is normalized to 1 today .",
    "now , from the concordance model @xmath36 and @xmath37 today and it follows that @xmath38 at the transition from deceleration to acceleration the dark energy density is half the matter energy density and @xmath39 ( see for a first measurement of this @xcite : @xmath40 ) .",
    "it is a clarifying exercise to evaluate the age of the universe @xmath41 at this transition . using ( [ age ] )",
    "gives a transition age of @xmath42 billion years ( we use @xmath43 @xcite ) , showing that the transition is not that recent in the time history of the universe .",
    "moreover , @xmath44 and @xmath45 have been within the same order of magnitude starting roughly from @xmath46 ( with @xmath47 ) and that corresponds to an age of the universe of @xmath48 billion years .",
    "i.e. @xmath44 and @xmath45 have been within the same order of magnitude for at least the last 10.32 billions years of the time history of the universe .    in order to evaluate how much fine - tuning the cosmic coincidence represents",
    ", one could evaluate some informative fractions using the transition time or the period during which dark energy has been of the same order of magnitude as the matter energy density , compared to the whole history of the universe .",
    "these fractions provide the percent chances for an observer randomly put in the time history of the universe to have the matter energy density and the dark energy density being of the same order of magnitude .",
    "we will compare energy densities using a logarithmic scale of time , so the results will be similar to those using a logarithmic redshift scale .    on a logarithmic scale , things can appear very significant on plots ; however , the fractions are actually of a few percent : @xmath49 @xmath50 and @xmath51 we used here @xmath52 as we considered observational constraints from the big bang nucleosynthesis and cmb results to trace back in time the universe up to 1 second at the @xmath53 annihilation .",
    "we also use the planck time @xmath54 and find that the fraction is @xmath55 .",
    "( of course on a linear scale of time the coincidence is insignificant : @xmath56 and @xmath57    in summary , even on a logarithmic scale the fractions remain of the order of a few percent . this is significant but not totally unusual in physics and astrophysics .",
    "consequently , while it remains perhaps a motivated problem to seek models that could naturally explain some of these small fractions , this fine tuning should not constitute a barrier to reject models that address successfully the other cosmological constant problems .",
    "an important approach to the cosmological constant questions is to parameterize the dark energy using its equation of state , and then to use different cosmological data sets in order to determine these parameters .",
    "one can thus infer answers to the cosmological constant / dark energy questions from the values found for these parameters . as we will delineate further",
    ", some results will be more conclusive than others .",
    "it is essential to combine multiple complementary cosmological probes and techniques in order to break degeneracies between the cosmological parameters including the dark energy parameter space .",
    "a powerful combination for constraining the dark energy parameters is the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) plus distance measurements from the type ia supernovae ( snie ) and weak gravitational lensing ( wl ) also called cosmic shear , e.g. see .",
    "these probes provide orthogonal constraints that , when combined , reduce significantly the uncertainties on the individual parameters .",
    "also , constraints from clusters of galaxies and baryons oscillations were shown to be good probes of the dark energy equation of state , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "interestingly , wl allows one to do tomography by separating the source - galaxies into redshift bins in order to obtain further improvements on the parameter constraints , see e.g. @xcite . in this analysis",
    ", we consider future constraints from the cmb+snie+wl combination plus wl tomography with various numbers of redshift bins .",
    ".cosmological model .",
    "we use fiducial values for the parameters from recent results from the wmap ( 3-years data results ) + large scale structure + supernova data as listed in table [ tab : surveys ] with the respective references ( we use for the equation of state the cosmological constant parameter values ) .",
    "we assume a spatially flat universe with @xmath58 .",
    "this fixes @xmath59 and @xmath60 as functions of the basic parameters .",
    "we do not include massive neutrinos , or primordial isocurvature perturbations . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in cartesian coordinates , these are : @xmath61\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath62\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the time evolution of the @xmath63 components is shown in figure [ fig : frwdesitterriemann12]a where it starts with a power law decrease to reach a negative range exponential decrease during a de sitter phase . for comparison , the no-@xmath64 curve shows how this component continues with power law decrease within a positive range .        at large @xmath67",
    ", it tends to the de sitter space limit .",
    "the explicit de sitter case is obtained by setting @xmath68 while the explicit schwarzschild case is obtained by setting @xmath69 . here , for ( [ eq : schwdesitter ] ) @xmath70 and",
    "is plotted in figure ( [ fig : schwdesitterriemsq ] ) where the curvature due to the central mass @xmath71 decreases as a function of r and is overtaken by the @xmath0 term at very large @xmath67 .",

    "<S> associated with the cosmic acceleration are the old and new cosmological constant problems , recently put into the more general context of the dark energy problem . in broad terms , the old problem is related to an unexpected order of magnitude of this component while the new problem is related to this magnitude being of the same order of the matter energy density during the present epoch of cosmic evolution . </S>",
    "<S> current plans to measure the equation of state or density parameters certainly constitute an important approach ; however , as we discuss , this approach is faced with serious feasibility challenges and is limited in the type of conclusive answers it could provide . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , is it really too early to seek actively for new tests and approaches to these problems ? in view of the difficulty of this endeavor , we argue in this work that a good place to start is by questioning some of the assumptions underlying the formulation of these problems and finding new ways to put this questioning to the test . </S>",
    "<S> first , we calculate how much fine tuning the cosmic coincidence problem represents . </S>",
    "<S> next , we discuss the potential of some cosmological probes such as weak gravitational lensing to identify novel tests to probe dark energy questions and assumptions and provide an example of consistency tests . </S>",
    "<S> then , motivated by some theorems in general relativity , we discuss if the full identification of the cosmological constant with vacuum energy is unquestionable . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss some implications of the simplest solution for the principles of general relativity . </S>",
    "<S> also , we point out the relevance of experiments at the interface of astrophysics and quantum field theory , such as the casimir effect in gravitational and cosmological contexts . we conclude that challenging some of the assumptions underlying the cosmological constant problems and putting them to the test may prove useful and necessary to make progress on these questions . </S>"
