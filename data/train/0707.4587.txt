    "numerical prediction of the properties and behaviour of quantum mechanical systems is a long standing challenge .",
    "a major difficulty stems from the high dimensions of such systems .",
    "an @xmath0 particle mechanical system generally has @xmath1 degrees of freedom , and so to calculate the state of an @xmath0 particle quantum system we must solve a pde in @xmath2 variables . presently , the limit is @xmath3 particles ( @xmath4 @xmath5 variables ) in the largest systems for which many eigenvalues / eigenstates were obtained from schrdinger s equation @xcite .",
    "however , there are many larger systems for which numerical predictions would be very useful for chemistry , biology ( where many important molecules have more than five atoms ) , and for the emerging field of nano engineering .",
    "clearly , we would like to push the limit further .    to efficiently treat multi - d ( @xmath4 multi variable ) pdes",
    "we must consider the function spaces where approximations are constructed .",
    "naively , we can form such function spaces by taking tensor products of 1-d function spaces .",
    "many of the 1-d spaces standardly used ( @xmath6 fourier spaces , spaces of orthogonal polynomials of different kinds ) have a basis of localized functions peaked above the nodes of a 1-d quadrature formula , these are called 1-d dvrs @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the corresponding multi - d dvr basis of the product space consists of localized multi variable functions peaked above the points of @xmath7 , the ( hyper ) rectangular array of nodes of the associated product cubature formula .",
    "typically , at least @xmath8 1-d dvr basis functions are taken for each variable , so the dimension of the product space is at least @xmath9 .",
    "this gets much too large , even when the number of particles @xmath10 is not too big .",
    "dvr bases can give us some insight regarding the inefficiency of multi - d tensor product spaces .",
    "bound solutions of schrdinger s eigenproblem decay exponentially in high potential regions .",
    "thus , for a given system we can apriori estimate @xmath11 , the region where wavefunctions up to a given energy ( eigenvalue ) are supported . typically , @xmath11 is non rectangular and covering it with the rectangular grid @xmath7 is inefficient .",
    "many nodes will be outside @xmath11 and therefore many of the multi - d product dvr basis functions will contribute little to the approximation of our wavefunctions .",
    "evidently , efficient localized basis functions should be peaked in @xmath11 , and not outside it .",
    "several approaches have been suggested for obtaining such basis functions .",
    "one very useful solution is to prune a product dvr basis by discarding functions whose nodes lie in high potential regions @xcite .",
    "another approach , still in its initial stages , is to construct dvrs based on non product cubatures with various non rectangular node distributions @xcite . in both cases",
    "the resulting dvr basis functions are orthogonal .",
    "however , in these approaches it is not easy to refine the node distribution @xmath12 @xmath11 according to predictable wavefunction properties .",
    "generally , wavefunctions are more oscillatory in low potential regions compared to high ones and node densities in @xmath11 should vary accordingly . therefore we may try to construct function spaces by appropriately distributing nodes and then placing a localized basis function above each",
    ". gaussians @xcite @xcite @xcite , b - splines @xcite , and inverse multi quadrics @xcite , have been used in this way .",
    "although the resulting basis functions are not orthogonal , the flexible choice of nodes and basis function shape parameters can give highly accurate results .",
    "this has been illustrated in 1-d problems @xcite @xcite .",
    "however the only general method we are aware of for constructing multi - d bases of localized functions whose node density varies with potential values is given by garashchuk and light @xcite .",
    "here we closely examine the method of @xcite for choosing nodes and widths of gaussian basis functions .",
    "their basis functions are narrow and close together in low potential regions , while they are wide and sparsely distributed in high potential regions .",
    "we believe that this needs to be refined in steep potential regions , where points with low and high potential values are very close together .",
    "this situation is common in molecular potential surfaces for small nuclear separation .",
    "we suggest a simple modification of the nodes / widths choice of @xcite . its essence is to avoid overly wide and sparse basis functions in hard potential regions .",
    "we illustrate that this can give a dramatic improvement in accuracy by calculating the eigenfucntions and eigenvalues of two 1-d morse hamiltonians .",
    "our results indicate that the algorithm of @xcite should be adapted along these lines in the multi - d case .",
    "our work also explores the use of collocation with gaussian basis functions .",
    "using collocation , rather than the standard galerkin approach , is very appealing since calculating integrals of potential matrix elements is avoided .",
    "yang and peet have previously used collocation with gaussian basis functions @xcite , and in their calculations performance was similiar to the galerkin approach .",
    "they have used the same basis functions with both methods . however in our calculations basis function widths were adjusted optimally for each method and galerkin accuracy was much better than collocation .",
    "collocation has many advantages and it can give high quality results as shown in the work of yang and peet @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and in many papers based on it .",
    "however , our results illustrate that caution should be exercised before embracing collocation as equally accurate to galerkin .",
    "other aspects we examine are the use of collocation with the quasi randomly distributed gaussians of @xcite , and using the deviation from orthogonality of eigenfunctions calculated by collocation to guide us in the choice of basis function widths .",
    "the content of this paper follows . in section [ distgaussbases ]",
    "we describe the distributed gaussian bases used for schrodinger s equation leading up to @xcite , then we overview the collocation approach . in section [ obssug ]",
    "we discuss the nodes / widths choice of @xcite , suggest improvements , and raise a few further questions about collocation and gaussian basis functions . section [ numex ] gives numerical results for two 1-d morse hamiltonians .",
    "finally , we conclude and suggest some future directions in section [ conclude ] .",
    "here we discuss the application of distributed gaussian bases and collocation in the schrdinger eigenproblem , @xmath4 the problem of finding eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian operator = - + v(x )  .",
    "[ tise ] we concentrate on the problem of finding all bound states below an energy cutoff @xmath13 , @xmath4 all eigenfunctions @xmath14 and eigenvalues @xmath15 belonging to the discrete part of the spectrum with @xmath16 .",
    "several researchers have studied the use of gaussian basis functions for this problem b - splines have much greater errors compared to results obtained with @xmath17 gaussians in @xcite , @xcite , and in section [ numex ] here ( to be fair we note that the morse hamiltonians were not identical ) . moreover ,",
    "it is illustrated numerically in the first reference of @xcite that eigenvalue errors using @xmath10 gaussians scale as @xmath18 while the error using @xmath10 b - splines of order @xmath19 scales as @xmath20 , @xmath4 the gaussian error converges asymptotically faster .",
    "a thorough analytical and numerical investigation of using high order b - splines in schrdingers equation is certainly in place .",
    "however , we presently opt for gaussians because of the reasons given above , and because the lessons on node / width distributions we obtain using gaussians will probably be useful for other types of basis functions including b - splines . ] .",
    "we pick up an important thread in this research by considering the work of hamilton and light @xcite , and continuing to poirier and light @xcite , and to garashchuk and light @xcite .",
    "the basis functions used in @xcite are real gaussians _",
    "i(x ) = _ i ^-c w_i ( x - x_i)^2 i=1 ,  , n [ gausbasisf ] whose parameters are named as follows .",
    "* @xmath21 is called the center or node of @xmath22 .",
    "* @xmath23 is the width parameter of @xmath22 .",
    "* @xmath24 is the `` global '' width parameter . *",
    "the normalization parameter @xmath25 is chosen so that @xmath26 .",
    "much depends , of course , on the choice of the @xmath27 parameters @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 . for 1-d problems",
    "classical mechanics arguments are used in @xcite to construct very efficient bases , `` tailored '' to a given problem . however",
    ", such arguments are not readily extended to multi - d , and a simpler approach is applied in @xcite in this case .",
    "its rationale can be explained as follows .",
    "the highest eigenfunction with energy ( approximately ) @xmath13 is the most oscillatory in low potential regions , while reaching furthest out to high potential regions .",
    "therefore a basis suitable for its approximation will be suitable for all lower eigenfunctions .",
    "the most severe oscillations appear near the potential minimum where the local de - broglie wavelength is @xmath31 .",
    "thus the @xmath30 are chosen in @xcite as points of a regular grid whose spacing is at most @xmath32 of this de - broglie wavelength ( any sufficiently fine spacing would do ) .",
    "on the other hand , the highest eigenfunction is exponentially decaying in the classically forbidden region where @xmath33 , thus the @xmath21 are confined to the classically accessible region @xmath34 .",
    "regular grids are used in @xcite which allow an easy notion of grid spacing , however this is by no means a restriction to rectangular grids . for the henon - heiles problem",
    "the @xmath21 chosen in @xcite are points of a regular hexagonal grid pruned to fit within the classically accessible triangular region . regarding width parameters ,",
    "the choice @xmath35 , is advocated in @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that this choice arises if we require the curvature of the @xmath22 at their centers @xmath21 ( @xmath4 @xmath36 ) to be compatible with the maximal curvature of the highest eigenfunction .",
    "having chosen the @xmath37 we can still vary the global width parameter @xmath28 . let us define the matrix @xmath38 by s_ij = _ i | _ j  . in @xcite",
    "the most accurate hamiltonian eigenvalues are obtained for low @xmath28 values for which the condition number of @xmath38 is large while still allowing stable numerical calculations .",
    "hamilton and light @xcite provide efficient gaussian bases whose centers occupy only relevant regions of configuration space .",
    "however , for multi - d problems the density of centers in @xcite is constant , and dictated by the highest oscillations in the problem .",
    "such high center density is necessary only in the lowest potential regions . as in the 1-d examples in @xcite we expect that sparser gaussian centers can be taken in higher potential regions",
    "this is the subject of @xcite , but we first discuss @xcite which provides the background for @xcite , and which unveils important , and surprising , properties of gaussian bases .    intuitively , we tend to reject badly conditioned basis functions which are `` almost linearly dependent '' .",
    "thus we may expect that `` good '' gaussian basis functions will not be `` too wide '' and their centers will not be `` too close '' together . in @xcite poirier and light",
    "show the contrary ; that `` good '' gaussian bases can actually have clustered centers and high condition numbers .",
    "they regard the choice of gaussian basis parameters as an optimization problem .",
    "let us define the matrix @xmath39 by h_ij = _ i | _ j  .",
    "poirier and light solve for widths and centers which minimize the functional @xmath40 .",
    "this is based on the `` variational principle '' : each eigenvalue of @xmath41 is smaller than the corresponding eigenvalue of @xmath42 , see macdonald @xcite .",
    "therefore minimizing @xmath40 is equivalent to minimizing eigenvalue errors .",
    "note that @xmath42 represents @xmath41 as a _ linear operator _ in the non - orthogonal gaussian basis , while @xmath39 represents the bilinear form @xmath43 .",
    "note also that including @xmath44 in our functional we ensure that the gaussians yielded by the optimization will be linearly independent , however their condition number is not constrained .",
    "an illumating example is provided by the 1-d harmonic oscillator , @xmath45 . rather than giving a `` well conditioned '' basis , the optimization produces gaussians which are small perturbations of the harmonic oscillator ground state @xmath46 , where @xmath47 .",
    "these basis functions have large overlaps , and it is reported in @xcite that they reproduce the harmonic oscillator eigenvalues to machine accuracy . at first this",
    "may seem surprising , but a simple explanation is provided in @xcite . the @xmath10th harmonic oscillator eigenstate is @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the @xmath10th hermite polynomial . using the formula @xmath50 ( from @xmath6 @xcite ) we see that @xmath51 , and therefore @xmath52 is in @xmath53 .",
    "consider now the space mentioned above of gaussians closely clustered near the potential minimum .",
    "it contains difference approximations to the derivatives @xmath54 , and since the centers are close together the accuracy of these difference approximations is high .",
    "therefore @xmath10 closely clustered translations of the ground state span a linear space which gives excellent approximations of the first @xmath10 harmonic oscillator eigenstates .",
    "clustering of optimal gaussian centers is observed in @xcite also for a morse potential , however in this case there are several clustering locations away from the potential minimum .",
    "the high condition number of such optimal gaussian bases can be problematic in practical large scale calculations .",
    "however , the harmonic oscillator example indicates that high overlaps are needed only to produce accurate approximations of gaussian derivatives .",
    "poirier and light therefore propose to include derivatives of gaussians among our basis functions to begin with , and so avoid the need for large gaussian overlaps .",
    "this direction is not pursued further in @xcite .",
    "instead , the bad conditioning of optimal gaussian bases is addressed by introducing a modified functional , trace(s^-1 h ) + s - i  . [ funcpl ] gaussians optimizing this functional strike a compromise , depending on the value of @xmath55 , between accuracy and conditioning .",
    "a similiar functional provides the starting point for @xcite .    in @xcite garashchuk and light suggest a practical way of constructing multi - d gaussian bases , whose node density varies with potential values .",
    "they define the functional trace(h ) + _ i j  , [ funcgl ] which is different from the functional ( [ funcpl ] ) used in @xcite .",
    "note particularly that @xmath40 from ( [ funcpl ] ) is replaced by @xmath56 in ( [ funcgl ] ) .",
    "this is minimized for 1-d",
    "morse and double well hamiltonians to find the density of optimal gaussian centers @xmath57 and their widths @xmath37 .",
    "it is then observed that @xmath58 and @xmath37 fit linear functions of the potential , @xmath4 there are constants @xmath59 such that @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "a similiar optimization for realistic large scale problems would be very time consuming . however , garashchuk and light regard these two 1-d examples as manifestations of a general rule : `` gaussian bases which have center density and width parameters fitting appropriate linear functions of the potential will be good '' .",
    "it is also observed in @xcite that hamiltonian eigenvalue errors decrease when the global width parameter @xmath28 is decreased until unstable numerical calculations set in when @xmath62 .",
    "based on these observations a simple procedure for choosing multi - d gaussian basis functions is suggested in @xcite . fixing @xmath13 and a parameter @xmath63",
    "they define the density function ( x ) = ( ) ^  .",
    "[ densitygl ] with @xmath64 the density @xmath65 depends linearly on the potential .",
    "the value @xmath66 is also considered in @xcite , in this case @xmath65 corresponds to the local de - broglie wave length of the highest eigenfunction . having defined @xmath67 candidate points @xmath68 are quasi - randomly generated in the region @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath68 is accepted as a gaussian center if ( x ) > r where @xmath69 $ ] is random . with the centers at hand ,",
    "the widths are defined w_i = e_max - v(x_i ) + > 0  . [ widthsgl ] then @xmath28 is taken as small as possible until @xmath70 .",
    "this approach is applied in @xcite to eigenvalue calculations of several multi - d hamiltonians .",
    "the results are much better , or not worse , compared to those of previous methods .",
    "therefore the quasi random distributed gaussians of @xcite appear to be a very good choice .",
    "it is our purpose here to make some further observations and suggest a few possible refinements of the approach of @xcite . among other things we shall use the gaussian basis functions of @xcite in a collocation algorithm , which we discuss next .",
    "the collocation approach for finding the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a hamiltonian @xmath41 may be described as follows .",
    "first , we choose basis functions @xmath71 , and a set of points @xmath72 called collocation nodes .",
    "we then seek functions @xmath73 , and eigenvalues @xmath74 , such that @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "this gives the following generalized matrix eigenproblem ( - + v ) u = e u , [ collgeq ] where @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "since the exact eigenvalues are real we reject solutions with complex @xmath74 , if there are any .",
    "assuming @xmath80 is invertible ( [ collgeq ] ) is equivalent to ( - ^-1 ( ) + ^-1 v ) u = e u [ collceq ] and changing coordinates to @xmath81 we obtain ( - ( ) ^-1 + v ) y = e y  .",
    "[ collyeq ] the matrix on the l.h.s . of ( [ collceq ] ) is the collocation representation of the hamiltonian in the @xmath22 basis , while the matrix on the l.h.s .",
    "of ( [ collyeq ] ) is the collocation representation in a basis @xmath82 , spanning the same function space , and consisting of functions which are @xmath83 on `` their '' node and zero on all other nodes , @xmath84 .",
    "the collocation approach for spatial discretization of differential operators has a long history @xcite .",
    "an important mile stone was the introduction of radial basis function ( rbf ) collocation by kansa @xcite , an approach which found much use in the pdes of classical physics . for recent reviews on radial basis functions and their applications",
    "see @xcite .",
    "rbfs have the form @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is a real valued function peaked at @xmath87 and depending on the parameter vector @xmath88 , @xmath6 @xmath89 giving gaussian rbfs , or @xmath90 ) = ( 1 + w_\\alpha^2 r^2)^{-w_\\beta/2}$ ] giving generalized inverse multi quadric ( gimq ) rbfs ( here @xmath91 where @xmath92 ) .",
    "the centers @xmath21 are usually chosen as the collocation nodes .",
    "the attraction of rbf collocation stems from its great flexibility and simplicity .",
    "the basis functions shape and location can be adapted to a given problem by carefully choosing parameters . moreover , the collocation equations are very simple to set up , they do not require calculation of multi dimensional integrals .    the need for efficient methods is particularly acute for high dimensional problems in quantum mechanics .",
    "yang and peet were the first to show that collocation is feasible for the schrdinger eigenproblem @xcite .",
    "they applied collocation to 1-d morse hamiltonians together with the gaussian rbfs of @xcite , and found that results were as good as the galerkin approach with the same basis functions .",
    "the rbf collocation of @xcite has become a standard method for 1-d schrdinger eigenproblems ( appearing as components in more complicated calculations ) . in multi - d problems collocation did not go , to the best of our knowledge , beyond the stage of initial explorations .",
    "collocation was used for a 2-d problem ( ar - hcl hamiltonian ) in @xcite with rectangular grids of nodes and tensor product function spaces .",
    "again , performance was similiar to that of a galerkin approach with the same basis functions . in @xcite collocation",
    "was used for the same 2-d problem with gaussian rbfs whose centers were obtained by truncation of a rectangular grid outside the classically accessible region . however , in @xcite only the first three eigenvalues were calculated using an iterative scheme based on projections to low dimensional subspaces .",
    "the only example we are aware of for calculation of high ( additionally to low ) lying eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of multi - d hamiltonians using rbf collocation is given by hu , ho , and rabitz @xcite .",
    "the nodes used in @xcite were on hexagonal and triangular grids and the basis functions were the gimq rbfs mentioned above .",
    "no direct comparison with the galerkin approach was given in @xcite .",
    "having surveyed the topics of gaussian rbfs and collocation for the schrdinger eigenproblem we can now venture to take a closer look at some aspects of these topics .",
    "here we give some observations and suggestions which arose while studying the application of gaussian rbf collocation to schrdinger equations .",
    "although the term rbfs is used below for gaussians , some of our observations may be relevant also for other types of rbfs .    1",
    ".   one of the few methods for constructing efficient function spaces for multi - d quantum problems is given by the quasi random distributed gaussians of @xcite .",
    "however , the choice made in @xcite for the width parameter of an rbf @xmath22 depends only on the potential value at _ a point _ , see equation [ widthsgl ] , while @xmath22 should capture solution properties in _ a neighborhood _ of @xmath21 .",
    "such properties correspond to the differing nature of the potential function in various regions .",
    "strong repulsions cause molecular potentials to rise very steeply when distance coordinates get small . on the other hand ,",
    "the smooth interaction of distant particles causes molecular potentials to be much softer for large values of distance coordinates . see for example the morse potential in figure [ fig1 ] , which is a standard model for two atom molecular potentials .",
    "+ a possible problem in the width choice of @xcite can be illustrated by considering two rbfs @xmath22 and @xmath93 such that @xmath94 are close to the cut off value @xmath13 , and such that @xmath21 is in the `` hard '' region of the morse potential while @xmath95 is in the `` soft '' one .",
    "our assumptions imply that @xmath22 and @xmath93 will have the same large width . in the soft region",
    "this is fine , wide basis functions are compatible with the smooth character of wavefunctions in this region .",
    "however a very wide basis function seems unsuitable in the hard region where wavefunction behaviour can change from severe oscillation to rapid decay over a short distance .",
    "we therefore conclude that rbfs centered in hard potential regions should generally be narrower than those centered in soft potential regions .",
    "this observation is supported by @xcite where widths and centers of @xmath96 gaussian rbfs ( w.r.t . functional ( [ funcpl ] ) ) are found for a morse potential . comparing centers with similiar potential values",
    "we see that the width for a center in the hard region is smaller than for a center in the soft region ( see particularly figure 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "recall that functional ( [ funcpl ] ) is different from functional ( [ funcgl ] ) used for optimizing rbf parameters in @xcite . while the reasoning giving ( [ funcpl ] )",
    "is clear , we find no similiar justification for ( [ funcgl ] ) . particularly , it is not clear why the representation of @xmath41 as a bilinear form , rather than a linear operator , appears in ( [ funcgl ] ) .",
    "+ we suggest that the parameter choice of @xcite may be emiliorated by appropriately decreasing the widths of rbfs , and increasing their density , in hard potential regions . one way to achieve",
    "this is to choose nodes and width parameters as in @xcite but using a modified potential .",
    "let us denote the classically accessible region by @xmath97 , the `` soft '' potential region by @xmath98 , and the `` hard '' potential region by @xmath99 .",
    "we define @xmath100 such that @xmath101 for @xmath102 , and such that @xmath100 has appropriately low values for @xmath103 .",
    "we may choose , for example , the value of @xmath104 in a nearby minimum or in the global one . in the classically inaccessible parts of @xmath99 we set @xmath105 , @xmath4",
    "we allow no nodes there .",
    "the nodes are then chosen similiarly to @xcite , but using @xmath100 instead of @xmath104 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] illustrates @xmath100 for a morse potential . in 1-d and 2-d problems",
    "this approach should not pose serious difficulty , the `` hard '' potential regions and nearby minima may be identified by inspection of the potential surface . in higher dimensions potential surface geometry is not so easy to visualize , yet",
    "simple ways may still exist for modifying the choice of nodes and width parameters .",
    "we defer their discussion to section [ conclude ] .",
    "2 .   in @xcite , where gaussian rbfs are used in galerkin eigenvalue calculations , it is observed that accuracy improves as the global width parameter @xmath28 is decreased until unstable calculations appear . therefore @xmath106 is used as an indicator for a good choice of @xmath28 ; @xmath28 is chosen so that @xmath106 is in the range @xmath107 .",
    "however , it is desirable that our choice of @xmath28 will relate to the accuracy of our results in a more direct way , and will give a narrower range of possible @xmath28 values .",
    "we therefore suggest a different approach for choosing @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath108 be a matrix whose columns give ( a few or many ) approximate eigenfunctions calculated using collocation in the gaussian rbf basis . since the exact eigenfunctions are orthonormal we suggest to use the `` collocation orthogonalization error '' @xmath109 as a performance indicator for the choice of @xmath28 in the collocation approach . to our surprise the values of @xmath28 minimizing the collocation orthogonalization error were close to those minimizing eigenfunction and eigenvalue errors also in the galerkin approach . another criterion for choosing @xmath28 based on hamiltonian trace minimization",
    "is suggested in section [ conclude ] .",
    "the simplicity of rbf collocation is very appealing . but",
    "how does collocation compare to the traditional galerkin approach ?",
    "it is reported in @xcite , @xcite that for their basis functions collocation accuracy is similiar to that of galerkin . they therefore conclude that collocation accuracy is similiar to that of galerkin . however , in all our numerical examples the best galerkin results were better than the best collocation results .",
    "+ another question is how collocation works together with the quasi randomly distributed gaussians of @xcite , @xmath4 how does performance compare to gaussians whose centers are distributed deterministically with the same density ? to the best of our knowledge this was not previously examined in the literature . in our numerical examples",
    "collocation performed generally worse with the quasi random centers .",
    "the suggestions and observations above were tested on two hamiltonians which we call morse a , and morse b. morse a , from @xcite , has potential @xmath110 which is plotted in figure [ fig1 ] , and parameters @xmath111 , @xmath112 .",

    "the average eigenvalue error _ v = _",

    "n^a - _ n _ l_2  , [ epsf ] were calculated for different values of the global width parameter @xmath28 .",
    "the superscript @xmath130 stands for `` approximate '' , and @xmath131 or @xmath132 for system a or b respectively .",
    "results are shown in figures [ fig4 ] , [ fig6 ]",
    ". these figures also illustrate the @xmath28 dependence of the collocation orthogonalization error u^ * s u - i _",
    "frobenius  , [ collortherr ] with @xmath108 being the @xmath133 matrix of eigenvectors calculated by collocation .",
    "table [ tabone ] gives @xmath106 and @xmath134 at the @xmath28 values minimizing @xmath135 for each basis set and discretization method .",
    "the only exception is in basis 2b were the minimizing @xmath28 values gave very ill conditioned bases .",
    "instead larger @xmath28 was taken so that @xmath70 as advocated in @xcite .",
    "for the different discretization methods and bases ( with the @xmath28 values of table [ tabone ] ) the logarithms of eigenvalue and eigenfunction errors are plotted against their index in figures [ fig5 ] , [ fig7 ] , [ fig101 ] , [ fig102 ] .",
    "figures [ fig101 ] and [ fig102 ] show that basis sets 3 gave orders of magnitude better results compared to basis sets 1 and 2 , except for a few high eigenfunctions / eigenvalues where accuracy was similiar .",
    "this indicates that indeed there is room for improvement in the method of @xcite for choosing nodes / widths in hard potential regions .",
    "moreover , the modification suggested here in basis set 3 can produce highly accurate results .",
    "the results for basis sets 1 and 3 in figures [ fig4 ] , [ fig6 ] , ( top and bottom rows ) indicate that it may be possible to choose the global width parameter @xmath28 based on the collocation orthogonalization error .",
    "the minimum of @xmath135 for collocation , and for galerkin , occurs near minima of the collocation `` orth err '' . in some cases",
    "these minima occur for @xmath28 values for which @xmath106 is not too large , see table [ tabone ] .",
    "this supports our notion that it is desirable to have a criterion for choosing @xmath28 which is more refined than reaching large @xmath106 .",
    "similiar relations between minima of @xmath135 and of the collocation orthogonalization error were not observed in basis sets 2 with the quasi randomly distributed nodes @xcite .",
    "the simplicity of collocation is an important advantage which can save much programing time .",
    "moreover , with a careful choice of basis function parameters collocation can give accurate results .",
    "however , figures [ fig5 ] , [ fig7 ] illustrate that in all our calculations the galerkin results were much more accurate than those of collocation .    examining the bottom row in figures [ fig101 ] , [ fig102 ]",
    ", we see that collocation errors were larger with bases 2a and 2b compared to bases 1a and 2a .",
    "that is , we see that larger errors appeared when using collocation with quasi random dgbs , compared to dgbs whose centers had the same density but were chosen deterministically .",
    "in this work several observations about gaussian radial basis functions and collocation in schrdinger eigenproblems were made and tested numerically .",
    "it may be hoped that the following conclusions are relevant not only for choosing good gaussian bases , but also for other types of localized radial basis functions .    in @xcite garashchuk and light",
    "give one of the few examples of efficient basis functions for multi - d schrdinger equations .",
    "an improvement of their approach may be obtained from our observation that the gaussians of @xcite are too wide in `` hard '' potential regions , @xmath6 where nuclei are close together in molecular potentials .",
    "this led us to suggest choosing nodes / weights using the method of @xcite , but with a modified potential function obtained by replacing steeply rising parts by `` vertical '' walls and flattening nearby valley regions .",
    "we emphasize that our goal is to produce basis functions which are not overly wide and sparse in hard potential regions .",
    "using the modified potential above is just one way to achieve this goal , others are suggested in the future directions below .",
    "our numerical tests indicate that the changes we propose in the choice of nodes / widths can give a dramatic improvement in accuracy .    in the literature we often encounter the conception that with appropriately wide basis functions collocation errors are not larger than those of galerkin @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . however , in our numerical tests the galerkin accuracy was better than that of collocation , often orders of magnitude better .",
    "the difference is probably because we have chosen the optimal global width parameter for each method , while in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite no special attempt was made to optimize @xmath28 .",
    "our calculations indicate that caution should be exercised before embracing collocation as equally accurate to galerkin .    in @xcite , @xcite , and other places ,",
    "it is suggested to decrease the global width parameter , making basis functions wider , until the basis is nearly badly conditioned .",
    "however a more refined method for choosing @xmath28 is desirable .",
    "one supporting fact is that the optimal @xmath28 values in table [ tabone ] indeed give large @xmath106 but not quite as large as expected in the literature .",
    "our numerical tests indicate that the collocation orthogonalization error , defined in equation ( [ collortherr ] ) , may guide us in choosing the global width parameter .",
    "we found that minima of the collocation orthogonalization error plotted against the global width parameter occur near minima of eigenfunction / eigenvalue errors calculated by collocation and by the galerkin approach .",
    "for the future , it may be profitable to attempt a further refinement of the choice of nodes / widths in `` hard '' potential regions .",
    "suppose we have nodes / widths constructed by some distribution method , @xmath6 that of @xcite .",
    "methods should be explored for identifying nodes lying in hard potential regions , for adding more nodes to these regions , and for choosing width parameters with respect to potential values in a neighborhood and not just a point .",
    "it seems feasible that these goals can be achieved for high dimensional systems using only simple local calculations .",
    "apart from choosing the centers and relative widths of radial basis functions , a correct scaling of their widths through the global width parameter @xmath28 is critical for good performance .",
    "our suggestion of using the collocation orthogonalization error as a criterion for choosing @xmath28 may be worth pursuing .",
    "one possibility is to avoid full diagonalization of the collocation hamiltonian matrix and to measure the orthogonalization error only for the few lowest , or highest , eigenvectors .",
    "an even simpler method may be tried in the galerkin approach where the `` variational principle '' holds . in this case",
    "the trace of the hamiltonian matrix is minimal for the optimal @xmath28 ( w.r.t .",
    "eigenvalue errors ) .",
    "a very simple method for choosing a `` good '' @xmath28 may possibly be based on this observation .",
    "the work required will not be larger compared to the method used in @xcite based on the condition number of @xmath44 .",
    "some modifications may also be examined .",
    "for example , if the matrix elements of @xmath39 are not calculated exactly we may try to choose @xmath28 by minimizing the first few eigenvalues of @xmath42 .",
    "recall from section [ obssug ] that optimization of functional ( [ funcpl ] ) gives nodes / widths which are consistent with our observations .",
    "so it may be interesting ( but probably difficult ) to apply the ideas of garashchuk and light from @xcite but with the functional ( [ funcpl ] ) , rather than the functional ( [ funcgl ] ) .",
    "that is , to attempt identifying a functional form for the densities and width parameters arising from optimization of functional ( [ funcpl ] ) .",
