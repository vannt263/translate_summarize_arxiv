    "transport in media with quenched or time - dependent disorder has received much interest due to the considerable fundamental and technological importance of the problem @xcite .",
    "transport processes underlay a variety of chromatographic separation techniques @xcite , extraction of oil from porous rocks @xcite , excitations quenching in amorphous solids and doped crystals @xcite , conductivity of complex media and permeability of disordered membranes @xcite .",
    "molecular diffusion measurements in disordered media often serve as a tool in characterizing the internal geometry over a range of molecular and macroscopic length scales @xcite .",
    "in addition , transport processes control the kinetics of chemical reactions in disordered media @xcite .",
    "following motion of individual particles in disordered media one most often encounters behavior characterized by a mean - square displacement @xmath4 growing as @xmath5 i.e. linearly in time with @xmath6 being the `` diffusion '' coefficient , which depends on the peculiar features of the disordered medium .",
    "such type of dynamics is ubiquitous due to its inherent relationship to the central - limit theorem , which makes it a paradigm of stochastic processes .",
    "one the other hand , there was a growing evidence for other laws of random transport , both slower and enhanced relative to the time dependence in eq.([dif ] ) .",
    "generally , one finds @xmath7 case with @xmath8 , known as the dispersive transport or subdiffusive regime , has been in the focus of many theoretical and experimental studies ( see , e.g. , refs.@xcite ) and has been attributed , for instance , to random walks on fractal structures @xcite or to diffusion in presence of temporal traps @xcite .",
    "a few stray examples of such a transport are time of flight measurements in amorphous semiconductors @xcite , defect diffusion in relaxation studies @xcite , excitation migration on the disordered array of donor centers ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) , tracer diffusion in a linear array of convective rolls @xcite or in low - dimensional lattice gases @xcite , or the so - called sinai diffusion with extremely confined particle trajectories such that @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "enhanced diffusion regime , @xmath10 , is observed in turbulent diffusion ( @xmath11 ) , as well as in some other instances ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) for some review ) .",
    "suppose now that in the disordered medium in question , in which , in absence of any fields acting on the species whose motion we follow ( say , tracer particles ) , we find that their mean displacement is zero , while the mean - square displacement @xmath4 obeys eq.([dif ] ) or the anomalous diffusion law in eq.([andif ] ) .",
    "suppose next that we manage to bias somehow the particle motion , say , by charging the tracer particles only and putting the whole system in a constant electric field @xmath12 .",
    "this situation is , of course , quite interesting in its own right and is appropriate to charge transfer or `` dynamic directed percolation '' in time - dependent inhomogeneous medium @xcite , such as , e.g. , certain biomembranes @xcite , solid protonic conductors @xcite , oil - continuous microemulsions @xcite or polymer electrolytes @xcite .",
    "in such a situation , the tracer particles will move preferentially in the direction of the field and will attain a non - zero mean displacement and a non - zero mean velocity @xmath13 .",
    "one may define then the time - dependent tracer particle mobility as @xmath14 while the `` diffusivity '' @xmath15 can be extracted from the behavior in @xmath16 of the field ( eqs.([dif ] ) or ( [ andif ] ) ) via : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the spatial dimension of the system .",
    "now , the question is whether the mobility @xmath19 , calculated from the tracer particle mean displacement in the presence of an external electric field , and the diffusivity @xmath15 , eq.([di ] ) , deduced from the tracer particle mean - square displacement in the absence of the field , obey the generalized einstein relation of the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the reciprocal temperature ?",
    "the answer is trivially positive , of course , for isolated non - interacting particles performing conventional brownian motion . for particle diffusion in disordered medium the validity of the relation in eq.([einstein ] ) is much less evident . on the one hand",
    ", it has been found that eq.([einstein ] ) holds for the tracer particle motion in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) gas of hard spheres , whose whole dynamics consists of pairs of neighboring particles interchanging velocities at each collision and the initial velocity distribution being an equilibrium one @xcite .",
    "it holds also for the tracer particle diffusion in a 1d hard - core gas with diffusional dynamics when the 1d lattice is a ring of a finite length @xcite , as well as for infinite 1d lattices with non - conserved @xcite and conserved particles number @xcite .",
    "remarkably , in the latter case eq.([einstein ] ) holds for @xmath22 sufficiently large despite the fact that both @xmath19 and @xmath15 do not attain constant values as @xmath23 but rather are decreasing functions of time @xcite .",
    "in addition , the validity of the einstein relation has been corroborated for the charge carriers in semiconductors @xcite and for polymeric systems in the subdiffusive regime @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it is well known that the einstein relation is violated in some physical situations ; for instance , it is not fulfilled for sinai diffusion @xcite describing brownian motion of a test particle in presence of a quenched random force , and for the scher - lax - montroll model of anomalous random walk @xcite ( see also refs.@xcite and @xcite for some other examples ) . apparently , the einstein relation is also violated for random walk in disordered lattices at their percolation threshold - the celebrated model of the `` ant in the labyrinth '' of de gennes @xcite . here , in absence of external force acting on the random walker , its mean - square displacement @xmath24 obeys eq.([andif ] ) with @xmath8 @xcite . in presence of external field , which produces a bias in the random walk making the walker more likely to step along the field than against it",
    ", the behavior appears to be rather complex . as a matter of fact",
    ", the bias has a dual effect - it induces drift in the direction of the field , but also creates temporal traps , such as in dead - end branches , to escape from which the walker has to move against the field .",
    "one then finds that the drift velocity is not a monotonic function of the bias @xcite and moreover , it has been argued that the drift velocity vanishes once the bias exceeds a certain threshold value @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "these theoretical arguments have been supported by exact calculation of the mean drift velocity on a random comb and randomly diluted bethe lattice @xcite ( see , however , ref.@xcite for some objections ) .",
    "therefore , a small value of external bias gives rise to a mean displacement in the direction of the field that increases linearly with time , and the mean velocity tends to a constant .",
    "this asymptotic value of the mean velocity is proportional to the field for small fields @xcite , which implies that the mobility tends to a constant as @xmath23 .",
    "contrary to that , since in the absence of the field the walker motion is subdiffusive @xcite , one has that here the diffusivity @xmath15 should vanish as @xmath23 . therefore ,",
    "if the results of refs.@xcite are correct , they would imply that the einstein relation is not valid for diffusion in random lattices at percolation threshold .",
    "hence , in principle , it is not @xmath25 clear at all whether eq.([einstein ] ) should be valid in any case .    in this presentation",
    "we overview some recent results on the generalized einstein relation in eq.([einstein ] ) for tracer particle ( tp ) diffusion in dynamical disordered environments , as exemplified here by non - interacting lattice gases of hard - core particles .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section 2 we introduce the model , basic notations , write down dynamic equations describing the time evolution of the system and discuss the way of their solution . in section 3",
    "we first recall the properties of an unbiased tp diffusion in a 1d hard - core lattice gas .",
    "next , we turn to the case of a biased tp in an inert lattice gas and present explicit results describing the tp mean displacement and the mobility .",
    "we demonstrate then that the einstein relation in eq.([einstein ] ) holds exactly despite the fact that in this case diffusion is anomalous . further on , in section 4 we consider the case",
    "when the initial particle distribution on a 1d lattice is inhomogeneous and characterized by an @xmath26-shape , `` shock''-like density profile .",
    "we find that when the tp is attracted towards the particle phase with higher density , at a certain critical value of the constant attraction force the tp will not move , on average .",
    "assuming the validity of the einstein relation , we find the second moment of the tp displacement .",
    "this heuristic analytical result is confirmed numerically which signifies that the einstein relation holds apparently for such an inhomogeneous situation .",
    "next , in sections 5 and 6 we analyse the forms of the biased tp terminal velocity in one- , two- and three - dimensional hard - core lattice gases undergoing continuous particles exchanges with a reservoir .",
    "we determine the tp mobility and assuming the validity of the einstein relation , obtain the tp diffusion coefficient @xmath6 in the unbiased case .",
    "results for 1d systems are confirmed by numerical monte carlo simulations .",
    "we also show that in two- and three - dimensional systems in the conserved particle density limit ( when particle exchanges with the reservoir are forbidden ) our predictions for @xmath6 coincide with classical results of nakazato and kitahara @xcite , which are known to be in a very good agreement with the numerical data @xcite . in section 7",
    "we present an exact solution for the biased tp mean displacement in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) lattice gas containing a single unoccupied site . on comparing our results with earlier results by brummelhuis and hilhorst @xcite obtained for the unbiased tp dynamics",
    ", we infer that also in this case , in which the tp diffusion is anomalously , logarithmically confined , the einstein relation does hold exactly .",
    "finally , we conclude in section 8 with a brief summary of results and discussion .",
    "consider a @xmath18-dimensional regular hypercubic lattice of spacing @xmath27 each site of which is brought in contact with a reservoir containing identic , electrically neutral particles - a vapor phase ( fig.1 ) , maintained at a constant pressure .",
    "we suppose next that the reservoir particles may be created ( adsorbed ) on any vacant site at a fixed rate @xmath28 , which rate depends on the reservoir pressure and the energy gain due to the `` creation '' event .",
    "further on , the particles may move randomly along the lattice by hopping at a rate @xmath29 to any of @xmath30 neighboring lattice sites , which process is constrained by hard - core exclusion preventing multiple occupancy of any of the sites .",
    "lastly , the particles may spontaneously disappear ( desorb ) from the lattice at rate @xmath31 , which is dependent on the barrier against desorption .",
    "both @xmath32 and @xmath33 are site and environment independent .",
    "_ two - dimensional realization of the model : adsorbed monolayer in contact with a vapor phase .",
    "gray spheres denote the monolayer ( vapor ) particles ; the smaller black sphere stands for the driven tracer particle . _ ]    to describe the occupancy of lattice sites , we introduce a time - dependent variable @xmath34 , which may assume two values : @xmath35 note that the local variable @xmath34 can change its value due to creation of particles ( adsorbtion ) , desorption and random hopping events . note also that random hopping events do conserve the total number of adsorbed particles and hence , the average particle density @xmath36 . on the other hands ,",
    "creation / desorption processes do change @xmath34 locally such that the total number of particles on the lattice is not explicitly conserved when such two processes are allowed .",
    "however , the mean particle density , @xmath37 , approaches as @xmath38 a constant value @xmath39 this relation is well known and represents the customary langmuir adsorption isotherm @xcite .",
    "we finally remark that in the analysis of the stationary - state behavior , we can always turn to the conserved particles number limit by setting @xmath32 and @xmath33 equal to zero and keeping their ratio fixed , i.e. supposing that @xmath40 .",
    "this limit will correspond to the model of biased tracer diffusion in a hard - core lattice gas with fixed particles density @xmath41 , and will allow us to check our analytical predictions against some already known results @xcite .",
    "now , we introduce a bias into the system .",
    "contrary to the well - studied situation in which all particles are subject to a constant force ( see , e.g. , refs.@xcite and references therein ) , we will focus here on essentially less studied case when only one of particles is subject to external bias while the rest have symmetric hopping probabilities .",
    "this particle may be thought of as a probe designated to measure the frictional properties of symmetric non - inteacting lattice gas . to this end , at @xmath42 we introduce at the lattice origin an extra hard - core particle , whose motion we would like to follow and which will be called in what follows as the tracer particle - the tp ; position of this particle at time @xmath22 is denoted as @xmath43 .",
    "we stipulate that the tp is different from other particles in two aspects : a ) it can not disappear from the lattice and b ) it is subject to some external driving force , which favors its jumps into a preferential direction .",
    "physically , ( a ) be realized , for instance , if this only particle is charged and the system is subject to a uniform electric field * e*. we suppose here , for simplicity of exposition , that the external force @xmath44 is oriented according to the unit vector @xmath45 .",
    "the dynamics of the biased tp is defined in the usual fashion @xcite : we suppose that the tp , which occupies the site @xmath43 at time @xmath22 , waits an exponentially distributed time with mean @xmath46 , and then attempts to hop onto one of @xmath30 neighboring sites , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 are @xmath30 unit vectors of the hypercubic lattice . in what follows",
    "we adopt the notation @xmath49 , where @xmath50 will denote the direction of the external force @xmath44 .",
    "next , the jump direction is chosen according to the probablity @xmath51 , which obeys : @xmath52}{\\sum_{\\mu}\\exp\\big[\\frac{\\beta}{2}({\\bf e \\cdot e}_{\\boldsymbol \\mu})\\big ] } , \\label{defp}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the reciprocal temperature , @xmath53 stands for the scalar product , the charge of the tp is set equal to unity and the sum with the subscript @xmath54 denotes summation over all possible orientations of the vector @xmath55 ; that is , @xmath56 .",
    "after the jump direction is chosen , the tp attempts to hop onto the target site .",
    "the hop is instantaneously fulfilled if the target site is vacant at this moment of time ; otherwise , i.e. , if the target site is occupied by any adsorbed particle , the jump is rejected and the tp remains at its position .    to close this subsection ,",
    "several comments on the relevance of the model to some physical situations are in order .",
    "as we have already remarked , in the conserved particles number limit the model under study reduces to the model of biased tracer diffusion in hard - core lattice gases , which is related to a wide variety of physical situations , including , for example , diffusion of interstitials in crystals .",
    "a detailed review can be found in ref.@xcite . in two - dimensions , in the non - conserved particles number case",
    "it describes tracer diffusion in adsorbed monolayers in contact with the vapor phase @xcite and allows to determine , for instance , the analog of the stokes formula for such monolayers and consequently , to elucidate their intrinsic frictional properties . on the other hand",
    ", the 2d case can be thought of as some simplified picture of the stagnant layers emerging in liquids that are in contact with a solid body .",
    "it is well - known ( see , e.g. ref.@xcite ) that liquids in the close vicinity of a solid interface - at distances within a few molecular diameters - do possess completely different physical properties compared to those of the bulk phase . in this stagnant region ,",
    "in which an intrinsically disordered liquid phase is spanned by and interacts with the ordering potential of the solid , the liquid s viscosity is drastically enhanced and transport processes ( related , say , to biased diffusion of charged carriers in solutions ) are substantially hindered . thus our model can be viewed as a two - level approximate model of this challenging physical system , in which the reservoir mimics the bulk fluid phase with very rapid transport , while the adsorbed monolayer ( particles on a 2d lattice ) represents the stagnant layer emerging on the solid - liquid interface .",
    "lastly , the model under study represents a novel example @xcite of the so - called `` dynamic percolation '' models ( see , e.g. , refs.@xcite and references therein ) , invoked to describe transport processes in many situations with dynamical disorder . in this context , the lattice gas particles can be thought of as representing some fluctuating environment , which hinders the motion of an impure molecule - the tp , which might be , for example , a charge carrier .",
    "a salient feature of this model , which makes it different from the previously proposed models of dynamic percolative environments , is that we include the hard - core interactions between the `` environment '' particles and the tp , such that the latter may itself influence the dynamics of the environment .",
    "as we proceed to show , this circumstance turns out to be very important and will result in formation of inhomogeneous distribution of the environment particles .",
    "now , we derive the evolution equations in a general , @xmath18-dimensional case .",
    "we begin by introducing some auxiliary definitions .",
    "let @xmath57 denote the entire set of the occupation variables , which defines the instantaneous configuration of the lattice - gas particles at time moment @xmath22 .",
    "next , let @xmath58 stand for the joint probability of finding at time @xmath22 the tp at the site @xmath59 and all adsorbed particles in the configuration @xmath60 . then , denoting as @xmath61 a configuration obtained from @xmath60 by the kawasaki - type exchange of the occupation variables of two neighboring sites @xmath62 and @xmath63 , and as @xmath64 - a configuration obtained from the original @xmath60 by the replacement @xmath65 , which corresponds to the glauber - type flip of the occupation variable due to the creation / desorption events , we have that the time evolution of the configuration probability @xmath58 obeys the following master equation : @xmath66    the mean velocity @xmath13 of the tp can be obtained by multiplying both sides of eq.([eqmaitresse ] ) by @xmath67 and summing over all possible configurations @xmath68 .",
    "this results in the following exact equation determining the tp velocity : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the probability of having at time t a lattice gas particle at position @xmath71 , defined in the frame of reference moving with the tp .",
    "in other words , @xmath72 can be thought of as being the particle density profile as seen from the moving tp .",
    "equation ( [ vitesse ] ) signifies that the velocity of the tp is dependent on the lattice gas particles density in the immediate vicinity of the tracer .",
    "if the lattice gas is perfectly stirred , or , in other words , if @xmath73 everywhere , ( which implies immediate decoupling of @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) , one would obtain from eq.([vitesse ] ) a trivial mean - field result @xmath74 which states that the only effect of the medium on the tp dynamics is that its jump time @xmath46 is merely renormalized by a factor @xmath75 ; @xmath76 defines simply the mean frequency of successful jump events .",
    "however , the situation appears to be more complicated and , as we proceed to show , @xmath72 is different from the equilibrium value @xmath41 everywhere , except for @xmath77 .",
    "this means that the tp strongly perturbs the particles distribution on the lattice - it is no longer uniform and some non - trivial density profiles emerge .",
    "now , in order to calculate the instantaneous mean velocity of the tp we have to determine the mean particles density at the neighboring to the tp sites @xmath78 , which requires , in turn , computation of the density profile @xmath72 for arbitrary @xmath79 .",
    "the latter can be found from the master equation ( [ eqmaitresse ] ) by multiplying both sides by @xmath80 and performing the summation over all configurations @xmath68 . in doing so",
    ", we find that these equations are not closed with respect to @xmath72 , but are coupled to the third - order correlations , @xmath81 in turn , if we proceed further to the third - order correlations , we find that these are coupled respectively to the fourth - order correlations . consequently , in order to compute @xmath13 , one faces the problem of solving an infinite hierarchy of coupled equations .",
    "we resort then to the simplest non - trivial closure of the hierarchy in terms of @xmath72 , which has been first proposed in ref.@xcite , and represent @xmath82 as @xmath83 some arguments justifying such an approximation can be found in ref.@xcite .    using the approximation in eq.([decouplage ] ) , we obtain @xmath84 which holds for all @xmath71 , except for @xmath85 .",
    "one the other hand , for these special sites @xmath86 with @xmath87 we find @xmath88 where the coefficients @xmath89 are defined by @xmath90 note that eq.([systemek2 ] ) represents , from the mathematical point of view , the boundary conditions for the general evolution equation ( [ systemek1 ] ) , imposed on the sites in the immediate vicinity of the tp . equations",
    "( [ systemek1 ] ) and ( [ systemek2 ] ) together with eq.([vitesse ] ) thus constitute a closed system of equations which suffice computation of all properties of interest , i.e. the time - dependent tracer particle velocity and the particle density profiles as seen from the tracer particle .",
    "the general approach to solution of coupled non - linear eqs.([vitesse]),([systemek1 ] ) and ( [ systemek2 ] ) has been discussed in detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "here we merely note that despite the fact that using the decoupling scheme in eq.([decouplage ] ) we effectively close the system of equations on the level of the pair correlations , solution of eqs.([systemek1 ] ) and ( [ systemek2 ] ) still poses serious technical difficulties : namely , these equations are non - linear with respect to the tp velocity , which enters the gradient term on the rhs of the evolution equations for the pair correlation , and does depend itself on the values of the monolayer particles densities in the immediate vicinity of the tp .",
    "solution of this system of non - linear equations for several particular case will be presented in the next sections .",
    "consider first biased tracer diffusion in the simplest case of a 1d hard - core lattice gas with conserved particles number ; that is , a lattice gas in which all particles were initially introduced onto the lattice and particle exchanges with the vapor phase are forbidden ( @xmath91 .",
    "hence , the particle density @xmath41 on the lattice is kept constant all the time . for simplicity",
    ", we also set here the spacing @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "these parameters can be trivially restored in final results .    in absence of external field acting on the tp , when its transition probabilities are symmetric , tracer dynamics has been studied first in refs.@xcite and the tp mean - square displacement @xmath94 has been determined exactly : @xmath95 which thus follows an anomalous diffusion law in eq.([andif ] ) with @xmath96 .",
    "consequently , the `` diffusivity '' d(t ) is given here by @xmath97    now , if we charge the tp and switch on an external electric field , how will the tp velocity and the mobility behave ?",
    "an early incomplete answer was presented in ref.@xcite which focused on the extreme case of an infinitely strong electric field @xmath98 such that the tp performs a totally directed random walk constrained by hard - core particles . by noticing that such a model is tantamount to the 1d stefan freezing problem or the problem of directional solidification @xcite , ( the role of the latent heat being played by the lattice gas particles ) , it was found that in this extreme case the tp mean velocity follows @xmath99 where @xmath100 is a function of @xmath41 defined implicitly by @xmath101 @xmath102 being the complementary error function .",
    "hence , the tp mean velocity in the biased case decays at exactly the same rate as the tp `` diffusivity '' in the unbiased case ! in view of such a coincidence , one is , of course , prompted to consider the general case @xmath103 and to check the prefactors in eq.([speed ] ) having in mind to verify the validity of eq.([einstein ] ) for anomalous tracer diffusion in such random dynamical environments @xcite .",
    "the general case of arbitrary @xmath104 has been studied in ref.@xcite within the framework of the approach outlined in section 2 and subsequently , in terms of a rigorous probabilistic approach in ref.@xcite .",
    "results of these two approaches coincide , which justifies the decoupling approximation in eq.([decouplage ] ) .",
    "it has been found that in this general case the tp mean velocity @xmath105 obeys at sufficiently large times the form of eq.([speed ] ) , i.e. @xmath106 , in which law the prefactor @xmath107 is determined by the following equation @xcite : @xmath108 where @xmath109\\ ] ] in the limit @xmath110 the solution of the transcedental eq.([k ] ) has the form @xmath111 which implies that the time - dependent mobility in this case is given by @xmath112 finally , by comparing the prefactors in the latter equation and eq.([harris ] ) , we find that the generalized einstein relation in eq.([einstein ] ) holds exactly for such an anomalous diffusion !",
    "to close this section , we make several comments on the particle density distribution as seen from the tracer particle .",
    "since the tp has a non - zero mean displacement , while the lattice gas particles have symmetric hopping probabilities and hence , a zero mean displacement , they tend to accumulate in front of the tp .",
    "consequently , a condensed , traffic jam - like region is formed in front of the tp , and a depleted by the lattice - gas particles region past the tp emerges . as a matter of fact",
    ", such a inhomogeneous density distribution is not stationary : the size of the traffic jam - like region , in which the particle density profile @xmath113 is nearly constant and larger than @xmath41 , @xmath114 , grows in proportion to the tp mean displacement .",
    "the size of the depleted region with a constant density @xmath115 also grows in proportion to @xmath116 .",
    "in this section we address the question of the validity of the generalized einstein relation in a somewhat exotic situation in which the initial particle distributions from both sides of the tp has an @xmath26-shape , shock - like profile characterized by two different mean densities @xcite .",
    "that is , as depicted in fig.2 , we suppose that the tp is initially at the origin , and the particles mean densities from the left and from the right of the origin , which we denote as @xmath117 and @xmath118 , respectively , are not equal to each other .",
    "the tp thus defines position of the `` shock front '' . without of lack of generality ,",
    "we suppose that @xmath119 , and will call in what follows the particle phase which initially occupied the left half - line as the high - density phase ( hdp ) , while the phase initially occupying the right half - line will be referred to as the low - density phase ( ldp ) .     _",
    "initial `` shock''configuration of the lattice gas particles on a 1d lattice .",
    "@xmath117 is the initial mean density of particles at the half - line @xmath120 and @xmath118 is the mean density of particles at the half - line @xmath121 .",
    "all lattice gas particles , excluding the tp ( the `` shock '' front particle ) , have symmetric transition probabilities .",
    "the tp has asymmetric transition probabilities and experiences the bias in the negative direction . _ ]    further on , after deposition on the lattice , particles start to perform @xmath122 , ( i.e. with equal probabilities for going to the left or to the right ) , hopping motion between the nearest lattice sites under the constraint that neither two particles can simultaneously occupy the same lattice site and can not pass through each other .",
    "next , we stipulate that the tp is subject to a constant force @xmath123 which favors its jumps in a preferential direction .",
    "thus for the tp the probabilities of going to the right ( @xmath124 ) and to the left ( @xmath125 ) will be different from each other .",
    "we will suppose that @xmath123 is directed towards the hdp .",
    "we adopt the convention that in this case @xmath123 is negative , @xmath126 ; the tp hopping probabilities @xmath124 and @xmath125 are related to the force and the reciprocal temperature @xmath21 through @xmath127 and @xmath128 . from the physical point of view , such a @xmath129 force can be understood as an effective boundary tension derived from the solid - on - solid - model hamiltonian of the phase - separating boundary @xcite and mimic , in a mean - field fashion , the presence of attractive interactions between the lattice - gas particles which are not explicitly included in the model .",
    "relation between @xmath124 , @xmath125 and the amplitude of attractive interparticle interactions has been discussed in refs.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the tp dynamics in such a system has been analysed in refs.@xcite and @xcite and it has been found that the tp mean velocity obeys @xmath130 at sufficiently large times , where the prefactor @xmath131 is determined implicitly as the solution of the following equation : @xmath132 which generalizes the result of the previous section for the case of @xmath133 .",
    "equation ( [ j ] ) predicts that three different regimes can take place depending on the relation between @xmath134 and @xmath135 :    \\(1 ) when @xmath136 the parameter @xmath131 is finite and positive , which means that the hdp expands compressing the ldp . in the particular case @xmath137 and @xmath138",
    "the parameter @xmath131 appears to be a positive , logarithmically growing with time function , which behavior agrees with the results of ref.@xcite .",
    "\\(2 ) when @xmath139 the parameter @xmath131 is less than zero - the expanding ldp and the applied force effectively compress the hdp .",
    "\\(3 ) when @xmath140 , the parameter @xmath141 .",
    "this relation between the system parameters when the hdp and the ldp are in equilibrium with each other and the tp mean displacement is zero , was found also in ref.@xcite from the analysis of the stationary behavior in a finite 1d lattice gas .",
    "`` shock front '' , or , in other words , the tp propagation in cases ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) has been discussed in detail in ref.@xcite . here ,",
    "in view of our interest in the einstein relation , we will focus on the case ( 3 ) in which situation the high- and low - density phases coexist such that the tp mean displacement is equal to zero . on the other hand ,",
    "it is clear that also in this case the tp will wander randomly around the equilibrium position and one may expect that its mean - square displacement will not be equal to zero .    to determine the tp mean - square displacement @xmath142",

    "to conclude , in this presentation we have overviewed some recent results on biased tracer diffusion in disordered dynamical environments represented by hard - core lattice gases .",
    "we have considered several possible situations including 1d lattice gases with conserved and non - conserved particles density with initial homogeneous or `` shock''-like particle distributions , @xmath18-dimensional lattice gases undergoing continuous exchanges with a reservoir , as well as an extreme case of biased tracer diffusion in a 2d highly - packed lattice gas containing only a single vacancy .",
    "the main emphasis of our analysis here has been put on the question whether the einstein relation between the tracer particle mobility and the diffusivity is valid , despite the fact that in some cases the tracer diffusion is anomalously confined or , in case of regular diffusion , the mobility and the diffusivity are non - trivial functions of the lattice gas density and other pertinent parameters .",
    "for some situations we were able to furnish exact solutions , which show explicitly that this fundamental relation holds . in other instances , to calculate the tracer particle mobility we invoked an approximate approach based on decoupling of the third - order correlation functions .",
    "the tracer particle diffusivity has been then obtained by assuming that the einstein relations holds .",
    "extensive numerical simulations have been performed , which confirm our analytical predictions and thus the validity of the einstein relation .",
    "apart of it , we have shown that the lattice gas particles distribution as seen from moving tp is strongly inhomogeneous : the local particle density in front of the tp is higher than the average , which means that the lattice gas particles tend to accumulate in front of the driven tp , creating a sort of a `` traffic jam '' , which impedes its motion .",
    "the condensed , `` traffic jam''-like region in the case when the particles density is not explicitly conserved is characterized by a @xmath329 density profile which vanishes as an exponential function of the distance from the tracer .",
    "the characteristic length and the amplitude of the density relaxation function have been calculated explicitly .",
    "in one dimensional situations with conserved particles density the `` traffic jam '' region grows in size in proportion to the tp mean displacement and no @xmath329 profile exists . on the other hand , past the tp the local density is lower than the average . in one dimensional situations with conserved particle density",
    "this depleted by particles region also grows in size in proportion to the tp mean displacement . in higher dimensions ,",
    "we have observed that depending on whether the number of particles is explicitly conserved or not , the local density past the tp may tend to the average value at large separations from the tp in a completely different fashion : in the non - conserved case the decay of the density is described by an exponential function , while for the conserved particles number case it shows an @xmath330 dependence on the distance , revealing in the latter case especially strong memory effects and strong correlations between the particle distribution in the lattice gas and the tracer position .",
    "further on , we have found that the terminal velocity @xmath159 of the tp depends explicitly on both the excess density in the `` jammed '' region in front of the tp , as well as on the density in the depleted region past the tracer .",
    "we realized that both densities are themselves dependent on the magnitude of the tracer velocity , applied external force , as well as on the rate of the adsorption / desorption processes and on the rate at which the particles can diffuse away of the tracer , which results in effective non - linear coupling between @xmath159 and @xmath12 . in consequence , in the general case ( for arbitrary adsorption / desorption rates and arbitrary external force ) , @xmath159 can be found only implicitly , as the solution of a transcendental equation relating @xmath159 to the system parameters .",
    "this equation simplifies considerably in the limit of a vanishingly small external bias ; in this case we recover a linear force - velocity relation , akin to the so - called stokes formula .",
    "this linear relation signifies that the frictional force exerted on the tracer particle by the host medium ( the lattice gas ) is viscous .",
    "the tp mobility , which is inverse of the stokes friction coefficient , thus results from an intricate cooperative behavior .",

    "<S> we consider both models in which the gas particles density is explicitly conserved and situations in which the lattice gas particles undergo continuous exchanges with a reservoir , which case is appropriate , e.g. , to adsorbed monolayers in contact with the vapor phase . for all these models we determine , in some cases exactly and in other ones - using a certain decoupling approximation , the mean displacement of a tracer particle ( tp ) driven by a constant external force in a dynamical background formed by the lattice gas particles </S>",

    "<S> explicitly we are able to define the tp mobility , which allows us to demonstrate that the einstein relation between the tp mobility and the diffusivity generally holds , despite the fact that in some cases diffusion is anomalous . for models treated within the framework of the decoupling approximation , </S>",
