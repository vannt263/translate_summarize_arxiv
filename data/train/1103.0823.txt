    "after the completion of the spring-8/leps facility in 2000 , a linearly polarized photon beam at @xmath1=1.5 - 2.4 gev has been used for studying hadron photoproduction reactions . introducing a polarized target",
    "is believed to play a crucial role in understanding the hadron structures  @xcite and reaction mechanisms  @xcite , and would result in upgrades of the leps experiments . for this purpose ,",
    "we have developed a polarized hydrogen - deuteride ( hd )  @xcite target for future experiments at spring-8/leps .",
    "after the important work on the relaxation mechanism for polarized protons in solid hd  @xcite , honig first suggested that the hd molecule can be used as a frozen spin polarized target  @xcite .",
    "thanks to longstanding efforts at syracuse  @xcite , bnl  @xcite , and orsay  @xcite , the hd target has been firstly used for the actual experiment at legs  @xcite , and will be used both at jlab  @xcite and at spring-8  @xcite in near future . in order to achieve high polarizations of proton and deuteron in the hd target , we employ the static method ( `` brute force '' method ) at low temperature ( 10 mk ) and at high magnetic field ( 17 t ) .",
    "the expected polarization of proton is 94% at maximum . in order to polarize protons in the frozen hd target ,",
    "honig  @xcite applied the innovative idea that the hd polarization gradually grows up in the spin - flip process between hd molecules and a small amount of ortho - h@xmath2 with spin 1 by making use of the mechanism originally clarified in earlier years by motizuki _",
    "_  @xcite . after a long period of cooling",
    ", ortho - h@xmath2 molecules are converted to para - h@xmath2 .",
    "since the para - h@xmath2 has a total spin 0 , the spin - flip process will be ended when all the ortho - h@xmath2 molecules are converted to the para - h@xmath2 .",
    "if ortho - h@xmath2 does not remain in the hd sample , the relaxation time of hydrogen polarization becomes very long even at a temperature higher than 1 k after an aging process for 2 - 3 months .",
    "a polarized hd target is produced at rcnp , and then it is transported to the leps facility at spring-8 which locates at a distance of about 130 km from rcnp .",
    "the hd polarization should be monitored by using the same nmr polarimeter system at rcnp and at spring-8 .",
    "the polarization must be determined with a precision of 10% for distinguishing the theoretical model calculations  @xcite . for this purpose ,",
    "a portable nmr system is desired .    in the 1960 s , nmr measurements for the development of polarized targets",
    "were carried out by using a diode demodulator and a tuned rf amplifier .",
    "poor @xmath0 ratio and linearity of these devices restricted the precision of the measurements . at the end of the 1960 s ,",
    "the performance and reliability of the nmr measurements greatly improved due to the development of the synchronous demodulation technique , called the phase - sensitive demodulator ( psd ) . a lock - in amplifier was developed by combining the psd with the tuned rf amplifier and widely used for the nmr measurements .",
    "although the devices for the nmr measurements become downsized , they are still heavy and large for a long - distance transportation .",
    "we newly developed a portable nmr system by employing cutting - edge digital technologies for the fast adc and for software logic circuits with a usual laptop computer .",
    "this paper describes the basic concept and the performance of the portable nmr system .",
    "[ fig : sc_coil.eps](a ) schematically shows the storage cryostat ( sc ) which is used for solidifying hd and for keeping the polarization of the hd target during the transportation from rcnp to spring-8 .",
    "the sc mainly consists of a liquid nitrogen ( ln@xmath3 ) bath , a liquid helium ( lhe ) bath , and a superconducting magnet .",
    "the sc is equipped with a needle valve to control the hd temperature in the range of 1.5 - 30 k by pumping evaporated he gas from the lhe bath . the superconducting magnet cooled by lhe provides the maximum magnetic field of 2.5 t. the homogeneity , @xmath4b / b , of the magnetic field is @xmath5 in the central region over 300 mm long and 30 mm diameter .",
    "the hd gas is solidified in a cell made of kel - f@xmath6 ( pctfe : poly - chloro - tri - fluoro - ethylene ) , a hydrogen - free material .    the set - up of the coil support frame around the target cell in the sc",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sc_coil.eps](b ) .",
    "we apply a single coil method for nmr measurements  @xcite . a teflon coated silver wire with a diameter of 0.1 mm is wounded as a saddle coil by 1 turn on the coil support frame which is also made of kel - f@xmath6 .     of the superconducting magnet and the applied rf field @xmath7 . , width=302 ]    the polarization of a nucleus with a spin of 1/2 is defined as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the numbers of sub - states @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the absorption strength of the rf power in the nmr coil is proportional to magnetization which is also proportional to the polarization  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the proportionality between the polarization and the absorption strength can be used for determining the polarization degree .",
    "the details about the nmr absorption functions are given by abragam  @xcite .",
    "the susceptibility @xmath13 is defined by the two functional forms as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the longitudinal relaxation time , @xmath16 is the transverse relaxation time , @xmath17 is a gyro - magnetic ratio , @xmath18 is resonance frequency , @xmath19 is sweep frequency , @xmath20 is defined as @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the rotating field amplitude .",
    "two responses shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : in_quad.eps ] correspond to the dispersion and absorption functions obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : chi ] ) and ( [ eqn : chi  ] ) which are derived from the bloch equation  @xcite .    ) .",
    "( b ) the strength of in - phase signal proportional to the polarization degree which corresponds to the absorption function given in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : chi ] ) .",
    "these nmr signals are simulated under the condition that the frequency is fixed at 29.26 mhz , the magnetic field is swept from 0.67 to 0.75 tesla , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are assumed to be 1 second.,width=302 ]    the polarization of the target is proportional to the strength of the absorption function @xmath23 .",
    "thus polarization p can be expressed as follows  @xcite . @xmath24",
    "the conventional nmr polarimeter system consists of a signal generator , an oscilloscope , a lock - in amplifier and a network analyzer .",
    "the network analyzer is used for minimizing power reflection of the nmr circuit by tuning variable capacitors at off - resonance frequencies .",
    "the oscilloscope is used to observe the signals returned from the nmr coil .",
    "the lock - in amplifier is used to pick up small rf signals with a frequency equal to the frequency of the input signal .",
    "even if a noise level is several thousand times higher than a true tiny nmr signal , a signal with a specific frequency can be extracted by using a phase sensitive detection method .",
    "noises with frequencies other than the reference frequency are rejected . as a result",
    ", we can greatly reduce the effect of noises in the nmr measurement . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nmr_diagram.eps ] , we introduced a special circuit to cancel output signals in the case of the non - resonance . the sinusoidal wave output from the signal generator",
    "is divided into two components .",
    "one is sent to the nmr coil and the other is sent to the lock - in amplifier as a reference signal . when the nuclear magnetic resonance occurs , the hd target absorbs rf energies from the coil , and the absorption signal is measured with the lock - in amplifier when magnetic field ( or frequency ) is swept .",
    "essentially , these devices are able to be constructed from two functions to generate rf signals and to digitize the signals .",
    "if these two functions are integrated into one device , it is expected that the polarimeter system is downsized and its cost is greatly reduced .",
    "we have constructed the portable nmr polarimeter by using `` pci extensions for instrumentation ( pxi ) ''  @xcite .",
    "this system consists of pxi-1036 ( chassis ) , pxi-8360 ( connection between pc and pxi ) , pxi-5404 ( signal generator ) , and pxi-5142 ( adc ) which are produced by national instruments company .",
    "the hardwares used in the present work are listed in table  [ tab : hardwares ] .",
    "the aforementioned functions necessary for nmr measurements are virtually implemented and are realized using the labview software .",
    "the schematic drawing of the portable nmr polarimeter system is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : nmr_pxi_diagram.eps ] .",
    ".hardware of the portable nmr polarimeter system [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we checked the stability of the h peak measured with the portable system periodically in a day .",
    "the fluctuation of the peak strength was found to be smaller than 5% .",
    "this stability satisfies the requirement that the hydrogen polarization degree is determined within a precision of 10% .",
    "a portable nmr polarimeter system was developed for measuring the polarization degree of the polarized hd target at rcnp and spring-8 .",
    "downsizing of the nmr system was successfully achieved by building the signal generator , oscilloscope , lock - in amplifier and network analyzer in the software ( labview ) with pxi .",
    "the performance of the portable nmr system was proved to be compatible with the conventional nmr system .",
    "the @xmath0 ratio of the portable nmr polarimeter system depends on the mathematical operation speed . if the number of samplings for averaging increases , statistical errors decrease . in the present development",
    ", we used a usual laptop pc ( cpu : core 2 duo t7700 , 2.4 ghz ) for the portable nmr system .",
    "thus , it is expected that the @xmath0 ratio will be improved furthermore if we use pxi - express devices with higher speed of data transportation and a higher performance pc .",
    "the present work was supported in part by the ministry of education , science , sports and culture of japan and by the national science council of republic of china ( taiwan ) .",
    "this work was also supported by program for enhancing systematic education in graduate schools and osaka university .",
