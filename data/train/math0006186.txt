    "this article is an account of some basic local geometric properties of the hermitian symmetric spaces and how these properties can be used to derive interesting topological and algebro - geometric consequences .",
    "the study that lead to this article was inspired by a simple problem : to understand , from a geometric point of view , why a certain subvariety in  @xmath16 , the grassmannian of @xmath17-planes in  @xmath18 , can not be smoothed , . ]",
    "i.e. , is not homologous to a smooth subvariety of  @xmath16 .",
    "the subvariety in question can be described as follows ( where i will generalize the setting for the sake of exposition ) : the grassmannian  @xmath19 of @xmath20-dimensional subspaces of  @xmath21 is a smooth compact algebraic variety of dimension  @xmath22 that is naturally embedded into the projective space  @xmath23 . for any  @xmath24 and any subspace  @xmath25 of codimension  @xmath26",
    ", the subvariety @xmath27 has codimension  @xmath28 in  @xmath19 .",
    "( the subvariety  @xmath29 is one of an important family of subvarieties of the grassmannians known as _ schubert cycles _ ( see   [ ssec : schubert - cycles ] ) whose associated homology classes form a natural basis for the integral homology of  @xmath19 . in particular ,",
    "@xmath29 is denoted  @xmath30 in the standard notation for schubert cycles . )",
    "when  @xmath31 and  @xmath32 , the variety  @xmath29 is singular .",
    "for example , when  @xmath33 , the singular locus of  @xmath29 is @xmath34 , i.e. , the set of @xmath35-planes that lie completely in  @xmath36 .",
    "now , in some cases , @xmath29 , though singular , is homologous to a smooth subvariety of  @xmath19 .",
    "for example , when  @xmath37 the hypersurface  @xmath38 is a hyperplane section  @xmath39 where  @xmath40 is the hyperplane of  @xmath20-vectors that are annihilated by the decomposable @xmath20-form  @xmath41 ( unique up to multiples ) that has  @xmath25 as its kernel . meanwhile , for the generic hyperplane  @xmath42 , the intersection  @xmath43 is a smooth hypersurface in  @xmath19 that is homologous to  @xmath29 .",
    "however , when  @xmath44 , hartshorne , rees , and thomas  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2 ) show that @xmath45 is not homologous to a smooth subvariety .",
    "they do this by using results of thom  @xcite to prove the stronger result that the integral homology class of  @xmath16 that  @xmath29 represents is not representable as an integral linear combination of homology classes of smooth , oriented submanifolds of  @xmath16 of ( real ) codimension  @xmath46 .",
    "a slightly different situation presents itself for the case @xmath44 in  @xmath47 . in this case , @xmath29 itself is singular , but its homology class can be written as the difference of the homology classes of two nonsingular subvarieties .",
    "however , this use of differences is essential , because it turns out that  @xmath29 is not homologous to any nonsingular subvariety .",
    "in fact , when  @xmath44 and  @xmath48 , it turns out ( see theorem  [ thm : codim2-sigma2 ] ) that any codimension  @xmath35 subvariety of  @xmath19 that is homologous to  @xmath29 must actually be equal to  @xmath49 for some subspace  @xmath50 of codimension  @xmath51 ( and hence must be singular ) .",
    "moreover , it turns out that no integral multiple of the homology class of @xmath29 can be represented by a smooth subvariety of  @xmath19 ( see the discussion in example  [ ex : sigma2-must - be - singular ] ) .",
    "this is in spite of the fact that results of thom  @xcite show that there is an integral multiple of the homology class of  @xmath29 that can be represented by a smooth submanifold of  @xmath19 , even one with a complex normal bundle . of course",
    ", such a submanifold can not be holomorphic .",
    "my goal in this article is to explain these sorts of nonsmoothability and rigidity results from a more geometric perspective , using techniques from differential and algebraic geometry , along the lines of griffiths and harris  @xcite rather than the topological techniques of thom .",
    "i now want to explain why one might expect to be able to approach this problem by local , differential - geometric techniques .    recall that complex vector spaces are canonically oriented , so that it makes sense to say whether a top - degree differential form is positive or not .",
    "more generally , one says that a ( real - valued ) @xmath52-form on a complex manifold  @xmath0 is _ weakly positive _ if it is non - negative on every complex @xmath2-plane  @xmath53 .",
    "the standard example of such a form is the @xmath2-th power of a khler form ( which is actually positive on each tangent complex @xmath2-plane ) .",
    "it is an interesting feature of the grassmannians  @xmath19 ( which , as will be seen , generalizes to other hermitian symmetric spaces and schubert varieties ) that there exists a closed , weakly positive @xmath54-form  @xmath55 on  @xmath19 that is non - zero in cohomology and yet vanishes identically when pulled back to the smooth locus of  @xmath29 where  @xmath25 is a subspace of codimension  @xmath51 .",
    "it follows that  @xmath55 must vanish identically when pulled back to the smooth locus of any codimension  @xmath35 subvariety  @xmath56 that is homologous to  @xmath36 .    the conditions on a complex @xmath57-plane  @xmath58 that  @xmath55 vanish identically on  @xmath59 turn out to be very restrictive .",
    "an analysis of these conditions shows that any codimension  @xmath35 complex submanifold  @xmath56 to which @xmath55 pulls back to be zero must satisfy an overdetermined system of holomorphic first order partial differential equations .",
    "fortunately , this system of equations is fairly simple , and one can describe its local solutions explicitly in terms of local subvarieties of  @xmath60 : one finds that there exists a rational map  @xmath61 whose differential generically has rank  @xmath62 with the property that , for all  @xmath63 , the point  @xmath64 lies in  @xmath65 .",
    "thus , letting  @xmath66 be the closure of the image of  @xmath67 , one finds that  @xmath68 is a subset of the variety of  @xmath20-planes whose projectivizations meet  @xmath69 . for dimension reasons",
    ", @xmath68 must be open in this variety .",
    "( see theorem  [ thm : codim2-sigma2 ] for details ) .",
    "thus , when  @xmath70 , for any codimension  @xmath35 algebraic variety  @xmath56 that satisfies the equation in integral homology  @xmath71 = r\\,\\bigl[\\sigma(w)\\bigr]$ ] , there exists a codimension  @xmath51 subvariety  @xmath66 of degree  @xmath72 so that @xmath73 from this description , and  @xmath74 , this is a classical result  @xcite .",
    "( i thank igor dolgachev for supplying me with this reference ) . in a private communication",
    "( 24 july 2000 ) , chad schoen has supplied a proof of a version of this result when  @xmath33 that is valid over any algebraically closed field . ]",
    "it is easy to see that  @xmath68 is singular unless  @xmath69 is a single point . in particular",
    ", @xmath68 is singular if  @xmath75 or if  @xmath76 and  @xmath77 .",
    "thus , this line of argument realizes the original goal of finding a geometric explanation for the fact that many of the varieties  @xmath29 are not homologous to smooth subvarieties .",
    "it also provides sharper results , since it shows that  @xmath29 can not even be deformed in any non - trivial way : any codimension  @xmath35 subvariety  @xmath56 that is homologous to  @xmath29 is of the form  @xmath78 for some subspace  @xmath50 of codimension  @xmath51 .",
    "for this reason , the cycle  @xmath29 will be said to be  _",
    "rigid_. even when @xmath71=r\\,\\bigl[\\sigma(w)\\bigr]$ ] for some  @xmath77 , the variety  @xmath68 displays a form of rigidity : it is a union of an @xmath79-parameter family of  @xmath80s linearly embedded into  @xmath19 .",
    "roughly speaking , it can only ` deform ' in @xmath62 of its  @xmath81 dimensions .",
    "i refer to this ( rather loosely defined ) property as _ quasi - rigidity_.      while the considerations above may seem very special , they actually generalize to cover an enormous number of cases .",
    "let  @xmath82 be an irreducible hermitian symmetric space of compact type , where  @xmath83 is compact , connected simple lie group and  @xmath84 is a symmetric subgroup with a central subgroup of dimension  @xmath85 .    by results of kostant",
    "@xcite , there is an essentially canonical basis  @xmath86 for the integral homology  @xmath87 ( which is all of even degree and torsion free ) that generalizes the well - known schubert basis of the grassmannians  @xmath19 ( see   [ sec : grass ] ) .",
    "each of the elements of the basis  @xmath86 is representable by a ( generalized ) schubert variety in  @xmath0 and , furthermore , the integral homology class of any compact subvariety of  @xmath0 is an integral combination of elements of  @xmath86 with non - negative coefficients .    for each such schubert variety",
    "@xmath88 , there is a unique @xmath83-invariant harmonic form  @xmath89 of type  @xmath90 where  @xmath91 that represents intersection with  @xmath92 , in the sense that @xmath93\\cap[x]\\in{{\\mathbb z}}\\ ] ] when  @xmath94 is any subvariety of ( complex ) dimension  @xmath2 and the right hand side is interpreted as the homological intersection pairing . as kostant shows ,",
    "the form  @xmath89 is weakly positive .. ] in particular , @xmath89 must vanish identically on any  @xmath68 that satisfies the homological condition  @xmath95\\cap[x]=0 $ ] .",
    "it turns out ( and , in any case , follows easily from kostant s results ) that any complex submanifold of  @xmath0 on which  @xmath89 vanishes must satisfy a first order system of holomorphic partial differential equations .",
    "this system depends only on the cohomology class  @xmath95 $ ] and turns out to be invariant under  @xmath96 , the identity component of the group of biholomorphisms of  @xmath0 ( which contains  @xmath83 as a maximal compact subgroup ) .",
    "thus , one may expect to get global information about the complex subvarieties  @xmath68 that satisfy  @xmath71\\cap[\\sigma]=0 $ ] by studying the studying the local solutions of this system of partial differential equations .",
    "this expectation is amply borne out by the results in this article .    the cases in which  @xmath92 has low dimension or codimension turn out to be particularly accessible , and a complete description of the subvarieties  @xmath68 satisfying  @xmath71\\cap[\\sigma]=0 $ ] is available .",
    "it often takes the form of saying that such subvarieties are rigid or quasi - rigid in a sense analogous to that of the examples discussed above in the grassmannian case .",
    "these descriptions of rigid and quasi - rigid varieties in the grassmannians will be applied to the characterization of holomorphic bundles over compact complex manifolds that are generated by their sections and yet satisfy certain vanishing conditions on polynomials in their chern classes .",
    "of course , the idea of using ( weak ) positivity of a @xmath90 form representing a cohomology class on a complex manifold  @xmath0 to derive information about the subvarieties on which it vanishes is not new .",
    "in fact , this already appears in the work of kostant cited above .",
    "another place where this technique has been used to great effect is in griffiths and harris  @xcite , where they combine these ideas with information coming from the geometry of gauss maps to study the subvarieties of abelian varieties that have degenerate gauss maps .",
    "after the first version of this article was posted to the arxiv , dan burns brought to my attention the ( unpublished ) 1997 thesis of maria walters  @xcite , in which she also investigated the consequences of positivity of certain of the forms on the grassmannians to prove rigidity results .",
    "some of her results anticipate mine .",
    "i will discuss the relation between her results and the results of the present article as the opportunity arises .    in concluding this overview ,",
    "i would like to thank several people for their very helpful comments and suggestions on the first version of this article or for references to the algebraic geometry literature : dan burns , igor dolgachev , phillip griffiths , robin hartshorne , chad schoen , and maria walters .",
    "any errors or infelicities that remain are solely due to me .      in this section ,",
    "i introduce some of the concepts that will be important in this article .",
    "the reader will probably be relieved to know that , in the cases studied in this article , no essential use is made of the theory of exterior differential systems as such .",
    "for example , there is no use of the concepts of polar spaces , regularity , involutivity , characteristic variety , and so on .",
    "the cartan - khler theorem will not even be mentioned outside this sentence .",
    "in fact , the reader only needs to know the following exterior differential systems terminology to read this article :    [ def : diff ideal ] a _ differential ideal _",
    "@xmath3 on  @xmath0 is a sheaf of ideals of holomorphic differential forms on  @xmath0 that is closed under exterior derivative .",
    "an _ integral element _ of  @xmath3 is a ( complex ) subspace  @xmath97 on which all of the forms in  @xmath98 vanish .",
    "an _ integral variety _ of  @xmath3 is a subvariety  @xmath94 with the property that , at every smooth point  @xmath99 , the tangent space  @xmath100 is an integral element of  @xmath3 .",
    "the general procedure for extracting information about integral varieties of an ideal  @xmath3 is to , first , compute the space of integral elements , which is essentially an algebraic problem and , second , use the integral elements to describe the local submanifolds that are integral varieties of  @xmath3 , which is a differential geometric problem .",
    "one then applies the local description from the second step to deduce global results about algebraic integral varieties of  @xmath3 .    as a guide to the reader ,",
    "i generally call algebraic results about integral elements ` lemmas ' , local differential geometric results ` propositions ' , and global topological or algebro - geometric results ` theorems ' .",
    "thus , the names do not always reflect the degree of difficulty of the corresponding proofs .",
    "in fact , the most difficult arguments in the article tend to be the algebraic arguments that compute the integral elements of a given ideal .",
    "the differential geometric arguments are usually straightforward ( if somewhat involved ) applications of the method of the moving frame .",
    "i do not mean to suggest that some knowledge of exterior differential systems ( eds ) would not be helpful , and the interested reader might want to consult  @xcite . indeed ,",
    "many of the results in this article were first found by doing an exterior differential systems analysis . however , once the results were found , it was possible to prove them without invoking eds theory , so i did .",
    "meanwhile , for the reader familiar with eds theory , i have included comments from time to time that point out eds features that may be of interest .",
    "other readers can safely ignore these comments .",
    "this eds avoidance does not significantly lengthen any of the proofs , so i feel that the savings of not having to introduce and discuss concepts from exterior differential systems justifies this strategy .",
    "the main disadvantage to the reader is that it does not explain why the rigidity results could have been anticipated , making them seem somewhat miraculous .",
    "there is a more general notion that , while it will not play any direct role in this article , will be needed in the discussions of the work of maria walters :    [ def : diff sys ] let  @xmath0 be a complex manifold and let  @xmath20 be an integer satisfying @xmath101 .",
    "let  @xmath102 denote the complex manifold whose elements are the complex @xmath20-planes tangent to  @xmath0 , i.e. , each @xmath103 is an @xmath20-dimensional subspace  @xmath97 for some  @xmath104 .",

    "strictly speaking , such a  @xmath105 should be called a _ first - order _ differential system , but since no other kind will appear in this article , i will leave this as understood .    for any differential ideal  @xmath3 on  @xmath0 and any integer  @xmath20 with  @xmath107 , the space of @xmath20-dimensional integral elements of  @xmath3 defines a differential system  @xmath108 . not every differential system in the above sense is of the form  @xmath109 for some ideal  @xmath3 , so this is a proper generalization .",
    "let  @xmath0 be a compact complex manifold .",
    "for each integer  @xmath2 in the range  @xmath110 , let  @xmath111 denote the semigroup of effective @xmath2-cycles in  @xmath0 .",
    "thus , an element  @xmath68 in  @xmath111 is a formal sum  @xmath112 , where each  @xmath113 is an irreducible , compact , complex , @xmath2-dimensional subvariety .",

    "of course , corollary  [ cor : integral elements of phi - a ] provides an important ` lower bound ' for these integral elements , but the example of  @xmath759 shows that this can be very far from a complete description .    in general , when  @xmath713 , recall that  @xmath542 is generated by the @xmath1317-invariant subspace @xmath1318 . given this ,",
    "is not difficult to show that  @xmath1319 is generated by the forms @xmath1320^p } c_{\\alpha_1\\dots\\alpha_p}\\ , \\omega^{\\alpha_1}_{i_1}{{\\mathchoice{\\,{\\scriptstyle\\wedge}\\,}{{\\scriptstyle\\wedge } }        { { \\scriptscriptstyle\\wedge}}{{\\scriptscriptstyle\\wedge}}}}\\dots{{\\mathchoice{\\,{\\scriptstyle\\wedge}\\,}{{\\scriptstyle\\wedge } }        { { \\scriptscriptstyle\\wedge}}{{\\scriptscriptstyle\\wedge}}}}\\omega^{\\alpha_p}_{i_p}\\,,\\ ] ] where  @xmath1249^p\\to{{\\mathbb c}}$ ] ranges over the elements of  @xmath1321 .",
    "moreover , the forms  @xmath1322 for fixed  @xmath1251 have the same @xmath440-index symmetry as the general element of  @xmath1323 .",
    "consequently , in the notation for integral elements  @xmath1028 that has been employed in this section , one sees that the corresponding matrix  @xmath954 must satisfy the relations @xmath1324^p } c_{\\alpha_1\\dots\\alpha_p}\\ ,    \\xi^{\\alpha_1}_{i_1}{{\\mathchoice{\\,{\\scriptstyle\\wedge}\\,}{{\\scriptstyle\\wedge } }        { { \\scriptscriptstyle\\wedge}}{{\\scriptscriptstyle\\wedge}}}}\\dots{{\\mathchoice{\\,{\\scriptstyle\\wedge}\\,}{{\\scriptstyle\\wedge } }        { { \\scriptscriptstyle\\wedge}}{{\\scriptscriptstyle\\wedge}}}}\\xi^{\\alpha_p}_{i_p}\\,,\\ ] ] where  @xmath1249^p\\to{{\\mathbb c}}$ ] ranges over the elements of  @xmath1321 .",
    "unfortunately , these relations appear to be rather difficult to understand directly except in the simplest cases .    [",
    "ex : i(p ) generators ] consider  @xmath1325 ( where  @xmath1326 , of course ) .",
    "since  @xmath1327 while  @xmath1328 , the above relations are equivalent to @xmath1329 whenever  @xmath1330 .",
    "now , the expression on the right is symmetric in  @xmath1331 , which motivates considering the general linear combination  @xmath1332 and rewriting the above relation in the form @xmath1333 thus , the relations   are equivalent to the condition that the wedge product of any @xmath2 of the entries of any linear combination of the columns of  @xmath954 should vanish .    note that this last formulation is precisely the condition stated by griffiths and harris as  ( * ? ? ? * ( 4.6 ) ) for the vanishing of the chern form  @xmath1334 , as it should be .",
    "however , a glance at the analysis of the integral elements of  @xmath759 shows that this formulation , though an important first step , is still very far from a determination of the integral elements of  @xmath759 .",
    "one strategy for studying the relations   is to choose  @xmath1251 to be a highest weight vector for the representation   @xmath1321 and/or to combine the relations so as to reflect a highest weight vector for  @xmath1335 .",
    "this usually gives the simplest relations .",
    "for example , the formulation   is nothing but considering the relation for the orbit of a highest weight vector in @xmath1336 .",
    "similarly , the relation   that was so fundamental to the analysis of integral elements of  @xmath1247 is merely the relation corresponding to a highest weight vector .",
    "since an irreducible representation is spanned by the orbit of its highest weight vector , all the relations   will be generated by starting with a highest weight relation and considering all the relations it implies after pre- and post - multiplying @xmath954 by arbitrary invertible matrices of the appropriate size .",
    "this was essentially the strategy i used in constructing the proofs of the various lemmas in this section .    finally , since , among all the representations  @xmath1337 with  @xmath669 , the ones with  @xmath1325 and  @xmath1338 are generally the lowest dimensional , the ideals  @xmath1339 and  @xmath1340 are usually the smallest in size .",
    "for that reason , one might expect that their integral elements would display a greater variety than the integral elements for  @xmath540 with other  @xmath259 of the same degree .",
    "this expectation was born out in the degree  @xmath17 case , since the analysis for  @xmath759 and  @xmath1190 was considerably more complicated than the analysis for  @xmath1247 , an ideal with approximately four times as many generators as either of the other two .",
    "the reader experienced with exterior differential systems will know to take this sort of ` dimension count ' with a grain of salt , since it is usually more subtle algebraic features than the rank of an ideal that play the major role in determining the integral elements and integral manifolds .",
    "however , this ` dimension count ' does seem to correspond somewhat to the complexity of the analysis in each case , so i offer it as an observation to the interested reader .",

    "in fact , the node  @xmath3096 is very interesting , corresponding to the representation  @xmath3097 of dimension  @xmath3098 , which is less than 20% of the size of its ` competitor ' at level  @xmath891 , namely the node  @xmath3099 which is the representation  @xmath3097 of dimension  @xmath3100 .",
    "again , note that the ideal  @xmath3101 contains all @xmath137-forms , so that its maximal integrals are @xmath891-dimensional . meanwhile , the ideal  @xmath3102 fails to contain forms of degree as high as  @xmath154 .",
    "it would be interesting to know whether the maximal dimension irreducible integrals of this ideal are the @xmath154-dimensional schubert cycles that correspond to the node  @xmath3081 .    as a final note on size disparity among the ideals",
    ", the node  @xmath3081 corresponds to the representation  @xmath3103 whose dimension is  @xmath3104 , a remarkably small number in comparison with the dimensions associated to the nearby nodes .",
    "one might expect the integrals of the ideal  @xmath3105 to be particularly interesting .",
    "for example , could it be the case that every irreducible integral of  @xmath3105 of dimension at least  @xmath154 lies in one of the @xmath3106-dimensional schubert varieties associated to the node  @xmath3107 ?",
    "( it is evident that these schubert varieties are integrals of @xmath3105 and that this ideal has no integrals of dimension greater than  @xmath3106 . )",
    "i have not done any deep analysis of the ideals on the hermitian symmetric space  @xmath3108 ( which has ( complex ) dimension  @xmath3109 ) , but in this section , i will indicate some of the interesting possibilities that are turned up by a preliminary analysis .",
    "i have not attempted to label the nodes , partly through lack of space .",
    "however , it will be convenient to be able to refer to some of the nodes , so i will do so by coordinates .",
    "thus , the left - most node in the figure has coordinates  @xmath3077 and they continue upwards and to the right as  @xmath363 , @xmath896 , @xmath3078 , with the first case of two nodes at the same level being at level  @xmath891 , namely  @xmath3096 and  @xmath3099 . for each node  @xmath3111",
    ", i will refer to the corresponding ideal on  @xmath3110 by  @xmath3082 .",
    "thus , for example ,  @xmath3082 is generated in degree  @xmath2 and the first interesting ideals are  @xmath3101 and  @xmath3102 . in this notation ,  @xmath3085 and  @xmath3112 .",
    "these nodes could also be labeled by the the highest weight of the corresponding irreducible subrepresentation of  @xmath3087 , where  @xmath3113 , with respect to a maximal torus in  @xmath3114 .",
    "it is traditional to do this by labeling the nodes of the dynkin diagram of  @xmath608 with the coordinates of the highest weight , so i will do this in a compactified form .",
    "thus , the summand  @xmath3090 , which is , of course , irreducible and of dimension  @xmath3109 , will be notated as  @xmath3115 .",
    "it corresponds to the node  @xmath363 .",
    "the node  @xmath3116 is the representation   @xmath3117 of dimension  @xmath3118 , which is only slightly more than one - eighth of the dimension of the representation associated to its ` competitor ' node  @xmath3119 .",
    "note also that  @xmath3120 has irreducible integrals of dimension  @xmath144 , namely the schubert cycles corresponding to the node  @xmath3121",
    ". it would be interesting to know whether any irreducible integral of  @xmath3120 of dimension  @xmath137 or more is a subvariety of one of these @xmath144-dimensional schubert cycles .",
    "the node  @xmath3121 is the representation   @xmath3122 of dimension  @xmath3123 , which is less than one-_eightieth _ of the dimension of  @xmath3124 .",
    "note also that  @xmath3125 has irreducible integrals of dimension  @xmath3126 , namely the schubert cycles corresponding to the node  @xmath3127",
