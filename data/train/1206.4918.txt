    "the physics of interacting coulomb systems has been extensively studied for decades @xcite .",
    "most of this study has been concentrated on the statistical mechanics of electrolytes such as salt solutions . while there still exists a number of outstanding questions concerning the bulk thermodynamics of electrolytes ,",
    "there has been just as intense an effort to understand how the presence of electrolytes modify the interaction between charged surfaces , colloids and macromolecules .",
    "the underlying statistical mechanics problem being to date unsolved , the study of these systems relies on the use of approximations .",
    "the simplest models of electrolytes are called primitive models , where the ions are taken to be point - like charges and the only interactions are electrostatic .    for these simple electrolyte models with charged interfaces ,",
    "two regimes are now reasonably well understood and their results have been validated numerically .",
    "the first is the so called _ weak coupling regime _ where the mean field or poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) theory @xcite correctly describes the system , ignoring fluctuations about the mean field .",
    "these can be taken into account to refine the accuracy of the results .",
    "the pb theory is valid when the distance over which the ions interact with each other ( the bjerrum length ) is smaller than the distance at which they interact with the charged surface ( the gouy - chapman length ) . from another mathematical point of view",
    "the field theory describing interacting charged particles can be analyzed in the saddle point approximation @xcite , and in the regime of its validity the fluctuations renormalize the mean field results improving its accuracy .",
    "the other limiting regime is the so called _ strong coupling regime _ where the problem can be treated within an effectively virial - like expansion based upon the interaction of single particles with the charged surface @xcite .",
    "this regime occurs when the bjerrum length is much large than the gouy - chapman length , which becomes the case as the valency of the ions increases .",
    "the underlying instability in a point - like charge model due to the pairing of anions and cations means that the strong coupling approximation has only been applied to the counter - ion only case in the presence of charged surfaces .",
    "the region between these two limiting regimes is less well understood and a theory extrapolating between the two is still lacking .",
    "results of calculations in these two limiting regimes do not have to be made finite by invoking a finite size of the ions .",
    "this is because ( i ) point charges are smeared out by the pb approximation and ( ii ) as stated above , the strong coupling approximation pertaining to the counter - ion only case , is effectively a one particle theory .",
    "however , it is clear that in certain circumstances steric effects due to the finite size of ions will come into play , not only especially near highly charged bounding surfaces but also in the bulk for systems composed of large charged molecules such as room temperature ionic liquids ( rtils ) .",
    "the presence of a new length scale given by the molecular size now complicates the above discussion of strong and weak coupling regimes , rendering the study of rtils much more complex than simple electrolyte models .",
    "rtils are fluids with large , asymmetric ions where steric effects can not be neglected .",
    "these liquids have a number of practical technological applications @xcite ; for instance , they are used as electrolytes in fuel and solar cells as well as super - capacitors .",
    "the study of bulk properties of ionic liquids was stimulated by attempts to understand critical behavior of electrolytes . here",
    "the effect of finite size ions needs to be taken into account in order to regularize the model .",
    "the restricted primitive model incorporates hard core effects in a continuum context and can be studied via approximate methods from liquid theory , for instance integral equations as well as field theoretic approaches @xcite .",
    "another way to take into account the finite size of ions is to restrict ions to points on a regular lattice ( for a historical sketch of lattice coulomb fluids ( lcf ) see @xcite ) and forbid that there be more than one particle at any given site @xcite .",
    "this is clearly a rather idealized model since it assumes an underlying lattice structure which will influence the thermodynamics of the system and also since it treats the effective molecular sizes of cations and anions as the same .",
    "the study of lcfs in the capacitor configuration is a more recent subject of study .",
    "it is physically clear @xcite that the size of the ionic species will restrict the maximal local charge density that can be locally attained in a rtil , for instance the counter - ion charge density near a highly charged surface will have a maximal value at closest packing . in certain regimes",
    "therefore , we should expect a fundamentally different behavior of ionic liquids at charged interfaces compared with aqueous electrolytes . not withstanding this proviso ,",
    "aspects of the behavior of rtil capacitors can be captured by a mean - field treatment of the lattice coulomb fluid model @xcite .",
    "qualitatively the mean - field treatment of the lcf predicts that steric constraints cause the capacitance of ionic liquids to decay at large applied voltages ( owing to the saturation of counter - ions at the capacitor plates ) . at the point of zero charge ( pzc )",
    "the capacitance can exhibit a maximum and then decay monotonically , however in certain cases it can also be a local minimum , increasing to a maximum value at finite charge and then decaying ( and is thus a non - monotonic function of applied voltage ) .",
    "which of these two capacitance behaviors is predicted by the mean field theory depends on the lattice packing fraction @xcite . for dilute electrolytes",
    "the capacitance at pzc is always a minimum @xcite , steric effects which reduce the capacitance only becoming important at higher voltages .",
    "the basic lcf model also uses a rather simple description of the capacitor plates , neglecting dispersion interactions that will come into play for ions near metallic electrodes and will influence the behavior of ions even at zero applied voltage @xcite . taking into account these dispersion effects ,",
    "that essentially lead to binding of discrete ions to their image charges in the metallic plate , leads to significantly different predictions for ionic distributions at the capacitor plates and consequently to significantly enhanced capacitances .",
    "the effects of these interactions improve the quantitative agreement between theory and experiment .    at an experimental level , x - ray reflectivity @xcite ,",
    "sfa @xcite and afm @xcite studies at charged interfaces show an alternating charge distribution starting with an _ over - screening _",
    "cationic layer , at the negatively charged substrate , which decays roughly exponentially into the bulk liquid with a periodicity comparable with the size of ionic species @xcite .",
    "similar results are found in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the charge layering seen in experiments and simulations is expected to be a generic feature of rtils at sufficiently strongly charged interfaces resulting from an interplay between steric effects and strong electrostatic coupling . while the phenomenology of the differential capacity is described by the mean - field solution of the lcf model @xcite , the over - screening and alternate charge layering at a capacitor plate are not .    in order to explain overcharging and charge oscillations , but staying within the mean field approximation , bazant _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a phenomenological theory based on a landau - ginzburg - like functional containing the standard lcf free energy @xcite but with an additional higher order potential - gradient term , similar to what is found in cahn - hilliard models .",
    "the origin of this higher order gradient term can be justified @xcite via a decomposition of the coulomb interaction into a long - distance mean - field - like component and a non - mean - field strong coupling component @xcite .",
    "this alternative interpretation of the origin of this phenomenological term as a result of strong coupling or correlation effects leads to the natural question as to whether it is the model or the approximation that needs to be modified to understand the physics of these systems .",
    "the latter possibility suggests that a more detailed non - mean - field analysis of the original kornyshev lcf model is appropriate .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we will study the exact solution of the one dimensional ( 1d ) coulomb fluid or gas where all the physics of the basic lcf model can be analyzed . while the physics of this system will be different to the 3d system , it is of interest because we can assess the validity of mean field theory in this case by comparing it with an exact solution .",
    "in addition the 1d lcf corresponds to sheets of charge ( at discrete lattice sites ) , and as experimental results and simulations suggest that a layering phenomena is present , one might hope that this model does contain and possibly explain some of the phenomena of the original 3d system .",
    "indeed we shall see that the phenomena of over - screening , charge oscillations and some of the more exotic behavior of the capacitance of these systems are predicted by our exact solution .",
    "the conclusion of the paper is that it is quite possible that some of the physics of rtil capacitors can be explained by the lcf model if the model is properly treated at the mathematical level .",
    "we thus propose an exact analysis , albeit in 1d , that demonstrates the full physical phenomenology of the lcf model , and in particular show that charge density oscillations , over - screening , and oscillations in the capacitance emerge naturally from this model without the introduction of any new physical interactions .",
    "a short version of this work can be found in @xcite , the version here fully details the calculations as well as presents a new mathematical analysis of the exact solution , in particular to explain the surface charging through a fixed applied voltage for large capacitor plates .",
    "the physical properties of the systems are discussed in greater detail as well as the relationship between the exact result and the corresponding mean - field theory .",
    "finally , given the rather rich and exotic behavior found in our analytical approach we have confirmed our analytic results by comparing them with extensive monte carlo simulations of the 1d lcf .",
    "here we describe the one dimensional lcf and show how it can be formally solved exactly .",
    "the first exact solutions of the one dimensional coulomb fluid or gas are due to lenard and edwards @xcite where the bulk properties of a point - like model of ions was studied .",
    "the problem was then analyzed in a more mathematical context @xcite , and the peculiar dependence of the bulk free energy on the electric field applied to such a system was elucidated .",
    "later the effective interactions between charged surfaces in this model was studied @xcite in the presence of counter and co - ions and counter - ions only .",
    "these studies were also used to benchmark the range of validity of the various approximation schemes ( strong and weak coupling ) discussed in the introduction . here",
    "we present a formally exact solution to the lcf in one dimension based on a functional transfer matrix formalism which can be used to extract , numerically , all thermodynamical observables to any required numerical precision .",
    "we consider a one dimensional system where sheets of density @xmath0 ( cations ) or @xmath1 ( anions ) can sit at points on a lattice of size @xmath2 and lattice spacing @xmath3 .",
    "if we assume that the system has an effective surface area @xmath4 , the effective one dimensional coulomb hamiltonian can be written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the dielectric constant within the bulk of the ionic liquid .     and @xmath2 .",

    "we have also introduced the dimensionless parameter @xmath16 which is the ratio of the electrostatic energy between two ions at neighboring sites to the typical thermal energy @xmath17 .",
    "note that the overall charge of an ion in this notation is @xmath18 and in this notation @xmath19 above the trace is over the spin values @xmath7 at each site and the integral over the field @xmath20 enforces the electroneutrality constraint .",
    "we notice that the integral over @xmath20 may be translated , it just has to run over an interval of length @xmath21 . carrying out a hubbard - stratonovitch transformation gives @xmath22\\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2\\gamma}\\int\\left[{d\\phi(x)\\over dx}\\right]^2 dx+i\\sum_is_j\\phi(j)\\right),\\label{pf1}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is a normalization constant which can be determined at the end of the computation imposing that the grand partition function without ions ( @xmath24 ) should be equal to one .",

    "this result is in accordance with standard thermodynamic relations and is exploited in numerical simulations of systems with fixed voltage drops across them @xcite .",
    "there is a clear difference between the two ensembles . in the constant charge ensemble",

    "in the mean field approximation , we compute the partition function by the saddle - point approximation , minimizing the argument of the exponential function . in eq .",

    "this representation is essentially a 1d coulomb lattice gas version of the villain representation for the 2d coulomb gases @xcite and is also related to the electric field representation of the coulomb gas used by aizenman and frhlich @xcite . in the limit of large @xmath122",
    "it is clear that the process @xmath118 will be dominated by paths which start at zero and then stay as close as possible to the value @xmath65 .",

    "it thus reveals which characteristics of the exact solution can be captured by the mean - field theory .",
    "it seems that while the mean field theory successfully predicts overall trends and orders of magnitude , it fails to pick up on oscillatory behavior in charge distributions and some rather exotic behavior in the charge - voltage capacitor characteristics of the model .",
    "the study suggests that the simple lcf model can lead to a variety of phenomena which are somehow washed out by the mean field approach , charge distribution oscillations , over - screening and very exotic behavior of the capacitance . because the behavior predicted by our exact solution was so unexpected",
    "we have verified our analytical predictions by comparing them with numerical simulations of the 1d model and have shown them to be accurate .",
    "another point which should be made is that in contrast to @xcite we developed a discrete mean - field theory on the lattice rather than taking a continuum limit .",
    "this is an important point as we show that even the discrete mean - field theory does not reproduce the various oscillatory phenomena mentioned above , which are thus not a simply consequence of a discrete lattice and the charge oscillations that we see are therefore due to _ correlations _ rather than being an artifact due to the introduction of a lattice .    in concluding",
    ", we should also emphasize that the 1d model has certain pathologies that are not present in a three dimensional system , notably the lack of screening of the surface charges in systems with large plate separations .",
    "if we would like to make a link with experimental systems it is clear that the simple picture of charged sheets would need to be modified .",
    "the state space of the charge on the sheets here is rather cartoon - like with just three values and just two bare weights for the presence of the charges @xmath239 or @xmath240 ( given by the fugacity @xmath15 ) .",
    "an extension of this model would be to introduce a larger set of dynamical values for the charges on the sheets and it may even be possible to find an effective one dimensional lattice model from a complete three dimensional model by exploiting the layering parallel to the plates that should be induced by an applied voltage , perhaps via renormalization group type arguments .",
    "we finally note that the results of numerical simulations agree with those of the theoretical calculations and therefore confirm the equivalence of the spin and scalar field formulations as well as the use of the fourier method to carry out the exact theoretical calculation .",
