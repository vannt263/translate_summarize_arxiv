    "accretion onto black holes has been intensely studied for the last three decades , in order to explain observed luminosities of galactic black hole candidates and agns , their spectral states , and the formation of jets or outflows around black hole candidates .",
    "since black holes have neither hard surface , nor intrinsic atmosphere from which outflows may originate , jets / outflows has to originate from the accreting matter .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that jets originate from accretion discs which are in hard spectral states .",
    "this fact suggests that the origin of jet is strongly correlated with the spectral state of the accretion disc , and therefore with the accretion process itself .    the unique inner boundary condition for accretion onto a black hole , necessarily demands that the black hole accretion is globally transonic .",
    "@xcite showed that transonic matter suffers centrifugal pressure mediated shock , and the shock is located further out as the specific energy and the specific angular momentum of the flow is increased .",
    "such a shocked accretion disc model was used to compute the spectral states of the black hole candidates @xcite , where the post - shock tori  cenbol ( centrifugal pressure supported boundary layer ) , produces the hard power - law tail by inverse - comptonizing the softer photons from the outer disc .",
    "moreover , it has also been shown , both numerically @xcite and analytically @xcite , that the extra thermal gradient force in the cenbol drives a significant portion of accreting matter as bipolar outflows .",
    "in particular , @xcite showed that outflows from cenbol are generated in hard spectral states of accretion discs .",
    "these bipolar outflows are believed to be the precursor of astrophysical jets .",
    "so far , there is no theoretical attempt to compute mass outflow rates from a viscous advective disc .",
    "as viscous flow approaches the black hole , the local angular momentum of the flow decreases while the local energy increases .",
    "thus , in a viscous flow there are two competing processes to determine the shock formation .",
    "should the shock move inwards as we increase the viscosity for flows with identical outer boundary conditions or vice - versa ?",
    "how would the position of shock affect the mass outflow rates ? we are going to address the above mentioned issues in the present paper .    in the next section ,",
    "we present the model assumptions and the equations of motion of the disc - jet system . in  3 , we present the solution procedure . in  4",
    ", we present the results , and in the last section we draw concluding remarks .",
    "we begin with a steady , viscous , axisymmetric accretion flow on to a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the space - time property is approximated by the paczyski - wiita potential @xcite .",
    "in addition , jets are considered to be inviscid .",
    "outflows are supposed to be lighter than the accretion disc , and definitely of lower angular momentum than at least the outer edge of the disc .",
    "consequently , the differential rotation is expected to be much less than that in the accretion disc .",
    "therefore , viscosity in jets can be ignored . in fig .",
    "1 , a schematic diagram of an advective accretion disc - jet system is presented . in this figure the pre - shock flow , the shock location ( @xmath0 ) , the post - shock flow ( abbreviated as cenbol ) and the jet between the funnel wall ( fw ) and centrifugal barrier ( cb ) have been marked .",
    "we define fw and cb in  2.2 .",

    "as viscosity is enhanced , @xmath127 is increased and @xmath14 is decreased along the flow . at the shock , the effect of energy increment , can not compensate the effect due to angular momentum reduction .",

    "so far , we have shown that the mass outflow rates strongly depends on shock location @xmath0 , and formation of shock itself depends crucially on the viscosity parameter .",
    "we have also shown that shocks form closer to the black hole for viscous flows than in inviscid accretion flow .",
    "however , we are yet to comment on the observational consequence of such phenomena . admittedly , it is beyond the scope of the present paper to compute the detailed spectrum of the flow , but we would like to make some qualitative remarks on the spectral properties of such flows .",
    "it is to be remembered , @xcite showed that hard power law photons were generated at cenbol by inverse - comptonization of soft photons from the pre - shock region of the disc .",
    "thus we calculate the optical depth of the cenbol , as this provides a qualitative understanding of the nature of the spectrum .",
    "the definition of the optical depth for photons entering the cenbol is given by , @xmath156 where , @xmath157 is the opacity assuming thompson scattering cross - section , and @xmath11 is the density of the flow .",

    "therefore most of the soft photons entering the cenbol fails to sample the inner part of the disc . in presence of mass loss ( dotted ) ,",
    "the density of the cenbol is lowered which reduces its optical depth . for viscous flow ( dashed ) ,",
    "optical depth is much lower compared to the inviscid flow ( solid ) as the shock forms ( @xmath169 ) closer to the black hole .",
    "if we allow mass loss ( dashed - dotted ) , the optical depth is reduced further . therefore , most of the soft photons coming from the pre - shock region could interact with the hot electrons of the inner part of the disc ( @xmath170 at @xmath171 ) and there by cool it .",
    "a cooler cenbol will evidently produce softer spectrum compared to the inviscid case .",
    "chakrabarti ( 1998 ) calculated spectrum of a inviscid disc which is loosing mass from the post - shock region , and indeed he found that the spectrum softens , which correspond to solutions similar to the dotted curve . from our self - consistent study , we predict that the twin effects of viscosity and mass loss will soften the spectrum even further .",
    "early studies of transonic accretion flow showed the existence of standing or oscillating shocks @xcite .",
    "the presence of shocks were also thought to be the real cause behind hard state of the disc spectrum @xcite , and also generating outflows @xcite .",
    "studies of shocks in viscous accretion disc were also undertaken , but were confined to obtain the global solution for accretion flows with or without shocks and/or the detailed study of the parameter space @xcite .",
    "important as they are , since a proper understanding enhances the grasp on the physics of such flows , no attempts have been undertaken to link these viscous flows with observables such as outflows and spectrum . in this paper",
    "we have extended our earlier computation of mass loss @xcite , by employing the knowledge of viscous disc solutions @xcite . in the earlier paper @xcite ,",
    "the disc was considered to be inviscid and the jet was non - rotating .",
    "furthermore , the shock condition was not modified for mass loss .",
    "presently , we have included viscosity and considered rotating outflows , in particular we have concentrated on studying how viscosity affects shocks and in turn , how shocks affect the mass outflow rates .",
    "we have shown that mass loss from the post - shock disc reduces post - shock total pressure , and hence the shock front moves towards the black hole .",
    "we have also shown that the mass outflow rate depends on the energy , as well as the angular momentum of the flow , and increasing both , in turn , increases the mass outflow rate .",
    "however , less energetic accretion will produce lower mass outflow rates , even though angular momentum is increased outward , by increasing the viscosity parameter .",
    "more interestingly , we have shown that outflow rate decreases with the increase of viscosity parameter for flows with same outer boundary conditions .",
    "this is due to the weakening of centrifugal barrier with the increase of viscosity parameter .",
    "we have also shown that the post shock optical depth decreases in presence of viscosity and mass loss , which may soften the emitted spectrum .",
    "a detailed study of spectrum from such viscous discs , by including cooling processes is under consideration and will be reported elsewhere .",
