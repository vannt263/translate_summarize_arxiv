    ", the companion fills its roche lobe at ms or during hg , and transfers material onto the wd .",
    "if the mass - transfer rate , @xmath4 , exceeds a critical value , @xmath5 , they assumed that the accreted hydrogen steadily burns on the surface of wd and that the hydrogen - rich material is converted into helium at the rate of @xmath5 .",
    "the unprocessed matter is assumed to be lost from the system as an optically thick wind at a rate of @xmath6 ( hachisu et al .",
    "the hydrogen - rich material lost as the optically thick wind may exist as csm .",
    "if the wd explodes at the wind phase , the csm locates near the sn ia , which may show the signal similar to sn 2006x ( hachisu et al .",

    ", we assume that if sn ia explodes during the optically thick wind phase , it is a supernova like sn 2006x .",
    "we use the rapid binary evolution code developed by hurley et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2002 ) to study the birth rate of supernovae like sn 2006x . to investigate the birth rate",
    ", we followed the evolution of @xmath7 binaries .",
    "the primordial binary samples are generated in a monte carlo way and a circular orbit is assumed for all binaries .",
    "the basic parameters for the simulations are the same as that in meng , chen & han ( 2009 ) . in theory , when the initial wd mass in a binary system is smaller than @xmath8 , the wd never explodes at the optically thick wind phase ( hachisu et al .",
    "2008 ; meng , yang & geng 2009 ; meng , chen & han 2009 ) .",
    "meng , chen & han ( 2009 ) have shown the parameter spaces for the supernovae exploding at the wind phase ( see fig . 2 in meng , chen & han 2009 ) , and",
    "we assume that these supernovae are those like sn 2006x . for our binary population synthesis study",
    ", we assume that if the initial orbital - period , @xmath9 , and the initial secondary mass , @xmath10 , of a wd + ms system is located in the appropriate regions in the ( @xmath11 ) plane for supernovae like sn 2006x at the onset of rlof , a 2006x - like supernova is produced .    for our bps study , common - envelope ( ce ) ejection efficiency ( @xmath12 ,",
    "the fraction of the released orbital energy used to eject the ce ) is a very important parameter , and in this paper , we set @xmath12 to be 1.0 or 3.0 .",
    "two cases for star formation history are checked , i.e. a single starburst and a constant star formation rate ( @xmath13 ) over the last 15 gyr . for the constant star formation rate",
    ", we assume that one binary with primary larger than @xmath14 is born in the galaxy each year ( see iben & tutukov 1984 ; han , podsiadlowski & eggleton 1995 ; hurley et al .",
    "2002 ) . from this calibration",
    ", we can get @xmath15 @xmath16 ( see also willems & kolb 2004 ) .",
    "with different @xmath17 .",
    "the thick lines are for all the sne ia , while the thin lines are for those like sn 2006x . ]    in figs .",
    "[ single ] and [ const ] , we show the evolution of the birth rates for all sne ia and supernovae like sn 2006x with a single starburst and a constant star formation rate , respectively . from the two figures",
    ", we can see that sne similar to sn 2006x are a relatively rare subclass of sne ia : 1 - 14 in 100 sne ia can be of this type , which depends on the @xmath12 . the observational results in blondin et al .",
    "( 2009 ) indicated that out of 100 sne ia , about 6 supernovae should belong to the subclass of 2006x - like objects .",
    "the probability is located in the range given in this paper , even that sn 2007le is included .    in the figures",
    ", we can see that @xmath12 affects the birth rate significantly .",
    "high @xmath12 results in a lower birth rate .",
    "this result results from the influence of @xmath12 on the channels forming wd + ms systems .",
    "there are three channels to form wd + ms systems : he star channel , eagb channel and tpagb channel . the classification is based on the evolutionary phase of the primordial primary at the onset of the first roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) , which means that the primordial primary is in hg or on rgb ( i.e. case b evolution defined by kippenhahn & weigert ( 1967 ) , in early asymptotic giant branch stage ( eagb ) ( i.e. helium is exhausted in the core , while thermal pulses have not yet started ) or at the thermal pulsing agb ( tpagb ) stage for he star , eagb and tpagb channels , respectively ( see meng , chen & han 2009 for the channels in details ) . because of the low binding energy of the common envelope and a long primordial orbital period , @xmath12 has a remarkable influence on co + wd systems from the tpagb channel .",
    "generally , if a ce can be ejected , a low @xmath12 produces a shorter orbital - period wd + ms system , which is more likely to fulfill the conditions for sne ia .",
    "therefore , we see obvious contributions from the tpagb channel when @xmath18 , but no contribution from this channel when @xmath19 .",
    "this is reason why a high @xmath12 leads to low birth rate .    from fig .",
    "[ single ] , we can see that if sn 2006x is originated from a wd + ms system as suggested in this paper , the delayed time of 2006x - like object is constrained in a very narrow range , i.e. @xmath20 .",
    "this provides a rigorous constraint on the age of the object like sn 2006x .",
    "we will discuss it in the next section .",
    "but for a constant star formation rate ( @xmath21 ) . ]",
    "sn 2006x is the first case that show a variable na i d line in its spectral , which clearly shows a signal of csm ( patat et al .",
    "patat et al . (",
    "2007 ) also noticed a relatively low expansion velocity of the csm ( @xmath22 @xmath23 ) .",
    "the low expansion velocity seems to imply that the progenitor of sn 2006x belongs to a wd + rg systems .",
    "however , hachisu et al . (",
    "2008 ) showed that under the assumption of the optically thick wind , the wd + ms system also may produce the low - velocity csm . in this paper , we show that if sn 2006x is from a wd + ms system with the optically thick wind , the age of its progenitor is smaller than 1 gyr , which implies that there is star formation during the recent 1 gyr in its host galaxy .",
    "the host galaxy of sn 2006x , ngc 4321 ( m100 ) , is a well - studied spiral galaxy ( e.g. ho et al . 1997 ) and sn 2006x locates near one of its arms ( wang et al .",
    "as one of the largest spiral galaxies in the virgo cluster , it produced sne 1901b , 1914a , 1959e , 1979c , and 2006x in roughly the last century and shows significant signal of star formation at present ( kanpen et al .",
    "1993 , 1996 ) .",
    "recently , blondin et al .",
    "( 2009 ) found a similar signal to that of sn 2006x in another sne ia ( sn 1999cl ) in archives .",
    "its host galaxy , ngc4501 ( m88 ) , is also a spiral galaxy and sn 1999cl locates at one of its arms ( krisciunas et al . 2000 ) . during the last 1 gyr ,",
    "the star formation is significant in the galaxy ( wong & blitz 2002 ) .",
    "the host galaxy of sn 2007le ( ngc 7721 ) is a sc galaxy , and a recent star formation is also expected ( iglesias - pramo et al .",
    "2006 ; simon et al .",
    "so , all the supernovae fulfill the age constraint from wd + ms system .      following the study of meng , chen & han ( 2009 ) , in this paper , we show the evolution of birth rate of supernovae like sn 2006x by assuming that if a sn ia explodes at the optically thick wind phase , it is a 2006x - like supernova .",
    "based on the assumption , we can reproduce the birth rate of 2006x - like objects .",
    "please keep in mind that we only consider the case of wd + ms channel in this paper .",
    "however , the progenitor of sn 2006x is still an open question .",
    "patat et al . (",
    "2007 ) suggested that the progenitor of sn 2006x belongs to wd + rg system such a rs oph based on the velocity of absorptions line of na i d. l et al .",
    "( 2009 ) designed a wd + rg model with an aspherical stellar wind and equatorial disk , and then they may explain some properties of sn 2006x . however , the birth rate of 2006x - like objects obtained in l et al .",
    "( 2009 ) is too low ( less than 1% ) to compare with that observed .",
    "based on the assumption of the optically thick wind and a mass - stripping effect , hachisu et al .",
    "( 2008 ) argued that the progenitor of sn 2006x should be a wd + ms system and they also can well explain the properties of sn 2006x .",
    "although the treatment of binary evolution in meng , chen & han ( 2009 ) is different from that in hachisu et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , meng , chen & han ( 2009 ) obtained similar results for the sne ia exploding at the optically thick wind phase , e.g. there is no supernova explosion at the optically thick wind phase when the initial mass of co wd is smaller than 0.9 @xmath24 .",
    "so , considering the results in this paper , all the properties of sn 2006x can be explained by the wd + ms channel with the optically thick wind , including its birth rate and its age .",
    "then , we suggest that the progenitor of supernovae like sn 2006x is wd + ms system , not wd + rg system .",
