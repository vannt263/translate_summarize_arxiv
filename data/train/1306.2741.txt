    "it is easy to check that we have defined a cell decomposition .",
    "note that the boundary of the @xmath248-dimensional cell , the cell of lowest possible positive dimension , is the point at infinity .",
    "the elements at the boundary of any cell are those for which the inequality between two coordinates @xmath249 in one of the sets @xmath250 becomes equality or those for which some coordinate @xmath251 is @xmath252 .",

    "we consider the irreducible representation on the orthogonal complement and denote it by @xmath265 .",
    "associated to this representation there is an @xmath78-dimensional vector bundle @xmath266 given by @xmath267 .",

    "theorem  [ top ] is equivalent to the nonexistence of nowhere - zero sections of the vector bundle @xmath270 .",
    "the strategy is to show that the zero sets of two generic sections are homologous and compute their homology class by exhibiting a particular generic section .      forgetting the labels , there is only one tree with @xmath271 vertices so @xmath272 has only one cell generator which we will denote by  @xmath273 .",
    "now we exhibit a section @xmath274 of @xmath266 that is transversal to the zero section and such that the pullback of the zero section by @xmath274 is the cell @xmath273 .",

    "the cells generating @xmath284 correspond to trees with one vertex of each level from @xmath223 to @xmath285 , two vertices of level @xmath20 , and @xmath0 vertices of level @xmath0 .",

    "the points lie on lines @xmath291 and @xmath292 parallel to the last coordinate axis ; we assume that @xmath291 is lexicographically before @xmath292 , and we let @xmath293 be the number of points on @xmath291 and @xmath294 be the number of points on @xmath292 .",

    "this set of @xmath289 generators is a basis of @xmath288 .",
    "since @xmath296 , understanding the @xmath248-homology boils down to understanding @xmath297 .",
    "we did not mention the homology coefficients up to this point , but here the choice of coefficients becomes crucial .      for @xmath39 , we take coefficients in the field @xmath298 .",
    "the boundary map annihilates the following multiples of @xmath273 for @xmath299 @xmath300 this is easy to see as follows : consider a configuration @xmath301 in the cell @xmath273 .",

    "@xmath314 ( see @xcite for the details ) , the euler class of @xmath270 with mod @xmath235 coefficients coincides with the top stiefel - whitney class , which is amenable to induction on @xmath6 , using the knowledge about the cohomology of the wreath product of spaces .",
    "note that the base of the induction corresponds to the borsuk ",
    "ulam theorem ( see @xcite ) .",
    "generally , the map  @xmath274 has a unique transversal to zero in @xmath315 , which establishes theorem  [ top ] immediately .",
    "we now recall what homology with twisted coefficients is .",
    "the cellular decomposition of @xmath316 is invariant under the action of @xmath36 .",
    "moreover , all the cells except the point at infinity are permuted by @xmath36 freely .",

    "the cells of dimension @xmath271 can be described as orbits of the following cells : let @xmath334 be the cell of configurations with first @xmath293 points on @xmath291 and the last @xmath335 points on @xmath292 , two vertical lines on a @xmath235-plane perpendicular to the first @xmath285 vectors of a standard basis .",
    "we also assume that the point order on @xmath291 and @xmath292 is consistent with the indexing .",
    "the cell @xmath334 is explicitly given by relations ( here the subscript is the index of a point in the list , and the superscript is its coordinate ) : @xmath336    now it remains to calculate the coefficient of the restriction @xmath337 . in @xcite",
    "this coefficient was shown to be @xmath338 up to sign for @xmath83 ; in fact , the computation yields the same result for any @xmath339 , because the coordinates @xmath340 remain the same for all points in @xmath334 and @xmath341 .",
    "we now show a detailed calculation .",
    "recall that for any @xmath342 we orient @xmath332 so that the map @xmath343 preserves the orientation . clearly , this orientation coincides with the orientation given by the form @xmath344 ( here @xmath345 denotes the common value of @xmath346 for @xmath340 ) if and only if @xmath326 is an even permutation .",

    "we orient @xmath334 by the form @xmath347 .",
    "the boundary  @xmath348 corresponds to approaching the equality @xmath349 from the side @xmath350 and it is therefore oriented in @xmath348 by the form @xmath351 . thus we obtain : @xmath352 where the subset @xmath353 consists of permutations @xmath326 such that @xmath354 obviously , @xmath355 . for the homology with twisted coefficients",
    "we need to calculate : @xmath356 the last equality holds since every @xmath357 can be represented as @xmath358 for @xmath359 in precisely @xmath338 ways .",
    "since @xmath0 is a power of a prime @xmath5 , we have the following congruence of polynomials in @xmath360 : @xmath361 which implies that all the binomial coefficients @xmath338 for @xmath362 are divisible by  @xmath5 .",
    "hence all the coefficients of the boundary operator , @xmath363 are divisible by @xmath5 and @xmath308 $ ] does represent a nonzero homology mod @xmath5 .",

    "coefficients the leftmost identity of the formula ( [ diff - coeff ] ) still holds but the corresponding cycle @xmath366 may not be divisible by @xmath338 .",
    "since the set of generic sections is dense it suffices to prove that a generic section of @xmath270 attains zero somewhere .",
    "informally , a section without zeros can be made generic without acquiring any zeros .",
    "let @xmath367 be a @xmath36-equivariant vector bundle over the open manifold @xmath219 .",
    "the action of @xmath36 on @xmath219 changes the orientation ( by the sign action of @xmath36 ) if and only if @xmath8 is odd ; it changes the orientation of @xmath368 if and only if @xmath8 is even .",
    "hence , it always changes the orientation of @xmath369 .",
    "consider the linear interpolation between any two generic @xmath36-equivariant sections @xmath370 and @xmath360 of @xmath371 , i.e. , the section @xmath372 .",
    "after an appropriate perturbation for @xmath373 this section over @xmath185\\times f_n({\\mathbb{r}}^d)$ ] becomes transversal to zero and its zero set induces a bordism between the zero sets @xmath374 and @xmath375 .",
    "the zero sets are ( not necessarily compact ) manifolds .",
    "the bordism is not necessarily compact so some care needs to be taken .",
    "before we deal with the compactness issue observe that the bordism is @xmath36-equivariant , and let us show that the orientations are in accordance with the sign action of @xmath36 .",
    "let @xmath158 be the zero set of a generic section and @xmath376 its normal bundle in @xmath369 .",

    "hence , we treat zero sets of sections as @xmath36-equivariant cycles with the sign action of @xmath36 on their orientation .",

    "now we deal with the compactness issue .",
    "we first do it via compact support homology .",
    "the bordism between @xmath379 and @xmath380 is not necessarily compact but it is locally compact in @xmath219 .",
    "hence the zero sections represent well defined classes in the compact support homology and their bordism implies that they are homologous . since we have already established that @xmath382 = [ e ] \\not=0 $ ] in @xmath383 , this means that @xmath384 $ ] also represents a nontrivial class and therefore @xmath380 is not empty as a set .",
    "now we provide an alternative to the last part of the proof without reference to compact support homology with standard notions of singular homology .",
    "we will cut out a submanifold with boundary @xmath385 from @xmath219 so that the bordism between @xmath379 and @xmath380 restricts to a compact bordism between the relative cycles @xmath386 $ ] and @xmath387 $ ] , and the pullback of the class @xmath308 $ ] , represented by @xmath386 $ ] , does not vanish in @xmath388 .",
    "observe that the pair @xmath389 was actually realized as follows : we considered @xmath219 as a subset of @xmath390 , such that its complement @xmath391 is a union of several linear subspaces of @xmath390 .",
