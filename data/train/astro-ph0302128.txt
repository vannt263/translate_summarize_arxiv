    "according to the current paradigm , millisecond pulsars ( msps ) are old neutron stars ( nss ) _ recycled _ through accretion of matter and angular momentum from a mass - losing companion in a binary system ( alpar et al .",
    "1982 ) . because the accretion process powers a copious x - ray emission , the progenitors of the millisecond pulsars are believed to form a subset of the population of the bright x - ray binaries ( see e.g. bhattacharya & srinivasan 1995 ) ; namely , those classified as neutron star low mass x - ray binaries ( ns  lmxbs : see e.g. white , nagase & parmar 1995 for a review ) , in which a relatively light k or m star orbits a neutron star and overflows its roche lobe with the mass transfer is mediated by a keplerian disk .    in a handful of these systems",
    "the spin frequency of the ns has been estimated from either coherent pulsations detected during type - i bursts or , indirectly , from the difference of the frequencies of the peaks of the kilohertz quasi periodic oscillations ( khz - qpos ) seen in the x - ray power spectrum of the source ( e.g. van der klis 2000 or strohmayer 2001 ) . in the latter case ,",
    "the frequency difference @xmath0 is interpreted as representative of the spin rate of the ns or of an overtone ( miller , lamb & psaltis 1998 , but see stella & vietri 1998 for a different interpretation ) .",
    "a more accurate analysis has demonstrated that , at least in some cases , @xmath0 is not constant ( e.g. van der klis et al .",
    "1997 ; mendez & van der klis 1999 ) ; however , when both the khz - qpos and the coherent pulsations during type - i bursts can be observed , the inferred rotational periods are almost identical and cluster in the interval 1.83.8 ms for all the known sources . in the last few years , three transient sources ( sax  j1808.4@xmath13658 , wijnands & van der klis 1998 , 1751 - 305 , markwardt et al .",
    "2002 and xte  929 - 314 , galloway et al .",
    "2002 ) have been discovered to emit coherent pulsations during the entire outburst event .",
    "these sources are the first examples of accretion - powered msps .",
    "the spin rates inferred from all these sources can be coupled with other requirements imposed by the accretion process for constraining the ns magnetic moment ( white & zhang 1997 ; burderi & king 1998 ; psaltis & chakrabarty 1999 ; burderi et al .",
    "2002 ) , resulting in values spanning the interval @xmath2 g@xmath3@xmath4 in summary , all the available data strongly support the hypothesis that the ns ",
    "lmxbs host neutron stars spun up to millisecond periods and having surface magnetic field intensity in the range of those observed in the ( spin - powered ) msps .",
    "despite all these clues , there is no direct proof of their being the msp progenitors .",
    "detection of radio signals pulsating at the rotational rate of the ns from some of these sources would provide this proof .",
    "a common requirement of the models of the radio emission mechanism from a rotating , magnetized ns is that a radio pulsar phase begins once the space surrounding the ns is free of external matter up to the light cylinder radius @xmath5 ( at which the speed of material rigidly rotating with the ns would be equal to the speed of light ) : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the pulse period in ms . during the roche - lobe overflow phase ,",
    "the plasma spilling through the inner lagrangian point of the binary system settles into an accretion disc , whose inner rim is located at the so - called magnetospheric radius @xmath8 that radius results equal to a fraction @xmath9 of the alfvn radius , at which the pressure of the ( assumed dipolar ) ns magnetic field balances the ram pressure of the ( assumed spherically ) infalling matter : @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the magnetic moment in units of @xmath12 g@xmath3@xmath13 , @xmath14 is the accretion rate in eddington units ( for a @xmath15 cm stellar radius the eddington accretion rate is @xmath16 m@xmath17 yr@xmath18 and scales with the radius of the compact object ) , @xmath19 is the ns mass in solar masses , and @xmath20 is the ns radius @xmath21 in units of @xmath15 cm .",
    "all these units are scaled to the parameters of a typical ns  lmxb , as inferred from the aforementioned observations and modeling .",
    "as long as @xmath22 is smaller than @xmath23 the infalling plasma penetrates deeply in the ns magnetosphere and prevents the coherent emission of radio waves .",
    "hence , bright ns ",
    "lmxbs showing steady x - ray luminosity are unsuitable targets for observing radio pulses .",
    "however , among the ns ",
    "lmxbs known in the galaxy , @xmath24 experience recurrent x - ray activity separated by longer phases of relative _ quiescence _ ( tanaka & shibazaki 1996 ) .",
    "they are known as neutron star soft x - ray transients ( ns  sxts ) , belonging to the larger class of the x - ray novae .",
    "the physical mechanism driving the transient behaviour of these objects is not fully understood yet ( tanaka & shibazaki 1996 ) , although a promising model invokes thermal disc instabilities coupled with the stabilizing effects of the illumination of the outer disc by the x - ray from the central source ( king , kolb & burderi 1996 ; van paradijs 1996 ) .    during an outburst ,",
    "the typical luminosity in the 0.5@xmath110 kev band peaks between 10@xmath25 and 10@xmath26 erg / s ( chen , shrader & livio 1997 ) and the frequent observation of type - i bursts unambiguously indicate that massive accretion onto the ns surface is responsible . as a consequence ,",
    "coherent radio emission can not occur in this phase .",
    "more recently , also the 0.5@xmath110 kev luminosity in quiescence has been detected , at levels ranging between 10@xmath27 and 10@xmath28 erg / s ( campana et al .",

    "1987 ; yi et al .",
    "1996 ) and shock emission from an enshrouded rapidly spinning pulsar ( stella et al .",
    "1994 ) were originally proposed to account for this lower - luminosity emission .",
    "detailed studies of the x - ray spectrum in quiescence ( rutledge et al .",
    "2001 ) and of the thermal relaxation of the ns crust during this phase ( colpi et al .",
    "2001 ) now suggest that the cooling of the periodically warmed up ns surface ( brown et al .",
    "1998 ) is the more viable explanation for the bulk of the soft x - ray luminosity in quiescence .",
    "if this is the correct interpretation , during the x - ray quiescent phase @xmath29 and thus , plausibly @xmath30 the time scale for the expansion of the magnetospheric radius beyond the light cylinder radius , in response to a sudden drop of the mass transfer rate , is much shorter ( burderi et al .",
    "2001 ) than the typical duration ( @xmath31 years ) of a phase of quiescence in a ns  sxt , in principle allowing the radio pulsar to switch on . while inverse compton scattering from the thermal photons of the quiescent x - ray emission could in principle play a role in absorbing the electrons of the primary beam ( hence inhibiting radio emission ) in the case of high magnetic field pulsars ( zhang , qiao & han 1997 , harding & muslimov 2002 ) , the same picture seems hardly appliable to the magnetosphere of millisecond pulsars ( supper & trumper 2000 ) .    with this picture in mind , we have undertaken a systematic deep search for millisecond pulsations at 1.4 ghz in six ns ",

    "the nominal gain and system temperature of the system were 0.67 k / jy and 22 k , respectively .",
    "after detection , the two orthogonally polarized signals are fed through a multichannel filterbank , in order to minimize the pulse broadening due to dispersion in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the outputs from each channel are summed in polarisation pairs , integrated and 1-bit digitized every 0.125 ms .",
    "the resulting time series are stored on digital linear tapes for offline analysis .",
    "in general we used one of two filterbanks : the first splits the signal into 96 3 mhz@xmath1wide channels covering a total bandwidth of 288 mhz ; the second has 256 channels , each 0.25 mhz wide , for a total bandwidth of 64 mhz . for the source ks 1731@xmath1260 ( observed in march 2001 )",
    "we used a filterbank with 512 0.5 mhz channels , giving a total band of 256 mhz , which became available recently .",
    "the observations lasted @xmath32 hrs for each target ; we have split the collected data in segments of different length , typically containing from @xmath33 to @xmath34 samples , corresponding to @xmath35 min and 35 min , respectively .",

    "the data are de - dispersed according to 325 trial dm values ranging from 0.14 to 207.5 pc@xmath36 for the 96-channel filterbank , or 865 trial dm values in the interval between 0.56 and 2277.2 pc@xmath36 for the 256-channel filterbank , or 1731 trial values ranging from 0.16 to 1293.6 pc@xmath37 for the 512-channel filterbank .",
    "lower and upper limits for the searched dms correspond respectively to a broadening of 0.125 ms ( i.e. equal to the sampling time ) over the whole band and to a broadening of 2 ms in a single channel ( above which the detection of a typical msp becomes questionable ) .",
    "subsequently , each de - dispersed time series is transformed using a fast fourier transform and the highest peaks in the power spectrum ( and in the power spectra resulting from 5 steps of harmonic summing ; see manchester et al .",

    "are then sorted in order of decreasing s / n , rejecting , when possible , signals due to known interference .",

    "the equation that describes the minimum detectable flux density for a pulsar of period @xmath40 is ( e.g. manchester et al .  1996 ) : @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the minimum s / n that we consider ( in this case 7.0 ) , @xmath43 and @xmath44 the system noise temperature and the sky temperature in k respectively , @xmath45 the gain of the radio telescope ( in k / jy ) , @xmath46 the integration time in seconds , @xmath47 the number of polarizations and @xmath48 the bandwidth in mhz .",

    "the range of dms is the same used for plotting our results .",
    "we note that our sensitivity limits are significantly better ( from 3 to 10 times , depending also on the period ) than any previous result .    for those sources for which the pulse period is well known ( sax  j1808.4@xmath13658 ) or for which an indication of the pulse period exists ( aql  x@xmath11 and 1731@xmath1260 ) , we also plotted ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) the flux density limit as a function of the dm , at constant @xmath40 .",
    "the vertical dashed line indicates the nominal dm .",
    "the upper limits on the flux density ( for nominal dm and using either the known pulse period or a standard value @xmath62 ms ) are listed in the second column of table [ tab2 ] for 35 min long integrations .",

    "when the observations were analysed , we now discuss the effects of the orbital motion .    for a binary pulsar , the time of arrival of the pulses ( and in turn the observed pulse phase ) is affected by the orbital motion .",
    "this results in a broadening of the integrated pulse profile and hence in a sensitivity loss during a blind periodicity search . in this case , the effective pulse width can be written as : @xmath63 the extra term @xmath64 accounts for the pulse broadening introduced by the doppler effect due to the orbital motion : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the speed of light and @xmath67 is the line - of - sight component of the acceleration of the ns , supposed constant during the integration time @xmath68 as @xmath64 approaches the pulse period @xmath69 the pulsating signal is smeared , preventing the discovery of msps in strongly accelerated binary systems ( cf . johnston & kulkarni 1991 ; camilo et al .",
    "2000 ; jouteux et al .",
    "2002 ) .    for an assigned value of @xmath67",
    ", @xmath64 can be significantly decreased only reducing @xmath68 all the nss in our sample belong to binary systems : thus , in addition to the standard segments containing @xmath34 samples , we analysed also shorter time series of @xmath33 samples ( corresponding to @xmath70 min ) , implying a reduction of @xmath64 of at least a factor 16 . in figure [ fig3 ]",
    "we show the sensitivity loss due to the orbital motion for the case of an integration time of @xmath35 min .",
    "the solid line represents the sensitivity to an isolated pulsar , while long - dashed , short - dashed and dotted lines are for a pulsar in a binary system , subjected to a constant acceleration of 5 , 15 and 30 m s@xmath71 respectively .",
    "these values of @xmath67 span the range of the instantaneous accelerations along the line - of - sight that are experienced by the known millisecond pulsars detected in binary systems .",
    "however , each pulsar undergoes a change of the sign of the line - of - sight acceleration twice a orbit , namely at orbital phases 0.00 and 0.50 , when it is in quadrature with the companion star .",
    "if a segment of the observation brackets one of these phases and the integration time @xmath46 is a small fraction of the orbital period , the doppler effect does not significantly affect the detectability of the pulsar in that segment of data .",
    "whenever the total observing time covers at least half a orbit of a binary system , a good segment can always be selected .",
    "according to these considerations , we have listed in table [ tab2 ] , the minimum pulse period that our search could have detected for the ns ",
    "sxts whose orbital period is known . in particular , we have assumed that the minimum detectable period corresponds to @xmath72 , which is @xmath73 for a duty cycle of @xmath74 the value in the fourth column refers to the most favorable situation in which , during a @xmath70 min observation , the ns experiences the minimum line - of - sight acceleration along its ( assumed circular ) orbit ( i.e. when the ns centripetal acceleration is almost perpendicular to the line of sight ) . the probability that one of the segments in which we have split the observations just coincides with this favorable condition is listed in the fifth column .",
    "the value in the last column refers to the worst case , in which the ns apparent motion is almost perpendicular to the line of sight .    for sax j1808.4@xmath13658 , for which we know both the ( short ) orbital period and the pulse period , and for which our observations covered twice the entire orbit , we analysed segments containing only @xmath75 samples corresponding to 4.4 min .",
    "with this choice we are sure that there are at least four segments of the observation where the maximum acceleration along the line - of - sight is @xmath76 m s@xmath71 implying a negligible broadening of the pulse @xmath77 ms .    from table [ tab2 ]",
    "we see that , with a modest penalty in term of limiting flux density ( about a factor 2 ) , our search had a good probability of detecting a millisecond pulsar signal in these binary systems , at least where an indication of the orbital period is available .",
    "it is worth noting that the pulse periods in the sixth column are absolute upper limits : since a significant fraction of the orbit has been always covered by our observations , the line - of - sight acceleration in the best of our segments is certainly less than the maximum possible acceleration .",
    "moreover , if a millisecond pulsar is bright enough , its signal can appear in a portion of the subintegration array of the folded data even if it is badly smeared by the binary motion over the whole observation .",
    "such a feature would certainly have been recognised .",
    "although a full acceleration analysis might improve our detection limit , we have reached sensitivities significantly better than any similar previous search on these six targets , yet we have no detections .",
    "we see three possible expanations for this within the framework of the recycling model .",
    "these are examined in turn .",
    "a first interpretation is that the simple model presented in  [ sec : intro ] fails to predict when the radio emission mechanism switches on in a fast - rotating magnetized neutron star .",
    "in particular the condition of equation ( [ eq : radioemission ] ) could be necessary but not sufficient : maybe the conditions for establishment of coherent radio emission require a time longer than the typical time between two accretion phases . on this hypothesis , the class of the ns  sxts displaying the longest times of quiescence should be preferentially selected for the search of radio pulses .",
    "another possibility is that the mechanism of accretion contributes to the x - ray luminosity also during quiescence . in this case",
    ", the condition ( [ eq : radioemission ] ) is fulfilled if @xmath78^{7/2 } \\lsim   \\left[\\frac{r_m({outb})}{r_{lc}}\\right]^{7/2 } \\label{eq : radio_ok}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 @xmath80 @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the mass transfer rates toward the ns and the magnetospheric radii during the quiescence and during an x - ray outburst . when an approximate value of the spin rate of the ns is available , the rightmost term in equation ( [ eq : radio_ok ] ) can be estimated . on the contrary ,",
    "the leftmost term in equation ( [ eq : radio_ok ] ) is usually difficult to estimate because the efficiency @xmath83 of conversion of the accretion flow into observed x - ray luminosity depends on the regime at which the bulk of the accretion energy is released ( campana et al .",
    "actually , accretion directly onto the surface of a spinning , magnetized ns is centrifugally inhibited once the magnetospheric radius is outside the corotation radius @xmath84 at which the keplerian angular frequency of the orbiting matter equals the ns angular speed : @xmath85 the light cylinder is always outside the corotation radius , their ratio being @xmath86 for reasonable values of the parameters .",
    "when a ns settles in the so - called _ propeller _ stage ( i.e. @xmath87 ) , @xmath83 depends on uncertain factors ( illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ) and hence the observed reduction in the x - ray luminosity during the decline from an outburst can not unequivocally lead to the conclusion that equation ( [ eq : radioemission ] ) is satisfied .",
    "similar caveats hold if the inner part of the accretion disk is bloated , allowing some of the matter to overcome the centrifugal barrier , accreting onto the ns polar caps .",
    "even if a radio pulsar is active , its signal could be too weak for being detected at the distance of the earth and/or the radio beams could miss our line - of - sight . in this section",
    "we try to quantify the probability that such geometrical and luminosity factors prevent the detection of radio pulsations at 1.4 ghz from all our six targeted sources .",
    "the average value @xmath88 of the fraction of the sky swept by two conal radio beams of half - width @xmath89 is @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the angle ( supposed randomly distributed ) between the magnetic axis ( aligned with the radio beams ) and the rotational axis and @xmath92    -\\cos [ { min}(0,\\alpha+\\rho)]$ ] ( emmering & chevalier 1989 ) .    as a population",
    ", the msps display wider beams than the longer - period pulsars , but the measured opening angles do not follow the same @xmath93 scaling law of the normal pulsars ( kramer et al .  1998 ) . on the contrary ,",
    "they are spread over a large range of angles for similar values of @xmath40 . conservatively assuming the average value @xmath94 derived from profile widths measured at 10% intensity by kramer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , we get @xmath95 .",
    "hence , the probability that the radio beams of all the six targeted sources are missing our line - of - sight is @xmath96 .",
    "because of poor statistics and observational biases , the luminosity function of msps is difficult to assess .",
    "therefore , in figure [ fig4 ] we have plotted the distribution ( binned in logarithmic units ) of the _ pseudo - luminosity _ @xmath97 for 58 msps detected in the galactic disk and in globular clusters , where @xmath98 is the measured flux density in mjy at 1400 mhz and @xmath99 is the distance of the source , generally inferred from the dispersion measure , given a model for the distribution of the interstellar ionized matter ( taylor & cordes 1993 ) .",
    "when available , we have used the values of @xmath98 quoted in literature , otherwise we have scaled the 400 mhz flux densities using an average spectral index for the msps , @xmath100 ( kramer et al .",
    "1998 ) . comparing the obtained distribution with our sensitivity limits ( indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] with an arrow for each observed object ) we have roughly estimated for each source the probability that its _ pseudo - luminosity _ is too faint for detection in our experiment .",
    "these probabilities are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . combining these results with the beaming factor",
    ", there is a probability of @xmath101% that the pulsed emission from all the objects in our list would be unobservable at 1.4 ghz .",
    "this is not negligible , but can be reduced with deeper searches and/or a larger sample .",
    "it is well known that absorption ( see e.g. thompson et al .",
    "1994 for a review ) is a viable mechanism for explaining the absence of observable radio signals from a source surrounded by ionized gas : here we will investigate this hypothesis for the case of a radio pulsar in a ns  sxt .",
    "it has been recently suggested ( burderi et al .",
    "2001 ) that during their x - ray quiescent phase , most ns  sxts show the so - called _ radio  ejection _ phenomenon . during the transition from outburst to quiescence",
    ", the mass transfer rate suddenly drops from @xmath102 ( which determines the x - ray luminosity during the outburst ) to a value below @xmath103 , at which the condition ( [ eq : radioemission ] ) is satisfied and the ns becomes a source of relativistic particles and magneto - dipole emission .",
    "the released energy both _ ( i ) _ sweeps the environment of the neutron star , allowing coherent radio emission to be switched on ( shvartsman 1970 ) and _ ( ii ) _ expels the gas still leaving the companion star through the inner lagrangian point of the binary , thus preventing further accretion ( ruderman , shaham & tavani 1989 ) .    as pointed out by burderi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , a moderate resurgence of the mass transfer rate @xmath104 to a value just above @xmath105 is not sufficient to cause accretion to resume . to quench the radio pulsar , @xmath104",
    "must be restored to at least the outburst value @xmath106 .",
    "this means that , during the x - ray quiescent phase of a ns  sxt , the mass loss rate from the companion can be quite large ( almost equal to the mass transfer rate during the outburst , @xmath106 ) , but nevertheless the matter overflowing the roche lobe of the companion is swept away by the radiation pressure of the pulsar and leaves the system in the form of a wind .",
    "the possible occurrence of large values of @xmath107 during quiescence suggests that a surrounding wind may be responsible for absorption of the radio emission at any orbital phase .",
    "a hydrodynamical simulation of the flow of the plasma from the inner lagrangian point to the surroundings of the binary is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "here we are interested in an order - of - magnitude estimate , to verify that absorption of the radio signal by the ejected plasma can occur for reasonable values of ns  sxt parameters .",

    "should be a common phenomenon during the quiescent phase of most ns  sxts .    in particular , using the available values ( see table [ tab1 ] ) of @xmath164 @xmath7 and @xmath165 derived from x - ray and/or optical observations ( holding the other unknown parameters at the reference values ) , the inequalities ( [ eq : g_1 ] ) and ( [ eq : g_2 ] ) are satisfied for the sources in our list . hence , absorption in the gas engulfing the ns",
    "sxts during quiescence can explain the null result of our search at 1.4 ghz .    in this case ,",
    "the most favorable moment for detecting a radio pulsar in a sxt would be just at the beginning of the quiescent phase , immediately after the ignition of the radio pulsar emission .",
    "at this point , the rate of infall should be a minimum .",
    "later on , during the x - ray quiescent phase , the secondary star would resume a much higher rate of mass loss , not enough for restarting accretion on the ns surface , but enough to completely absorb the radio pulsar signal .      a pulsating signal from a pulsar",
    "can become undetectable not only due to absorption , but also if the pulse profile is broadened due to a variation of the dispersion measure during the observation .",
    "however , in the following we show that the dispersion smearing alone can hardly explain our results .    assuming as in  [ subsec :",
    "absorption ] a fully ionized spherically symmetric isothermal gas leaving the binary , the additional @xmath166 introduced by the local matter is @xmath167 where @xmath168 is the internal radius of the cavity that the pulsar energetic flux creates in the surrounding gas and @xmath169 is the external radius of this cavity , where the density of the gas @xmath89 becomes equal to the ism density @xmath170 g @xmath111 .    assuming a simple density profile @xmath171 and using the continuity equation for normalizing @xmath89 at its value at @xmath172 from integration of eq ( [ eq : g_3 ] ) it turns out : @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the orbital separation in light seconds and the other quantities as in  [ subsec : absorption ] .",
    "the right hand of eq ( [ eq : g_4 ] ) has been calculated neglecting the @xmath175 term , writing @xmath176 ( like already done in ",
    "[ subsec : absorption ] ) and assuming @xmath168 equal to the orbital separation . adopting @xmath177 and using the reference values of  [ subsec : absorption ] for the other parameters ,",
    "we derive @xmath178 on one hand , this estimate ensures that our search has not been limited by additional dispersion due to matter released by the targeted systems : at most one can expect that @xmath179 ( higher values would imply the occurrence of a new phase of accretion which would quench the pulsar radio emission , see previous section ) , and hence @xmath180 pc @xmath111 , well within the range of our searched values of dm .    on the other hand , eq ( [ eq : g_1 ] ) shows that a true absoprtion of the signal can be avoided only for @xmath181 hence for @xmath182 pc @xmath111 .",
    "given the total bandwidth of our observations , the latter inequalitie corresponds to a dispersive smearing of the pulse @xmath183 ms over the entire orbit .",
    "the segments of observations that we analysed , anyway , cover only a fraction of the total orbital period , lasting from @xmath184 to @xmath185 min .",
    "hence , the expected smearing produced on every segment is typically of the order : @xmath186 where @xmath187 is the segment lenght in hours .",
    "such values of @xmath187 ( in agreement with what we obtain using the @xmath188 formula from rasio et al .",
    "1991 ) are not an obstacle for detecting the pulsating signal . in summary ,",
    "the dispersion smearing can become a treath for recognizing the pulsating nature of the radio signal from our systems only for values of @xmath147 for which the signal is already strongly weakened by the free - free absorption .",
    "the role of the dispersion smearing could only be enhanced by the presence of strong time - variable clumping and inhomogeneities of the matter at all the orbital phases at which we have observed . in this unlikely case",
    ", observations in the continuum would be preferable .",
    "we have searched for millisecond pulsations at 1.4 ghz in six neutron - star soft x - ray transient sources during their phases of quiescence . despite the significant improvement of the sensitivity threshold compared to any similar previous experiment , no pulsed signal was detected .",
    "if coherent radio emission from the rapidly rotating magnetized neutron star occurs in these systems , the probability of having missed it due to its weakness or beaming is only about 25% .",
    "free - free absorption offers a viable alternative interpretation of our null result .",
    "we have shown that , during the quiescent phase , the companion to a ns  sxt can lose an amount of gas insufficient to quench the radio emission , but sufficient to completely absorb the radio signal .",
