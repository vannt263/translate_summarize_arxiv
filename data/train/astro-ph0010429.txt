    "the sub - parsec masing disk recently found to be orbiting a @xmath18 solar mass black hole in the seyfert 2 galaxy , ngc 4258 , provides the most compelling evidence to date for the existence of a massive black hole in the nucleus of a galaxy ( miyoshi  1995 ) .",
    "the disk is edge - on , the x - ray spectrum is heavily absorbed ( makishima  1995 ) and an active nucleus is visible in polarized light ( wilkes  1995 ) .",
    "nearly all agns which contain maser sources and have x - ray observations show strong x - ray absorption consistent with an edge - on disk , suggesting that they generally harbor active nuclei in their cores .",
    "this is consistent with the generally accepted scenario that many seyfert 2 galaxies are edge - on seyfert 1 galaxies ( antonucci & miller 1985 ) .",
    "the combined power of the high - resolution radio observations and the x - ray spectrum to study the structure of the disk both along the line - of - sight and in the plane of the sky makes these objects potentially key to our understanding of the inner regions of active galaxies .",
    "the seyfert 1.9/2 galaxy eso103-g35 is a strong x - ray source , originally discovered by heao 1/a2 ( h1834 - 653 , marshall  1979 , piccinotti  1982 ) .",
    "it was identified as a seyfert 1.9 galaxy at a redshift of 0.0133 by phillips  ( 1979 ) though later spectra have shown no evidence for broad lines ( morris & ward 1988 ) leaving its classification in some doubt .",
    "it has been observed extensively in the x - rays .",
    "exosat observations revealed strong , soft x - ray absorption ( @xmath19 @xmath20 ) which showed a factor of 2 variation over 90 days ( warwick , pounds & turner 1988 ) , providing some of the first evidence for variable absorption in a seyfert nucleus .",
    "_ ginga _ observations revealed an equivalent width @xmath21 ev fe k@xmath9 emission line whose origin was not clear given the presumed ( but not confirmed ) presence of a flaring source within the _ ginga _ beam during a portion of this observation ( warwick  1993 ) .",
    "the continuum spectrum was consistent with that reported by exosat .",
    "asca observations confirmed and extended the earlier studies , reporting a cold , resolved fe k@xmath9 emission line and a mildly ionized fe k - edge ( turner  1997 , forster , leighly & kay 1999 ) . while flux variations up to a factor of a few are common on short timescales , no significant spectral or absorption variations have been detected .",
    "recent radio measurements have revealed water maser emission in the form of a single line at @xmath22 km s@xmath8 ( braatz , wilson & henkel 1997 ) with respect to the agn redshift . due to the large negative declination ( @xmath23 ) of this source , higher resolution and sensitivity observations to further study",
    "this maser are difficult at present .",
    "however the combination of water maser emission and the strong , absorbed x - ray source suggest a strong parallel with ngc4258 and motivated our observations with bepposax to obtain an x - ray spectrum simultaneously over a wide energy band ( 1200 kev ) .",
    "the moderate spatial resolution ( @xmath24 ) of bepposax facilitates identification of any nearby , contaminating sources and so avoids the confusion present in the _ ginga _ data . here",
    "we present an analysis of the bepposax x - ray data .",
    "eso103-g35 was observed with bepposax at two epochs : oct 1996 and oct 1997 ( see table  [ tbobs ] ) .",
    "data were obtained with both gas scintillator proportional counter ( gspc ) detectors : low and medium energy concentrator spectrometers ( lecs and mecs respectively , parmar 1990 ) and with the phoswich detector system ( pds , frontera 1991 ) .",
    "the source was clearly detected and unresolved in all three detectors and no nearby source of comparable strength was seen .",
    "counts were extracted from a @xmath25 circle in both lecs and mecs detectors and background counts subtracted , estimated from the background file appropriate for this extraction radius provided by the bepposax data center ( sdc ) as of march 1998 .",
    "the resulting net source count rates for the energy ranges over which the instrument calibration is reliable are listed in table  [ tbobs ] .",
    "the pds data were background subtracted as part of the data reduction pipeline .",

    "this model shows a resolved fe k@xmath9 emission line at 6.3@xmath10.1 kev and equivalent width 290@xmath10 ev .",
    "figure  [ fgflux ] shows the lack of significant variation in spectral parameters over a 13 year period .    in the hard x - ray , where the effects of the large absorbing column are negligible",
    ", the scenario of seyfert 2 galaxies being edge - on seyfert 1s predicts that both classes of galaxy look similar .",
    "hard x - ray and @xmath30-ray data for radio - quiet seyfert 1 galaxies typically show a power law spectrum with spectral index , @xmath31 , similar to that reported here for eso103-g35 but extending to energies @xmath32 kev ( gondek  1996 ) rather than @xmath33 kev .",
    "this hard x - ray spectrum can be explained by emission from an optically thin , relativistic , thermal plasma in a disk corona or by a non - thermal plasma with a power - law injection of relativistic electrons ( gondek  1996 ) .",
    "the lower high energy cutoff suggests this component has a higher optical depth in eso103-g35 .",
    "in addition the x - ray spectra of radio - quiet seyfert 1 galaxies typically include a contribution from compton reflection in warm material which is superposed on the underlying power law in the energy range 10100 kev ( gondek  1996 ) .",
    "the 1996 observation favors a cutoff power law over a reflection model suggesting that this latter component is , at most , weak in eso103-g35 in its brighter state .",
    "however the relatively strong hard flux in the otherwise lower luminosity 1997 dataset suggests the presence of a reflection component in 1997 . since the reflection model includes a large number of parameters , it is not possible to constrain them usefully .",
    "however if we assume an isotropic source situated above the accretion disk , no high energy cutoff and solar abundances we deduce an inclination angle for the disk in the range @xmath34 , consistent with eso103-g35 being a sy1.9/2 in unified models and with the accurately edge - on geometry implied by the presence of water maser emission .",
    "figure  [ fgflux ] shows the historical light curve of eso103-g35 since 1983 including the current bepposax observations ( 1997 ) .",
    "it is clear that flux variations of factors of a few are common on timescales of months .",
    "the variation seen by asca and bepposax between 1994 and 1997 shows a slow rise and rapid fall quite similar to that seen by _ ginga _ between 1983 and 1985 .",
    "the flux level in the 1996 observation ( f(210 kev ) = 2.57@xmath10.07@xmath35 erg @xmath5 s@xmath8 ) indicates a luminosity , l@xmath36 erg s@xmath8 ( h@xmath37=50 , q@xmath37=0 ) .",
    "the emission line is cold ( 6.3@xmath10.1 kev ) , but consistent with being mildly warm , and marginally resolved ( table  [ tbres ] ) .",
    "adopting an mecs instrument energy resolution of ( @xmath6 ) 0.21 kev at 6.3 kev ( sax observers handbook ) , the intrinsic width of the line is estimated to be 0.28@xmath10.12 kev which yields a fwhm of @xmath38 km s@xmath8 for the fe k@xmath9 line .",
    "this indicates an origin in neutral , high - velocity material .",
    "the ew , 290@xmath10 ev , is within the wide range of observed values for seyfert 2 galaxies and is consistent with fluorescence in the cold absorber , the accretion disk / torus , which is attenuating the observed x - ray continuum ( awaki  1991 , turner  1997 ) .",
    "the emission line in the second dataset is not well - constrained .",
    "it is consistent with constant flux or with constant equivalent width over the one year period so we can not determine if any response to the continuum variation has occurred . from the @xmath39 kev ( table  [ tbres ] ) , the fwhm of the line is about 30,000 km s@xmath8 .    if the line width is dynamic , indicating a virial velocity around the 10@xmath40 m@xmath41 black hole , then the radial distance to the emitter is about 0.01 pc .",
    "we note that an alternative interpretation of the broad fe k-@xmath9 line is that of a mix of neutral and ionized material",
    ". this would be consistent with the earlier suggestion (  3.1 ) of ionized material in the inner regions of the accretion disk / torus being responsible for the ionized fe - k edge .",
    "fits to the 1994 asca dataset with three narrow lines covering a range of ionization were statistically indistinguishable from those with a broadened , neutral line ( turner  1997 ) .",
    "bepposax , with its high energy response , has provided information on the high energy spectrum of a number of agn for the first time .",
    "the dispersion and errors in the observed values of high energy cutoff of agn are high but values typically range from 100@xmath42400 kev ( matt 1998 ) .",
    "the high energy spectrum of agn is a critical parameter for matching both the turnover at @xmath33 kev and the high energy source counts when modelling the cxrb .",
    "successful models generally adopt a value of 300 kev and require strong evolution in the number of absorbed agn with redshift ( gilli , risaliti & salvati 1999 ) .",
    "however , the high energy cutoff determined from our bepposax data for eso103-g35 ( 29@xmath110 kev ) is significantly lower , calling into question the validity of the modelling to date .",
    "more realistic modelling of the distribution of agn spectral properties , including the high energy cutoff , is required to make an accurate assessment of the agn contribution to the cxrb ( yaqoob 2000 ) .",
    "eso103-g35 is an x - ray bright , sy 1.9/2.0 galaxy containing one of strongest water maser sources known implying that it is viewed accurately edge - on .",
    "the presence of cold molecular material along the line of sight to the active nucleus supports this picture .",
    "the amount of x - ray absorption has been @xmath16constant over the past 15 years and , at @xmath43 @xmath5 , it is typical of seyfert 2 galaxies and consistent with a line - of - sight passing through the edge - on accretion disk / torus also responsible for the maser emission .",
    "we observe a marginally resolved fe - k@xmath9 emission line whose width , if dynamic , implies a radial distance to the absorber of about 0.01 pc , similar to that expected for an obscuring torus . alternatively",
    ", the width may be due to a range of ionization states in the emitting material consistent with the ionized fe k edge at 7.37@xmath11 kev .",
    "the fe k@xmath9 line strength ( ew=290@xmath10 ev ) and width are consistent with origin in an accretion disk / torus through which our line - of - sight is passing .",
    "the presence of both cold and warm ( ionized ) absorbing ( and emitting ) material suggests that the inner parts of the torus / disk are mildly ionized while the outer parts are cold .    the flux level in the energy range 0.6@xmath4210 kev decreased by a factor @xmath14 between october 1996 and october 1997 with no evidence for a change in spectral shape or absorption .",
    "however the 10 - 50 kev flux did not change between the two observations suggesting either a hardening of the hard continuum or the presence of a reflection component ( undetectable at the higher flux level ) which reacts to continuum changes with some delay . given the paucity of datapoints , we are unable to place meaningful constraints on the distance of the reflecting material from the continuum source .",
    "the 1996 dataset shows a high energy cutoff at @xmath44 kev .",
    "this is significantly lower than the values @xmath17 kev believed typical to date ( gondek  1996 , matt 1998 ) . the high energy spectrum of agn is critical for modelling the agn contribution to the cxrb so that this result emphasizes the need to include a realistic distribution of cutoff energy in these models .",
