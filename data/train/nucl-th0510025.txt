    "the properties of baryon resonances have largely been obtained from fits to @xmath0 elastic scattering and photoproduction data .",
    "these fits have covered the range from simple isobar models to more complex analyses involving dispersion - relation constraints .",
    "results have varied widely , particularly for resonances immersed in large backgrounds and coupled only weakly to the initial or final states .    with the availability of high quality data involving final states such as @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , there have been attempts to fit all connected reactions simultaneously , using unitarity as a constraint .",
    "other groups have concentrated on single - channel fits to data from reactions such as the electro- and photoproduction of etas and kaons .",
    "the resulting collections of masses , widths and branching fractions differ significantly in many cases , which has led to debates over the relative importance of particular constraints and approximations .    in the following ,",
    "we examine the constraints imposed by unitarity on single - channel fits to data using a k - matrix formalism .",
    "pion photoproduction will be illustrated in detail , though our results are easily generalized to other reactions . in pion photoproduction",
    ", the constraint imposed by watson s theorem  @xcite has been widely used to study the @xmath4 resonance region . for energies above the two - pion production threshold",
    ", however , this constraint no longer applies . in an earlier work  @xcite",
    ", we outlined a way to extend watson s theorem beyond the two - pion production threshold , assuming the dominance of a single additional @xmath5 channel .",
    "this has been used in a number of subsequent fits to pion photoproduction data . in the next section",
    ", we recall how the form was derived and show how it reduces to watson s theorem for an elastic @xmath0 scattering amplitude .",
    "we then extend this method to account for an arbitrary number of hadronic channels .",
    "it is hoped that this collection of results will allow a more direct comparison between single - channel fits to data and multi - channel analyses based on the k - matrix formalism .",
    "the simplest application of a k - matrix constraint to the two - channel process is watson s theorem , which involves just the channels @xmath0 and @xmath6 , showing that below the two - pion production threshold , pion photoproduction amplitudes carry the phase of the associated @xmath0 amplitude . in ref .",
    "@xcite this argument was extended to include two hadronic channels .",
    "the second hadronic channel was labeled @xmath5 but was intended to account for all inelasticity in the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "the @xmath7 hadronic k- and t - matrices , in this case , were written as @xmath8 and @xmath9 with the abbreviations @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "inverting the @xmath7 hadronic matrix @xmath13 and multiplying by @xmath14 , we obtain expressions for the t - matrix elements .",
    "the t - matrix element @xmath15 can be expressed , in terms of a function @xmath16 , as @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 the last expression obtains a factor of @xmath20 through the use of eq.(3 ) .",
    "expanding to a @xmath21 matrix , including the photon interaction channels , we have @xmath22 rewriting the relation @xmath23 for this enlarged k - matrix in the form @xmath24 yields a set of relations between the t- and k - matrix elements , a particularly useful one being , @xmath25 using the above relation for @xmath26 and keeping terms of first order in the electromagnetic coupling ( dropping @xmath27 ) we have @xmath28 writing this in terms of @xmath16 and using @xmath29 , the final result is @xmath30    had we proceeded with only @xmath6 and @xmath0 channels , we would have arrived at the simpler expression @xmath31 which , since @xmath15 is now elastic , leads directly to watson s theorem",
    ". for real k - matrix elements , eq.(9 ) has a phase behavior related to @xmath15 and provides a smooth connection of watson s theorem to energies above the two - pion production threshold .",
    "the extension to a third hadronic channel , such as @xmath1 , can be handled using the method described above .",
    "writing @xmath32 for a 3-channel k - matrix , involving the elements @xmath0 , @xmath5 and @xmath1 , again yields useful relations . in order to arrive at an expression similar to eq.(9 ) , we retain combinations containing @xmath15 @xmath33 and @xmath34 with @xmath35 the @xmath0 t - matrix element can again be represented in terms of a function @xmath16 , as in eq.(3 ) , with @xmath36    substituting these relations into @xmath37 dropping the @xmath27 term and regrouping , we have @xmath38 with @xmath39 and @xmath40 since @xmath41 , we can add and subtract @xmath42 and use @xmath29 to obtain @xmath43 the extension to further hadronic channels is then obvious .",
    "each new channel @xmath44 adds a term of the form @xmath45    .5 cm",
    "it is instructive to examine these results at the k - matrix pole position . taking the simplest representation involving a single pole @xmath46 in the relation @xmath47 , one obtains @xmath48 } } \\ ] ] of the two resulting terms ,",
    "one is clearly ` resonant ' at @xmath49 = @xmath50 while the other goes to zero at this energy ( the ` background ' term ) .",
    "both have the phase of the ( elastic ) @xmath0 t - matrix .",
    "this nice correspondence disappears when a second hadronic channel is added . with the addition of a @xmath5 channel , @xmath51",
    "no longer goes to zero at @xmath49 = @xmath50 , and the expression in eq.(22 ) becomes divergent . assuming a pole exists in @xmath52 , both terms giving @xmath53 in eq.(7 ) diverge , though the sum remains finite . in our eq.(19 ) , however , these divergences do not occur .",
    "the bracketed terms remain finite at the k - matrix pole , assuming the residues are factorizable .    in the simple case ( watson s theorem ) involving only the @xmath6 and @xmath0 channels , there would have been no resonance term without a pole in the k - matrix element @xmath54 . however , in eq.(9 ) and its generalization , eq.(19 ) , the pole structures in all k - matrix elements multiplying the hadronic t - matrices cancel by construction .",
    "the resonancelike behavior of @xmath53 , in this case , results from the structure of the hadronic t - matrices .",
    "it is amusing to consider a case without explicit k - matrix poles which results in resonancelike behavior .",
    "this is most easily seen from eq.(4 ) , which is in fact the reduced k - matrix ( element ) of the full k - matrix involving @xmath0 and @xmath5 channels .",
    "as is well known  @xcite , the reduced k - matrix can ( in principle ) develop a pole , due to a zero in the denominator of the second term in eq.(4 ) , without an explicit pole in @xmath55 .",
    "this would typically occur just below the threshold for @xmath5 production , where momentum factors implicit in @xmath56 become complex .",
    "however , expressions of the form @xmath57 remain finite through the cancellation of poles at the resonance position",
    ". the behavior of such terms would be completely different if some of the elements were pole free .",
    "however , if none of the k - matrix elements contained poles , the result could be similar to one due to pole cancellation .",
    "we have shown how the functional forms used in fitting single - channel photoproduction data are related to the k - matrix elements of a multi - channel analysis . in the @xmath4 resonance region ,",
    "watson s theorem provides a strong constraint on the fit .",
    "if only two hadronic channels dominate , a form involving only the @xmath0 t - matrix is also possible . beyond this point",
    ", terms proportional to other hadronic t - matrices appear to be necessary .",
    "it is useful to compare two single - channel forms that have been used extensively in fitting pion photoproduction data . in the original",
    "said  @xcite analysis , data were fitted using the relation @xmath58 wherein the ` born ' term included vector meson exchanges and the terms @xmath59 and @xmath60 were phenomenological .",
    "this corresponds to eq.(9 ) , with @xmath59 and @xmath60 representing the ratios of k - matrix elements . in the original maid",
    "fits  @xcite a simpler parametrization @xmath61 was used .",
    "this form explicitly separates resonance and background pieces , the resonance part taken to be a breit - wigner function .",
    "the parameter @xmath62 is included to ensure that the overall phases of @xmath53 and @xmath15 are equal at energies where watson s theorem is valid .",
    "differences between eqs.(24 ) and ( 25 ) are minimized near resonances that have small backgrounds , a clear breit - wigner behavior , and a large coupling to the @xmath0 channel .",
    "for a nearly elastic resonance , the term @xmath51 becomes small and masks the effect of the additional term @xmath59 in eq.(24 ) .",
    "it should be noted , however , that many established resonances have @xmath0 branching fractions of only 10 - 30% . in an unbiased fit",
    ", the term @xmath59 can become quite large , resulting in a ` background ' very different from the first term in eq.(25 ) .",
    "an example of this effect will be given below .    in order to make contact with multi - channel fits ,",
    "comparisons should be made in cases where the dominance of two hadronic channels is a good approximation . here",
    "the quantity @xmath59 , found from fits to single - channel data , could be directly compared to calculated ratios of k - matrix elements .",
    "one problem with this approach is the reliable determination of @xmath54 .",
    "missing pieces in @xmath54 could be compensated for in the phenomenological term .",
    "a consistent comparison would require the same form of @xmath54 to be used in both the single- and multi - channel analyses .",
    "finally , we mention a reaction , other than pion photoproduction , where the dominance of two hadronic channels is a viable approximation . rewriting eq.(9 ) for eta photoproduction in the n(1535 ) channel , we have @xmath63 assuming the dominance of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "early single - channel fits assumed eta photoproduction was resonance dominated with negligible background .",
    "the argument for this was based on the size of born contributions involving a very small @xmath64 coupling constant .",
    "however , while small born terms may justify the neglect of @xmath65 , this argument does not exclude the second term multiplying @xmath66 .",
    "this gives a qualitative way to understand the different results of resonance - only single - channel fits  @xcite and multichannel analyses  @xcite .",
    "in fig .  1 , we compare a born - term approximation to the sum of born term and phenomenological contributions multiplying @xmath67 in eq .",
    "the phenomenological term is parameterized as a polynomial in energy , constrained to have the proper threshold behavior .",
    "figure 1(a ) shows the multipole @xmath68 connected to the roper resonance , which couples largely to @xmath0 and @xmath5 .",
    "figure 1(b ) gives the magnetic multipole connected to the @xmath69 @xmath0 resonance .",
    "this state couples largely to @xmath0 and @xmath5 , but also has a substantial @xmath70 coupling . in an unbiased fit to data ,",
    "the factors multiplying @xmath67 rapidly depart from a simple born term approximation .",
    "the use of born terms with point - like couplings is known to be problematic both at threshold ( where chiral perturbation theory is applicable ) and at higher energies ( where form factors are often applied ) . with this in mind , the departure from a born approximation to @xmath54 should not be surprising . notice that the sum of born and phenomenological pieces changes sign near the resonance position in these two multipoles .",
    "this behavior is more likely due to the phenomenological term than a modification of the born approximation . while the pole terms multiplying hadronic t - matrices in eq .",
    "( 9 ) cancel at @xmath50 , non - pole cross terms retain a dependence on @xmath71",
    ". these terms could account for a sign change near the resonance energy .",
    "not all multipoles show this cross - over behavior .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath72 within a multi - channel model could help to clarify this issue .",
    "it should be emphasized that the phenomenological terms used to generate the curves in fig .",
    "1 contain no explicit dependence on @xmath50 .",
