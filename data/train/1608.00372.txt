    "following the cosmic recombination , there were no luminous objects .",
    "this epoch is often called the ` dark ages ( da ) ' .",
    "the da ended with the formation of the first luminous objects because these objects illuminated the universe and this epoch is called the ` cosmic dawn ( cd ) ' . according to the standard hierarchical structure formation model based on lambda cdm ( @xmath0 ) cosmology , massive objects such as galaxies formed after the formation of smaller objects .",
    "these first generation objects played an important role in both thermal and ionization histories of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) @xcite .",
    "as structure formation proceeded , ionizing photons emitted by galaxies resulted in the ionization of the igm .",
    "this transition in the state of hydrogen in the igm is known as cosmic reionization .",
    "the epoch when cosmic reioization occurred everywhere in the universe is called ` epoch of reionization ' .",
    "several recent observations have provided us with useful information on the eor .",
    "for example , high-@xmath1 qso absorption lines imprinted in their spectra indicate that reionization concluded by @xmath2(e.g .",
    "@xcite ) , and the rapid evolution of the ly-@xmath3 luminosity function with redshift constrains the neutral hydrogen fraction at @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the optical depth of thomson scattering has been measured and the value obtained by planck is @xmath5 @xcite . the redshifted 21 cm line signal , which is the emission due to the hyperfine structure in a neutral hydrogen atom , is expected to be a promising tool to directly investigate matter density fluctuations , the ionization state and the spin temperature at the eor @xcite .",
    "although the cosmological 21 cm signal has not been observed yet , improvements in current instruments and foreground removal methods will push observational 21 cm cosmology into a new era in the near future .",
    "in addition , on - going projects such as mwa @xcite , lofar @xcite and paper @xcite have the potential to statistically detect the 21 cm signal .",
    "furthermore , a future instrument , ska , should be able to detect the 21 cm power spectrum at higher redshifts beyond the eor and to map the brightness temperature @xcite .",
    "one of the fundamental statistical values of the 21 cm signal is the 21 cm power spectrum .",
    "if the 21 cm signal follows a gaussian distribution , we can extract all of the statistical information from the power spectrum alone .",
    "however , we expect the 21 cm signal to have non - gaussian features in its distribution due to astrophysical effects , such as x - ray heating and reionization @xcite . in order to estimate the non - gaussian features of the 21 cm signal , various statistical quantities",
    "have been suggested such as the bispectrum , one - point statistics , and minkowski functionals @xcite . in our previous works",
    ", we examined the properties of the 21 cm bispectrum and its detectability @xcite .",
    "yoshiura et al , calculated the sensitivity of the 21 cm bispectrum by estimating the contribution from the thermal noise .",
    "they showed that the 21 cm bispectrum at the eor could be detected by mwa and lofar at large scales @xmath6 and at @xmath7 with ska @xcite .",
    "as observational techniques are further developed , we expect to obtain much more information on the eor from combinations of the 21 cm power spectrum and the bispectrum . it is imperative to estimate the parameters of eor models if we succeed in detecting the cosmic 21 cm signal .",
    "several previous works have performed forecasts for the eor parameters by using the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method or a fisher forecast applied to the 21 cm power spectrum or the global 21 cm signal @xcite .",
    "in addition , in a previous study , kubota et al . performed a fisher analysis on the variance and skewness of the brightness temperature @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a forecast of the parameter constraints by using a fisher analysis of on - going observations of the 21 cm signal .",
    "we focus on mwa and lofar as current observations .",
    "a previous work performed a fisher analysis on the 21 cm power spectrum to constrain the eor model parameters with mwa and lofar as supposed telescopes @xcite and obtained 1 @xmath8 errors of @xmath9 for the fiducial value of the eor model parameters . in our work",
    ", we estimate how these constraints on the eor parameters can be improved by including the 21 cm bispectrum . in this paper",
    ", we employ the best fit values of the standard cosmological parameters obtained in @xcite .",
    "a fundamental quantity of the 21 cm signal is the brightness temperature , which is described as the spin temperature offset from the cmb temperature given by ( see , e.g , @xcite ) @xmath10 .",
    "\\label{eq : brightness}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively represent the gas spin temperature and the cmb temperature , @xmath13 is the optical depth in the 21 cm rest frame frequency @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the neutral fraction of the hydrogen gas , @xmath16 is the evolved matter overdensity , @xmath17 is the hubble parameter and @xmath18 is the comoving gradient of the gas velocity along the line of sight .",
    "all quantities are evaluated at a redshift of @xmath19 .",
    "let us focus on the spatial distribution of the brightness temperature .",
    "the spatial fluctuation of the brightness temperature can be defined as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the mean brightness temperature obtained from the brightness temperature map and @xmath22 expresses the ensemble average . from this definition",
    ", we have the power spectrum of @xmath23 defined as @xmath24 if the statistics of the brightness temperature fluctuations is a pure gaussian , the statistical information of the brightness temperature should be completely characterized by the power spectrum .",
    "the statistics of the brightness temperature fluctuations completely follows that of the density fluctuations @xmath25 if both of the spin temperature and the neutral fraction are completely homogeneous .",
    "however , in the cd and eor eras , the spin temperature and the neutral fraction were spatially inhomogeneous and the statistics of the spatial fluctuations of those quantities would be highly non - gaussian due to the various astrophysical effects .",
    "accordingly , the statistics of the brightness temperature fluctuations would deviate from the pure gaussian and it will be important to investigate the non - gaussian features of the brightness temperature fluctuations .",
    "although such a non - gaussian feature can be investigated through the skewness of the one - point distribution functions as done in one of the our previous works @xcite , the scale - dependent feature is integrated out in the skewness .",
    "conversely , the higher order correlation functions in fourier space such as the bispectrum and the trispectrum characterize the non - gaussian features and contain the scale - dependent information . here",
    ", in order to determine the non - gaussian features of the brightness temperature fluctuations @xmath23 , we focus on the bispectrum of @xmath23 which is given by @xmath26 in order to calculate the bispectrum , we need to characterize the shape of the bispectrum in @xmath27-space . in this work , we choose the equilateral type bispectrum ( @xmath28 ) because the equilateral type of bispectrum normalized by wavenumber shows a stronger signal than other configurations [ see @xcite ] .",
    "we calculate the bispectrum of the brightness temperature fluctuations by making use of 21cmfast @xcite .",
    "this code is based on a semi - numerical model of reionization and the thermal history of the igm , and generates maps of matter density , velocity , spin temperature , ionized fraction and brightness temperature at the designated redshifts .",
    "we perform simulations in a @xmath29 comoving box with @xmath30 grids , which corresponds to 0.66 comoving mpc resolution or @xmath31 14.1 arcsec and a @xmath32 field of view at 127 mhz ( @xmath33 = 10 ) , from @xmath34 to @xmath35 adopting the following parameter set , @xmath36 . here",
    ", @xmath37 is the ionizing efficiency , @xmath38 is the number of x - ray photons emitted by the source per solar mass , @xmath39 is the minimum virial temperature of halos which produce ionizing photons , and @xmath40 is the mean free path of ionizing photons through the igm . in our calculation , for simplicity , we ignore , the gradient of peculiar velocity whose contribution to the brightness temperature is relatively small ( a few % ) @xcite .",
    "we study the parameter dependence of the 21  cm bispectrum in order to prepare for the fisher forecast .",
    "we choose three key parameters as the eor model parameters .",
    "we briefly summarize the key parameters below : + 1 .",
    "@xmath37 , _ the ionizing _ _ efficiency _ : @xmath37 is composed of a number of parameters related to ionizing photons escaping from high redshift galaxies and given as @xmath41 @xcite . here , @xmath42 is the fraction of ionizing photons escaping from galaxies into the igm , @xmath43 is the fraction converted from baryons to stars , @xmath44 is the number of ionizing photons per baryon in stars and @xmath45 is the recombination rate per baryon . in our calculation , we adopt @xmath46 as the fiducial value to satisfy observed constraints on the ionization history .",
    "@xmath47 , _ the minimum _ _ virial _ _ temperature _ _ of _ _ halos _ _ producing _ _ ionizing _ _ photons _ : @xmath47 parameterizes the minimum mass of halos producing ionizing photons at the eor .",
    "typically , @xmath39 is chosen to be @xmath48 corresponding to the temperature above which atomic cooling becomes effective .",
    "@xmath39 includes the physics of high redshift galaxy formation .",
    "if there is no radiative feedback , atomic cooling is thought to become effective at @xmath39=@xmath49 .",
    "hydrogen molecule cooling becomes effective below this temperature .",
    "if stars , or star forming galaxies , begin to form in a halo and radiative feedback by such objects exists , the minimum virial temperature is expected to become higher since radiative feedback , such as the photodissociation of @xmath50 , prevents the gas from cooling @xcite .",
    "conversely , positive feedback , such as the enhancement of @xmath50 molecules due to the increase of electrons , pushes the minimum virial temperature to lower values because cooling becomes more effective .",
    "we parameterize @xmath39 as a responsible parameter for uncertainties in the radiative feedback effects discussed above .",
    "@xmath40 , _ the maximum mean free path of ionizing photons _ : this parameter determines the maximum hii bubble size .",
    "physically , the mean free path of the ionizing photons is determined by the number density and the optical depth of lyman - limit systems . in our calculation",
    ", we choose @xmath40=30[comoving mpc ] as the fiducial value . + we show the parameter dependence of the ionization history in fig .",
    "[ fig : ionization ] .",
    "we adopt @xmath37=15 , 20 and 25 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 and @xmath40=15 mpc , 30 mpc and 60 mpc .",
    "fig.[fig : ionization ] shows that larger @xmath37 and smaller @xmath39 cause earlier reionization .",
    "larger @xmath37 means that much more photons can contribute to the ionization of the neutral hydrogen gas .",
    "this leads to the progression of the eor . since lower @xmath47 corresponds to a smaller halo mass , the formation epoch of halos capable of producing ionizing photons shifts to earlier times",
    "this is because larger @xmath37 and smaller @xmath39 cause earlier reionization .",
    "furthermore , larger @xmath40 causes efficient reionization because the large mean free path of the ionizing photons can create large ionized bubbles .",
    "however , the ionization history does not depend on @xmath40 at higher redshifts when reionization did not progress efficiently .",
    "this is because @xmath40 affects the epoch after the ionized bubbles have grown to some extent . in fig.[fig : bs_params1 ] , we show the scale dependence of the bispectrum at each redshift for various @xmath37 , @xmath39 and @xmath53 . in the first column of this figure",
    ", we can see that larger @xmath37 suppresses the bispectrum as the redshift decreases .",
    "this is because higher @xmath37 drives the reionization to earlier times and the neutral fraction becomes smaller overall . in the second column",
    ", we can see that the power of the bispectrum is suppressed in the case of smaller @xmath39 , especially at larger scales .",
    "smaller @xmath39 can easily form large numbers of haloes which are capable of producing ionizing photons .",
    "these haloes produce large numbers of ionized bubbles .",
    "therefore , these large numbers of ionized bubbles grow as reionization proceeds and then the 21 cm signal coming from these bubbles becomes small . therefore , the power of the bispectrum corresponding to the bubble size is suppressed .",
    "therefore the power of the bispectrum is suppressed at larger scales at @xmath54 with small @xmath39 .",
    "conversely , the effect of @xmath40 becomes remarkable at @xmath54 although there are slight differences between different the values of @xmath53 at @xmath1=8 and 9 . as we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : ionization ] , the effect of @xmath40 appears in the epoch after the neutral hydrogen fraction decreases to less than @xmath55 ( lower redshift ) .",
    "therefore , the effect of @xmath40 on the bispectrum is also slight at @xmath1=9 and 8 and appears at @xmath54 .",
    "in order to forecast constraints on the eor model parameters , we use the fisher information matrix @xmath56 . given the observational data , the maximum likelihood analysis gives a set of parameters which maximize the likelihood function @xmath57 ( the probability distribution function for the measured data set as a function of the model parameters ) .",
    "the fisher formalism assumes that the likelihood function @xmath57 is a multi - dimensional gaussian of the given parameters . using the fisher analysis @xcite",
    ", we can estimate the expected constraints on the model parameters with the supposed instruments .",
    "the fisher matrices for the 21  cm power spectrum and the 21  cm bispectrum are respectively given by    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the model parameter vector , @xmath60 and @xmath61 is a set of fiducial model parameters , @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath63 expresses the @xmath63-th bin of the wavenumber .",
    "@xmath64 are thermal noise of the power spectrum and the bispectrum , respectively .",
    "note that we need to take the error covariance into account to make precise evaluations of the fisher matrix .",
    "however , previous work shows that the correlation between different modes is weak at large scales ( @xmath65 ) in the power spectrum@xcite .",
    "therefore we assume that the correlation between the different scales is negligible in our study because we are focusing on the relatively large scales accessible by the mwa and lofar ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "likewise , we also assume that the error covariance of the bispectrum is small .",
    "as we show later , the dominant contribution the fisher matrix comes from larger scales where the error covariance is small .",
    "therefore , we can justify neglecting the effect of the error covariance at larger scales . given the fisher matrix",
    ", we can estimate the expected 1-@xmath8 error of the @xmath67-@xmath68 parameter :    @xmath69        next , we estimate the thermal noises of the power spectrum and bispectrum .",
    "as opposed to the power spectrum of thermal noise , the ensemble average of the bispectrum of the thermal noise is actually zero if the thermal noise follows a gaussian distribution .",
    "however , the variance of the thermal noise bispectrum is non zero and this variance contributes to the 21 cm bispectrum signal .",
    "the thermal noise due to the variance of the 21 cm bispectrum was derived by @xcite .",
    "we use the formula for the power spectrum of the thermal noise and the variance of the thermal noise bispectrum shown in eqs.[eq : dpk ] , [ eq : dbk ] respectively , which were derived by @xcite .",

    "the other quantities are the wavenumber @xmath73 , the system temperature @xmath74 , the effective area @xmath75 , the bandwidth @xmath76 , the integral time @xmath77 and the number density of the baselines @xmath78 .",
    "@xmath79 and @xmath80 , which are determined by the assumed cosmology , are the quantities which convert @xmath81 space to fourier space @xmath82 .",
    "other quantities ( @xmath83 ) are angles in fourier space , which are required to calculate the spherically averaged noise power spectrum and the variance of the thermal noise bispectrum .",
    "please refer to @xcite for a detail explanation . here",
    ", we use the telescope parameters listed in table 1 of @xcite ( although they assume a mwa with 512 tiles ( mwa-512 t ) , we assume a mwa with 256 tiles ( mwa-256 t ) .",
    "thus , we reduce the number of antennae by half in this work ) .        in figs.[fig :",
    "sn_ps ] and [ fig : sn_bs ] , we show the scale dependence of the power spectrum and the bispectrum , respectively , with thermal noise estimated for mwa and lofar .",
    "we assumed a total observation time of 1000 hours .",
    "note that we multiply the square ( cube ) of the average brightness temperature for the power spectrum ( bispectrum ) . from figs.[fig : sn_ps ] and [ fig : sn_bs ] , we can see that the noise increases at smaller scales in both bispectrum and power spectrum .",
    "this is because the number of longer baselines corresponding to smaller scales is deficient .",
    "conversely , the sensitivity at large scales is limited by the field of view .    for both bispectrum and power spectrum noises , we can not calculate the sensitivity at @xmath84 for the lofar telescope .",
    "since we set the antenna size as the minimum baseline length , we can not calculate larger scales corresponding to the minimum baseline length . comparing the sensitivity of the power spectrum with that for the bispectrum ,",
    "the signal to noise ratio in the case of the power spectrum is slightly larger than that in the case of the bispectrum .",
    "if we focus just on the sensitivity , the 21  cm power spectrum is more detectable than the bispectrum .",
    "however , the estimation of the expected constraint does not depend only on the sensitivity but also on the parameter dependences in the power spectrum or bispectrum .",
    "we now show the result of the fisher analysis applied to the power spectrum and the bispectrum . here , we focus on the equilateral type bispectrum .",
    "as previous mentioned , we constrain the eor model parameters using current telescopes , mwa and lofar , to study how the bispectrum improves the constraint on the eor parameters .",
    "note that we use both power spectrum and bispectrum for the fisher analysis for @xmath27=0.03 -1.0 @xmath85 divided into 9 bins .",
    "we show the confidence regions of the eor model parameters .",
    "note that the confidence regions obtained by the fisher analysis include physically meaningless regions such as @xmath86 .",
    "thus , we put a physically meaningful boundary condition on the parameter space and exclude the negative value regions .",
    "first , we show constraints on the eor model parameters obtained by the bispectrum at @xmath1=7 , 8 and 9 in fig.[fig : parameter1 ] .",
    "we can see that the constraints at @xmath878 are stronger than that those at other redshifts .",
    "this is because the 21 cm bispectrum as a function of the redshift has a peak at @xmath88 in our model and therefore the bispectrum is sensitive to the eor parameters at @xmath88 .",
    "we can also see that the constraint obtained assuming lofar is tighter than that obtained assuming mwa .",
    "this is because the sensitivity and resolution of lofar are better than those of mwa .",
    "the physical meaning of the inclination of the ellipse is as follows .",
    "if @xmath37 and @xmath40 become larger , neutral hydrogen atoms are ionized more efficiently . similarly ,",
    "decreasing @xmath89 also drives the progression of the reionization . both increasing @xmath37 and @xmath40 and decreasing @xmath39 play the same role in reionization .",
    "thus , there is a degeneracy between these parameters .",
    "however , the direction of the degeneracy is different between redshifts .",
    "this difference of direction between the redshifts enables us to break degeneracy .",
    "next , we compare the size of the constraints obtained by the power spectrum with that obtained by the bispectrum .",
    "we show the result in fig.[fig : parameter_z ] and table . [",
    "table : fisher2 ] . here , we combine the bispectrum and the power spectrum at @xmath1=7 , 8 and 9 .",
    "we find that the constraints from the bispectrum are tighter than those from the power spectrum . as you can see table .",
    "[ table : fisher2 ] , if we use the bispectrum , each parameter can be determined with an accuracy within a few @xmath90 for mwa and within @xmath91 for lofar .",
    "this accuracy is 1 - 2 orders of the magnitude better than constraints obtained from the power spectrum .",
    "we also find that using the lofar telescope results in tighter constraints than using the mwa telescopes .",
    "we find that the bispectrum can constrain the eor parameters tighter than the power spectrum although the signal to noise ratio of the power spectrum is better than that of the bispectrum .",
    "the bispectrum can give tight constraints because the derivative of the bispectrum with respect to the eor parameters is much larger than that of the power spectrum .",
    "however , we know that the fisher matrix is determined not only by the derivative of the signal but also by the thermal noise . in order to study the balance between the derivative of the signal and the thermal noise , we show the ratio of the square of the derivative with respect to the virial temperature , the ionizing efficiency and the maximum mean free path for the bispectrum and the power spectrum , @xmath92 , and the ratio of the square of the thermal noise error for mwa and lofar , @xmath93 , in fig.[fig : ratio_derivative ] .",
    "both are functions of the wave number .",
    "the upper panel of fig.[fig : ratio_derivative ] implies that the derivative of the bispectrum with respect to parameters is larger than that of the power spectrum ( @xmath94 ) except for the derivative .",
    "consequently , the derivative of the bispectrum contributes to the fisher matrix more than that of the power spectrum ( a larger fisher matrix results in tighter constraints ) .",
    "the difference between the redshifts is remarkable for the ratio of the derivative .",
    "in particular , the ratio of the derivative is large at @xmath1=8,9 although there are slight differences in the ratio of the thermal noise between redshifts . on the other hand",
    ", we can see how much the thermal error contributes to the fisher matrix in bottom of fig.[fig : ratio_derivative ] .",
    "although the signal of the bispectrum is larger than that of the power spectrum , the thermal noise of the bispectrum is also larger than that of the power spectrum .",
    "therefore , the advantage of the large value of the derivative of the bispectrum is offset by the thermal noise .",
    "however , the fisher matrix for the bispectrum becomes larger than that for the power spectrum when taking both the derivative and the thermal noise into account .",
