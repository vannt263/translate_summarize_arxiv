    "the composition and structure of neutron stars depend on the nature of strong interaction .",
    "neutron star matter encompasses a wide range of densities , from the density of iron nucleus at the surface of the star to several times normal nuclear matter density in the core .",
    "since the chemical potentials of nucleons and leptons increase rapidly with density in the interior of neutron stars , several novel phases of matter with large strangeness fraction such as , hyperonic matter , condensates of strange mesons and quark matter may appear there @xcite .",
    "it was first demonstrated by kaplan and nelson within a chiral @xmath3 model that @xmath0 meson may undergo bose - einstein condensation in dense matter formed in heavy ion collisions @xcite . in this model baryons",
    "directly couple with ( anti)kaons .",
    "the effective mass of antikaons decreases with increasing density because of the strongly attractive @xmath0-baryon interaction in dense matter .",
    "consequently , the in - medium energy of @xmath0 mesons in the zero - momentum state also decreases with density . the @xmath4-wave @xmath0 condensation sets in when the energy of @xmath0 mesons equals to its chemical potential .",
    "later , @xmath0 condensation in the core of neutron stars was studied by other groups using chiral models @xcite .",
    "also , bose - einstein condensation of @xmath0 mesons was investigated in the traditional meson exchange picture known as relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model @xcite . within the framework of rmf model ,",
    "baryon - baryon and ( anti)kaon - baryon interactions are treated in the same footing i.e. those are mediated by the exchange of mesons @xcite .",
    "it was noted in all these calculations that the typical threshold density of @xmath0 condensation in nucleons - only neutron star matter was about 2 - 4@xmath5 , where @xmath5 is normal nuclear matter density .",
    "however , the threshold of antikaon condensation is sensitive to the antikaon optical potential and depends more strongly on the equation of state . with further inclusion of hyperons ,",
    "@xmath0 condensation was found to occur at higher densities @xcite .",
    "recently , we have studied @xmath1 condensation along with @xmath0 condensation in neutron stars using a relativistic mean field model and its influence on the structure of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the threshold density of @xmath1 condensation is always higher than that of @xmath0 condensation .",
    "antikaon condensate makes the equation of state ( eos ) softer , thus resulting in smaller maximum mass stars compared with the case without any condensate . employing the eos including both @xmath0 and @xmath1 condensates , it was predicted @xcite that a stable sequence of superdense stars called the third family branch",
    "@xcite might exist beyond the neutron star branch .",
    "the compact stars in the third family branch have smaller radii than those of the neutron star branch @xcite .",
    "besides eos and antikaon optical potential depth , the threshold density of antikaon condensation is very much sensitive to the behaviour of antikaon energy and electron chemical potential at high density .",
    "the role of nucleon - nucleon and ( anti)kaon - nucleon correlation on antikaon condensation were investigated by pandharipande and collaborators @xcite .",
    "they found that strong nucleon - nucleon and ( anti)kaon - nucleon correlation raised the critical density for antikaon condensation to higher densities and predicted antikaon condensation might not be a possibility in neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the electron chemical potential used in the above mentioned calculations was obtained from modern realistic nucleon - nucleon interactions @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we are interested to find out how many body correlations which may be taken into account by density dependent meson - baryon couplings in a relativistic field theoretical model , affect the threshold of antikoan condensation in neutron star matter .",
    "there is a growing interest to derive a quantum hadron field theory from a microscopic approach to nuclear interactions .",
    "the motivation of such an approach is not only to retain the essential features of quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd ) @xcite , but also to deal with the complicated many body dynamics of strong interactions @xcite",
    ". an appropriate and successful microscopic approach to in medium nuclear interactions follows from dirac brueckner ( db ) calculations .",
    "various groups performed db calculations with realistic nucleon - nucleon interactions and reproduced empirical saturation properties of symmetric nuclear matter reasonably well @xcite .",
    "also nucleons - only neutron star matter was calculated in dirac brueckner theory @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that the bulk of the screening of nucleon - nucleon interaction in medium is taken into account by the local baryon density dependent db self energies @xcite .",
    "this makes relativistic many body dynamics to be approximated by a density dependent relativistic hadron ( ddrh ) field theory @xcite .",
    "a covariant and thermodynamically consistent ddrh field theory is obtained by making interaction vertices as lorentz scalar functionals of baryon field operators . in the mean field approximation",
    "this model reduces to the relativistic hartree description with density dependent meson - nucleon couplings .",
    "the density dependent meson - nucleon couplings are obtained from dirac brueckner self energies calculated with bonn , groningen and phenomenological density dependent potentials @xcite .",
    "the variational derivatives of vertices with respect to baryon fields give rise to rearrangement terms in baryon field equations @xcite .",
    "brockmann and toki @xcite first applied ddrh model without rearrangement terms to study finite nuclei . recently , ddrh model with rearrangement terms has been exploited to investigate deformed nuclei @xcite , hypernuclei @xcite , asymmetric nuclear matter and exotic nuclei @xcite and neutron star properties @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate antikaon condensation in beta equilibrated hyperon matter relevant to neutron stars and its role on the composition and structure of the compact stars in ddrh model .",
    "the paper is structured in the following way . in sec .",
    "ii , we describe ddrh model and different phases of matter",
    ". parameters of the model are discussed in sec .",
    "results of our calculation are explained in sec .",
    "iv . and sec .",
    "v provides a summary and conclusions .",
    "here , we discuss a phase transition from hadronic matter to antikaon condensed phase in compact stars . the hadronic phase is described within the framework of ddrh model .",
    "this phase is composed of all species of the baryon octet , electrons and muons .",
    "therefore , the total lagrangian density in the hadronic phase is written as @xmath6 . in ddrh model ,",
    "baryon - baryon interaction is given by the lagrangian density ( @xmath7 ) @xcite , @xmath8 and @xmath9    the field strength tensors for vector mesons are given by @xmath10    here @xmath11 denotes the isospin multiplets for baryons and the sum goes over baryon multiplets b = n,@xmath12,@xmath13,@xmath14 ; @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) is lepton spinor and @xmath17 is isospin operator .",
    "the interactions among baryons are mediated by the exchange of @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 mesons .",
    "in addition to these mesons the scalar - isovector meson @xmath21 is also included . and",
    "this is important for an asymmetric system . though the structure of ddrh lagrangian density closely follows that of rmf model , there are important differences between those models . in rmf calculations with density independent meson - baryon coupling constants , non - linear self interaction terms for scalar and vector fields",
    "are inserted to account for higher order density dependent contributions .",
    "but this is not needed here as meson - baryon vertices @xmath22 , where @xmath23 denotes @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 fields , are dependent on lorentz scalar functionals of baryon field operators and adjusted to the dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock ( dbhf ) calculations @xcite .",
    "there are two choices for the density dependence of meson - baryon couplings .",
    "one is the scalar density dependence ( sdd ) and the other one is the vector density dependence ( vdd ) @xcite . here",
    "we consider meson - baryon couplings @xmath24 to depend on vector density because it gives a more natural connection to the parameterization of db vertices . for vdd case , the density operator @xmath25 has the form , @xmath26=@xmath27 , where @xmath28 .",
    "as vertices @xmath22s are lorentz scalar functional of baryon field operators , the variation of @xmath29 with respect to @xmath30 gives , @xmath31 the rearrangement term @xmath32 which originates from the second term of eq .",
    "( 4 ) , naturally introduces additional contribution to vector self - energy @xcite .",
    "this is an important difference between rmf and ddrh theory .    here , we perform our calculation in the mean field approximation ( mfa ) . in this approximation",
    "vertex functionals are reduced to simpler forms using wick s theorem @xcite .",
    "the operator @xmath26 is replaced by ground state expectation value @xmath20 i.e. @xmath33 . hence meson - baryon vertices become function of total baryon density in the hadronic phase , @xmath34 this is known as vector density dependence of vertices @xcite . in mfa adopted here ,",
    "meson fields are replaced by their expectation values .",
    "only the time - like components of vector fields , and isospin 3-components of @xmath20 and @xmath21 fields have non - vanishing values in a uniform and static matter .",
    "the mean meson fields are denoted by @xmath18 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath21 .",

    "the total vector self energy for baryon b in the hadronic phase is @xmath49 now the usual vector self energy is @xmath50 also , the rearrangement term which is the second term in eq .",

    "this differs for members of isospin multiplets due to @xmath21 meson .    to obtain the eos ( pressure versus energy density ) of the pure hadronic phase , the equations of motion for mesons and baryons ( eqs .",
    "( 6)-(9 ) and eq .",
    "( 12 ) ) are solved self - consistently along with effective baryon mass in the mean field approximation keeping into consideration other constraints such as baryon number conservation , charge neutrality and beta equilibrium .",
    "the system is charge neutral and the condition of @xmath2-equilibrium is maintained .",
    "the charge neutrality condition is @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are electric charge and the number density of baryon b in the pure hadronic phase , respectively and @xmath57 and @xmath58 are number densities of electrons and muons respectively . in compact star interior ,",
    "chemical equilibrium is maintained through weak interactions such as @xmath59 and @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are baryons and l stands for leptons .",
    "therefore the generic equation relating chemical potentials for the above mentioned generalised @xmath2-decay processes is @xmath63 here @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the baryon number and charge of ith baryon and @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the chemical potentials of neutron and electron , respectively .",
    "the chemical potential of baryon b in the hadronic phase is expressed as @xmath68 it is noted that unlike rmf model , the rearrangement term appears in the expression of baryon chemical potential in ddrh model . in neutron stars ,",
    "electrons are converted to muons by @xmath69 when the electron chemical potential becomes equal to the muon mass .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath70 in compact stars .",
    "equation ( 18 ) implies that there are two independent chemical potentials @xmath66 and @xmath67 corresponding to two conserved charges i.e. baryon number and electric charge . the energy density ( @xmath71 )",
    "is related to the pressure ( @xmath72 ) in this phase through the gibbs - duhem relation @xmath73 here @xmath74 and @xmath75 are chemical potential and number density for i - th species .",
    "the expression of energy density in the hadronic phase is @xcite @xmath76 the rearrangement term does not contribute to the energy density explicitly , whereas it occurs in the pressure through baryon chemical potential .",
    "it is the rearrangement term that accounts for the energy - momentum conservation and thermodynamic consistency of the system @xcite .",
    "the pure antikaon ( @xmath77 ) condensed phase is composed of baryons , leptons and antikaons which are in chemical equilibrium under weak interactions and maintain local charge neutrality .",
    "the baryon - baryon interactions here are described by the lagrangian density of ddrh model .",

    ", baryons are embedded in antikaon condensates .",
    "earlier it was noted that baryons in the pure hadronic and antikaon condensed phase behaved differently because of their dynamical nature @xcite .",

    "we note the eos with and without @xmath0 condensate for case ii are stiffer compared with those of case i. this may be attributed to the stronger repulsion due to the larger value of @xmath139 in case ii . for case",
    "ii , we also get negative effective nucleon mass in n , p,@xmath12 matter with and without @xmath0 condensate at 6.72 @xmath5 and 6.60 @xmath5 respectively .",
    "it follows from the structure calculation using tov equations , the maximum masses of nucleons - only stars with and without @xmath0 condensate for bonn a set are 2.55@xmath179 and 2.32@xmath179 having central densities 5.64 and 6.84 @xmath5 , respectively . in this case , we find the radii for neutron stars with and without @xmath0 condensate are 10.88 km and 9.91 km , respectively .",
    "these values of maximum masses and radii in bonn a set are smaller than those of groningen set . for n , p,@xmath12 matter with and without @xmath0 condensate in both case",
    "i and case ii we find that the effective nucleon mass becomes negative before the maximum masses are reached .",
    "this feature was earlier found by others for n , p,@xmath12 matter without antikaon condensate @xcite . because of the behaviour of the parameterization of the couplings in the high density regime for bonn a set , the repulsion due to @xmath19 field becomes larger than the attraction of @xmath18 field .",
