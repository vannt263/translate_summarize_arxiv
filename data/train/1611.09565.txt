    "one of the main contemporary challenges of the life sciences is to understand the factors that allow for the maintenance of biodiversity @xcite .",
    "a fundamental proposition in population genetics and community ecology , the competitive exclusion principle  @xcite , suggests that when two genetic alleles or two biological species compete for the same resources only one species / allele will survive . despite its theoretical importance and its firm mathematical foundations ,",
    "many natural systems appear to violate this principle , allowing for coexistence of many competing species or ( higher than expected ) polygenic variations .    in community ecology , the simplest explanation for such a situation is niche partitioning , meaning that multiple limiting resources may give rise to a collection of species , ranging up to the number of resources , with each species excelling with respect to one resource  @xcite .",
    "however the identification of limiting resources is difficult in practice , and in some cases ( tropical trees  @xcite , fresh - water plankton  @xcite and coral reef  @xcite ) the niche - partitioning mechanism seems implausible .",
    "an understanding of possible alternative coexistence - promoting mechanism is a subject of much interest both in community ecology @xcite and population genetics .",
    "taking into account the inherent stochasticity in biological populations dynamics , one realizes that the biodiversity puzzle is , in fact , a question about _ time scales_. the dynamics of every population admits an absorbing state : once the species goes extinct , it can not recover again . accordingly",
    ", every biosystem suffers from a continuous loss of life forms , a process that reduces its diversity .",
    "biodiversity equilibrates when the rate of extinction matches the rate at which new types are introduced into the system as a result of speciation or mutation events ( or , for a local community , migration from a regional pool )",
    ".    an important theoretical framework in which this insight is implemented is the neutral model , both in its well - mixed form @xcite ( in genetics ) and in its spatial , mainland - island version @xcite ( in community ecology ) .",
    "the neutral model assumes that all species are demographically equivalent ( no selective advantage ) and that species abundance varies only due to genetic / ecological drift ( demographic stochasticity ) .",
    "when two species compete under these conditions , the persistence time of the community ( the time until one of them goes extinct , also known as the absorption time @xcite ) is , on average , @xmath0 generations , where @xmath0 is the size ( number of individuals ) of the community .",
    "if the timescale on which new types are introduced into the system ( by speciation , mutation or migration ) is comparable to the persistence time , the typical number of species will be larger than one .",
    "recently , a series of studies showed that the abundance variations in empirical ecological communities are much stronger than the predictions of the neutral model @xcite .",
    "this appears to reflect the presence of _ environmental _ stochasticity , i.e. , the random variations in species relative fitness caused by fluctuations in exogenous factors like precipitation , temperature , predation pressure and so on @xcite . demographic noise accounts for the stochastic factors that affect each individual independently , so the average fitness of a population is fixed and abundance fluctuations per generation scale like the square root of population size .",
    "conversely , under environmental stochasticity the fitness of all individuals in a certain population fluctuates in a correlated manner , leading to much stronger abundance variations .    based on this observation , a time - averaged neutral theory of biodiversity",
    "has been suggested @xcite , where environmental stochasticity affects the system but species are still symmetric since each species fitness , _ when averaged over time _ ,",
    "is identical .",
    "again , species go extinct at a certain rate , now determined by both demographic and environmental stochasticity , and biodiversity reflects the balance between extinction and speciation / migration rates .",
    "this model has been shown to fit quite nicely the static and dynamic characteristics of a ( local ) community of tropical trees @xcite ; both the species abundance distribution and the abundance variations are similar to the predictions of the model as obtained from numerical simulations .",
    "the inclusion of environmental stochasticity into the model opens up , again , the timescale problem .",
    "environmental stochasticity is stronger than drift , and overshadows its effect in large abundance populations .",
    "environmental noise at first sight appears to be a destabilizing factor : it increases the rate in which the system jumps from one state to another , and hence shortens the time until a population reaches a low - abundance state and goes extinct .",
    "the naive expectation , thus , is that environmental stochasticity shortens the persistence time , though one would like to quantify this argument and to find the @xmath0 dependence explicitly .",
    "however , under some circumstances environmental stochasticity may become a _ stabilizing _ mechanism , as suggested by chesson and collaborators @xcite .",
    "these authors show that environmental variations may enhance the chance of invasion of low - abundance species via the _ storage effect _ : rare species , when compared with common species , have fewer per - capita losses when their fitness is low and more gains when their fitness is high . as a result ,",
    "the system may support a stable equilibrium : every species abundance fluctuates , but all are peaked about some finite value by a noise - induced stabilizing force .",
    "chesson and coworkers introduces the _ lottery model _ , a minimal model that captures the essence of the storage effect , and analyzed its stability properties .",
    "however , they considered a system with pure environmental noise and without demographic stochasticity .",
    "in such a system there is no extinction per se , as population density may take arbitrarily small values .",
    "accordingly , the criteria they used to define a stable equilibrium was the normalizability of the probability density function . this strategy did not allow them to calculate extinction times , making it impossible to analyze diversification rates .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite , hidalgo et .",
    "al . considered the two - species community persistence problem in the presence of environmental stochasticity , with and without storage . like @xcite",
    ", they analyzed the dynamics of a two - species community with pure environmental noise , such that the number of individuals belonging to each of the species is not necessarily an integer .",
    "extinction was defined , in their work , as the case where the density of a species goes below one individual ; for a community of @xmath0 individuals extinction happens when the density is smaller than @xmath1 .",
    "looking at the system under dichotomous ( telegraphic ) environmental noise , they were able to calculate the large @xmath0 asymptotic behavior of extinction times for a time - averaged - neutral community .",
    "this procedure may be justified , as in the large @xmath0 limit the discreteness of agents is less important , since the number of individuals is typically large , so one may replace the demographic noise by a threshold value at @xmath1 . to close the gap between the asymptotic behavior at large @xmath0 and the regimes where demographic noise is important , hidalgo and coworkers suggested the existence of ( one or two parameter ) scaling functions and provide a numerical evidence to support their conjecture .    here",
    "we solve the persistence time problem in all its glory , taking into account explicitly both demographic and environmental stochasticity .",
    "this allows us to extend the theory suggested by hidalgo et al . in the following senses :    1 .",
    "an explicit , closed form for the scaling functions ( in terms of a single or a double integral ) is derived , so the answer covers all the range of parameters .",
    "in particular our formulas converge to the pure demographic limit when the environmental stochasticity vanishes .",
    "2 .   the expressions suggested in @xcite for the large @xmath0 limit are recovered , but we can calculate also subleading terms in this asymptotic series .",
    "this allows us to identify the parameter region where the asymptotic is accurate , and to suggest simple analytic approximations that cover a much wider region of parameters .",
    "we can calculate the persistence time for a single mutant .",
    "this is an important quantity , as it sets the threshold for clonal interference and may be relevant to the small island effect in island biogeography ( see next section ) .",
    "moreover , we have extended the work of @xcite to include the case where one species has a time independent selective advantage with respect to the other species , superimposed on the environmental variations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section we provide a few basic intuitive arguments and a summary of the main results .",
    "section [ demo ] deals with the case of pure demographic noise , in section [ maritan ] we consider the case of demographic and environmental noise without storage effect , and in [ chesson ] the case with storage effect .",
    "section [ selection ] is devoted to the effect of selection on persistence time when it acts against the storage mechanism , and is followed by a discussion section . for the sake of completeness we describe in appendices the results for a system with selection and pure demographic noise ( appendix [ apb ] ) and selection with both environmental and demographic noise , but without storage ( appendix [ apc ] ) .",
    "in this section we explain the main issues considered along this paper , introduce the notations , provide a glossary ( see table 1 ) and briefly sketch the main results .      throughout this paper",
    "we consider a two  species \" ( genetic types , zoological species , bacterial strains ) playing a zero - sum game in a finite size community : one individual is chosen at random to die and is removed , with its slot being captured by an offspring of another individual , chosen with some probability that reflects its ( momentarily ) relative fitness .",
    "such a stochastic birth - death process leads , inevitably , to the extinction of one of the species , and our goal is to calculate how much time , on average , it takes for the system to reach this monotypic state ( the time to absorption ) , given the size of the community , @xmath0 , and the initial conditions , in which species 1 , say , is represented by @xmath2 individuals and species 2 has @xmath3 individuals .",
    "we do not calculate here the fixation time , which is defined as the average time it takes to a specific species to reach @xmath0 _ conditioned on _ its success .",
    "the quantity we are looking at measures the persistence time of a community ( or the time to fixation or loss ) .",
    "while we provide expressions for any initial condition , two special cases are of particular importance .",
    "one is the case of a single mutant introduced into a system , i.e. , @xmath4 .",
    "this is the relevant case when a new type appears in a single mutation / speciation event , or when the system is subject to weak immigration from a regional pool .",
    "the biodiversity ( species richness , genetic polymorphism ) of such a system depends on the balance between the rate of appearance of new types ( rate of mutation / migration / speciation ) and the average time it takes for a single mutant to reach either zero or @xmath0 . if the rate of mutation is small ( in units of inverse persistence time ) , the community will be monotypic most of the time . if the rate is high , the typical state has more than one species , and thus the ratio between these two rates determines the threshold for clonal interference @xcite . by the same token , a recently proposed explanation for what known in island biogeography as the small island effect suggests that the number of niches per island is fixed and for small islands the rate of absorption is smaller that the rate of immigration @xcite . under these assumption ,",
    "an island is  small \" as long as the immigration rate is smaller than the inverse of the persistence time calculated here .",
    "another interesting scenario is the case where both @xmath2 and @xmath3 are initially large .",
    "this may happen when the community was subject to strong invasion , when speciation occurs allopatrically and then the two groups mix again , for protracted speciation @xcite or in experiments in which two bacterial strains or two vegetation species are mixed @xcite .",
    "one may get insight into the persistence time in this case by identifying the initial state for which this time is maximized ( e.g. , in a symmetric system this will be the initial state @xmath5 ) and calculating the persistence time for this state . in what follows",
    "we provide simple expressions for these two cases : the maximum value of the expected persistence time and the expected persistence time for a single mutant .",
    "the reproductive success of any individual is subject to many random events . in our system , this property is reflected in the random nature of the birth - death process .",
    "when the two species in the community are demographically identical , and population variations are driven solely by demographic noise ( one individual is chosen to die and another is chosen to reproduce , both choices are random and the species affiliation does not play any role ) , the dynamics is known as _",
    "neutral_. under neutral dynamics the maximum value of the expected persistence time ( measured in units of generations , see below ) is known to be proportional to @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "we review the features of the neutral model in section [ demo ] below .",
    "when one species has a selective advantage with respect to the other , its chance to capture the whole community is , of course , larger . in the game considered here",
    "we always kill one individual at random , with no distinction between species , but if species 1 , say , has a selective advantage , the per capita chance of an individual of species 1 to capture the empty slot is larger than the chance of a species 2 individual .",
    "the difference between these two per capita chances is proportional to the selection parameter @xmath6 .",
    "on average , a species with selective advantage grows exponentially , so the population of the fitter species ( say , species 1 ) will grow like @xmath7 , and the time it takes to reach @xmath0 from @xmath8 will scale like @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "this is indeed the case , and the details of the calculation are given below ( appendix [ apb ] ) .",
    "the paper is focused on the effect of environmental stochasticity on the persistence time .",
    "as the environmental conditions vary , the relative fitness of species may change .",
    "accordingly , for large populations the effect of environmental stochasticity is more important than the drift @xcite .",
    "however , without demographic stochasticity there is no extinction ; to calculate extinction times one must either consider explicitly the demographic noise , as we are doing here , or impose a threshold on the density at the level of one individual , as done in @xcite .",
    "when both species have the same average fitness , but the fitnesses fluctuate randomly so that at any single moment one of them is superior ( i.e. , species fitness varies in time , but when averaged over time the two species are still symmetric ) we speak about a system under environmental stochasticity and characterize it by two quantities : the squared amplitude of fitness variations @xmath10 and the correlation time of the environment ( in units of generations ) @xmath11 .",
    "environmental stochasticity may be superimposed on a time independent fitness advantage of one species , and in that case we make a distinction between selection ( the time independent component of the relative fitness ) and stochasticity ( fitness fluctuations with zero average over time ) .",
    "the simplest way to think about a system driven by environmental stochasticity ( with no selection ) is to consider it as a random walk in the logarithmic space . when the environment gives an instantaneous fitness advantage to one species its population grows exponentially , and when the environment switches it shrinks exponentially , so overall the log - population is doing a random walk and the step size is proportional to @xmath12 . since the typical time needed for a random walker to cross a distance @xmath13 scales like @xmath14 , one expects that the maximum persistence time for a community of size @xmath0 will scale like @xmath15 for large @xmath0 .",
    "this asymptotic behavior was found by hidalgo et .",
    "al @xcite . here ,",
    "in section [ maritan ] , we provide the expression for any @xmath0 and any initial conditions ( eqs .",
    "[ eq10 ] and [ eq11 ] ) , calculate the leading corrections to the large @xmath0 result and identify the region in which this log squared asymptotics is valid ( eqs .",
    "[ eq12 ] and [ eq12a ] ) .",
    "we also show that the result for a single mutant initial condition has a different scaling ( eq . [ eq11c ] ) and explain why this happens .",
    "environmental stochasticity thus seems to be a destabilizing factor , as it increases the amplitude of abundance fluctuations and shortens the persistence timescale from @xmath0 generation ( with pure demographic noise ) to @xmath15 .",
    "however , under some circumstances the environmental stochasticity stabilizes the system and increase substantially the persistence time .",
    "this possibility was discovered by chesson and coworkers@xcite , and is known as the storage effect .",
    "the system considered here may provide a realization of the simplest example given for the storage effect , the chesson - warner lottery game . to do that",
    ", one may think about individuals as trees , say , and assume that the seed bank in the soil reflects the abundance of each species .",
    "upon death of an individual one of the seeds is chosen to capture its location as an adult tree with a chance proportional to its fitness , so the overall chance of a species to increase its population reflects both its abundance and its instantaneous fitness , superimposed nonlinearly . as an example let us think about a `` winner takes all '' case , where the species with higher fitness wins the empty slot for certainty . starting with 8 red individuals and 2 green in a community of 10 , the chance to end up with 7 red and three green",
    "is 0.4 ( a red is killed with probability 0.8 , the green captures the slot with probability 1/2 since it is preferred half of the time ) while the chance to end up in the 9:1 state is only 1/10 .",
    "rare species have a larger chance to grow in abundance just because they are rare .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the dynamics of the system takes place in a series of duels , as described in the last subsection , the chance for an interspecific duel will be @xmath16 , and so the probabilities to end up at 9:1 or at 7:3 will be the same : @xmath17 , meaning that there is no preference to rare or common species and no storage effect .",
    "the persistence time for a system with environmental noise and storage effect was considered by @xcite , who suggested that for large @xmath0 it scales like @xmath18 .",
    "our analysis provides an expression for any @xmath0 and any initial condition ( eq . [ eq23 ] ) , with an analysis of the large @xmath0 behavior and the crossover to the @xmath18 regime ( eq .",
    "[ eq27 ] ) .",
    "we also consider the same problem for a single mutant ( eq . [ eq27a ] ) , showing that in this case the scaling of the persistence time with @xmath0 is also @xmath18 , and that the difference between the maximum persistence time and the single mutant case is only a factor of @xmath19 .",
    "the situations described so far correspond to the standard neutral model ( perfect demographic equivalence , zero fitness differences between species and individuals ) and to the time - averaged neutral model ( tntb ) @xcite , where the species have the same fitness on average , but at each moment one species has higher fitness . in both cases ,",
    "stochasticity ( demographic or environmental ) is the only driver of abundance variations .",
    "however , the generic scenario appears to be the case where a time independent selective advantage to one of the species is superimposed on environmental variations that may give instantaneous superiority to its opponent .",
    "we consider this situation , with and without storage effect , in section [ selection ] and appendix [ apc ] .",
    "for the case without storage we provide the general formula in ( [ eq64 ] ) , but in the large @xmath0 limit selection alone determines the persistence time ( eq . [ eq70 ] ) . with storage",
    "the situation is much more interesting : there is a scaled selection parameter @xmath20 , and as long as this parameter is smaller than one , noise induced stabilization wins and the time to extinction grows superlinearly with @xmath0 ( like @xmath21 ) .",

    "to set the framework for the next sections and to clarify a few technical points , let us begin by considering the already studied @xcite case of a two species system with fixed community size @xmath0 and pure demographic noise .",

    "coexistence of many competing species in a local community and the maintenance of multiple alleles in a gene pool are ubiquitous in natural systems .",
    "simple explanations to these phenomena , like strong niche differentiation ( in ecology ) or heterozygote advantage ( in population genetics ) , are not plausible in many of the systems considered so far .",
    "the search for alternative coexistence mechanisms became a subject of intensive research .",
    "the ( temporal ) storage effect , suggested by chesson and coworkers , is apparently an appealing candidate .",
    "environmental stochasticity is almost always quite strong in biosystems ( see , e.g. @xcite , where environmental stochasticity dominates system fluctuations even under extremely stable external conditions . see also @xcite for an analysis of  standard \" high diversity ecosystems , showing that the main driver is environmental noise ) .",
    "therefore , the fact that it may become a stabilizing factor , supporting the growth of rare species and providing an effective frequency dependent selective mechanism is very appealing .",
    "from a different perspective , the ubiquitous presence of environmental stochasticity leads to attempts to incorporate it into the neutral model - one of the main theoretical frameworks in both population genetics and community ecology @xcite .",
    "biodiversity under neutral dynamics relays on speciation - absorption equilibrium , and as we have seen here , environmental stochasticity affects strongly the absorption rates .",
    "the works published so far have relied on a mix of numerical experiments and a few analytic arguments .",
    "a general theoretical understanding of the time averaged neutral model , comparable with classical results that were obtained for the neutral model with demographic stochasticity ( like the fisher log - series and zero - sum multinomials ) , is still missing .",
    "herein we have extended the results of @xcite and discussed a few models that incorporate environmental stochasticity , selection and demographic noise , for a two species community .",
    "these results are of interest in and of themselves , as they provide a new insight to the classical works of @xcite , shedding light on the question of a community s persistence time . moreover ,",
    "our results provide an answer to a fundamental question : at what rate one should introduce new types to the system in order to maintain it in a diverse state .",
    "there are still many open questions , including the behavior of higher moments of the persistence time for the model with storage ( without storage , or with pure demographic noise , the variance of the persistence time is equal to the time itself , as one can understand from the galton - watson theory or from the theory of first passage time , correspondingly ) .",
    "the problem of the fixation time ( which is assumed to determine the pace of the evolutionary process ) is also of interest .",
    "however , we believe that the most important aspect of the work presented here is as a first step towards an analytic theory of neutral dynamics with environmental stochasticity . generalization of our work from the two species case to a many species community will allow one to find the species abundance distributions and the species richness for the time averaged neutral theory of biodiversity in stable mutation - extinction equilibrium , and even to incorporate weak effects of selection into the otherwise symmetric model ( as we did numerically in @xcite ) .",
