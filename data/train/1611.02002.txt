    "this paper is devoted to the study of _ cocomparability graphs _ , which are the complements of comparability graphs .",
    "_ a comparability graph _ is simply an undirected graph that admits a transitive acyclic orientation of its edges .",
    "comparability graphs are well - studied and arise naturally in the process of modeling real - life problems , especially those involving partial orders . for a survey see @xcite .",
    "we also consider _ interval graphs _ which are the intersection graphs of a family of intervals on the real line .",
    "comparability graphs and cocomparability graphs are well - known subclasses of perfect graphs @xcite ; and interval graphs are a well - known subclass of cocomparability graphs @xcite . clearly a given cocomparability graph @xmath0 together with an acyclic transitive orientation of the edges of @xmath2 ( the corresponding comparability graph ) can be equivalently represented by a poset @xmath3 ; thus new results in any of these three areas immediately translate to the other two areas . in this paper",
    ", we will often omit the translations but it is important to keep in mind that they exist .",
    "a triple @xmath4 of vertices forms an _ asteroidal triple _ if the vertices are pairwise independent , and every pair remains connected when the third vertex and its neighborhood are removed from the graph .",
    "an _ asteroidal triple free graph _",
    "( at - free for short ) is a graph with no asteroidal triples .",
    "it is well - known that at - free graphs strictly contain cocomparability graphs , see @xcite .",
    "a classical way to characterize a cocomparability graph is by means of an _ umbrella - free _ total ordering of its vertices . in an ordering @xmath5 of @xmath0 s vertices , an _ umbrella _",
    "is a triple of vertices @xmath6 such that @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "it has been observed in @xcite that a graph is a cocomparability graph if and only if it admits an umbrella - free ordering .",
    "we will also call an umbrella - free ordering a _ cocomp ordering_. in a similar way , interval graphs are characterized by interval orderings , where an _ interval ordering _",
    "@xmath5 is an ordering of the graph s vertices that does not admit a triple of vertices @xmath6 such that @xmath7 , @xmath10 , and @xmath9 .",
    "( notice that an interval ordering is a cocomp ordering . )",
    "other characterizations of interval graphs appear in theorem [ th : gilhof ] .    the paper studies the relationships shared by interval and cocomparability graphs and is motivated by some recents results :    * for the minimum path cover ( mpc ) problem ( a minimum set of paths such that each vertex of @xmath0 belongs to exactly one path in the set ) , corneil , dalton and habib showed that the greedy mpc algorithm for interval graphs , when applied to a lexicographic depth first search ( ldfs ) cocomp ordering provides a certifying solution for cocomparability graphs ( see @xcite ) . * for the problem of producing a cocomp ordering ( assuming the graph is cocomparability ) dusart and habib showed that the multisweep lexicographic breadth first search ( lbfs)@xmath11 algorithm to find an interval ordering also finds a cocomp ordering ( @xcite ) .",
    "note that @xmath12 lbfss must be used in order to guarantee these results .",
    "other similar results will be surveyed in subsection [ list ] . from these results ,",
    "some natural questions arise : do cocomparability graphs have some kind of hidden interval structure that allows the `` lifting '' of some interval graph algorithms to cocomparability graphs ? what is the role played by graph searches lbfs and ldfs and are there other searches / problems where similar results hold ?    as mentioned previously , interval graphs form a strict subclass of cocomparability graphs .",
    "it is also known that every minimal triangulation of a cocomparability graph is an interval graph @xcite . in section",
    "[ sec : lattstruct ] of this article , we will show that we can equip the set of maximal cliques of a cocomparability graph with a lattice structure where every chain of the lattice forms an interval graph .",
    "note that condition ( iii ) of theorem [ th : gilhof ] states that a graph @xmath0 is an interval graph if and only if the maximal cliques of @xmath0 can be linearly ordered so that for every vertex @xmath13 , the cliques containing @xmath13 appear consecutively .",
    "thus , through the lattice , a cocomparability graph can be seen as a special composition of interval graphs . in particular , given a cocomparability graph @xmath0 with @xmath14 a transitive orientation of @xmath2 , the lattice @xmath15 is formed on the set of maximal antichains of @xmath14 ( i.e. , the maximal cliques of @xmath0 ) .",

    "( respectively _ interval _ ) _ subgraph _ if and only if @xmath18 is a chordal graph and @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 is not a chordal ( respectively interval ) graph .",
    "our final result of subsection [ sec : maximalinter ] states that every maximal interval subgraph of a cocomparability graph is also a maximal chordal subgraph .    in sections [ alg ] and [ sec : simplicial ]",
    "we turn our attention to algorithmic applications of the theory previously developed on the lattice @xmath15 . in section [ alg ]",
    "we present algorithm chainclique which on input a graph @xmath0 and a total ordering @xmath5 of @xmath22 returns an ordered set of cliques that collectively form an interval subgraph of @xmath0 .",
    "we then introduce a new graph search ( localmns ) that is very close to maximal neighborhood search ( mns ) , which is a generalization of mcs , ldfs and lbfs .",
    "we show that chainclique with @xmath5 being a localmns cocomparability ordering of @xmath0 returns a maximal interval subgraph of the cocomparability graph @xmath0 ; this algorithm also gives us a way to compute a minimal interval extension of a partial order ( definitions given in subsection [ note ] ) . section [ sec : simplicial ] uses chainclique to compute the set of simplicial vertices in a cocomparability graph .",

    "the problem of finding a maximal chordal subgraph of an arbitrary graph has been studied in @xcite and an algorithm with complexity @xmath509 has been proved . in this section , using a new graph search we will improve this to @xmath510 for cocomparability graphs .      in the introduction we presented two problems on cocomparability graphs solvable by graph searching where these algorithms are very similar to a corresponding algorithm on interval graphs .",
    "in subsection [ list ] we present other problems where this `` lifting '' technique provides new easily implementable cocomparability graph algorithms .",
    "all of the algorithms that we mention use a technique called the `` @xmath511 tie - break rule '' in which a total ordering @xmath46 of @xmath22 is used to break ties in a particular graph search @xmath512 . in particular , the next chosen vertex in @xmath512 will be the _ rightmost _ tied vertex in @xmath46 .",
    "such a tie - breaking search will be denoted @xmath512@xmath513 .",
    "many of these examples use that fact that some searches ( most notably ldfs ) when applied as a `` @xmath511-sweep '' to a cocomp ordering produce a vertex ordering that is also a cocomp ordering .",
    "in fact , in @xcite there is a characterization of the graph searches that have this property of preserving a cocomp ordering . given a cocomparability graph @xmath0 , computing a cocomp",
    "ordering can be done in linear time ,  @xcite .",

    "following the two examples presented in the introduction we now present three other examples of search based algorithms for other problems on cocomparability graphs :    * let @xmath13 be the last vertex of an arbitrary lbfs of cocomp graph @xmath0 and let @xmath65 be the last vertex of an arbitrary lbfs starting at @xmath13",

    "a simple greedy algorithm for finding the maximum independent set ( mis ) in an interval graph also solves the problem on cocomparability graphs where @xmath5 is part of the input to the algorithm @xcite .",
    "it is well known that for any graph @xmath517 with mis @xmath518 , the set @xmath519 forms a minimum cardinality vertex cover ( i.e. , every edge in @xmath520 has at least one endpoint in @xmath521 ) .",
    "the mis algorithm in @xcite certifies the constructed mis by constructing a clique cover ( i.e. , a set of cliques such that each vertex belongs to exactly one clique in the set ) of the same cardinality as the mis .",
    "recall that cocomparability graphs are perfect .",
    "the last two algorithms in the list as well as the two in the introduction suggest the existence of an interesting relationship between interval and cocomparability graphs .",
    "we believe that the basis of this relationship is the lattice @xmath15 , which characterizes cocomparability graphs and shows that a cocomparability graph can be seen as a composition of interval graphs ( i.e. , the maximal chains of cliques of @xmath15 ) .      in this section",
    ", we develop an algorithm that computes a maximal chain of the lattice @xmath352 and show that it forms a maximal interval and chordal subgraph .",
    "the problem of finding a maximal interval subgraph is the dual of the problem of finding a minimal interval completion ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the algorithm that we are going to present uses a new graph search that we call localmns , since it shares a lot of similarities with mns .",
    "this algorithm also gives us a way to compute a minimal interval extension of a partial order .",
