    "following  five - year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) observations \" @xcite , the theory of inflation are proved to be the most promising theory of the early universe before the big bang .    as a favored scenario to explain the observational data , it is customary to introduce a scalar field called inflaton .",
    "what kind of theoretical frameworks are the most appropriate to describe the theory of particle physics , inflation and the recent observations .",
    "it seems to require a far richer structure of contents than that of the standard theory of particles . as far as the 4d",
    ", @xmath4 supergravity can play an elementary role in the theory of the space - time and the particles @xcite , it can also be essential in the theory of the early universe as an effective field theory .",
    "supergravity , however , has been confronting with the difficulties , such as the @xmath5-problem and the supersymmetry breaking mechanism has been studied by many authors @xcite .",
    "we have investigated to prevail over these difficulties in refs.@xcite by using the modular invariant supergravity induced from superstring @xcite .",
    "we found that the interplay between the dilaton field @xmath6 and gauge - singlet scalar @xmath7 could give rise to sufficient inflation .",
    "the model is free from the the @xmath5-problem and realizes appropriate amount of inflation as well as the tt angular power spectrum .    in supergravity , gravitino is a unique object and cosmological meanings of gravitino is one of the most important problem . in this letter",
    "we will investigate the gravitino production just after the end of inflation .",
    "first we will briefly review the model and the former results @xcite as follows : it is convenient to introduce the dilaton field @xmath6 , a chiral superfield @xmath7 and the modular field @xmath0 . here ,",
    "all the matter fields are set to zero for simplicity .",
    "then , the effective no - scale type khler potential and the effective superpotential that incorporate modular invariance are given by : @xmath8,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the dedekind @xmath5-function , defined by : @xmath10 the parameter @xmath11 and @xmath12 are treated as free parameters in this letter as discussed in ref.@xcite .",

    "we had found that the potential @xmath16 at @xmath14 has a stable minimum at for the values @xmath17 , @xmath18 and obtained @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 are used .",
    "the inflationary trajectory can be well approximated by @xmath24 which corresponds to the trajectory of the stable minimum for both @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the slow - roll parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 satisfy the slow - roll conditions . the the number of @xmath27-folds @xmath28 , by fixing the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 and integrating from @xmath31 to @xmath32 , i.e. our potential can produce a cosmologically plausible number of @xmath27-folds @xcite . here",
    "@xmath33 is the value corresponding to the scale @xmath34 mpc@xmath35 .",
    "we can also compute the scalar spectral index and its running that describe the scale dependence of the spectrum of the primordial density perturbation @xmath36 @xcite ; these indices are defined by @xmath37 these are approximated in the slow - roll paradigm as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is an extra slow - roll parameter that includes the trivial third derivative of the potential . substituting @xmath33 into these equations",
    ", we have @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "because @xmath42 is not equal to 1 and @xmath43 is almost negligible , our model suggests a tilted power law spectrum .",
    "the value of @xmath44 is consistent with the recent observations ; the best fit of five - year wmap data using the power law @xmath45cdm model is @xmath46 @xcite . finally , estimating the spectrum @xmath47 in the slow - roll approximation ( sra ) , @xmath48 we find @xmath49 .",
    "this result matches the measurements as well @xcite . incidentally speaking",
    ", the energy scale @xmath50 is also within the constrained range obtained by liddle and lyth @xcite .    in order to study on the angular power spectrum ,",
    "we need the tensor perturbation ( the gravitational wave ) spectrum which is given as follows : @xmath51 in sra , the spectral index of @xmath52 is given by the slow - roll parameters @xmath53 and @xmath5 as @xmath54 using these parameters @xmath55 and @xmath56 angular spectrum were well fitted to the wmap data @xcite .    however , one of the problems we met is that a tachyonic mode inevitably appear from the mass term of modular field @xmath0 .",

    "however , if we see the higher order terms of expansion , then the terms spontaneously break a symmetry . in this case",
    "the modular invariance of the model is broken after the end of inflation .",
    "the physical effect of this symmetry breaking will be discussed in following works .",
    "the appearance of the tachyonic state is , however , rather a general feature of superstring inspired supergravity model @xcite .",
    "the problem is investigated radically to consider all angles of situations of no - scale supergravity , including whether or not the fact is a defect .",
    "however , in order to emphasize that the model is still phenomenologically effective , we choose the case of the modular superfield @xmath0 is trivial and only is put to @xmath61 in @xmath62 and @xmath58 , since the modular superfield @xmath0 did not play any roles in our former papers",
    ". we should be satisfied in our achievements , at this moment , that our model can well explain the inflation and just after the inflation ( preheating stage ) at phenomenological level .",
    "now we will investigate the properties of gravitino and other fields .",
    "first , gravitino mass is given in this case @xmath63 where @xmath64 gev@xmath65sec and @xmath66 gev are used .",
    "now we will concentrate only on the model to investigate the gravitino production after inflation .",
    "if the chaotic potential @xmath67 is considered , the equation of motion of the scalar field is given by @xmath68    then the general solution of this differential equation is obtained as @xmath69 here , by taking limit @xmath70 , @xmath71 follows , and if the amplitude @xmath72 is defined @xmath73 then solution is damping oscillation @xmath74 in our model , by expanding @xmath58 around the minimum of @xmath75 , @xmath76 and fixed @xmath14 , and by providing @xmath75 and @xmath76 are real , then we obtained @xmath75 , @xmath76 as follows : @xmath77}{m_s t } , \\\\ & & y(t)= \\frac{1}{\\eta^2 ( 1 ) e^{1/3 } c } e^{-\\frac{s(t)}{3b}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these formula are frequently used in the following calculations .",
    "it is proved that the evolutions of @xmath6 breaks supersymmetry after the end of inflation .    in order to argue on the evolution of @xmath78terms , the supersymmetry breaking scale @xmath79 is defined by kallosh et al .",
    "@xcite as follows : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is contribution of @xmath82term to the potential , and @xmath83 is @xmath84 , \\qquad\\qquad m \\equiv e^{k/2 } w.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath78term supersymmetry breaking scale is also given by nilles et al .",
    "@xcite @xmath85 @xmath86 give a `` measure '' of the size of the supersymmetry breaking provided by the @xmath78term associated with the @xmath87-th scalar field , which is the same as @xmath79 .",
    "the factor @xmath88 in front of @xmath89 shows @xmath89 are real . in our model",
    "these quantities are estimated by calculating @xmath90 , @xmath91 and time derivatives of these fields , finally @xmath86 are given by @xmath92 where numerical values are estimated at the stationary points @xmath93 , @xmath94 which are also asymptotic values .    by inserting the stationary values of @xmath6 , @xmath7 and define @xmath95 , @xmath96 , we obtain the ratios @xmath97 , @xmath98 @xmath99 & & r_y=\\frac{\\alpha_y}{\\alpha_s+\\alpha_y}=6.63 \\times 10^{-5},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , supersymmetry is overwhelmingly broken by superfield @xmath6 .",
    "contrary to the fact pointed out by nilles et al .",
    "@xcite , that the interchange of supersymmetry breaking fields occurs , it does not occur in our model .",
    "the evolution of the ratios is shown at fig.1 .     and",
    "@xmath7 to the supersymmetry breaking during their evolution . that of @xmath97 corresponds to the highest curve , @xmath98 the lowest .",
    ", width=264 ]",
    "here we will show the value of fermion masses .",
    "the masses of goldstino @xmath100 and supersymmetric partners @xmath101 are obtained as follows . using @xmath102 and @xmath103",
    ", we obtain : @xmath104 where we have neglected the hermite conjugate terms",
    ". then , the values are @xmath105 since @xmath100 is massless and @xmath6 breaks supersymmetry , @xmath100 state is identified with goldstino , which is absorbed into gravitino by super - higgs mechanism @xcite .",
    "@xmath101 is the supersymmetric partners of @xmath7 .    following endo et al .",
    "@xcite , the decay rate @xmath106 is calculated in our model : @xmath107 because the gravitino production comes only from inflaton @xmath6 . @xmath108 and @xmath109 are respectively well defined ( by assuming the fields real ) at stationary points of three scalars @xmath6,@xmath7 and @xmath0 . the mass parameter included in @xmath110 is used as : @xmath111 now the value of the decay rate eq.([decay ] ) is given by @xmath112 the decay time @xmath113 is + @xmath114 this process occurs almost instantly .",
    "thus it is quite possible that primordial gravitino production occurs very rapidly .",
    "now we should choose a model to determine the preheating temperature by inflaton decay into the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) or nmssm particles .",
    "we will assume the instant preheating mechanism @xcite , because this method is mathematically easier to control than that of parametric resonance @xcite .",
    "it is not unique to take in the ordinary particles into no - scale supergravity .",
    "therefore we will assume that the effective superpotential during the oscillations of inflaton is given as follows : @xmath115 where @xmath6 is dilaton ( inflaton ) , @xmath116 are the gauge singlet right handed neutrinos , @xmath117 are the lepton doublet superfields and @xmath118 is the higgs superfield . in this letter , we will apply the instant preheating mechanism @xcite in order to estimate the effects of preheating .",
    "after single oscillation of inflaton , the number density @xmath119 is given by @xmath120 by integrating to obtain the number density @xmath119 of right handed sneutrinos @xmath121 : @xmath122 where we concentrated on the case @xmath123 .",
    "thus , the preheating temperature is obtained just after thermal equilibrium : @xmath124 where the constants are chosen as @xmath125 and @xmath126 in the case of mssm . by using the formula given in ref.@xcite , the yield variable for gravitino @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the number density of gravitino and @xmath129 is the entropy density of matters , is estimated to @xmath130 the obtained value seems too large at a first glance .",
    "however , the produced gravitinos decay rather very rapid , for instance , the decay time of gravitino to a photon and a photino @xmath131 is calculated for @xmath132 as : @xmath133 where we have used the formula derived in ref.@xcite . because the primordial gravitinos decay very rapidly and the preheating temperature is lower than the gravitino mass , the effect to the standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) scenario @xcite ( see also refs.@xcite ) may be negligible in our model .",
    "we have investigated on the gravitino production just after the end of inflation through the inflaton ( dilaton ) decay .",
    "the model we used , cleared the @xmath5-problem and appeared to predict successfully the values of observations at inflation era .",
    "it predicted for examples , the indices @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the value of @xmath44 is consistent with the recent observations ; the best fit of five - year wmap data using the power law @xmath45cdm model is @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the estimation of the spectrum was as @xmath49 , which result matches the measurements as well @xcite .    because the mass of gravitino is calculated as @xmath134gev , it is rather heavy and",
    "may be unstable , therefore , may not be considered as the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) or the next lightest ( nlsp ) and not a dark matter candidate discussed in refs.@xcite .",
    "however the main topic of supergravity at present stage of the theory is whether the gravitino exist or not in nature despite its mass . on the other hand ,",
    "the supersymmetry breaking is triggered by @xmath78term of the inflaton ( dilaton ) superfield and the interchange of supersymmetry breaking fields does not occur in our model .",
    "supersymmetry is overwhelmingly broken by superfield @xmath6 only , contrary to the fact of the interchange of supersymmetry breaking fields pointed out by nilles et al .",
    "@xcite . from the masses of inflaton @xmath6 and gravitino mass @xmath135",
    ", the decay rate of the inflaton to two gravitinos is estimated to @xmath136 .",
    "the gravitinos are produced almost instantly just after the end of inflation .",
    "the preheating temperature is also estimated by assuming the instant preheating mechanism and by using a tentative model among nmssm models @xcite in order to calculate the entropy density .",
    "then the yield variable for gravitino takes rather large value , however the decay time appears very rapid and disappear before the bbn stage of the universe .",
    "therefore we conclude that our present model seems consistent with the present situation of observations for gravitino production and nmssm matters .",
    "nonetheless , one of the problems we met is that a tachyonic mode inevitably appear from the mass term of modular field @xmath0 , though we explained the fact by occurrence of spontaneous breakdown of modular invariance . whether the fact is a defect or not , we need more deeper studies , however , we emphasize that the model still seems phenomenologically effective .",
    "the tachyonic state is rather a general feature of superstring inspired supergravity model @xcite .",
    "we should find satisfaction in our achievements , at this moment , that our model can well explain the inflation and just after the inflation ( preheating stage ) at phenomenological level .",
    "more detailed analysis will appear soon .",
    "though we have been exclusively restricted our attention to a model of ref.@xcite , the other models derived from the other type of compactification seems very interesting . among them",
    "kklt model @xcite attracts our interest , where the moduli superfield @xmath0 plays an essential roles .",
    "we should take all the circumstances into consideration on essential problems confronted in construction of ( no - scale ) supergravity models .",
