    "@xmath0  boo ( spectral type f7v ) is a remarkable object , not only because it hosts a giant planet orbiting very close to the star , but also because it is one of the few stars for which magnetic polarity reversals have been reported in the literature .",
    "so far , two polarity reversals have been detected @xcite , suggesting that it undergoes magnetic cycles similar to the sun , but with a period that is about one order of magnitude smaller than the solar one .",
    "the polarity reversals in @xmath0  boo seem to occur at a period of roughly one year , switching from a negative poloidal field near the visible pole in june-2006 @xcite to a positive poloidal field in june-2007 @xcite , and then back again to a negative polarity in july-2008 @xcite . at these three observing epochs , @xmath0",
    "boo presented a dominant poloidal field , but in between the last observed reversal ( more specifically , in january-2008 ) , the magnetic field of @xmath0  boo switched to a predominantly toroidal one .",
    "subsequent observations confirm that @xmath0  boo presents stable , periodic polarity reversals ( fares et al .",
    ", in prep ) , confirming the presence of a magnetic cycle with a duration of roughly 2 years .",
    "it is interesting to note that polarity reversals have been observed in other objects , but the confirmation of the presence of a cycle requires a long - term monitoring .",
    "observed the first polarity switch , mostly visible in the azimuthal component of the magnetic field , in the solar - mass star hd  190771 .",
    "later on , @xcite observed another polarity switch of hd  190771 .",
    "contrary to @xmath0  boo , the initial magnetic state of this object was not recovered , suggesting that the polarity reversals in hd  190771 does not take the form of a solar - type cycle .",
    "polarity reversals have also been reported in the other solar - type stars hd 78366 and @xmath13  boo  a @xcite , while the young star hr  1817 showed an `` attempted '' reversal in the azimuthal component of the magnetic field @xcite . in this case , rather than undergoing a reversal , the magnetic field strength decreased , but then strengthened with the same polarity @xcite .",
    "the nature of such a short magnetic cycle in @xmath0  boo remains an open question .",
    "differential rotation is thought to play an important role in the solar cycle .",
    "the fact that @xmath0  boo presents a much higher level of surface differential rotation than that of the sun may be responsible for its short observed cycle  boo @xcite . ] .",
    "in addition , @xmath0  boo also hosts a close - in planet that , due to its close proximity to the star , may have been able to synchronise , through tidal interactions , the rotation of the shallow convective envelope of the host star with the planetary orbital motion .",
    "this presumed synchronisation may enhance the shear at the tachocline , which may influence the magnetic cycle of the star @xcite .",
    "as the stellar winds of cool stars are magnetic by nature , variations of the stellar magnetic field during the cycle directly influences the outflowing wind .",
    "the solar wind , for instance , is dominated by high - speed flows outflowing from the coronal holes during and near the minimum phases of the solar cycle . as the solar cycle approaches its maximum ,",
    "the coronal holes become smaller and the high - speed flows narrow and weaken @xcite . in analogy to the sun , we expect that the stellar wind from @xmath0  boo will respond to variations in the magnetic properties of the star during its cycle .",
    "one of the goals of this present study is to quantify these variations .",
    "the solar magnetic cycle has a direct impact on the planets of the solar system .",
    "in particular at the earth , during periods of intense solar activity , geomagnetic storms can , e.g. , produce auroras , disrupt radio transmissions , affect power grids , and damage satellites orbiting the earth .",
    "likewise , the magnetic cycle of @xmath0  boo should affect any orbiting planet , especially if located at such a close distance as that of @xmath0  boo b ( @xmath14 from its host - star , * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , the planet s interaction with the host star wind may lead to planetary radio emission .",
    "radio emission has been detected in the giant planets of the solar system , in the earth and in a few satellites orbiting these planets @xcite .",
    "the auroral radio emission from the earth , for instance , is pumped ( primarily ) by reconnection events between the interplanetary magnetic field ( embedded in the solar wind ) and the planet s own magnetic field at the dayside magnetopause . on the other hand , the interaction of jupiter with its moon io , which also generates radio emission ,",
    "is thought to be caused by the satellite s motion inside the planet s magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "radio emission from exoplanets has been investigated by several authors .",
    "detection of the auroral radio signatures from exoplanets would consist of a direct planet - detection method , as opposed to the widely used indirect methods of radial velocity measurements or transit events .",
    "moreover , the detection of exoplanetary radio emission would comprise a way to assess the magnitude of planetary magnetic fields .",
    "however , despite many attempts , radio emission from exoplanets has not been detected so far .",
    "one of the reasons for the unsuccessful detection is attributed to the beamed nature of the electron - cyclotron maser instability , believed to be the process operating in the generation of radio emission .",
    "poor instrumental sensitivity is also pointed to as an explanation for the lack of detection of radio emission from exoplanets .",
    "another reason for the failure is often attributed to frequency mismatch : the emission process is thought to occur at cyclotron frequencies , which depend on the intensity of the planetary magnetic field .",
    "therefore , planets with magnetic field strengths of , e.g. , a few g would emit at a frequency that could be either unobserved from the ground due to the earth s ionospheric cut - off or that does not correspond to the operating frequencies of available instruments . in that regard , the low - operating frequency of lofar ( current under commissioning ) , jointly with its high sensitivity at this low - frequency range , makes it an instrument that has the potential to detect radio emission from exoplanets .",
    "a more thorough discussion about the non - detection of radio emission from exoplanets can be found in , e.g. , @xcite .      to quantify the effect the stellar cycle has on the orbiting planet , one has to understand the properties of the stellar wind , which depends on the particular geometry of the coronal magnetic field at each epoch during the stellar cycle .",
    "several works have studied the influence of the geometry of the coronal magnetic field on the stellar wind properties by means of numerical simulations . here , we implement the observationally - derived surface magnetic field of @xmath0  boo in our numerical model . in total , we use in the present study four surface magnetic maps derived at four different epochs : june-2006 , june-2007 , january-2008 , and july-2008 .",
    "these maps have been presented elsewhere @xcite and encompass ( at least ) one full cycle , with two polarity reversals in the poloidal field .    using the results of our stellar wind models",
    ", we then evaluate the radio flux emitted by @xmath0  boo  b , analogously to what is observed for the giant planets in the solar system .",
    "the radio emission is calculated at each observed epoch of the stellar magnetic cycle .",
    "we note that the @xmath0  boo system has been classified among the prime targets for radio emission detection based on models that consider more simplistic descriptions for the stellar wind",
    ". a more sophisticated model for the stellar wind , such as the one presented in this paper , will be useful to provide some interpretation of the radio emission when it is discovered .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : section  [ sec.wind ] presents the three - dimensional numerical model used in our simulations and describes the observed surface magnetic field distributions that are implemented in our model .",
    "section  [ sec.results_wind ] presents the results of our stellar wind modelling , and in section  [ sec.radio ] , we investigate planetary radio emission arising from the interaction between the stellar wind and the planet .",
    "section  [ sec.conc ] presents further discussion and the conclusions of our work .",
    "the lack of symmetry in the magnetic field distribution at the surface of @xmath0  boo requires the stellar wind equations to be solved in a fully three - dimensional geometry .",
    "our simulations make use of the three - dimensional mhd numerical code bats - r - us developed at university of michigan @xcite .",
    "bats - r - us has been widely used to simulate , e.g. , the earth s magnetosphere @xcite , the heliosphere @xcite , the outer - heliosphere @xcite , coronal mass ejections @xcite , and the magnetosphere of planets @xcite , among others .",
    "it solves the ideal mhd equations , that in the conservative form are given by @xmath15 @xmath16 = \\rho { \\bf g},\\ ] ] @xmath17 @xmath18 = \\rho { \\bf g}\\cdot { \\bf u } , \\ ] ] where the eight primary variables are the mass density @xmath19 , the plasma velocity @xmath20 , the magnetic field @xmath21 , and the gas pressure @xmath22 .",
    "the gravitational acceleration due to the star with mass @xmath23 and radius @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the total energy density given by @xmath27 we consider an ideal gas , so @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath30 is the temperature , @xmath31 is the particle number density of the stellar wind , @xmath32 is the mean mass of the particle , and @xmath33 is the polytropic index ( such that @xmath34 ) .          at the initial state of the simulations , we assume that the wind is thermally driven @xcite . at the base of the corona ( @xmath35 ) ,",
    "we adopt a wind coronal temperature @xmath36 , wind number density @xmath37 , and stellar rotation period @xmath38 .",
    "the values adopted in our simulations are shown in table  [ table_par ] .",
    "the values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 are from @xcite and @xmath38 from @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath36 we adopted represents a typical temperature of a stellar corona and @xmath37 is selected in such a way as to recover observed emission measure values ( see section  [ sec.results_wind ] ) . with this numerical setting ,",
    "the initial solution for the density , pressure ( or temperature ) and wind velocity profiles are fully specified .",
    "using the results of the stellar wind simulations , we proceed to evaluate the exoplanetary radio emission as shown in section  [ sec.radio ] .",
    "figure  [ fig.app_radio_flux ] shows the resultant radio flux emitted by a planet interacting with its host star s wind .",
    "the solid lines in figure  [ fig.app_radio_flux ] are labeled according to the assumption involved in the reconstruction of the stellar surface magnetic field .",
    "because in the unconstrained case , the reconstructed magnetic field in the unseen hemisphere has smaller intensities and is less structured than that in the visible hemisphere , the stellar wind in the unseen region is less influenced by the latitude - dependent magnetic forces and , therefore , is more spherical . as a consequence ,",
    "the exoplanetary radio emission are relatively ` flat ' for a range of colatitudes from @xmath39 onwards ( note that we omitted the region with @xmath40 in figures  [ fig.theta_shock ] and [ fig.radio ] due to the lack of information there ) .",
    "when the symmetric or anti - symmetric assumptions are imposed , the more complicated topology of the magnetic field is reflected in the radio flux calculated for @xmath41 , as can be seen in figure  [ fig.app_radio_flux ] ( compare blue and black lines against red one ) . in spite of that , there is no significant difference between the calculated radio fluxes ( symmetric : @xmath42  mjy , anti - symmetric : @xmath43  mjy , unconstrained : @xmath44  mjy ) .",
    "this suggests that the choice of the constraints adopted in the reconstruction of the surface magnetic field should not affect the results obtained in this paper .",
    "boo b ( july-2008 ) as a function of colatitude @xmath45 , which is related to the unknown orbital inclination .",
    "the planet is either assumed to have a magnetic field intensity similar to the earth ( right axis ) or similar to jupiter s ( left axis ) .",
    "red solid curve assumes no constraints in the reconstruction of the surface magnetic field ( red solid line in figure  [ fig.radio]d ) , blue solid curve assumes symmetry with respect to the centre of the star , and black solid curve assumes anti - symmetry .",
