    "linear water - wave theory is a widely - used approach that allows to determine the frequencies and modes of free oscillations of a liquid in a container .",
    "such oscillations exist provided the liquid s upper surface is free and , in the framework of this theory , one obtains their frequencies and modes from a mixed steklov problem .",
    "the latter involves a spectral parameter in the boundary condition on the free surface .",
    "this boundary value problem ( usually referred to as the sloshing problem ) has been the subject of a great number of studies over 250 years ( see @xcite for a historical review and @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for some of recent literature ) .",
    "it is also worth pointing out here that other steklov type eigenvalue problems have attracted considerable attention in last years .",
    "for some of these developments , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "recently , the question of the so - called ` high spots ' defined by sloshing eigenfunctions corresponding to the fundamental eigenvalue attracted the authors attention .",
    "this question is not only similar , but closely related to the long - standing ` hot spots ' conjecture of j. rauch .",
    "( it is worth mentioning that a substantial progress has been achieved in studies of this conjecture for the neumann laplacian during the past decade ; see , for example , the works @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . ) roughly speaking , the question about high spots concerns monotonicity properties of fundamental sloshing eigenfunctions ( see subsection 1.3 for a detailed description ) .",
    "several results about the location of high spots were proved in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "one of them deals with the fundamental eigenfunction ( it is unique up to a non - zero factor ) of the two - dimensional sloshing problem in the case when the domain s top interval is the one - to - one orthogonal projection of the bottom .",
    "the other one treat fundamental eigenfunctions in troughs ( their cross - sections are subject to the same condition ) , and some vertical axisymmetric containers .",
    "moreover , it was shown in @xcite that for vertical - walled containers with horizontal bottom the question about high spots is equivalent to the hot spots conjecture .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the location of high spots for fundamental eigenfunctions satisfying the three - dimensional sloshing problem in axially symmetric domains of rather general shape .",
    "it occurs that the method , which can be briefly characterised as the method of domain s deformation ( it was developed by d. jerison and n. nadirashvili in @xcite in order to prove the hot spots conjecture for domains with two axes of symmetry ) is adaptable for our purpose .",
    "the result demonstrating that eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the sloshing problem depend continuously on the domain deformation are of interest in itself .",
    "first we formulate the three - dimensional sloshing problem in its general form .",
    "let an inviscid , incompressible , heavy liquid occupy a three - dimensional container bounded from above by a free surface , which in its mean position is a simply connected two - dimensional domain of finite diameter .",
    "let cartesian coordinates @xmath2 be chosen so that the mean free surface lies in the @xmath3-plane and the @xmath4-axis is directed upwards .",
    "the surface tension is neglected on the free surface , and we assume the liquid motion to be irrotational and of small amplitude .",
    "the latter assumption allows us to linearise boundary conditions on the free surface and this leads to the following boundary value problem for @xmath8  the velocity potential of the flow with a time - harmonic factor removed : @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the domain which is supposed to be a bounded lipschitz domain .",
    "the boundary @xmath11 consists of a two - dimensional domain @xmath12 referred to as the free surface ( we assume that @xmath13 is a bounded lipschitz domain ) and @xmath14 , the rigid container s bottom . in the whole paper",
    "we will refer to a domain @xmath1 with the above geometric properties as to a _",
    "liquid domain_. throughout the article , @xmath15 denotes the normal derivative at @xmath11 , which is well - defined for almost every ( with respect to the surface measure ) point of @xmath11 .",
    "we understand that @xmath16 is a continuous function on @xmath17 , and that ( [ nc ] ) is satisfied for all points on @xmath18 for which @xmath15 is defined .",
    "we remark that in condition , the coefficient @xmath19 is the spectral parameter which involves the radian frequency @xmath20 of liquid s oscillations and the acceleration due to gravity @xmath21 .",
    "the zero eigenvalue obviously exists for the problem  , but we exclude it with the help of the following orthogonality condition : @xmath22 it has been known since the 1950s that the problem  has a discrete spectrum ; that is , there exists a sequence of eigenvalues @xmath23 each having a finite multiplicity equal to the number of repetitions in , and such that @xmath24 as @xmath25 .",
    "these eigenvalues can be found by means of the variational principle ( see , for example , @xcite ) , corresponding to the following rayleigh quotient : @xmath26 } { \\int_{f } { { \\varphi}}^2 } , \\label{rq}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is in the sobolev space @xmath27 and satisfies  .",
    "thus @xmath28 is equal to the minimum of this quotient over the subspace of the sobolev space @xmath29 which consists of functions satisfying  ; the corresponding eigenfunction delivers the value @xmath28 to the quotient .",
    "the eigenfunctions @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) belong to @xmath29 and form a complete system in an appropriate hilbert space ( see , for example , @xcite ) .       obtained as rotation of a domain @xmath32 .",
    "( b ) a domain @xmath32 . ]",
    "now we turn to the problem of sloshing in axisymmetric containers .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the cylindrical coordinates @xmath33 so that @xmath34 and to take the @xmath4-axis as the axis of symmetry for @xmath1 . in this case",
    "@xmath13 is typically a disc on @xmath35-plane ( see figure  [ fig:1](a ) ) .",
    "moreover , we will consider @xmath1 as obtained by rotation of a domain @xmath32 adjacent to both axes in the @xmath36-plane .",
    "for such liquid domains , we write @xmath37 .",
    "it is convenient to think of @xmath32 as the cross - sections of @xmath1 along the half - plane @xmath38 .",
    "by @xmath39 and @xmath40 we denote the cross - sections of @xmath13 and @xmath18 , respectively , while @xmath41 is the part of @xmath42 located on the @xmath4-axis ( see figure  [ fig:1](b ) ) .",
    "it is clear that the ansatz @xmath43 where @xmath44 is bounded near @xmath41 , reduces the eigenvalue problem ( [ lap])([ort ] ) in @xmath1 to the following sequence of boundary value problems : @xmath45 these relations must hold for all @xmath46 , and by  , for @xmath47 we also have that @xmath48 the above reduction was applied by many authors , see , in particular , @xcite , @xcite , ( * ? ?",
    "? * formulas  ( 13 ) , ( 14 ) ) .",
    "the variational method guarantees that for every @xmath49 , the spectral problem ( [ lapd])([ortd ] ) has a sequence of eigenvalues @xmath50 and by @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , we denote the double sequence of corresponding eigenfunctions .",
    "every eigenvalue in ( [ meigenvalues ] ) has a finite multiplicity equal to the number of repetitions ; moreover , for every @xmath54 we have that @xmath55 as @xmath56 .",
    "it is clear that , the sequence of eigenvalues @xmath57 of problem ( [ lap])([ort ] ) for @xmath1 coincides with the double sequence @xmath58 , with every number @xmath59 repeated twice when @xmath60 .",
    "thus the sequence of problems ( [ lapd])([ortd ] ) is equivalent to the original sloshing problem .",
    "we need the following definition .",
    "we say that a liquid domain @xmath1 satisfies _ the john condition _ when @xmath61 .",

    "then @xmath72 for any other eigenfunction @xmath5 corresponding to @xmath28 there is a change of @xmath73 coordinates by a rotation around @xmath4-axis so that @xmath5 is odd in @xmath7 variable .",
    "the third part of the theorem has the following hydrodynamical meaning .",
    "if liquid oscillates freely with the fundamental frequency @xmath28 then at every moment the free - surface elevation of liquid is proportional to the fundamental eigenfunction @xmath74 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if we assume that @xmath68 is odd in @xmath7 variable then the elevation is increasing along each line parallel to @xmath7 axis during one half - period of liquid oscillation and decreasing during the other half - period .",
    "in particular when the free surface is @xmath75 then the elevation has its maximum at @xmath76 and minimum at @xmath77 during one half - period of oscillation , whereas during the other half - period the maximum and minimum values exchange places with one another .",
    "this is the reason to call this property the ` high spots ' theorem .",
    "one could ask whether the assumption that @xmath1 satisfies the john condition is necessary in theorem [ th : mainconvex ] .",
    "it occurs that if @xmath1 does not satisfy the john condition then the monotonicity property of @xmath78 does not necessarily hold .",
