    "with the discovery of superconductivity in @xmath0 at about @xmath11 by akimitsu and co - workers,@xcite there is an opportunity to study superfluid transport and phase locking of conduction electrons in a whole new class of materials . in early studies of the @xmath12 isotope effect,@xcite budko and",
    "co - workers found the superconducting transition temperature , @xmath5 , increased from @xmath13 for @xmath14 to @xmath15 for @xmath16 giving a partial isotope exponent @xmath17 for the isotope relation @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the isotope mass .",
    "this is a clear indication that the phonons are playing an important role in the superconducting interaction .",
    "in addition , band structure calculations@xcite indicate a rather isotropic electrical transport in spite of the very layered appearance of honeycombed boron and hexagonal magnesium networks in the material .    the purpose of this letter is to report measurements of the critical fields of this material to get an estimate of the characteristic length and energy scales for comparison with the classical superconductors like nb and the high temperature superconductors , like @xmath20 .",
    "a second goal is to obtain some measure of the supercurrent transport through grain boundaries for comparison with the high temperature superconductors where there are serious weak link problems with the grain boundaries .",
    "a sintered pellet of @xmath16 was made by sealing a stoichiometric mixture of @xmath21 and @xmath22 in a ta tube and heating to @xmath23 for two hours.@xcite magnetization was measured with a quantum designs squid magnetometer with a @xmath24 scan length on a @xmath25 piece from the same batch of @xmath16 material reported previously.@xcite electrical resistance between @xmath26 and @xmath27 in applied magnetic field up to @xmath28 was measured in a quantum designs ppms-9 apparatus on another piece from the same @xmath16 batch using standard four probe ac resistance technique at @xmath29 and a current density of @xmath30 .",
    "electrical contacts were made with epo - tek @xmath31 silver epoxy .",
    "the temperature dependent electrical resistance of the material from @xmath27 to @xmath26 , shown in fig .",
    "1 , roughly obeys @xmath32 power law in the normal state .",
    "the residual resistance ratio ( rrr ) is approximately @xmath33 , which is relatively high for a sintered polycrystalline sample . near @xmath5 ,",
    "the data show considerable flux - flow broadening as shown by the inset in fig . 1 where the scans range from @xmath34 to @xmath28 .",
    "transition widths gradually broaden from @xmath35 at @xmath34 field to @xmath36 at @xmath37 indicating a broad region of flux - flow resistivity.@xcite the extent of this flux - flow regime is delineated by the onset and completion temperatures shown in fig . 2 by the vertical dash lines .",
    "possibly the most interesting aspect of these data is the strong magnetoresistance which shows the resistance at @xmath38 rising approximately @xmath39 percent in @xmath28 . if these data are plotted on a kohler plot shown in fig .",
    "3 , the @xmath40 curve is a straight line for the change of temperature at constant field ( open circles ) and for changing field at constant temperature ( solid triangles ) . this observation is consistent with the observed magnetoresistance being a band effect and intrinsic to the sample .",
    "magnetization data are exemplified by the @xmath41 and @xmath42 runs in fig.4 . for the @xmath42 run",
    ", the magnetization abruptly departs from the background at @xmath43 and is reversible to an accuracy of one percent of the magnetization down to @xmath44 . because the background magnetization is very small , linear in magnetic field , and independent of temperature between @xmath45 and @xmath46 , this correction",
    "is easily made and @xmath1 and @xmath47 are fairly easy to measure . at @xmath48 , the magnitude of the background is about @xmath49 and the correction can be made to an accuracy of @xmath50 .",
    "the inset shows that the irreversible magnetization over a fuller temperature range . in the inset ,",
    "the x - symbols show the @xmath42 data and show that about @xmath51 or about @xmath52 flux is trapped at zero field . at @xmath53 , shown by the solid squares of the inset , the trapped flux at zero applied field for this rather porous granular pellet is @xmath54 or over @xmath55 .    using the bean@xcite model with @xmath56 , the critical current densities of fig .",
    "5 can be derived . here",
    ", @xmath8 is in @xmath57 , @xmath58 in @xmath59 , and the sample radius , @xmath60 , in @xmath61 .",
    "these @xmath8 values are not as high as a sintered pellet of @xmath10,@xcite but the grain - to - grain supercurrent coupling is rather promising .",
    "a scanning electron microscope picture of a fracture surface of the pellet shows grain size running from about @xmath62 to @xmath63 .",
    "the grains are somewhat faceted plates and many small grains are equiaxed . from the magnitude of the measured screening currents ,",
    "it is clear that the proper @xmath60 to put in the bean model is the full sample diameter and not the grain size .",
    "the sample radius is about @xmath64 .",
    "close to @xmath5 , there is a reasonable range of thermodynamic reversibility , so an estimate has been made of @xmath65 vs. @xmath66 . to do this , it is assumed that the flux pinning in decreasing magnetic field is the same as in increasing magnetic field and an equilibrium magnetization is defined as the average of the average of the increasing field magnetization and the decreasing field magnetization by @xmath67 .",
    "willemin and co - workers@xcite have shown the validity of this procedure .",
    "a plot of @xmath68 in fig.6 shows behavior close to that predicted by abrikosov.@xcite integrating the area under these magnetization curves gives the @xmath69 curve shown in the inset of fig .",
    "6 . from the slope of @xmath70",
    ", one can calculate the jump in specific heat at @xmath5 to be @xmath71[dh_c / dt]^2=79~mj / mole~k$ ] .",
    "this is consistent with the direct specific heat measurements published earlier@xcite from which @xmath72 can be estimated to be about @xmath73 .",
    "the transport and magnetization studies of @xmath16 give very consistent measures of @xmath74 for this material with magnetization data giving a slope at @xmath5 of @xmath2 .",
    "the magnetization @xmath1 agrees with the onset of the resistive transition , and the broadened resistive transitions seem to reflect a flux - flow resistivity phenomenon .",
    "close to @xmath5 , the values of the @xmath65 can be estimated and the slope is found to be @xmath75 .",
    "this then means that the ginsburg - landau parameter , @xmath76\\simeq 26 $ ] . by estimating @xmath77_{t_c}$ ] to be @xmath78",
    ", the low temperature coherence distance , @xmath79^{1/2}$ ] is found to be @xmath80 . using the relation @xmath81 , the penetration depth , @xmath82 .",
    "the critical current densities for this rather porous sintered sample are on the order of @xmath9 at @xmath53 .",
    "this would seem to indicate that @xmath0 grain boundaries can transmit rather large supercurrents .",
