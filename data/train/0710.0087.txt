    "electron transport in layered metals exhibits a qualitatively different behavior of the in - plane @xmath0 and out - of - plane ( @xmath1 resistivities : whereas the temperature dependence of @xmath2 is metallic - like , that of @xmath3 is either insulating - like or even non - monotonic .",
    "this behavior is observed in various materials , such as high - temperature superconductors @xcite , sodium and bismuth cobaltate oxides @xcite , the layered perovskite sr@xmath4ruo@xmath5@xcite , dichalogenides @xcite , graphite @xcite , organic metals @xcite , and other systems .",
    "it is quite remarkable that the @xmath6-axis resistivity behaves similarly in materials with otherwise drastically different properties , ranging from weakly ( graphite ) to strongly ( sr@xmath4ruo@xmath5 ) correlated fermi liquids and then to non - fermi liquids ( htc , cobaltate oxides ) , and with fermi energies spanning the interval from a few ev ( in most layered metals ) to @xmath7 mev ( in graphite ) .",
    "also , the magnitude of @xmath3 varies from a few m@xmath8 cm ( e.g. , in sr@xmath4ruo@xmath9 to a few @xmath10 cm ( e.g. , in organics and ( bi@xmath11pb@xmath12)@xmath4sr@xmath13co@xmath4o@xmath14 .",
    "the great variety of systems and associated energy scales suggests that the origin of this effect is not related to the specific properties of any of the compounds but rather to what they have in common , i.e. , strong anisotropy . at the level of non - interacting electrons , layered systems",
    "are metals with strongly anisotropic fermi surfaces .",
    "a simple but instructive model is that of free motion along the layers and nearest - neighbor hopping between the layers . in this model ,",
    "the single - particle spectrum is @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are in the in - plane and @xmath6-axis components of the momentum , respectively , @xmath18 is the in - plane mass , @xmath19 is the hopping matrix element in the @xmath6-axis direction , and @xmath20 is the lattice constant in the same direction .",
    "strong mass anisotropy is guaranteed by the condition @xmath21.(we set @xmath22 through the rest of the paper . ) for @xmath23 the fermi surface is closed ( as it is in graphite ) ; for @xmath24 the fermi surface is open ( as it is in the majority of layered materials ) . for weakly coupled layers ( @xmath25 the equipotential surfaces are `` corrugated cylinders '' with slight modulation along the @xmath6-axis ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "transport in metals is commonly described via the boltzmann equation for the distribution function of electrons ( @xmath26 in the phase space . to study the linear response conductivity ,",
    "it is sufficient to consider a weak electric field . in this case ,",
    "@xmath27 , where the non - equilibrium correction @xmath28 to the fermi function @xmath29 satisfies @xmath30=-\\frac{\\partial f_{0}}{\\partial \\epsilon } e\\mathbf{v\\cdot } % \\mathbf{e}\\,.\\ ] ] here @xmath31 is a linearized collision integral and @xmath32 .",
    "the tensor of the @xmath33 electrical conductivity is given by @xmath34 where the integration goes over the brillouin zone .",
    "for all known types of the inelastic interaction ( electron - phonon , electron - electron , electron - magnon , etc . )",
    ", the operator @xmath35 decreases with the temperature ; thus all components of the conductivity tensor must decrease with @xmath36 as well ( although the particular forms of the @xmath36 dependence may be different for different components ) .",
    "this is not what the experiment shows .",
    "= 0.6=0.7    the situation when bolztmann equation fails so dramatically is rather unusual , given that other examples of its breakdown , e.g. , weak localization and altshuler - aronov effects in the conductivity , indicate some non - trivial quantum interference effects . the fact that this breakdown occurs only in the @xmath6-direction , makes the situation even more puzzling .",
    "a vast amount of literature , addressing various aspects of this problem , is accumulated at this point .",
    "the proposed models can be roughly divided in two groups .",
    "the first group is trying to find the explanation of the anomalous @xmath6-axis transport within a model of an anisotropic metal in which an electron interacts with potential impurities , phonons , and/or other electrons .",
    "the breakdown of the boltzmann equation is associated either with anderson localization in the @xmath6 ( but not in the in - plane ) direction or from the `` coherent - incoherent crossover '' , which is believed to occur when the tunneling time between the layers ( @xmath37 ) becomes longer than the inelastic time ( @xmath38 ) @xcite or the thermal time ( @xmath39 ) @xcite , i.e. , when @xmath40 however , as far as anderson localization is concerned , it was shown that it occurs only for exponentially small @xmath19 [ @xmath41 where @xmath42 the elastic scattering time ] and then only simultaneously in all directions @xcite .",
    "the breakdown of the boltzmann equation due to the coherent - incoherent crossover for the electron - phonon interaction has been reconsidered in our recent paper @xcite , where we have shown that the prange - kadanoff derivation of the boltzmann equation @xcite applies equally well to the anisotropic case .",
    "the only condition for the validity of the boltzmann equation for both isotropic and anisotropic cases is the large value of the `` dimensionless conductance '' @xmath43 , where @xmath38 is the inelastic scattering time , regardless of whether @xmath44 is large or small , provided that the migdal parameter @xmath45 ( @xmath46 is the sound velocity ) is small over the entire fermi surface , which is the case for fermi surfaces of the type shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fs ] .",
    "this argument can be readily extended to any situation when the self - energy is local , i.e. , independent of the electron s momentum , and applies not only to fermi liquids but also to non - fermi liquids .",
    "therefore , for a large class of non - perturbative interactions the coherent - incoherent crossover does not occur , and the @xmath6-axis resistivity is supposed to maintain its metallic character . on the experimental side ,",
    "the existence of the coherent - incoherent crossover has been questioned by a recent observation of angular magneto resistance oscillations in a layered organic metal @xcite well above the temperature of the expected crossover . moreover , the coherent - incoherent crossover on its own does not account for a non - metallic conductivity , as in this scenario the conductivities in both the coherent and incoherent regimes are proportional to the same scattering time @xcite,@xcite and thus exhibit a metallic @xmath36 dependence .    along a similar line of reasoning ,",
    "it was suggested that the non - metallic @xmath6-axis transport is related to the fermi - to - non - fermi - liquid crossover ( understood as a smearing of the quasiparticle peak in the spectral function ) , which occurs at high enough temperatures in some materials @xcite .",
    "indeed , the angle - resolved photoemission experiments on sodium and bismuth cobaltate oxides show that the temperature at which the quasiparticle peak is smeared is of the same order as temperature @xmath47 at which @xmath3 exhibits a maximum @xcite .",
    "although this coincidence is suggestive , it runs against the prange - kadanoff argument @xcite which shows that the existence of quasiparticles is _ not _ a pre - requisite for boltzmann - like transport . also , it is not clear at the moment whether the relation between smearing of the quasi - particle peak and the maximum in @xmath3 is common for all materials .",
    "for example , @xmath47 in the hopg graphite is low enough ( @xmath48 k ) @xcite , so that quasiparticles are still well - defined at @xmath49 .",
    "finally , the model of fermi - to - non - fermi - liquid crossover on its own does not account for the anomalous transport , especially given that the in - plane resistivity shows no dramatic signs of this crossover .",
    "within the first group is also the polaron model @xcite @xcite , which is capable of a quantitative description of the experiment , given that polarons are stable .",
    "the latter assumption , however , requires a very strong anisotropy of the phonon spectrum , which needs to be more anisotropic than the electron one , which is not the case at least in some representative materials , e.g. , in sr@xmath4ruo@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "finally , there is an explanation based on the zero - bias anomaly in tunneling between the layers , resulting from a suppression of the single - particle density of states of in - plane electrons , e.g. , via a pseudogap mechanism in high @xmath50 cuprates @xcite,@xcite .",
    "however , the zero - bias mechanism is only valid on the incoherent side of the coherent - incoherent crossover which , as we argued earlier , does not occur for a large class of interaction .",
    "the second group assumes that the primary reason of the anomalous behavior of the @xmath6-axis resistivity is transport through inter - plane defects .",
    "the temperature dependence is introduced either phenomenologically @xcite , @xcite or through thermal occupation of electron states in the conducting layers @xcite , or else , as it was done in the short version of this paper @xcite , through a phonon - assisted tunneling . whether inter - plane disorder is the reason for the anomalous @xmath6-axis transport in all layered materials is not clear at the moment . currently , there is a number of observations pointing at the role of inter - plane disorder as a mediator of @xmath6-axis transport .",
    "for example , recent experiment @xcite has shown that the radiation damage of an organic metal _ reduces _ rather then increases @xmath51 at temperatures around @xmath52 also , variability of @xmath3 in graphite samples prepared in different ways ( including the natural ones ) provides an indirect argument for the role of inter - plane disorder .",
    "it seems worthwhile to explore the consequences of a model involving inter - plane disorder and this what we will do in this paper .",
    "we assume that , in addition to normal impurities , a layered crystal also contains a number of resonant impurities located in the inter - planar space .",
    "an electron moves between the layers via two mechanisms : the first one is direct tunneling , augmented by scattering at normal ( non - resonant ) impurities , phonons , etc . , and the second one is resonant tunneling through defect sites .",
    "direct tunneling between the layers forms a band state smeared by various scattering processes , which include the non - resonant part of scattering by inter - plane defects .",
    "transport of these states is described by the boltzmann conductivity @xmath53 which has a metallic temperature dependence .",
    "as resonant tunneling opens a new channel of conduction , the total conductivity can be described by a phenomenological formula @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the resonant - impurity contribution.on the other hand , the in - plane conductivity remains largely unaffected by inter - plane disorder , so that @xmath56 regardless of a particular tunneling mechanism , the resonant part @xmath55 increases with @xmath36 .",
    "consequently , the band channel , which is weak to begin with due to a small value of the inter - plane transfer @xmath57 is short - circuited by the resonant one at high enough temperatures .",
    "accordingly , @xmath58 goes through a minimum at a certain temperature ( and @xmath59 goes through a maximum ) .",
    "more generally , @xmath3 may exhibit a variety of behaviors , discussed in sec.[comparison ] in this paper , we develop a microscopic theory of resonant tunneling through a wide band of energy levels positioned randomly in between two conducting layers and coupled to a fluctuating field of bosonic excitations ( sec.[sec : gen ] ) .",
    "two particular examples of such a field , considered here , are phonons and the dynamic coulomb field of all conduction electrons in a crystal .",
    "the case of phonon - assisted tunneling through a single junction was considered before in refs .  [ ] .",
    "our formalism reproduces the general results of refs .",

    "this prediction is important for discriminating the phonon - assisted mechanism against other effects .",
    "a strong on - site coulomb interaction was shown to result in a kondo anomaly in the tunneling conductance @xcite .",
    "the effect of the coulomb interaction between on - site and conduction electrons was considered by matveev and larkin @xcite in the context of a threshold singularity in the non - linear current - voltage characteristic , observed in ref .",

    ", we neglect the effects of interference between different resonant centers , as well as between resonant and non - resonant scattering . tunneling through more than one impurity",
    "was considered theoretically in and observed experimentally in thick ( @xmath69 nm ) tunneling junctions @xcite , but it is less likely to occur in tunneling through thin ( @xmath70 nm ) inter - plane spacings , so we will disregard such a possibility here .",

    "we assume that the potential localizing the electron is of a short range and therefore , when the site is empty , it does not affect the motion of conduction electrons .",
    "this situation is different from that considered in the context of the fermi edge singularity in resonant tunneling @xcite , where the coulomb field of the empty , charged site scatters conduction electrons .",
    "we also assume that the on - site coulomb repulsion is so large that the double occupancy of the resonant center is forbidden , and the spin degree of freedom does not play any role in tunneling .",

    "however , one of the factors of @xmath185 is replaced by @xmath214 in the diffusive limit ( @xmath215 , and the subleading term becomes larger than the leading , linear - in-@xmath185 term .",

    "the corresponding conductivity @xmath225 increases with temperature faster than any power - law .",
    "interestingly , the temperature dependence of the resonant conductivity is similar to that of the zero - bias anomaly ( zba ) in the 2d diffusive case@xcite .",
    "the difference between the two results is in the dimensionless parameters : the dimensionless conductance , @xmath226 that controls zba , is replaced by @xmath227 for the resonant tunneling case .    for frequencies smaller than @xmath228 , cf .",
    "eq.[[omega_1 ] ] , typical @xmath188 s are large , which means the diffusion approximation breaks down again and the ballistic one should be used instead .",
    "we thus conclude that the resonant tunneling conductivity is given by the diffusive limit [ eq.([sigma_d ] ) ] for temperatures in the interval @xmath229 and by the ballistic limit [ eq.([sigma_b ] ) ] for the rest of the temperatures .",
    "several comments are in order .",
    "i ) formally speaking , the power - law scaling of the electron - assisted tunneling conductivity in the ballistic regime [ eq.([sigma_b ] ) ] saturates for @xmath230 .",
    "the value at saturation is the same as for the electron - phonon case : @xmath231 however , @xmath203 is of order of the plasma frequency , so that the electron - assisted mechanism of tunneling leads to a growth of conductivity for all reasonable temperatures .",
    "this feature may be used in experiment to separate the electron- and phonon - assisted mechanism : because the saturation temperature for the phonon mechanism may be not too high , the growth of the total conductivity up to the highest temperatures is indicative of the electron - assisted mechanism .",
    "\\ii ) in contrast to the case of the interaction corrections to tunneling and transport conductivities in the ballistic regime @xcite , which are determined by the interaction on a large spatial scale ( of order of the ballistic thouless length @xmath232 ) , the electron - assisted tunneling conductivity is determined by the interaction at small distances ( of order of the screening radius ) . at these distances ,",
    "the rpa works only for weak interactions , i.e. , for @xmath233 and eq.([sigma_b ] ) is valid , strictly speaking , only in the perturbative regime .",
    "it is reasonable to assume , however , that if the interaction is not weak , the tunneling exponent in eq.([sigma_b ] ) is replaced by a non - universal quantity of order unity .",
    "\\iii ) in a real system , both assisted mechanisms  the electron - phonon and electron - electron ones - operate simultaneously . as we have explained",
    "before , the electron - phonon interaction is strong while the electron - electron one must be considered to be weak .",
    "to the extent that one can neglect the mutual influence of these two interactions , the total spectral function in eq.([a5 ] ) is a sum of two contributions @xmath234 since @xmath235 one can expand the total conductivity @xmath236 to first order in @xmath237 which yields @xmath238 where @xmath148 is the electron - phonon contribution given by eq.([cc7 ] ) . ignoring the logarithmic temperature dependence and using the low - temperature result for @xmath148 [ first line in eq.([cc7 ] ) ]",
    ", one sees that the electron - electron contribution dominates over the electron phonon - one for temperatures below a characteristic temperature @xmath239 using eq.([lambda ] ) for @xmath240 estimating @xmath196 as @xmath241 and also the deformation - potential constant as @xmath242 where @xmath243 is the atomic mass and @xmath122 is the lattice constant , we obtain @xmath244 k. for temperatures above @xmath245 but below the saturation temperature for the electron - phonon mechanism @xmath246 the electron - phonon mechanism dominates . for @xmath247",
    "the electron - electron interaction wins over again .",
    "once the electron - electron mechanism becomes the dominant one , the logarithms following the lowest order one in eq.([total ] ) can be summed up into a power law .",
    "therefore , a signature for the electron - electron mechanism is a power - law scaling of the conductivity ( with an exponent of order unity ) both at low and high temperatures , combined with an absence of saturation at high temperatures , as it was explained in item i ) of this section .",
    "the power - law increase of the conductivity with an exponent close to one has been observed in graphite both at low and high temperatures @xcite .",
    "\\iv ) another mechanism , competing with those considered in this paper , is the zero - bias anomaly ( zba ) , i.e. , the interaction corrections to the tunneling density of states .",
    "this mechanism leads to the temperature dependence of the resonant tunneling conductivity via the temperature dependence of the tunneling widths even in the absence of assisted processes .",
    "the interaction correction to the tunneling density of states for a 2d electron system can be divided into parts .",
    "the first contribution , @xmath248 is determined by the interaction of electrons in the absence of impurities @xcite . in a layered metal , @xmath249 is energy - independent for @xmath250 below the plasmon gap @xcite , which can be safely assumed to be the case , so @xmath251 does not contribute to the @xmath36-dependence of the tunneling conductivity . the second contribution",
    ", @xmath252 comes from the interplay of electron - electron and electron impurity scatterings . in the perturbation theory , @xmath253 is proportional to the inverse dimensionless conductance , @xmath254 times the logarithmic function of @xmath250 @xcite both in the ballistic and diffusive limits . on the other hand , the electron - assisted tunneling conductivity in the ballistic regime [ eq.([sigma_b ] ) ] allows for an expansion in @xmath255 therefore , the electron - assisted mechanism wins over the zba one if @xmath196 is not too small : @xmath256 in the diffusive regime , the electron - assisted and zba mechanisms are , generally speaking , of the same order .",

    "in this model , the @xmath36 dependence of the tunneling conductivity is insulating - like for @xmath259 and metallic - like for @xmath260 however , averaging over the energy levels eliminates the @xmath36-dependence .",

    "the most remarkable behavior is the one with a maximum in @xmath279 whereas the insulating upturns can , in principle , be ascribed to phase transitions , which open gaps over the parts of the fermi surface , the metallic behavior of @xmath280 at low temperatures shows unambiguously that we are dealing with a well - defined metallic state .",
