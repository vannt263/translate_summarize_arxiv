    "the microscopic understanding of smart polymer conformations in a mixture of solvents is scientifically challenging @xcite and , at the same time , possesses great technological implications that span over a broad range of disciplines @xcite .",
    "therefore , establishing the links between smart polymer conformations and its specific interactions is a key to develop any fundamental understanding of their solubility .",
    "examples of the most commonly known smart polymers include : poly(n - isopropylacrylamide ) ( pnipam ) , poly(n - isopropylmethacrylamide ) ( pnipmam ) , poly(n , n - diethylacrylamide ) ( pdeam ) , poly(n - vinlycaprolactam ) ( pvcl ) , and poly(acryloyl - l - proline methyl ester ) ( papome ) .",
    "when some of these polymers are dissolved in a mixture of solvents , such as aqueous alcohol solutions , they show a puzzling coil - globule - coil scenario @xcite .",
    "this interesting phenomenon is termed as co - non - solvency .",
    "theoretical understanding of these complex phenomena is mostly restricted to a limited number of computer simulation studies @xcite , which usually deal with chemically specific details @xcite . moreover",
    ", these simulations require careful parameterization of force fields that can be cumbersome , if their are rather delicate differences in interactions .",
    "however , in this context , if a physical phenomenon can be characterized within a universal concept , such that the chemical details only contribute to a pre - factor , then the correct physics can be captured with a rather simple generic model .",
    "the use of generic schemes has several advantages ; 1 ) the parameter space is not restricted to a specific system , unlike the all - atom simulations , and a broad range of systems can be represented within a unified simulation protocol , 2 ) the time scale of simulations are not of concern , and 3 ) because of the absence of any competing energy scales , one does not need an advanced molecular dynamics scheme . in this context",
    ", we have recently shown that the complexity of smart polymers can be captured within a generic model @xcite . using a simple model we could quantitatively capture the reentrant coil - globule - coil scenario of pnipam @xcite and papome @xcite in aqueous methanol mixtures .",
    "our analysis suggested that when two competing and individually good solvents are mixed together , because of the preferential binding of the better of the two ( co)solvents with the polymer , it collapses within the intermediate solution compositions . at a low cosolvent concentration",
    ", the cosolvent molecules can bind to two distinctly far monomers forming bridges and leading to polymer collapse .",
    "when the concentration of the better cosolvent is increased , they decorate the whole polymer and the polymer opens up .",
    "these results are in good agreement with the simulations incorporating all atom details @xcite and experiments @xcite .",
    "this coil - globule - coil scenario is a generic effect and many polymers are expected to exhibit similar behavior as long as one of the solvents is significantly better than the other .",
    "thus the behavior is not strictly restricted to the so called smart polymers exhibiting a lcst . in table",
    "[ tab : cns ] we present a list of polymers that show co - non - solvency effect .",
    "it is interesting to note that well known standard polymers , such as poly(ethylene oxide ) ( peo ) and polystyrene , also show co - no - solvency @xcite .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : cns ]    another example may include polymeric semiconductors @xcite that show anomalous viscosity with solvent composition , suggesting a change in polymer conformation .",
    "one of the most intriguing aspects of the co - non - solvency effect is that the solvent quality becomes increasingly better by the addition of the better cosolvent .",
    "thus the polymer collapses in a good solvent , making the solvent quality decoupled from the polymer conformation .",
    "this is very striking and against the conventional view on polymer solutions . while the atomistic simulations @xcite clearly demonstrate that the solvent becomes increasingly better by the addition of better cosolvent , it is still difficult to identify the preferred local coordination and especially the bridging .",
    "in contrast , generic simulations give a clear microscopic understanding of this complex phenomenon within a simple simulation protocol @xcite .",
    "complementary to that computer simulations give a good microscopic picture of the polymer collapse transitions , it is also advantageous to devise a general analytical theory consistent with the findings known from computer simulations and/or experiments .",
    "moreover , because of the complexity of the system interactions , this discrete particle based phenomenon can not be explained using a flory - huggins type mean - field picture .",
    "instead , these complex conformational transitions can be explained within a langmuir - like thermodynamic treatment of competitive displacement of different solvent components onto the polymer @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we revisit the co - non - solvency effect of smart polymers in the mixtures of solvents .",
    "we extend the analysis of our previous work @xcite to better understand the microscopic picture of co - non - solvency .",
    "we will present an in - depth argument to show that the mean - field theory is highly unsuitable for these systems and the conceptual need of a discrete particle - based theory .",
    "we also propose a phase diagram to identify the conformational states of smart polymers in various bulk solutions and with the change of cosolvent concentrations .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : method ] the generic molecular dynamics simulation details are presented .",
    "results and the theoretical arguments are presented in section [ sec : results ] and we finally present our conclusions in section [ sec : con ] .",
    "we start by briefly describing the details of the generic molecular simulations .",
    "a similar model has been used in our earlier study .",
    "a detailed description of model and method is presented in ref .",
    "a polymer @xmath0 is modeled using the well known bead - spring polymer model @xcite . in this model , individual monomers of a polymer interact with each other via a repulsive 6 - 12 lennard - jones ( lj ) potential ( wca potential ) .",
    "additionally , adjacent monomers in a polymer are connected via a finitely extensible nonlinear elastic potential ( fene ) . here",

    "all units are expressed in terms of the lj energy @xmath4 , the lj radius @xmath5 , and the mass @xmath6 of individual particles .",
    "this leads to a time unit of @xmath7 .",
    "the parameters of the potential are such that a reasonably large time step can be chosen , while bond crossing remains essentially forbidden .",
    "a bead - spring polymer is solvated in mixed solutions composed of two components also modeled as lj beads , solvent @xmath8 and cosolvent @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "since the solvent molecules typically are much smaller than the monomers of pnipam and/or papome in aqueous methanol , we choose the sizes of ( co)solvents to be @xmath10 .",
    "note that because of the reduced size of ( co)solvents , the corresponding number density within the simulation domain should also be adjusted such that the overall pressure remains @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath13 interactions are chosen such that @xmath9 is always a better solvent than @xmath8 . in our earlier study @xcite ,",
    "the default system consisted of a repulsive @xmath12 interaction , while @xmath13 interaction was attractive . in this work",
    ", we generalize this and investigate the effect of assymetry in interaction energies , when both @xmath12 and @xmath13 are attractive with interactions @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "additionally , we impose conditions ; ( 1 ) @xmath16 , ( 2 ) @xmath17 and @xmath18 . temperature is set to @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "this leads to a relative energy scale @xmath21 .",
    "these values are typically comparable to the interaction energy scale for pnipam in aqueous methanol .",
    "solvent particles always repel each other with a repulsive lj potential , with @xmath22 .",
    "this is a good approximation given that the @xmath13 and @xmath12 interactions are dominant , which will be discussed at a later stage .",
    "the cosolvent mole fraction @xmath23 is varied from 0 ( pure @xmath8 component ) to 1 ( pure @xmath9 component ) .",
    "we consider three different polymer chain lengths @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , solvated in @xmath27 solvent molecules for @xmath24 & @xmath28 and @xmath29 solvent molecules for @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "the equations of motion are integrated using a velocity verlet algorithm with a time step @xmath31 and a damping coefficient @xmath32 for the langevin thermostat .",
    "the initial configurations are equilibrated for typically several @xmath33 , depending on the chain length , which is at least an order of magnitude larger than the relaxation time in the system . after this",
    "initial equilibration averages are taken over another @xmath34 to obtain observables , especially gyration radii @xmath35 , chemical potentials @xmath36 of the polymer and the bridging fractions of cosolvents @xmath37 .",
    "in our previous paper @xcite , we provided a possible explanation for the experimentally observed co - non - solvency effect of smart polymers in aqueous mixtures @xcite .",
    "as a function of cosolvent molar concentration @xmath23 for three different chain lengths @xmath38 .",
    "results are shown for the default system taken from ref .  [ 1 ] .",
    "the error bars are the standard deviations calculated from six independent simulations .",
    "the lines are drawn to guide the eye .",

    "[ fig : rg_n ] we show the normalized radius of gyration @xmath39 as a function of cosolvent molar fraction @xmath23 .",
    "the data is shown for three different @xmath38 .",
    "it can be appreciated that just by adding a small fraction of the better of the two solvents , the polymer collapses into a compact globule structure .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , this reentrant collapse and swelling transition is facilitated by the preferential binding of cosolvent components with the polymer .",
    "the initial collapse is due to the formation of bridges that the cosolvent molecules form by binding two monomers that can be distinctly far along the backbone of a polymer , while the reopening at higher concentrations is due to the increased decoration of the polymer by cosolvent molecules .",
    "therefore , we can identify two kinds of cosolvents : fraction @xmath37 of bridging cosolvents that bind to two monomers and a fraction @xmath40 of cosolvents that are only bound to one monomer .",
    "note that other than @xmath37 and @xmath40 , there are a large fraction of free cosolvents that are present in the bulk solution and usually are required to maintain solvent equilibrium .",
    "it is also interesting to observe an inverse system size effect in the reopening transition , as observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : rg_n ] . while the initial collapse ( @xmath41 ) is reminiscent of a first - order - like collapse , the reopening ( for @xmath42 ) is rather smooth even for longer chain lengths .",

    "we have also plotted the analytical scattering function of a sphere .",
    "[ fig : sofk],scaledwidth=40.0% ]    as expected , a power law well approximated by @xmath49 is observed for @xmath50 ( pure solvent ) , a signature characteristics of an extended coil structure . for @xmath51 ,",
    "the polymer collapses into a compact globule , with @xmath52 decrease in @xmath35 with respect to its original extended @xmath35 at @xmath50 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rg_n ] ) , as shown by a prominent scaling law @xmath48 in fig .",
    "[ fig : sofk ] @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath35 for @xmath53 is slightly larger than the equivalent @xmath35 when a polymer collapses because of pure depletion effects .",
    "this is due to the fact that a collapsed polymer also contains interstitial bridging cosolvent and their sizes contribute towards a slightly larger compact globule .",
    "preferentiability is required for the observation of the co - non - solvency effect .",
    "therefore , conformations of polymers in mixed solvents are intimately linked to the asymmetry in @xmath13 and @xmath12 interactions @xmath54 .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_d ] we present a unified picture of polymer conformation with changing @xmath54 at different @xmath23 .",
    "it can be appreciated that , for @xmath55 , co - non - solvency is not observed and the polymer remains in a coil conformation . only when @xmath56 , does the polymer exhibit a coil - globule - coil - like scenario .",
    "more interestingly , the larger the difference @xmath54 the smoother the re - opening transition at larger @xmath23 values .",
    "this is not surprising given that for a stronger @xmath15 , @xmath37 has stronger binding , thus leading to a more stable semi - collapsed conformation .",
    "thermodynamically , the energy density in the solvation shell can be increased by increasing the @xmath13 interaction strength .",
    "increasing energy density by a factor of two will approximately act in a similar manner as that of a polymer of twice @xmath38 .",
    "interestingly enough , increased @xmath15 and/or @xmath38 has the same effect on the overall polymer conformation",
    ".    we also want to point out that , for @xmath57 , polymer collapse will occur close to @xmath58 . a more prominent representation of the region",
    "@xmath59 will require fine grids and systematic scanning of the concentrations within the range @xmath60 . here",
    ", however , while the initial collapse is always first order like , the re - opening has much stronger dependence on @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , we abstain from presenting any more details for @xmath60 .",
    "the most interesting aspect of this reentrant transition is that even when the solvent quality becomes better and better by the addition of the better good solvent , the polymer collapses in good solvent .",
    "this makes the polymer conformation decoupled from the solvent quality and only dictated by the preferential coordination of cosolvent with polymer .",
    "this particle based phenomenon can not be explained within a mean - field type approach .    before describing an analytical theory , we briefly want to comment on the suitability of the generic simulation protocol to study the complexity of smart polymers .",
    "one important aspect of smart polymers , such as pnipam , pvcl , and papome , is their thermal responsiveness .",
    "these polymers remain in a coil configuration at low temperatures , while collapsing into a compact globule at high temperatures , thus presenting a lower critical solution temperature ( lcst ) . in this context , it is worth mentioning that the generic schemes do not present lcst and co - non - solvency can be studied at one fixed temperature over full range of @xmath23 .",
    "moreover , the co - non - solvency effect is not necessarily restricted to the  so called \" smart polymers exhibiting lcst .",
    "therefore , a broad range of polymers are expected to show a similar reentrant scenario , as long as they are dissolved in a mixture of competing good solvents .",
    "a list of the possible polymer systems that show co - non - solvency is presented in table  [ tab : cns ] .",
    "standard polymers , such as peo in aqueous dmf @xcite and polystyrene in a mixture of n , n - dimethylformamide ( dmf ) and cyclohexane @xcite , also show co - non - solvency @xcite .",
    "another example includes polymeric semiconductors .",
    "it has been observed that the solution viscosity of polymeric semiconductors can display a non - monotonic dependency on cosolvent concentration , indicating conformational change @xcite .",
    "therefore , we speculate that many more polymers , such as polycarbonate or polypropylene , may also exhibit a similar reentrant transition in appropriate competing good solvents .",
    "another aspect is that the nipam monomer has a hydrophilic part and two hydrophobic parts , as shown in the schematic fig .",
    "[ fig : cart ] .    , scaledwidth=37.0% ]    it is generally believed that methanol molecules bind to the hydrophilic part and thus push away water molecules towards the hydrophobic part , leading to polymer collapse . in a generic simulation , however , the monomer is represented by a sphere , thus eliminating any effects due to hydro(phob / phil)icity within the model .",
    "our simulations @xcite suggests that the only dominant interaction is the preferential coordination of methanol around the nipam monomer ( see fig . 3 of ref . [ ] ) .",
