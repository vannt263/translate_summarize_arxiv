    "the most famous example is the @xmath2-laplacian operator @xmath17 with @xmath4",
    ". equation ( [ eq : ] ) is an abbreviation for @xmath18 @xmath19-a.e .",
    "we assume that @xmath20 is a brownian motion with values in a hilbert space ( see section 2 for details ) .",
    "we suppose linear growth of @xmath5 - roughly speaking @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( for a precise formulation see ( [ eq : phi ] ) in section 2 ) .",
    "the motivation for this is an interaction between the solution and the random perturbation caused by the brownian motion . for large values of @xmath23",
    "we expect a larger perturbation than for small values .",
    "+ since the @xmath2-laplace equation is a basic problem in non - linear pde s it can be understood as a model - problem to a large class of equations . in view of applications",
    "we especially mention the flow of non - newtonian fluids ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) which might be the topic of some future projects .",
    "the deterministic equivalent to the equation mentioned above is already well understood , we refer to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for the stationary case and to @xcite @xcite,@xcite for the evolutionary situation .",
    "we also refer to the survey papers @xcite and @xcite giving a nice overview .",
    "+ regarding the stochastic problem there is a lot of literature regarding the existence of solutions to nonlinear evolutionary equations .",
    "the popular variational approach by pardoux @xcite for spdes provides an existence theory for a quite general class of equations .",
    "it requires a banach space @xmath24 which is continuously embedded into the hilbert space @xmath25 on which the equation is considered .",
    "the main part of the equation is to be understood in the dual @xmath26 . in the situation ( [ eq:])-([eq : s ] ) we have @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "although this does not include the case @xmath29 ( this bound arises from sobolev s theorem ) system ( [ eq : ] ) can still be treated by slightly modified arguments . for recent developments we refer to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "+ however , there is not much literature about the regularity for nonlinear stochastic problems like ( [ eq : ] ) .",
    "certain regularity results about nonlinear stochastic pdes are known :    * in @xcite and @xcite semilinear stochastic pdes are considered , were also regularity statements are shown . anyway , the elliptic part of the equations studied there is still linear . * zhang @xcite observes non - linear stochastic pdes but only in space - dimension one . * very recently the regularity of certain nonlinear parabolic systems with stochastic perturbation was investigated in @xcite .",
    "the results are @xmath30-estimates for the solution under a quadratic growth assumption .",
    "the literature dedicated to the regularity theory for linear spdes is quite extensive , we refer to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the situation in the non - linear case is different , as explained above and to our best knowledge there is nothing about regularity for the stochastic @xmath2-laplacian system .",
    "hence this is the aim of the present paper .",

    "the estimate in ( [ neu ] ) is the natural extension of the results for non - linear pde s in the deterministic situation to the stochastic setting , see @xcite ( chapter 5 ) . in the deterministic case , it is also quite standard to get regularity results in time : testing with @xmath37 gives @xmath38 and @xmath39 . due to the appearance of the brownian motion such",
    "a results can not be true for the stochastic problem .",
    "we consider only the non - degenerated case , see ( [ eq : sp ] ) .",
    "however , the regularity estimates are independent of @xmath40 which means it is possible to obtain results for the degenerate case via approximation .",
    "it is only a technical matter to assume general dirichlet boundary conditions . in order to keep the proofs easier ,",
    "we assume them to be zero .",
    "a lot of other statements which are known in the deterministic situation are still open for the stochastic problem .",
    "for instance partial regularity for the parabolic problems with @xmath2-structure which is shown in @xcite via the @xmath41-caloric approximation method .",
    "the proof of ( [ eq : moser ] ) is based on moser iteration ( see for instance @xcite , ch . 8.5 , for a nice presentation in the stationary deterministic case ) .",
    "moser iteration in the stochastic setting also appears in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the authors study estimates and maximum princples for the solution to spdes with a linear operator in the main part .",
    "this paper is concerned with gradient estimates for nonlinear systems of spdes .",
    "our procedure is as follows : in section 3 we study the case @xmath42 .",
    "we apply the difference quotient method to gain higher differentiability and the corresponding estimates in the superquadratic case ( section 4 ) . since this does not work immediately if @xmath43 we approximate by a quadratic problem and show uniform estimates .",
    "we have to combine the techniques from non - linear pde s with stochastic calculus for martingales .",
    "note that it is not possible to work directly with test functions .",
