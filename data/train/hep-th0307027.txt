    "the intimate connection between string and gauge theories has been one of the dominant themes in theoretical high energy physics over the last years .",
    "a famous example is the equivalence ( duality ) of string theory on anti - de sitter ( ads ) spaces with conformal field theories , the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite , see e.g.  @xcite for a review .",
    "several arguments support the expectation of a duality between string and gauge theories or , even more generally , gravitational and non - gravitational theories .",
    "for example , a qualitative one comes from the fact that qcd , the @xmath3 gauge theory of strong interactions , confines chromoelectric flux to flux tubes  the qcd string  at low energies .",
    "after all , string theory was originally discovered in attempts to describe the spectrum of hadronic resonances .",
    "a quantitative argument is t hooft s analysis of the large @xmath4 limit of @xmath5 gauge theories  @xcite : for large @xmath4 and fixed t hooft coupling @xmath6 , the feynman diagram expansion can be rearranged according to the genus @xmath7 of the riemann surface which the diagram can be drawn on and every amplitude can be written in an expansion of the form @xmath8 , i.e.  @xmath9 is the effective genus counting parameter .",
    "this is like the perturbation series of a string theory , where the string coupling @xmath10 is identified with @xmath11 and @xmath12 corresponds to the loop - counting parameter of the string non - linear @xmath13-model .",
    "this a very general argument for the large @xmath4 duality between gauge theories and certain string theories , but it does not give an answer to what kind of string theory one should look for .",
    "further hints come from the study of black holes .",
    "the simplest example is the schwarzschild solution of general relativity depending on a single parameter , the mass @xmath14 of the black hole .",
    "they have a horizon and are black classically , everything crossing the horizon is inevitably pulled into the black hole singularity .",
    "however , semi - classical analysis shows that due to quantum processes black holes start to emit hawking radiation : the emission spectrum is roughly that of a blackbody with temperature @xmath15 ; the deviation of the pure blackbody spectrum is encoded in the so called ` greybody factor ' . as radiating systems black holes are expected to obey the laws of thermodynamics .",
    "if one defines the black hole entropy , as first proposed by bekenstein and hawking by @xmath16 , @xmath17 the area of the black hole horizon , these laws are in fact satisfied .",
    "a quantum theory of gravity should e.g.  provide the framework for a microscopic derivation of the black hole entropy via a counting of states and predict its greybody factor . as the bekenstein - hawking entropy involves the area instead of the volume , as is the case for statistical mechanics and local quantum field theories",
    ", one may wonder if one can find a holographic description in terms of local quantum field theories ` living ' on the horizon , such that @xmath18 .",
    "more generally , the holographic principle  @xcite asserts that the number of degrees of freedom of quantum gravity on some manifold scales as the area of its boundary : this suggests that a field theory on the boundary of space - time might capture the physics of gravity in the bulk . for reviews of the holographic principle",
    "see  @xcite ; for an introduction on black holes in string theory see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence explicitly realizes the general principles of large @xmath4 duality and holography . the simplest and best understood example is the equivalence of string theory on @xmath19 and the maximally supersymmetric gauge theory in four dimensions , @xmath20 @xmath5 super yang - mills ( sym ) .",
    "the latter arises as the low - energy ( i.e.  energies much smaller than the string scale @xmath21 ) effective theory on the world - volume of @xmath4 d3-branes .",
    "as these are charged under the four - form potential  @xcite , their presence generates a five - form flux in the ( flat ) transverse six - dimensional space .",
    "this flux contributes to the energy - momentum tensor , so the geometry backreacts and curves .",
    "the backreaction is negligible if the effective gravitational coupling is small , which is the case if @xmath22 . in this regime",
    "the gauge theory is weakly coupled . in the regime of strong coupling , the large @xmath4 limit ,",
    "the backreaction is no longer small and the geometry will change significantly . to be more precise , for @xmath23 we can use the dual description of d3-branes in terms of extremal three - branes in type iib supergravity  @xcite : in this picture , considering low - energy excitations on the d3-brane , translates to going to the near - horizon region of the three - brane since energies are red - shifted for an asymptotic observer  @xcite .",
    "the near - horizon region has the geometry of @xmath19 with radii @xmath24 and the five - form flux on the @xmath25 equals @xmath4 , the number of colors in the gauge theory .",
    "strongly coupled @xmath20 sym is identified with supergravity ( since the curvature @xmath26 ) on @xmath19 .",
    "it is believed that this duality is true for all values of parameters and extends to the full string theory ; this however is difficult to verify with the present technology , though there are some exceptions , see  @xcite . for reviews of attempts to use ads /",
    "cft as a starting point to obtain a string description of qcd or at least of pure @xmath27 sym , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "it was realized by berenstein , maldacena and nastase ( bmn )  @xcite that plane ( or pp ) wave backgrounds provide an interesting example where the string / gauge correspondence can be studied beyond the supergravity approximation . as will be explained in detail in what follows , on the geometric side this involves the penrose limit  @xcite applied for example to @xmath19 ; roughly speaking , one focuses on the neighborhood of the geodesic of a massless particle , in the center of @xmath28 and rotating on the @xmath25 .",
    "string theory in the resulting plane wave background can be exactly quantized in light - cone gauge  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in the gauge theory this limit singles out composite operators carrying a large charge  @xcite . though i will not discuss this here ,",
    "let me mention that one can also consider macroscopic rotating strings vs. large spin operators  @xcite .",
    "this work is organized as follows : section  [ chapter2 ] starts with a fairly general introduction to pp - wave backgrounds in ten / eleven - dimensional supergravities .",
    "i discuss various basic aspects of these backgrounds , in particular their ( super)symmetries , emphasizing the emergence of special maximally supersymmetric solutions that will play a major role in the rest of this work .",
    "then i introduce the notion and properties of the penrose limit of a space - time and show that this connects maximally supersymmetric pp - waves to the @xmath29 spaces .",
    "having introduced the necessary background material , the correspondence between iib string theory on the maximally supersymmetric plane wave and a double scaling limit of @xmath20 @xmath5 super yang - mills will be derived from the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "several features of this novel bmn correspondence , for example symmetries , the comparison of states and spectra , and holography , will be discussed in detail both from the ( free ) string theory and the gauge theory point of view .",
    "section  [ chapter3 ] presents extensions of the bmn duality .",
    "first an overview over various possible approaches is given to provide a feeling for the general picture that emerges .",
    "the ingredients are then used to describe in detail the specific example of the duality between strings on supersymmetric orbifolds of the plane wave background and @xmath30 quiver gauge theories .",
    "in addition to these generalizations , further issues to be discussed include d - branes on the plane wave and more complicated pp - wave backgrounds leading to interacting world - sheet theories .",
    "we return to string theory on the plane wave background in section  [ chapter4 ] , where string interactions are introduced .",
    "these correspond to non - planar corrections in the ( interacting ) dual gauge theory .",
    "i explain why it is natural to describe string interactions in the setup of light - cone string field theory and discuss its principles , in particular additional complications arising in the superstring as compared to its bosonic version . to make",
    "the presentation self - contained a review of the free string is included . in the following , the full construction of the cubic interaction vertex as well as the dynamical supercharges is presented ; the focus is mostly on the general methods and technical details are relegated to two appendices .",
    "the results thus obtained are applied to compute the mass shift of certain string states induced by interactions . in an approximation to be specified , the leading non - planar corrections to the anomalous dimension of the dual gauge theory operators are exactly recovered within string theory .",
    "finally , i conclude in section  [ chapter5 ] and discuss some open problems .",
    "it is known that maximally supersymmetric backgrounds of 11-dimensional supergravity include flat minkowski space , @xmath31 and @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "in addition to these three spaces there is another maximally supersymmetric solution discovered by kowalski - glikman  @xcite .",
    "this solution  which will be referred to as the kg space  arises as a special case of the more general pp - wave solutions  @xcite of the form @xmath33 where @xmath34 labels the transverse nine - dimensional space , @xmath35 is the four - form field strength of 11d supergravity and @xmath36 obeys @xmath37 @xmath38 is the laplacian in the transverse space @xmath39 and @xmath40 is closed and co - closed in @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath41 is a covariantly constant null vector . for constant @xmath40",
    "this solution preserves at least 16 supercharges  @xcite .",
    "an important subclass of solutions are the homogeneous plane wave space - times , where the field strength is constant and @xmath36 is independent of @xmath42 and quadratic in the @xmath43 @xmath44 with @xmath17 a constant , symmetric matrix . in this case",
    "the metric describes a lorentzian symmetric space @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 a ( solvable ) lie group depending on @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "solutions of this kind are space - times with a null ( @xmath48 ) homogeneous flux and were referred to as hpp - waves in  @xcite . up to the overall scale and permutations",
    "these solutions are parameterized by the eigenvalues of @xmath17 .",
    "modulo diffeomorphisms , there is precisely one choice for @xmath17 for which the solution is maximally supersymmetric .",
    "this is the kg solution @xmath49 let me briefly sketch the derivation of some of the statements that i made above .",
    "it is possible to verify that the pp - wave geometry in equation   is a solution of the supergravity equations of motion provided the conditions on @xmath40 and @xmath36 are satisfied . to analyze the number of preserved supersymmetries one has to consider the killing spinor equation .",
    "a solution to the supergravity equations of motion is supersymmetric if it is left invariant under some non - trivial supersymmetry transformation .",
    "if the fermions have been put to zero in the solution non - trivial conditions following from the requirement of unbroken supersymmetry only arise in the transformation of the fermions themselves .",
    "the gravitino transformation law gives rise to the killing spinor equation @xmath50 where the supercovariant derivative is @xmath51 iterating the first order killing equation implies the second order supergravity equations of motion . in other supergravities containing additional bosonic and fermionic fields the number of unbroken supersymmetries may be further constrained by algebraic equations arising from the variations of other fermions , such as for example the dilatino in type iib supergravity .",
    "computing the supercovariant derivative in the background equation   and solving the killing equation leads to  @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 is only a function of @xmath42 and @xmath40 is assumed to be constant .",
    "this is a first order ordinary differential equation , which has a unique solution for each initial value .",
    "hence , for constant field strength , the background in equation   generically preserves 16 supersymmetries . if one chooses the three - form @xmath40 and the matrix @xmath17 to be of the form given in equation   spinors satisfying @xmath54 solve the killing equation as well  @xcite and hence the kg solution is maximally supersymmetric .",
    "the fact that the hpp - wave geometry is a lorentzian symmetric space can be seen as follows  @xcite : consider the 20-dimensional lie algebra @xmath55=e_i^*\\,,\\qquad [ e_+,e_i^*]=a_{ij}e_j\\,,\\qquad [ e_i^*,e_j]=a_{ij}e_-\\,,\\ ] ] which is isomorphic to @xmath56 , @xmath57 the heisenberg algebra generated by @xmath58 , @xmath59 being the central element , and @xmath60 an outer automorphism which rotates coordinates @xmath61 and momenta @xmath62 .",
    "the hpp - wave space - time can then be constructed as the coset @xmath45 , where @xmath47 is the lie group with the algebra in   and @xmath63 is generated by @xmath62  @xcite . to verify this one proceeds in the standard way by choosing a representative of the coset and solving the cartan - maurer equations .",
    "notice that the inclusion of the form flux respects these symmetries as @xmath35 is parallel . for a generic hpp - wave background these are all the isometries , in special cases however , the number of isometries is enlarged due to symmetries of @xmath17 and @xmath35 .",
    "for example , for the kg solution the isometry is enhanced to a semi - direct product @xmath64 due to the degeneracy of the eigenvalues of @xmath17 .",
    "notice that the dimension of the isometry algebra of the kg solution is 38 , which equals the dimension of the isometry algebras of the two other non - trivial maximally supersymmetric solutions @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively ) .",
    "one suspects that this is not merely a coincidence .",
    "recall that flat space and @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) play the role of asymptotic and near - horizon limits of the m2-brane ( m5-brane ) and as such are related to each other . is there a connection to the kg solution as well ?",
    "i will say more about this in the next section .",
    "the full superalgebra can be obtained by utilizing the fact that for @xmath67 , @xmath68 killing spinors , @xmath69 is a killing vector and by analyzing the transformations of killing spinors induced by the action of the killing vectors .",
    "this has been done in  @xcite to which i refer for details .",
    "the story is similar for type iib supergravity  @xcite .",
    "the analogue of equation   is @xmath70 with the dilaton being constant and all other supergravity fields set to zero .",
    "the equations of motion for @xmath71 require that the four - form @xmath40 is self - dual and closed in @xmath72 and hence also co - closed .",
    "again , @xmath36 has to satisfy the poisson equation in transverse space @xmath73 for @xmath40 constant , this solution preserves as least 16 supersymmetries  @xcite . in analogy with the 11d case",
    ", the subclass of solutions in which @xmath36 is of the form  , describe lorentzian symmetric space - times with homogeneous five - form flux .",
    "there is again one exceptional , maximally supersymmetric solution  @xcite @xmath74 here @xmath75 is a parameter with dimension of mass , which by a rescaling of @xmath42 and @xmath76 can be set to any non - zero value .",
    "it has become common in the literature to refer to this solution as the _ plane wave background_. the isometry algebra of the plane wave solution is @xmath77 notice that the metric by itself has an @xmath78 symmetry , which however , is broken by the field strength to @xmath79 .",
    "the isometry group also contains a discrete @xmath80 exchanging the two transverse @xmath81 s .",
    "the dimension of the isometry algebra is 30  again the same as of the @xmath82 of @xmath19 .",
    "let me be more explicit about the killing vectors of the plane wave solution generating the algebra @xmath83 .",
    "a convenient parametrization is  @xcite instead of @xmath84 since indices are raised and lowered with the plane wave metric and @xmath85 is non - zero .",
    "so @xmath86 by definition . ]",
    "@xmath87 they obey the algebra @xmath88",
    "= i\\m^2j^{+i}\\,,\\qquad [ p^i , j^{+j}]=i\\d_{ij}p^+\\,,\\qquad [ p^-,j^{+i}]=-ip^i\\,,\\ ] ] and transform in the obvious way under the transverse @xmath89 .",
    "the generators @xmath90 , @xmath91 are hermitian and related to @xmath92 by trivial rescaling .",
    "it is convenient to work with the former to make the flat space limit @xmath93 manifest .",
    "i will present some of the remaining ( anti)commutation relations of the plane wave superalgebra in section  [ chapter4 ] when i need them , see  @xcite for the full algebra .",
    "one might wonder if there are any further maximally supersymmetric solutions of ten / eleven - dimensional supergravities , however , as was proved in  @xcite by careful analysis of the constraints arising from the supersymmetry variations , this is not the case .",
    "it is instructive to discuss the issue of supersymmetry in hpp - wave backgrounds in more detail , in particular the dependence of the killing spinors on the coordinate @xmath42 . for @xmath40 constant and hence @xmath36 independent of @xmath42 , the killing spinors of the background",
    "are independent of @xmath76 and can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath94\\right)\\chi\\,,\\qquad w\\equiv\\frac{1}{4!}\\varphi_{ijkl}\\g^{ijkl}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath95 has only @xmath42 dependence determined by @xmath96 additionally one has the requirement that @xmath97 this equation determines the number of killing spinors . as @xmath98 is a solution for any @xmath36 satisfying equation",
    ", the generic hpp - wave background has 16 _ standard _ killing spinors  @xcite . by equation",
    "these are also independent of the @xmath43 .",
    "generically the standard spinors depend on the coordinate @xmath42 but they are independent of it if @xmath99 .",
    "this equation may or may not have solutions depending on the explicit form of the four - form @xmath40 .",
    "if @xmath36 is quadratic in @xmath43 the above equation may admit additional killing spinors @xmath95 that are annihilated by @xmath100 .",
    "these _ supernumerary _ spinors are always independent of @xmath42  @xcite but depend on the @xmath43 via equation  .",
    "performing a t - duality along @xmath42 , those killing spinors which are independent of @xmath42 will survive at the level of the low - energy effective field theory and the resulting type iia solution will also be supersymmetric .",
    "so in the generic case ( only standard killing spinors , all depending on @xmath42 ) , performing a t - duality along @xmath42 results in a non - supersymmetric solution of type iia supergravity . in special cases like the plane wave background ( 16 supernumerary spinors )",
    ", the iia solution will be supersymmetric .",
    "lifting this solution to 11 dimensions gives rise to a supersymmetric deformed m2-brane with additional four - form flux  @xcite .",
    "one can also revert this logic  @xcite and analyze the killing spinors of the 11d hpp - waves . in this case",
    "the supernumerary killing spinors generically also depend on @xmath42 .",
    "dimensionally reducing the hpp - wave on @xmath42 or @xmath43 ( provided the latter is a killing direction ) one gets a d0-brane or iia pp - wave , respectively and the number of preserved supersymmetries is again determined by the coordinate dependence of the killing spinors in 11 dimensions .",
    "we have seen in the previous subsection that ten / eleven - dimensional supergravities admit maximally supersymmetric solutions of the pp - wave type , the plane - wave background and the kg solution , respectively .",
    "these are on equal footing with the other more standard maximally supersymmetric backgrounds , that is flat space and the @xmath29 solutions .",
    "but whereas the latter are connected being the asymptotic and near - horizon regions respectively of fundamental branes , no such connection was known for the pp - waves .",
    "i have already mentioned that the dimensions of the superalgebras of the kg and plane wave solutions agree with those of @xmath29 , so one might expect that there exists a connection between the two .",
    "in fact it does  @xcite and the connection is the penrose - gven limit as defined originally by penrose  @xcite and extended to supergravity by gven  @xcite .",
    "i review this limit below .",
    "consider a lorentzian space - time and a null geodesic @xmath101 in it .",
    "according to  @xcite for a sufficiently well - behaved geodesic one can introduce local coordinates @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 such that the metric in the neighborhood of @xmath101 takes the form @xmath105 where @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 are functions of the coordinates .",
    "the coordinate @xmath102 is the affine parameter of @xmath101 and for @xmath101 to be well - behaved @xmath109 must be invertible , otherwise the coordinate system breaks down .",
    "supergravities contain additional fields besides the metric , such as the dilaton @xmath110 and @xmath111-form potentials @xmath112 .",
    "in particular the @xmath111-forms have a gauge symmetry and this gauge freedom can be used to eliminate some of the components of @xmath112 .",
    "indeed , one can choose locally  @xcite @xmath113 this is the starting point of the penrose - gven limit : a null geodesic @xmath101 which locally is described by the metric in equation   plus ( possibly ) additional background fields which are gauge fixed to have the local form in equation  .",
    "the next step consists in introducing a real , positive constant @xmath114 and rescaling the coordinates as @xmath115 this diffeomorphism results in a @xmath114-dependent family of fields @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 and the coordinate choices in equations   and   ensure that the following penrose limit  @xcite , extended by gven  @xcite to fields other than the metric , is well - defined : @xmath119 due to the rescaling of coordinates in   the limiting fields only depend on @xmath120 and the background takes the form @xmath121 here @xmath122 is the @xmath123-form field strength of @xmath124 and @xmath125 denotes @xmath126 .",
    "this background describes a pp - wave with null flux in _ rosen _ coordinates  @xcite .",
    "it is possible to change to _ brinkmann _ coordinates , where the resulting metric takes the form @xmath127 considered in the previous subsection . for more details ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "before i explicitly show that this mechanism connects the kg and plane wave solutions with the @xmath128 ones , it is instructive to discuss some important _ hereditary _ properties of the penrose limit  @xcite .",
    "as we have seen , the penrose limit basically consists of two steps , performing a diffeomorphism and gauge - fixing with a subsequent rescaling of the supergravity fields .",
    "it is a general property of supergravity actions that they transform homogeneously under the rescaling of fields in equation  .",
    "hence , if the original background is a solution to the supergravity equations of motion , so is the new @xmath114-dependent one for any @xmath129 and by continuity the limiting configuration   is a valid supergravity background  @xcite .",
    "the penrose limit inherits further properties of its parent solution , involving for example the curvature tensor ; the penrose limit of a conformally flat space - time is conformally flat , that of an einstein space is ricci - flat and another hereditary property is that of being locally symmetric , see for example  @xcite .",
    "one may also wonder about the fate of isometries and supersymmetries ; these are hereditary in the sense that the resulting background has _ at least _ as many isometries and supersymmetries as the parent background  @xcite .",
    "let me show that this is the case .",
    "consider a killing vector @xmath130 of the metric @xmath7 . performing",
    "the rescaling of coordinates and fields in equations   and  , @xmath131 and @xmath132 is a killing vector for the transformed metric @xmath133 for non - zero @xmath114 .",
    "the question is if a weight @xmath134 exists such that the limit @xmath135 is both non - singular and non - zero . in",
    "the local coordinates adapted to the null geodesic @xmath130 can be written as @xmath136 performing the rescaling of coordinates one can expand @xmath132 around @xmath137 as @xmath138 then for @xmath139 being the coefficient of the first non - vanishing term in this expansion @xmath140 is finite and non - zero .",
    "now suppose we have two linearly independent killing vectors @xmath141 and @xmath142",
    ". then it might happen that their leading order terms in a small-@xmath114 expansion are linearly dependent , for definiteness assume they are equal .",
    "do we loose a killing vector here ?",
    "consider the difference @xmath143 by construction the leading order term is zero .",
    "the next to leading term defines a new killing vector @xmath144 .",
    "if @xmath144 and @xmath145 are linearly independent we are done , if not one has to iterate the procedure .",
    "one can show  @xcite that eventually one ends up with two linearly independent killing vectors of the limiting space - time .",
    "hence the number of killing vectors never decreases in the penrose - gven limit .",
    "notice however that it may very well happen that it _",
    "increases_. this is because we have seen that the resulting space - time is of the hpp - wave form and as we know from the previous section this space - time has always an isometry algebra isomorphic to a @xmath146-dimensional heisenberg algebra plus outer automorphism ( in d dimensions ) .",
    "so some isometries need not have a counterpart in the original space - time and can arise only in the limit @xmath147 .",
    "it is also important to realize that because different killing vectors @xmath130 may have to be rescaled with different weights @xmath134 the original isometry algebra may get contracted in the limit .",
    "the discussion of the hereditary properties of killing spinors is similar .",
    "again , no supersymmetries are lost in the limit , though the number of killing spinors may increase ( as we have seen hpp - waves preserve at least 16 supersymmetries ) . for a more detailed and rigorous discussion",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "the information acquired above is already quite powerful .",
    "consider for example the penrose limit of @xmath128 .",
    "anti de - sitter is a conformally flat , locally symmetric , einstein space .",
    "the limiting space - time is ricci - flat , conformally flat and locally symmetric and hence isometric to flat minkowski space .",
    "we are primarily interested in the maximally supersymmetric @xmath29 backgrounds .",
    "now the result depends on the geodesic : if it lies purely in @xmath128 we get minkowski space ( the sphere is blown up to flat space in the limit as well ) ; if not it follows from the hereditary properties that we have to get the kg solution and the plane wave background as limiting space - times  @xcite .",
    "i will also show this explicitly below for the case of @xmath19 . for @xmath31 and @xmath32 the penrose - gven limits are isomorphic to each other and result in the kg solution  @xcite .",
    "the spaces @xmath148 with radii of curvature related by @xmath149 provide an example which illustrates the above behavior of isometries  @xcite .",
    "the original isometry algebra is @xmath150 .",
    "the @xmath151 factor is contracted to @xmath152 .",
    "the @xmath153 creation- and @xmath153 annihilation operators transform as vectors under @xmath154 . similarly @xmath155 contracts to @xmath156 .",
    "the central elements of the two heisenberg algebras coincide ; this is due to the fact that two killing vectors of the parent space - time agree to leading order in small @xmath114 .",
    "thus the two heisenberg algebras combine into @xmath157 .",
    "the remaining killing vector @xmath144 becomes an outer automorphism and the resulting contracted algebra is  @xcite @xmath158 if the radii of curvature are equal ( as is the case for @xmath159 ) the subalgebra @xmath160 is enlarged to the full @xmath161 .",
    "this has no counterpart in the original background .    finally , consider the penrose - gven limit of @xmath19 explicitly .",
    "the dilaton is constant and in global coordinates the metric and five - form flux is @xmath162\\,,\\\\ f_5 & = 4r^4\\bigl[\\cosh\\r\\sinh^3\\r dt\\wedge d\\r\\wedge d\\o_3 + \\cos\\theta\\sin^3\\theta d\\psi\\wedge d\\theta \\wedge d\\o'_3\\bigr ] , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath163 and @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 $ ] and @xmath167 $ ] . as alluded to above , in order that the limiting space - time will be non - trivial the null geodesic must not lie purely within @xmath28 ; so consider a massless particle sitting at the origin of @xmath28 ( @xmath168 ) and rotating around the circle of the @xmath25 parameterized by @xmath169 and @xmath170  @xcite . to focus on the geometry in the neighborhood of this",
    "geodesic the coordinates are rescaled such that a tube around the geodesic is blown up .",

    "blowing up the neighborhood of the geodesic is equivalent to taking @xmath173 and the metric and five - form flux become @xmath174 this is the plane wave solution of type iib supergravity  @xcite .      in the previous subsection",
    "i reviewed the connection of @xmath19 and the plane wave background via the penrose - gven limit .",
    "as iib string theory on @xmath19 is dual to @xmath20 @xmath5 super yang - mills by the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite the implications of the penrose - gven limit on the dual cft can be studied .",
    "it has been known for some time that strings on pp - wave ns - ns backgrounds are exactly solvable , see e.g.  @xcite . in light - cone gauge this is also true for a large class of pp - wave backgrounds , in particular the maximally supersymmetric plane wave , in spite of the presence of the constant flux  @xcite .",
    "so one may hope that this simpler setup allows to extend our understanding of the ads / cft duality beyond the supergravity approximation by the inclusion of string states on the plane wave .",
    "this is indeed the case as was demonstrated by berenstein , maldacena and nastase in  @xcite .",
    "the formulation of the bmn correspondence is the subject of this subsection .    following the construction of the type iib superstring action on @xmath19 using superspace coset methods  @xcite , the action on the plane wave background was constructed by metsaev in  @xcite .",
    "let me briefly sketch this construction .",
    "the action has to obey the following conditions : its bosonic part is the @xmath13-model with the plane wave geometry being the target space ; it is globally supersymmetric with respect to the plane wave superalgebra and locally @xmath175-symmetric ; it reduces to the standard green - schwarz action in the flat space limit .",
    "as shown in  @xcite this conditions uniquely specify the action , which as in flat space can be written as a sum of a ` kinetic ' @xmath13-model term and a wess - zumino term .",
    "the latter is needed to obey the condition of @xmath175-symmetry . to find the explicit form of the superstring action in terms of the coordinate ( super)fields a parametrization of the coset representative has to be specified and the cartan - maurer equations have to solved .",
    "not surprisingly , the resulting covariant action is non - polynomial  @xcite .",
    "the simplest way to proceed is to study the action in light - cone gauge . as in flat space",
    "the light - cone gauge - fixing procedure consists of two steps , first @xmath175-symmetry is fixed by the fermionic light - cone gauge choice @xmath176 , then the diffeomorphism and weyl - symmetry on the world - sheet is fixed by the bosonic light - cone gauge @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "the resulting action is quadratic in both bosonic and fermionic superstring @xmath179 fields , and hence can be quantized explicitly  @xcite .",
    "in fact , from the form of the metric in equation  , it is obvious that the action for the eight transverse directions in light - cone gauge is just that for eight bosons of mass @xmath75 .",
    "similarly the fermions acquire masses due to the coupling to the background  @xcite .",
    "masses of bosons and fermions are equal due to world - sheet supersymmetry : after imposing the light - cone gauge conditions the world - sheet @xmath175-symmetry and space - time supersymmetries transmute into rigid world - sheet supersymmetries . as in flat space 16 of the 32 supersymmetries",
    "are linearly realized in light - cone gauge and commute with the hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that the linearly realized supersymmetries correspond to the supernumerary killing spinors of the pp - wave backgrounds .",
    "this is in agreement with their independence of @xmath42  @xcite ( cf .",
    "section  [ sec21 ] ) .",
    "after gauge - fixing the light - cone action becomes  @xcite @xmath180\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath181 and @xmath182 is a majorana spinor on the world - sheet and a positive chirality @xmath183 spinor under rotations in the eight transverse directions .",
    "it is not difficult to quantize this action and the resulting light - cone hamiltonian is  @xcite @xmath184 here @xmath185 is a label for the fourier mode and @xmath186 is the occupation number of that mode including bosons and fermions . the ground state energy is cancelled between bosons and fermions .",
    "in contrast to flat space , modes with @xmath187 are also harmonic oscillators due to the mass terms on the world - sheet and string theory on the plane wave has a unique ground state @xmath188 , @xmath189 the light - cone momentum .",
    "the single string hilbert space is built by acting with the bosonic and fermionic creation oscillators ( for all @xmath185 ) on @xmath188 subject to the level - matching condition for physical states @xmath190 truncation to the zero - mode sector gives rise to the spectrum of iib supergravity on the plane wave  @xcite .",
    "i will provide more details on the quantization of strings on the plane wave in section  [ free ] , where i need them .    to understand the effect of the penrose - gven limit on the dual cft , consider the scaling behavior of the energy @xmath191 and angular momentum @xmath192 of a state in @xmath19 .",
    "recall that the ads / cft correspondence relates the energy of a string state in @xmath19 to the energy of a state in @xmath20 sym living on @xmath193  @xcite , which is the ( conformal ) boundary of @xmath19 in global coordinates . by the operator - state map ,",
    "the energy of a state on @xmath193 , where the @xmath194 has unit radius , translates to the conformal dimension @xmath38 of an operator on @xmath195 .",
    "likewise , the angular momentum @xmath196 on the @xmath25 translates to the r - charge under a @xmath197 subgroup of the full @xmath198 r - symmetry of @xmath20 sym .",
    "then we have the following relations @xmath199 now what happens if we apply the limit @xmath173 ?",
    "firstly , @xmath173 means @xmath200 , the string coupling @xmath10 and hence also @xmath201 should be kept fixed . then a configuration with fixed , non - zero @xmath189 requires to scale @xmath38 , @xmath202 .",
    "in fact , the plane wave superalgebra implies that @xmath36 and @xmath189 are non - negative or equivalently @xmath203 ; this also follows from the representation theory of the 4d superconformal algebra .",
    "so the penrose - gven limit induces the following double - scaling or bmn limit in @xmath20 @xmath5 sym  @xcite @xmath204 as a first check consider how the bosonic part of the plane wave superalgebra @xmath205 is realized in the gauge theory on @xmath193 .",
    "the conformal group @xmath206 is generated by the seven killing vectors of @xmath207 and eight additional conformal killing vectors . by singling out a @xmath197 subgroup with generator @xmath196 the @xmath208 symmetry is broken to @xmath209 .",
    "so we see that the transverse symmetry corresponds to @xmath210 and the isometry group of the @xmath194  @xcite . in the bmn limit",
    ", the eight conformal killing vectors together with the eight broken generators of r - symmetry give rise to a heisenberg algebra @xmath211 with central element @xmath196 and outer automorphism @xmath212 , see for example  @xcite .",
    "in other words the @xmath20 superalgebra contracts to the plane wave superalgebra in the penrose - gven limit . in the previous subsection",
    "i have argued that this is the case , see also  @xcite for an explicit demonstration .",
    "it is an important question how the unitary irreducible representations  e.g.  composite operators in @xmath20 sym  behave under the contraction  @xcite . in the limit they should form representations of the plane wave superalgebra .",
    "in particular , as the conformal dimension diverges in the bmn limit , the space - time dependence of their correlation functions is ill - defined and hence requires special treatment .",
    "one way to achieve this was proposed in  @xcite and requires to combine space - time with an auxiliary r - symmetry space much in the same way that @xmath38 and @xmath196 combine into the finite quantity @xmath213 .",
    "the manifestation of the discrete @xmath214 exchanging the two transverse @xmath195 s in the gauge theory is somewhat mysterious .",
    "the bmn limit is different from the t hooft limit of @xmath5 gauge theories and at first sight puzzling . to see why this is so ,",
    "recall that the t hooft limit takes @xmath200 , @xmath215 , such that the t hooft coupling @xmath216 is fixed .",
    "away from the strict @xmath200 limit all feynman diagrams of a given order in @xmath11 can be drawn on a riemann surface whose euler number is precisely the power of @xmath4 to which these diagrams contribute  @xcite .",
    "so @xmath9 is identified with the genus counting parameter and the perturbation series of the gauge theory may then be organized in a double series expansion in the effective coupling @xmath12 and the genus counting parameter @xmath9 .",
    "this is the standard lore why large @xmath4 gauge theories are expected to be dual to some weakly coupled string theory with coupling @xmath11 .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence provides a concrete example where this is realized .",
    "the above reasoning breaks down because operators in the field theory are not held fixed in the limit but acquire an infinite charge as @xmath200 . indeed , using equation   and @xmath217 , in the bmn limit @xmath218 these relations are quite suggestive .",
    "it looks like a new effective coupling @xmath219 and a new effective genus counting parameter @xmath220 might develop as a consequence of the simultaneous infinite scaling of @xmath4 and @xmath196 .",
    "this is in some sense correct as i will explain in more detail below .",
    "while most of the ( unprotected ) operators acquire infinite anomalous dimension and decouple in the bmn limit , it is conceivable that some ( bmn ) operators with a suitable scaling of charge survive and be dual to string states in the plane wave background ( for a general discussion , see  @xcite ) . at the planar level",
    "this class of operators has been identified in  @xcite . recall that @xmath20 sym contains six scalar fields @xmath221 of conformal dimension one transforming in the @xmath222 of @xmath208 .",
    "take @xmath196 to be the @xmath197 generator rotating the 5 - 6-plane and define @xmath223 .",
    "@xmath224 carries unit @xmath196-charge and the remaining four scalars @xmath225 , @xmath226 are invariant under @xmath197 . for simplicity , consider only single - trace operators for the moment",
    ". the operator corresponding to the string ground state should carry large @xmath196 charge and have @xmath227 .",
    "there is a unique single - trace operator satisfying this requirement which subsequently is identified with @xmath188  @xcite @xmath228 \\lr |v , p^+\\ra\\,,\\ ] ] where the trace is over color indices . at weak coupling",
    "the dimension of this operator is @xmath196 since each @xmath224 field has dimension one .",
    "as the operator is a chiral primary  @xcite it is protected by supersymmetry and @xmath227 for all values of the coupling .",
    "the normalization is chosen such that the operator has normalized two - point function when we restrict ourselves to planar diagrams .",
    "however , non - planar diagrams do give a non - vanishing contribution in the bmn limit and the two - point function of @xmath229 $ ] can be computed exactly for all genera  @xcite .",
    "this can be understood by noting that at genus @xmath230 diagrams are weighted by @xmath231 as expected , but at the same time the number of diagrams grows as @xmath232 , see also  @xcite .",
    "so we see the quantity @xmath220 emerging as the effective genus counting parameter for the above operator",
    ". this will also be true for more general bmn operators , to be described below .",
    "there is an additional complication : at finite @xmath233 single - trace operators are no longer orthogonal to multi - trace operators and it is therefore no longer justified to restrict attention to single - trace operators only . to simplify matters",
    "let me assume @xmath234 in what follows ; then equation   is a precise identification .",
    "i will return to the issue of operator mixing below .",
    "next consider the supergravity states obtained by acting with the eight bosonic and fermionic zero - mode oscillators @xmath235 and @xmath236 on the plane wave vacuum .",
    "each oscillator raises the energy by @xmath75 . in the gauge theory",
    "these are obtained by the action of the broken symmetries on the trace of @xmath224 s  @xcite .",
    "for example we can rotate @xmath224 into @xmath225 by a broken @xmath208 transformation . applying this to @xmath237",

    "this is already known from the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite .",
    "one of the crucial insights of  @xcite was to extend this identification to ` massive ' string states .",
    "these are constructed similarly to the above but now each insertion is accompanied with a phase . for example , the operator @xmath247\\ ] ] reduces to the supergravity state considered above for @xmath187 , but it vanishes for nonzero @xmath185 due to the cyclicity of the trace .",
    "this is precisely how it should be : a single non - zero - mode acting on the vacuum does not satisfy the level - matching condition  .",
    "so the next - simplest possibility is to consider  @xcite @xmath248 \\lr a_n^{i\\,\\dg}a_{-n}^{j\\,\\dg}|v , p^+\\ra\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath242 , the cyclicity of the trace was used to put one operator at the first position and @xmath249 contributions have been neglected in the power of the phase factor .",
    "the general rule is quite simple , each insertion of an ` impurity ' is accompanied with a phase depending on the world - sheet momentum ; those operators where the momenta do not sum to zero vanish due to cyclicity of the trace , in this way implementing the level matching condition ; the dictionary between impurity insertions and string oscillators is thus roughly ( cf .",
    "the discussion below ) as follows  @xcite @xmath250 to check this identification it is useful to expand the string theory hamiltonian   for large @xmath251 or equivalently for small @xmath219 ( cf .",
    "equation  ) @xmath252 we see that for @xmath253 all string states have approximately the same energy ; this is reproduced by the construction of the bmn operators : in free field theory the inclusion of the phases does not make a difference , it is only in the interacting theory that this gets important because these operators are no longer protected .",
    "notice however , that the bmn operators proposed to be dual to string states are built by sewing together protected operators with varying phases .",
    "one might imagine that these operators are nearly bps in the sense that a delicate cancellation of renormalization and large @xmath196 effects protects them from leaving the spectrum in the bmn limit .",
    "this is exactly what happens  @xcite .",
    "remarkably it turns out that the anomalous dimensions of these operators are not just finite in the bmn limit , but as has been argued in  @xcite , they are perturbatively computable with @xmath219 playing the role of the effective coupling . indeed ,",
    "notice that the first correction in   involves the t hooft coupling @xmath12 so it seems one might reproduce this from a _ perturbative _ ( in @xmath254 or @xmath12 ) field theory computation . consider for example the operator in  .",
    "taking into account interactions the relevant diagrams arise from the quartic vertex @xmath255[\\bar{z},\\phi^i]\\bigr)\\,.\\ ] ] the effect of this vertex can be analyzed as follows .",
    "the above interaction can be split into two parts , depending on whether the position of the operator @xmath256 in the ` string ' of @xmath224 s is effectively moved to a neighboring position or not . since at the planar level operators with @xmath256 s sitting at different positions",
    "are orthogonal to each other , contracting all the fields gives a result which , for the first class , does not depend on the insertion of the phases , whereas for the second class it does . combining the relevant contributions , utilizing the fact that other interactions involving gauge bosons and scalar loops cancel due to supersymmetry and taking the large @xmath4 and @xmath196 limit one",
    "precisely reproduces the first non - trivial correction in  @xcite . for a careful treatment",
    "see for example  @xcite .",
    "notice that the computation was done perturbatively in @xmath12 , but to take the bmn limit requires to send @xmath257 .",
    "but the result for small @xmath12 equals the one for large @xmath12 obtained from the string hamiltonian and it is tempting to assume that it is correct for all @xmath12 at the planar level .",
    "further support to this conjecture comes from  @xcite which extended the above computation to two loops and presented arguments for higher loops , again matching the expectation coming from the expansion of the square root in  . in  @xcite superconformal representation theory",
    "was used to argue that the full square root is reproduced ; alternatively this was seen to be the case in  @xcite by exponentiating the quartic vertex ; let me sketch how this works .",
    "sym on @xmath193 can be expanded in spherical harmonics on the @xmath194 .",
    "in particular the zero - modes of scalar fields on the @xmath194 have unit energy and the ` string ' of oscillators corresponding to the zero - mode of @xmath224 carries @xmath227 . to raise the energy we insert for example the zero - mode of @xmath258 at some position along the string of @xmath224 oscillators . in the free theory",
    "the position of @xmath256 is unchanged and operators with @xmath256 inserted at different positions are orthogonal in the planar approximation .",
    "so we can think of the @xmath196 @xmath224 s as defining a lattice with @xmath259 sites and an insertion of @xmath256 at different positions corresponds to the excitations @xmath260 at the @xmath261-th site of the lattice .",
    "as alluded to above , the interaction in   can move an operator @xmath256 to a neighboring position , so when acting on the string of @xmath224 oscillators the effective hamiltonian for @xmath256 consisting of the free and interacting parts is  @xcite @xmath262 ^ 2\\right)\\,.\\ ] ] in the large @xmath4 and @xmath196 continuum limit the discretized hamiltonian reduces to @xmath263\\,,\\qquad l=\\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\l}}\\frac{j}{\\m}=2\\pi\\a'p^+\\,.\\ ] ] this _ is _ the bosonic part of the string light - cone hamiltonian on the plane wave . consequently the full square root is reproduced from planar gauge theory in the bmn limit and the ` string ' of @xmath224 s plus insertion of impurities becomes equivalent to the physical string  @xcite .",
    "so there is evidence that @xmath219 emerges as a new effective coupling in the bmn limit and one might think that the perturbation series of sym in the bmn limit can be reorganized as a double series expansion in the effective coupling @xmath219 and the effective genus counting parameter @xmath220 . if true , the bmn duality has the interesting property that regimes in string theory on the plane wave and sym in the bmn limit are _ simultaneously _ perturbatively accessible .",
    "this is in contrast to the usual ads / cft correspondence , where due to our limited ability to perform calculations for finite @xmath12 in sym  or equivalently in the full string theory on @xmath19  the relation is a strong / weak coupling duality .",
    "note however , while perturbative calculations in @xmath12 of bmn operator two- and three - point functions can be reorganized in @xmath219  @xcite  and hence an extrapolation to large @xmath12 seems viable  this is no longer the case for higher point functions : computing for example the 4-point function of @xmath264 $ ] perturbatively in @xmath12 , a naive extrapolation to large @xmath12 leads to divergences  @xcite .",
    "the above heuristic discussion is in fact oversimplifying .",
    "consider for example the bmn operators with @xmath265 , that is a _ defect charge _ of two .",
    "instead of inserting two impurities ( defects ) into the trace of @xmath224 s we could also insert one @xmath241 , @xmath266 , @xmath267 etc .",
    ", that is fields carrying multiple defect charge .",
    "indeed , all of these are present , even at the planar level  @xcite . however , they do not give rise to additional string states ( there are none ) but are _ hidden _ within the ordinary operators with single charge defects by _ operator mixing _  @xcite .",
    "one example where this happens is the @xmath268 singlet  @xcite @xmath269 -4\\cos\\frac{\\pi n}{j+3}\\tr\\bigl[\\bar{z}z^{j+1}\\bigr]\\,.\\ ] ] written like this it is in fact an exact one - loop eigenstate of @xmath38 even for finite @xmath196  @xcite . roughly speaking the above mixing",
    "is needed to cancel singularities that occur when the two @xmath256 impurities collide  @xcite . for non - zero @xmath185",
    "the above operator is the primary of a long @xmath20 superconformal multiplet and all the other defect charge two operators dual to string states in the bmn limit are contained in this multiplet as descendants  @xcite .",
    "all fields with defect charge two _ do _ appear in these generalized bmn operators .",
    "analogously , for @xmath187 the operator in equation   is the primary of a half bps multiplet ; all operators dual to supergravity states with up to two oscillators are descendants .",
    "one might conjecture that this pattern generalizes to higher defect charge  @xcite",
    ".    at finite @xmath233 mixing of single - trace with multi - trace operators has to be taken into account  @xcite .",
    "for example , to compute the anomalous dimension on the torus single- and double - trace operators have to be redefined ( mixed ) in order to normalize and diagonalize their two - point functions .",
    "for the ( redefined ) operator in   one finds at order @xmath270  @xcite @xmath271\\,.\\ ] ] in fact , the above result holds for all bmn operators with defect charge two transforming in the various irreducible representations of @xmath272 ; this is a consequence of superconformal symmetry  @xcite . for the explicit form of some of the redefined operators at this order see  @xcite .",
    "it is actually simpler to consider directly the dilatation operator , work with the ` bare ' operators and diagonalize the resulting anomalous dimension matrix .",
    "this approach was followed in  @xcite and results in a simple derivation of equation  .",
    "further results on higher genus correlators include  @xcite , scalar / vector , vector / vector and multi - trace bmn operators have also been considered in  @xcite . for an extension of equation   to order @xmath273 see  @xcite .",
    "the contribution of higher genus corrections to the anomalous dimension is related to a mass - shift of the dual string states due to interactions .",
    "a detailed study of string interactions will be deferred to section  [ chapter4 ] .",
    "let me however mention a route  which will not be pursued in what follows  to study interacting strings on the plane wave , the string - bit formalism  @xcite .",
    "inspired by the emergence of the free string , discretized into @xmath196 bits along the string coordinate @xmath13 as in   and from matrix string theory  @xcite , one interprets the @xmath196 small strings as describing the quantization of the @xmath196-th symmetric product of the plane wave target space .",
    "this leads to a quantum - mechanical orbifold model . in a spirit reminding of the matrix string , string splitting and joining",
    "is then realized by an operator that roughly speaking exchanges two string bits ; see  @xcite for details .",
    "this approach was further studied in  @xcite and led to results in agreement with field theory .",
    "very recently , doubts on the consistency of this model have been voiced in  @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is the so - called fermion doubling problem , which leads to the loss of supersymmetry  inevitably broken by the discretization  even in the continuum limit . for a posible resolution of this puzzle ,",
    "see  @xcite . moreover , repeating the above derivation of the string hamiltonian   by truncation to the lowest modes corresponding to the operators @xmath274 and the fermions ,",
    "apparently does not lead to the correct string hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "finally , let me briefly discuss the issue of holography on the plane wave .",
    "as already mentioned , the conformal boundary of @xmath19 in global coordinates is @xmath193 on which the dual sym theory lives .",
    "however , in the penrose - gven limit one focuses on the neighborhood of a null geodesic located at the origin of @xmath28 and rotating around a great circle of the @xmath25 .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that the conformal boundary of the plane wave is a one - dimensional null line .",
    "this can be seen by a conformal mapping of the plane wave to the einstein static universe @xmath275 .",
    "since the einstein static universe is regular , the boundary consists of the space - time region for which the weyl factor is divergent .",
    "this is the case for a null line , a @xmath276 inside the @xmath277 shrinks to zero size and the spatial projection of the null line is a circle on the @xmath277  @xcite .",
    "one can picture this as a line winding in time on the einstein cylinder , see  @xcite . for a thorough discussion of the causal structure of more general pp - wave geometries , which are not conformally flat and hence the above trick of identifying the boundary by a conformal mapping does not work , see  @xcite . for a large class of pp - waves satisfying certain conditions , the boundary is again one - dimensional . the conformal boundaries and geodesics of @xmath19 and the plane wave and how the former approach the latter in the penrose limit have been analyzed in  @xcite .",
    "so the boundary of the plane wave is a null line , whereas sym lives on @xmath193 before the limit is taken . here",
    "one should recall again that the geodesic is rotating on the @xmath25 , so when projected on the boundary it is time - like and can be identified with @xmath278 . as the @xmath194 has disappeared in the process",
    "this supports the expectation  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) that the holographic dual of string theory on the plane wave is a quantum mechanical matrix model obtained by a truncation of sym on the @xmath194 .",
    "it would be nice to gain a precise understanding in which sense such a truncation can be consistently performed , see also  @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach , the construction of a holographic screen consisting of a four - dimensional hypersurface in the plane wave , was followed in  @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to understand if this has some connection to  @xcite , where supersymmetric d3-branes and @xmath20 sym on a four - dimensional plane wave , arising from a penrose limit of @xmath193 , was studied .",
    "for further remarks on holography in the plane wave see  @xcite .",
    "one would also like to go beyond the comparison of masses vs. anomalous dimensions in both theories .",
    "some ideas in this respect have been formulated in  @xcite ( see however , also  @xcite ) , a consistent truncation of sym in the bmn limit would suggest to compare finite time transition amplitudes in this model to string amplitudes on the plane wave .",
    "it is an interesting question whether the bmn proposal is applicable to other less trivial backgrounds .",
    "can the string spectrum in less supersymmetric situations again be deduced from a subsector of a dual gauge theory with reduced , possibly even no supersymmetry ?",
    "this question was addressed in several publications  @xcite appearing shortly after  @xcite . recall that orbifolds of type iib string theory on @xmath19  @xcite provide a simple way to reduce the amount of supersymmetry in the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "for example , the world - volume theory of @xmath279 d3-branes located at the @xmath280 orbifold singularity of an ale space is a @xmath30 @xmath281^k$ ] quiver gauge theory  @xcite which is dual to string theory on @xmath282  @xcite .",

    "this theory is dual to string theory on @xmath287 , @xmath288 being the base of the conifold .    what happens if we apply the penrose - gven limit to these situations ?",
    "let me sketch the case of @xmath287 which was studied in  @xcite .",
    "topologically @xmath288 is a @xmath289 bundle over @xmath290 and its @xmath291 isometry is identified with a @xmath292 global symmetry and @xmath197 symmetry of the dual superconformal field theory  @xcite .",
    "the surprising result found in  @xcite is that blowing up the neighborhood of a null geodesic rotating around the @xmath289 fiber one ends up with the maximally supersymmetric plane wave background again .",
    "consequently a subsector of the gauge theory with enhancement from @xmath27 to @xmath20 supersymmetry should emerge in the bmn limit .",

    "all these combinations remain fixed in the limit , similarly to @xmath213 in the @xmath20 case . in particular the sector in the @xmath27 theory with supersymmetry enhancement is specified by  @xcite @xmath302 one can explicitly identify these operators in the gauge theory .",
    "the matter content consists of chiral multiplets @xmath303 and @xmath304 with @xmath299-charge 1/2 and conformal dimension @xmath305 transforming as @xmath306 and @xmath307 under the global symmetry .",

    "further discussion of supersymmetry enhancement in @xmath27 theories arising from various orbifolds of @xmath25 and @xmath288 can be found in  @xcite .    however , supersymmetry enhancement is not a generic feature , as can be seen from the examples involving @xmath30 @xmath281^k$ ] quiver gauge theory  @xcite ( the case @xmath311 has also been discussed in  @xcite ) .",

    "a precise statement is the following : if the null geodesic is fixed by the group action , the resulting space - time will be an orbifold of the plane wave ; if this is not the case one recovers the pure plane wave again  @xcite . following the logic above this means that strings on plane waves can also arise in a sector of @xmath30 theory with enhancement to @xmath20 .",

    "the picture that emerges is quite suggestive : strings carrying momentum are described by operators winding around a large quiver circle , whereas strings with non - zero winding are dual to operators which carry ` momentum ' ( the phase ) .",
    "indeed it was argued in  @xcite , using t - duality , that the ` strings ' winding the quiver circle _ are _ so called non - relativistic winding strings in the t - dual description .",

    "this system is exactly solvable  @xcite .",

    "apart from being an interesting example with less supersymmetry , a further motivation comes from the fact that , as shown in  @xcite , the plane wave background acts as a harmonic oscillator potential to the string , and hence the dynamical distinction between untwisted and twisted states is less clear .",
    "it is thus of intrinsic interest to see if one can find a precise map between type iib string oscillation modes and quiver gauge theory operators , both for untwisted and twisted sectors .",

    "solutions to the resulting field equations describe the embedding of the d - brane into the target space . finally , at low energies d - branes arise as solitonic solutions to the supergravity equations of motion .",
    "all of these different approaches have been used to obtain a rather detailed picture of supersymmetric d - branes in the plane wave background via open strings in light - cone gauge  @xcite , covariant open strings  @xcite , boundary states  @xcite and the open - closed consistency conditions  @xcite , d - brane embeddings  @xcite and supergravity solutions  @xcite ( for a supergravity analysis of branes in the pp - wave space - time originating from the penrose limit of @xmath439 , see e.g.  @xcite ) .",

    "the condition on @xmath14 is equivalent to @xmath443 and thus leads to an analogous splitting of transverse coordinates as found from the open string analysis  @xcite .",
    "the allowed values for @xmath111 are @xmath458 , 3 , 5 and moreover , the condition   is only satisfied if @xmath459 , otherwise only half of the kinematical supercharges are preserved .",
    "a detailed analysis and proof of the open - closed consistency conditions was given in  @xcite .",
    "in flat space the cylinder diagram can be expressed in terms of certain standard @xmath460-functions and open - closed duality arises as a consequence of the properties of @xmath460-functions under modular transformations . in the plane wave",
    "the cylinder diagram involves deformed @xmath460-functions , where the deformation depends on the mass parameter  @xcite .",
    "it has been proven in  @xcite that these deformed @xmath460-functions satisfy certain transformation properties that assure that the open - closed consistency conditions are precisely satisfied for the half - supersymmetric branes . on the other hand , branes away from the origin , i.e.those preserving only half of the kinematical supercharges , appeared to violate open - closed duality and hence be inconsistent .",
    "it is also worthwhile to note , that the kinematical conditions   are not preserved as a function of time @xmath42",
    "@xcite . indeed",
    ", the open string kinematical supercharge does not commute with the hamiltonian and hence is spectrum generating as is the case for closed strings .",
    "the open string ground state is an unmatched boson  @xcite and it follows that the open string partition function does not vanish  @xcite .",
    "boundary states for d@xmath457 and the analysis of open - closed duality was considered in  @xcite ; independently this class was studied in detail in  @xcite from the open string side . as mentioned above",
    ", these branes also arose in the supergravity analysis  @xcite and from the covariant open string  @xcite . in this case",
    "the condition on @xmath14 is equivalent to @xmath461 , @xmath462 , however the coupling of @xmath463 and @xmath464-branes to the background flux induces a flux on the world - volume  @xcite and correspondingly the boundary conditions for bosons have to be modified . from the analysis of  @xcite it seems that the only consistent boundary state with standard bosonic boundary conditions is the @xmath465 at any position , i.e.  the d - instanton .",
    "again , this is in agreement with the open string analysis of  @xcite where the corresponding object , the d1-brane , is found to preserve half of the dynamical supersymmetries at any position . in this case",
    "the kinematical conditions   are preserved as a function of time @xmath42",
    "@xcite , corresponding to a vanishing mass term for the open string zero - modes .",
    "hence in this case the ground states form a degenerate supermultiplet and the open string partition function vanishes  @xcite",
    ".    however , this might not be the full story yet  @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is that the world - sheet theory being free , it possesses an countably infinite set of world - sheet symmetries .",
    "these simply correspond to transformations shifting the fields by a parameter satisfying the free field equations . for the open string",
    "such a shift changes the action by a boundary term , so it is a symmetry if it satisfies appropriate boundary conditions . as shown in  @xcite",
    "the dynamical supercharges broken by d@xmath456-branes located outside the origin and the kinematical supercharges broken by the d1-brane can be combined with world - sheet transformations that generate a _ non - vanishing _",
    "boundary term in such a way that the combined transformation _ is _ a symmetry of the open string . together with open string symmetries originating from closed string symmetries compatible with the boundary conditions they generate a superalgebra similar to that of the other half - supersymmetric branes  @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the boundary states for d@xmath456-branes located outside the origin showed that these do preserve a combination of eight dynamical and kinematical closed string supercharges in addition to the eight standard kinematical ones .",
    "it would be interesting to see whether these d@xmath456-branes turn out to be consistent with open - closed duality .",
    "the bmn correspondence can be extended to open strings  @xcite .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that the d@xmath456-branes located at the origin , descend from supersymmetric @xmath128 embeddings in @xmath19 through the penrose limit ; these originate from the near - horizon limit of supersymmetric intersections of the d@xmath111-branes with a stack of d3-branes .",
    "for example , in the near - horizon limit , a suitable d3-d5 system leads to a d5 wrapping a @xmath466 submanifold in @xmath19 .",
    "ads / cft is then supposed to act twice and the holographic dual is sym coupled to a three - dimensional defect .",
    "the defect theory lives on the boundary of @xmath467 and as such is a cft .",
    "the physics of closed strings and 5 - 5 open strings is described by the bulk theory , whereas the boundary theory captures 3 - 3 , 3 - 5 and 5 - 3 strings  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the 3 - 5 and 5 - 3 strings give rise to hypermultiplets in the fundamental of the gauge group . applying the penrose limit results in the d5 @xmath468 brane at the origin .",
    "the dual description is through the bmn limit of sym coupled to the three - dimensional defect .",
    "the closed string vacuum is dual to the trace of @xmath224 s and intuitively one expects the open string vacuum also to be dual to a large number of @xmath224 s , but instead of the trace with ` quarks ' at the end of the ` string ' .",
    "this is indeed the case , the ` quarks ' are scalars in the hypermultiplet originating from 3 - 5 and 5 - 3 strings and @xmath469 represents the open string vacuum  @xcite .",
    "open string excitations are then dual to insertions of defect fields and , for non - zero - modes , in analogy with the insertion of phases for the closed string , cosines and sines for neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the d7 @xmath470 was discussed in  @xcite , this is more involved as orientifold planes have to be added to have a consistent theory , but the basic idea remains the same .",
    "a further interesting example is the giant graviton , i.e.  a d3-brane wrapped on a @xmath194 in the @xmath25 , which in the penrose limit gives rise to the @xmath471 brane . here",
    "the open string fluctuations arise from subdeterminant operators in sym with large @xmath299-charge , see  @xcite for details .",
    "so far we have seen that we can get solvable string theories in light - cone gauge turning on null , _ constant _ field - strengths in a plane wave geometry . as first discussed in  @xcite , a large class of _ interacting _ string models with world - sheet supersymmetry ,",
    "can be engineered in more general pp - wave geometries with _ non - constant _ fluxes and possibly transverse spaces with special holonomy ; for example @xmath472 and all other background fields set to zero .",
    "it is convenient to split the candidate killing spinor @xmath473 into two parts of opposite @xmath183 chiralities , @xmath474 . analyzing the gravitino variation",
    ", one finds that @xmath475 is independent of all the coordinates ; at lowest order in @xmath40 this is the supernumerary spinor we encountered before and gives rise to linearly realized supersymmetry on the world - sheet in light - cone gauge . on the other hand ,",
    "it is useful to split @xmath476 into two parts as well : one , independent of @xmath42 ( and @xmath76 ) is determined through @xmath475 by the killing equation , see  @xcite for the explicit solution .",
    "this completes the supernumerary killing spinor for non - constant @xmath40 , however , as it is annihilated by @xmath477 it does not survive as part of the linearly realized supersymmetry in light - cone gauge . depending on @xmath40 one",
    "might also have a number of kinematical supersymmetries ; these correspond to the part of @xmath476 depending only on @xmath42 and solving the killing equation with @xmath478 ; they imply that an even number of fermions ( and hence also bosons ) are free on the world - sheet and decouple from the remaining interacting fields .",
    "generically there will be no kinematical supersymmetries .",
    "if the transverse space is curved , space - time supersymmetry requires it to have special holonomy .",
    "for example , for solutions with at least @xmath479 world - sheet supersymmetry the most general possibility is a calabi - yau four - fold .",
    "the killing spinor equation determines the bosonic potential @xmath36 in terms of @xmath40 and imposes additional constraints on the allowed four - forms . for @xmath479",
    "the solution is parameterized in terms of a holomorphic function @xmath480 and a real , harmonic killing potential @xmath102 .",
    "moreover , the lie - derivative of @xmath480 along the holomorphic killing vector @xmath481 has to vanish  @xcite .",
    "explicitly , the general solution leading to @xmath479 world - sheet theories in light - cone gauge is  @xcite @xmath482 holomorphicity of @xmath480 follows because the @xmath483 forms in the @xmath484 of @xmath485 are co - closed , whereas @xmath102 is harmonic due to tracelessness of the @xmath486 forms in the @xmath487 . to get interesting interacting world - sheet theories the transverse space needs to be non - compact  @xcite .",
    "as the geometry is that of a pp - wave , one can still choose the light - cone gauge ; the form of the resulting world - sheet theory is dictated by supersymmetry  @xcite .",
    "notice that , pp - wave string theories do not lead to the most general 2d supersymmetric field theories : the target space is always eight - dimensional of special holonomy and the killing potential @xmath102 has to be harmonic due to the self - duality of @xmath71 . turning on an additional null",
    "three - form leads to a second killing vector ( commuting with the first one ) , and again the corresponding potential is harmonic as a consequence of the variation of the dilatino  @xcite . in the case of @xmath488",
    "the transverse space has spin(7 ) holonomy , one gets a real harmonic superpotential  @xcite and , if the three - form is non - zero , one harmonic killing potential  @xcite .",
    "this general class of pp - wave solutions of type iib supergravity is interesting for several reasons .",
    "they are _ exact _ string solutions , i.e.  they do not receive @xmath489 corrections . in particular this",
    "is true for the plane wave background , see  @xcite for a proof based on the pure spinor approach for a covariant description of strings in backgrounds . in semi - light - cone gauge , conformal invariance of the",
    "gs superstring on the plane wave has also been studied in  @xcite .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , for the pp - wave space - times it is more advantageous to use the @xmath490 formalism , where strings are governed by exact _ interacting _",
    "@xmath491 superconformal world - sheet theories .",
    "this proves the exactness of this general class of solutions , see also  @xcite for an extension to a larger class of backgrounds , some of which can not be studied in light - cone gauge . for an alternative argument , based on space - time properties , essentially",
    "the existence of a covariantly constant null vector , see  @xcite .",
    "another interesting feature is the possibility to choose the superpotential such that the world - sheet theory becomes integrable  @xcite ; in that case one may hope to use known properties of integrable models to learn about strings propagating in these backgrounds , see also  @xcite for further discussions and examples .",
    "d - branes in these backgrounds have been analyzed in  @xcite , for example for @xmath479 branes are supersymmetric if they wrap complex manifolds and the superpotential ( and killing potential ) are constant on the world - volume ; one can also have supersymmetric d5-branes wrapped on special lagrangian submanifolds and appropriate conditions on the potentials .",
    "these results were derived in  @xcite in two ways , in the same spirit i described in the previous section : by analyzing supersymmetry preserving boundary conditions in the world - sheet theory and by finding supersymmetric embeddings in target space .",
    "interestingly , for the special case of the plane wave , the branes found in  @xcite are ` oblique ' , that is they are oriented in directions that couple the two transverse @xmath81 s ; these however , generically preserve less supersymmetry than the branes considered in the previous section .",
    "recently ` oblique ' branes in the plane wave background have been analysed in detail in  @xcite .",
    "in the previous two sections i have among other things discussed and explained how free strings on the plane wave background and its orbifold arise in a double - scaling limit of @xmath20 sym and @xmath30 quiver gauge theory , respectively . a computation of the anomalous dimensions of bmn single - trace operators in interacting _ planar _ @xmath20 sym  @xcite reproduces the mass spectrum of _ free _ string theory  @xcite .",
    "it is obviously an interesting question how string interactions and the non - planar sector of ( interacting ) gauge theory will fit into this picture . before going into details",
    "let me first make a few general remarks .",
    "the proposed duality between free string theory and planar , interacting @xmath20 sym in the bmn limit @xmath492 should encompass interactions and non - planar effects , respectively .",
    "this follows from the fact that the global symmetries of both sides of the duality are not expected to be broken by quantum effects and hence the relation   should hold to all orders in the string coupling as a consequence of the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite . as the two operators act on different hilbert spaces , this identity should be interpreted with some care .",
    "one information encoded in   is the identification of eigenvalues of the two operators .",
    "this is a basis - independent statement , on both sides of the duality we can choose any suitable basis , compute the matrix elements of the operator and obtain the eigenvalues by diagonalization .",
    "subsequently the corresponding eigenstates can be identified ( up to degeneracy ambiguities ) .",
    "recall once more the relations @xmath493 as already stated , considering planar ( @xmath234 ) gauge theory for small @xmath219 is equivalent to free ( @xmath494 ) string theory for large @xmath495 .",
    "now what happens if we take @xmath233 to be non - zero in the _ free _ gauge theory ?",
    "we see from   that this means to take @xmath496 , @xmath497 , such that @xmath498 is finite . as single- and multi - string states",
    "are orthogonal to each other , whereas single - trace bmn operators start to mix with multi - trace ones at finite @xmath233 in the free gauge theory  @xcite , the identification of states with operators is modified for finite @xmath233 . the fact that the required transformation is not unique  @xcite can be intuitively understood from string theory , because string states become highly degenerate for @xmath499 .",
    "taking into account string interactions is equivalent to considering non - planar , _ interacting _ gauge theory .",
    "then the freedom of mixing is getting more constrained because the dual operators now have to be eigenstates of the interacting dilatation operator .",
    "the ambiguity is still present for protected operators or ones where the interaction does not lift degeneracies present in the free theory .",
    "as we are only able to obtain the free string spectrum in light - cone gauge , we should ask how interactions can be studied in this picture . in flat space , the usual strategy is the vertex operator approach and the difficulties associated with the fact that @xmath76 is quadratic in the transverse coordinates are circumvented by using the ten - dimensional lorentz invariance to set @xmath500 in general scattering amplitudes .",
    "however , in the plane wave background transverse momentum is not a good quantum number due to the harmonic oscillator potential confining the string to the origin of transverse space .",
    "moreover ten - dimensional lorentz invariance is broken by the non - zero flux , in particular there is no @xmath501 generator .",
    "this obstruction significantly hinders the vertex operator approach to string interactions .",
    "there is only one other known way of studying string interactions in light - cone gauge , namely light - cone string field theory pioneered by mandelstam  @xcite for the bosonic string , see also  @xcite , and extended to the superstring in  @xcite . the construction of light - cone string field theory in the plane wave geometry  @xcite and the derivation of the leading non - planar correction to the anomalous dimension of bmn operators with two defects ( cf .",

    "one possible resolution of this discrepancy was to think about a modification of the string vertex .",
    "another possibility is of course to abandon the proposal of  @xcite which was not derived from first principles .",
    "in fact , i will show in section  [ ch6 ] that using the identification in equation  , the anomalous dimension of bmn operators transforming as @xmath651 under @xmath272 _ is _ reproduced in string theory using the vertex with fermionic zero - mode part as in  . a second ( related ) reason",
    "was based on the fact that the plane wave has a discrete @xmath214 symmetry that exchanges the two transverse @xmath195 s .",
    "this discrete symmetry should be preserved by the interaction .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that the @xmath80 parity of @xmath652 is opposite to the one of @xmath607 .",
    "then it followed that we have to assign positive parity to @xmath607 in order to preserve the full transverse symmetry in the @xmath183 formulation .",
    "this seems strange , as @xmath652 has negative parity although it is the ground state of the theory .",
    "however , the spectrum of type iib string theory on the plane wave was analyzed in detail in  @xcite , in particular the precise correspondence between the lowest lying string states and the fluctuation modes of supergravity on the plane wave was established .",
    "it turns out that the state @xmath607 corresponds to the complex scalar arising from the dilaton - axion system , whereas the state @xmath652 corresponds to a complex scalar being a mixture of the trace of the graviton and the potential on one of the @xmath81 s , that is the chiral primary sector . as dilaton and axion",
    "are scalars under @xmath183 and the discrete @xmath214 is just a particular @xmath183 transformation , we see that the assignment of positive parity to @xmath607 appears to be correct .",
    "moreover , analysis of the interaction hamiltonian for the chiral primary sector shows that invariance of the hamiltonian under the @xmath80 requires the chiral primaries to have negative parity  @xcite .",
    "finally , the implications of this assignment on matrix elements of the cubic vertex were successfully tested from the gauge theory side in  @xcite .    in  @xcite the solution of the kinematical constraints in the @xmath272 formulation",
    "was extended to include the required prefactors for the three - string interaction vertex and dynamical supercharges .",

    ", i will keep on working with the @xmath183 formulation , though for computations involving fermionic oscillators the @xmath272 one is better suited .",

    "the sum over double - string states includes a double integral over light - cone momenta , one integral is trivial due to the string - length conservation of the cubic interaction and the factor of @xmath779 can be cancelled on both sides of equation  .",
    "the remaining sum is then the usual completeness relation for harmonic oscillators projected on physical states and we have ( @xmath780 ) @xmath781\\,.\\ ] ] the measure arises due to the fact that string states are delta - function normalized .",
    "it is important to note that in gauge theory the dilatation operator was diagonalized within the subspace of two - impurity bmn operators in perturbation theory in the t hooft coupling @xmath12 and then extrapolated to @xmath12 , @xmath782 .",
    "but it is not obvious that the large @xmath196 limit of the perturbation series in @xmath12 has to agree order by order with the perturbation series in @xmath219 , see for example  @xcite .",
    "indeed there is evidence from string theory that this is not the case : for large @xmath75 the denominator of the first term in equation   is of order @xmath783 in the impurity conserving channel , whereas it is of order @xmath784 in the impurity non - conserving one .",
    "however , as already noticed in  @xcite , matrix elements where the number of impurities changes by two are of order @xmath785 and , therefore potentially can contribute to the mass - shift at leading order , that is @xmath786 .",
    "notice that impurity non - conserving matrix elements being of order one , means actually @xmath787 and as the overall factor of @xmath75 is simply for dimensional reasons and should not be counted when translating to gauge theory ( cf .",
    "equation  ) implies contributions @xmath788 to matrix elements of the dilatation operator .",
    "it was observed in  @xcite that the contribution of the impurity non - conserving channel to   is linearly divergent .",
    "this is due to the fact that the large @xmath75 limit does not commute with the infinite sums over mode numbers ; for finite @xmath75 the divergence is regularized .",
    "so a linear divergence reflects a contribution @xmath789 and hence of order @xmath790 to the anomalous dimension .",
    "this constitutes a non - perturbative , ` stringy ' effect .",
    "it remains a very interesting challenge to investigate the contribution of the impurity non - conserving channel in detail .",
    "however , to reproduce the result   for the anomalous dimensions of two - impurity bmn operators in string theory one is led to a truncation of equation   to the impurity conserving channel  @xcite .",
    "this analysis will be performed below .",
    "the matrix element @xmath791 in the impurity conserving channel is non - zero only if the double - string state contains either two bosonic or two fermionic oscillators .",
    "the relevant projection operator is @xmath792 for the first case the fermionic contribution to the matrix elements is simple to determine . using a @xmath101-matrix representation in which @xmath793 ,",
    "the plane wave vacua @xmath794 are related to @xmath795 ( up to an irrelevant phase ) via @xmath796 directions @xmath797 and @xmath798 correspond to positive and negative chirality under @xmath272 , respectively .",
    "eight of the zero - modes in equation  , namely @xmath799 , @xmath800 and , say , @xmath801 , @xmath802 are saturated by @xmath641 , so to give a non - zero contribution the remaining four zero - modes must be contracted with the @xmath803 term in @xmath804 .",
    "hence , the fermionic contribution is @xmath805 one can show that @xmath806 in the @xmath101-matrix basis used here .",
    "the bosonic part of the matrix element is not difficult to evaluate and i will not go into details . using the large @xmath75 expansions for the bosonic neumann matrices  @xcite",
    "one finds , for example for @xmath807 , @xmath808 and the analogous expression for @xmath809 with an ( inessential ) overall minus sign . here",
    "@xmath810 can be split into a symmetric - traceless and a trace part .",
    "there is no contribution to the @xmath222 nor to @xmath759 .",
    "the sum over @xmath326 and the integral over @xmath811 can be done and the complete contribution of the impurity conserving channel with bosonic excitations at one - loop is @xmath812 the factors of @xmath813 and @xmath814 equal the normalization @xmath815 of the string states .",
    "thus the contribution to the @xmath756 and @xmath758 is in both cases  @xcite @xmath816 the second case with two fermionic oscillators in the double - string was not analyzed in  @xcite .",
    "for example , one has to evaluate the tensor @xmath817 for spinor indices belonging to different chiralities of @xmath272 .",
    "then @xmath817 is non - zero only if @xmath14 and @xmath4 are not in the same @xmath268 .",
    "the resulting contribution is the same as in equation   for the representation @xmath818 .      to have a non - zero contribution from @xmath768",
    "the intermediate states need to have an odd number of bosonic oscillators and an odd number of fermionic oscillators .",
    "thus the simplest contribution comes from the impurity conserving channel . in this case",
    "the projector is @xmath819 at leading order in @xmath75 one finds that for the bosonic part of the matrix element the zero - modes contribute only to the antisymmetric representations , whereas the non - zero - modes contribute to all representations . for the fermionic part of the matrix element",
    "a simple counting of zero - modes shows that only terms of order @xmath820 and @xmath821 in @xmath804 can contribute .",
    "one also needs to evaluate the tensor @xmath822 and the large @xmath75 expansion of the fermionic neumann matrices , which due to the relation to the bosonic neumann matrices  @xcite can be inferred from the latter .",
    "the final result is @xmath823 for the antisymmetric @xmath222 and @xmath824 and @xmath825 for the @xmath758 , @xmath756 and @xmath818 . summing the contributions of one - loop and contact diagrams we see that _ all _ ( bosonic ) two - impurity irreducible representations of @xmath272 get the same contribution to the mass - shift from the impurity - conserving channels @xmath826 this is in exact agreement with the gauge theory result of  @xcite , cf .  .",
    "the realization of bmn that the penrose limit of @xmath19 and the knowledge of the full string spectrum on the plane wave , allowed to study ads / cft  albeit in a special limit  beyond the supergravity approximation , has ignited a lot of activity .",
    "the purpose of this work was to give an overview over various developments that have taken place .",
    "in section  [ chapter2 ] i gave an introduction to the bmn correspondence .",
    "several aspects of this duality were discussed in some detail both from the string theory as well as the gauge theory point of view .",
    "extensions of the bmn duality to less trivial backgrounds have been the topic of section  [ chapter3 ] .",
    "having first considered several illustrative examples , we studied supersymmetric @xmath328 orbifolds of the plane wave space - time and showed that free string theory in the orbifolded plane wave is dual to a subsector of planar @xmath30 @xmath281^k$ ] quiver gauge theory .",
    "in particular , we gave an explicit identification of gauge theory operators and string states both in the untwisted and twisted sectors .",
    "as interesting examples of further aspects of string theory on pp - wave space - times , i discussed d - branes on the plane wave and string theory on pp - waves with non - constant fluxes and curved transverse spaces .    to investigate the bmn correspondence beyond the free string / planar gauge theory level , string interactions and the non - planar gauge theory sector have to be taken into account . in section  [ chapter4 ] string interactions in the plane wave background were studied in the framework of light - cone string field theory . at first order in the string coupling , interactions in this setup",
    "are encoded in a cubic vertex .",
    "we analyzed in detail the construction of this vertex as well as the dynamical supercharges and presented their complete expressions both in the oscillator as well as the continuum basis .",
    "we proved that these satisfy the plane wave superalgebra to first order in the string coupling . in the process",
    ", several results that had been known in flat space light - cone string field theory , e.g.  a factorization theorem for the bosonic neumann matrices , were generalized to the plane wave space - time .",
    "we used the vertex and supercharges to compute the leading order mass shift of certain string states in a truncation to the impurity - conserving channel .",
    "the result exactly agreed with the leading non - planar correction to the anomalous dimension of the dual operators in @xmath20 sym .",
    "there are a number of interesting problems we have encountered : for example , it would be nice to extend the computation of the mass shift for the simplest string states in section  [ ch6 ] beyond the contribution of the impurity - conserving channel .",
    "as i have explained , in the large @xmath75 limit this presumably translates to non - perturbative effects in the dual gauge theory .",
    "indeed , a non - vanishing contribution of order @xmath790 to the anomalous dimension would only constitute the leading term in a power series in fractional powers of @xmath219 ; verifying the presence of such a contribution could eventually lead to better understanding the nature of the bmn limit in @xmath20 sym .",
    "one should be aware , however , that even a computation of the leading order ` stringy ' effect along the lines of section  [ ch6 ] seems unfeasible , as infinitely many intermediate states have to be taken into account .",
    "so the way out seems to be to perform a full - fledged one - loop / contact term computation .",
    "again , this is difficult , as one has to compute the inverse of infinite - dimensional matrices ( involving e.g.  the product of two neumann matrices ) exactly , before taking the large @xmath75 limit .",
    "nevertheless , some progress might be achieved along the lines of  @xcite using the techniques developed there .",
    "it is natural to extend the research on light - cone string field theory to include open strings , i.e.  d - branes on the plane wave .",
    "in particular , as explained in section  [ dbranes ] , d@xmath456-branes outside the origin preserve dynamical supercharges which involve certain world - sheet symmetries  @xcite . one way to understand",
    "the consistency of these branes in the presence of interactions is to construct the corresponding cubic open string interaction vertex : for d@xmath456 branes at the origin this has been done in  @xcite .",
    "in fact , recent analysis of the world - volume supersymmetries of m2-branes in the kg space suggests that these additional dynamical supercharges are not respected by string interactions , see  @xcite for details . of course , open / closed string interactions are interesting as well given the expected duality to the bmn limit of @xmath20 sym coupled to defect conformal field theories . here",
    "studies have been initiated in  @xcite .",
    "as we have seen , the light - cone gs action is well - suited to obtain the spectrum of string theories in simple backgrounds with flux .",
    "although the construction of the cubic interaction vertex is technically quite involved , it is a viable possibility to study simple tree- and  at least in the approximation described in section  [ ch6 ]  one - loop interactions .",
    "however , as discussed in  @xcite , even for studying higher point tree - amplitudes in flat space this approach is not useful , as the vertex explicitly depends on the interaction point .",
    "moreover , it is difficult to describe physical states with vanishing @xmath189 in the light - cone formalism .",
    "these caveats become even more problematic for backgrounds without the full lorentz isometry , such as the plane wave .",
    "it appears to be a worthwhile prospect to use the @xmath490 formalism as advocated in  @xcite to overcome some of these drawbacks . in this",
    "approach strings on the plane wave are described by an exact _ interacting _ @xmath491 superconformal field theory and standard cft techniques may be used for computations .",
    "one can also naturally describe strings in the more general pp - wave geometries of section  [ massive ] in this setup , which makes this approach potentially even more interesting .",
