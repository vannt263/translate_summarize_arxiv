    "a major outstanding problem in nuclear physics is to calculate properties of finite nuclei starting from the basic interactions among nucleons .",
    "this problem has two parts .",
    "first , the basic interactions among nucleons are complicated .",
    "they are not uniquely defined and there is clear evidence that more than just two - nucleon forces are important .",
    "second , the nuclear many - body problem is very difficult to solve .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the complex nature of the inter - nucleon interactions .",
    "both short - range and medium - range correlations among nucleons are important and for some observables long - range correlations also play a significant role .    in this review , we focus mainly on the second part of the problem , namely on the solution of the many - nucleon problem .",
    "the two - nucleon interactions we take as an input provided to us by other theorists .",
    "we do , however , utilize three- and many - nucleon calculations to determine parameters of three - nucleon interactions .",
    "we also note that , in general , few - nucleon and many - nucleon calculations provide feedback to those constructing potentials .",
    "various methods have been used to solve the few - nucleon problem in the past .",
    "the faddeev method @xcite has been successfully applied to solve the three - nucleon bound - state as well as the scattering problem for different nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) potentials @xcite . for",
    "the solution of the four - nucleon problem one can employ yakubovsky s generalization of the faddeev formalism @xcite , as done , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite or @xcite .",
    "alternatively , other methods have also been succesfully used , such as , the correlated hyperspherical harmonics expansion method @xcite or the green s function monte carlo method ( gfmc ) @xcite .",
    "recently , a benchmark calculation by seven different methods was performed for a four - nucleon bound state problem @xcite giving the same result within error . however , there are few approaches that can be successfully applied to solve the bound - state problem in systems of more than four nucleons , when realistic inter - nucleon interactions are used .",
    "these include the green s function monte carlo method , which is capable of solving the nuclear many - body problem with realistic interactions for systems of up to @xmath0 and the coupled cluster method @xcite , which is applicable typically to closed - shell and nearby nuclei .",
    "the solution of the nuclear many - body problem is still more complex when scattering or nuclear reactions are considered . for @xmath1 and 4 nucleon systems , the faddeev and faddeev - yakubovsky as well as the hyperspherical harmonics ( hh ) @xcite or the alt , grassberger and sandhas ( ags ) @xcite methods are applicable and successful .",
    "however , _ ab initio _",
    "calculations for scattering processes involving more than four nucleons overall are challenging and still a rare exception  @xcite .",
    "nuclei are open systems with bound states , weakly bound halo states , unbound resonances as well as scattering states",
    ". a realistic _ ab initio _ description of light nuclei with predictive power must have a capability to describe all the above classes of states within a unified framework .",
    "coupling to the continuum can not be neglected .    in this review",
    ", we describe the _ ab initio _ no - core shell model ( ncsm ) @xcite , another method for solving the nuclear many - body problem developed recently and applicable to light nuclei up to @xmath2 and beyond .",
    "the first no - core shell model calculations  @xcite were performed with g - matrix - based two - body interactions  @xcite . later , the okubo - lee - suzuki procedure  @xcite was implemented to derive two - body effective interactions for the ncsm  @xcite .",
    "this resulted in the elimination of the purely phenomenological parameter used to define the g - matrix starting energy . a truly _",
    "ab initio _ formulation of the approach was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where convergence to the exact bound - state solutions was demonstrated for the @xmath1 system . here ,",

    "[ sec : chiral_nn_nnn ] , we show recent results obtained with the chiral nn plus three - nucleon ( nnn ) interactions",

    "[ sec : mom ] . in sect .",
    "[ sec : ext ] , we describe efforts to extend the applicability of the ncsm to heavier nuclei . in the second part of the review in sections  [ sec : overlap]-[sec : ncsmc ] , we discuss in detail new developments and outline future efforts to extend the ncsm by including continuum states to describe unbound states , scattering and nuclear reactions in a unified framework .",
    "conclusions are given in sect .",
    "[ sec : concl ] .",
    "in the _ ab initio _ no - core shell model , we consider a system of @xmath3 point - like non - relativistic nucleons that interact by realistic two- or two- plus three - nucleon interactions . by the term `` realistic two - nucleon interactions '' , we mean nn potentials that fit nucleon - nucleon phase shifts with high precision up to a certain energy , typically up to 350 mev .",
    "a realistic nnn interaction includes terms related to two - pion exchanges with an intermediate delta excitation . in the ncsm ,",
    "all the nucleons are considered active , there is no inert core like in standard shell model calculations .",
    "hence , the `` no - core '' in the name of the approach .",
    "there are two other major features in addition to the employment of realistic nn or nn+nnn interactions .",
    "the first one is the use of the harmonic oscillator ( ho ) basis , truncated by a chosen maximal total ho energy of the @xmath3-nucleon system .",
    "the reason behind the choice of the ho basis is the fact that this is the only basis that allows for the use of single - nucleon coordinates and , consequently , the second - quantization representation , without violating the translational invariance of the system .",
    "the powerful techniques based on the second quantization and developed for standard shell model calculations can then be utilized .",
    "therefore , the `` shell model '' in the name of the approach . as a downside , one has to face the consequences of the incorrect asymptotic behavior of the ho basis .",
    "the second feature comes as a result of the basis truncation .",
    "standard , accurate nn potentials , such as the argonne v18 ( av18 ) @xcite , cd - bonn 2000 @xcite , inoy ( inside non - local outside yukawa ) @xcite and , to some extent , also the chiral n@xmath4lo @xcite , generate strong short - range correlations that can not be accomodated even in a reasonably large ho basis . in order to account for these short - range correlations and to speed up convergence with the basis enlargement , we construct an effective interaction from the original , realistic nn or nn+nnn potentials by means of a unitary transformation .",
    "the effective interaction depends on the basis truncation and by construction becomes the original , realistic nn or nn+nnn interaction as the size of the basis approaches infinity .",
    "recently , a new class of soft potentials has been developed , mostly by means of unitary transformations of the standard , accurate nn potentials mentioned above .",
    "these include the @xmath5 @xcite , the similarity renormalization group ( srg ) @xcite and the ucom @xcite nn potentials .",
    "a different class of soft phenomenological nn potential used in some ncsm calculations are the jisp potentials based on inverse scattering  @xcite .",
    "these soft potentials are to some extent already renormalized for the purpose of simplifying many - body calculations .",
    "therefore , we can perform convergent ncsm calculations with these potentials unmodified , or `` bare . '' in fact , the chiral n@xmath4lo nn potential @xcite can also be used bare with some success .",
    "ncsm calculations with bare potentials are variational with the ho frequency and the basis truncation parameter as variational parameters .",
    "the starting hamiltonian of the _ ab initio _ ncsm is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the nucleon mass , @xmath8 is the nn interaction , and @xmath9 is the three - nucleon interaction . in the ncsm , we employ a large but finite ho basis .",
    "when soft nn potentials are used , it is often feasible to employ a sufficiently large basis to reach convergence with the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) .    on the other hand , if realistic nuclear interactions that generate strong short - range correlations are used in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) , we must derive an effective interaction appropriate for the basis truncation . to facilitate the derivation of the effective interaction , we modify the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) by adding to it the center - of - mass ( cm ) ho hamiltonian @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "the effect of the ho cm hamiltonian will later be subtracted out in the final many - body calculation . due to the translational invariance of the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) , the ho cm hamiltonian has in fact no effect on the intrinsic properties of the system .",
    "the modified hamiltonian can be cast into the form @xmath13   + \\sum_{i < j}^a \\left [ v_{{\\rm nn } , ij } -\\frac{m\\omega^2}{2a } ( \\vec{r}_i-\\vec{r}_j)^2 \\right ]   \\nonumber \\\\   & & + \\sum_{i < j < k}^a v_{{\\rm nnn } , ijk } \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      in the _ ab initio _ ncsm , we use a ho basis that allows preservation of translational symmetry of the nuclear self - bound system , even if single - nucleon coordinates are utilized .",
    "this is possible as long as the basis is truncated by a maximal total ho energy of the @xmath3-nucleon system .",
    "a further advantage is that the ho wave functions have important transformation properties  @xcite that facilitate and simplify calculations .",
    "a single - nucleon ho wave function can be written as @xmath14 with @xmath15 , the radial ho wave function , and @xmath16 , the ho length parameter related to the ho frequency @xmath17 as @xmath18 , with @xmath7 the nucleon mass .    because the nn and nnn interactions depend on relative coordinates and/or momenta , the natural coordinates in the nuclear problem are the relative , or jacobi , coordinates .",

    "as nucleons are fermions , we need to construct an antisymmetrized basis . the way to do this ,",
    "when the jacobi - coordinate ho basis is used , is extensively discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we briefly illustrate how to do this for the simplest case of three nucleons .",
    "one starts by introducing a ho basis that depends on the jacobi coordinates @xmath24 and @xmath25 , defined in eqs .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , e.g. , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the ho quantum numbers corresponding to the harmonic oscillators associated with the coordinates ( and the corresponding momenta ) @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively . the quantum numbers @xmath28 describe the spin , isospin and angular momentum of the relative - coordinate two - nucleon channel of nucleons 1 and 2 , while @xmath29 is the angular momentum of the third nucleon relative to the center of mass of nucleons 1 and 2 .",
    "the @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the total angular momentum and the total isospin , respectively .",
    "note that the basis ( [ hobas ] ) is antisymmetrized with respect to the exchanges of nucleons 1 and 2 , as the two - nucleon channel quantum numbers are restricted by the condition @xmath32 .",
    "it is not , however , antisymmetrized with respect to the exchanges of nucleons @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in order to construct a completely antisymmetrized basis",
    ", one needs to obtain eigenvectors of the antisymmetrizer @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the cyclic and the anti - cyclic permutation operators , respectively .",
    "the antisymmetrizer @xmath38 is a projector satisfying @xmath39 .",
    "when diagonalized in the basis ( [ hobas ] ) , its eigenvectors span two eigenspaces .",
    "one , corresponding to the eigenvalue 1 , is formed by physical , completely antisymmetrized states and the other , corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 , is formed by spurious states .",
    "there are about twice as many spurious states as the physical ones @xcite .    due to the antisymmetry with respect to the exchanges @xmath40 ,",
    "the matrix elements in the basis ( [ hobas ] ) of the antisymmetrizer @xmath38 can be evaluated simply as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the transposition operator corresponding to the exchange of nucleons 2 and 3 .",
    "its matrix element can be evaluated in a straightforward way ( see e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath43 ; @xmath44 ; and @xmath45 ) can be derived by examining the action of @xmath42 on the basis states ( [ hobas ] ) . that operator changes the state @xmath46 to @xmath47 , where @xmath48 are defined as @xmath49 but with the single - nucleon indexes 2 and 3 exchanged .",
    "the primed jacobi coordinates can be expressed as an orthogonal transformation of the unprimed ones , see e.g. , ref .",
    "consequently , the ho wave functions depending on the primed jacobi coordinates can be expressed as an orthogonal transformation of the original ho wave functions .",
    "elements of the transformation are the generalized ho brackets for two particles with the mass ratio @xmath50 , with @xmath50 determined from the orthogonal transformation of the coordinates , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the resulting antisymmetrized states can be classified and expanded in terms of the original basis ( [ hobas ] ) as follows @xmath51 and where we have introduced an additional quantum number @xmath52 that distinguishes states with the same set of quantum numbers @xmath53 , e.g. , @xmath54 with @xmath55 the total number of antisymmetrized states for a given @xmath53 .",
    "the symbol @xmath56 is a coefficient of fractional parentage .",
    "a generalization to systems of more than three nucleons can be done as shown , e.g. in ref .",
    "it is obvious , however , that as we increase the number of nucleons , the antisymmetrization becomes more and more involved .",
    "consequently , in standard shell model calculations one utilizes antisymmetrized wave functions constructed in a straightforward way as slater determinants of single - nucleon wave functions depending on single - nucleon coordinates @xmath57 .",
    "it follows from the transformations of ho wave functions that the use of a slater determinant basis constructed from single nucleon ho wave functions , such as , @xmath58 results in eigenstates of a translationally invariant hamiltonian that factorize as products of a wave function depending on relative coordinates and a wave function depending on the cm coordinates .",
    "this is true as long as the basis truncation is done by a chosen maximum of the sum of all ho excitations , i.e. , @xmath59 . in eq .",
    "( [ howavesp ] ) , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are spin and isospin coordinates of the nucleon , respectively .",
    "the physical eigenstates of a translationally invariant hamiltonian can then be selected as eigenstates with the cm in the @xmath62 state : @xmath63 , the jacobi coordinate basis is more efficient , as one can perform the antisymmetrization easily .",
    "the cm degrees of freedom can be explicitly removed and a coupled @xmath64 basis can be utilized with matrix dimensions of the order of thousands . for systems with @xmath65 , it is , in general , more efficient to use the slater determinant ho basis . in fact , we use the so - called m - scheme basis with conserved quantum numbers @xmath66 , parity @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the antisymmetrization is trivial , but the dimensions can be huge , as the cm degrees of freedom are present , and no @xmath69 coupling is considered .",
    "the advantage is the possibility to utilize the powerful second - quantization technique , shell model codes , transition density codes and so on .",
    "as mentioned above , the model space truncation is always done using the condition @xmath59 .",
    "often , instead of @xmath70 , we introduce the parameter @xmath71 that measures the maximal allowed ho excitation energy above the unperturbed ground state . for @xmath72 systems @xmath73 . for the @xmath74-shell nuclei",
    "they differ , e.g. for @xmath75li , @xmath76 , for @xmath77c , @xmath78 , _",
    "etc_.      in the _ ab initio _ ncsm calculations we use a truncated ho basis , as discussed in previous sections .",
    "the inter - nucleon interactions act , however , in the full space .",
    "as long as one uses soft potentials , such as the @xmath5 , srg , ucom or jisp , convergent ncsm results can be obtained .",
    "such ncsm calculations are variational with the ho frequency and the basis truncation parameter @xmath71 acting as variational parameters .",
    "however , the situation is different when standard nn potentials that generate strong short - range correlations , such as av18 , cd - bonn 2000 , and inoy , are used , or when a not - large - enough @xmath71 truncation can be reached with the chiral n@xmath4lo nn potential ( in particular , when it is used in combination with the chiral nnn interaction ) . in order to obtain meaningful results in the truncated ( or model ) space ,",
    "the inter - nucleon interactions need to be renormalized .",
    "we need to construct an effective hamiltonian with the inter - nucleon interactions replaced by effective interactions . by meaningful results we understand results as close as possible to the full space exact results for a subset of eigenstates .",
    "mathematically we can construct an effective hamiltonian that exactly reproduces the full space results for a subset of eigenstates . in practice , we can not in general construct this exact effective hamiltonian for the @xmath3-nucleon problem we want to solve .",
    "however , we can construct an effective hamiltonian that is exact for a two - nucleon system or for a three - nucleon system or even for a four - nucleon system .",
    "the corresponding effective interactions can then be used in the @xmath3-nucleon calculations .",
    "their use , in general , improves the convergence of the problem to the exact full space result with the increase of the basis size . by construction",
    ", these effective interactions converge to the full - space inter - nucleon interactions , therefore , guaranteeing convergence to the exact solution , when the basis size approaches the infinite full space .    in our approach",
    "we employ the so - called okubo or lee - suzuki similarity transformation method @xcite , which yields a starting - energy independent hermitian effective interaction .",
    "we first recapitulate general formulation and basic results of this method .",
    "applications of this method for computation of two- or three - body effective interactions are described afterwards .",
    "let us consider an @xmath79 hamiltonian @xmath80 with the eigensystem @xmath81 , i.e. , @xmath82 let us further divide the full space into the model space defined by a projector @xmath83 and the complementary space defined by a projector @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "a similarity transformation of the hamiltonian @xmath86 can be introduced with a transformation operator @xmath87 satisfying the condition @xmath88 .",

    "@xcite was introduced , similar to the one applied to the hamiltonian .",
    "thus , the renormalization was implemented in relative coordinates , allowing the same treatment for general operators as for the hamiltonian , as long as the former can be written in relative coordinates @xcite .",
    "this implementation was tested on the deuteron , where the two - body cluster provides the exact solution . in that case , the bare quadrupole operator in @xmath194 gave 0.179 @xmath195 @xmath196 for the quadrupole moment , while the value of 0.270 @xmath195 @xmath196 , described by the av8 potential , was obtained using the corresponding effective operator in the same model space . however ,",

    "overall , the difference between the bare operator results in the @xmath199 and @xmath203 model spaces , coupled with the small renormalization at the two - body cluster level , indicate sizable effective many - body effects needed to correct the @xmath199 @xmath197 value .",

    "the kinetic energy is short range , while the quadrupole is long range ; at the two - body cluster level , the unitary transformation renormalizes mainly the short - range core of the interaction , leaving unchanged the long range part .",
    "hence , in order to account for long - range correlations in the two - body cluster approximation , one needs to enlarge the model space . to test this hypothesis ,",
    "a gaussian operator of variable range was used in ref .",
    "@xcite . there , by observing the variation with the model space / ho frequency of the expectation values calculated with the bare and effective operators for several different ranges",
    ", it was demonstrated that a short - range two - body operator is renormalized accurately at the two - body cluster level , while a long - range operator is weakly renormalized . to further illustrate the power of the unitary transformation approach to the renormalization of short - range operators , we turn to an observable probing short - range correlations .",
    "the inclusive @xmath204 longitudinal data presents one of the clearest experimental signatures for short - range correlations in the wave - function of the ground state , at least for light nuclei .",
    "a quantitative measure of the short - range correlations is the longitudinal - longitudinal distribution function ( connected to the coulomb sum rule ) @xcite    @xmath205 where @xmath206 is the spherical bessel function of zero order , and @xmath207 the momentum transfer .",
    "in figure [ he4rholl ] we present the results for the longitudinal - longitudinal distribution function for @xmath175he . at high momentum transfer ,",
    "the results obtained using bare operators depend strongly upon the model space . on the other hand ,",
    "the results obtained with effective operators are model space invariant at high @xmath207 , although in these model spaces the wave function is not fully converged , since the energy is not converged in these very small model spaces ( see fig . 3 in ref .",
    "they agree with the values computed in larger model spaces . at intermediate momentum transfer ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath208 @xmath209 , even the effective operator results vary .",
    "this effect is due to the fact that the long range part of the operator has not yet converged in these small model spaces . in larger model spaces ,",
    "where the long - range correlations are better described , the agreement is even better .",
    "similar results for the longitudinal - longitudinal distribution function have been obtained for @xmath77c , where calculations in very large model spaces are not possible . however , even in the smallest model space , @xmath62 , we were able to obtain good results for high momentum transfer , which reproduce the values in larger model spaces @xcite .    in conclusion , short - range operators ( high momentum transfer ) are very well renormalized and the results become model - space independent even in the two - body cluster approximation , while long - range operators , such as the quadrupole transition operator , or the longitudinal - longitudinal distribution function for small and intermediate momentum transfer , are only weakly renormalized .",
    "it all comes down to the effects of the unitary transformation , which , as discussed before , at the two - body level renormalizes only the short - range part of the interaction , while the long - range part is recovered in larger model spaces .",
    "interactions among nucleons are governed by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . in the low - energy regime relevant to nuclear structure ,",
    "qcd is non - perturbative , and , therefore , hard to solve .",

    "@xcite provides a promising bridge .",
    "beginning with the pionic or the nucleon - pion system  @xcite one works consistently with systems of increasing nucleon number  @xcite .",

    "in particular , we can generalize the expansion of the many - body wave function given in eq .",
    "( [ trial ] ) by explicitly including a set of @xmath3-nucleon ncsm eigenstates : @xmath314 where @xmath315 with @xmath316 given by , e.g. , @xmath317 of eq .",

    "it is straightforward to implement this new approach that we name _",
    "ab initio _ ncsm with the continuum ( ncsmc ) .",
    "the _ ab initio _ ncsm has evolved into a powerful many - body technique . in this review , we presented some of recent results obtained within this approach .",
    "we discussed , in particular , calculations with chiral eft nn and nnn interactions for both @xmath174-shell and @xmath74-shell nuclei used , on the one hand , as a tool to determine the nnn interaction low - energy constants and , on the other hand , to predict properties of light nuclei .",
    "these calculations demonstrate the importance of the nnn interaction for nuclear structure .",
    "recent advances in experimental techniques that allowed precise measurements of radii and moments of exotic isotopes motivated us to perform large basis ncsm calculations for he , li and be isotopes .",
    "these calculations were overviewed in this paper .",
    "we also described efforts to extend the ncsm calculations to larger model spaces and heavier nuclei by means of the importance - truncated calculations and by development of effective interactions for model spaces with a closed core .",
    "the most significant new developments , at least in our view , were discussed in the last part of this review .",
    "extension of the ncsm to describe scattering and nuclear reactions via the rgm technique serves as a bridge to a development of a unified _ ab initio _ description of light nuclei with both bound and unbound states described simultaneously and treated on the same footing .",
    "extensions of the ncsm / rgm formalism to include two - nucleon ( deuteron ) , three - nucleon ( triton and @xmath4he ) and four - nucleon ( @xmath175he ) projectiles are now under way . as a large ho basis expansion is needed in this formalism , not just for the convergence of the target and projectile eigenstates , but also for the convergence of the localized parts of the integration kernels , a combination of this approach with the importance - truncated ncsm is key in a successful application of the ncsm / rgm and the ncsm with the continuum to heavier nuclei .",
    "there are other developments in the ncsm calculations that were not covered by this review that deserves attention .",
    "one of them is the recent analysis of ncsm wave functions by means of the representations of the symplectic sp(3,r ) group  @xcite and attempts to develop an ncsm code for calculations within su(3 ) @xmath325 sp(3,r ) symmetry - adapted basis .",
    "this approach aims to augment the model space by nuclear collective correlations , which are required for a microscopic description of monopole and quadrupole vibrational and rotational dynamics .",
    "this would allow , in particular , a realistic description of giant quadrupole resonances .    further , the ncsm calculations were also used as a tool for development of the similarity renormalization group evolved nn interactions  @xcite and the ucom interactions  @xcite .",
    "also , the ncsm method was recently adapted for systems of strongly interacting bosons in a trap  @xcite .",
    "finally , there are remarkable advances in the development of the code mfd  @xcite .",
    "calculations on tens of thousands of processors are now possible  @xcite and results in model spaces up to @xmath326 for @xmath77c and @xmath327n with nn interactions are within reach  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , calculations in the @xmath269 model space with the nn and nnn interactions from section  [ sec : chiral_nn_nnn ] have already been performed for @xmath328 and @xmath329 nuclei .",
