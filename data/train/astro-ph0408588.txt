    "1996 , 2000 ) .",
    "classified as a luminous blue variable star ( lbv ) , @xmath0 car has presented eruptive events in which its wind parameters ( mass loss rate and ejection velocity ) were drastically increased in short periods of time ( maeder 1989 , pasquali et al . 1997 ) .",
    "its 20 yr great eruption ( in the 1840s ) , in which a few solar masses ( @xmath12 @xmath2 ) were expelled into the interstelar medium , formed two symmetrical lobes ( e.g. humphreys @xmath3 davidson 1994 ; davidson @xmath3 humphreys 1997 ) expanding with velocities @xmath1600 km s@xmath4 in the polar direction ( see , for instance , smith 2002 ; smith et al .",
    "the nebular axis forms an angle of @xmath5 with the line of sight ( davidson et al .",
    "2001 ) and at a distance of @xmath1 2.3 - 2.5 kpc , it has a total physical size @xmath6 cm .    in the 1890s ,",
    "a secondary eruptive event occurred in the @xmath0 car wind ( humphreys , davidson , @xmath3 smith 1999 ) .",
    "recent spectroscopic observations have revealed the presence of a bipolar nebula embedded within the homunculus , with an angular size of @xmath7 , which probably was formed from this minor eruption ( e.g. ishibashi et al .",
    "2003 ) in which @xmath10.1 @xmath2 were expelled by the star . in the polar direction of the inner nebula ( which also coincides with the homunculus axis ) , the expansion velocity of the shell is @xmath1300 km s@xmath4 . on the other hand ,",
    "the outer homunculus is also embedded within a low density , hot , gaseous , extended structure ( called the outer ejecta ) , which was probably produced from previous eruptive events of the star ( see , for instance , walborn et al .",
    "1978 , davidson & humphreys 1997 ; weis et al . 2001 ) , or by the remnants of the blast wave of the 1843 eruption ( weis 2004 ) .",
    "apart from the homunculus , the little homunculus , and the outer ejecta , observations of this source also reveal the presence of equatorial features that typically move with @xmath8 km s@xmath4 ( e.g. smith @xmath3 gehrz 1998 ; davidson et al .",
    "2001 ) , although higher - speed equatorial components have been also detected with velocities @xmath9 km s@xmath4 ( e.g. smith et al .",
    "2003a ) or even larger . these ejections may contain material from both the eruptions of the 1840s and 1890s ( e.g. davidson et al .",
    "2001 ; smith 2002 ) .",
    "bipolar nebulae are very common phenomena in astrophysics , surrounding not only lbvs , but also young stellar objects and low - mass stars in their late stages of evolution , like the planetary nebulae .",
    "their formation is still a matter of debate , particularly in lbvs ( e.g. , langer et al .",
    "1994 , 1999 ) , but in general they are attributed to the collision of stellar winds emanating from the central star ( e.g. , icke 1988 , frank & mellema 1994 ; frank et al .",
    "1995 , 1998 ; dwarkadas & balick 1998 ; langer et al .",
    "1999 ) .    to produce a nonspherical bipolar nebula",
    ", most models have assumed that a spherical fast wind expands into a nonspherical ( toroidal ) slow , dense wind previously ejected from the star .",
    "the high densities in the equatorial plane constrain the expansion of the fast wind in that direction and , if the density ratio between the equator and pole is high enough , the expanding spherical shell quickly becomes bipolar . the development of precursor ,",
    "nonspherical @xmath10 winds in massive stars is naturally explained by simply invoking stellar rotation and centrifugal forces ( e.g , maeder 1989 ) .",
    "however , @xmath11 winds with inherently nonspherical geometry also find theoretical support ( e.g. , frank et al . 1998 ; smith et al .",
    "2003a , smith et al .",
    "2004 , maeder 2004 ) .",
    "bjorkman & cassinelli ( 1992 ) showed that a strong equator - to - pole density contrast could form during the great eruption of @xmath0 car in the 1840s if the star was close to the eddington luminosity limit . in this limit , the wind is deflected towards the equator close to the star because the radiative and centrifugal forces balance gravity at the equator . in a model for",
    "be stars , pauldrach & puls ( 1990 ) showed that when the effective gravity of the star drops below a critical value , a discontinuity , denominated bi - stability , develops in mass and velocity .",
    "lamers & pauldrach ( 1991 ) have demonstrated that stellar rotation can induce latitudinal changes in the effective gravity and the optical depth of the wind that put the polar and equatorial regions on different sides of this bi - stability limit . as a consequence , a high - velocity",
    ", low - density wind should form at the poles , and a low - velocity , high - density wind should form at the equator . the lbv star ag carinae , for example , has a wind with these characteristics . on the other hand , quite oppositely , recent numerical models of radiative line - driven winds ( owocki et al . 1996 ; 1998 ; dwarkadas @xmath3 owocki 2002 ) , which are based on the wind - compressed disk mechanism but include the effects on non - radial line forces , have found that the equatorial density enhancement can be inhibited and instead , an enhanced mass flux is predicted to occur toward the poles .",
    "van boekel et al . (",
    "2003 ) present vlt and vlti observations of the present - day stellar wind of @xmath0 car that favor this model .",
    "they found evidence that the density contours in @xmath0 car s wind are elongated along the major axis of the homunculus .",
    "this alignment suggests that rotation may be responsible for the shape of the @xmath0 car bipolar nebula .",
    "all the results above show that there are several ways by which fast winds may become intrinsically nonspherical from the source . in the case of the @xmath0 car wind",
    ", the observed latitudinal variations in h and hei lines reveal that the speed , density and ionization are nonspherical near the star and indicate that its stellar wind is inherently nonspherical ( smith et al .",
    "2003a ) .",
    "alternative models to explain the @xmath0 car nebula bipolar shape have invoked a colliding wind binary star mechanism ( see , e.g. , soker 2001 ) . however ,",
    "an argument against a companion star @xmath12 the wind structure is its axial symmetry .",
    "recent stis spectral observations in several positions along the homunculus ( smith et al .",
    "2003a ) show the same latitudinal dependence for the velocities in both hemispheres and both sides of the polar axis , as well as , the same p cygni absorption in hydrogen lines on either side of the poles .",
    "also , the high velocities seen in reflected light from the polar lobes give some evidence that the polar axis of the homunculus is aligned with the rotation axis of the central star .",
    "this has important consequences for the formation of the bipolar lobes and the equatorial ejecta around @xmath0 car , as it may be an indication that axial symmetry and the ejection mechanism during the great eruption were directly linked to the central star s rotation .",
    "frank et al . (",
    "1995 ) have previously developed numerical two - dimensional gasdynamical models for the origin and evolution of the @xmath0 car homunculus . adopting the interacting wind scenario , wherein a high - velocity isotropic stellar wind interacts with a nonspherical environment",
    ", they found that models with a strong density enhancement toward to equator ( equator - to - pole density contrast @xmath1200 ) reproduce the observed morphology and kinematics of the homunculus . on the other hand , adopting the bjorkman @xmath3 casinelli ( 1992 ) model described above , langer et al .",
    "( 1999 ) also computed two - dimensional hydrodynamic models of the interacting winds scenario including the effects of stellar rotation in order to explain the formation of the @xmath0 car homunculus . in these models , a thick torus at the equator",
    "is required in order to reproduce the shape of the homunculus nebula .",
    "recently , frank et al . (",
    "1998 ) studied the opposite scenario , in which a nonspherical fast wind expands into an isotropic slower wind .",
    "they show that such nonspherical winds are able to produce bubble morphologies .",
    "however , like the previous ones , this model fails to produce the equatorial ejecta .",
    "also , dwarkadas & balick ( 1998 ) have invoked the presence of a toroidal ring near the nuclear region to collimate the material expelled by the star in the great eruption of the 1840s . though their radiative models show a fragmentation of the ring that could help to explain the observed equatorial ejecta , they only produced small velocities fragments ( @xmath13 km s@xmath4 ) .",
    "in a recent letter ( gonzlez et al .",
    "2004 , hereafter paper i ) , assuming that the shaping of the @xmath0 car nebula is dominated by the primary star s winds , we have presented a hydrodynamical simulation involving the interaction of intrinsically nonspherical winds . adopting an appropriate combination of the parameters that control the degree of non - spherical symmetry of the winds , we have found that the impact between the major eruption and the lighter pre - outburst flow can result in the formation of the bipolar nebulae and high - velocity equatorial ejections which are observed around @xmath0 car . in order to obtain from numerical simulations the set of parameters that best match the observations of the @xmath0 car nebula , in the present paper we present a comparison between several possible scenarios of the colliding wind model in which we have considered different combinations of the non - spherical symmetry parameters of the interacting winds .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in @xmath142 , we describe the model . in @xmath143 , we present the numerical simulations with a discussion of the results .",
    "finally , we give our conclusions in @xmath144 .",
    "as in paper i , the generalized nonospherical interacting stellar winds scenario is adopted .",
    "we first assume that before the great eruption in 1840 , @xmath0 car deposited many solar masses into the interstellar medium , creating a toroidal environment ( the pre - outburst wind ) in which the density and the velocity are characterized by ( see frank et al .",
    "1995 , 1998 ) ,    @xmath15    @xmath16    respectively , where @xmath17 is the injection radius ( assumed to be of a few stellar radii ) , and    @xmath18 \\label{e3}\\ ] ]    which controls the variation of the flow parameters from the equator ( @xmath19 ) to the polar direction ( at @xmath20 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 is related to the equator - to - pole density contrast @xmath22= 1/(1-@xmath21 ) , and @xmath23 controls the shape of the wind .",
    "equations ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) imply the simple case of constant mass loss rate ( @xmath24 ) as a function of polar angle . the great eruption and most of the wind phases that follow this outburst",
    "are also assumed to be nonspherical with their initial shapes also modulated by equations ( 1)-(3 ) .    in order to perform numerical simulations of the @xmath0 car winds , the @xmath25 parameters of the model ( @xmath21 and @xmath23 )",
    "must be specified for the different wind phases .",
    "it is possible to estimate these constants simply matching the models to the observed morphology of the homunculus structure around @xmath0 car . assuming spherical symmetry for the great eruption , frank et al .",
    "( 1995 ) found that models with @xmath26 0.99 and @xmath27 for the pre - outburst wind produce morphologies that best match the observations .",
    "another possibility for fixing the non - spherical parameters @xmath21 and @xmath23 is to use the kinematical properties of the homunculus .",
    "smith ( 2002 ) measured the expansion velocity ( in h@xmath28 ) of the polar lobes and calculated the physical size of the nebula at different latitudes , adopting a distance of 2250 pc and an age of 158 yr . in figure 1 , we have fitted smith s observations with eq . ( 2 ) and obtained much smaller values for the parameters above ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) . in the present analysis , we have examined different combinations of this pair of parameters for the interacting winds along the evolution history of @xmath0-car outflow ( see below ) .",
    "considering the high degree of axial symmetry of the @xmath0-car nebulae , we have carried out two - dimensional ( instead of three - dimensional ) gasdynamic numerical simulations of the @xmath0 car wind using the adaptative grid yguaz - a code . in this code",

    "the flux - vector splitting algorithm of van leer ( 1982 ) is employed .",
    "the simulations were computed on a four - level binary adaptative grid with a maximum resolution of @xmath31 cm , corresponding to @xmath32 grid points extending over a computational domain of @xmath33 cm .    for the different elements that have been used for the simulations , we have used the abundances ( h , he , c , o ) = ( 0.9 , 0.099 .",

    "we observe the formation of a bipolar nebula embedded within the homunculus .",
    "the existence of such a structure was deduced from the observations of ishibashi et al .",
    "the spherical symmetry assumed for this minor eruptive wind in run f ( fig .",
    "7 ) produces a little homunculus expanding in the polar direction with velocity @xmath111 km s@xmath4 at the equator , the interaction of the shock fronts of the inner and outer homunculus starts at 110 yr after the minor eruption and we find that there is almost no contribution to the outer equatorial ejecta from the material expelled in the minor eruption , its material is mainly inside the walls of the bubble of the outer homunculus .",
    "therefore , in our simulations the outer , high speed equatorial ejecta are produced only by the interaction of the great eruption ( of the 1840s ) with the pre - outburst wind .    in run g ( fig .",
    "8) , motivated by recent uv images within 0.2 arcsec of the star ( that have revealed the existence of a little internal torus which could be related to the little homunculus and could signify that a recurrent mass ejection with the same geometry as that of the great eruption might have occurred ; smith et al .",
    "2003c ) , we have assumed the same non - spherical symmetry parameters for the minor eruption as those of the great eruption wind ( see table 1 ) . in this case , the resulting inner homunculus nebula follows the shape of the outer one , but it also fails to produce equatorial ejections and the shock fronts of the two homunculi do not even interact during their lifetime .    in the polar direction ,",
    "both numerical simulations show a thickness of @xmath1 10@xmath112 cm for the expanding shell of the inner homunculus .    in figure 9",
    ", we present the logarithmic - scale density maps in four quadrants of model f for four different times ( t = 10 , 60 , 110 and 160 yr ) of evolution since the great eruption ( taken from paper i ) .",
    "we observe more clearly from these simulations of the evolution ( of the five interacting winds ) the formation of the bipolar nebulae with shapes similar to the large and little homunculi of @xmath0 car .",
    "the impact of the large homunculus with the shock front of the pre - outburst wind ( which occurs @xmath1 100 yr after the great eruption ) causes the formation of the low density equatorial ejection mentioned above ( see the bottom - right panel of fig .",
    "9 , and also fig . 2 of paper i ) .",
    "adopting the interacting stellar wind scenario , we have carried out numerical simulations of the formation and evolution of the @xmath0 car bipolar outflows .",
    "different possible scenarios have been investigated , which consider several combinations of the parameters that control the degree of non - spherical symmetry of the colliding winds .",
    "our models show important differences in the shape and kinematics of the homunculus and the little homunculus , but suggest that the formation of the bipolar nebulae and the high - velocity features observed in this source can result from the impact of intrinsically nonspherical winds coming from the central star .    in a first attempt ,",
    "we have tried to simulate , as in previous work ( frank et al .",
    "1995 ; langer et al . 1999 ; dwarkadas @xmath3 balick 1998 , the @xmath0 car nebulae assuming a fast , spherical eruptive wind impinging on a dense , slow toroidal pre - outburst wind . for the later",
    ", we have assumed nonspherical density and velocity distributions estimated from the observations of smith ( 2002 ) of the expansion velocity of the homunculus structure at different latitudes .",
    "given the small equator - to - pole density contrast ( @xmath14.5 ) of the pre - outburst wind in this case , the numerical experiment has shown that the fast flow of the great eruption quickly sweeps the toroidal pre - outburst almost eliminating the ( non - spherical ) bipolar shape ( fig . 1 ,",
    "run a ) .",
    "we then considered the interaction of intrinsically nonspherical winds . adopting the same angular distribution ( in density and velocity ) for the great eruption and the pre - outburst wind estimated from the observations of smith ( 2002 ) ,",
    "our numerical simulations have shown that a bipolar shell with the shape and kinematics of the observed homunculus nebula around @xmath0 car naturally develops ( fig .",
    "3 , run b ) .",
    "however , this model is not able to produce ( at least not within a @xmath1160 yr period of evolution since the major eruption ) high - velocity features near the equatorial plane , as those observed in the hst images of this source ( e.g. morse et al .",
    "1998 , smith et al .",
    "2003a ) .",
    "in order to obtain the formation of both the outer homunculus structure and the equatorial ejecta , we have simulated the interaction of nonspherical winds ( the great eruption and the pre - outburst wind ) with different degrees of non - spherical symmetry .",
    "we have found an appropriate combination of the non - spherical symmetry parameters that best match the observations of @xmath0 car ( see figs . 4 and 9 ) .",
    "the numerical simulations of this model ( run c ) show the formation of a tenuous and narrow , high - velocity equatorial ejection ( with a maximum expansion velocity of @xmath1700 km s@xmath4 ) arising from the impact of the homunculus with the shock front of the pre - eruptive torus at the equator .",
    "this equatorial ejection could correspond to the high velocity components of the equatorial skirt observed in the @xmath0 car nebula ( also , see paper i ) .    based on data from the current @xmath0 car wind observed within scales of @xmath1100 au ( smith et al .",
    "2003a ) , we have also carried out numerical simulations assuming similar conditions for the past winds , i.e. , a larger density , velocity and mass loss rate in the polar direction than in the equator for the pre - outburst wind that preceded the great eruption . in this model ( run d ) , a structure that resembles the homunculus is indeed formed , but the very faint equatorial features suggest that the conditions of the @xmath0 car wind before the great eruption were probably not the same as the current ones .    additionally , we have also investigated a possible scenario ( run e ) with a higher velocity pre - outburst wind , as suggested from the observations of currie et al .",
    "we found that a bipolar nebula with morphology and kinematics similar to the @xmath0 car homunculus is formed , but the numerical simulations obtained from this model show a very rarefied equatorial ejection ( fig .",
    "this result indicates that the high - velocity shell observed by currie et al .",
    "( 2002 ) does not necessarily imply a relatively high - velocity pre - outburst wind just before the great eruption .",
    "the high - velocity features observed at high latitudes outside the homunculus nebulae of @xmath0-car , and the observed outer ejecta in general ( weis et al .",
    "2001 , weis 2004 ) , could perhaps be the relics of a previous eruptive event ( possibly with similar strength to the great eruption ) .",
    "the presence of eruptions and sudden variability in the light curve of @xmath0-car every 50 years since the great eruption ( humphreys 2004 ) is an indication that similar events could have occurred also in the past , before the great eruption ( de gouveia dal pino et al .",
    "2004 ) .    the numerical experiments ( figs . 7 and 8) including the second eruptive event ( which we have called the minor eruption ) of @xmath0 car fifty years after the great eruption show the formation of an internal bubble with a bipolar shape very similar to the one implied by the observations of the little homunculus of ishibashi et al .",
    "in particular , run g ( fig .",
    "7 ) in which the minor eruption has been simulated with the same geometry as the great one , produces a little homunculus with the same shape as the outer homunculus .",
    "however , little can be said in favor of one model over the other one ( runs f and g ) as detailed observations of the geometry and kinematics of the little homunculus are still required .    in spite of recent spectroscopic observations that provide evidence of equatorial gas with low and high velocities , probably associated with both the 1840s and the 1890s eruptions ( e.g. davidson et al .",
    "2001 ) , in our simulations there is almost no contribution of the minor eruption to the high speed equatorial ejecta .",
    "this suggests that some extra physical ingredient may be missing in our numerical model .",
    "a potential mechanism could be rotation .",
    "if rotation was present , the associated centrifugal forces could help to push part of the inner eruptive wind outwards through the walls of the homunculus nebulae in the equatorial region thus producing a slow ejection component in that direction .",
    "finally , we mention the new work of matt & balick ( 2004 ) , who have modelled the homunculus in terms of a steady , mhd wind from a rotating source with a dipole magnetic field ( which is aligned with the rotation axis ) . in the future , models incorporating both the time - dependence of the successive eruptions ( as in our present paper ) and the effects of the stellar rotation and magnetic field ( as in the work of matt & balick 2004 ) should be studied .",
    "another new observational result is that the mass of the homunculus could be much larger ( smith et al .",
    "models incorporating this result should also be attempted in the future .",
