    "the u.s . housing market experienced a continuous rise since the 1990 s , which was driven by diverse factors such as the wealth effect and the inflow of international capitals @xcite .",
    "according to the log - periodic power - law model @xcite , no bubble was detected in the us housing market in 2003 @xcite .",
    "however , in 2005 , evident signatures of a housing bubble were identified @xcite , and a strikingly accurate forecast was released in the abstract of ref .",
    "@xcite stating that : `` from the analysis of the s&p 500 home index , we conclude that the turning point of the bubble will probably occur around mid-2006 . ''",
    "the turndown of the us house prices measured by the s&p case - shiller house price index was indeed fulfilled in 2006 , which triggered the outbreak of the us subprime mortgage crisis in 2007 .",
    "the aftermath was very severe .",
    "it caused the credit crisis in the us and a national crisis in us s financial markets .",
    "the us financial crisis diffused to the worldwide financial markets and hastened a global financial crisis in 2008 . in this case , stock markets acted perfectly as the barometer of real economies and a global economic recession followed unavoidably .",
    "what followed further was the european sovereign debt crisis .",
    "the worldwide economies are still struggling on the way to recover .",
    "the outline of this story demonstrates the crucial role played by an economy s housing market .    in the past three decades ,",
    "china s economy experienced an unprecedented growth with an average growth rate of about 10% and the capitalization of the chinese stock market has become one of the largest all over the world . during the global financial tsunami ,",
    "the chinese stock market bubble bust and dropped by about 80% with the shanghai stock exchange composite index plummeted from its historical high at 6124 on 16 october 2007 to 1664 on 28 october 2008 @xcite , and china s economy has also slowed down by about 2%-3% when measured in gdp .",
    "nevertheless , the housing markets in diverse chinese cities seemed to continue the almost nonstop mania for more than ten years . in late 2003 , the shanghai house price composite index has exhibited signatures of an undoubtable bubble in store @xcite . in early 2008 ,",
    "the shanghai housing market dropped mildly and then continued to soar , which was partially fuelled by the government bailout of 40 trillion chinese yuan in november 2008 .",
    "there are still debates on whether there is a housing bubble in china",
    ". however , the consensus is apt to the presence of a bubble and many people think or hope that the bubble will crash sooner or later , although there are also many people deny the possibility of bubble burst , including some officials and house builders . nevertheless , the possibility that the housing market will crash nationwide is a sword hanged on the development of china s economy .",
    "a crash of the housing market will cause severe damages to the economy and even cause social problems .",
    "it has been well recognized that studying complex economic and financial systems under the framework of complex networks has crucial scientific significance , because the units or agents in complex systems interact with each other in a nonlinear manner @xcite . in this work",
    ", we will investigate the correlation structure of house price indexes of 10 key cities in china based on both linear and nonlinear econophysical and econometric methods , which is closely related to the systemic risk of the national housing market @xcite .",
    "we identify city clubs and club convergence in the house price indexes and high systemic risk in the national housing market .",
    "we use the monthly house price composite index ( hpi ) data for 10 key cities of china covering the period from january 2005 to november 2013 , which were retrieved from the china real estate index system ( creis ) of the china index academy .",
    "the data are publicly available at http://fdc.fang.com/index/xinfangindex.aspx .",
    "the 10 key cities include beijing ( bj ) , shanghai ( sh ) , guangzhou ( gz ) , shenzhen ( sz ) , tianjin ( tj ) , wuhan ( wh ) , chongqing ( cq ) , nanjing ( nj ) , hangzhou ( hz ) , chengdu ( cd ) .",
    "the house price indexes are constructed as the urban comprehensive index which takes houses of residence , office edifice and commercial shop into account .",
    "the hpis of these key cities are regarded as the vane of china s real estate market .",
    "figure [ fig : rawdata ] illustrates the hpi time series @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) of city @xmath2 . because the data of the first 6 months are unavailable for wuhan , hangzhou and chengdu , we investigate the hpis since july 2005 , containing 101 data points for each city .",
    "the random matrix theory ( rmt ) has been long applied in the econophysics community @xcite .",
    "the similarity between two time series @xmath0 and @xmath3 is commonly calculated by the pearson correlation coefficient as follows :    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the calculation of mean and @xmath6 is the standard deviation of time series @xmath0 .",
    "we study the raw correlation matrix @xmath7 , whose elements @xmath8 are the pearson correlation coefficients between various pairs of time series @xmath9 and @xmath10 .    the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath7",
    "provide important information . in terms of the principal component analysis , for @xmath11 time",
    "series , the eigenvectors @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) of the correlation matrix @xmath7 are a full set of orthogonal axis in space which could decompose the total variability of all the time series into several orthogonal sub - variabilities by projecting observations on the axis .",
    "this set of decompositions suggests that the variability summarized by the first ( largest ) eigenvalue @xmath14 and its corresponding eigenvector @xmath15 is the maximum among all possible orthogonal choice of the axis , the second largest eigenvalue @xmath16 and its corresponding eigenvector @xmath17 then summarize the maximum variation in the unexplained portion of the original series after excluding the information explained by @xmath14 , and so on up to the smallest eigenvalue @xmath18 .",
    "the percent of variability explained by projecting observations on each eigenvector @xmath12 can be calculated as follows : @xmath19 we could also calculate the cumulative percent up to the @xmath2th eigenvalue as follow : @xmath20 which is also called the absorption ratio @xcite and is a measure of systemic risk @xcite",
    ".    applications of the random matrix theory ( rmt ) to stock market @xcite and housing market @xcite show that , the largest eigenvalue @xmath14 and its corresponding eigenvector @xmath15 characterized the collective response of the entire market to a common stimuli .",
    "if there is a strong collective behavior in the market , all components would participate almost identically in the @xmath15 , representing an influence that is common to all stocks .",
    "@xmath14 and its corresponding @xmath21 would be extremely large , interpreting most of the variability in the observations .",
    "one could further unravel some grouping information from other largest eigenvalues and their associated eigenvectors which deviate from the rmt predictions .",
    "besides , the smallest eigenvalue @xmath18 and its corresponding eigenvector @xmath22 could highlight pairs of stocks with a correlation coefficient much larger than the average , namely `` decoupling '' from other stocks @xcite .      the box clustering method has been applied to search for element clusters of the correlation matrix @xcite .",
    "it first determines the optimal ordering of matrix elements to ensure that the correlation matrix has a nested block - diagonal structure , where the simulated annealing approach is adopted to minimize the cost function : @xmath23 where @xmath8 could be the element of raw or partial correlation matrix in this work .",
    "then a greedy algorithm is implemented to partition time series into clusters .",
    "the procedures should be repeated @xmath24 times and obtain @xmath24 different partitions of hpi clusters @xcite .",
    "an affinity matrix @xmath25 is obtained , whose element @xmath26 is the number of partitions in which series @xmath0 and @xmath3 are assigned to the same cluster , divided by the number of partitions @xmath24 .",
    "we take a typical number of @xmath27 here .",
    "finally we apply the clustering method to the affinity matrix @xmath25 itself , resulting in a final partition of the time series .",
    "the concept of partial correlation is a powerful tool to investigate the intrinsic correlation between two time series effected by common factors @xcite and has been applied in stock markets @xcite and housing markets @xcite . for time",
    "series @xmath0 , @xmath28 with a common collective trend @xmath29 , we can extract their idiosyncratic components @xmath30 by calibrating the following simple univariate factor model : @xmath31 when there are more than one common factors , the above regression can be easily extended to the multivariate form .",
    "the correlation matrix of @xmath30 is the partial correlation matrix @xmath32 of the original time series , whose elements @xmath33 depict the residual correlations between @xmath0 and @xmath3 after removing the impact of the market - wide collective effect @xmath29 which is the eigenportfolio of the largest eigenvalue .      with the complete set of eigenvalues eigenvalues and eigenvectors , the correlation matrix @xmath7 can be expressed as follows : @xmath34 then , we can decompose the correlation matrix into three parts as @xcite @xmath35 where the first component @xmath36 represents a market mode reflecting collective behavior driven by a common influencing force , the second component @xmath37 stands for the correlation structure with the bulk eigenvalues reflecting the partitioning of time series , and the third component @xmath38 is the random noise terms .",
    "the determine of the market mode @xmath36 is trivial .",
    "the determine of @xmath39 for @xmath37 is not straightforward .",
    "one can use the eigenvalues that deviating the prediction of the rmt @xcite or estimate through econometric method @xcite . because we have only 10 time series",
    ", we do not distinguish @xmath37 and @xmath38 and adopt the following simple decomposition : @xmath40 where @xmath41 note that , when @xmath11 is large , it is necessary to further extract the noise part @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath42 test proposed by phillips and sul is based on a nonlinear time varying factor model and provides a framework for modeling the transitional dynamics as well as long - run behaviors @xcite . for the time series @xmath0",
    ", we can represent it with a time varying common factor : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a single common component and @xmath45 is a time varying idiosyncratic element which captures the deviation of @xmath2 from the common path defined by @xmath44 . following the previous work @xcite , we eliminate the cyclical components by applying the hp filter @xcite and extract the trend components @xmath46 of @xmath0 as the analyzing series . within this framework ,",
    "all @xmath11 time series will converge , at some point in the future , to the steady state if @xmath47 for all @xmath28 , irrespective of whether the series are near the steady state or in transition .",
    "it is important given that the paths to the steady state across the time series can be significantly different . since @xmath45 can not be directly estimated from eq .",
    "( [ eq : yit decomposition ] ) , phillips and sul eliminate the common component @xmath44 through rescaling by the panel average @xcite : @xmath48 the relative transition measurement @xmath49 captures the transition path with respect to the panel average , which is analogical with the differential @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : deviation from benchmark ] ) . in order to define a formal econometric test of convergence as well as an empirical algorithm of defining club convergence , the following semi - parametric form for the time varying coefficients @xmath45",
    "is assumed : @xmath51 where @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is weakly dependent upon @xmath54 but is @xmath55 over @xmath2 .",
    "the function @xmath56 is a slow varying function , increasing and divergent at infinity ( @xmath57 in the present report ) . under this specific form for @xmath45 , the null hypothesis @xmath58 of convergence for all @xmath2 and the alternative hypothesis @xmath59 of non - convergence for some @xmath2",
    "are expressed as follows : @xmath60 phillips and sul demonstrate that the null of convergence can be tested in the framework of the following regression @xcite : @xmath61 for @xmath62 , [ rt]+1,\\ldots , t$ ] , where @xmath63 ( we use @xmath64 in the present work as recommended in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath65 is the length of initial time series , and @xmath66 $ ] represents the integer part of @xmath67 . in this regression , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is relative transition path in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_it ] ) and @xmath71 is the least squares estimate of @xmath72 .",
    "the null hypothesis of convergence can be tested by applying a conventional one - side t - test for the slope coefficient @xmath73 .",
    "for example , if the point estimate @xmath74 is significantly less than zero , the null hypothesis of convergence is rejected .",
    "specifically , at the @xmath75 significance level , the null hypothesis of convergence is rejected if the t statistic of @xmath74 is less than -1.65 , that is , @xmath76 .",
    "however , the rejection of full convergence does not imply the absence of convergence in subgroups of the panel .",
    "phillips and sul propose the following clustering algorithm to find a core convergence subgroup @xcite :    1 .",
    "order the cities in the panel according to the last observation 2 .",
    "find core cities in the panel by running the @xmath42 regression for the @xmath77 highest cities with @xmath78 , and calculate the convergence @xmath54statistic @xmath79 .",
    "the core cities size is chosen on the basis of the maximum @xmath79 with @xmath80 .",
    "3 .   add one city at a time to the @xmath77 core member ( step 2 ) and perform the @xmath42 test . if the resulting @xmath79 is greater than zero , a first convergence club is constituted .",
    "4 .   run a @xmath42 regression for the remaining cities in the panel and check if the convergence criterion is met . if this group satisfies the convergence test",
    ", then these members form a second convergence club .",
    "otherwise , repeat step 1 to 3 to see if the remaining set can be further subdivided into convergence clusters .",
    "if no core group can be formed in , then these cities exhibit a divergent behavior .",
    "the correlation matrix @xmath81 , whose element @xmath8 is the pearson correlation coefficient between the hpi series @xmath0 of cities @xmath2 and @xmath82 has been studied . in the meanwhile , we also investigate the correlation matrix @xmath83 of the trend component of @xmath0 series , where the trend component @xmath84 is obtained by eliminating the cyclical component from @xmath0 using hp filter @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : corrmat : affimat : raw ] illustrates the correlation matrices of @xmath81 and @xmath83 along with their corresponding affinity matrices @xmath85 and @xmath86 obtained by the box clustering method @xcite .",
    "although box clustering method provides some block clusters in the affinity matrix , the extremely high correlation coefficients in the correlation matrix make the cluster results far - fetched .",
    "nevertheless , we can still observe two clusters of cities in fig .",
    "[ fig : corrmat : affimat : raw]*b * , in which beijing , guangzhou , shenzhen and shanghai are widely recognized as the first - tier cities in the chinese housing market .",

    "observing @xmath14 and @xmath15 in table [ tb : corrmat : eigen : values : vectors ] , we can find that @xmath15 contains practically identical components with the same signs ( positive here ) and the contribution percent of @xmath14 has reached an extremely high level with @xmath87 . according to the random matrix theory @xcite , we conclude that there is a strong collective force driving these hpi series rising .",
    "the largest eigenvalue @xmath14 and its eigenvector @xmath15 could adequately quantify the qualitative notion of the collective response of the entire system to stimuli .",

    "in summary , we aimed at quantifying the behaviors of hpi series of 10 key cities of china , based on both linear and non - linear approaches .",
    "an extremely strong collective trend has been detected , driving all the hpi series rising .",
    "simultaneously , according to the investigation of partial correlation and residual information matrix , it also shows that correlations between series basically come from this collective trend .",
    "the relative behaviors of hpi series to their collective trend are also studied .",
    "deviation paths , which is quantified by the differentials between hpi series and their collective trend , are grouped into two clubs , with club@xmath93 consisting of shenzhen , guangzhou and beijing and club@xmath94 consisting of shanghai , chengdu , nanjing , tianjin , wuhan , hangzhou and chongqing .",
    "members between the two clubs are anti - correlated , corresponding to the deviation paths going towards opposite directions .",
    "it suggests that the rising of the chinese hpi is driven by a minority of cities like those in club@xmath93 .",
    "some heterogeneities for the two clubs can be observed by investigating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the correlation matrix .    a recent panel convergence test ,",
    "namely @xmath42 test , has been applied to examine the convergence of the hpi series .",
    "it reveals that 10 cities hpi series do not form a homogeneous convergence club . instead , our results identify four city clubs that converge to different steady states . in subsequent studies",
