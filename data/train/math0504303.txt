    "the distribution of rational points on an algebraic variety @xmath1 is very subtle .",
    "for example , it can often happen that there is a proper subvariety @xmath2 of @xmath1 such that the set of rational points of @xmath2 has density one in the set of rational points of @xmath1 , where density is used in the sense of weil heights .",
    "roughly speaking , such subvarieties @xmath2 are called accumulating subvarieties .",
    "thus , if one is interested in the arithmetic of @xmath1 , one must first identify which rational points of @xmath1 lie on @xmath2 , and which do not .",
    "unfortunately , even the purely geometric problem of identifying potential accumulating subvarieties @xmath2 can be very difficult .",
    "it would be helpful to have a local and arithmetic criterion to identify points @xmath0 which lie on accumulating subvarieties . in this paper",
    ", we do not quite manage to construct such a criterion , but we do identify an invariant , called the approximation constant of @xmath0 on @xmath1 with respect to a divisor @xmath3 , which describes how well @xmath0 can be approximated by other rational points of @xmath1 .",
    "( see definition  [ bigdef ] for details . )",
    "if @xmath0 lies on an accumulating subvariety , then it can be well approximated by other rational points , and therefore will have a small approximation constant .",
    "in the course of computing this constant in many examples , it became clear that sequences which best approximate a rational point @xmath0 tend to lie along curves . while there are counterexamples to show that this principle can not hold in general , we are able to formulate a conjecture which predicts that it should be true whenever @xmath0 lies on a rational curve defined over the field of coefficients ( see conjecture  [ ratcurve ] ) .",
    "we prove this conjecture for a wide range of examples .",
    "the basic technique we use for proving conjecture  [ ratcurve ] is inductive .",
    "we start by proving the conjecture for @xmath4 ( see theorem  [ ratapprox ] ) .",
    "we then prove a number of inductive results which enable us to take advantage of the structure of the nron - severi group of @xmath1 . using these inductive results , we prove conjecture  [ ratcurve ] for a wide range of rational surfaces by means of a careful analysis of the nef cone .    in the final section ,",
    "we make several remarks about further directions in which to attack conjecture  [ ratcurve ] , and drawbacks of our current techniques .",
    "we describe some cases which are unlikely to be proven using our current techniques , and we further deduce conjecture  [ ratcurve ] from vojta s main conjecture ( conjecture 3.4.3 of @xcite ) for a generic variety of non - negative kodaira dimension .",
