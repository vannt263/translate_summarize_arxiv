    "for the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) ising antiferromagnet on the square lattice in a uniform magnetic field , the low temperature ordered phase is separated from the paramagnetic phase by a simple , 2nd order phase boundary .",
    "( within the context of the lattice gas model this system could be described as having repulsive nn - coupling and forming a @xmath2 ordered state . ) with the addition of repulsive ( antiferromagnetic ) next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) interactions the situation becomes more complicated .",
    "early monte carlo simulations suggested that a single , super - antiferromagnetic , or @xmath3 , phase existed , separated from the paramagnetic phase by a single phase boundary@xcite .",
    "a degenerate , row - shifted @xmath4 state was also predicted at zero temperature .",

    "the original motivation of this study was to investigate the possibility of xy - like behavior of the ising spins on the square lattice , since there is numerical evidence@xcite that ising antiferromaget with attractive nnn interaction on the triangular lattice has an xy - like intermediate state between the low temperature ordered state and high temperature disordered state .",
    "in fact , the present model has already been studied by many authors using different approaches .",
    "an early monte carlo study@xcite comprehensively showed the phase diagrams for several different interaction ratios ( r ) of nnn to nn interaction .",
    "but due to the deficiencies of computer resources at that time , for the @xmath5 case , a disordered region was missed between the two ordered phases which was pointed out in a later interfacial free energy study@xcite",
    ". meanwhile , transfer matrix studies@xcite found reentrant behavior for the @xmath0 transition lines . while a study using the cluster variation method@xcite concluded that for a range of r ( 0.5@xmath61.2 ) the system undergoes a first order transition , a recent monte carlo study@xcite using a variant of the wang - landau method@xcite focused on the @xmath5 case without external field and found the phase transition is of second order .",
    "for external field @xmath7 ( in the unit of nn interaction constant ) the two ordered phases , namely @xmath0 and row - shifted @xmath1 , are degenerate at zero temperature so it is tempting to think that the cubic anisotropy would be zero for this field and that there could be a kosterlitz - thouless transition .    in this paper , we carefully study the location of phase boundaries and the critical behavior for the case @xmath5 . in sec .",
    "[ s1 ] the model and relevant methods and analysis techniques are reviewed .",
    "our results are presented in sec .  [ s2 ] , along with finite size scaling analyses , and we summarize and conclude in sec.[s3 ] .",
    "the ising model with nnn interaction is described by the hamiltonian @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are nn and nnn interaction constants , respectively , h is an external magnetic field , and the sums in the first two terms run over indicated pairs of neighbors on a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",

    "see fig .",
    "locally , the structure may appear to be @xmath1 , but for large enough lattices the equilibrium structure always shows row shifting . as a result ,",
    "such a row - shifted @xmath1 state is highly degenerate , and the antiferromagnetic sublattice exhibits only one dimensional long range order . in terms of the sublattice magnetizations @xmath13 we can define two components of the order parameter for the @xmath0 state @xmath14/4,\\ ] ] @xmath15/4,\\ ] ] with a computationally convenient root - mean - square order parameter @xmath16 since @xmath17 would have a limiting value of @xmath18 for the row - shifted @xmath1 state and be zero for the disordered state , it can also be used as an order parameter for the row - shifted @xmath1 state .",

    "the true ordering susceptibility @xmath23 , which is @xmath24 , is used to eliminate simulation errors resulting from @xmath25 , where the order parameter is known to be zero for the infinite lattice .      for small lattice sizes ,",
    "wang - landau sampling  @xcite was used to obtain a quick overview of the thermodynamic behavior of our model . a two - dimensional random walk in energy and magnetization space",
    "was performed so that the density of states @xmath26 could be used to determine all thermodynamic quantities ( derived from the partition function ) for any value of temperatures and external field . consequently , `` freezing '' problems are avoided at extremely low temperatures . this allowed us to determine the `` interesting '' regions of field - temperature space ; however , it quickly became apparent that , because of subtle finite size effects , quite large lattices would be needed .",
    "unfortunately , as l increases , the number of entries of histogram explodes as @xmath27 and it proved to be more efficient to use parallel tempering instead .",
    "since a large portion of interesting phase boundary is at relatively low temperatures and many local energy minima exist which makes the relaxation time rather long , the parallel tempering method@xcite is a good choice for simulating our model .",
    "the basic idea is to expand the low temperature phase space by introducing configurations from the high temperatures .",
    "so , many replicas at different temperatures are simulated simultaneously , and after every fixed number of monte carlo steps , a swap trial is performed with a metropolis - like probability which satisfies the detailed balance condition . the transition probability from a configuration @xmath28 simulated at temperature @xmath29 to a configuration @xmath30 simulated at temperature",

    "one can also estimate the exponent @xmath53 from the relation of the peak position with lattice size for the specific heat @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the `` background '' contribution . in some cases",
    "when the appropriate paths , i.e. which are perpendicular to the phase boundary , are ones of constant temperatures , then the critical behavior would be expressed in terms of reduced field @xmath56 , and all the above analysis still applies .",
    "general purpose computing on graphics processing units(gpu ) attracts steadily increasing interest in simulational physics@xcite , since the computational power of recent gpu exceeds that of a central processing unit(cpu ) by orders of magnitude . the advantage continues to grow as the performance of gpu s doubles every year .",
    "recently , a gpu accelerated monte carlo simulation of ising models@xcite was performed . compared to traditional cpu calculations , the speedup was about 60 times .",

    "initially , all the replica are loaded to the global memory of the gpu . for each replica ,",
    "the entire lattice is divided into four sublattices , then spins in the same sublattice can be updated simultaneously by the gpu using a metropolis scheme , and the swap of configurations of replica pairs can also be achieved in parallel .    on the geforce gtx285 graphics unit ,",
