    "relevance of intermittency and multifractal scalings in plasma fluctuations and turbulence have been pointed out in various recent studies .",
    "data analysis based on recent satellite and spaceship measurements reveals that space plasma fluctuations are mostly intermittent in nature with multifractal characteristics @xcite . in a fusion plasma edge fluctuations in stellarators and tokamaks",
    "show that the plasma turbulence is more of an intermittent nature in short time and space scales than in moderate scales when turbulence seems to have a monofractal feature @xcite .",
    "intermittency and multifractal fluctuations are also observed in the dynamics of discharge plasma @xcite .",
    "significance of multifractal scalings and intermittency were studied in several works in the fluid turbulence mandel , parisi , benzi .",
    "the key feature of the multifractal scaling is the nontrivial dependence of the scaling exponent @xmath0 on a singularity parameter @xmath1 that quantifies the strength of singularity in the multifractal measure of the fluctuating dynamical quantity .",
    "the symbol @xmath2 , on the other hand , denotes the @xmath2th moment for the associated probability measure and relates to the singularity parameter @xmath1 by a legendre transform .",
    "when the exponent @xmath0 scales linearly with @xmath2 , the fluctuation is purely self - similar , characteristic of a monofractal behaviour . in a more general situation",
    ", @xmath0 denotes the generalized dimension spectrum , that is used to classify the observed spatio - temporal fluctuation distributions in various fluid and plasma turbulence and instabilities .",
    "such fluctuation patterns do not conform to self - similarity , but tend , in general , to an intermittent behaviour , i.e. locally analogous to a devil s staircase function @xcite .",
    "understanding the origin and dynamics of such intermittent , multifractal fluctuations in the context of fluid and plasma flows is obviously of considerable interest @xcite .    in this work we present some new analytic results opening up novel routes to fluid and plasma instabilities",
    "@xcite which are usually absent in a more conventional analysis of fluid or plasma models .",
    "our study is based on a novel scale invariant nonlinear analysis developed to address in a more coherent manner the production of complex multifractal structures dynamically from a simple initial state .",
    "theory of fractional kinetics @xcite using fractional calculus and fractional differential equations are considered by various authors @xcite to offer a general theoretical framework to model anomalous scalings and transports .",
    "the present approach is not only independent of the fractional kinetics but is a natural extension of the classical analysis to accommodate multifractal scaling behaviours in a smooth ( differentiable ) manner ( @xcite -@xcite ) .",
    "we show , in particular , how the linear differential measures of the form @xmath3 or @xmath4 in a laminar flow can be realized as smooth multifractal measures of the form @xmath5 and @xmath6 , for a range of multifractal exponents @xmath7 , in a turbulent flow .",
    "the singularity parameter @xmath1 corresponds to the _ scale _ exposing the level of singularity that is accessed asymptotically and can be related with the reynolds number in a turbulent flow .",
    "the derivation of such anomalous scalings rests on the assumption that increments in a complex flow could be mediated not only by linear shifts but also by small scale discrete , but _ smooth",
    "_ jumps , giving rise to a _",
    "duality principle _ and the associated proliferation of the underlying laminar flow differential equations into self similar replica equations over finer scales . in ordinary setting jump modes",
    "are discontinuous , asking for probabilistic arguments to extract macroscopic observables ( i.e. the moments ) from an irregular brownian type flow . in the present formalism jump",
    "mediated increments are shown to satisfy simple scale invariant linear differential equation in logarithmic variables as opposed to linear shifts of the form @xmath8 .",
    "although we focus here to applications of this formalism in plasma turbulence , other potential fields of applications are evolution of biological and living systems , stock market variations , dynamics of social systems such as growth and proliferation of human habitats , internet networking , to name a few .",
    "we note in particular that the dynamics of a complex organism is known to follow an evolutionary pattern driven mainly by discrete jump mode that is realized , however , in a smooth coherent manner @xcite avoiding direct collisions unlike the brownian motion .",
    "the crux of the present approach is to formulate discrete small scale jumps in a smooth manner formally which would allow one to avoid direct collisions with singular points those emerge copiously in the dynamics of a complex system .",
    "it is pertinent to state here the novelty and advantages of the present approach over those available in contemporary literature @xcite .",
    "as stated already , a major aim is to develop a nonlinear differential analysis to study _ local _ behaviour of emergent multifractal measures in turbulent media .",
    "the turbulent systems are traditionally studied by stochastic methods @xcite .",
    "mathematical models @xcite based on fractional calculus , on the other hand , are known to derive anomalous multifractal scaling laws of turbulent flows directly from the underlying fractional differential equations . however , there are various definitions of fractional derivatives such as riemann - liouville , caputo , weyl , riezs and others , having relative merits and demerits over each other over their scope and applicability @xcite",
    ". moreover , fractional derivatives are basically non - local , thus defeating the very motivation of using a differential equation to discuss local structures .",
    "the present approach , however , formulates a rigorous framework of using integer - order differential equations based instead on multifractal measures for local descriptions of evolutionary patterns of emergent complex systems .",
    "the differential equations valid for simple systems or in a laminar flow condition are shown to replicate self similarly on the emergent multifractal structures signaling onset of turbulence .    to explain emergence of anomalous multifractal scalings specifically in a turbulent plasma , we first discuss how the scaling of a dynamical variable may become anomalous due to novel multifractal contributions from the asymptotic boundary layer regions realized in a self consistent manner in a given fluid model .",
    "such anomalous scalings can be interpreted as the production in abundance of spatio - temporal multifractal measures @xcite triggering turbulence generating instabilities even in a simple electrostatic plane wave solution of the kinetic vlasov - maxwell system @xcite . as an another application of this novel nonclassical measure",
    ", we next derive anomalous stretched gaussian scalings @xcite for the transport of charged tracer particle distribution in a turbulent vlasov plasma .",
    "here , we present in brief the mathematical arguments @xcite leading to the emergence of multifractal scalings from standard differential measures in a laminar flow as the original laminar flow tends to become turbulent .",
    "recall that the traditional ( differential ) lebesgue measure is well suited for simple systems , for instance , the uniform rolling of a billiard ball along a straight line , say , or in a laminar flow .",
    "in such a context if one envisages a limiting statement involving @xmath9 ( @xmath10 may denote the position of the ball ) , then it is reasonably correct to treat this motion using the ordinary measure @xmath11 which goes to zero linearly with uniform rate 1 .",
    "motion of a single fluid particle in a moving or static body of fluid medium ( lagrangian view ) , however , is likely to present a new caveat . as the fluid particle moves uniformly along a streamline ( actually a path line ) of a laminar flow of the fluid medium , the standard _",
    "lebesgue measure _ apparently has to be modified because of a _",
    "possible back reaction _ generated by the intervening fluid particles in the medium . in a laminar flow such back reactions would of course be negligible and can safely be ignored .",
    "however , in a turbulent flow the said back reactions from intervening fluid particles ( molecules ) need not be negligible .",
    "the line segment joining any two points along a turbulent path line , @xmath10 and @xmath12 say , would develop more and more into an irregular curve as the particle at position @xmath10 is transported _ non - uniformly _ not only linearly but also through infinitesimal _ smooth _ jumps avoiding singularities those are created dynamically by the enhanced pressure generated within the flow .",
    "the length of the dynamically generated irregular curve in the intervening medium , which would grow indefinitely , would , however , contribute a finite ( renormalized ) correction term to the ordinary lebesgue measure akin to the renormalization group @xcite actions delivering a _ finite observable effect _ from an _ apparent divergence _",
    "( fig.1 ) .",
    "more importantly , _ this accumulation of an extra measure is realized in a manner consistent with the original dynamical constraints of the motion_.     in fluid model approaches 0 , the length of invisible ( inaccessible ) ) sector @xmath13 diverges intermittently as @xmath14 . in the limit @xmath15 ,",
    "the neighbourhood of 0 in the visible ( accessible ) sector @xmath16 is extended by a duality principle to a totally disconnected multifractal set and the original variable @xmath17 is replaced by the effective renormalized variable @xmath18 , where the multifractal scaling exponent @xmath19 corresponds to the singularity spectrum of the associated multifractal measure .",
    "the effective variable @xmath18 does not vanish even when @xmath17 goes to zero ( see text for details ) . _ _ ]      to explain the above mentioned emergence of the nonclassical measure , let us suppose that the dynamic variable @xmath17 , greater than 1 initially , approaches 0 from the right .",
    "for definiteness we assume that the variable @xmath17 is dimensionless in the sense that @xmath17 satisfies the scale invariant equation @xmath20the variable @xmath10 here may denote the position of a test particle in a uniformly flowing fluid .",
    "assume also that the real number line has a _ soft , fluid like structure _ ( one dimensional and may be static ) so that as @xmath16 approaches 0 the segment between 0 and @xmath17 gets _ squeezed _ in the form of an irregular curve .",
    "the length of this segment would grow indefinitely , supposedly in the form @xmath21 , as @xmath17 closes gradually toward 0 and continues to become vanishingly small , but does not vanish exactly ( 0 being a singular point , that may be present in a specific physical problem or fabricated dynamically , see below ) . as long as @xmath17 approaches 0 linearly as in an uniform laminar flow the factor @xmath22 would remain constant ( @xmath23 ) so that @xmath24 satisfies the scale invariant equation @xmath25 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 being a constant .",
    "however , as the line segment @xmath13 gets gradually squeezed due to effective compressive force generated by the nonlinear flow , we expect formation of a countable set of singular points where @xmath24 is nondifferentiable in the usual sense . the length ( measure ) of the dynamically generated irregular curve inside the interval @xmath13 would , however , grow gradually with the production of more and more singularities in the interior . in the present approach such a possibility of dynamic production of a singularity set",
    "is _ avoided _ , so to speak , by allowing the flow variable @xmath17 to execute smooth smaller scale jumps respecting eq([sfe2 ] ) and its dual eq([sfe3 ] ) .",
    "first , let us establish the successive growth of length of the interval @xmath13 with the generation of @xmath28 number of singular points @xmath29 such that @xmath30 . to begin with , suppose @xmath31 be the first singularity produced as the line segment @xmath13 is squeezed slightly .",
    "exploiting the scale invariance , the exponent @xmath24 would now satisfy eq([sfe2 ] ) with @xmath17 replaced by the rescaled variable @xmath32 so that we have @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and the length of the intervening fluid line would grow as @xmath35 . at the next level of squeezing ,",
    "one considers generation of two singular points @xmath36 . proceeding exactly as above with the rescaled variable @xmath37 instead ,",
    "one now arrives at an enhanced length of the form @xmath38 .",
    "notice that @xmath39 is inconsistent with the proposed scenario .",
    "thus with the production of more and more number of singular points the linear measure @xmath17 of the original segment @xmath13 would continue to grow multiplicatively as @xmath40 , @xmath41 as @xmath42 , when the @xmath28th level singularity @xmath43 is mapped to @xmath44 by rescaling @xmath45 .",
    "it follows , consequently , that the nature of the _ generic _ singularity at @xmath44 should alter successively as singularities from far deeper regions of @xmath13 are mapped to @xmath44 by rescalings . to conclude ,",
    "the diverging growth in measure in the interior of the fluid segment @xmath46 could be modeled by the simple , logarithmically scale invariant eq([sfe2 ] ) .",
    "the scaling exponent @xmath47 would diverge in an intermittent manner as new singularity at @xmath48 is met as @xmath15 by squeezing .",
    "this dynamical emergence of singularity set and the associated diverging growth in measure is , however , eliminated ( or avoided ) by invoking _",
    "the principle of duality and inversion mediated jump modes _ as outlined below .    to see explicitly this avoidance of singularity , suppose @xmath44 is the dynamically generated singularity as @xmath15 nonuniformly as described above . as noted already , singularity at any arbitrary point @xmath49",
    "can be mapped to @xmath44 by scale invariance , so that the description of jump mode in the neighbourhood of @xmath44 can be taken as generic . in the said neighbourhood of the singular point 1 ,",
    "let us consider two unevenly distributed points @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 for @xmath53 with the property that @xmath54 . by transition via _ inversion induced small scale jump _ we mean @xmath55 , so that the exponent @xmath56 .",
    "as a consequence eq([sfe2 ] ) valid in the right neighbourhood of 1 gets transformed into a _ dually ( inversely ) related self similar replica _",
    "@xmath57 leading to @xmath58 .",
    "notice that had the point @xmath44 been regular , eq([sfe2 ] ) would have been extended over the left neighbourhood as well .",
    "to emphasize , we see that the _ dual _",
    "eq([sfe3 ] ) is essentially _ the self similar replication of the original eq([sfe2 ] ) by inversion in classically forbidden ( that is to say , inaccessible ) region of the turbulent flow .",
    "_    in presence of this nontrivial jump mode , we now see that the effective scaling factor @xmath59 that remains _ locally constant _ in the right hand side of the singular point @xmath44 would make a smooth transition to a fluctuating variable @xmath60 by inversion induced jump . as @xmath61 ,",
    "the locally constant scale factor becomes a fluctuating variable @xmath62 for a class of scaling functions @xmath63 .",
    "the exponent @xmath64 depends on the nature of the singularity point .",
    "since there could at least be a countable set of singularities in the interval @xmath13 for any small but finite value of @xmath17 , @xmath65 actually denotes a multifractal scaling function . as a consequence , in the limit @xmath15 ,",
    "the ordinary laminar flow measure @xmath3 is transformed into the smooth multifractal measure @xmath66 where @xmath67 varies over the singularity set of @xmath13 .",
    "as , in the limit @xmath15 , there are an uncountable number of possible singularity set ( essentially , a family of cantor sets ) , exponent @xmath68 represents a huge spectrum of turbulent fluctuations .",

    "the neighbourhood of the generic singularity at @xmath44 is extended , by rescalings , into _ non - classical _ multifractal set that is covered by open intervals ( balls ) of size @xmath80 .",

    "we shall , however , continue to call the exponents @xmath69 and @xmath101 loosely as multifractal scaling exponents in what follows .",
    "we give here another derivation of the jump mediated multifractal increments to explain the origin of turbulent like behaviour in an asymptotic time as @xmath102 .",
    "this also points out the appearance of smaller and larger scales dynamically thus making room for activation of jump modes in an otherwise featureless flow .",

    "we rewrite this new rescaled inverted variable in the right neighbourhood of 0 by @xmath125 .",
