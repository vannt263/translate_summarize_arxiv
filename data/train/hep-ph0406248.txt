    "in recent years it has been suggested @xcite that solar neutrino flux measured by cl and ga radiochemical experiments and by super - kamiokande shows a time variability with characteristic periods resembling those of rotation of the solar magnetic fields . since this could be a very strong hint for sub - leading resonant - spin - flavour - precession ( rsfp ) of _ pp _ neutrinos occurring in the solar convection zone @xcite and for a non - negligible neutrino transition magnetic moment , it is of paramount importance to perform an extensive search for possible time modulations in the @xmath0ga data using different methods and exploiting the total information of the available solar runs .",
