    "the gluon propagator and flic overlap quark propagator are compared on quenched and dynamical flic lattices at @xmath107 and @xmath109 we observe the the presence of dynamical quarks causes suppression in the infrared in all quantities examined : the gluon dressing function @xmath110 the mass function @xmath8 and the quark renormalization function @xmath111 some differences between the results for the two lattice spacings indicate we are not quite in the scaling region at the coarser spacing .",
    "an alternative source of systematic error in the the quark propagator results is the simplistic fitting functions used , which do not take into account the possibility of non - analytic behaviour at light quark mass .",
