    "the problem of relaxation in nuclear magnetic resonance due to field gradients has been discussed by many authors but continues to be a topic of current research .",
    "recently attention has been focussed on this subject in connection with searches for new p , t violating forces mediated by the hitherto unobserved axion @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we give a short , very incomplete , summary of how the field developed until now . in 1950",
    "hahn @xcite used his just invented spin echo technique to study the effect of translational diffusion on relaxation in nmr .",
    "torrey , in 1953 @xcite gave a derivation of the effect of translational diffusion that had been alluded to by hahn . in 1954 carr and purcell @xcite presented a more elaborate method for measuring diffusion constants using relaxation due to translational diffusion in an inhomogeneous field with known gradient . then in 1956",
    "torrey @xcite introduced a specific partial differential equation ( torrey equation ) describing the effects of diffusion on relaxation .",
    "he showed that under conditions when diffusion theory was valid the physics was described by adding a diffusion term to the usual bloch equations .",
    "these treatments of diffusion did not take into account the effect of the boundaries of the measurement cell .",
    "ten years later ( 1966 ) baldwin robertson @xcite gave an approximate solution of the torrey equation in a relatively small region , defined by 2 parallel planes , where the influence of the boundaries was important . using the method of phase accumulation and assuming the phase distribution to be gaussian , neuman , in 1973 @xcite gave an approximate solution for planar , cylindrical and spherical geometries and showed this was in agreement with robertson s results .",
    "in 1987 , cates , schaefer and happer ( csh ) @xcite calculated the relaxation for parameters where the diffusion theory is appropriate using second order perturbation theory and an expansion in eigenfunctions of the torrey equation applied to the density matrix . at high densities",
    "the perturbation theory breaks down and at low densities ( @xmath0 the diffusion theory is invalid .",
    "( the present work shows how to go beyond this latter limit . )",
    "the authors start with the equation of motion for the density matrix in the presence of diffusion , ( torrey equation ) @xcite@xmath1 + d\\nabla^{2}\\rho\\label{a}\\ ] ] they consider the deviations of the magnetic field from the volume averaged field as a perturbation and the volume averaged field ( taken along @xmath2 ) as the unperturbed system .",
    "then , expanding @xmath3 in the eigenpolarizations of the unperturbed problem and carrying out a perturbation expansion in the field variation , taken to be varying linearly with position , they obtain a solution valid to second order in the perturbation .",
    "mcgregor @xcite has given a slightly more general treatment based on redfield s relaxation matrix theory @xcite , as presented by slichter @xcite .",
    "the starting point of this treatment is the equation of motion for the density matrix expanded to second order in a perturbation ( @xcite , equation 5.313 ) @xmath4   + \\left (   \\frac { i}{\\hbar}\\right )   ^{2}\\int_{0}^{t}\\left [   \\left [   \\rho^{\\ast}\\left ( 0\\right )   , h_{1}^{\\ast}\\left (   t^{\\prime}\\right )   \\right ]   , h_{1}^{\\ast } \\left (   t\\right )   \\right ]   dt^{\\prime}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 represents the deviation of the field from its volume averaged value and starred quantities are expressed in the interaction representation with the volume average field considered as the unperturbed system .",
    "the results show that the relaxation depends on the auto - correlation function of the fluctuating field ( frequency spectrum of the field fluctautions ) as seen by the spins as they move through the measurement cell and the correlation function is determined by the diffusion theory green s function for the case when diffusion theory is valid .    for high densities ,",
    "when the boundary conditions do not play a role , the exact solution obtained by torrey @xcite is valid .    following this work in 1991 , stoller , happer and dyson @xcite",
    "have shown how to use the exact eigenfunctions of the torrey equation ( airy functions ) to get exact solutions in one dimension .",
    "de swiet and sen @xcite have used this and other approaches to study a wider range of geometries .",
    "hayden et al ( 2004 ) give a nice discussion of the gaussian phase distribution work along with experimental confirmation in a cylindrical geometry @xcite .",
    "mcgregor @xcite has shown that the results of his redfield theory treatment are equivalent to those obtained from the torrey equation @xcite for the special case of the high pressure limit in a spherical cell .",
    "nevertheless it is illuminating to note that the expansion in the diffusion equation eigenfunctions obtained by csh @xcite is in fact the usual eigenfunction expansion of the green s function and hence the results based on the torrey equation @xcite and those of the redfield theory @xcite are identical for all cases considered by csh .",
    "we show this in the next section , with details confined to an appendix .",
    "thus the physical content of the two approaches are identical in spite of their rather different starting points .",
    "we then show how these results can be applied beyond the diffusion theory limits by giving an analytic expression for the trajectory correlation functions valid for a range of pressures wider than that for which diffusion theory is applicable .",
    "in the appendix we review the calculation of csh applied to spin 1/2 and using a slightly altered notation .",
    "we expand the density matrix in the spin 1/2 operators , @xmath6    the result for @xmath7 , equation ( [ 111a ] ) , compare equation ( 50 ) , csh:@xmath8   _ { -}\\left [   \\omega_{1}\\left ( \\overrightarrow{r}\\right )   \\right ]   _ { + } \\sum_{\\beta^{\\prime}}\\ \\left ( \\frac{\\phi_{\\beta^{\\prime}}\\left (   \\overrightarrow{r}^{\\prime}\\right ) \\phi_{\\beta^{\\prime}}\\left (   \\overrightarrow{r}\\right )   } { ( dk_{\\beta^{\\prime}}^{2}-i2\\omega_{o})}\\right )   d^{3}r^{\\prime}d^{3}r\\ ] ] is seen to contain the fourier transform of the eigenfunction expansion of the green function , equation ( [ 1a ] ) @xmath9 so that we have ( equation [ t1 ] , eqn.9 in @xcite)@xmath10 _ { x}\\left [   b_{1}\\left (   t+\\tau\\right )   \\right ]   _ { x}+\\left [   b_{1}\\left ( t\\right )   \\right ]   _ { y}\\left [   b_{1}\\left (   t+\\tau\\right )   \\right ] _ { y}\\right\\rangle\\ ] ]    similarly the results for @xmath11 ( [ xx ] ) are also equivalent to mcgregor s results ( eqn .",

    "having shown the equivalence of the csh treatment based on the torrey equation to the calculation based on redfield theory when diffusion theory is used in evaluating the correlation functions , we widen the range of applicability by introducing a form of the correlation function which is also valid when the diffusion theory breaks down , i.e. when the condition @xmath39 no longer holds ( @xmath40 is the collision mean free path and @xmath41 is a typical size of the containing vessel ) .      defining a correlation function as@xmath42 with @xmath43 representing an ensemble and time average , we have the following relations @xcite@xmath44 so the determination of any one will determine the whole family .",
    "barabanov _ et al _ @xcite _ _ have calculated the velocity auto - correlation function for particles moving in a closed vessel with specularly reflecting walls .",
    "the effect of gas collisions are taken into account .",
    "the method was initially @xcite applied to cylindrical vessels for a case where only the motion normal to the axis is relevant , and then to rectangular shaped vessels @xcite .",
    "the results have been checked by numerical simulations for many cases @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . the function @xmath45 obtained from @xmath46 by means of equation ( [ 011 ] ) , has been applied to the study of a false electric dipole moment effect that arises in magnetic resonance experiments in the presence of an electric field @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the result can easily be applied to spherical cavities , the only modification being that the distribution of the angle , @xmath47 , ( the angle between the trajectory and the normal to the reflecting surface ) will be different in the case of a sphere .",
    "the correlation function , initially obtained for a single velocity , can be averaged over the appropriate velocity distribution .    for simplicity we will concentrate on a rectangular vessel in this work . in that case",
    "the motions in each of the 3 directions are independent @xcite , so we concentrate on one dimension to begin . equations ( 27 , 36 and 37 ) of @xcite can be combined to give ( note the r.h.s . of ( 33 ) in that paper should be set equal to unity ) , @xmath48 \\label{011b}\\ ] ] where  the wall collision time , @xmath49 for particles with velocity @xmath50 ( in the plane of the trajectory ) , moving in a cylinder or sphere of radius @xmath51 . for the rectangular case",
