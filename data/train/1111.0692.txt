    "supermassive black holes ( smbh ) are now ubiquitously found in the nuclei of local galaxies .",
    "tight correlations have been observed between the central black hole and its host galaxy @xcite , implying that the growth of the quasar , powered by the smbh , is intimately linked to the formation of its host galaxy . at @xmath0 and above the most direct constraint on the evolution of smbhs",
    "comes from observations of luminous quasars in the sloan digital sky survey @xcite .",
    "recently a detection has been confirmed for a quasar at @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "these quasars are mainly optically selected and represent the bright end of the quasar population at this epoch .",
    "they are rare with number densities of @xmath7 a few gpc@xmath8 and extremely luminous with inferred masses of @xmath9 , suggesting that they are harboured in rare halos of mass @xmath10 at these redshifts .",
    "observations in other bands , far infrared ( fir)-radio , suggest that the spectral energy distributions ( sed ) of these quasars are similar to those of their low redshift counterparts @xcite .",
    "this means that @xmath11 black holes are _ fully developed _ and already in place even when the universe was relatively young ( @xmath12 years at @xmath13 ) .",
    "reprocessed thermal dust continuum emission in the fir provides a clean method for deriving the total star formation rates in galaxies @xcite .",
    "bright quasars also add to the fir luminosity , @xmath14 , and one needs to correct for it to estimate the star formation rate ( sfr ) of the host galaxy .",
    "the excess @xmath14 ( corrected ) for a sample of @xmath15 quasar hosts suggests a massive starburst origin ( sfr @xmath16 yr@xmath17 ) for them @xcite .",
    "these authors also detected large reservoirs of molecular gas , with mass @xmath18 , in these galaxies through the emission of redshifted carbon monoxide ( co ) line , further corroborating the result that the observed large star formation activity in these galaxies are sustained through an abundant supply of molecular gas , the fuel for star formation .",
    "the cold gas in these galaxies is localised within a radius of a few kpc @xcite .",
    "the relation between co luminosity , @xmath19 , and @xmath14 for these galaxies are similar to those of typical star - forming systems at lower redshift .",
    "however the relation between the black hole mass , @xmath20 and the bulge velocity dispersion of its host , @xmath21 , is seen to be above the local relation@xcite , indicating that the @xmath4 relation is evolving .",
    "this is true even when some of the assumptions , like degeneracy of @xmath21 with inclination angle are considered . even though there is still significant debate whether there may be observational biases influencing these results @xcite .",
    "recent observations with the refurbished hubble space telescope ( hst ) have yielded a considerably larger sample of more _ typical _ galaxies at @xmath22 .",
    "the newly installed wide field camera ( wfc3/ir ) and the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on the hst have been used to detect much fainter galaxies out to @xmath23 .",
    "these provide strong constraints on the uv luminosity function of galaxies @xcite at these redshifts .",
    "in addition wfc3/ir+acs in combination with the spitzer telescope has been used to detect the highest redshift ( @xmath24 ) galaxy till date @xcite .",
    "the uv luminosity function at these redshifts has been used to estimate the galaxy stellar mass function ( gsmf ) from @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "these observations of high redshift galaxies impose strong constraints on theoretical models of galaxy formation .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations ( with models for star formation ) have been carried out for studying the global properties of high redshift galaxies @xcite .",
    "they are able to reproduce the observed uv luminosity of these galaxies with some assumptions for extinction due to dust .",
    "however the shape of the gsmf @xcite is found to be inconsistent with those inferred from observations @xcite .",
    "these simulations do not model the growth of black holes and their feedback on the surrounding environment and are typically _ small _ in volume being incapable to host rare high - sigma peak objects .",
    "the requirement for large volumes and significant resolution to follow galaxy formation ( gas inflows into relatively small scales ) has made numerical studies of the growth of the first quasars extremely challenging .",
    "a number of approaches have resorted to constrained simulations . in a pioneering study ,",
    "@xcite high - resolution merger simulations with subgrid models for star formation and growth of black holes have been used to study the formation of @xmath0 quasars .",
    "this work extracted merger trees from large , coarse dark matter only simulations and identified the most massive halo candidate at @xmath26 .",
    "to simulate at high resolution the merger trees were populated with isolated galaxies which undergo the corresponding mergers and are then endowed with gas and models for star formation and black hole growth .",
    "this approach qualitatively reproduces the properties of the quasar sdss j1148 + 5251 and its host at @xmath27 .",
    "fully cosmological re - simulations of selected halos from the millenium run were also carried out in a more recent study by @xcite .",
    "this approach also finds that the most massive halos are consistent with being the first quasar hosts .    in order to study directly how and where the first quasars assemble , without a pre - imposed choice of halo , large cosmological volumes ( @xmath28 ) for capturing rare high - sigma peaks are required and sufficiently high - resolution in order to resolve kpc scales .",
    "high resolution is also necessary when including subgrid models for star - formation , black hole accretion and related feedback processes . keeping these constraints in mind we have run the largest ( currently feasible ) hydrodynamic simulation of its kind , , which includes gravity , hydrodynamics and subgrid models for star - formation , black hole growth and associated feedback processes .",
    "it was run in a cosmological volume of @xmath29 with @xmath30 billion particles ( dark matter + gas ) and a uniform gravitational softening of @xmath31 , with the code p - gadget which has been extensively modified from the public code gadget2 @xcite to run optimally on a large number of multicore processors .",
    "the simulations were carried out on @xmath32 cores of kraken at nics .",
    "has the same mass and force resolution ( as well as similar subgrid models for star formation , black hole growth and associated feedback processes ) as that of the resimulated halo of @xcite , however it does not rely on an imposed merger scenario to produce luminous quasars at @xmath0 and tracks the assembly of galaxies in a more self - consistent manner .",
    "the high redshift observations of galaxies , quasars and their hosts can be used to test standard models of galaxy formation in previously unexplored regimes .",
    "indeed has been instrumental in reproducing a number of observational properties of high - z quasars , e.g .",
    "the formation and abundances of sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) type black holes of mass @xmath9 at @xmath26 @xcite and also statistical properties , such as their luminosity function and high - redshift clustering @xcite . in this work",
    "we study the formation and properties of galaxies hosting @xmath33 quasars and as a sanity check we see how well observed global properties of galaxies compare with those in .",
    "our paper is organised as follows .",
    "we start with by describing the simulation in section  [ sec_methods ] . in section",
    "[ sec_global_props ] we compare the gsmf in with observations and earlier simulations .",
    "we next identify a sample of potential quasar host galaxies at @xmath0 and look at their formation and growth in sections  [ subsec_growth ] and [ subsec_coldflow ] . in section  [ subsec_obs ]",
    "we compare properties of these galaxies in with recent observations .",
    "we present our conclusions in section  [ sec_conclusion ] .",
    ".basic simulation parameters for the mb simulation .",
    "the columns list the size of the simulation box , @xmath34 , the number of dark matter particles used in the simulation , @xmath35 , the mass of a single dark matter particle , @xmath36 , the initial mass of a gas particle , @xmath37 , and the gravitational softening length , @xmath38 .",
    "all length scales are in comoving units . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath19 can then be converted to a cold molecular gas mass @xmath39 with @xmath40 @xcite . using these relations we look at the evolution of molecular gas for quasar host galaxies in the simulation and compare them with observations @xcite in the right panel of figure  [ fig_sfr ] shown as dot - dashed lines . here",
    "again we find that we are able to reproduce the amount of molecular gas in these galaxies at redshifts @xmath41 .",
    "the estimates are in better agreement than the observed sfr .",
    "@xcite also find that @xmath0 quasar hosts lie above the local @xmath14-@xmath19 relation and attribute it to unknown agn contributions to @xmath14 and different dust temperatures and co line ratios , even though they attempt to correct for agns .",
    "the ratio between @xmath42 and @xmath43 is typically 10% .",
    "this is much higher than 1% seen in observations of local galaxies @xcite .",
    "this indicates that @xmath0 quasar host galaxies are forming stars mores efficiently than local galaxies .",
    "we now look at the evolution of @xmath4 and the @xmath44 relation between the central black hole and its host galaxy , where @xmath21 is the velocity dispersion of the bulge , for which we use the velocity dispersion of stars within the half - mass radius as a proxy . given that the black hole grows faster than its host , as seen in figure  [ fig_sfrhalo ] we expect to see these relations to be steeper than the local relations , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the @xmath4 relation ( solid line ) is shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig_msigma ] for the sample .",
    "comparison is made to the best fit local relation ( dotted line ) @xcite and observations of @xmath45 quasar - host systems ( triangles ) @xcite . in this panel",
    "we show the evolution up to @xmath46 ( solid lines ) in order to better compare with observations at these redshifts and further down to @xmath47 ( dot - dashed lines ) .",
    "since the inclination angle is degenerate with the co linewidths , an average inclination angle of @xmath48 was assumed ( @xcite , filled triangles ) ; the open triangles relax this constraint . as expected we see that the black holes grow more rapidly than their host galaxies and eventually end up above the local relation of @xcite . by @xmath46",
    "the @xmath4 relation compares reasonably well with observations which assumes an inclination angle .",
    "however observations indicate that there is an object with @xmath49km / s and @xmath50 even when the assumption of inclination angle is considered .",
    "we do not find such an object within our sample and this discrepancy may have to do with the uncertainties in the inclination angle .",
    "next we look at the evolution of the @xmath5 relation in the simulation ( solid lines ) and compare with the best fit local relation of @xcite ( dotted line ) in the right panel of figure  [ fig_msigma ] . again consistent with previous properties such as the sfr-@xmath51 relation and the @xmath4 relation we find that the black hole is assembled more rapidly than the central host galaxy so that the @xmath5 relation is well above the local relation of @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting with future simulations to see what mechanisms eventually drive them to the local relation .",
    "the steep growth of @xmath20 which outpaces the stellar component of the host galaxy is common for all these systems and is again consistent with the fact that the accretion rate of the black hole as a function of redshift has a steeper slope than the sfr .",
    "the cyan and red lines in figure  [ fig_msigma ] correspond to the first two objects of in the top row of figure  [ fig_sfrhalo ] .",
    "a closer inspection shows that these objects undergo relatively dry mergers with subhalos in the feedback dominated phase .",
    "the subhalo has a larger stellar component compared to gas and therefore during this merger both @xmath21 and @xmath52 grow more rapidly than @xmath20 .",
    "this can be seen as a relative flattening of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 relation in figure  [ fig_msigma ] .",
    "it is plausible that dry mergers are responsible for eventually bringing the high redshift @xmath4 and @xmath5 relations onto the well constrained local relation @xcite",
    "has been successful in reproducing a number of important properties of quasars at high redshift within observational constraints : ( i ) the formation and abundances of sloan - type black holes of mass @xmath9 at @xmath26 @xcite , ( ii ) statistical properties such as the luminosity function of quasars and its evolution as well as their high - redshift clustering @xcite .",
    "importantly has indicated that cold flows can sustain the growth of black holes at eddington rates so that they attain masses of @xmath53 in a short time span @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have looked at the formation of galaxies hosting these @xmath33 quasars with the simulation .",
    "we are able to reproduce a number of observational properties of these galaxies .",
    "we summarize our findings below :    * we find good agreement between the theoretical gsmf produced by and observations at @xmath54 and @xmath26 .",
    "* at @xmath0 , @xmath9 black holes are already in place .",
    "the growth of the black hole and its host galaxy are strongly correlated .",
    "the black hole regulates the growth of its host galaxy .",
    "* black holes grow faster than the host galaxy and this is reflected in the deviations seen in our study from the local @xmath4 relation and @xmath5 relation ; our results are however consistent with observational findings for these deviations at @xmath0 . * the cold streams that feed the black hole are also responsible for feeding the host galaxy to sustain the excessive starburst in them .",
    "the accretion of gas , which eventually form stars in the host , through the _ hot mode _ is subdominant ( @xmath55 ) , the dominant fraction being accreted cold during their history .",
    "* host galaxies grow in extreme environments .",
    "we are able to reproduce the high sfr of @xmath56 seen in observations in redshifts @xmath3 .",
    "our simulation suggests that the observed galaxies are at the peak of their star - formation activity at these epochs .",
    "* our derived estimates of molecular gas in these galaxies are consistent with observations .",
    "such large reservoirs of cold molecular gas , @xmath57 are responsible for fuelling star - formation in these galaxies . * using the sfr as a proxy for @xmath42 we find that the ratio of molecular and cold gas is larger than seen for local galaxies .",
    "this again indicates the host galaxies are forming stars more efficiently than their local counterparts .",
    "* we find that most of the star formation occurs within a compact 3 - 6 kpc ( physical ) region around the black hole at the peak of its star - forming activity .",
    "these scales are again consistent with observations @xcite . * given that we are able to reproduce observations between @xmath58 our simulations suggests that these quasars and their host galaxies are seen at the peak of their assembly .    from the results presented here we expect that compared to the local universe the @xmath4 relation is very different in the high redshift universe .",
    "this has been indicated in earlier work @xcite , though the sample was too small to put strong constraints on the relation at @xmath59 and above .",
    "given the large volume and high resolution ( hence large sample of galaxies and black holes ) is well suited for predicting the evolution of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 relations at @xmath59 and above .",
    "it would also be interesting to look at the mechanisms responsible for their evolution .",
    "we will address these issues in subsequent work .",
